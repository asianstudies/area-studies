<i>Barely two months ago, on October 22, three Shabars were 
dragged out of their homes and heavily stoned in a paddy 
field of Bengal. One died, and two were seriously injured. 
When their women ran to file a complaint in the police station, 
the Officer in Charge refused to record their eye-witness evidence. 
Instead, he filed a case against the dead Shabar! ``This goes on

not only the Sahitya Akademi award and Jnanpith but Magsaysay,

<i>You have spent decades working for tribals. Why do you feel the 
need for greater awareness today, especially among the 
university goers?</i></font><P>

 I would go so far as to urge a special provision in the University 
for learning about them. For, unless the academicians and the elite 
of society start learning about the tribes and support their rights, the 
tribals' yearning to get a dignified place in India will never be fulfilled. 
Until that happens, I will use every possible forum to sensitise people 
about the de-notified tribes and communities.<P>

 It is now more than a year since the All India De-Notified Tribes and 
Communities Right Action Group was set up. But few recognise them 
as living creatures. As Namwar Singh said at a Delhi University 
function, "All these years I have lived in Delhi, I have never spared 
a thought for the Kanjars, Bawarias, Pardhis, Sasis..'' But for the major 
crimes committed in the Capital, they are victimised. What is more crucial, 
when they need all the understanding and protection, they are being 
shown on TV channels as the most wanted criminals.<P>

<i>How did the Group come about?</i></font><P>

 I have been working for the tribes of Bengal for three decades. 
Last year when Budhan, a member of the Shabar tribe I am connected 
with, was killed, I filed a PIL in the Calcutta High Court. The responsible 
police officers were suspended, a CBI inquiry is on and the widow was 
awarded a compensation of Rs 1 lakh. Naturally, when I was asked to 
deliver the Verrier Elwin Memorial lecture in Baroda last year, I spoke 
about the denotified tribes. It led to the setting up of the Denotified and 
Nomadic Tribes and Communities Right Action Group. Marathi writer 
Lakshman Gaekwad is the vice president and G N Devy is the secretary 
of the Group which brings out a bulletin named <i>Budhan</i></font>.<P>

<i>How many such tribes are there today?</i></font><P>

 There are more than 200 tribes and communities, with the population 
numbering between 5 and 6 crore. The nomadic ones cannot vote 
because of police persecution and constant wandering about. The 
British had notified them in 1871 as Criminals and passed the Criminal 
Tribes Act, though not all were tribes -- some were simply castes. 
The Government of India denotified them in 1952, but in 1959 passed 
the Habitual Offenders Act. It is a repetition of the Act of 1871, with 
minor change of words. So now, they are oppressed by both, the 
police and society.<P>

<i>Haven't the societal changes of the past decade changed their 
lifestyle and their status?</i></font><P>

 Not really. Because all the development schemes initiated for the 
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Castes, 
are not applied to them. Therefore, at the age of 75, I am desperate. 
I urge the government to bring all of them under a general category, 
De-Notified Communities. This DNC should include all SCs, STs and 
OBCs, but can have a subplan for the nomadic ones. They can be 
brought into the fold of development by giving land, facilities of 
education, health. Women's development can be made possible 
under Indira Awas Yojana. Non-formal vocational training centres 
can be opened. Above all, I appeal to the media not to project the 
police version alone but to go and make enquiries on their own and 
write field reports on their real condition, so that people understand 
the reality. Had they been such big criminals, they would not have 
lived in such abject poverty.<P>

<i>Why do the police pick on them for crimes?</i></font><P>

 In 1952, when they were denotified, the police and the receivers of 
stolen goods kept them engaged in criminal activities. For many such 
communities, crime is the only way to survive. Otherwise they suffer 
persecution, both by the police and society. But they continue to live 
in dehumanised conditions everywhere, whether in the metropolises or 
in the remote villages. I speak from personal experience. I have seen 
about 60 Lodhas and Shabars of West Bengal being killed for either 
theft or dacoity, but not a single receiver of stolen goods has been 
brought to book. The situation in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh 
is much worse; Delhi is no better. On December 3, policemen from 
the Baramati Police Station killed three sleeping Pardhis and 
grievously injured four persons. Two of these were women. I cannot 
help but ask, again and again: Why do the big swindlers and power 
wielders go unpunished? Why do these communities pay the price 
all the time?<P>

<i>How has your tryst with tribals influenced your literature?</i></font><P>

 It is not new for my literature to spring from a fight for the rights 
of these oppressed and downtrodden people. The tribal revolt 
against the British at the turn of the century formed the backbone 
of <i>Aranyer Adhikar</i></font>, which the Sahitya Akademi had 
singled out for their awards. My social activism is the driving force 
of all my literary activities, be it literature -- which brought me into 
the good books of Jnanpith -- my newspaper columns or the journal 
I edit, with writing by members of different tribes. The lives of the 
bonded labour provided me with a character like <i>Dopadi</i></font>. 
Perhaps their stories also impart a narrative immediacy to my language.<P>

<i>And the Magsaysay? Was it for your art or activism?</i></font><P>

 In the words of the award council, it was "for her compassionate 
crusade through art and activism to claim for tribal peoples a just 
and honourable place in India's national life.''<P>

<i>But in the recent months your activism seems to have completely 
taken over your literature?</i></font><P>

 I did write three stories and novelettes in July. But then I had 
a stroke which forced me to rest. This is the first time since 
then that I have stepped out of Calcutta. I have come only to 
make our thinkers and policy makers see the reality of the 
denotified tribes. I had gone to Bhopal for a seminar on the 
subject. It was also the focus of my talk at the Delhi University. 
And it will take up every waking hour of my stay in Baroda, 
the head quarters of the Group.<p>
