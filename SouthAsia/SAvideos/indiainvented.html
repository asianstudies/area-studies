                <p><a name="one"></a>1. <b>Exploring Indian history</b>. Part 1 presents an overview of India's past
                with a suggestion that history is the account of long term change in the
                day-to-day lives of ordinary people.

                <p><a name="two"></a>2. <b>Dawn of civilization</b>. Part 2 covers the huge historical period from
                the Old Stone Age to the coming of the Aryans to the Indian Sub-continent.
                It also takes a look at the famous Harappan Civilisation.

                <p><a name="thre"></a>3. <b>Age of enlightenment</b>. Part 3 looks at the Sixth Century B.C., when
                different schools of thought flowered and focuses on the two major
                philosophical orders that arose in this time: Jainism and Buddhism.

                <p><a name="four"></a>4. <b>Age of iron</b>. Part 4 centers around the Iron Age, an era that opened
                around 1000 B.C. and also carries out an analysis of the rule of the
                righteous Ashoka in this context.

                <p><a name="five"></a>5. <b>The Buddha overtaken</b>. Part 5 captures the historical context of the
                virtual disappearance of Buddhism from India for several centuries and
                examines the hypothesis that it was the changing nature of the economy that
                rendered organised Buddhism more or less redundant for a long period.

                <p><a name="six"></a>6. <b>The spice of life</b>. Part 6 describes the history of South India including
                the development of a distinct culture in this region, the building of huge
                temples, the extension of agriculture and the creation of irrigation
                systems.

                <p><a name="seve"></a>7. <b>The long twilight</b>. Part 7 looks at feudalism in India, a feature that
                dominated much of the early Christian era in Indian history.

                <p><a name="eigh"></a>8. <b>Pilgrims' progress</b>. Part 8 covers the different forms of spirituality
                which developed in India, from pantheism and animism to organized religion
                and shows how the Indian culture has been formed by collective spiritual
                quests from the earliest times to the present.

                <p><a name="nine"></a>9. <b>Islam comes to Hindustan</b>. Part 9 revolves around one of the largest
                influences that shaped medieval and modern Indian history: the coming of
                Muslims to the sub-continent.

                <p><a name="ten"></a>10. <b>West meets East</b>. Part 10 looks at the coming of Europeans to India,
                beginning with early contacts with Portuguese, French, and British
                voyagers. It also captures the story of how trade led to colonization and
                finishes off with a look at the advent of British rule over India.

                <p><a name="elev"></a>11. <b>The age of empire</b>. Part 11 covers the Mughul empire, the greatest and
                grandest of its time in the world. It takes a look at the economic and
                social structure of the Mughal rule and also carries out an analysis of the
                political and religious policies of the various Mughal rulers.

                <p><a name="twel"></a>12. <b>Colonial encounters</b>. Part 12 centers around the consolidation of
                British rule in India, the policies of the British East India Company, the
                devastating economic impact of colonialism and the rise of nationalist
                forces in the country.

                <p><a name="thir"></a>13. <b>The nation comes of age</b>. Part 13 looks at the several civilisational
                trends that have formed India over the centuries and attempts to reinforce
                the idea that runs through the series that Indian history lives on in its
                past.
