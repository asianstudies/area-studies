<P><B>&nbsp;Written Assignments</B> 
<BR>There are two written assignments for this course 
<BR>First assignment - <B>DUE JANUARY 25TH</B> 
<BR>This is a 2 page paper, written in correct academic style. All
quotations or ideas which are not your own need to be properly cited. No
research is required, although it is not discouraged. In this paper, I
want to hear what you think about the issue you have selected, not a
restatement of themes discussed in class or in the readings. I am
looking for good ideas, and opportunities for you to explore your
writing abilities.  <BR>Some potential topics for this paper are:
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> Is censorship in India (or another South
Asian country) necessary? Explain your determination.
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> 
Explain why the popular cinema industry in India (or another South Asian 
country) is or is not ruled by the same compulsions as Hollywood is. 
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> Given a different ideological bent, in what
other way could the editors of Amar Chitra Katha’s comic book series
have altered the major characters in their series?
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> Explain the popularity of Mother India or
why you are surprised at its popularity.
 
<B></B> 
<P><BR><B>FINAL PAPER - DUE MARCH 10TH</B> 
<BR>The final paper should be 10-15 pages long. It should be written in
proper research, academic style. There are several style manuals
available (at the bookstore or at the library) including the Chicago
Manual of Style, Strunk and White, or others. Consult one of these
manuals, select one of the styles, and stick with it. I am not
particular about what particular style you select, just that you are
consistent and clear. Let me know if you have trouble finding what you
need.  <BR>Possible topics are:
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> &nbsp;What role has media played in the
Indo-Pakistan conflicts since Independence?
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> &nbsp;What role has media played in the rise
of Hindu Nationalism in India since the mid 1980’s?
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> &nbsp;Examine a pre-mechanical age art form,
such as dance or drama. How has it been portrayed in film? How has it
been altered by film?
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> How has the commercial cinema dealt with
representing the many different ethnic groups in Indian society? Why has
this topic been dealt with in the way it has?
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> Discuss how women are portrayed in South
Asian media, how this portrayal has changed over the last 50 years, and
what it has meant for family and other social constructions.
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> Examine the effects of the spread of
televisions, television viewership and viewing of non-South Asian
produced materials on a South Asian audience.
 
<BR><IMG SRC="redball.gif"> 
There are a plethora of other potential topics, including sex, violence,
religion, modernity, music, nationalism, Gandhism, history, politics,
and many others, which could be a fruitful area of research, and I am
very open to ideas other than those outlined above. Please discuss with
me whatever topic you select.
