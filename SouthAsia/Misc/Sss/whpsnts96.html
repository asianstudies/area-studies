<h3>Bihar's elections showed social justice is for the voter to
define and the politician to implement.</h3></center>

<hr>

     Many rich ironies have surfaced in the political drama
played out in New Delhi in the days since the elections, none
perhaps more poignant than those involving the president of the
Janata Dal and the sitting chief minister of Bihar, the
honourable Laloo Prasad Yadav. Not yet 48 this remarkable man has
served as chief minister of India's second largest state longer
than any of his predecessors other than Shri Krishna Sinha, who
assumed that office as early as the first Congress ministry in
1937,and remained chief minister without interruption from May
1946 until his death in 1961. Yadav's six years in office is
already an exceedingly impressive record of political longevity.<p>

     He was named leader of the Janata Dal legislature party
following the 1990 assembly elections and became chief minister
in March of that year. In the parliamentary elections on May and
June 1991, the Janata Dal won 32 seats outright. With the support
of its National Front-Left Front allies, the Communist Party of
India with eight seats, the Communist Party of India(Marxist)
one, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha with six, and one independent, it
controlled 48 of the 54 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party won
five seat sin that elections, all in Jharkhand, and the Congress,
one seat in Begusarai. This was a political dominance for the
Janata Dal and its National Front-Left Front partners almost
unknown in Indian electoral history.<p>

     The dramatic electoral dominance of 1991 was confirmed in
the legislative assembly elections of 1995 when the Laloo Prasad
Yadav-Janata Dal wave literally swept aside all opposition with
an absolute majority of 165 seats in an assembly of 324. With its
CPI and CPI(M) allies, which had 26 and six seats respectively,
the Janata Dal thus controlled 196 seats and with 41 seats, the
BJP trailed far behind as the main opposition. The Congress had
30, the JMM 16, other Jharkhand par-ties six, and the Communist
Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) six, the recently formed Samata
Party five, independents 13 and other parties 10.<p>

     On the surface this appeared to be both an enviable and an
unassailable position of power, and Yadav's own image of
invincibility was confirmed by his being named all India
president of the Janata Dal. One of the many ironies in this
history is that it was only then that the New Delhi media took
serious notice of Yadav and almost immediately began to see him
as a potential candidate for prime ministership.<p>

     For five years he had been widely dismissed by the urban press as a
rustic buffoon, speaking not only the language but using the idioms of
the poor.  Yet now he was seen as a prime minister in waiting. Of
course, both images were flawed, the first because it ignored the
absolutely brilliant skills of a complex and consummate populist
political campaigner and vote getter, the second because it ignored what
are widely considered to be his limits as an administrator and his
apparent failure to apprehend the very idea of systematic development
and change, leave alone to engage in its implementation.  In the meantime,
with Yadav's new image as a major political player, ambassadors and
diplomats soon found their way to Patna to meet this political wonder of
the common man, and the chief minister assured one and all that his
second term would be one not only of social justice for the poor,
stability and communal harmony, but economic growth and development. And
trips to southeast Asia and the United States, and the Patna conference
of the non-resident Indians, who signed memoranda of understandings
galore, seemed evidence enough to the New Delhi press that the benighted
Bihar had finally found a leader to match their potential. There was
scarcely a weekly news magazine or newspaper supplement that did not
carry a feature story of the redoubtable Yadav as campaigner and man of
the people. Laloo bhaiyya was described as the <i><b>raja</b></i>, the
messiah of the poor, the <i><b>desh ka neta</b></i> who would carry the
message of social justice, self respect, and economic redemption for the
poor of Bihar, to New Delhi itself. Indeed, <b><i>Dilli chalo</i></b>,
became both the symbol and substance of the chief minister's campaign
message in 1996.<p>

     His public self assurance carried through the final day of
campaigning on May 5, as did the press reports suggesting that
the voters were indeed mesmerised by their Laloo <b><i>bhaigga</i></b> and were
solidly behind him, the complaints of people along the way about
roads, electricity, pensions, <b><i>pakka</i></b> houses, and the <b><i>saris</i></b> and
<b><i>dhotis</i></b> he had promised everyone below the poverty line,
notwithstanding. Of course, Yadav promised everything in good
time, explaining that in the meantime he had already repealed
toddy tapping and fishing taxes, among other achievements meant
to benefit the poor.<p>

     By campaign's end, he appeared in virtually all
constituencies which had not yet gone to the polls, making as
many as seven or eight campaign stops a day, at one hour, and
sometimes 30 minute intervals, moving by helicopter, then
finishing, as he did at Kurtha in Jehanabad constituency of
central Bihar on May 2, with village stops along the way in his
<b><i>garib chetna rath</i></b>.  This converted bus was used literally and
figuratively as the vehicle to project the awareness and self
respect of the poor.<p>

     It was a low key approach but brilliantly effective in the
hands of this quintessentially populist chief minister. This was
not the <b><i>rath</i></b> of the south Indian movie heroes turned
politician, or of Lal Krishna Advani of the BJP, but an entirely
unpretentious rath of the poor, the common people of rural Bihar.<p>

     And when he invited them to New Delhi for tea, or to vote
for the sitting CPI candidate in Kurtha, "who will raise his hand
on my behalf, so the poor will have a voice in New Delhi," he did
so with understated calculation.  "When you make me the prime
minister, we will bring money from New Delhi to help the poor of
Bihar", he said.<p>

     In all of this, he neither appeared disingenuous, nor was he
lecturing his peasant audience of 4,000, but in effect talking
with them, as if he were sitting in their village huts, as in
fact he often did. They laughed with him when he explained that
many untouchable Musahars now had pakka roofs on their houses,
whereas poor upper caste Bhumihar Brahmins did not, "but we will
do that too, if you vote for the CPI/Janata Dal ticket".<p>

     He was quietly but pointedly rein-forcing the social justice
theme of his first term, of assuring self respect, <b><i>izzat </i></b>to the
socially and economically deprived of the land. Then he explained
in great detail how to vote, how to mark the ballot, how to stamp
it on the appropriate party symbol, how to fold it and place lt
in the ballot box, as he dropped a sample ballot between the
microphones where he as seated.<p>

     It was a disarming and impressive performance, and while the
voters of this constituency gave his candidate a strong winning
margin, for the state as a whole, of course they did not. My
sense was that the Peasant voters I observed at Kurtha were
intent on listening and learning, and they were often amused by
their chief minister, with whom they felt completely relaxed, but
they were obviously not mesmerised as the press described these
encounters.<p>

     And of course as we now know, something went badly
wrong.  Comparing the 1996 Bihar results with 1991, the Janata Dal
is down from 32 to 22 of the 54 Lok Sabha seats, the CPI down
from eight to four seats, while the CPI (M) has lost its lone
seat giving the National Front-Left Front combine in Bihar a
total of 26. E the Samajwadi Party candidate from Purnea supports
the National Front-Left Front as seems likely, then that total
would be 27, as compared to the 48 of 1991. The JMM stood
independency of the National Front-Left Front in 1996 and was
reduced from six seats to one in the new Parliament.<p>

     However one juggles these numbers, defections to the Samata
Party and the Congress in the iterim notwithstanding, the Janata.
Dal decline from its near total dominance of 1991 is certainly
significant. In the meantime, the Congress, which had one seat in
1991, lost that seat but won two others, while the BJP improved
dramatically from five to 18 seats, capturing 12 of the 14 seats
in tribal Jharkhand, and six in north and central Bihar. Its
anti-Laloo partner in this election, the Samata Party, which was
formed in 1994 as a breakaway of the Janata Dal, won six seats,
giving that combine 24 seats. This means that the Janata Dal,
National Front-Left Front combine and the BJP-Samata Party
alliance will be essentially equal in strength of their Lok Sabha
numbers, with two seats to the Congress, and one for the JMM.<p>

     The political calculus of these results as a function of
splits in the backward caste, Dalit and Muslim alliance which
Laloo crafted before and after the 1980 and 1991 elections has
been examined in the public press in elaborate detail. I will
only repeat here that the creation of the Samata Party in 1994,
as a reaction to the "Yadavisation" of the Janata Dal in the
minds of many Kurmi and Koeri castes, and the alliance of that
party with the BJP has in effect contrived a new and successful
backward caste/upper caste anti-Laloo alliance, further
marginalising the Congress which is already badly fractured in
Bihar.<p>

     Obviously, these various combinations and recombinations
involving caste, class and creed are relevant in understanding
the results of this or any other election. But it is what the
sociologist, Dipankar Gupta, refers to as specific secular and
political interests, and to which I would add economic interests
and personality interactions which governs how people vote.<p>

     As is true for any social or religious segment of society,
whether Muslim, Yadav, Kurmi, Rajput, or whatever, these are never
unitary solidarities in any political sense. And the fragmenting
of the MY factor-the Muslim and Yadav support base of the Janata
Dal- in the 1996 election in Bihar is a good case in point, as is
the upper/backward caste alliance of the BJP/Samata as an
anti-Yadav formation. However, my explanatory argument goes
beyond this social and political calculus to suggest that issues
of political freedom as well as economic and social freedom and
the allied issues of social justice and self respect have a long
history in Bihar. These are fundamental human rights in this
society as in any other, and Yadav, coming as he did out of the
student movement of the early and middle Seventies, has certainly
brought the issue and the idea to a new level of awareness in
Bihar. But to repeat, the concept is not new in Bihar or
elsewhere in the country for that matter.<p>

     I think here of names like Swami Sahajanand, Panchanan
Sharma, Jadunaridan Sharma, Karyanand Sharma, Kishori Prasanna
Singh, Ramnandan Mishra, Dhanraj Sharma, Ganga Sharan Sinha and
Jayaprakash Narayan, among many, many others.  And of movements
like the Kisan Sabha, the Triveni Sangh, the Bihar Socialist
Party, and other parties of the left, mostly under the umbrella
of the Congress, whose activisms and objectives were in a very
fundamental sense of, by and for the people. Few will know that
it was Yadav peasants who, in 1927, pleaded with Sahajanand to
aid them in their struggles against the Bhumihar Brahmin
zamindars of Masaurhi, and that it was from that beginning that
the most powerful peas-ant movement in India, the Bihar
provincial Kisan Sabha, emerged. And among the many beneficiaries
of that movement were precisely those productive and upwardly
mobile middle caste groups now courted so assiduously by the
Janata Dal, the Samata Party the Congress, and indeed, the BJP.<p>

     It is also revealing to note that Sahajanand and the Kisan
Sabha were equally seized with the issue of equity,justice and
izzat for the poorest of the poor. These are issues to which all
par-ties lay claim in 1996, including, especially, the CPI(ML),
which is active in many parts of the state, but primarily in
those ares where Kisan Sabha itself was most active in the
Thirties. The near equal division of the vote in the Arrah
constituency in 1996 between the Janata Dal, the Samata Party,
the CPI(ML), and the Congress, in that order, makes these points
nicely. Two recently published political tracts of Sahajanand's
from 1941 are especially revealing of this history, at a time
when Sahajanand was already using the term Dalit, well before it
came into common use as a description for the exploited poor. I
refer to <a name="saha">Sahajanand</a> on

     It is this history and its memory 1996 which provides the
citizen voters of Bihar, across the political and social
spectrum, a strong sense of their place and their rights in this
society. And it reinforces the high expectations of performance
they demand from the political leaders they elect. <p>

     I recall the response of Karpoori Thakur during the
Emergency of Indira Gandhi when she rationalized that Westminster
democracy was not meant for countries like India. What Indians
wanted and needed was bread. Karpoori who was underground at the 
time explained pointedly "Hamko azadi aur roti chahiye," that is,
we want freedom and bread, a memorable observation I take to be
deeply etched in the collective mind of the citizen voters of
India and Bihar.<p>

     Putting that logic in the context of 1996, one might say
that the voters of Bihar have given a similar message, to wit,
"<b><i>Hamko izzat, roti, dhoti, aur pakka makan chahiye</i></b>," namely, we
want self respect yes, but we also want bread, dhotis, and parka
houses. In other words, the voters of Bihar have supported
massively the idea of social justice and self respect, and
perhaps now they are reminding the political establishment chat
they want performance, an improvement in the quality of life,
symbolised in the broadest sense in the roti, dhoti, pakka makan
metaphor.<p>

     It has been said that 1996 was an election without issues,
but I suspect what is being said is that it was an election
without catchy slogans. I have referred above to what we in the
US refer to as bread and butter issues, or gut issues, which are
equally important issues in India. To push the point further, for
example, if teachers and non-gazetted employees are not paid
their salaries for months and months on end, that is clearly an
issue which will agitate the electorate.<p>

     And in Bihar, Laloo Prasad Yadav was himself an issue. And
some observers felt that voters were oblivious of or unconcerned
with the multi-million animal husbandry scandal, thinking that
inasmuch as everyone did it, why hold the current incumbents
liable? But I am persuaded that this was a bad misreading of the
sensibilities of the citizen voters of Bihar. They were not only
aware of what was happening but deeply pained and offended that
their Laloo bhaiyya might have betrayed them. His opposition to a
Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry, now enforced by the
Patan high court and sustained by the Supreme Court, did little
to allay their anxieties.<p>

     What the recent arrest of Shyami Bihari Sinha, the regional
director of animal husbandry and the main accused may mean, of
course only time will tell. But certainly the attempted suicide of
the animal husbandry minister when he lost in the Bagha
constituency, suggests that he too thought that the fodder
scandal, extending over a period of 15 years, was a potent issue.<p>

     The message the voters have sent in the 1996 elections may
not be neat and clean, but then it never is in a time of
transition. But it is patently clear to those who will listen. <p>
