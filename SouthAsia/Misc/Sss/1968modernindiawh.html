<P>India is a complex society, and the complexities of her social and cultural life carry over into and
 are reflected in her political life. One way of unraveling these
complexities is by identifying the apparently conflicting dichotomies
one finds in Indian life and thought, and tracing the reactions which
the encounter between them produces.</P>

<P>There is in Indian life a kind of dialectic-for every theme or
characteristic there is a counter-theme or counter-characteristics. In
the broadest sense there is the relationship between elements of unity
and diversity, with which we are all familiar, of which Jawaharlal Nehru
spoke and wrote so profoundly, and which Philip Mason has analyzed so
brilliantly in a recent essay.<A NAME="rf01"></A> <A
HREF="#N_01_"><SUP>(1)</SUP></A> A related and crucial dichotomy at the
present point in time is the relationship between the traditional and
the modern elements in Indian life, and in this context one might
consider the relationship between the democratic processes which India
has adopted and her hierarchical social values, or between violence and
non-violence, and many others in a similar vein.</P>

<P>Mason's analysis incorporates many of these dichotomies. He examines
five areas of diversity in Indian society and then</P>

<P>++Page 29</P>

<P>asks to what extent these diversities are likely to affect political
stability and unity. To what extent do they concern society and to what
extent do they concern the State? This distinction is an important one
for it implies, as Mason suggests, not only that the reconciling and
unifying characteristics of the traditional and social milieu can affect
and indeed be duplicated in the political sphere, but that the
diversities of the traditional milieu may also affect the political
sphere.</P>

<P>It is with this traditionalizing effect in Indian politics and what I
take to be its new tendencies and consequences that I want to concern
myself in this paper. I will elaborate Mason's socio-political model on
the basis of what has happened in India since 1966 when Mason and his
colleagues wrote.</P>

<P>The five areas of diversity Mason describes are religion, language,
region, tribe, and caste, and the divisions between the educated,
middle-class elite and the mass of India's peasant population. Mason
assesses the diversities each of these factors brings to Indian society.
By and large he finds in all of them modifying, unifying tendencies
rather than divisive tendencies. To quote Mason: "There are plenty of
dangers which affect both [society and the State] and they have strong
quasi-racial elements, but the overwhelming impression conveyed to me by
the essays in this book is that the tough network of fibres binding
Indian society into a whole will continue to hold. The divisive forces
which simulate racial barriers are in retreat".<A NAME="rf02"></A><A
HREF="#N_02_"><SUP>(2)</SUP></A> Similarly, in politics Mason notes that
"the choice between extremes has so far been refused",<A
NAME="rf03"></A> <A HREF="#N_03_"><SUP>(3)</SUP></A> the mediating
influence here being the Congress Party which represents many diverse
groups and interests but which, like the Hindu tradition, is tolerant
and compromising of these variant interests. In this sense, Mason
argues, a stable society is linked with the State through the political
machine that is the Congress Party. This machine bears many
resemblances</P>

<P>++Page 30</P>

<P>to the society in which it operates and this, as Mason says again, is
a source of strength. But it may also be a source of weakness as I have
indicated above, in that politics may at some point come to absorb the
divisive characteristics of the society. Mason's term is that the
"recipe for a stable society may not be the recipe for a stable
state".<A NAME="rf04"></A><A HREF="#N_04_"><SUP>(4)</SUP></A></P>

<P>Crises require action and not compromise and when the political
system does not produce responsible action at appropriate times it is
susceptible to change. For two years India has had a very grave crisis,
focussed on the problem of supplying the basic food needs of a growing
population, now numbering in the vicinity of 515 million persons. Though
the critical food shortages of 1966 and 1967 have been relieved with
bumper crops in late 1967 and early 1968, and food grain purchases from
abroad, particularly the United States, significant stresses in the
social fabric are apparent, with pressures that have resulted in a
re-orientation of economic planning and development, and the emergence
of new political patterns. The disruptions of many of the state
governments in India in 1967 and 1968 involving the failure of Congress,
and non-Congress coalition governments, suggests that if basic needs are
not met, new alternatives will be sought. In this situation tensions
latent in the traditional society may come to the surface -- the point
with which Mason concludes his essay.5 I am now suggesting that the
traditionalizing influences of religion, language and caste in the
modern democratic processes of India have always been in the
conservative direction of the traditional, hierarchical, rural society
in which they have operated; in other words, to the right end of the
political spectrum. Morris-Jones makes the same point when he says:
"the traditional way tends to point to the right and certainly points
away from the centre.<A NAME="rf05"></A><A
HREF="#N_05_"><SUP>(5)</SUP></A> I am further suggesting that when a
crisis of scarcity leads to political instability, frustra-</P>

<P>++Page 31</P>

<P>ion, violence and agitation, the traditional conservative tendencies
of Indian society will move to support increasingly right, authoritarian
groups who exploit traditional loyalties in highly nationalistic
terms.</P>

<P>There is a strong authoritarian strand in Indian life and experience.
Indeed, the line between the democratic political institutions which
have been sustained by a traditional, essentially rural society, and the
authoritarian institutions which could well be sustained by such a
society, is a very fine one.</P>

<P>I think therefore that what we are seeing is the beginning of a major
shift in Indian politics in the direction of growing strength on the
communal right. If under these circumstances the Congress Party is able
to maintain its influence in those states to which it has been reduced,
a strong two-party situation could emerge. An equally plausible prospect
would be a polarization around political extremes in which the chief
beneficiaries of any reaction to the communal right would be the
Communist parties on the left. But this is in the realm of conjecture
and beyond the concern of this paper. I turn now to the traditionalizing
process in Indian politics.</P>

<B>Modern vs. Traditional</B></P>

<P>It is perhaps going too far to suggest that we are dealing here with
what Gabriel Almond called a conflict between two political cultures. I
prefer Morris-Jones' description of the encounter between the political
system and the social structure as a contrast between the modern and
traditional "languages" or "idioms" of politics."<A NAME="rf06"></A> <A
HREF="#N_06_"><SUP>(6)</SUP></A> When we speak of the modern language of
politics in India we mean those institutions operated by, and in part
developed by, a relatively small, Westernized, educated elite:
Parliament, the constitution, a well-established judicial system, a
civil service able in the administration of government and development,
the press, and the top leadership of the political parties.  This small
educated elite group has been committed to the idea of a democratic,</P>

<P>++Page 32</P>

<P>secular, national welfare state, with everything this means in the
Indian context, and has used the modern institutions at its disposal as
a means of persuading Indian society as a whole that these modern values
and institutions are in India's best interest. This modern idiom has in
fact been communicated widely in Indian society, and widely accepted.
The development of a viable party system with an able leadership, the
widespread acceptance of electoral politics, and indeed the use of these
modern institutions, parties, elections and legislatures, by the
traditional communal parties themselves for their own ends, indicates
how extensive and important a part of Indian life the modern language of
politics has become. It should be interjected here too, that its
influence has been essentially a stabilizing one.</P>

<P>Historically it has been through the Congress Party and its top
leadership that the secular, democratic, modernizing conceptions of the
modern political idiom have been diffused most widely in Indian society.
But it is <I>within</I> the Congress Party that the traditional and the
modem idioms have been most significantly mixed providing, as I have
indicated above, both strengths and weaknesses to the party. The
Congress was returned with heavy majorities at the Center and in all
states in the first three general elections. The only exception was the
state of Kerala in South India which elected a Communist government in
1957.  These successes reflected the Congress position as legatee of the
nationalist movement with a strong leadership cadre at all levels, a
systematic national organization and a planned program of national
growth and development. Another reason for Congress Party success was
that it made its appeal to all elements in Indian society in economic
and social terms that were understandable. It is at this point that the
traditional and the modern idioms came together in the Party. It was in
a sense all things to all people, and in more ways than one has been
described as an umbrella under which all class, caste, religious and
ideological interests might find a home. This has been true, and within
a dominant political party these various interests have tended to
develop</P>

<P>++Page 33</P>

<P>factions and, especially at the state level, provide the political
system with built-in opposition groups. In some instances this process
of accommodation of different interests has worked to the advantage of
the Congress Party and strengthened it, as we indicated above, while in
other cases the factionalizing process became an end in itself in the
effort to achieve and hold power. In those cases the Congress has been
weakened and its ability to cope with the problems of internal
development and national growth also weakened, with results that have
been disastrous.</P>

<P>Though the literacy rate in India is only 30 per cent, the Indian
electorate has reacted to this situation with great sophistication. In
the 1967 elections, in the midst of the food crisis of 1966 and 1967,
the Congress Party majority was significantly reduced at the Center and
it retained control of only seven of the sixteen state legislatures. In
several states the Party is in process of dissolution. Several states,
including the large and important South Indian state of Madras, are
under opposition control, and in the others the past year has been one
of instability and political chaos. Fourteen state ministries have
fallen, shaky coalitions of all political groups have come and gone, and
in those states where parliamentary procedures have broken down
completely, President's Rule-control by the Central government,
preceding new elections or a new ministry-has been imposed. West Bengal,
for example, rejected the Congress in the February, 1967, elections and
a coalition of fourteen parties, primarily Socialist and Communist
groups and some dissident Congressmen, came into power. The government
tolerated, and some of its members induced, a series of strikes that
crippled industrial production, which in turn caused wide-spread
unemployment, agitation and rioting in Calcutta. In early 1968
President's Rule was imposed and new elections have been set for
November of this year. One can say that the voters are equally
disenchanted with the opposition parties as they were with the Congress.
Neither fulfilled its promises.</P>

<P>The pattern of one-party dominance and the stability</P>

<P>++Page 33</P>

<P>which it has brought India is changing rapidly. This is in a very
real sense a time of transition.  There will be more opposition to the
Congress Party and to any government in power and more options open to
the voters who are looking not for the "good things of life" but for an
indication that some of their those needs that will succeed. From the
point of view of the Congress, it should be said here that once the
process of political upheaval in the political system begins, as it
already has, shifts in the economic fortunes of the country will not
stop the process. They may affect the process, but they will not stop
it. Accordingly, the changes we have indicated and the factors affecting
them will continue to operate, the new food situation
notwithstanding.</P>

<P>In discussing the political system thus far I have suggested that
there are important elements in both modern and traditional institutions
that contribute to stability and unity, and elements in the traditional
order that may have a disjunctive effect on the existing political
scheme of things. In a traditional society, cultural and social
loyalties do impinge profoundly on the political system. These
traditional loyalties, I would argue, are particularly important in a
democratic society and in an a society of scarcity. Before Independence
political leaders thought and worked in broad national terms: after
Independence they continued to think in such terms, but they were also
susceptible to a mass electorate, and this meant responding to its
demands and in significant respects adopting its traditional complexion.
We may refer to this process as the "traditionalizing" or the
"Indianizing" of politics. Its influences in the political life of the
nation have been profound.</P>

<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"
WIDTH="39" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A><B>The Impact of Religion</B></P>

<P>First among the traditional loyalties, in their long-term impact on
the political life of South Asia, is religion. Albeit a secular state,
with wide religious representation among its</P>

<P>++Page 35</P>

<P>people and a deep secular outlook among its top leadership (the
President of India is a Muslim), India is nevertheless essentially a
Hindu society. The problems of religious division in the moves of South
Asia to independence have left deep emotional scars close to the surface
and large religious minorities in both India and Pakistan. I cite two
developments from among many to indicate the growing importance of
religious loyalties in the political life of India.</P>

<P>There are a number of communal political parties and quasi-political
groups at work in India today. The Jan Sangh (People's Party) is the
chief party of the communal, or religious right. The party bases its
appeal on the Hindu-ness of India vis-a-vis Muslim Pakistan and the 50
million Muslim minority in India itself. It has both an internal and an
external bogey-man. It has helped create and it has certainly exploited
the vigorous nationalist sentiments now apparent in India in relation to
most of its neighbors.  The party was founded in 1951 and has gradually
gained strength, initially with the support of small town business men,
but increasingly in rural, municipal and state elections, primarily in
northern India. But the party is well-organized, with a dedicated cadre
of workers active in many parts of India, including the South where in
the past it has had limited appeal. In the recent Bombay municipal
elections it jumped from one to four seats, but it ran thirty-five
candidates. It is this increase in activity and its spread beyond its
traditional northern base that is important. What importance the
mysterious death of Deen Dayal Upadhyay, one of the party's moderate
leaders, has had in these developments is difficult to say. There is,
however, strong evidence in the election results of 1967, and in party
activity since, that the Jan Sangh as a political force appealing to
elementary and traditionally Indian sentiments will become much stronger
in the years ahead. It would appear that the communal right will be one
of the chief beneficiaries of the confusion left by the Congress and the
coalition governments in many states since 1967. This will be a
long-term process, but I feel the evidence points in that direction. The
party has</P>

<P>++Page 36</P>

<P>not only shown strength in the urban areas, but, for example, in
rural Bihar where it was virtually non-existent, it has now shown
surprising vitality.</P>

<P>Bihar has also been the scene of some of the most violent communal
rioting in India since independence.  Evidence in this area is extremely
difficult to come by, and it is quite understandably a highly sensitive
problem in India. I am suggesting here, and this matter would have to be
further pursued before firm assertions could be made, that there is a
growing tendency to communalism in Indian life, Hindu against Muslim and
vice versa, though the "minority community" is always disadvantaged in
such a situation, and this will inevitably be reflected in political
terms. Press reports indicated 103 "communal" incidents in 1966, 237
incidents in 1967, and an increasing number in 1968. The recent call for
the creation of an impartial, non-political commission to look into the
problem, by a number of respected academic and non-party political
figures, suggests that a serious situation does exist. Acharya
Kripalani, one of the persons making this appeal, has also called for a
National Coalition Government in the interests of unity, order, and
development. His credentials in the political life of the nation are
very great indeed.</P>

<P><A NAME="lang"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"
WIDTH="39" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A><B>The Language Question</B></P>

<P>Perhaps even more critical, in terms of the divisions it creates in
Indian society and the potential it has for divisiveness in politics, is
the question of language. There have been a number of state
re-organization schemes since independence which have essentially
reflected existing patterns of linguistic regionalism in the country.
With the partition of the Punjab in November, 1966, into the Punjabi
speaking and Hindispeaking states of Punjab and Haryana it seems that
this process has now run its course. This has been an entirely natural
process and there is some indication that with its conclusion linguistic
pressures will be relieved.</P>

<P>There is another dimension to the problem, however. This involves the
reactions of extremists to the adoption of Hindi,</P>

<P>++Page 37</P>

<P>spoken by 40 per cent of India's population, concentrated in the
north, as the official language of the country. In the South, Hindi is
considered culturally inferior and a symbol of northern dominance. In
December, 1967, Parliament passed a law preserving English as an
official national language until all states indicated their acceptance
of Hindi as the official language, which in practical terms meant in the
remote future, if ever. English, spoken by only 2 per cent of the
population by the chief means of official communication at the national
level and between the states, is viewed in the North as a foreign
language, and the December measure was widely and violently opposed in
the northern Hindi belt, particularly by the Jan Sangh and the Samyukta
(United) Socialist Party. (This apparent aberration on the part of a
socialist party indicates the non-ideological, practical appeal for
votes in traditional terms by India's most successful democratic
"socialist" party. This is what Weiner would call the appeal of the
"unsuccessful" Western-oriented party in the Indian context.) In the
attempt to quiet this opposition a resolution was adopted making English
optional for Hindi-speaking candidates of the civil service, and this
resolution in turn set off a bitter reaction in the South, where
non-Hindi, Dravidian languages are spoken. There were flag burnings,
student rioting, and demands for secession, from a small but vocal
English and a second Indian language, but in practical terms this
measure has little likelihood of success. The greatest hope for a
solution to the problem is that political parties, out of concern for
wider support beyond language regions, will restrain their opposition.
There is, in fact, some indication of this approach in the widening
efforts of the Jan Sangh, described above.</P>

<P>The Dravida Munnetra Kazagham (DMK), or Progressive Dravidian
Association, is now the most important of the regional parties with its
astonishing electoral victory in the South Indian state of Madras in the
1967 elections. The DMK's primary issue in the past has been the
cultural and</P>

<P>++Page 38<</P>

<P>political autonomy of the Dravidian South vis-a-vis the dominant
Hindi North. This argument has most often been expressed in anti-Hindi
pro-English (English is seen as a happy by-product of British rule
enabling India-wide communication) agitations, but it is perhaps
significant to note that as government this aspect of the platform has
been somewhat moderated, as it was indeed, even in certain respects
before the election. But that the election was won because of the South
vs. North anti-Hindi issue is clear. The force of these arguments can be
appreciated when it is understood that the Madras Congress government
had been one of the most effective in all of India.</P>

<P><A NAME="caste"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"
WIDTH="39" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A><B>The Effects of Caste</B></P>

<P>Another feature of Indian society that cuts across politics and
affects it as profoundly, if perhaps more subtly than language, is
caste. This is especially true in the local rural areas, in electoral
constituencies and in the political relationships found in many states.
It must also be understood that there is great variation from one part
of the country to another in terms of how caste operates. This depends
on a number of factors, including the size of caste groups, the ritual
and social distance between them and the dominance characteristics of
involved castes, and the conceived self and public images of politically
active caste groups and their history and degree of involvement in the
public life of their region.</P>

<P>Castes, or more accurately jatis, are highly localized kinship
groups. They are a basic social structural feature in Indian life, and
at the village level determine a man's economic role in society. In
social and ritual terms caste is rigidly hierarchical, relationships
between caste groups are precisely defined and are determined by a
person's birth as a member of a particular caste group. Theoretically,
one does not move outside the caste group in which one is born, though
there is mobility within the system as members of caste groups, and at
the local level entire caste groups adopt the characteristics of other
higher castes. For those of you who are familiar in</P>

<P>++Page 39</P>

<P>general terms with Indian society, we are not talking about the
four-fold <I>varna</I> system of caste in India. <I>Varna</I> is a
classical and theoretical formulation of four castes-priests, warriors,
merchants, and servants-which has only the most general relationship to
the thousands of endogamous <I>jati</I> groups we find in Indian society
today. For purposes of this paper any further detail, however important,
would be excessive.  There are in fact sub-castes and divisions within
them that are as important in political terms as the larger <I>jati</I>
units. But my point can be made without discussing the problem at that
level. The fact is that caste, defined as I have here, is perhaps the
most pervasive factor in Indian politics, though I do not mean to
suggest by this that it is the most important factor.</P>

<P>Because caste groups are relatively small, locally defined,
hierarchical social units, they are also well defined and identifiable
units for political purposes. In political terms, therefore, caste is a
basis for satisfying particular local interests and allegiances, but
because caste is by definition local or regional at most, and is
therefore not large enough to form meaningful political units apart from
other groups, it also becomes the basis for alliances and factional
political associations, much as ethnic groups elsewhere make alliances
within parties and seek balanced tickets to win elections and achieve
power. Let me emphasize what I have said above; that caste as a
political factor varies, the manner in which it operates in a political
situation, and the importance it has in that situation, varies from
locale to locale, from state to state. In some states, in fact, caste is
not a particularly significant consideration. In others it is critical.
In some states it has worked to the advantage of political groups and
parties, in others-Bihar in the north is a case in point-the
factionalizing process has served to break the Congress Party into
multiple feuding elements, apparently leading to its disintegration in
that state. I will examine the Bihar case in some detail in order to
identify more precisely the mechanics of caste as a political factor in
the Indian situation. In Bihar, in the traditional Hindu</P>

<P>++Page 40</P>

<P>heartland of north India, rural and socially conservative, caste
considerations have been as profound an influence in politics as
anywhere in India.</P>

<P><A NAME="bihar"></A>
<A HREF="#top"><IMG HEIGHT="20" ALT="Back to the top" SRC="top20.gif"
WIDTH="39" ALIGN="right" BORDER="0"></A><B>The Bihar Case</B></P>

<P>In this state of 53 million persons the basic social structural
components of family, lineage and caste are also the basic referents in
the competition for political power. The influence of a conservative
social order in Bihar politics took several forms, including the
organization of caste associations with social and political reform
objectives and the use of caste as an identification mechanism in the
political arena itself. A related and critical phenomenon that emerges
in these circumstances is the factionalizing of politics.</P>

<P>I would suggest that in the politics of twentieth century Bihar the
ritually higher and economically more powerful upper castes, as they are
identified in this state, took to higher education earlier, and
accordingly emerged info public life, the professions, administration
and politics earlier; and because of their social and economic power,
and despite their numerical weakness, they came to dominate politics,
and have confined to do so until very recently. Further, I am
suggesting, the upper castes were succeeded in this process of emergence
by the ritually lower, economically less well-off, less educated, but
numerically more extensive Backward Castes (this is an official Census
designation). These later emerging castes duplicated many of the
techniques and arguments in public life of the upper castes, but because
they were socially and economically disadvantaged they have been
politically disadvantaged. Because the factional process and the
franchise of the Independence era have given them leadership and votes
they are now playing an increasingly important political role.</P>

<P>Let me indicate now the mechanics of this traditionalized political
process in specific terms. With constitutional reforms following World
War I, Congress Party ministries coming to power, and a strong and
powerful party organization, a broad</P>

<P>++Page 41</P>

<P>range of seats, cabinets posts, organizational positions and other
offices became the objects of the competition for power in the 1920's
and especially in the 1930's. In other words, as the constitutional
changes and political reactions of the twentieth century provided
greater opportunities, the Kayasthas (scribes), Rajputs (landholders in
Bihar), and Bhumihar Brahmins (also landholders in Bihar), took
advantage of them in the traditional, parochial, caste terms of forming
associations, alliances among themselves, and pressing their candidates
info office. The character of this reaction was fortified by the fact
that all the participants were from the rural countryside, bringing with
them the values and modes of operation this implied. These developments
were true in the politics of the dominant Congress Party and all
political groups working within if, as most were. For example, in 1937
when the first Congress ministry under the Government of India Act of
1935 took office, Cabinet assignments were made primarily on the basis
of factional caste distribution. All the proper groups had to be taken
care of, and were. The position at that time broke down essentially info
major factions with Bhumihar Brahmins on the one hand and a combination
of Rajputs and Kayasthas, numerically a very small group, on the
other.</P>

<P>Independence in 1947 initiated a very fluid political process. The
Congress had come to power as a movement, but if had now to operate as a
party and the implications of this fact for the political competition we
are examining here are considerable. The Congress was no longer the
antigovernment agitator, if was the government, which had to rely on a
new mass voting base for support in carrying out complex programs of
development. The clientele making demands and giving support represented
all the traditional social and economic diversifies encountered in the
pre-Independence period. And these diversifies had in the nature of
things to be represented in the organization. At the same time, the
Congress as government came to control vast development and patronage
funds. The object of the competitive political game became more</P>

<P>++Page 42</P>

<P>attractive, and the participants became more numerous and came to
reflect in extreme form the caste-factional process apparent in 1937.
But from 1947 to the present the traditionalized political system of
Bihar has not been an arrangement of two factions in competition. In
response to the new operating conditions, it broke down into many
factions in which old caste lines became increasingly blurred as new
emerging castes and their leaders were courted for the mass base they
represented and the group support they could offer. This meant new
leaders contending for the allegiance of new groups or aligning
themselves with existing groups. There was a proliferation of groups in
this process to the point where identification of groups became
difficult and definition of group membership impossible. In Bihar
coalitions shift to achieve power and in doing so seek or give support
across caste lines. Caste is the means by which positions of power are
strengthened. When an alliance does not achieve this objective it is
ended for more favorable alliances.</P>

<P>It becomes apparent that in Bihar caste factions in politics seek
support where they can get it. The fact that there are more sources for
such support, representing increasingly important social and economic
interest groups, means that there are more factions which divide, shift
and reform to seek their greatest advantage. The price of support
extended by a group or faction is power or political influence. I refer
again to the similarity between this situation and ethnic group politics
in the United States.</P>

<P>From what I have been saying it can be seen that the traditional
elements of society are influenced by the political system, in that they
operate within it, and in turn influence the process by which the system
itself operates. The traditional society moves in the direction of
modernization and the political system becomes traditionalized. In Bihar
it is this latter part of the process that is most significant.</P>

<P>A brief description of how it involves the larger Backward and
Scheduled (Untouchable) Castes will conclude my remarks on caste in
politics. These numerically extensive caste groups have become a very
basic component in the dynamics of political competition in recent years
and now have moved into a central position. Until recently neither the
Backward nor the Scheduled Caste groups determined leadership elections
or other major political results. This was true because, as I have
indicated, the process of emergence of a caste into public and political
life occurs over time, and as the factionalized upper caste groups have
competitively sought support in the large, newly emergent castes, there
have appeared multiple leaders and groups within individual castes
attracted by the prospect of position and influence such associations
might bring to an individual leader and to his caste. Accordingly no
bloc of caste groups artificially categorized Backward will be cohesive
in politics because of the vast numbers and the wide range of economic
and social interests involved.</P>

<P>The pressure for reform, education, caste improvement and the removal
of the disadvantages of Backwardness and "Untouchableness" as well as
the political factors already indicated, have provided these groups with
an identity and a consciousness of growing strength and political power.
What seems probable in the highly fluid political situation of 1968 is
that the numerically extensive Backward and Scheduled Caste groups, or
more accurately, elements within them, with an increasingly literate
mass base and a more well-educated and experienced leadership, will come
to play an increasingly important role, whether in or out of the
Congress-probably both. They will associate in positions of power more
consistently with the upper castes, or they will exercise it
independently. This prospect was anticipated as early as 1964 when one
of the leading Bhumihar Brahmin politicians indicated that his fear for
the future was not from the other upper castes but from the rising and
numerically dominant Back-</P>

<P>ward and Scheduled Castes. Caste in this respect takes on the
complexion of class.</P>

<P>However, it should be noted, significantly, that the first Scheduled
Caste chief minister in Bihar's history, Bhola Paswan Shastri, was sworn
in as the head of a non-Congress coalition government, with the support
of virtually all non-Congress parties representing all caste groups in
the state. Indeed, the first minister he appointed to his cabinet was a
Bhumihar Brahmin. The chief minister and most of his cabinet members are
themselves dissident, i.e., defecting, Congressmen.</P>

<P>The situation is one of great flux and all we can say at this point
is that the traditionalizing of the political system in the state of
Bihar has led to a factionalizing process and a fractionalizing of
Congress Party leadership, where personal and group interests for power
became in themselves the object. The party machinery could not sustain
this shifting divisiveness, nor could it govern and manage the program
of development. The result has been the defeat of the Party at the polls
and its apparent fragmentation. Whether other groups will be able to
operate differently in these circumstances cannot be said. There may be
a period of instability of coalition governments leading ultimately to
President's Rule. Again whether parties like the Jan Sangh, who are
increasingly active in Bihar and who are coincidentally supporting the
new government, can benefit by the present situation, is also not yet
clear.  The situation is simply too complex and there are too many
intangibles involved to permit conjecture.</P>

<P>Tribal distinction, economic distinction, the distinction between the
educated elite and the mass of India's villagers are all factors in
Indian politics I have not touched, just as I have not touched on the
importance of landholding, moneylending, education, social service, and
the personal element, in my consideration of Indian politics. These
factors are all important, perhaps in different ways than religion,
language and caste, which I have used to make my points in this paper.
To repeat, insofar as language, religion and caste reflect the basic,
ele-</P>

<P>++Page 45</P>

<P>mentary traditional beliefs of a conservative, rural society, I
maintain that they Indianize politics in the same traditional,
conservative terms understood by the peasant population. In this sense
the failures of the present parties in government will benefit parties
that make traditional social and cultural appeals. The Congress machine
has been hurt by its inability to perform in certain development
situations, and it has been hurt in some places by exploiting certain
traditional features of the society-caste too narrowly and to the
disadvantage of the broader party interests. I have suggested that the
parties that will benefit are essentially those who exploit other
traditional sentiments, language and especially religion, and who are on
the communal right.</P>

<P>I also pointed out at the beginning that to the extent that
unfulfilled needs led to political instability, frustration, agitation
and violence, these traditional, conservative tendencies will be
fortified in the cities and in the countryside in the direction of
right, authoritarian, nationalistic groups. Such sentiments are very
much a part of the Indian experience. The autocratic ruler is the
central figure in Indian history, in the Hindu and in the Muslim and
Mughal dynasties and in the princely states that ruled much of India to
the time of independence in 1947. My colleague Professor H. S. Plunkett,
describes political meetings in present-day Rajasthan as they relate to
politics and governmental processes. He describes these as secular
cultural performances revolving around the concept of the darbar, a term
which implies the government of the traditional state, the periodic
public gatherings with much pomp and circumstance which symbolized the
administration and the court in general, and the person of the ruler in
particular. The autocratic conception then is still very much alive. And
the British, for all the constitutional reform they introduced, were in
the most basic sense authoritarian, and the administrators of their rule
in the districts, the district officers, were certainly that.
Morris-Jones refers tellingly and appropriately it seems to Nehru, as
"King in Parliament".<A NAME="rf07"></A> <A

<B>Moves Toward Violence</B></P>

<P>I detect a feeling of unrest in India that moves often in the
direction of violence, which is also part of the Indian tradition,
culturally and historically. <I>Danda</I> (force) is as important a
concept in India as <I>ahimsa</I> (non-violence). There is the tradition
of mass agitation against an alien government, which has now spilled
over into aimless attacks on public property, buses, trains, schools,
and the police.  Nirad Chaudhri would call this the Indian tradition of
anarchy, which is probably correct. There is little of a planned nature
in the violence that erupts, by and large little ideological motivation
involved, though the parties step in to take advantage of situations
that arise.  Certainly there is no single cause or pattern to what
happens. It involves students, peasants, laborers in urban centers, and
many others, and has elicited sharp reactions from police and
government. In one such riot situation which I observed in 1965 in
Patna, a city of 500,000, an increase in student school fees and a
difficult food price situation provided the occasion for a mass
demonstration, which then escalated into violence, was joined by
dissatisfied petty government clerks, and as a mob riot, assumed a life
of its own, and burned the railway station, food warehouses, and which
then petered out locally, but spread throughout the state. I judge that
there is a resentment and dissatisfaction with administrative
inefficiencies and corruptions, an impatience with things as they are
compared with expectations, a general sense of confusion and
frustration. I see in this little ideological motive, as I have
indicated, but the extremes of the left and right will not, I suspect,
let the opportunities pass. Violence in Indian life and politics and the
authoritarian strain and its influences in Indian life are problems
which require the scrutiny of the political scientist and the cultural
anthropologist. They are serious factors in the tradition we need to
know more about.</P>

<P>The recent successes (March, 1968) of the neo-Fascist Shiv Sena in
capturing nearly one-third of the Bombay City Council seats and ousting
the Congress from power indicate </P>

<P>++Page 47</P>

<P>the tendencies of these sentiments in hard terms. Taking its name
from a seventeenth century Maratha warrior who fought the Muslim
Mughals, the party has now become a major force in the important western
state of Maharashtra. The party's spokesman is Bal Thackeray, a
cartoonist, whose appeal is narrowly economic. In a city where
two-thirds of the jobs are held by outsiders, primarily South Indians,
he insists that 80 per cent of all jobs must be filled by
Maharashtrians. This is a powerful appeal in working class districts
where unemployment is high, and Thackeray's anti-unionism and
anti-communism have also attracted substantial support from Bombay
businessmen. The success of the frankly authoritarian and violent Shiv
Sena, while regional in character, suggests a tendency in the political
life of the nation which cannot be ignored.</P>

<P>We come back to where we started, the problem of unity and diversity
in Indian society, and the encounter of modernity with tradition. We
have spoken of many stabilizing factors in Indian society. Mason
appropriately adds to this the broad, eclectic, and tolerant aspects of
the Hindu cultural tradition, the unifying effect of Hindu values that
pervade Indian society: This suggests that in any complex society there
are elements of diversity in a broader framework of unity. But while
some elements of social division affect politics and the stability of
the state, and other elements of tolerance and accommodation common both
to the political system and the Hindu tradition have a stabilizing
effect, ultimately the political stability of India as a nation will
depend on the responsiveness of its political leaders in government,
whatever their party, to the problems of nation-building, and
specifically to India's most critical problem, the feeding of its
growing population.</P>
