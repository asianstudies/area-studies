<hr>
 
Few books in recent years have come to grips so powerfully
or convincingly with what is certainly one of the central issues
confronting the Indian state as does India Against Itself. This
is a book about Assam and the Northeast but it is at the same
time a compelling examination of the very nature of the federal
polity or, as the Constitution defines it, the Union of India.
Sanjib Baruah is concerned about the "tame commitment" of
the constitution-makers to a full concept of federalism, and
more so with the emergence of an all-powerful Centre in the
52 years of post-colonial independent India. It is the policies
that have emerged from this pan-Indian political equation and
how they have disturbed the lives and liberties of the several
subnationalisms of the nation that Baruah examines so
effectively in these pages. As his chapter titles show, Baruah is
as concerned with the colonial antecedents of the problem and
its transformations since 1947 as he is with its contemporary
manifestations on the eve of the 21st century. His chapter titles
speak for themselves: Theoretical Considerations: The Limits
of "Nation Building"; Colonial Geography as Destiny: Assam
as a Province of British India; The Making of a Land Frontier:
Assam and Its Immigrants; Cultural Politics of Language,
Subnationalism, and Pan-Indianism; Contested Identity,
Culture Wars, and the Breakup of Colonial Assam; Protest
Against Immigration, Ethnic Rifts, and Assam's Crisis of
Governability; Militant Subnationalism, Human Rights, and the
Chasm with Pan-Indianism; "We Are Bodos, Not Assamese":
Contesting a Subnational Narrative; Conclusion: India Against
Itself. <p>

Baruah, himself Assamese, or "ethnic Assamese" as he was
surprised to learn from an interlocutor in his home state,
comes to his inquiry from the perspective of the political
scientist. He chairs his department at Bard College in the
United States. But at the same time he brings to bear on his
analysis a rich historical sensibility which makes of this small
volume in the Pennsylvania Critical Histories Series a model of
cross-disciplinary scholarship. It is a book that defines the
issues and the crises of governability they pose, but which is
not without hope of the possibilities for change. In an essay so
well-written as this one, I can do no better than to quote
Baruah himself on the argument he makes: "A radically
reformed federalism," he suggests, "would at least have [had]
the potential for some day developing a more effective politics
of accountability and of better accommodating the logic of
subnationalism within a pan-Indian polity." It is an argument
the author elaborates for the Northeast, and specifically
Assam, but with the clear implication that while the terms of
engagement may vary, the logic applies with equal meaning to
other regionalisms, including those of Punjab and Kashmir. <p>

Reformed federalism for Baruah would soften the "big
brother" role of the Central government and create space for
a more autonomous state-level political arena, for example
with respect to immigration and enfranchisement, issues of
culture and vis a vis development policy and control over
resources. <p>

In the important matter of development Baruah cites Assam's
former commissioner of planning and development to make
his point, showing that the major beneficiaries of the increase
of Central development funds in the northeastern states have
been a group of contractors and license holders -- mostly
from outside the region -- whose "main ambition is to make a
fast buck and get out of the area as quickly as possible." <p>

Then as development funds are increased in response to rising
subnational discontent, there is an enhanced siphoning off of
these funds, and worse, local officials are seen to be in league
with the adventurer-entrepreneurs. Baruah's point is not that a
radical federalism would resolve this debilitating crisis; but that
it would introduce a politics of accountability and at least
begin to move in the direction of change.<p> 

Written well before the just-concluded 13th general elections,
Baruah nevertheless anticipates more than a glimmer of hope
in what can best be described as the pluralizing of politics in
the multi-ethnic social and cultural environment that is India.
The large number of regional, or subnational political parties,
to use Baruah's term, and the coalition governments of which
they have become a part, effectively five times between 1977
and the multi- party, Bharatiya Janata Party-led National
Democratic Alliance government sworn in on October 13,
1999, make the point well. <p>

This recent history suggests that coalition politics is not a
passing phase, and apart from the moderating influences it
may bring to bear on the ideological disposition of the BJP,
the expectation is that it may also serve to moderate the policy
influences of the all-powerful Indian state in its dealings with
the regional, or subnational components of the Indian Union. <p>

Baruah begs for such an inclusionary politics of
accommodation in this thoughtful consideration of how the
Indian polity functions and how it might improve on the
process. I conclude with Baruah's own conclusion: "Those at
the helm of the Indian State, I hope, will be able to distance
themselves from the derivative, suffocating, and quite
out-of-date paradigm of nation-building and return to a more
confident vision of the civilizational unity of the subcontinent. <p>

It is only such self-confidence that can enable India to launch a
bold project of genuine federation-building, which ultimately is
the only way to bring subnationalism and pan-Indianism closer
together." It is a hope and optimism many will share. <p>
