One of Richard Nixon's more memorable lines in the last days of
his flawed presidency was his assurance to the American people
that he was "not a crook". This public denial almost certainly
convinced most Americans that indeed he was a crook, to use his
graphic language; and his resignation in 1974 under certain
threat of impeachment,seemed to confirm the fact.  The Nixon
experience of the early Seventies resonates in many remarkable
ways with the travail of Laloo Prasad Yadav in 1997, not the
least in Yadav's assurance that he too was "not a <i>chor</i>"  -  at
least, so he believed, in the eyes of the people of Bihar.

<b>Laloo Prasad Yadav and Richard Nixon: <br>unfortunate hand 
me downs</b></center></a>
The
chief minister's appeal to the people is noteworthy, for in the
ultimate analysis, much like Nixon, Yadav's political fate and
future will be determined in the court of the people and the
democratic institutions by which they have chosen to govern
themselves. And one hastens to add that this will be the jana
adalat of the polling booth and the formally constituted courts
of law, and not the <i>maharailla</i> of populist politics, however
legitimate an instrumentality of the democratic process the
street rally and <i>bandh</i> may be in a free and open society. <p>

The Nixon-Laloo coincidence is particularly pointed in mid-1997
because June 17, the day Bihar's governor, A.R. Kidwai,sanctioned
the chargesheeting of Yadav in the fodder scandal case, was also
the 25th anniversary to the day of the notorious break in at the
Watergate headquarters of the democratic national committee in
Washington. It was this bungled piece of political espionage
which set in motion the constitutional crisis resulting in
Nixon's resignation from the presidency in 1974. It was a unique
event in American political history.<p>

Nixon's paranoia about his political"enemies", as he viewed them,
had led him to engage in political "dirty tricks" long before.
But the fallout from the Watergate caper, involving both the
Nixon White House and the Republican national committee, led,
over the course of two years, to a charge of obstructing justice,
with the ultimate involvement of the Supreme Court and his
assured impeachment by the United States house of
representatives. It was in the end an episode of the egregious
abuse of power at the highest levels of government.<p>

Without carrying the Laloo-Nixon comparison too far, one need 
only cite the reports in the newspapers of June 24, on the
chargesheeting of the chief minister and 55 others, to make the
point about the abuse and misuse of power in the present
instance. The accused in the fodder scandal case No. RC 20(A)/96
have been charged with forgery, conspiracy, criminal breach of
trust, and falsification of accounts. The details of the case
have dominated the national and regional press for far too long
to require repeating here.  It should be noted, however, that
while the current case involves a mere Rs 370 million withdrawn
from the Chaibasa treasury between 1994-95 against false bills
and supply orders, the scandal totals�most of which are
attributable to the years after 1990 and the time when Yadav was
chief minister and also holding charge of finance�are estimated
at between Rs 9.5 billion to Rs 15 billion. <p> 

That the chargesheeting of the chief minister should happen only
days before the June 25 anniversary of Indira Gandhi's Emergency
is an additional irony to a year of ironies in the life of Yadav.
In January 1996, when the fodder scandal first came into public
view outside of Bihar, Yadav was named president of the Janata
Dal, to replace the then <i>hawala</i> tainted S.R. Bommai. In April and
May 1996, Yadav was projected and projected himself as the
potential prime minister, an exercise which was repeated by Yadav
and his supporters among the political classes with the demise of
the H.D. Deve Gowda government in April of this year. <p> 

In the meantime, of course, the citizen voters of Bihar had
already begun making their rather more sensitive judgments at the
polling place. In 1996, they reduced the Janata Dal Lok Sabha
representation from 32 to 22, or if one includes the National
Front-Left Front allies in 1991, from 48 seats effectively
controlled by Yadav to the present 22.  That pattern of voter
reaction to the Yadav's Janata Dal was confirmed in the October
1996 byelections when the Janata Dal lost four of 10 assembly
seats - all of which it had previously held - to the Samata
Party-Bhharatiya Janata party combine.  However one reads these
results, the citizen voters of Bihar appeared on the electoral
surface to be sending a message much more powerful than the
contrived publicity of <i>maharaillas</i>, <i>bandh</i>s, and promises of
subsidized <i>saris</i> and <i>dhotis</i> which have dominated the daily press
in recent months. <p>

The irony of the Emergency connection is that Yadav appears to be
neither aware of nor concerned with the abuse of power in 1997,
an issue which confronted him very directly in the mid-Seventies.
It will be recalled that Yadav, who with his contemporaries,
Sushil Kumar Modi and Nitish Kumar, experienced his political
baptism by fire in the student and anti-corruption movement of
Jayaprakash Narayan in 1974, was, together with many others, a
victim of the Emergency.<p>  

Indeed, Yadav much like Nixon, and certainly like Indira Gandhi
has come to believe in his own indispensability. And like Nixon,
he is fully convinced that he is victim of a grand conspiracy
wherein everyone who is not his supporter, is inevitably his
enemy. This paranoia cost Nixon his presidency as it will almost
certainly cost Yadav the chief ministership. And in the Indian
case there is the additional burden that Yadav's obdurate
resistance to all norms of civil democratic responsibility may
well split the Janata Dal he has done so much to strengthen over
the years.<p>  

It is of course far too early to write Yadav's political
obituary.  He remains a powerful player both in Bihar and in New
Delhi and his actions will do much to determine the course of
events in both places. But it is not too early to draw meaning
from the fodder scandal episode and the chargesheeting of the
first sitting chief minister in India's history as a democratic
republic.<p>  

The retrospectives in the US 25 years after Watergate provide a
number of interesting ideas that are at least as relevant to the
Indian case as they are to the American. Most prominent of these
reflections is that Watergate and the Nixon resignation showed
clearly that the system works. The nation was traumatized by
Vietnam, and Watergate added to this climate of cynicism and
anger about the way things were. But though Nixon was reelected
to a second term, and the legal and political processes leading
to his certain impeachment and resignation took more than two
years to work themselves out, he did in the end resign. His vice
presidential successor was defeated by a massive anti-Washington
mandate, and Jimmy Carter the low key governor of Georgia, was
elected president in 1976.<p>  

So too in India the process may seen to be overlong and drawn
out. But that is, of course, precisely what the authors of the
Constitution intended. It is certain that the fodder scandal will
spend much time in the courts in the months and probably years
ahead. And Yadav will indeed have his day in court to prove his
innocence. And the warning of the special judge in the case that
the Central Bureau of Investigation must follow all legal
procedures, assures the chief minister of a fair hearing. In the
meantime, whatever the immediate political future holds for
Bihar, the Janata Dal, and the United Front at the Centre, it is
certain that the people of Bihar and of India will have the final
word, whenever that may happen, at the polls. <p> 

I have said before that the democratic system, whether in the US
or India, may be flawed, but it works. The US survived Watergate
and the assumption is that in 1997 it will survive the campaign
finance scandals a notoriously weak federal election commission
seems incapable of comprehending, leave alone resolving. Nor do
politicians of either party show the interest or political will
to enact meaning reform.<p>  

So too in India multiple scandals dominate politics and the news
on an almost daily basis while the political classes do little
more than wring their hands in apparent dismay. On the other
hand, public interest litigations and the courts have forced the
fodder scandal to its current resolution, and a powerful Election
Commission monitors internal party elections, apart from
regulating an electoral experience at the state and national
level over 50 years that is unique on the planet. <p> 

While the chargesheeting of a chief minister apparently consumes
the political life of the nation, life goes on. India will elect
its constitutional head of state on July 14, and on July 25, K.R.
Narayanan will be sworn in as India's 11th president. To repeat,
the system is not flawless, but at its best the democratic
process has the built in mechanisms to make necessary changes. It
is an image that keeps hope alive wherever democracy is firmly
rooted.  India is such a place.<p>
