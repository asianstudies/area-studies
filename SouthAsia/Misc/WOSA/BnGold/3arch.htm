     A new Woodstock School Archive is rapidly taking shape above
the administrative offices at the far end of the Quadrangle.<p>

     The Archive is being established as a project of the Class
of l942.<p>

     Renovation of the two-room suite began during the winter
vacation. The rooms are immediately adjacent to the
Development/Alumni office and will be entered from that area.
Most of the basic work is done and workers are now installing
wiring, lights, window frames and doors.<p>

     The outer room will be about 10 meters by 10 meters, with a
window that looks out the back of the school toward the hills to
the east. It will have space for some storage and also for some
display cases. A prominent feature of the room will he the large
desk that once belonged to Miss Vera Marley.<p>

     The second room in the suite will be somewhat smaller and is
designed not for appearances but for security. It will be
windowless with smooth, hard finishes on the floor and walls to
reduce dust and to enable climate and humidity to be controlled
more easily.<p>

     This second room will be devoted to filing cabinets and
storage and will be a place where historical material can be
stored with a minimum of traffic. Material can be retrieved from 
this room and moved into the outer room for examination and
use by researchers.<p>

     WOSA-North America, in cooperation with the class of '42,
has established an Archives Committee to advise on equipping and
use of the Archive once the physical structure is completed this
summer.<p>

     The Archive Committee is being headed by Margo Warner Curl
('67).<p>
