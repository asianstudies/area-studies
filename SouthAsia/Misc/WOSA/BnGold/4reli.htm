     Last semester, <i>The Tiger </i>published an editorial on how
Diwali was neglected in Woodstock.  Since then, Dr. Barton, Mr.
Wilkins and other staff have taken extra measures to ensure that
high school students were made aware of Holi [and other religious
holidays of India. I Mr. Wilkins plans to initiate comparative
religious studies in Middle School. Dr. Barton and Mr. Wilkins
agree that students should be allowed to celebrate their
festivals and if necessary, go to the temple, mosque or
monastery. Mr. Wilkins feels that "we should enter into each
other's religious views with imagination, empathy and
sensitivity. <p>
     Over the years, students have been quick to label Woodstock
as an intolerant and strictly Christian school, where staff
members are insensitive to others' religions. But this accusation
is neither true nor just. The school is deemed as a Christian
international school, and this is made clear to all those who
apply to study here. Woodstock's philosophy is to base the school
on Christian teaching and principles, but it does allow enough
space for students from other faiths to practice their religion.
It is just a question of how those of us who are
non-Christians choose to use the freedom granted to us.<p>

     Dr. Barton recalls that when he first came to Woodstock,
there was compulsory chapel for all students every week. The
Muslim girls didn't visit the mosque on Id until 1992, when one
of them showed interest and they were allowed to go. In recent
times, things have changed a great deal and students of all
religions have an opportunity to visit their places of worship if
a proposal is handed to the administration in advance.<p>

     Many non-Christian students find prejudice where there is a
holiday for Good Friday and not one for Id, Diwali, or Losar.  
What we do have to keep in mind is that this is a Christian
school, so it is only fair that school is shut on a major
Christian holiday. Nevertheless, the administration should
consider either shortening the periods or giving a half day off
for one major festival of each religion represented at Woodstock.<p>

     On behalf of Hindu, Buddhists, Muslim students and anyone
else who shares our view, we thank and congratulate the school
for being sensitive and allowing people of all persuasions the
time to celebrate their festivals the way they want. <p>

Ajit Sherring ('89), running the anchor leg for the WOSA team,
storms to a second place finish in the 100 meter open relay on
Sports Day. Atul Datta ('90), Tom Alter ('68) and Jonnie Mendies
('95) ran the first three legs. WOSA members should note that
Devina Anand ('77) finished second in the sack race, but was
competing as a parent rather than an old student. <p>
