Ajit Sherring ('89), running the anchor leg for the WOSA team,
storms to a second place finish in the 100 meter open relay on
Sports Day. Atul Datta ('90), Tom Alter ('68) and Jonnie Mendies
('95) ran the first three legs. WOSA members should note that
Devina Anand ('77) finished second in the sack race, but was
competing as a parent rather than an old student. <p>
