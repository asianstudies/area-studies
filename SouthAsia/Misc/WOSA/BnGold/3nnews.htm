     Former and present music students will be shocked to learn
that Diana Biswas was seen visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of
Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, this winter, in company of Betty Bob and
Jane Pendley. And she enjoyed it. Mrs Biswas, we understand Bach
and Mendelssohn, but Elvis?<p>

     A consultant who visited last fall doing a survey of
international schools in India was heard telling High School Dean
James Baron that Woodstock's computer facilities were the best
she had seen in India, bar none. She specifically included the
American Embassy School in Delhi.<p>

     A modern video editing system is now available to Woodstock
students. The new equipment, purchased with funds from the
American School and Hospital Abroad program, is in the tender
care of Drama/Journalism teacher Tom Kidder.  He's just signed up
for a new hitch at Woodstock, though he isn't saying whether his
fancy new toys had anything to do with that decision.<p>

     Science teacher Abha Singh will spend next semester at
Kodaikanal School in Tamil Nadu helping them set up a Middle
School science lab. She was the guiding light behind Woodstock's
new /ate, and as a/ways we are happy to see someone from
Woodstock showing Kodai the ropes.<p>

     A new dart board has appeared in the High School staff f
lounge with the following note below it: "This modest
recreational device is presented to Woodstock's high school staff
and administrators in sincere appreciation for their selfless
dedication and hard work, and in the fond hope that they may find
a moment or two to relax in the course of each busy day, In
appreciation, The Woodstock Old Students Assn. - India "<p>

     Kenneth Waldock, the present "burping king" of Hostel, faced
harsh competition during a recent contest, says The Tiger. 
Allegedly, David Mendies organized a competition between Kenneth
and a bull during Activity Week. The Tiger reports Kenneth was
defeated, though no details were given. However the contest was
later ruled unfair and Kenneth is still the reigning `burping
king' in Hostel."<p>

Excerpted from <i>The Tiger</i><p>

     The last week of February, Woodstock was faced with a crisis
[when] employees went on strike. <p>
     Woodstock weathered the crisis because of the cooperation
between students and staff members, which kept everything
running. Things returned to normal as the employees returned to
work on the evening of February 28 [after a strike of three
days.]<p>
     "We always have a way of pulling together to do what has to
tee done," said Rev. Flaming.
     According to Rev. Flaming, inquiries by local police led to
allegations of mistreatment of a kitchen employee. This sparked 
off protest among bearerjis and the maintenance crew [who felt
the school had not adequately intervened to protect them from the
alleged brutality ]<p>
     The goal of the strike was to make sure the school
understood the problem the employees faced. They wanted some
assurance that they were to be protected <p>
     With the Uttarkhand crisis as a catalyzing agent, "falling
into a serious confrontation' was one of Rev, Flaming's concerns.<p>
     A delegation of employees executed informal negotiations
that led to settlement of the issue after expressions of regret,
and a commitment that incident would be investigated.]<p>

<b>An editorial by Tina Thomas<br>
Excerpted from The Tiger</b><p>

     We need each other. Living in a small community brings
everyone closer, whether it is the staff, students or employees,
We are a body that cannot function without its vital parts. <p>  
     The employees play a big role in our community, When the
employees went on strike, everyone realized their importance, not
just as employees, but as people. We recognized their dedication
and the responsibility they feel toward the students, Before the
employees went on strike they served the students breakfast.<p>
     During the strike, one of their greatest concerns was for
our welfare, "We were very worried about the children," said one
bearerji.<p>
     It was incredible how the students responded to this
situation, They were cooperative end extremely helpful. They
really liked the idea of missing a couple of classes to help with
meals, The students worked as a team. "You all did very well,~'
said one bearerji.<p>
     The incident made the students realize the importance of
employees to the school. We realized how much employees have to
do to meet our needs. When we had the task of cleaning up, it was
not easy.<p>
     Everyone was thrilled when the employees returned. Students
hugged them with warm welcomes. <p> 
     Everyone learned from this situation, Now that we are aware
of the work the employees do, we should show our appreciation by
being respectful and sensitive to them. We ought to make efforts
to be polite while taking our meals.  We should also help by not
littering. Let us not forget the lessons we learned.
