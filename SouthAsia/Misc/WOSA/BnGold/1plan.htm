toward the 21st Century
</b></font></center>
<hr>
     A long-range plan describing directions for Woodstock School
through the year 2009 is currently the final phases of drafting.<p>
     The plan has been in the works for several years, and was
forwarded to the Executive Committee of the Board early this
year.  The Executive Committee approved the plan at its meeting
in April, and the 50-page document was to be on the agenda of the
full Board in mid-May.<p>
     The introduction of the plan points out that during the
first decade of the 21st Century, Woodstock will celebrate 150
years in existence and, in 2009, the 50th year since it became the first
high school in Asia accredited by the Middle States Association
of Collages and Secondary Schools.<p>
     The text goes on to say that "Woodstock intends to mark
these anniversaries by consolidating its credentials as a school
of international distinction in South Asia."<p>
     The document is entitled "Service Through Excellence: A
Long-Range Plan for Woodstock School Through The Year 2009."<p>
       The document describes a series of tangible affirmations,
actions, and coordinated steps intended to accomplish five goals:<p>
 <blockquote>     
         - Strengthen and consolidate the staff.<br>
         - Energize the academic program.<br>
         - Focus on student identity and needs.<br>
         - Respond to physical plant requirements.<br>
         - Communicate more clearly about Woodstock in its Indian
context.</blockquote>
      
     Among the more noteworthy features of the plan are:<p>
<ul>
<li>    A projected staff strength of 105-110, with about half
national and half foreign.
 <li>    Efforts to stimulate the interest of the best staff in
India in serving at Woodstock, and a more active approach to
staff recruitment.
<li>     Maintaining academic excellence as the touchstone of the
Woodstock program, but also exploring opportunities to serve as a
center for innovation in international education, and clarifying
the advantage represented by our mountain location by assembling
an outdoor education program.
<li>     Developing programs, classes and linkages which relate
Woodstock more clearly and firmly with our local and national
context.
<li>     Expanding the student body by 50-75 students, with a focus
on
 <ul><li>       a) Indian and foreign students whose families must
function in an international context, or who need peculiarly
international outlook,
 <li>        b) Christian families and Christian workers, and
  <li>       c) India's "nation builders," meaning families committed
to the growth and development of India in the best sense, people
who have chosen to forego the lure of financial success and
instead to be involved in the service of others.
</ul>
<li>     Seeking a student body that reflects national as well as
international diversity.
 <li>    Finding funds to pursue an ambitious building and
renovation program that would include a new science wing, an
improved high school girls' residence, a dormitory to house young
students, and indoor gymnasium, and an environmental learning
center.
  <li>   Planning for increased self-sufficiency in water supply.
<li>     Actively advancing the message that Woodstock is an
institution providing enormous benefit to India, seeking
consonance and harmony with its Indian context, and regarding
Indian history, culture and tradition as part of its immutable
identity along with its physical location in India.
<li>     Developing statements interpreting the school's religious
identity, context and behavior, and identifying appropriate ways
to deal with its identity as a minority institution.
 <li>    Making a more concerted effort to orient foreign staff to
the religious and social context of India.
<li>     Building endowment and scholarship funds.
</ul>
     A synopsis of the plan summarizes the entire intention in
two lengthy but "meaty" paragraphs:<p>
     "Woodstock intends to pursue these goals without sacrificing
the elements that make the School such a unique place. It is this
very mix which provides the foundation.  Woodstock affirms and
will strengthen the international  character which gives it such
unusual vibrancy and vitality.  Woodstock will preserve its
identity as a community with an unapologetic motivation rooted in
the teachings of Jesus Christ, coupled always with an affirmation
of the value of the pilgrimages of those of other faiths.
Woodstock will strive to provide an education marked by academic
excellence, and a caring and supportive environment for its
residential students.  Woodstock will be more intentional in its
commitment to being an international school in an Indian setting
in the Himalayan Mountains.<p>
     "The closing phrase of <a href="../Songs/creed.htm">
the Woodstock School Creed</a>, adopted
in the early part of the century now drawing to a close, exhorts
members of our community to 'transmit this School greater, better
and more beautiful than it was transmitted to us.'  The
intentions of this plan lie within that spirit of continued
striving toward the elusive goal of excellence."<p>
