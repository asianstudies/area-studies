     I have just been initiated into the world of CD ROM's. Before I
stepped into the library computer room, I pretty much knew zilch
about this whole program.  I knew only that you could hear music and
watch video clips. Sounded like my kind of studying. I desperately
needed to get enlightened so I could find what the big hoo-hah
about the JFK assassination program was all about.<p>
     When I finally got past the crowd and grabbed a computer,
someone was glued to the JFK CD, so I decided to try out
Microsoft Encarta '95. <p>
     As I opened the program, I could hear music and voices on the
headphones. An introduction appeared. There was a choice of nine
areas of interest, ranging from Physical Science and Technology to
Sports, Hobbies and Pets. Performing Arts seemed like a good place
to start.<p>
     From the category of Performing Arts, I chose Music. A box
appeared with a whole list of kinds of music. I like rock. By
clicking on it, the description and history of rock and a small
screen appeared. A symbol for audio with singers' names was on the 
top. I was in the mood for some David Bowie, and there he was on
the screen. I pressed "play" at the bottom of the screen and
before I knew it, I was grooving to one of his old hits.<p>
     Life Science sounded pretty boring, but I decided to give it
it a try as my next area of interest. I got into Anatomy and
Physiology and found out some pretty interesting facts. Did you now
that a human excretes 100 billion bacteria a day? <p>
     This program also has a timeline. Type in a year and find out
all the historic events of that time. It also has a "place" box.
Type in the name of a place and <i>voila</i>, all the facts about the
place are in front of your face. There is a media section which
shows you clippings if what you were looking up was ever in the
news. <p>
     I walked out of the computer room feeling exhilarated.  I
didn't get to watch the JFK assassination, but I knew my way around
on CD ROM program, and Microsoft Encarta '95 is sure going to be
useful to me when I get new assignments on any subject.

<h2><a name="comp">Computer library expands again</a></h2>

     The American Schools and Hospitals Abroad (ASHA) grant
continues to fund new computer software for Woodstock School's
multi-media library. <p>
     In addition to a basic computer information retrieval system,
our CD-Rom collection is growing, both in size and popularity. <p>
     A Woodstock high school student can now look up social issues
in our SlRS-Social Issues Researcher.<p>
     There are several thousand current newspaper and magazine
articles on CD-Rom, updated quarterly.<p>
     Our high school students can use the new Shakespeare Romeo
& Gallate CD-Rom with multiple video clips from performances,
along with lots of literary information. The Shakespeare class
members already used it in their classroom by rolling in a computer
on one our new moveable carts. <p>
     The Lcssen-German language CD Rom is being used by the German
language students, and math students are learning fiom Geometric
Sketchpad.<p>
     Expan Guidance package for colleges is a very popular package
among students researching their college choice.
