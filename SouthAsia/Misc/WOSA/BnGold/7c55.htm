Librarian Margaret McDonald is in high gear these days, thanks in
part to some timely support from the Class of 1956. Woodstock
School would like to express its thanks to the class for donating
a computer for use of the High School library. The gift was made
in fond memory of Miss Vera Msrley who worked at Woodstock for so
many years. Members of the class made the gift during a reunion
held in Mussoorie last year.<p>

     Woodstock offers several opportunities for student exchanges.   
Criteria for selection include grade level, academic standing, 
community conributions, an essay, and an interview.<p>

     One cxchange is with Carey Bnptist Grammar School, near
Melbourne, Australia. It is known as one Australia's finest
schools. <p>

     Another is with Meiji Gakuin in Tokyo. Exchange students
live with host families and share fully in their lives,
including food, family customs, and other activities.
