</b></font></center>
<hr>

     A proposal to raise 10 1akhs for a scholarship for children 
of alumni has been endorsed by WOSA-India. The endorsement came
at a February meeting of the WOSA Council. The plan was proposed
by Tensingh Nema ('80), who personally pledged a contribution of
Rs. 10,000. Tom Alter ('68) matched his pledge, as did a third
old student who wishes to remain anonymous, for a total of Rs.
30,000 in leadership pledges.<p>
     The proposal has been submitted to the Woodstock
administration and board for their reaction.<p>
     At the same time, the Council instructed WOSA President
Kiran Kapoor ('74) to appoint a committee, to include Tensingh 
Nema and Sec./Tres. Glenn Conrad, to develop a three-year 
fundraising plan targeting the WOSA-India membership.<p>
     The proposal would provide an endowment for scholarships 
for WOSA children of Indian nationality who would not otherwise
be able to attend Woodstock. <p>
     The proposal describes the scholarship as one which "would 
be awarded annually by the School's Grants Committee to one or
more students who are Indian citizens, children of former 
students, and who the School is ready to admit but who are not in 
any other preferred category and would be unable to go to 
Woodstock without the  scholarship."<p>
     The exact mechanism for implementing the scholarship is  
one of several questions that remain to be clarified with the  
school, but the general idea is that the Rs. 10 lakh would beheld
and invested by Woodstock, with interest used to aid a student
Woodstock designates following general criteria of the endowments
terms.<p>
     "All of us who went to Woodstock owe a part of who we are to
that experience," Mr. Nema wrote in his proposal. "We came to
Woodstock by many different paths, and had different reactions,
but for most of us it was a positive event in our lives.<p>
     "The support structure which once sustained the School is  
changing, and it has occurred to more than one of us that if we
were standing at the Woodstock gate today, finances might prevent
us from attending. It is a reality shared by many old students."<p>
     Mr. Nema, affectionately known in the Woodstock community as
"Momo," also pointed out that "the School is searching for
support systems to replace the outdated ones as they fall away. <p>
     "The School would benefit from the Scholarship. It should
also give a sense of satisfaction to us as WOSA-India, and as
individuals," he wrote. <p>
     "As old students, some of us might contribute because of
sentiment, some for the satisfaction of giving something back,
some out of a wish to help the school and make it a better place,
and some out of a sense of philosophical support for the kind of
education the School is giving. The fact that our reasons vary
does not matter. In the end, we all would benefit and so would
the School."  <p>
     Tensingh also pointed out that if each WOSA member living 
in India would contribute just Rs. 3,000 the goal would be
reached.<p>
     The proposal adopted by the Council suggests the goal be 
pursued as a three-year project.<p>
     The next meeting of the WOSA-India Council is scheduled for 
June 16, in Mussoorie.
