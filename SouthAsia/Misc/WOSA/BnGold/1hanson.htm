 A strong, new fence at the edge of Hanson makes the field
look better than it has in a long time, and also means 30 meters
of extra space for field sports. Renovation of the field, a WOSA-
India and Class of '49 project will proceed in several phases.<p>

<h3>Project is under way: Usable space on Hanson expanding.</h3>

     An 18-foot high fence running across the southern and of
Woodstock's Hanson Field has expanded the usable area of the
field by more than 30 meters.  The fence is the first visible
sign of a renovation of the athletic field that has been in the
works for several years.<p>
     The renovations have been made possible by donations from
the class of 1949 and funds raised by WOSA-India. This support is
recognized in the text of a marble marker embedded in the wall
which supports the new fence.<p>
Work on the field began December 31, 1995, with laying of the
marble marker, distribution of sweets, a puri and subzi lunch,
and an inaugural baseball game.<p>
     While the new fence will have minimal effect on the length
of the track that the field can accommodate, it is a dramatic
improvement for field sports such as soccer, cricket and hockey.
     Work is also nearing completion on improvements at the
northern end of the field.  Excavations and improvement in the
nullas in the northeastern and northwestern corners of the field,
construction of a finished drain across the northern edge, and 
temporary drain along the western edge of the field should
dramatically improve drainage.<p>
     These improvements are expected to increase the usability of
the field during and immediately after the monsoon when the
soccer and track seasons take place.<p>
     The work is the first step in a planned four-phase
renovation of the field. In the second phases of the project a
low pushta and walkway will be built between the northwestern
comer and western bleachers. Plans call for the temporary drain
now in place to be upgraded later.<p>
     Plans for the remainder of Phases III and IV have not yet be
finalized, but may include cutting back the northern section of
the eastern edge of the field, adding a low pushta from the
northeastern catchment to the existing pushta on the eastern 
side of the field below the old Eastwood estate, cutting the
western bleachers slightly to straighten that edge of the field,
constructing additional seating, and perhaps renovating the
locker and equipment building above the western bleachers.<p>
     Much will depend on the availability of funding. At a
meeting held February 22, the WOSA Council (of WOSA-India) voted
to sponsor an event in Bombay this fa11 with hopes of raising an
additional 1 lakh of rupees for the project. Plans for the event
are being coordinated by Tom Alter ('68) and Shiv Nanda ('58).<p>
     In a letter read to the Council of WOSA-India, and also
conveyed to the Class of 1949, Physical Education Department 
Head Ajay Mark conveyed the thanks of the entire school for the
support and interest that has made the renovation possible.<p>
     In the early part of the century, Woodstock ordinarily
rented Taylor's Flat, near the bottom of Mullingar Hill, for
sports events. In 1936, Principal A.E. Parker proposed that the
school build its own field. Sports Day was held at the Hanson
Field site for the first time in 1941.<p>
     Originally called Midwood Flat, the field was renamed in
honor of alumnus Robert Hanson ('37), an American who died in the
Second World War after earning the Congressional Medal of Honor.
