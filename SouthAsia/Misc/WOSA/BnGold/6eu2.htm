<hr>

     We have gathered here to give thanks to God for the life of
Gavin McIntosh, to remember the sort of person he was, to express
our grief and sorrow, to renew our confidence in the goodness of
God in our confusion and anger, to pray for Jenny, Simon, Anita,
Hannah, Ben and the rest of the family, that God will comfort
them at this time.<p>
     Gavin was one of life's unforgettable characters.
     He spend his formative years in China, where his mother anal
father were missionaries with the China Inland Mission. These
experiences shaped his life.<p>
     He did his secondary education in New Zealand and further
education in Otago University in Dunedin. He earned an MA and
Diploma of Teaching, and later completed a Bachelor's of Divinity
at Melbourne College of Divinity. <p>
     Gavin taught in New Zealand high schools, and then in
1973-74 at Wynberg-Allen School in Mussoorie. In January, 1979,
he became general secretary of the Tertiary Students Christian
Fellowship.  In February, 1986, he joined Woodstock School as
vice principal, and was the Acting Principal in 1986-87 and again 
in the fall of 1990.<p>
     Gavin left Woodstock in July, 1994, and become pastor of the
Baptist Church in Wellington, New Zealand.<p>
     We recall and remember a man who embraced life. Gavin was
always climbing mountains, both literally and figuratively. His
exploits are well-known and will live on in our memories.  He was
a fanatical cyclist.  He loved his Bullet, he loved hiking and
knew the mountains.  He was a great story-teller, with a
wonderful sense of humor, a keen, razor-shop mind, an man of
cryptic comments, a lucid writer, an excellent communicator whose
pertinent comments cut through the drivel. He set himself high
standards, was a man you could trust, a person of integrity.   
Gavin had strong views, often quite original and provocative, not
always understood by others. <p>
     He challenged accepted notions.  but he had people's best
interests at heart, and when the smoke had cleared and the dust
had settled, there was a relationship that nothing could shake.<p>
     Gavin was a man of wide interest, whether it was music, or
just sitting in tea shops observing the seasons of the year.<p>
     We remember a man of  unflinching loyalty to Woodstock
School. He looked at the broader picture. Sometimes he had the
administrative chair where tough and controversial decisions were
made. Gavin had a big heart, underneath he was a very sensitive
man who understood the dilemmas and complexities of life, but who
made the difficult decisions nonetheless.<p>
     We remember a man with a deep faith and trust in God, in who
He was and how He had worked through history, a man who believed
there was another dimension to life, and whose hope was built on
the life, teachings and resurrection of Jesus. He was a person
who knew the power and presence of God through the Holy Spirit,
and who worked in partnership and cooperation with the Christian 
Church in India.<p>
     We remember a man who loved his family.<p>
     Let us give thanks to God for the life and testimony of
Gavin.  He has set us a fine example of service and sacrifice. 
Let us be up and about, for as Gavin himself wrote, "I can never
sit in the sun for long."<p>

1927-1996 
</h2>

Comments by Principal Ron Flaming at Ron Kapadia's funeral</a> in St.
Paul's Church, Mussoorie, May 4, 1996.</i>

<hr>
     I would like to say a few words about Mr. Kapadia and his
life. He found his friends from around the world and many of them
have called yesterday and today from all around the world.<p>
     Ron Kapadia was born in Delhi on September 27, 1927.<p>
     He attended Delhi United Christian School, and spent early
years in a household that included eight brothers, sisters and
cousins. One of them, Mr. Charles Dean, has been in Mussoorie for
several weeks and is here with Saroj and with us today.<p>
     At the end of his school years, in 1942, Ron and his older
cousin, Ramsey, spent a brief period in the Navy and then joined
the Central Ordnance Depot in Delhi, where Ron worked until the
mid-1950s.<p>
     During that time, through his friend George McArther, he met
a young Isabella Thoburn graduate by the name of Sarojini
Lawrence who was teaching at Woodstock School.<p>
     Ron came to Mussoorie. He and Saroj were married in Almora
January 18, 1956. This year they celebrated 40 years of marriage
together.<p>
     The first mention of Ron in Woodstock School's records comes
in a letter sent to him April 29, 1958, by Canon S.R Burgoyne,
then the principal. It begins: "Dear Mr. Kapadia: We are keen to
employ someone of ability, experience and integrity who will not
only drive the new jeep truck and care for general
maintenance,'but will also share in the responsibilities involved
in purchasing.  I think I am right in understanding that our
mutual friend Sharmaji has mentioned this post to you as one
which you might undertake." It was a post he took.<p>
     This description, at the beginning of Ron's association with
Woodstock School, was one that said much about how we would work
together, both in terms of the many things he did, and in terms
of the way he did them. It was one of those careers, and Ron was
one of those individuals, which defines an institution.<p>
     Ron was soon filling the post of Supervisor of Buildings and
Grounds, helping with supervision at the Boys hostel, and acting
as liaison with government officials.<p>
     In 1972, Ron and Saroj were formally appointed Hostel
Supervisors and served in that position for three years. It is
testimony to his capabilities that this post came in addition to
his continuing duties as Buildings and Grounds Supervisor.<p>
     In 1983, Ron and Saroj were sent by Woodstock to the United
States.  As part of that trip they helped along the process that
established an old students association in that country.<p>
     No description of the posts Ron held, or the projects he
directed, could possibly communicate his full significance to
Woodstock School, And to the larger community in Mussoorie and
beyond.<p>
     Ron did not just belong to Woodstock. He was fully, and
completely a member of the Mussoorie community.  He loved hunting
and the outdoor life, and could often be found walking in the
hills that he loved.<p>
     He was a long-time member and distinguished Past President
of the Rotary Club of Mussoorie, and was a good friend and public
figure in that role to many of you who are here today. We know
that the Rotary Club and Ron's many friends and neighbors from
beyond Woodstock School will miss him as deeply as any of us.<p>
     But for many of us, when we think of Ron, we think of
Woodstock, and when we think of Woodstock, it is hard to think of
it without Ron.<p>
     Mr Kapadia retired in 1988, but continued to serve the 
school as a consultant.  Where once he had been a valued colleague,
he now stayed as our closest neighbor and one of our senior
statesmen and advisors.<p>
     In 1992, Ron and Saroj again visited the United States on
Woodstock's behalf, and were honored as the chief guests of the
Woodstock Old Students Association at their 3-day national
convention.<p>
     For almost 40 years, from the time of his joining Woodstock
until this moment, Mr. Kapadia and Woodstock School have
travelled together. Four generations of students, four decades of
principals and department heads, and four decades of staff
members regarded Ron Kapadia as someone who could give the right
advice in a difficult moment, the right word of encouragement in
a time of weakness, the right note of fatherly discipline, or
just the right joke or touch of humor when the occasion needed
it. All of us account it a privilege to have known him and will
miss him very much.<p>
     Ron is survived by his wife Saroj, his son Fail, daughter
Shahnaz, brothers and sisters Joyce Barnard, Richard Jenkins and
Winifred Jenkins, and cousins Ramsey Dean and Charles Dean. To
you we wish our deepest sympathies and assure you that our
prayers are with you.
