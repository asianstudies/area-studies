     Imagine a Woodstock student going to Washington for a week
listening to the Vice President of the U. S. while classmates
slave away. Selected on the basis of an application and
interview, Hilja Terry represented Woodstock at the National
Leader.ship Forum last fall (1995).<p>
     Hilja traveled alone to Washington where she stayed at the
Marriot Hotel along with 400 students. <p>
     The Forum was started by politicians who met to talk about
Jesus as a leader. During the conference many American political
leaders addressed the youngsters. The students also painted
schools and picked squash for a food bank.
