     Middle School students and staff seem to have renewed
enthusiasm this semester - everyone agrees renovations in the
Middle School area are a significant improvement. <p>
     Things look great, with fresh white paint and bright red
carpets. A new hallway access to the Middle School area above the
Quad Auditorium makes it feel more central and more connected to
the Quad. <p>
     The overall effect is that the Middle School is more
educationally alive and has received increased visibility at
Woodstock.<p>
     Additions include a new audio-visual learning center next to
the Quad Library, auld a new staff workroom area on the same noon
Two classrooms are now more usably sized, and the Quad Auditorium
is refurbished with stage and window curtains along with striking
new paint.<p>
     The office and teacher's workroom are also reconfigured into
lighter, more accessible rooms. Even the book room is more
conveniently located.<p>
     The precursor of all this was a well equipped science 
laboratory completed last semester, which is also getting lots of
use in the Middle School. As a result, science is coming alive
for many students as they do more intricate laboratory
experiments in the new facility.<p>

     The elementary area of the Quad School received attention
last semester as well. Bright red, blue, green and yellow
doorways lead the way into clean, organized classrooms. <p>

     Two colorful and stimulating animal murals grace the wall in
the hallway and the third grade room. It is a feast 'or the eyes
to walk slown the elementary hallway, with children's work
samples and art pieces hanging on the brightly colored bulletin  
boards.<p>
     We are proud of our Quad School surroundings.<p>

     Did you know that Woodstock School was the third school outside of the United States to receive American accreditation.
The first two were in Paris and Geneva.<p>

<h2><a name="dire">Directory will go forward</a></h2>

     At a meeting held February 22 in Delhi, the WOSA-India
Council decided to go ahead with plans to publish a directory of
all WOSA members living in India.<p>
     The Council had been reconsidering the plan after learning
that an updated WOSA directory listing members world-wide is to
be published in North America this summer.<p>
     Council members felt there were a number of advantages to a 
separate WOSA-India directory.  They asked Prem Bery ('49) to
proceed with his plans.<p>
     Mr. Bery, a member of the Council, is heading up the project
for WOSA-India. <p>
     The group also encouraged Mr. Bery to continue exploring the
possibility of offsetting costs by selling advertisements, and
authorized him to co opt other Council members or WOSA members to
assist.
