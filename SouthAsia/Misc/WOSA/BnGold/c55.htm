Librarian Margaret McDonald is in high gear these days, thanks in
part to some timely support from the Class of 1956. Woodstock
School would like to express its thanks to the class for donating
a computer for use of the High School library. The gift was made
in fond memory of Miss Vera Msrley who worked at Woodstock for so
many years. Members of the class made the gift during a reunion
held in Mussoorie last year.
