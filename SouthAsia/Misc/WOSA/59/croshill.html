      Although the most important hill stations served as seasonal centers of government,
administrative buildings were not always the defining or en- during landmarks. Hill stations
often had and still have-in addition to their offices, hospitals, country homes, churches, clubs,
and libraries-at least one grand hotel or rustic lodge, boarding schools, a brewery, a lake (usually
created by damming a stream), a botanical garden, wildlife sanctuaries, a golf course, hiking
trails, a race course or gymkhana ground for competitive games, and plenty of horses or ponies
for mountain rides. A lot of hill stations have ghosts, "European" flowers, strawberries, and, alas,
armies of uninvited monkeys. The monkeys are especially numerous in India, where Hanuman,
the monkey god, is an important mythological figure <p>

<b>++ Page 9 </b>    "1. How It All Began"<p>

and an object of worship. Hanuman's descendants are marvelously adept at finding tourist
attractions and picnic spots. I noticed a gang of them pan- handling beside a speed bump on the
road up to Ooty, where they knew they couldn't be missed when the tourist buses slowed to
negotiate the bump. In Darjeeling, they hang out at the temples on Observatory Hill trying to
look very hungry and forlorn. In Simla, half a dozen of them were entertaining themselves by
removing and tossing around a traveler's laundry that had been hung outside a guest house
window to dry. <p>

     <a href="mailto:rehan33596@aol.com">Rehan Khan</a>, who describes himself as a 
"lifer" at one of the most famous of boarding
schools in the Indian hills, Woodstock, in Mussoorie, spent all his secondary-school years there
in the ig8os and remembers a lush campus with a lot of "red-butted monkeys" among the prolific
wildlife. "In my first year at school," he recalled, "I was walking down the path to the
dormitories eating a sandwich when a group of monkeys started to chase me. Needless to say,
they were after my sandwich. I remembered the oft-repeated chant of my peers: Do not ever run
away from a monkey. If you happen to visit Mussoorie and a monkey chases you, muster up your
best growl and run toward the animal. In my five years at Woodstock I always kept my food-and
also perfected a pretty mean growl." A decade earlier, Gil Halstead, another student hiking in the
hills, was pelted with pine cones tossed by silver langurs, who also enjoyed sitting on a cliff
overlooking the Woodstock campus and taunting boys and girls as they walked to classes.<p>

     The presence and ultimately the proliferation of boarding schools in the hills stemmed
from a distressing dilemma faced by many parents during  the colonial era.  Sending children
back to the West for schooling split  families for long periods.  But keeping sons and daughters at
home in the  colonies reduced their educational opportunities and risked their health.  Life in the
Asian colonies could be hard on children. Their small graves  are scattered everywhere, painful
even to an uninvolved traveler, who cannot help but feel the parents' intolerable sorrow.  In
southern India . . . . . .

<a href="http://www.indiagov.org/tourism/hills/mussoor.htm">
<img align=right src="http://www.indiagov.org/tourism/images/mussorie.gif">Mussoorie</a>, most recently 
a mammoth mountain lodge called the
Residency, which advertises itself as "the first five-star deluxe hotel in the hills of North India."
But it was the legendary Savoy-- not the squash courts or pool of the Residency-that propelled
me to Mussoorie in the dead of winter on my most recent trip. It was the second time I foolishly
made the climb from Dehra Dun in cold weather. My son, Jonathan, and I had visited the
Woodstock School in Landour more than a decade ago. He, hardened by short-pants British
education, nonetheless remembers Woodstock as the coldest place he ever had to get out of bed
in the morning. But at least our guest room had an efficient bukbari, a wood stove that can be
started quickly with almost anything flammable and will produce warmth very quickly. In the
1950s, when Edith Theis-Nielsen was a student at Woodstock, she found the cold- water showers
"trying" in winter. "For at least 15 years after my time at Woodstock, I was thankful every time I
turned on the hot-water tap," she recalled. Theis-Nielsen, who is Danish, had brought along a
Scandinavian eiderdown for her bed. "Once at room inspection the matron gave me a demerit
because she didn't think my bed was properly made. I explained to her that an eiderdown has no
way of being made flat as a pancake." <p>

     Rehan Khan, who was a student at Woodstock in the 1980s, said he never remembered it
snowing, but "a few avalanches in the mountains every month provided badly needed
excitement." The next time I arrived in Mussoorie the town was deep in snow, adding
considerable adventure if not exactly excitement to the experience. Leaving a hired car and its
dubious driver at the base of the hill crowned by the Savoy, I plodded up on foot, lugging my
laptop and luggage along a frozen pathway with an angle of ascent approaching 45 degrees, if not
more. It was dark, and there seemed no end to a slippery hike up a long curved driveway circling
toward the Savoy's private hill. Then around the bend, there suddenly was a speck of light, a
small cottage and a trellised doorway bearing a modest sign that read "Office." A naked yellow
bulb illuminated it and the doorstep below. All else was lost in the black night, except the acres
of snow. In the bitter cold, absolutely nothing moved; even the trees seemed frozen.<p>

     Decades vanished in the few moments that followed my opening the door, with some
uncertainty about whether I had come to the right hotel. Inside was a small foyer with a
chest-high barricade of bank-teller windows that would have made Dickens comfortable. One
sign over an old metal grill said "Reception." Others said "Cashier," "Bills," and
"Miscellaneous." On the wall, there were boards for pinning up one's calling card to. . .

Landour's most famous institution, the Woodstock School, was founded in 1854 as a school for
Protestant girls, many of them American or British children of missionaries. In 1874, the Board
of Foreign Missions of the American Presbyterian church took over management, an
arrangement that lasted until the early 1920S, when the school became inter-denominational,
though it never lost its earnest missionary atmosphere. At that point, boys were accepted as
boarders; until then they were admitted only as day pupils. Like the Kodaikanal International
School in South India, Woodstock has managed to keep alive strong links with American
Protestant churches, despite India's unease about foreign Christians and their influence. Maureen
Aung-Thwin, a Burmese-American who was educated at Kodai, where her mother also taught,
told me that whole families became associated with these schools. The alumni are loyal friends
who watch over Woodstock's fortunes just as Woodstock in turn watches over its natural
environment. From the air, the school is enveloped in green. Rehan Khan remembers the lush,
luxuriant foliage of the campus when he was there in the late 1980s--"a respite for sore eyes"
after a walk through treeless Mussoorie town. The rainy, unspoiled forest presented its own
problems, of course. "My most poignant memory of driving up to Mussoorie was the feeling of
terrible gloom when the school reopens in July," he said. "The sky is overcast, it is raining
heavily and it is a three-mile hike strewn with leeches from the town to the school." Gil Halsted
learned about jungle wildlife in 1972 when he and his friends, exhausted from climbing Nag
Tibba, decided to camp overnight at a deserted government rest house, only to be shocked out of
their sleep by a water buffalo barging in through the front door. <p>

     Woodstock and the Kodaikanal school, which briefly considered a merger at one point,
have had a powerfid influence on many individuals, Americans and others, who support active
alumni associations and retain their links to India and each other through these institutions. Edith
Theis- Nielsen, who studied in a special class for Europeans and others at Woodstock who
needed to take the British Cambridge secondary-school examinations, said the school had many
activities that challenged students to think independently, though she and others bristled at the
demonstrative Christianity of the missionary environment. But there was always also tolerance
and an atmosphere of sharing. She later went to a boarding school in France and found it "run
with military discipline separated from meaningful values." Students did not care for one another
as they did at Woodstock, she said. "When I left Woodstock, I did't think there was anything
unusual  <p>

<b>++Page  70 </b> "3. An Indian Sextet"<p>

about the school. But as the years passed, I realized how much Woodstock students and parents
differed radically-in a positive way-from the people who surrounded me later in life in a purely
secular context. I had given up being a believer. But in my search later for people who were like
the ones at Woodstock, I also found faith rooted in the Bible."<p>

     <a href="maito:whl@dmi.net">Wilbur H. Lyon</a>, a physician who lives in Idaho, was 
among those who feel, as he put it,
"that exposure to international concerns at an early age helps one comprehend the complex world
in which we live today." Lyon, who graduated from Woodstock in 1940, absorbed firsthand the
tremors of approaching Indian independence. "India was then still British India," he wrote in an
e-mail message to me. (<a href="http://www.kwi.org/">Woodstock and Kodai schools</a>

     <blockquote>A classmate of mine was Chand Pandit. She was the daughter of Madame 
     JayalakshmiPandit, the sister of Jawaharlal Nehru. He was to become the first 
     Prime Minister of independent India and she would be India's Ambassador to 
     the United Nations. Madame Pandit invited Chand's classmates to a party at 
     her home after our baccalaureate service. At the party she stated that she expected to be
     imprisoned soon because of the stand she felt she needed to take, 
     even though she knew it was against British laws. She wanted us, as Chand's 
     classmates, to understand her views. She still stands out as one of the most 
     intelligent and gracious people I have met in my nearly 73 years. <p>

     As a sixteen-year-old boy with nearly all my life experience in British India, I was
     concerned that India would be worse off if the British were forced 
     out, since the British seemed to control the transportation, communications, 
     financial structure, law enforcement and so on in such a large and diversified 
     country. Her reply to my expression of this concern impressed me by making 
     me realize the difficulty our very young country has in really understanding 
     the thinking and philosophies of countries which are several thousand years 
     old. She replied very calmly and graciously: "Yes, we will be worse off at first, 
     and it may be 200 years until things are as good as they are today. Then 
     things will get better, because that is the way it should be." At that time, my 
     country was 166 years old. In the U.S.A. we are very impatient if our goals 
     cannot be met in a four-year term or a fiscal year. </blockquote>

Young Wilbur also confronted other Indian realities at an early age, and came away sobered.  

     <blockquote>I remember as a thirteen-year-old student a feature speaker at one of our assemblies was
     one of India's top socioeconomists. He made one point that captured my youthful
     attention. He remarked that India had a serious problem because the previous year there
     had been an "unsuccessful famine." By </blockquote>

<b>++Page 71</b>   "3. An Indian Sextet"  <p>

    <blockquote> that he meant that only about 20,000 people had died of starvation, rather than the
     predicted number ten times higher. This would result in many more people to feed and
     house in the years ahead than the country was prepared to support. This was entirely at
     odds with my thinking, even as a thirteen-year-old American boy</blockquote>.

     The internationalism of Woodstock meant a lot to most of its students. "I remember the
smells of breakfast and of the winter, the village and its northern influence on my experience of
India and its culture," said Monica Flores, who entered Woodstock in 1988.  <p>

     <blockquote>I was the was the only Mexican at the time, even the only Hispanic. The experience made
     me stronger in my own beliefs and more fully cultured. I learned a lot about uprooted
     children like myself; my father was in business and I never lived more than five years in
     one place. I have returned to Monterrey, Mexico, my birth town and work for a Dutch
     company now. I have a managerial position, a top staff job in a highly male culture. I
     know some of this is due to what the Woodstock experience taught me about being true
     to yourself--and how when you feel you represent only yourself you discover there is a
     lot of you in others.</blockquote>

     Woodstock may have its lifelong friends and guardian angels, but other venerable
institutions like the Savoy Hotel are in trouble in a new India. Anand Singh, the duty manager,
told me the next morning how this came to be. As in Pakistan, many people in India with money
to spend on vacations no longer want what an old hotel has to offer, a quiet formality tinged with
eccentricity. Less-affluent tourists, coming to the hills in mushrooming numbers, would find it
too expensive, even at the equivalent of about $35 a night, though it is doubtful it would hold any
attraction for them either. Most visitors, including the busloads being disgorged that morning on
a national holiday, the birthday of the Indian nationalist (and fascist sympathizer?)

Chandra Bose</a>, go to places with names like Sun 'n' Star, the Shilton, or the Honeymoon Inn.
They ride a precarious cable car or hire the somnolent horses that are part of a hill station's
repertoire. Like Murree, Mussoorie has a revolving restaurant and dozens of souvenir shops
stocked by Kashmiris. Tibetans, perhaps even more successful merchants than Kashmiris, are
also part of commercial life here, as they are now part of the scene in every hill station bazaar
from the Himalayas to the blue Nilgiri Hills and the Palni highlands of the South.<p>

     The Savoy is wileng to rent sections of the hotel to banks and corporations to use for staff
recreation; "holiday homes" is the Indian expression.. . .

     MANY OF THE PEOPLE who helped me in many ways in the writing of this book are
quoted or mentioned in its pages and bibliography. But there are also those who are not named
whose assistance and encouragement were immeasurable. A book on the hill stations of colonial
Asia in all its varieties might not have existed at all had it not been for Laura Parsons of
Westview Press, whose knowledge of the region and the genre made her receptive to an idea few
others understood. I was introduced to her by Sumit Ganguly of Hunter College at the City
University of New York, who also arranged for me to meet his parents in Calcutta; and Nandini
and Romen Ganguly, veterans of many hill station "seasons," who generously shared their
reminiscences.<p>

      <a href="mailto:janecummings@mindspring.com">Jane Cummings</a>, 
executive director of the Kodai Woodstock International association,
offered me access to the 
<a href="http://www.kwi.org/">Internet websites of Kodaikanal and Woodstock schools</a>, 
which put me
in touch with alumni on several continents. At the University of Virginia, 
<a href="http://poe.acc.virginia.edu/~pm9k/">Philip McEldowney</a>,
the librarian and a Woodstock graduate, took the time to compile a bibliography of books on hill
stations all over India. I was directed to him by another Woodstock alumnus, Rodney Jones. <p>

     Patricia Herbert of the British Library in London was equally generous with her expert
advice on Burma and her willingness to find and supply me with accounts from old official
gazetteers. Sarah Timewell at Geographic Expeditions in San Francisco brought me up to date on
contemporary Burma and recommended places to stay and see in Maymyo and other hill towns.
In New York, Kyaw Tha Hla translated articles from Burmese-language publications given to me
in Maymyo by their authors. At the University of Pennsylvania, David Nelson, the librarian for
South Asia, opened his magnificent collection to me and helped me locate out-of-print books that
would otherwise have been very difficult to trace. <p>

     In New Delhi, P J. Anthony, a friend and colleague, took time to plan an itinerary that
efficiently packed an unbelievable amount of travel into barely a month of revisiting the distant
hills of North and South India, and then sent me on to Sri Lanka without a hitch, in a part of the
world where almost anything that can go wrong usually does. In New York, Nancy Newhouse,
editor of the New York Times Sunday travel section, was always open to suggestions for articles
about Asian places, however remote or unfamiliar, that I visited as a foreign correspondent.
Some material in this book, therefore, first appeared in different forms in the Times travel pages.  <p>

<b>++Page  246  </b>     "Acknowledgments"<p>

      Joseph Lelyveld, executive editor of The Times, not only allowed me to take three
months leave to travel in the Asian hills but also shared his own recollections of Maymyo, and
told me that George Orwell's memorable description of the town was to be found not in Burmese
Days but, of all places, in Homage to Catalonia.<p>

      As always, my husband, David Wigg, was my first and most trustworthy critic. <p>

     Finally, there are those no longer alive: the reporters, memoir writers, and diarists who
over two centuries jotted down their joys and tribulations in colonial service, bringing to life the
West's encounters with some of the world's most fascinating cultures. Their history is now part of
Asia's as well as ours. <p>
