<P>Editorial Note</P>

<P>It should be a matter of some satisfaction for all of us that the
discussion on globalization within the Indian Left and radical circles
has been, from the very beginning, much more sensitive than similar
discussion elsewhere, to the role of finance as a driving force behind
this process, and indeed as a major element shaping the new epoch. While
it is only in recent times that radical economists in the AngloSaxon
world are starting to emphasize the pre-eminent role of finance in the
new conjuncture, as a factor underlying the slowing down of the growth
of world capitalism, the enfeeblement of the nation-State as an agency
of "demand management", and the opening up of the globe to free
"capital", as distinct from commodity, flows, the Indian radical
critiques on globalization have been dwelling on these themes for quite
some time now.  Earlier, and to some extent even now, the dominant
position among Anglo-Saxon radical writers attributed the slowing down
of world capitalist growth to what was called "over-accumulation" of the
earlier period, of the so-called "Golden Age of capitalism"; and the
drive towards globalization, as well as the emergence of finance to a
prominent position, was explained as a fallout of this
"over-accumulation". Several Indian writers, however, got to the role of
finance straightaway and directly, without traversing the dubious route
of "over-accumulation". The lead article by S. P. Shukla, which contains
the text of his Parwana Memorial Lecture, and the subsequent piece by
Prasenjit Bose, which is a review article on the influential book by
Ellen Meiksins Wood, <I>The Empire of Capital</I>, illustrate in
different ways this point about the greater cognizance of the role of f
inance in the Indian discussion.</P>

<P>The terms of trade between agriculture and industry have always been
a matter of intense debate among analysts of the Indian economy. There
was a time in the late-sixties and early-seventies when the terms of
trade movements <I>in favour</I> of agriculture were a source of concern
as they were seen to be choking off the growth process of the Indian
economy. Of late however, as a consequence of the pursuit of neo-liberal
policies, the terms of trade have moved sharply <I>against</I> the
agricultural sector. The piece by M. Raghavan, while emphasizing this
point, argues that while PDS and price-support to farmers constituted
the twin-pillars of our earlier farm-</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>price policy, both are being decimated now, with potentially very
serious adverse consequences for the economy. .</P>

<P>Atis Dasgupta's paper argues that the spread of Islam in Bengal was
neither an act of imposition by the Turk-Afghan rulers, nor a sudden
wave of conversions from Hinduism to Islam. On the contrary, the process
of absorption of Islam was not only long but marked by a strong element
of continuity, which arose in turn from the fact that the
<I>Sahajiya</I> tradition and the heterodox <I>Sufi</I> saints had much
in common. There was, if anything, a tension between the <I>mullahs</I>,
and the <I>maulavis</I>, adherents of Islamic orthodoxy, on the one
hand, and the syncretic-pantheistic beliefs and practices of the
majority. of the rural Muslims on the other. This tension was
accompanied by a similar tension between the <I>ashraf</I> culture of
the urban immigrant Muslims and the rural <I>atrap</I> culture of the
Muslim peasants and artisans. .</P>

<P>Two outstanding Marxist intellectuals, Christopher Hill, the British
historian, and Paul Sweezy, the American economist, both of whom
exercised enormous influence on countless young students all over the
world, and contributed towards making Marxism a powerful intellectual
tool, as distinct from merely a tool of political analysis, passed away
in recent months. We pay our homage to both these thinkers in the
current number of <I>Social Scientist</I>, but in different ways. We
carry an obituary article on Sweezy written by Prasenjit Bose, and a
research paper on Hill written by Soma Marik.</P>
