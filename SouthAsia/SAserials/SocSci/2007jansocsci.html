<P class="style7">Editorial</P>
<P class="style5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>There are many ways in which the  State is transformed in the era of neoliberalism. In the lead article of this  issue Prabhat Patnaik examines one of the less discussed changes in the nature  of the State during this era in developing countries such as India. This he  identifies as a change in the &quot;texture&quot; of the State, reflected in a  transformation of the nature of the bureaucracy, other State personnel, and the  &quot;organic intellectuals&quot; at large.</strong></P>
<P class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Capitalism, Patnaik notes, differs  from feudalism inasmuch as there is a degree of opacity in the nature of the relationship  between the State and civil society, with the State appearing as standing apart  from or above the directly visible process of exploitation. This ability gives  the State the social legitimacy which is necessary for the stability of  capitalism.</P>
<P class="style6"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, for  the State to appear as acting in the interests of society as a whole, the State  personnel must internalise this ideology, despite the fact that the essential  tendency of capitalism is to assimilate all into its agenda of operating for  profit. Thus a major contradiction in capitalism is the fact that its spontaneous  tendencies undermine the conditions for its social legitimacy.</P>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This  contradiction posed a problem in the era of monopoly capitalism when a profound  change occurred not just in the policies but also in the personnel of the  State. This was the period when there was a degree of coalescence between finance  capital and the personnel of the State, when the social legitimacy the latter  derives from its image as an entity standing above society and guarding its  overall interests got undermined. This was the period when, as under fascism,  legitimacy was sought to be acquired through other means: by invoking an enemy  that is a common foe of the entire society, against which the State is  projected as engaging in struggle; or by uniting society for a common purpose  behind some imperialist project of acquiring &quot;glory&quot; or  &quot;national pride&quot;.</p>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These were  problems that were resolved otherwise in the post-War world of Keynesian demand  management in the developed countries and State-led, import-substituting  industrialisation in the developing world, when imperialism was in temporary  retreat. But with the recent rise to dominance of globalised finance, when</p>

<P class="style5"><I><B>Social Scientist</B></I>, p. 2</P>
  <P class="style6">Social Scientist enormous increases in disparities in income  and wealth have occurred both in the metropolis and in the third world, the  issue of the social legitimacy of the bourgeois State has reasserted itself. In  the current context, as in India, the State is predominantly manned by personnel  whose ideological predilections are closely aligned to the views of the Bretton  Woods institutions, and who are also deeply enmeshed with the world of finance and  big business.</P>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This  necessitates quest for alternative sources of legitimacy. In India's case this  is partly realised, through the concoction of a mixed brew of two notions, of  the &quot;nation&quot; becoming a superpower (&quot;India shining&quot;), and  of the &quot;nation&quot; being under threat from external enemies supported by  an internal &quot;fifth column&quot;.</p>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  strategies adopted by those who build the idea th-?.t the nation is under  threat, is investigated by Rajeev Dhavan in his article or. the campaign by the  'Hindutva' right against India's renowned painter M.F. Husain who has been  profiled as a target because he is a Muslim. Identifying the campaign as a  coercive intimidation strategy, Dhavan traces in detail in this case the  pre-Htigative and litigation stages of the campaign. When the intimidators initiate  the process using lawyers to file a criminal case, the latter becomes the  province of the police and the state prosecutors. Even though these may appear  to be independent and fair persons, that need not be the case. They are both  part of the 'State' as well as 'society'. And the 'State' is also enmeshed in  the prevailing social, financial and political structures and is therefore  subject to their pressures.</p>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhavan  analyses the Hussain case as an instance illustrating the rise of Hindutva as  India's new politicized religious faith as part of the reinvention of India. In  this agenda, the reclamation of Hinduism requires, among much else the  denigration of Islam. In time, this agenda is extended to include the electoral  conquest of India. For this, what was needed was a continuous stream of events  including those that physically and mentally attacked others so as to gather  the Hindutva faithful. Hussain being Muslim provided the basis for one such set  of events. According to Dhavan, what the Husain case sets up is a pattern for  the future. In his view, to correct this tendency, the Indian law on hate  speech needs to be reviewed and changed.</p>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third  paper in this issue focuses attention on one aspect of the phase of neo-liberal  growth: the growing disproportionality between the rates of growth of the  agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. The fact that this tendency persists  and even intensifies is surprising when examined in the light of the early  debate on the constraints to development in India and the rest of the  developing world. That debate had focused on the agrarian constraint to  development in countries where, inter alia, the agrarian transition had not  been completed by means such as radical land reform.</p>
<p class="style6"><span class="style5"><I><B>Social Scientist</B></I>, </span>p. 3 <em>Editorial</em></p>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The article  by C.P. Chandrasekhar examines the nature of the structural shift in the  pattern of recent growth in India when compared with the first three decades of  post-Independence development. Besides increased access to international finance  during the period of globalisation, there are three elements of the pattern of  growth under the neoliberal policy regime that seem to have made persisting  disproportionality possible. One is a change in the pattern of demand and  production, involving a reduction in the direct agricultural-input dependence  of the non agricultural sector. The second is that the pattern of manufacturing  growth under an open economic regime is such that the responsiveness of  employment growth to the growth in output tends to decline. This obviously  reduces the dependence of the non-agricultural sector on wage goods supplied by  the agricultural sector. The third is that the pattern of growth in the modern  services sector, which accounts for an important source of aggregate growth is  such that here too employment growth is very much slower than the growth of  output.</p>
<p class="style6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  consequence of these recent trends is that the Indian economy can record the  observed creditable rates of non-inflationary growth of aggregate GDP even when  the agricultural sector languishes. It appears that a feature of the growth  process in a more open and liberalised environment is that the peasantry has a  much smaller role in sustaining economic growth and can thus be partially  excluded from development. What is disconcerting is that the self-correcting  mechanism that existed in the earlier period to restore a semblance of balance  between agricultural and non-agricultural growth are no more operative. This  leaves the adjustment to political developments that are neither guaranteed nor  the least disruptive.</p>
