<P>Editorial</P>

<P>Aijaz Ahmad's paper which is the lead article of the current number
of <I>Social Scientist</I>, while providing an impressive sweep of
India's history, ends by calling for a "second instalment of our
incomplete national liberation movement". India's anti-colonial struggle
was not just a political struggle for ending British rule. It was a
comprehensive and inclusive movement for national awakening which sought
to unite the country on the basis of a secular and egalitarian agenda.
This agenda was predicated on a clear rejection, in principle at any
rate, of the centuries-old legacy of caste oppression, patriarchy and
cruelty to marginalized groups. The anti-colonial political struggle in
short was premised upon an implicit social contract, of which
<I>Hindutva</I> is as much a violation as the current acquiescence of
the ruling classes in the imperialist re-colonization of the economy, a
process that is euphemistically called "globalization". Aijaz Ahmad's
call for a second instalment of the freedom struggle therefore is
extremely apposite at this juncture.</P>

<P>But there can be little doubt that this second instalment cannot be a
mere replication of the first, that the <I>dramatis personae</I> of this
second act would be very different from those of the first. The
re-colonizing agency for a start is different: it is not the capital, or
the finance capital, of a particular imperialist country that is seeking
to assert hegemony, but <I>international</I> finance capital, an entity
that has become prominent of late. Its international nature is revealed
<I>inter alia</I> by the fact that the bourgeoisie of our country, like
other third world bourgeoisie, is closely enmeshed with it. The
bourgeoisie therefore cannot possibly provide the leadership to this
second phase of the freedom struggle. That role must fall to the working
class which has to ally itself with the peasantry and other sections of
petty producers and small capitalists. Even though sections of the
bourgeoisie may detach themselves at some future date from the hegemony
of finance capital, and become part of the new freedom struggle, they
would still be intrinsically incapable of leading such a struggle, since
the' historical potentials of bourgeois-led anti-imperialist struggles
are over, and no segment of the bourgeoisie has anything new to offer to
the people other than what it had already offered <I>and betrayed</I>.
And if the new struggle is to be led by the working class then it would
be necessarily informed by a perspective that transcends capitalism.</P>

<P><I><B>Social Scientist</B></I>, p. 2</P>

<P>There is of course a view, assiduously promoted by imperialism, that
we have reached "the end of history", that the "utopian" idea of
transcending capitalism is <I>pass&#233;</I> and that capitalism is the
final mode of production which is not only ever-durable but which also
promises mankind immense progress. This view however is the very
opposite of the truth. The stability of capitalism requires for its
sustenance the social support of petty property, which takes any attack
on capitalist property as a precursor of an attack on private property
in general, and gets frightened by it. It is this support that underlay
the collapse of the Paris Commune, and it is the absence of this
support, in situations where the bourgeoisie allied itself with large
landed property, that created the "weakest links" in the chain for the
proletariat to assert its hegemony. What the process of "globalization"
entails is a squeeze on petty production and even small capitalist
production, as is manifest even in our own country, which far from
signalling the end of history, presages a whole new era of struggles,
Lenin's prognostication of imperialism being the last stage of
capitalism may well reassert its relevance after the interregnum of a
few post-war decades of the so-called "Golden Age of Capitalism".</P>

<P>The current number of <I>Social Scientist</I> is marked apparently by
a thematic diversity. Nonetheless, whether it is Madhu Sethia's
discussion of 19th century Rajasthan poetry, or Selvyn Jussy's
discussion of the Literary movement and the growth of the Left in
Kerala, or Madhu Prasad's disquisition on the commercialization of
higher education, or the Mallick-Haribabu-Kulkarni paper on the
inter-war debates on science and technology in India, underlying all
these papers is an implicit engagement with the present and hence an
implicit link with the larger issue thrown up by Aijaz Ahmad.</P>
