<P>Introduction</P>

<P>This issue of the <I>Social Scientist</I> focuses on
colonia/contemporary Indian history. Projit Behari Mukarji examines the
classification strategies of the colonial administration with the
expanding boundary of colonialism and the problems posed by 'modernity'.
These complexities created the need to confront and communicate with new
environments and contexts and also to transfer knowledge acquired in one
context to another. There was thus a need to 'standardise' and
'rationalise' an unfamiliar reality. In fact, till the end of the
nineteenth century we find- botanists and government agencies admitting
that they often supplied the wrong drugs. As Mukharji argues, this
crisis resulted due to the growing 'extra-local' nature of the
pharmaceutical industry.</P>

<P>Indrani Sen's contribution focuses on the white woman's mental
illness over the second half of the nineteenth century in colonial
India. She delineates the gendered theories on psychiatry which
prevailed in the Victorian age and the turn of the century. She focuses
on the subordinate social position of the white woman in the colony.
Besides examining references to 'common' mental problems, the article
also focuses on the lunatic asylums of British India. Here, she takes up
the case histories of white women patients - generally of the lower
social orders - who were 'confined'. Sen highlights the intricacies of
both gender and class when it comes to the white woman's mental illness
in colonial India.</P>

<P>Nitin Varma studies the indenture system in the Assam tea
plantations. This system developed with the abolition of slavery and
problems of labour supply to the colonial plantations. It saw the
collusion between the capitalist and colonial interests to create a
system that was similar to slavery. Going beyond the 'freedom/unfreedom'
binary, the paper discusses the strategies of control that drew upon
various 'stereotypes', 'discourses' and 'practices', which were both
'dynamic and contested'. It examines assertions related to the
homogeneity of the 'capitalist class' and its collusive drives with the
state, in the classic 'planter-raj' model.  Varma argues that the
concerns and interests between both did not necessarily always
converge.</P>

<P>Finally, Panchanan Bhoi's contribution examines the</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>Social Scientist</I></B></P>
 
<P>development of an art form associated with the making of palm leaf
manuscripts in Orissa. Tracing its pre-colonial origins, the article
locates the diversities related to the technique of production of the
palm leaf manuscripts. It delineates the shifts and changes that this
art form went through over the nineteenth century with the growth of
print culture and the decline of patronage of the feudal sections. The
world of the scribe artists is explored through oral testimonies,
bringing to life fascinating details related to their diverse social and
religious origins. Bhoi's paper tells us of an art form that struggles
to survive under the pressure of globalisation.</P>
