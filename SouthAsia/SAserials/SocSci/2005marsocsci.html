<P>Editorial</P>

<P>The process of "opening up" of an economy to globalized financial
flows and the implications of such "opening up" are often discussed on
their own, and it is presumed that the baneful effects of such "opening
up" can be countered through controls on capital flows into and out of
the economy. In the lead article of the current issue of Social
Scientist, C.P.Chandrasekhar argues that discussing such "opening up" in
isolation from another phenomenon with which it is closely interlinked,
namely the re-shaping of the domestic financial structures of third
world economies in a manner that replicates the Anglo-Saxon "model", can
be grossly misleading. These two phenomena, "opening up" to global
financial flows and replicating the Anglo-Saxon financial structure,
always go together; financial crises and financial fragility are
inherent to each of these phenomena and hence appear in a pronounced
form when the two intertwine; both have to be resisted; resisting only
the phenomenon of "opening up", through the imposition of capital
controls for example, is inadequate in the absence of resistance to the
so-called "liberalization" of the domestic financial structure.</P>

<P>The so-called Anglo-Saxon "model" itself however is of recent
vintage. The paper, while tracing the history of the emergence of this
Anglo-Saxon "model" in the United States, on the ashes of the financial
structure put together by Roosevelt after the Great Depression, draws
attention to what is one of its central but little-analyzed features,
namely the "socialization of risk". When a bank gives a loan, it takes a
risk. The feature of the present "model" however is to pass the risk on
to somebody else, who in turn passes it on to somebody else, and so on,
until it is not even clear who bears the risk. We thus have layers and
layers of financial institutions between the ultimate "lender", whose
identity even gets progressively more and more blurred, and the
borrower, rather like under the "Permanent Settlement" system in Bengal
where there were layers and layers of intermediaries between the
cultivator and the zamindar. An additional element of socialization of
risk, which is of great importance in the case of third world borrowers,
is getting the government to guarantee such loans implicitly or
explicitly, even when such loans are incurred by the private sector.
Effectively then, international finance capital insulates itself against
risks and ensures for</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>Social Scientist</I></B></P>
 
<P>itself a fat rate of return at the expense of the hapless third world
people whose taxes go to cover any potential loss to such capital.</P>

<P>Shireen Moosvi's Presidential Address to the Medieval India section
of the Indian History Congress held recently at Bareily is not only a
magisterial survey, drawing on both historical and historiographical
material, of the State in Indian history, but also in particular a
critique of several current ideas on the subject ranging from the
perception of the Subaltern Studies group to the theory of the
"Segmentary State". Just as there was a tendency at one stage to deny
the role of class-struggle in Indian history by invoking inter alia the
theory of the Asiatic Mode of Production, likewise there is a parallel
tendency to deny the existence of the institution of the State, such as
prevailed elsewhere, in Indian history. Moosvi joins issue with the
range of writings that propagate this tendency.</P>

<P>Notwithstanding the lead provided by none other than Jadunath Sarkar,
military history has been one of the neglected areas in Indian
historical research, and in particular, the history of the material
weapons of warfare. It is gratifying therefore that Iqtidar Alam Khan,
one of our eminent and senior historians, has been interested in this
area in the context of medieval India. We publish a paper by him, which
is based on research enshrined in a recent book and which was also
presented at the Bareily session of the Indian History Congress, to
bring to our readers a flavour of this subject.</P>

<P>Finally, we publish a piece by Ajanta Biswas on S.G.Deuskar, the
firebrand revolutionary of Maharashtrian origin who was domiciled in
Bengal and wrote trenchant critiques of British colonial rule around the
time of the Swadeshi movement. Deuskar's role in the anti-colonial
struggle has not received its due recognition. We are glad therefore to
publish this piece.</P>
