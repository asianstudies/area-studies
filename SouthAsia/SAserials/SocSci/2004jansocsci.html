<P>Editorial Note</P>

<P>The practical attack on our secular polity by the <I>Hindutva</I>
forces has been accompanied by a parallel attack in the realm of ideas
by a number of intellectuals, not necessarily aligned with the
<I>Hindutva</I> forces, on the concept of secularism itself on the
grounds that it is an imported "Western" concept. Secularism in the
sense of a separation of religion from the State, it is argued, is a
part of the European tradition, while the appropriate concept in the
Indian context, consistent with "our tradition", is respect for all
religions (<I>sarva dharma samabhava</I>). The latter, no matter how
benign it may sound, constitutes, however, the thin end of the communal
wedge: it entails, instead of a separation, a conflation of religion
with the State, which, apart from being <I>socially</I> retrograde (e.g.
on questions of caste and women's rights), cannot but pave the way for a
conflation of the <I>majority</I> religion with the State. In defence of
their argument, the proponents of this alternative view of a so-called
"<I>sui generis</I> Indianstyle secularism" often invoke the authority
of Gandhiji, whose inclination towards this view is alleged to have been
subverted by the Nehruvian and Leftist predilection for the borrowed
Western concept.</P>

<P>We are glad to publish in this context the lead article by Professor
Bipan Chandra, the eminent historian of modern India who traces with
great care the evolution of Gandhiji's id eas on secularism and shows
that Gandhiji too was a subscriber to the modern, and so-called
"Western", concept of secularism, entailing a complete separation of
religion from the State.</P>

<P>The term "historicism" is used in two very different, and even
diametrically opposite senses, one in the Popperian sense, and the other
in the sense of "Western Marxism". While the Popperian critique of
"historicism" is by now <I>passe</I>, much debate has occurred within
and around the Marxist tradition on "historicism" in the second sense,
i.e. in the sense of a "historicist" interpretation of Marxism. Even
critiques of Marxism such as Maurice MerleauPonty's in his <I>Adventures
of the Dialectic</I> take Marxism to be essentially "historicist", while
Louis Althusscr, the famous Marxist philosopher, considered historicism
to be only a variant of empiricism. Prabhat Patnaik's article, while
going over this ground,</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>argues that the very concept of a People's Democratic Revolution,
which Marxism considers to be on the historical agenda in third world
societies, necessarily entails the acceptance of a non-historicist
interpretation of Marxism.  Like Moliere's Monsieur Jourdan speaking
prose without knowing it, we have in other words implicitly rejected
historicism all along without always knowing it.</P>

<P>Both these articles, by Professor Bipan Chandra and by Prabhat
Patnaik, are due to appear shortly in a <I>Festshrift</I> for Professor
Sukumari Bhattacharya the distinguished historian of ancient India who
has also been a frequent contributor to <I>Social Scientist</I> and whom
we hold in high esteem. We are grateful to the editors of that
forthcoming volume for allowing us to bring out these articles in our
journal in advance of the publication of that volume, and use this
opportunity for paying our own homage to Professor Bhattacharya.</P>

<P>The elimination of child labour must occupy a pre-eminent position in
any agenda for social change. In India while there has been a decline in
child labour over the last several years, according to the National
Sample Survey data, this decline has slowed down in the nineties.
Moreover even such decline as occurred in the nineties has to be seen in
the context of generally declining employment opportunities in this
period, so that the perceived decline in child labour may well be a
reflection of higher child unemployment rates. We have in short a very
long way to go in achieving this basic social objective, as Shakti Kak's
article argues. Kak uses NSS data to provide a picture of the magnitude
and profile of child labour in India in the 1990s, which can be of great
use in devising ways to overcome this problem.</P>

<P>Finally we publish an obituary on Krishna Raj, the renowned editor of
the <I>Economic and Political Weekly</I>, who passed away in January,
written by Govind Deshpande who has been a long-standing contributor and
columnist of that journal. The editorial board of <I>Social
Scientist</I> joins me in expressing our condolences over his death.</P>
