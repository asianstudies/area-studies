                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least twenty persons belonging to the tribal population 
                  of Rayagada district of Orissa have died from eating mango kernels. 
                  The Orissa administration, from the Chief Minister downwards, 
                  insists that these are not starvation deaths, since mango kernels 
                  are habitually consumed by the tribals anyway. They may be right. 
                  What constitutes starvation death being a matter of definition, 
                  these deaths may not fall under that rubric. But, the fact that 
                  more than half a century after independence a significant part 
                  of the population of this country has to survive on mango kernels 
                  is a matter of national shame. The fact that this happens even 
                  in a situation where over fifty million tonnes of foodgrains 
                  are rotting in government godowns is not just shameful; it is 
                  criminal.</P>
				  
                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called "economic liberalization", which has entailed 
                  drastic cuts in government expenditure in rural areas, and hence 
                  curtailed even the limited purchasing power that used to come 
                  into the hands of the rural poor, is of course the immediate 
                  reason behind this state of acute misery. But there is something 
                  more. The baleful effects of "liberalization" are superimposed 
                  on a base which is quite intolerable anyway.</P>
				  
                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should such intolerable living conditions, greatly aggravated 
                  no doubt by "liberalization", exist at all? Paradoxically, India's 
                  record in this respect is abysmal even compared to countries 
                  of East and South East Asia, despite the fact that in many of 
                  those countries the poor scarcely had any political rights for 
                  long stretches of time, while India has continuously had universal 
                  adult franchise for the last fifty years. To say that this is 
                  because average growth rates in those countries were higher 
                  than in India is nonsense. Growth rates as such have little 
                  bearing on poverty: the state of the rural poor in India for 
                  instance has become worse if anything during the nineties when 
                  the country's growth rate has allegedly accelerated.</P>
				  
                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is perhaps inescapable that India's uniquely 
                  oppressive, caste-ridden, social structure prevents a distribution 
                  of the means of consumption with anything like the degree of 
                  equality achievable in other Asian countries. And the reaction 
                  of the Orissa administration to the allegations of starvation 
                  deaths reveals unwittingly the nauseating contempt in which 
                  the tribal population</P>
				  
                <P>[++Page 2 <I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I>]</P>
				
                <P>is held by the establishment: it is almost suggested that the 
                  tribals are stupid enough to prefer mango kernels to rice; so, 
                  if they die in the process then what can anyone do? "Liberalization" 
                  which has vastly increased inequalities over the last decade 
                  gets nourishment precisely from this soil.</P>
				  
                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lead article by Bhairabi 
                  Prasad Sahu in the current number of <I>Social Scientist</I>, 
                  while arguing for a change of perspective in the writing of 
                  Indian history, makes, in passing, a point similar to the one 
                  above. He sees the Brahmanical ideology as supporting the "caste 
                  land-power pyramid" which denied property rights in land to 
                  "the untouchables": they remained landless labourers despite 
                  land abundance in the country.</P>

                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paradoxically they continue to remain landless 
                  labourers (predominantly), even half a century after independence. 
                  Radical land reforms which could have dealt a blow to this uniquely 
                  oppressive system were eschewed. The bourgeoisie's compromise 
                  with landlordism contained within itself the prospects not only 
                  of a cul <I>de-sac</I> for the path of development being pursued, 
                  but also, as Krishna Ananth argues in his piece, of a fascist 
                  threat, such as what we are witnessing today.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saadat Hasan Manto's partition stories are moving, powerful, 
and stunningly evocative of the frenzy of the times. They constitute 
some of the finest examples of creative writing in the subcontinent in 
modern times. Alok Bhalla in his piece shows why Khalid Hasan's 
English translation of these stories, which has been much praised, is 
in fact "too weak and sentimental, partisan and censorious" to do 
justice to Manto, to reveal his true significance to us.</P>

                <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Margit Koves discusses the anthropology 
                  in the aesthetics of the young Lukacs, taking four of his works: 
                  <I>Diary, The History and Development of Modern Drama, Soul 
                  and Form</I>, and T<I>heory of the Novel</I>. She also discusses 
                  how Lukacs' philosophy developed from being subject-centred 
                  to acquiring a being-centred character.</P> 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we publish the text of Manim Chatterjee's Pritilata 
Wadedar memorial lecture, delivered earlier this year at Jadavpur 
University, Calcutta, where she argues that 1930 marked a watershed 
in the participation of women in the freedom struggle, in both its 
Gandhian and revolutionary forms.</P>
