<P>Editorial Note</P>

<P>Among alternative varieties of fascism, the variety currently
burgeoning in India has one <I>sui generis</I> quality, which is its
obsession with rewriting history. The reason lies in its essentially
<I>comprador</I> character: its pusillanimity <I>vis a vis</I>
imperialism forces it to locate its "superiority" myth, which
incidentally is common to all varieties of fascism, in the hoary old
past, in fact several millennia before Christ. Sustaining this myth
therefore necessarily requires a rewriting of history in a way that the
myths propagated by the other varieties of fascism did not require. The
myth of "Aryan superiority" could simply be asserted; the myth of
"<I>Hindutva</I> superiority" requires by contrast a tampering with the
chronology of ancient Indian history. Indian historians, among whom are
some of the finest practitioners of the craft anywhere in the world,
have, to their credit, stoutly resisted this officially-sponsored
attempt to pervert their discipline by the ideological upstarts of
<I>Hindutva</I>. We are happy therefore to publish in the current issue
of <I>Social Scientist</I> a number of papers, by noted historians of
the country, which were presented at the last session of the Indian
History Congress, held at Bhopal. We hope that our readers would get
from this sample of papers a flavour of the ongoing historical research
in the country.</P>

<P>The Hindutva protagonists have been endorsing the view that the
Harappan civilization was Vedic and Aryan. This view however is
untenable for an obvious reason, namely that the mature Harappan culture
is dated around 2500-2000 BC while most scholars date the <I>Rg Veda</I>
later than 2000 sc. The Hindutva protagonists overcome this difficulty
by pushing back the <I>Rg Veda</I> to a much earlier period, though this
claim goes against the overwhelming weight of available evidence.
R.S.Sharma, in the lead article of this issue, revisits this question of
the Aryan nature of Harappan civilization, and, concentrating
exclusively on the lexical and archaeological evidence, shows that
generally the markers of Harappan culture do not appear in the <I>Rg
Veda</I> and vice versa. Of particular interest in this context is
Sharma's discussion of the Munda presence in the Harappan area, and the
survival, even to this day, of Munda words in the Punjabi language. So
fascinating is this whole discussion that one feels tempted to request
historians to put on the research agenda an exploration of

<P>p. 2	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>the Santhal roots of the Indian civilization, rather in the manner of
Martin Bernal's <I>Black Athena</I> which threw light on the
Afro-Asiatic roots of classical European civilization.</P>

<P>Two papers on medieval India throw light, each in its own way, on the
alchemy of the process through which the idea of India came to be
formed. Akbar and Dara Shukoh were two outstanding Mughal princes who
contributed to this process. Shireen Moosvi discusses the lite of
"Jadrup" a name that appears in <I>A' in-i-Akbari</I> and a name that
she identifies with Chitrarupa, an ascetic through whom the Mughals came
to know about Vedantic philosophy in its. pantheistic form. Tasadduq
Husain explores the spiritual journey of Dara Shukoh, a rational thinker
who, while claiming to be a true Muslim, rejected the sectarian Islam of
the Ulema.</P>

<P>The partition, a major setback for the idea of India, continues to
haunt us. Underlying questions like "Could it have been avoided?" "What
went wrong? ", underlying endless discussions about the role of this or
that leader, underlying speculations over whether this or that remark of
some prominent leader really turned the tide, and underlying the fresh,
raw memory of the suffering, the trauma, and the brutality that
accompanied the partition, is the Tact that we, the people of the
subcontinent, have been singularly unable even after more than half a
century to transcend that event, to seule scores with that past.
Mushirul Hasan's paper on Partition Themes, which is the text of his
Presidential Address to the Modern India section of the Indian History
Congress, is a sparkling and evocative discussion of this epochal
event.</P>

<P>Finally we publish a paper on the theme relating to imperialism and
the economic order it is busy imposing on the oppressed humanity. The
paper emphasizes in particular the ideological obfuscation which is an
integral part of imperial dominance. Kristoffel Lieten talks about the
hollowness and seductiveness of the post-modern and postdevelopment
position.</P></FONT>
