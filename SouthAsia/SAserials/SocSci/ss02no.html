<P>Editorial Note</P>

<P>The current number of <I>Social Scientist</I> is concerned largely
with issues relating to "globalization". The lead article by Prabhat
Patnaik raises the question: if "globalization" is driven by a new form
of international finance capital which does not bear the stamp of its
national origin the way finance capital in Lenin's time did, and if this
fact undermines the <I>isolated</I> sovereignty of the individual
nation-States in crucial ways, then what is the new form of capitalist
State-system that is emerging in this new epoch? He detects a tendency
for the emergence of a global imperialist dictatorship, not replacing
the existing nation-States but superimposed upon them, through a process
of appropriation of sovereignty from the States upon which it is
superimposed. The tendency towards such a State-system which would be in
conformity with the new form of international capital, has got greatly
strengthened, according to him, in the aftermath of September 11, 2001,
as a consequence of the so-called global war on terrorism.</P>

<P> Two points made by him in this context are noteworthy: first, this
emerging State-system is altogether <I>sui generis</I>. It is very
different from the concepts of "super-imperialism" and
"ultra-imperialism" with which we are familiar, the difference
consisting, among other things, in the fact that important segments of
the bourgeoisie in the third world itself are happy with such an
arrangement. The second point is that authoritarianism in this scenario
inheres not only in the hegemonic metropolitan power but also in the
third world nationState which constitutes a part of the total
State-system.  The enactment of laws like POTA which give the domestic
nation-State sweeping powers are pointers in this direction.</P>

<P>Jayati Ghosh's essay deals with a whole range of issues, including in
particular the impact of the processes unleashed by "globalization" on
women's employment. There is a view that the policies associated with
"globalization" have a favourable impact on women's</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>employment: since women can be employed on "flexible" terms there is
much demand for their labour when the need is to be competitive in a
world of "liberalized" trade. Ghosh raises three questions in this
regard: first, women constitute the more easily dispensable section of
the labour force, so that when there is any overall shrinking in
employment opportunities, as happens with the deflationary measures
associated with "neo-liberal" policies, they are the first to lose their
jobs. Secondly, apart from this macro-effect, it is not even clear that
the shift in the composition of activities that occurs with
"neo-liberal" policies works to the advantage of women. No doubt certain
kinds of export activities favour women's employment, but women's
representation being less in the skill-intensive sectors they lose out
from the shift in favour of such activities; moreover when women's
employment rise, the wage-gap between women and men tends to get reduced
which acts as an automatic check on any continuous increase in women's
employment. She gives a wealth of data from third world countries to
establish her propositions whose impressive range and sweep should
appeal to readers.</P>

<P>The third paper by Annelies Zoomers while dealing with the entire
question of rural development policy in Latin America has several
important things to say about the impact of "neo-liberal" policies on
agriculture. While the claim on behalf of such policies is that they
open up export opportunities for agriculture and rectify the depressed
domestic terms of trade for this sector that prevail under
<I>dirigisme</I>, both of which benefit the entire countryside, the
Latin American experience does not bear these claims out. In fact in
most of these countries the opportunities provided by export agriculture
have been cornered by a few large producers, while the
<I>minifundistas</I>, unable to benefit from lucrative export
opportunities but squeezed by higher input prices and the withdrawal of
government support, have witnessed reduced incomes and growing
poverty.</P> </FONT>
