<P>Introduction
by <A HREF="#praveen"><B>Praveen Jha*</B></A></P>

<P>A seminar on "Alternatives before India in the Context of
Globalization" was organized jointly by <I>Social Scientist</I> and the
Gadgil Birth Centenary Committee on September 14-15, 2002, to
commemorate the late Professor D.R. Gadgil's vision and contribution as
an economist. The present and the next issue of <I>Social Scientist</I>
carry the papers presented at the said seminar.</P>

<P>As is well known, Professor D.R. Gadgil's was a very significant
voice in several of the economic discussions and debates that unfolded
in India after independence from the British rule. In fact, even before
independence he had come to be recognized as a front-ranking economist
and his M.Litt. thesis, which was published in 1924 under the title of
T<I>he Industrial Evolution of India in Recent Times</I>, enjoys the
status of a classic in the literature on modern Indian economic history.
After completing his university education at Cambridge, England, he
returned to India in 1923 and began his professional career in the
Finance Department of the Government of Bombay. Soon after, in 1925, he
took over as the principal of the MTB College at Surat, where he stayed
for five years. In 1930, Gadgil became the first Director of the newly
founded Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, an institution that
he nurtured with remarkable care and vision until his retirement in
1966. Apart from providing most distinguished guidance to this
institution, Gadgil was quite active in many of the economic debates,
particularly around the strategy of planning, that unfolded in post-1947
India; in several of these, either he was very much within the ring or
was a ringsider, beginning with the membership of Economists' Panel set
up in 1955, to the Deputy Chairmanship of the Planning Commission
between 1967 and 1971, a post he relinquished a day before he passed
away on 3 May 1971. As Sulabha Brahme mentions in her brief note, Gadgil
was an institution builder in a broader sense, as he tried to put his
ideas into practice through a range of activities. Among these, his
efforts to put in place a system of cooperative rural credit
institutions and cooperative sugar factories in Maharashtra have been
hailed as very significant experiments.</P>

<P>Gadgil was a prolific writer with a vast spectrum of intellectual
concerns and a good deal of his energies was devoted to issues of
economic development with reference to Maharashtra. However, the primary
motivation behind all his</P>

<P><I><B>Page 2</B></I></P>

<P>intellectual efforts was the humanistic conviction that the purpose
of economics is not simply to serve the interests of the powers that be,
but to endeavour to improve the lives of the masses. Thus, issues like
tenancy and land reform, rural indebtedness, unemployment and poverty
were at the core of Gadgil's vision as an economist.</P>

<P>As is well-known, the neo-liberal agenda that has dominated the
official economic policy discourse and practice in India since the early
1990s has tried to denigrate and marginalize the above noted humanistic
conviction. The negative consequences of such a paradigmatic shift are
all too visible, and even some of the addicts of neoliberalism have come
to acknowledge, although grudgingly, distressing developments such as
the dramatic deceleration in employment generation and decline in food
security in recent years.</P>

<P>Participants at the seminar who came together to commemorate Gadgil's
contributions share his vision that economic policy should be guided by
the aspirations of establishing a humane society. They also share the
view that neoliberalism fundamentally militates against such
aspirations, and have been engaged in mapping out the alternatives
relevant to the overall macroeconomic policy regime as well as to the
different spheres of the Indian economy, at the present conjuncture.</P>

<P>This issue of <I>Social Scientist</I> begins with a briet
introductory note on D. R. Gadgil by his daughter, and eminent scholar,
Sulabha Brahme, and contains five of the twelve substantive papers
presented at the above noted seminar. For logistical reasons, one of the
twelve papers by Utsa Patnaik, has appeared in the July-August issue of
<I>Social Scientist</I> and the remaining papers not included here will
be published in the next issue.</P>

<P>Three of the five papers here, by Prabhat Patnaik, Nasir Tyabji and
D.  Raghunandan, relate to issues of technological change, contours of
alternative technology strategy, self-reliance, and science in the
public domain. The other two papers, by Madhura Swaminathan and Jayati
Ghosh relate to food policy and the external sector respectively. Each
of these papers is a very substantive contribution and it would not be
appropriate to try and summarise them. Suffice it to note that what we
have here is some of the most serious engagements in search of
alternatives.</P>
