Editorial Note<p>

The proposition that free trade is beneficial for all countries is
central to mainstream bourgeois economics. It is invoked in support of
both the structural adjustment programmes prescribed by the Bretton
Woods institutions for the Third World, and the new world trading order
being ushered in through the VITO. The theoretical justification for
this proposition was provided originally by David Ricardo through a
celebrated example. He considered trade between England and Portugal and
showed that even if one of the countries could produce both cloth and
wine cheaply, i.e. had an absolute advantage in the production of both
goods, nonetheless, if their <i>relative advantage</i> in the production
of the two goods differed, then each would be better off by specialising
in the production of the good for which it was better suited and
exchanging it for the other good.<p>

	Ricardo never once explained <i>why</i> countries differed in
their relative advantages. Subsequent attempts to re-establish the
Ricardian proposition have invoked the concept of factor endowments to
explain why countries' relative capacities might differ; but this is an
absurd proposition since the relative factor endowments, which include
the magnitude of capital stock, are not fixed but change through
economic policy, including trade policy, so that a policy of free trade
has no independent anchorage. Utsa Patnaik in her E.M.S. Namboodiripad
Memorial Lecture, which we publish as the lead article in the current
number of <i>Social Scientist</i>, provides a powerful critique of
Ricardo's proposition along altogether novel lines, namely that
Ricardo's example itself was fraudulent: England was incapable of
producing wine while Portugal was capable of producing both wine and
cloth. His theory built upon a false premise serves as an apologetic for
the colonial pattern of international division of labour which once
again is being sought to be imposed on the Third World today. So
pathetic however is the state of our intellectual life, so steeped in a
comprador ethos, that these imperialist theoretical constructs are
uncritically accepted by us and figure freely in our own discussions.<p>

++Page 2  SOCIAL SCIENTIST<p>

	The paper by Kristoffel Lieten deals with yet another
theoretical justification which is advanced in favour of structural
adjustment, namely that it would bring large inflows of direct foreign
investment into the Third World under the aegis of the multinational
corporations and thereby enable them to break out of their backwardness.
Lieten marshals a host of evidence to show that the MNCs have not been,
and can not be expected to be, the "battering rams" for breaking down
the barriers of backwardness. Indeed wherever significant development
has taken place within the Third World, it has occurred mainly on the
basis of internal resources and through the strategic intervention by
the Third World state.<p>

	Atis Dasgupta's paper traces the historical background to the
emergence of ethnic tensions in the Darjeeling hills and the demand for
a separate state of Gorkhaland. While the formation of an autonomous
Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council was an innovative step taken by the Left
Front government of West Bengal, the unsatisfactory performance of the
Council under the GNLF has once again fanned the flames of ethnic
exclusiveness and revived the demand for a separate state. Dasgupta
underscores the destructive potential of any such agitation for the
economy of the region and argues forcefully that only a combination of
class struggle and further democratic devolution of power to the people
can succeed in meeting the genuine grievances of the people of the hill
region.<p>

	Finally we publish a rejoinder by Prasenjit Bose to the review
article of Javeed Alam on the Leftword Books publication A World to Win
which had appeared in our special number on the Communist Manifesto. We
would welcome further discussion on the several issues raised by Alam in
his review article.
