<b>Editoial Note</b>

<p> In the previous issue of <I>Social Scientist</I> we had published
three papers presented at the 61st session of the Indian History
Congress, including the inaugural address by Amartya Sen. In the current
number we are publishing three more papers presented at the same
Congress. The reason for our apparent obsession with History Congress
papers has nothing to do either with any partiality on our part towards
this particular discipline, or with any paucity of publishable material
at our disposal, or with any apprehension that these papers would
otherwise not see the light of day (the History Congress no doubt has
its own programme of publication). The reason lies in the fact that at
this juncture in our national life, debates on history have assumed a
crucial significance. With the Sangh Parivar using the State machinery
(and the gigantic patronage system that the State machinery places at
its command) to push aggressively a communal-fascist interpretation of
Indian history, it becomes essential for us to use our journal to combat
this project. This does not simply mean publishing articles that oppose
the Sangh Parivar's point of view; it entails above all promoting
rigorous scientific historical research. The Sangh Parivar's history is
not just communal-fascist; it fails to meet rigorous standards of
scientific scholarship.</p>

<P>The three papers from the History Congress which we are motivated by
these considerations to publish in the current number are by Suvira
Jaiswal, Vjay Nath and P.K.Shukla. Suvira Jaiswal's paper on female
images in the <I>Arthasastra</I>, while painting a vivid picture of a
patriarchal society, also provides an idea of the various options
available to women at the time. One striking option, according to
<I>Arthasastra</I> evidence, which appears to have been exercised by
many women is to become wandering ascetics.</P>

<P>Vijay Nath's paper is the text of his Presidential address to the
Ancient India section of the History Congress. He draws a distinction
between Brahmanism and Puranic Hinduism, the latter entailing a masive
process of acculturation through which the pre-existing tribal
population was assimilated. It is not only the assimilation of tribal
deities, but the institutionalisation of a whole range of familiar
practices - from the puja form of worship, to the erection of temples,
to the sanctification of certain places as tirthas, to collective
readings</P>

<B><P>2	SOCIAL SCIENTIST</P></B>

<P>of the <I>Puranas</I> under the guidance of a guru - which lead to
the popularisation and spread of "Hinduism" of this form at the expense
of other competing religions. The need to get tribal labour for
agricultural work on lands granted to Brahmins in outlying regions
inhabited by tribes may have been the stimulus behind the emergence and
promotion of this Puranic Hinduism.</P>

<P>P.K.Shukla underscores the social harmony and sense of togetherness
between the Hindus and the Muslims that characterised the medieval
period of our history. An interesting index of this is the fact that
over a span of hundred years, i.e. during the eighteenth century, there
were only four recorded cases of communal  "commotion" which could not
even be called "riots". He traces the role of colonial historiography,
starting from James Mill, in painting our history in communal
colours.</P>

<P>The rest of the issue is made up, apart from Sudhir Chandra's
fascinating review article on a biography of Brahmabandhab Upadhyay, of
Prabhat Patnaik's Ansari memorial lecture at Jamia Millia Islamia, and
of the renowned Urdu author Anwer Azeem's obituary tribute, written in
1955, on Manto. Patnaik takes up the proposition, first articulated at
the Sixth Congress of the Comintern and subsequently developed by Paul
Baran, that a successful diffusion of industrial capitalism from the
first to the third world is not possible. While the experience of East
and South-east Asia appeared for a while to have discredited this
proposition (and the proponents of globalisation under the aegis of
imperialism keep asserting this), a new phase of capitalism is upon us,
according to Patnaik, whose inner logic once again validates this
proposition. In other words, not only are no more South Korean or
Malaysian "miracles" possible, but even those countries would not be
able to retain the positions they had attained in their respective
periods of prosperity.</P>

<P>Anwer Azeem the progressive Urdu writer was in Moscow during the mid-
50s when he wrote this tribute in the wake of Manto's death. In it,
while defending Manto against conservative attacks, he provides a
critical evaluation of Manto's work that is of great interest. This
valuable document has not been available till now in English
translation. We publish a translation essayed by his wife and son after
his death on October 20, 2000.</P>
