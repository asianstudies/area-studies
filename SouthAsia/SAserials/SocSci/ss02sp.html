<P>Introduction</P>

<P>This issue of the <I>Social Scientist</I> brings to its readers
contributions related to on-going research. Rohan D'Souza's article
examines aspects related to the decline of the Ottoman, Safavid and the
Mughal empires, through a comparative perspective. Besides noting some
commonalties associated with the way they operated with similar
property, administrative mechanisms and institutions of rule, he
delineates how a crisis haunted them when 'their main instrument of
coercion i.e. cavalry warfare' became outmoded. Advocating primacy to
this aspect, he acknowledges other features such as demographic
pressure, climatic factors and the price revolution of the seventeenth,
which hastened the pace of the decline.</P>

<P>Mridula Ramanna examines the history of public health in the Bombay
Presidency on the basis of a critical evaluation of the role of Florence
Nightingale. Besides, examining sectors like sanitation (that included
village sanitation) and nursing schemes taken up by Nightingale, Ramanna
highlights her role in voicing diverse health concerns of colonial
Bombay Presidency at the International Congress on Hygiene and
Demography, 1891. Nevertheless, as pointed out, certain contradictions
remained in her method, which accepted colonialism as a 'given' fact.
Lata Singh's contribution explores the margins of resistance associated
with the Non Co-operation Movement in Bihar. She cautions us about the
need to look beyond simplistic categorisations that locate subordinate
sections of the constabulary only as an agency of the colonial state.
Focusing on their struggles and conflicts with the colonial order, Singh
delineates how this was conditioned by the specificities of the problems
affecting them and the anti-colonial movement sweeping Bihar during the
Non Co-operation Movement.</P>

<P>Brigitte Schulze looks at the problems associated with the
establishment of the genre of 'national cinema', with India becoming</P>

<P>free in 1947. She focuses on Mahboob Khan's 'Mother India' and the
way it created a major cinematic myth - that of the widespread
effectiveness of 'Nehruvian socialism'. She critiques the way the film
projects Indian womanhood, that is equated with sacrifice and suffering.
In this manner, the author argues that 'Mother India' marks a rather
regressive nationalist resolution of the 'woman question', wherein it
not only failed to confront patriarchy but also accepted and
strengthened many of the negative 'givens' of Indian society.</P>
