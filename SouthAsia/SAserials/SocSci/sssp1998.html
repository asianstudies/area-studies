<b><a name="edit">Editorial Note</a></b><p>

Aijaz Ahmad's Ved Gupta Memorial Lecture, which we publish as the lead
article of the current number of <i>Social Scientist</i>, is remarkable <i>inter alia</i> for
its uninhibited use of the term 'fascist' to describe the Hindutva brand of
ideology and politics. He uses the terms, of course, in a somewhat supple
and wideranging sense. The origin of 'fascism' in this sense is traced to the
1880s which marked the emergence of m odern imperialism on the one hand,
and of mass working-class parties on the other; and its 
project is seen as the
will to fashion 'an anti-materialist conception of revolution, anti-liberal 
conception of nationalism, anti -rationalist critique of Modernity, 
anti-humanist assaults on the politics of liberation, in a rhetoric 
of 'Nood and belonging', and in the name 
of a glorious past that never was'. The ideologies
covered under the rubric of 'fascism' are marked by the fact that they too are
dedicated to making their own kind of revolution, that is, revolutions of the
Far Right.<p>

Ahmad's paper, which is a remarkable <i>tour de force</i>, raises, however, a
number of questions. Of these, only the following two can, be mentioned
here: first, while fascism as a marginal tendency may exist in society for a
long time, it becomes a force to reckon with only in certain historical 
conjunctures; can we not then say that a more contextualised characterisation
of fascism (which focusses on the class-situatlon that propels it to hegemony),
such as what the Comintern under Dirrutrov had provided, would be more
useful for praxis than a characterization in terms either of the movement's
own proclaimed objectives and self-perceptions, or of its 
general and unvarying features such as its 'Culture of 
cruelty'? This question is important
because it points to the way the fascist prograin-le changes to cope with the 
conjuncture.<p>

Secondly, can we treat fascism in the advanced countries and fascism in
the third world as identical (or similar) entities, simply because of their 
obvious common features? What, for instance, is the relationship 
between thirdworld fascism and imperialism? In particular, can a fascist regime establish
itself in the third world without the blessings of imperialism? If it cannot
(and it is instructive that the Khomemi regime, which had all the features of
a fascist regime except the blessings of imperialism, could not last long),
then the contextualised characterisation of third-world fascism has to be
inade taking this aspect too into consideration.<p>

This second question is important for answering a number of more 
specific questions: for example, is fascism in third-world countries like India an
offshoot of anti-colonialism (a segment of the anti-colomal national 
movement being imbued with a fascist character), or is it a force independent of,
and opposed to, the anti-colonial national movement, a force which 
develops an altogether different concept of the 'nation': not in opposition to 

[<b>++Page 2 Social Scientist</b>] 

imperialism but in opposition to some hapless domestic minority? The Indian 
experience would suggest the later perspective on fascism: even though
the Congress-led national movement had substantial communal elements
within it, the RSS, the core of the Hindutva movement, was never a part of
any anti-colonial struggle. (And even Savarkar of the Hindu Mahasabha
who began as a fighter against colonialism ended up meekly compromising
with it). Likewise, should one accept the imperialist characterization of the
Milosevic regime as 'fascist', notwithstanding whatever odious policies it
might have pursued, when it is engaged in such a significant anti-imperialist
struggle?<p>

Questions such as these need to be debated at length in Marxist circles,
and urgently. It is the great merit of Ahmad's article that it initiates such a
debate in a forthright manner.<p>

K.M. Shrimali's paper highlights the attempt being made in our country
to obliterate a pluralistic cultural heritage under the banner of cultural 
nationalism. It also draws attention to the significant fact that such attempts
are occurring elsewhere as well and are not necessarily confined to the fascist
groups alone, though the latter tend to be the chief source of inspiration
behind such attempts. Even the European Union has been lavishly funding
campaigns with chauvinistic overtones. The complementary paper by D.N.
Jha makes meticulous use of historical evidence to destroy several communal
myths, such as the claim for instance that the 'Muslims' were destroyers of
'Hindu' temples and that they converted 'Hindus' to Islam by force.<p>

Between December 28, 1998, and January 1, 1999, 
SAHMAT had organised a five-day convention and 
festival on secular cultural action, which was
attended by activists from other South Asian countries as well as from the
Indian diaspora. We carry a report on that important event by Mira
Rosenthal.<p>
