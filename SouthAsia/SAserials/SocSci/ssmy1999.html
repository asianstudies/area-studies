<b><a name="edit">Editorial Note</a></b><p>

One of Michael Kalecki's great insights was to see the distinction between capitalism and
socialism as one between a demand-constrained system and a supply-constrained system, an idea
that was later used, though in an altogether different way, by the Hungarian economist Janos
Kornai. Kalecki's own work, together with Keynes', prepared the intellectual ground for state
intervention in demand management in capitalist economies, because of which it did appear for a
while in the fifties and the early sixties (when unemployment rates in metropolitan economies
were extremely low) as if capitalism too, in its new incarnation, had become metamorphosed into
a supply-constrained system. But with the emergence of internationally-mobile finance capital in
the form of "hot money" flows, the capacity of "nation-states" even in the metropolitan countries
to prop up the level of aggregate demand has dwindled. Capitalism has recaptured its old
character of being demand-constrained. And this character is imposed upon the backward
economies as well through the policies of "liberalisation-cum-structural adjustment" enforced on
them.<p>

     This proposition underlies the argument of Prabhat Patnaik in the lead article of the
current number of <i>Social Scientist</i>. He cites some evidence to show how the Indian economy in
the nineties has got transformed into a demand-constrained system.<p>

     M.Raghavan's paper on the rice economy, while discussing the growth and distribution of
rice in India, raises certain deep issues of development strategy. Should the production of
important commodities be widely located, or should there be regional specialisation? While
conventional "efficiency" considerations would favour regional specialisation, a host of other
considerations such as the need for local self-sufficiency (which may be necessary for "security"
in certain cases) would favour dispersion. But if "efficiency" 

[<b>++Page 2  <i>Social Scientist</i></b>] 

arguments win the day and regional specialisation is favoured, then the whole question of the
price which the surplus region extracts from the deficit region acquires paramount importance.
Specialisation can easily become a mechanism through which one part of the country extracts a
surplus from another, a phenomenon whose possibility as well as undesirability are heightened
when the commodity in question is an essential component of mass consumption. Raghavan
argues that we have not been sufficiently cognisant of this scenario and the potential conflict
inherent in it in the post-Green Revolution period when the production, and above all the
marketable surplus, of crucial crops like rice have become geographically more concentrated.<p>

     Kumkum Sangari's paper, in providing an analytical critique of the anti-conversion
campaign, necessarily addresses itself to a whole range of issues regarding law and society,
citizenship, patriarchy and the State. These are issues on which the Left, the secular forces, and
the women's movement have been attempting to attain clarity. Sangari's paper is both a reflection
of and a major contribution towards that attempt. She draws attention to the pervasiveness of the
phenomenon of "partial conversions" which tend to create overlapping religious networks, and
alter relationships both between and within belief systems. Differences in other words are not
absolutised but produce what she calls "inauthenticity". This inauthenticity is a condition of
genuine religious plurality. It must be defended both against the designs of the Hindu Right and
against State legislation.<p>

Book Review<p>

Peasant Movement in Bihar</b><p>

Kaushal Kishore Sharma, Prabhakar Prasad Singh, Ranjan Kumar (eds.), <i>Peasant Struggle in
Bihar, 1831-1942: Spontaneity to Organisation</i>, pp. xvii + 251, Patna, 1994, Price Rs 325.<p>

This is an anthology of eighteen essays on socio-political struggles of the Bihar peasantry during
the last one and a half century. They are uneven in quality and disparate as well, as such the
collection lacks a clearly identifiable central theme or a conceptual framework. The editors have,
however, tried to provide a semblance of a central theme - "spontaneity to organisation" - by
arranging the essays in such a chronological sequence so as to give a broad idea of the character
of successive phases of these struggles. The essays are on historiography, spontaneous and
organised phases of peasant struggles during the colonial era, their relationship with Indian
nationalism, and finally their characteristic transformations in the post-colonial period.<p>

     The collection starts with M.N. Karn's "Peasant Movements in Bihar: A Trend Analysis"
wherein the writer, on the basis of some of his earlier studies sets out to analyse the nature and
character of the Bihar peasants' struggles in the 19th and the 20th centuries but his approach is
very selective. He selects only the 19th century tribal uprisings in the Chotanagpur division and
the 20th century agrarian conflicts in central Bihar making his "trend analysis" a lopsided
exercise. Prabhakar Prasad Singh's "Peasant Awakening and Historiography in Bihar", though
good in itself, is hardly relevant to the theme of the anthology. His occasional references to Bihar
have probably been made to validate its inclusion in this collection. J.C. Jha's two articles, one on
the historiography of the tribal movements  

[<b><i>Social Scientist</i>,  p. 87</b>]

and the other on the nature of Kol and the Bhumij revolts are well-written, informative and
concise; and they can usefully serve as a primer to the readers with anthropological interests. But
such readers may very well be surprised at the omission in this collection of any account of the
Santhal <i>hool</i> and Munda <i>ulgulan</i>. P.K. Shukla's "Indigo Peasant Protests in North Bihar,
1867-1916", is a highly researched, well documented and analytical essay. On the basis of
extensive use of primary sources, which adds credence to his arguments, he underscores the
economic basis of the discontent, solidarity and resistance of the peasants of North Bihar against
the oppressive and inequitous indigo system enforced by the European planters, and brings to
light how the indigo peasants were acquiring consciousness and mobilizing resistance on their
own much before urban intelligentsia's intervention in their affairs. He argues that their resistance
was communitarian not sectional, class, caste or religion played no divisive role. He also very
cogently argues that it was this insurgency potentiality of the peasants that impressed Gandhi and
made him quickly realize the essentiality of peasants' presence in the nationalist movement to
make it forceful and effective.<p>

     With Nirmal Sengupta's article on regional characteristics of peasant movements and
Surendra Gopal's spotlighting of their changing social basis the anthology starts probing the
nature, character and extent of the organised phase of the peasant struggle in Bihar. Both of them
in their rambling accounts, <i>inter alia</i> drop hints of debunking the often romanticized legend of
Kisan Sabha's achievements by underscoring their flaws and limits. Sengupta argues that the
influence and effectiveness of the Kisan Sabha was limited only to some localized pockets of
Bihar because of its inability to broaden enough its ideology and programmes to encompass all
the diverse grievances and aspirations of the peasants of different districts. Surendra Gopal adds
to this assessment by referring to the circumscribed caste base of the Kisan Sabha movements
which led the middle caste peasants to form a separate organization, Triveni Sangh; though this
petered out soon, it helped sharpen the caste identities among the peasants with later unfortunate
consequences. But both these articles seem to be written in a hurry. Sengupta has not even given
references to the sources of his information.<p>

     The story of indigo is carried forward by Papiya Ghosh in her 'Peasants, Planters and
Gandhi: Champaran in 1917'. In her analysis of Gandhi's role in Champaran indigo agitation she
highlights how the peasants often defied Gandhian parameters of resistance even 

[<b>++Page 88   <i>Social Scientist</i></b>] 

though they defied him as "Ishwar Ka Avatar". She thus implies the existence of autonomous
domain of peasant consciousness and insurgency, virtually reinforcing Shukla's pointer to these
phenomenon. K.K. Sharma, in his article "Nationalist Struggle and Agrarian Movement in Bihar,
1927-1947", without trying to be pedantic, examines the nature of the. linkage and tensions
between agrarian struggles and the nationalist movement in Bihar. He marshals the data to show
how the nationalist leadership tried to "harness agrarian discontent to the cause of the nationalist
movement without taking up the class demands of the peasants", and concludes that their attempt
to sweep the agrarian class contradictions under the carpet often resulted in disharmony between
the two movements. Sharma's arguments are concise and coherent but his focus is mainly on the
organizational level - Kisan Sabha and the Congress interrelations. Had he descended down to
the ground level his investigations could have been more revealing, but probably he is
handicapped by the nature of information available in official and private archives.<p>

     Bhojnandan Prasad Singh and Manoj Kumar Roy in their scholarly article "Peasant
Protest and Congress Leadership in Bihar, 1930-1934" join the historiographical debate over the
pattern of imbrication of peasant insurgency with the Congress led nationalist movements, and
unknowingly contest the analysis and conclusions of K.K. Sharma. Depending heavily on Bipan
Chandra's thesis (Presidential Address to Indian History Congress, Amritsar Session 1985, later
published in a book form) the writer-duo assert that the role of Congress leadership and the
peasantry in the nationalist politics and movements were complementary, not antagonistic to
each other. They also deprecate Subalternist exaggeration of the existence of dichotomy between
the mainstream nationalism and the peasant insurgency. They argue forcefully, but the coherence
of arguments and fluency of factual narration are often hamstrung by the excessive zeal for
theoretical underpinnings.<p>

     Ranjan Kumar in his essay, "Kisan Sabha and the Congress Socialist Party in Bihar:
Cooperation and Confrontation, 1939-1955", systematically narrates the early cooperation and
later rift between the two organizations during their efforts to champion peasants' cause in Bihar.
He describes how the socialists by constantly goading Sahajanand from reformism to radicalism
revolutionized the ideology and programmes of the Kisan Sabha, and how with the help of the
rural activists provided by the Kisan Sabha, they started politicizing 


 [<b>++Page 89 <i>Social Scientist</i></b>] 

the peasant masses. After the rift, Sahajanand going the CPI way and the socialists choosing to
stay with mainstream nationalism, the politicized Bihar peasantry chose to follow the CSP line
and burst forth in a "massive rebellion" during the Quit India movement. The writer, however,
accuses the socialists of completely ignoring the interests of poor and landless peasants, and is
provoked to remark that the socialists were not the stuff to lead a real revolution for a radical
structural change in the agrarian society. The criticism is acerbic but plausible.<p>

     All the essays, four in number, dealing with the contemporaneous agrarian crisis in
central Bihar seek to explore its socio-economic roots, ideological orientations and the
government response to the prevailing violent conflicts. In analysis and findings they all are
repetitive; nonetheless, Saibal Gupta draws attention by his scholarly insight into the historicity
and complexities of the crisis. P.H. Prasad's analysis of poor peasant movements is in such a
diffused context that it makes his article somewhat ill-fitted in this collection, while Seema
Singh's article is simply redundant. A.K. Biswas' article should however, be read to understand
the perception of a sensitive government official. He dismisses the commonly held official
notion that the agrarian violence in central Bihar is a law and order problem, traces the historical
continuity of the oppressive system of bonded-labour and the eventual eruptions of violence in
this area, thereby supporting the views of the academics expressed in preceding essays.<p>

     Alak N. Sharma's perceptive essay on Bihar's agrarian sickness and economic paralysis
can be read with profit. One may easily agree with his analysis that the continuing existence of
semi-feudal elements in the agrarian structure and the rising expectations of awakened rural poor
have given birth to clashes of interests and the consequent violence. It is to be regretted that in
this collection of essays there is no specific article on the recurring waves of agrarian violence in
North Bihar where Naxalite turbulence and terrorism convulsed the rural society for a
considerable period. Girish Misra's detailing of Champaran Sathi land episode is more an
exposure of political and administrative corruption than a story of peasant resistance, and P.P
Ghosh's brief reference to a small and feeble peasant agitation for fair wages in an obscure
village of North Bihar cannot fill this vacuum.<p>

     In spite of some lacunae the book is a useful contribution to the ongoing regional studies
of the peasant society and movements. It is to be expected that the book will prove useful to
young researchers and the lay readers interested in understanding the agrarian

[<b>++Page 90   <i>Social Scientist</i></b>]

background of present day economic stagnation of Bihar. One of the editors K.K. Sharma's
detailed "Introduction" will help them grasp the contents of the book and the nuances of the
issues raised therein. A selected bibliography and index would have increased the usefulness of
the book.<p align=right>
