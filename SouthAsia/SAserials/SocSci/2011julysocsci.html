<p><b>Editorial</b></p>

<p>The eminent historian Irfan Habib said at a recent academic 
event in New Delhi that the real upholders and beneficiaries of 
the caste-system in India were not so much the Brahmins as the 
ruling classes, which is why the exclusively anti-Brahmin orientation 
of the contemporary dalit movement was so inapposite. Shireen Moosvi's 
lead article in the current issue of <i><b>Social Scientist</b></i> 
substantiates this point, by highlighting how even the Muslim rulers in 
early medieval India adjusted themselves, and lent support, to the caste 
system. This may appear strange at first sight, given the egalitarian 
thrust of Islam. But this egalitarianism never came in the way of the 
unequal treatment meted out to the slaves, enrolled from among the 
conquered people, by Muslim rulers everywhere in the world. And 
treating the oppressed castes in the same manner as slaves was but 
an easy transition for the medieval Indian rulers. Where there were 
exceptions, such as with Muhammad Tughluq, under whose reign many from 
lower castes were able to climb up to occupy important positions, 
the reason had to do with the exigencies of the situation rather 
than any conviction that caste divisions deserved to be set aside</p>

<p>The limitations of anti-Brahminism alone as the ideological cement for 
holding together a socio-political movement were exposed by the post-first 
world war experience in the Madras Presidency, which is recounted in Raj 
Sekhar Basu's paper. The formation of an anti-Brahmin front which brought 
the Justice Party to power in the elections held as a consequence of the 
Montague-Chelmsford reforms, soon gave way to a fracturing of this front 
and accusations by the Adi Dravidas, consisting of the so-called "untouchable 
castes", that the Justice Party administration had ignored their needs and 
aspirations. As distinct from the Brahmin-dominated Congress and the non-Brahmin 
upper-caste-dominated Justice Party, the Adi-Dravidas in the early 1920s 
increasingly began to express their own separate identity through their 
own organizations. This separate stream that emerged tended to see 
colonialism as an egalitarian force against the institutionalized 
inequalities of the pre-existing system; hence it emphasized socio-political 
empowerment of the so-called </p>

<p><i><b>Social Scientist</b></i>, p. 2</p>

<p>"untouchable castes" even to the exclusion of the anti-colonial 
struggle, i.e. within the existing order; and it even came in the 
way of joint struggles of workers of all castes, as in the case of 
the strike at the Buckingham Carnatic Mills.</p>

<p>There were powerful reasons of course for the assertion of this 
separate identity among workers, since the workers from the so-called 
"untouchable castes" were steeped in even more acute penury than their 
colleagues from other castes; but the beneficiary from this lack 
of unity among workers was British capital. This form of what 
would nowadays be called "identity politics" flourished in the 
twenties in the Madras Presidency and elsewhere because the anti-colonial 
struggle was still trapped within a problematic that allowed it to 
do so; it was only in the 1930s, especially after the Karachi 
Congress which laid down, in a manner of speaking, the outlines of 
a "social contract" that could constitute the basis for the formation 
of a free India, that the problematic itself began to change.</p>

<p>P.K.Shukla's paper which covers the struggles of the <i><b>adivasi</b></i> 
peasantry over a somewhat longer period brings to the fore the 
contradiction between the same two tendencies among the <b><i>adivasis</i></b>, 
as came to exist among the so-called "untouchable castes": one 
was the tendency of struggle against colonialism and the other 
was a tendency of keeping out of the anti-colonial struggle and 
trying to carve out a separate identity, and making demands on the 
basis of it, within the existing order. The former concerned itself 
with class issues and wanted to make common cause with other social 
forces; the latter concerned itself with "identity politics", 
emphasized exclusivism and pushed class issues to the background.</p>

<p>While the possibility of breaking out of one's assigned position within 
the caste hierarchy was denied to most castes, one group that did manage 
to do so according to the paper by R.N. Mishra was the <b><i>silpis</i></b> 
or artists. Assigned to a low caste status by the <i><b>Dharmashastra</b></i>, 
they managed over the centuries, through the acquisition of skills and 
knowledge, to obtain wealth and privileges that would not have normally 
come their way. Some even rose to become chieftains with titles like 
<b><i>ranaka, thakkura,</i></b> and <i><b>samanta</b></i>.</p>

<p>This issue has three additional pieces: one by Shamir Hassan is 
on the Oslo accord on Palestine; it explores both the background of 
the accord and its limitations, which, as anticipated by 'many including 
Edward Said, produced renewed conflict rather than any lasting peace. 
The second piece is a review article by Uma Maheshari on Suchetana 
Chattopadhyay's recently published biographical work on Muzaffar 
Ahmad, which explores both the personal journey of Muzaffar Ahmad 
and the ambience of Calcutta at the time, and; the third piece is a r
eview article by Indrani Sanyal.
