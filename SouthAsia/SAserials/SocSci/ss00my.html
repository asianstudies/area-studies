Editorial Note<p>

The protagonists of <i>Hindutva</i> portray the Brahmanical 
religion as a fundamentally unchanging entity. They trace the 
essentials of present day Hinduism to the beliefs of the Vedic 
Aryans. The lead article by Suvira Jaiswal in the current number 
of <i>Social Scientist</i> not only disputes this view and draws 
attention to the changes that occur over time in the nature of 
the Brahmanical religion, but also locates the origin of these 
changes in the evolving material conditions in society. The 
<i>Rgveda</i> is characterized by the lack of any hierarchical 
pantheon among the gods, a sort of "communism or democracy" 
among the gods where individual gods are "alternately regarded 
as the highest". In the later Vedic times by contrast, this simple 
democratic vision is lost: even gods are conceived of as divided 
into <i>varnas</i> and the emphasis shifts to rituals and the power 
of sacrifice, which is supposed to bend "even the gods to the will 
of the sacrificer". This move, away from the "simplicity of the 
religious feeling" in the <i>Rgveda</i> to a quest for power through 
sacrifices, is reflective of a shift from a segmentary tribal society 
with its egalitarian ethos, to an exploitative class society. The 
misery associated with such an exploitative society finds its echo 
in the <i>Upanishads</i> which seek to explain and justify suffering 
in terms of the doctrine of <i>karma</i> and <i>moksa</i>.<p>

	The rise of Buddhism and other heterodox sects represented 
a reaction against excessive ritualism and the large-scale killing of 
cattle for sacrificial purposes in the context of rising urbanism and 
the formation of imperial states. To combat these heterodox tendencies 
however the Brahamanical religion underwent yet another metamorphosis. 
It appropriated the ideology of <i>bhakti</i>, and incorporated the 
worship of popular deities of folklore such as Krsna-Vasudeva and 
Samkarsana-Baladeva by treating them as incarnations of vedic 
gods. While the ideology of <i>bhakti</i> proved effective in combating 
Buddhism and Jainism against the backdrop of the new social conditions 
that were emerging, it actually led to a consolidation of the 
<i>varna</i> system.<p>

	The relationship of colonialism with science, and the 
related issue of the attitude of educated Indians under colonial 
conditions towards "Western" science, constitute fascinating, 
though insufficiently<p>

explored themes. The paper by Deepak Kumar, which contains 
the text of his Presidential address to the Modern Indian History 
section of the Indian History Congress in Calicut, takes up these 
themes and outlines an agenda for research in this area. A particularly 
interesting issue raised in the paper is the view held by many practising 
scientists, notably P C.Ray, that the consolidation of the caste-structure, 
with its separation of mental from manual work, was responsible for 
the decline of the scientific spirit in India.

<p>	Certain related issues are also raised in Biplab Dasgupta's 
piece on Trade in Pre-Colonial Bengal. The fact that increased demand 
for textiles was accommodated through an increase in the work-force 
engaged in this sector rather than through an change in technology 
has led many to suggest that it is not colonialism that sabotaged the 
prospects of an industrial revolution in India, but India's own 
technological incapacity. Dasgupta joins issue with this view 
and argues that in the absence of colonialism, the stimulus of 
expanding markets would itself have brought forth technological 
upgradation, as happened elsewhere including in Britain itself. To 
be sure this relates to the realm of "might-have -beens"; and of 
course one must eschew any suggestion of automaticity. But the 
fact that colonialism foreclosed other possibilities, as emphasized 
by Paul Baran long ago, can scarcely be denied.

<p>	Finally we publish a piece by Eugene J. D'Souza 
which provides interesting information on Nazi propaganda in India, 
and especially on the role of the Hindu communalists in disseminating 
such propaganda. The admiration of the Hindu communalists for 
Nazism is well-known, but research, such as D'Souza's, on the 
subject, is extremely valuable.
