Editorial Note<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The armed-struggle tradition 
within the anti-imperialist upsurge has been a 
neglected area of study. No doubt this tradition itself was a diverse one; and 
none of the tendencies within this tradition managed even temporarily to 
acquire hegemony over the upsurge. Nonetheless the attention devoted to 
this tradition is way below what it deserves. We publish as the lead article 
of this issue of <i>Social Scientist</i> an assessment piece by Amit Gupta who has 
been working on this tradition for quite some time. The piece draws attention, 
interestingly, to certain striking similarities between the strategic perspective 
of the "terrorists" during the First World War and that of Subhash Bose during 
the Second; and it raises the question: why did this tradition, especially the 
Communists, not succeed in acquiring hegemony over the anti-imperialist 
struggle? He underscores their inability to combine the anti-imperialist 
struggle with the anti-feudal one, but this still begs the question. The paper 
does suggest a "subjective failure" on the part of the Communists but the 
matter clearly deserves further examination.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-imperialist struggle 
in India is far from over. What is often 
seen as the end of that struggle is but the end of only one phase of it. The 
question of hegemony over this struggle therefore is not a settled issue. 
Given the big bourgeoisie's recent proclivity to acquiesce in imperialist 
designs for recolonising the third world, a whole new era of opportunities 
for carrying forward the anti-imperialist struggle may be opening up once 
again before the Communist tradition. To be equal to the task however 
it is important to learn from past mistakes. For this, asking questions such 
as those raised in this paper is essential.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The theoretical structure 
which Javeed Alam has been erecting 
in recent years continues to be a focus of debate. In a recent issue of 
<i>Social Scientist</i> we had carried a detailed critique of his book. In the 
current issue we have a critique of his article "Indispensability of<p>

++Page 2  SOCIAL SCIENTIST<p>

Secularism" which had appeared in one of our earlier issues. Against 
Alam's argument that secularism is the only interlocutor that can 
coordinate and negotiate the new social phenomena unleashed by the 
process of "individuation", which has involved the detachment of a 
mass of people from their earlier bonds, Raghuramaraju argues that the 
process of "individuation" is necessarily incomplete. Indeed the raw 
material for communalism comes precisely from those who have left 
their communities, migrated to the urban centres, and are caught in 
the psychological trap of both imbibing and rejecting individualism. 
Anchoring the case for secularism in the process of "individuation", 
the author contends, amounts to making a poor case for it.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M.M.M.Mahroof's paper 
looks at the caste-system among 
the Sri Lankan Tamils, which differs between the different Tamil 
groups. The focus in the paper is on the Tamils of the North, principally 
of the Jaffna district, among whom the Vellalas, or the farmer caste, 
constitute the dominant caste exercising power and influence over 
the depressed castes.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thorstein Veblen 
inspired a stream of writing, by Douglas, 
Orage and others, which belongs broadly to the tradition of guild 
socialism. These authors advocated decentralisation of control over 
communal resources and the operations of industrial plants and 
processes, and were highly sensitive to environmental issues as 
well. This alternative socialist tradition is explored in the article 
by Hutchinson and Burkitt.<p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we carry 
a review article by Vishwa Mohan Jha 
on the book edited by Harbans Mukhia on the "Feudalism Debate", 
a theme which has, appositely, occupied a very important place 
in the Indian Marxist discourse.
