<P>Editorial</P>

<P>Important developments have been taking place in the sphere of
education of late:  a new National Curriculum Framework has been adopted
by the Central Advisory Board on Education; privatization of higher
education, enjoined upon us by GATS, has received a fillip from the
recent Supreme Court verdict abolishing reservations in non-State-aided
educational institutions; and the State, under pressure from finance
capital to curtail its expenditure, has been only too willing to hand
over the sphere of education to foreign agencies, including foreign
government agencies like DFID, and to private operators. These
developments, singly and collectively, amount to a major overhaul of the
entire educational system of the country, to the detriment of those
social objectives which formed the basis of our freedom struggle and
which were enshrined in our Constitution. The current issue of <I>Social
Scientist</I> discusses the nature and implications of these
developments.</P>

<P>Our concern with the National Curriculum Framework may at first sight
appear odd for two reasons: first, since a number of distinguished
educationists of the country, many of them well-known for their
opposition to communalism, have been associated with its formulation,
there should not be any room for opposition to it from within the
progressive circle; secondly, even if there was room for opposition,
since the NCF is only a broad framework whose impact on the nitty-gritty
of school textbooks and school education is tangential at best, there
should be no need to get exercised over it.</P>

<P>Not to be exercised over the NCF however would be cynical and
callous, and indeed an act of unfairness to its authors. No matter what
the NCF's impact on school textbooks and the like, it stands for a
certain outlook and philosophy, which, if not questioned, would be taken
<I>ipso facto</I>, but erroneously, as being universally accepted. This
outlook and philosophy at its best is an echo of what was propounded by
Jean Jacques Rousseau in the eighteenth century, though Rousseau's
influence might not have been imbibed directly or selfconsciously by the
authors of the NCF.</P>

<P>Rousseau was of the view that child nature was intrinsically good,
and hence education must be such as not to interfere with the natural
development of the child. Rousseau's position, notwithstanding the</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>Social Scientist</I></B></P>

<P>progressive role it played at the time, by raising a banner of revolt
against the rigid, authoritarian and disciplinarian education system
that had prevailed earlier, can scarcely be acceptable today. Apart from
the fact that his basic assumption about "innate goodness" would find
few takers among psychologists, the child in any case is not left in a
state of pristine purity outside of the education sphere. He or she
imbibes a whole range of values and attitudes from the family-setting
and the social environment, which in substantial measure tend to be
reactionary, obscurantist, communal and divisive. Education has to
combat these imbibed attitudes in order to create secular and democratic
citizens. During the French Revolution itself, Jacobin leaders like
Robespierre and SaintJust had emphasized the need for an interventionist
education. Though they had made the point in a somewhat extreme form, in
the context of the war and the need for inculcating' nationalism among
the French youth, the point itself has substance. The NCF's emphasis on
"local knowledge", its obsession with not putting too heavy a "burden"
on the children, and in general its espousal of a sort of laissez faire
policy that should be adopted when it comes to the ideas that should be
inculcated among children, amounts to "evading real issues and making
room for obscurantism", as the lead article by Professor Irfan Habib
argues. Though the NCF's case is often presented and justified in the
name of <I>pedagogy</I>, it has an underpinning that is
<I>ideological</I>, which is why, notwithstanding the fact that many of
its authors have been anti-communal, issue has to be joined with it.</P>

<P>All the papers contained in the present number, with the exception of
the ones by Professor Romila Thapar and Professor K.M. Shrimali which
were published in <I>The Hindu</I> and <I>Frontline</I> respectively,
and the other by were presented at two seminars organized by Sahmat, one
on the NCF, and the other, in collaboration with the Democratic
Teachers' Front, on "Debating Higher Education".</P>
