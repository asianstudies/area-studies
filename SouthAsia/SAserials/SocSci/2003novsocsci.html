Introduction
by <A HREF="#praveen">Praveen Jha*</A></P>

<P>The developments in the Indian economy since the explicit adoption of
a neo-liberal agenda in mid - 1991 by the Indian government have been
quite alarming on several fronts, as has come to be acknowledged by a
substantial segment of the economics profession. While acute distress
afflicting substantial sections of the masses in rural India, largely a
result of the deflation inherent in the neo-liberal economic policy, is
one of the more visible outcomes, a variety of other damaging
consequences organically linked to the ascendant policy regime, such as
collapse of employment generation, sharpening inequalities of different
kinds, increased vulnerability to external shocks, among others, have
been all too evident in the recent times.</P>

<P>Not that such disturbing consequences should come as a surprise. Much
of the neo-liberal reform was in any case based on specious theoretical
and empirical grounds and the writing was there on the wall for those
who cared to see. However, for a time the neo-liberal marketist
fundamentalists seemed to succeed in persuading many of the legitimacy
of their metaphysical claims by resorting to a blinkered discourse, in
particular by focusing on some of the failures of the Nehruvian
state-led development paradigm. Such a strategy was bound to lose steam
on the way. Thus, even in the neo-liberal camp today, the mood is at
best more of a guarded optimism as regards a whole range of macro
economic indicators, compared to the wild euphoria of the early
1990s.</P>

<P>Of course, it is nobody's case that India's post-independence
development strategy did not have serious flaws; on the contrary, the
critics on the left were quick to see through the veil of the socialist
rhetoric of the 1950s and '60s and highlighted major structural and
other limits constraining the development potential of the system. For
instance, the failure of the land reforms in most of rural India, the
state's inability to discipline the dominant classes which ultimately
impinged on its ability to mobilize resources for productive investment,
among others, were identified as the important factors behind the
nonrealization of many development promises made soon after
independence. Thus, in a sense, debates on appropriate economic
policies, or alternatives, consistent with the vision of a</P>

<P><I><B>Page 2</B></I></P>

<P>humane society, have been a marked feature right since the early days
of independence. By any reckoning, such debates have been intellectually
most stimulating and wide-ranging; unfortunately, it would appear that
the blinkered and distorted discourse of the neo-liberals has tended to
debase this rich tradition.</P>

<P>Professor D.R. Gadgil was among the most eminent economists to have
contributed significantly to the debates of the highest quality that
shaped independent India's economic policy almost upto early 1970s.
Social Scientist and the Gadgil Birth Centenary Committee had jointly
organized a seminar on "Alternatives before India in the Context of
Globalization" on 14'", and 151 September 2002 to commemorate the
contributions of this outstanding economist, to reiterate the
progressive vision shared by him, and to explore the contours of such a
vision at the current conjuncture. Close to twenty substantial
presentations were made at this seminar, covering not only different,
aspects of economic policy and a whole range of sectoral issues, but
also thei es relating to media, culture, ideology etc. Of these, twelve
were submitted to <I>Social Scientist</I> as revised papers. A brief
introductory note on D.R. Gadgil and six substantive papers have
appeared in the preceding two issues of Social Scientist and this issue.<BR>

September 2003 Introduction</A>]</P>

<P>In sum, taken together, these papers, spanning over three issues of
Social Scientist and covering a wide range of areas, provide a powerful
critique of the neo-liberal prescriptions while also engaging with the
question of viable alternatives and their underlying roadmaps. What we
have are indepth analyses of the relevant issues, backed by a wealth of
scholarship, which attempt to grapple with some of the most pressing
issues confronting Indian economy and society and this brief note is not
the place to summarise the contributions of the individual authors.
Instead I would like to conclude by saying, with reference to the
subject of viable alternatives, that the central issue is of an activist
state that has the courage and commitment to chalk out its national
economic policies with the provision of sustainable livelihoods to its
population being high on the agenda. Sure enough, the issue is not the
lack of viable alternatives; it is more about synergising the dispersed
efforts to push the state towards s
