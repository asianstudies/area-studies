<P>Editorial</P>

<P>An idea has been assiduously promoted of late that the Indian economy
has shown a remarkable reduction in poverty since the introduction of
neo-liberal policies. In the lead article in the current issue of
<I>Social Scientist</I>, which is the text of a lecture delivered in
memory of Safdar Hashmi on April 10, 2004, Utsa Patnaik refutes this
claim on the basis of a wealth of evidence. Of course a <I>practical</I>
refutation of this idea, which constituted a part of the "India Shining"
campaign, was given by the electorate in May when it threw out the NDA
government from power. Nonetheless this intellectual refutation,
advanced even before the electoral verdict, remains highly relevant,
especially because the elements which thought India was "shining" are
now busy claiming that the electoral verdict had nothing to do with
distress and hunger.</P>

<P>Patnaik shows that per capita food availability in India as a whole
has declined precisely over the liberalization period, to a level in
2001-02 which is roughly the same as in the late nineteen thirties, i.e.
on the eve of the second world war. One can be almost certain therefore
that the per capita food availability in rural India and especially for
the rural poor would be lower than what it was, for these very groups,
on the eve of the second world war. Since the concept of poverty in
India is linked to calorie intake, rural poverty ratio should have
increased noticeably during the liberalization period; and this is
precisely what has happened according to direct data on the calorie
equivalent of the quantities of food consumed. Official sources give a
contrary impression because they rely on an estimation method that is
faulty, and also apply this method to data that are acknowledged to be
contaminated.</P>

<P>Margit Koves in her paper on fascism in the age of global capitalism,
argues, on the basis of Eastern European experience, that the real
antagonism that "global capitalism" produces is between "full citizens"
and the "underclass" which is excluded from the public space, and for
which the neo-liberal State accepts no responsibility. The "underclass"
moreover is increasingly ethnicized; and ethnic, race or religious
solidarity takes the place of class solidarity. Since a characteristic
of fascism is to transform class antagonism into racial, ethnic,
cultural and religious antagonism, fascisization constitutes an</P>

<P>immanent tendency of contemporary global capitalism. It can be
countered with the emancipatory project of the Enlightenment, with the
demand for "universality" and the rejection of the false choice between
ethnic/religious fundamentalism and multiculturalism. The violence of
the market and the violence of terrorism can both be countered by class
struggle and the promotion of a socialist culture, for which it is
essential to start identifying with the immigrants and the
"underclass".</P>

<P>Ashok Mitra's Abanindra Nath Tagore lecture sees the spread of
globalization as a force destroying people's art. In fact it is the
slowness of the percolation of globalization in the vast countryside
that constitutes India, in which he sees a source of hope. It allows for
a longer survival of people's art and provides precious breathing time
for preparing for the battle that will decide the fate of "native,
non-automatic cogitation".</P>

<P>Finally, we carry two obituaries, for two stalwarts of very different
kinds who passed away in recent weeks. Jyoti Basu reminisces about
Professor Hiren Mukherjee, one of the outstanding intellectuals of the
country whose ideas had nourished the Communist movement for long. And
Prabhat Patnaik pays a tribute to Dr.Samar Ranjan Sen, well-known
economist who played a leading role in the initiation of the process of
planned development in the country.</P>
