<P>Editorial Note</P>

<P>To see the imperialist aggression on Iraq as a mere episode, albeit
of a horrendous nature, would be a grave error; it is symptomatic of the
onset of a whole new era of imperialism. This era is defined by two
basic features. The first is the emergence of a new form of
international finance capital. This has created the need for a surrogate
"World State". Capital always needs the support of the State, the nature
of the capital determining ultimately the nature of the State that would
service its requirements. Not surprisingly therefore the emergence of
globalized finance creates the need for a corresponding State whose writ
would run over the global domain as a whole. Secondly, the gap between
the relative strengths of the US and other capitalist powers has become
extraordinarily large. Inevitably, under these circumstances, the US is
increasingly taking on this role of a global imperialist State, with
other powers willy-nilly having to support it: some like Britain have
joined the bandwagon already while others like France and Germany are
having to reconcile themselves sullenly to the dominant position of the
US.</P>

<P>In short, the two basic features of contemporary capitalism combine
to usher in a global dictatorship of US super-imperialism, the path for
which has been cleared with the collapse of the Soviet Union. The
occupation of Iraq is of course a symptom of this tendency; it also in
addition provides a powerful impetus to this tendency, since this
occupation, by putting the massive Iraqi oil reserves at its disposal,
helps the US to resist the challenge from the European Union to its
dominant role.</P>

<P>It is important for everyone, especially those of us who are in the
third world, to understand the nature of the transformations that are
occurring in world imperialism and to locate the developments in Iraq
within that context. The article on Iraq by Sukumar Muralidharan in the
current number of <I>Social Scientist</I> should help the readers to get
an insight not only into the travails of that hapless country, including
its history as a victim of imperialist aggrandizement, but also into the
contradictions that exist today, and are centred on Iraq, between the
rival imperialist powers.</P>

<P>Professor Irfan Habib, the outstanding historian, develops in the
lead article of this number a theory of imperialism, taking Rosa</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>Luxemburg's celebrated work as his starting point. The hallmark of
this theory is a categorization of economies and sectors on the basis of
their "capital?intensities" (differing "capital intensities" being a
characteristic feature of "uneven development"), which permits the more
"capital-intensive" sectors to earn surplus profits through exchange
with the less "capital-intensive" ones. The exchange between the
advanced and the backward capitalist economies on the world scale is the
most obvious and extreme form of this phenomenon.</P>

<P>By a curious coincidence the historian Irfan Habib's excursus into
political economy is followed by the economist Biplab Dasgupta's
excursus into the realm of history. Dasgupta analyzes the nature of
colonial state power in order to answer the question: how could the
British rule such a far?away and enormous country like India despite
there being such a minuscule physical presence of Europeans in colonial
administration? Obviously it was the Indians who provided the personnel
of the administration, but they were kept in place through a combination
of the use of cultural tools and coercion. Both these instruments
however progressively lost their edge as the anticolonial upsurge
acquired momentum.</P>

<P>Finally, we publish a critical appreciation by Mazhar Hussain of the
work of Kaifi Azmi, the outstanding poet who was a life-long fighter in
the cause of the progressive movement in the country. This piece
constitutes <I>Social Scientist</I>'s tribute to the poet whose first
death anniversary is being observed in May.</P>
