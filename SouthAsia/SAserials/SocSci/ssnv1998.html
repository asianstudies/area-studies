Introduction<p>

This issue of the Social Scientist brings together 
diverse themes for our readers. The first paper - 'Siting 
the body: Perspectives on health and medicine in colonial 
Orissa'- focuses on certain aspects 
against a canvas of social history. Taking 
up the adivasis and the non-tribal communities, it 
explores various complexities that range from the Hindulsation 
of tribals and the contestory aspects vis-a-vis non-tribals 
to inoculation, the so-called subversive cults and black magic.<p>

Sanjoy Bhattacharya's, 'Re-devising Jennerian vaccines?:  
European technologies, Indian innovation and the control of 
smallpox in South Asia, 1850 - 1950'delineates the technological 
aspects of vaccination in colonial India. While questioning the 
method of locating a 'monolithic' medical establishment which 
imposed western medicine, it outlines the way things actually 
worked. Here Bhattacharya contextualises the vaccination 
programme by referring to factors like class, or the rural areas 
which were plagued by persistent infrastructural constraints. 
As emphasised, the opposition to vaccination was premised 
on a host of complex reasons and not just because it was 
'European in character.' The paper projects'the experiments.
and innovations, which sometimes assumed the form of inoculation 
in the rural areas. As argued, this could also be seen as a 
reason to explain the opposition to vaccination. And finally, 
Bhattacharya shows how the issue of experiments on humans 
was a feature that was considered normal even in England and 
a nationalist reading of this can be flawed since vaccine testing 
on humans actually increased after August 1947, though it 
did become 'progressively unfashionable' to refer to it.<p>

Manjiri N. Kamat's, 'The War Years and the Sholapur cotton 
textile industry' situates Sholapur and its labour history in the 
context of plague, scarcity, labour shortages and the working 
conditions in the textile mills. She delineates the links between 
colonialism and the Indian capitalists at Sholapur by mentioning 
the pattern of<p>

recruitment. As argued, the very idea of a settlement for 
the 'criminal tribes' (from 1912 onwards) was a part of a 
multi-dimensional strategy. Thus, it was designed to reduce 
the expenditure incurred in the jails, act as a 'civilising'/'rehabilitation' 
mission for the 'criminal tribes', reduce the expenditure on 
relief work in the context of the famine and ensure a cheap 
labour force for the Indian mill owners at Sholapur, which 
was 'bound' to the mills. Given this, the strikes of the 
1920-22 revealed the close relationship - not only between 
the mill owners and the colonial administration - but also the 
Congress. Moreover, they could be suppressed ruthlessly without 
any gains fot the workers. Ironically these conditions also ensured 
high profits for the capitalists during the 'Great Depression'.<p>

Geetanjali Gangoli's, 'Reproduction, Abortion and Women's Health' takes 
up a contemporary issue which is of tremendous significance. The issue 
of sex determination tests and women's health is woven and situated 
against a canvas of the family planning programme and the law. 
What began in 1982 as a feminist movement in Bombay and 
emerged victorious with the adoption of a law banning these 
techniques in 1988 in Maharastra, was followed by a law at the 
national level (1992) along similar lines. Gangoli brings together 
the perspectives and the issues which saw the evolution of the 
debate, leading to passing of the 1994 Pre-natal Diagnostic 
Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act in the Parliament.<p>

And finally, the review article of Nilanjan Sarkar takes up two 
books which deal with the 'voices' of women, in their contest 
against the hierarchies imposed by patriarchy in medieval 
south India.<p align=right>
