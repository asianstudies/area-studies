<P>Introduction by <B>Sanjoy Bhattacharaya</B></P>

<P><B><I>Preventive and Curative Health in South Asia</I></B></P>

<P>This special issue arises from some of the proceedings of a
conference entitled 'Imperialism, Medicine and South Asia', held at
Wolfson College, Cambridge, on the 15th and the 16th of June 2001. This
gathering was made possible with generous support received from the Asia
Committee of the European Science Foundation, Sheffield Hallam
University, UK, and the Wellcome Unit for the History of Medicine at the
University of Oxford, UK.</P>

<P>The five essays presented here are based on a wide range of
historical sources. Some of these collections have not been deployed
before, while others are analysed in new ways. The articles' authors
are, therefore, able to provide us with a variety of fresh perspectives,
which would be useful both to academics and health professionals. 'Many
of the themes dealt with herein have not received much attention before,
and it is thus hoped that the articles that follow will stoke further
research on related themes.</P>

<P>The collection is kicked off by a piece by S. Arseculeratne titled
'Interactions between Traditional Medicine and Western Medicine in Sri
Lanka'. This looks at the frequently troubled links between western
biomedicine and traditional medical systems in Sri Lanka. It also
describes and compares official efforts to combine the provision of
western and traditional medical systems in the colonial and
post-colonial periods, and assesses the possibility of arranging a
synthesis of these in the contemporary period.</P>

<P>The next contribution is an article authored jointly by Samrat
Chaudhury and Nitin Varma. Titled 'Between GodsIGoddessesl Demons and
"Science": Perceptions of Health and Medicine among plantation labourers
in Jalpaiguri District, Bengal', this piece attempts to explore the
attitudes of tea garden workers towards health issues</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>and state-sponsored medical schemes in the Duars region of the
Jalpaiguri district (West Bengal state in India). While the trends in
the post-independence period are approached from an oral history
perspective, the authors also make an effort to examine the colonial
context. This helps them to analyse the nature of continuities in
medical and public health policy in the region.</P>

<P>The next article, by Sunniva Engh, is titled 'Donors' Dilemmas:
Scandinavian aid to the Indian Family Planning Programme, 1970-80', and
looks at the complex basis of Swedish and Norwegian government
participation in the Indian population control schemes. By deploying a
range of hitherto unused historical material, the author shows how
deeply this involvement was affected by domestic politics in
Scandinavia. This is, of course, a valuable corrective. Most existing
studies have persisted in explaining the shifts in funding patterns and
the re-adaptation of policy by conditions existing in India. Engh
reveals the significance of looking at the Swedish and the Norwegian
governments' assessments of the course of the Indian family control
programme (including its more pernicious aspects, like enforced
sterilisation), and the effects of the resultant debates on the funding
of the scheme.</P>

<P>The following piece, titled 'The Final Inch: The eradication of
smallpox and beyond', is by John R Wickett. It deals with important
aspects of the successful Indian smallpox eradication programme (SEP) of
the 1970s, and compares this will the strategies being deployed as part
of the current internationally-sponsored global anti-AIDS campaign.
Drawing generalisations about the usefulness - and the sustainability -
of WHO-funded vertical public health programmes, on the basis of the SEP
experiences, Wickett describes the rationale of - and the tensions in -
contemporary AIDS control strategies. Wickett's perspectives are
refreshing precisely because they are based on his personal involvement
in the SEP in India and Africa, which gave him valuable insights into
the mode of operation of internationally-funded programmes in developing
countries. Of particular interest is his contention that while success
in public health campaigns is closely reliant on the quality of local
government, the final stage of implementation of a project is ultimately
dependant on the dedicated service of a core group of workers. This
important point is often ignored in academic assessments of the working
of international health programmes.</P>

<P>The final article in this issue is titled 'Unmet needs: Reproductive
health needs, sex work and sex workers'. Written by Geetanjali</P>

<P>p. 3	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>Gangoli, it describes the efforts made by the colonial and
post-colonial Indian governments to monitor the health of sex workers,
as well as the efforts made by official agencies and NGOs, in the 1980s
and the 1990s, to improve health standards amongst them. While examining
the health consequences of sex work, and making a distinction between
the experience of children and women in the profession, Gangoli makes
the valuable argument that 'health care seeking behaviour' depends both
on social and psychological factors, as well as the quality of
facilities made available to any given community.</P>

<P>I would like to end this introductory statement by thanking the Asia
Committee of the European Science Foundation for all the support that
made this special issue possible.</P> </FONT>
