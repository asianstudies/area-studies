<b><a name="edit">Editorial Note</a></b><p>

We live in odd times. Anyone who professes to be secular these days, in the
sense of wanting a separation of religion from politics, invites 
general derision. Derision from the votaries of <i>Hindutva</i> is of course to be expected;
indeed a secular person would consider it a badge of honour. Intriguingly
however derision also comes from a wholly different quarter, from a host of
intellectuals who cannot be accused of being sympathetic to the <i>Hindutva</i> 
agenda. Now, if the opposition of these intellectuals to secularism was linked
to an alternative programme that they advocated for fighting <i>Hindutva</i>, a
programme which they thought was potentially more effective 
than the secular programme in fighting the fascists constituting the <i>Hindutva </i>brigade,
then the matter would be altogether different. But there is no 
palpable alternative programme, which is what makes their position rather curious.<p>

There are several different strands to the argument that they offer against
secularism. But in essence it emphasises the fact that the idea of separating
religion from politics is an illicit transplantation from the European context.
The illicitness is variously illustrated: sometimes as being part of an 
imperialist discourse, sometimes on the grounds that in contrast to Protestant Europe
our society "seethes with vibrant religiosity% sometimes on the grounds that
the concept of secularism represents the tyranny of post-enlightenment 
rationality. A lay person would be tempted to ask at this point: so what? Just as the
attempt to transplant Westminister-style democracy has led to something
altogether different in our country because of the specificitles of our social
structure, <i>but nonetheless what it has led to is eminently 
worthwhile</i>, likewise, one can argue, the attempt to transplant secularism, while it might not
necessarily replicate the European scene here, is still eminently defensible. In
other words to argue from our "particularities" that the attempt 
to transplant secularism is an illicit one, is a <i>non-sequitur.</i> But the argument persists.<p>

The lead article by javeed Alam in the current number of <i>Social Scientist</i> 
is a critique of this argument. Since the authority of Gandhi is often invoked in
support of an alternative conception to secularism, as it is normally 
understood, Alarn's reference to Gandhi, including the quotation with which the
article begins, is extremely apposite.<p>

Malini Bliattacharya's Safflar Hashmi Memorial Lecture makes the 
extremely important point, among others, that "globalisation is not necessarily
opposed to traditionalism". Indeed on the contrary, traditionalism, since it
signifies "closed-in identities with no possibility of dialogic exchange and
mutual communication% leads to a sort of "ghettoisation" which further
strengthens imperialist hegemony. The paper discusses the 
strategy of cultural struggle in the era of globalisation within this perspective.<p>

What has happened to Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union is
unparallelled in modern history: so great has been the economic retrogression 

<b>[++Page 2 Social Scientist] </b>

there that Russia's population has of late declined even in absolute terms,
which is a remarkable occurrence in peace time. We are fortunate to have in
the current number an article by Professor Maliarov, a distinguished Russian
economist of the Left, analysing the contradictions of the Soviet system that
led to its collapse, and outlining a programme that would take contemporary
Russia forward. We also publish an article by Nita Mitra that discusses the
range of issues relating to power and planning from a somewhat different
perspective.<p>
