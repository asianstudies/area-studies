Editorial Note<p>

All except one of the essays published in the current number 
of <i>Social Scientist</i> were originally presented at a 
seminar in Thiruvananthapuram organised on the first death 
anniversary of Comrade E.M.S.Namboodiripad. The lone exception 
is Utsa Patnaik's paper on "EMS on the Agrarian Question", which 
was presented at a seminar held in Perinthalmana, close to EMS's 
birth place, a few months after his death. Each paper in the 
present volume therefore is meant as a tribute to the memory of 
EMS, and bringing them together is a means of <i>Social 
Scientist</i>'s paying its own tribute to him. The current 
number of the journal is designed to be a posthumous homage 
to Comrade EMS.<p>


Utsa Patnaik's paper analyses EMS's views on the agrarian 
question based on his application of the Marxist theory 
of groundrent. His views were first set forth in his famous 
<i>Minute of Dissent</i> to the Malabar Tenancy Commission, 
which, together with the Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha's 
<i>Memorandum</i> to the Floud Commission, constitutes one of 
the classics of communist writing on the Indian agrarian 
question. After nearly a half-century, he wrote a piece 
in one of the Marx Centenary volumes of <i>Social Scientist</i> 
(of which there were three), again looking at the agrarian 
question from the perspective of the theory of ground-rent, 
a piece which can also be seen as EMS's own contribution to 
the "Mode of Production" debate in India. Utsa Patnaik shows 
the remarkable consistency in EMS's views on the agrarian 
question over this halfcentury, and argues that this consistency 
in turn derives from the objective fact that, notwithstanding 
all the changes that have taken place in Indian agriculture, 
the basic democratic tasks on the agrarian front have not 
been accomplished.<p>

	All the other pieces deal, in one way or another, 
with the emergence of communal-fascism in our country: its 
implications, the distortions of history it resorts to in 
its attempt to legitimise itself, and its links with the 
current conjuncture. The articles are not of course exclusively 
devoted to this theme; they are quite wide-ranging. But this 
theme is one on which they all converge, and around it they 
make a set of points which are both insightful and instructive. 
Bipan Chandra's paper for instance categorically refutes 
the claim, which<p>

one comes across so often, that secularism in the sense 
of a separation of politics from religion was rejected 
even by Gandhiji himself (which is supposed to show how 
"alien" it was in the Indian context). Irfan Habib traces 
the history of the "idea of India", i.e. of an inclusive 
notion of India transcending the particular universes of 
"the Hindus" or "the Muslims", or of this or that caste or 
region. He sees this idea taking shape and acquiring a conceptual 
substance over a long period, in contrast both to the 
communalists who deride this idea as being a mere latter-day 
manufacture, and to the colonial historians who (in an exactly 
similar vein) credit only colonialism with creating the 
conditions for the breaking down of particularities. The 
authentic realisation of this idea however requires, according 
to Prakash Karat, not only an ideological-political battle, 
but also a change in the material conditions of living of the 
people, the key to which lies in the democratic transformation 
of the agrarian relations, the unfinished task that EMS 
emphasised in writings spanning over half a century. An 
important component of this ideological battle is the struggle 
for the preservation and advance of secular-democratic education; 
K.N.Panikkar underscores the need for secular initiatives 
in this regard. Aijaz Ahmad draws attention to the immense 
brutalisation of day-to-day cultural life which has come in 
the wake of economic liberalisation, and which underlies 
<i>inter alia</i> the aggressive assertion of Hindutva. 
Prabhat Patnaik in a similar vein joins issue with those 
who see "liberalisation" as an antidote to communal-fascism; 
on the contrary, he argues, the two are dialectically related 
and proceed in tandem.<p>

	E.M.S. Namboodiripad fought for a secular, democratic 
and socialist India till his last breath. It is only 
appropriate that we pay our homage to him by taking up 
these very themes that engaged him so passionately.
