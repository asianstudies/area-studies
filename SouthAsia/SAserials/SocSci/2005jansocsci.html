<P>Editorial</P>

<P>India is one of the lew countries in the non-Communist third world
which still has a strong Communist movement. A major reason for this
abiding strength of the Communist movement here lies in the fact of its
consistent and unwavering anti-imperialism which finds an echo in the
deep anti-imperialism of the masses, rooted as much in the history of
two centuries of colonial rule, as in the concrete experience ot
impoverishment under the current imperialist onslaught that is
euphemistically called "globalization". This, as the lead article by
Prabhat Patnaik argues in the current number of <I>Social Scientist</I>,
is indeed the historic role of the Communist movement in countries like
ours in the current conjuncture. With the bourgeoisie, which had
established hegemony over the anti-colonial struggle, now openly
collaborating with imperialism, it is not only possible but indeed
necessary for the Communists to provide leadership to the nation in its
anti-imperialist struggle. Of course the current conjuncture is one
where the contradiction between imperialism and what is called
"terrorism" has a tendency to squeeze out all other forms of political
praxis. But the only way to break out of this <I>impasse</I> is for the
Communists to play their historic role and to mobilize the masses in an
anti-imperialist struggle. Patnaik discusses at length the perception
that should underlie such mobilization.</P>

<P>Aijaz Ahmad's inaugural lecture as the holder of the Khan Abdul
Chalfar Khan Chair at Jamia Millia Islamia is not only a remarkably
perceptive unravelling of the enigma that was Badshah Khan, but also an
overview of the entire backdrop of separatist politics against which he
conducted his political praxis. Of special interest is Ahmad's contrast
between the political trajectories followed by Badshah Khan on the one
hand and Jinnah on the other, the former a mass leader with strong links
with the peasantry and an aversion to power and pelf, who remained
committed to a vision of secular nationalism till the end despite being
a deeply religious person, the latter a person with hardly any mass base
to start with, who, despite starting out as a secular nationalist and
having very little religious sentiments himself, progressively went down
the path of communal-sectarian politics precisely because of being
trapped within an elite discourse. Associated with this distinction is
another one which Ahmad draws</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>Social Scientist</I></B>, Jan-Feb 2005</P>

<P>between two different notions of "Muslim nationalism", one referring
to Muslims who subscribed to a pan-Indian nationalism, the other to
those who nurtured the idea of Muslims being a nation in themselves.
Badshah Khan and Jinnah represented the two types.</P>

<P>The richness of Ahmad's paper shows itself in the number of questions
one is left asking at the end of it. Can a homogeneous term called
"nationalism" be used to cover both "Indian nationalism" and "Hindu" or
"Muslim nationalism"; or does the concept of a "Hindu" or "Muslim
nationalism" represent a contradiction in terms, in the sense that such
non-inclusive "nationalism" necessarily entails collaboration with
imperialism and hence an utter incapacity to build any nation
whatsoever? (The fact that bourgeois votaries of the <I>inclusive</I>
nationalist project <I>also</I> betray it at some stage to collaborate
with imperialism does not negate the centrality ol anti-imperialism for
any nation-building project in the third world). Likewise, in talking
indiscriminately about "elite discourses of nationalism" are we not in
danger of losing sight of the central fact that the Congress <I>did</I>
mobilize people against imperialism, while the League's role was to
<I>prevent</I> the Muslim masses from joining the anti-imperialist
struggle?</P>

<P>Edward Said who died recently was a passionate and intrepid advocate
of the cause of the Palestinian people, and, for that reason, commanded
respect in progressive quarters everywhere. Many of his theoretical
positions however, notably on "Orientalism", are highly contentious lor
any radical scholar. In making "Orientalism" a pejorative term
synonymous with a colonial discourse and placing all writers from the
West, including Karl Marx, as proponents ol this discourse, Said is
doing a great disservice to the very people of the third world for whom
he professes sympathy. Irfan Habib's paper provides a much-needed
critique of Said's views on "Orientalism".</P>

<P>Finally, Imrana Qadeer and K.R.Nayar show how commoditization of
health care and privatization of medical education are creating an
altogether new situation where the peoples' suflering and lack of
information are to be utilized for the purpose of private profit-making.
One occasionally hears the view that the World Bank, being concerned
with development, is a rather benign entity, unlike its Bretton Woods
twin, the IMP, which acts blatantly as a loan-shark. Since much ol the
health-care reforms are undertaken at the behest of the World Bank, this
paper should serve to dispel all such illusions.</P>
