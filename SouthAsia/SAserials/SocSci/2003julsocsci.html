<P>Introduction by <B>Prabhat Patnaik</B></P>

<P>The editorial team of <I>Social Scientist</I> has for some time been
acutely conscious of the fact that the journal is falling short of the
role that is required of it at the current juncture. Not that the
journal has not changed; it has, and quite significantly. But the nature
of the social demand upon it has changed even more dramatically. What
was adequate, even more than adequate, in the seventies and the early
eighties, when, notwithstanding the vicissitudes in the hfe of
socialism, the vigour of a socialist challenge could be taken for
granted, would not suffice today when the Soviet Union has collapsed and
a revived imperialism is running riot. This requires of us not just
scholarly exposes of imperialism and of the fundamentalist and
communal-fascist tendencies that mushroom at this juncture. These are
important; we have been doing these and shall continue to do these. But
something more is needed: a more intense, and direct engagement with
contemporary issues and ideas, and a more conscious effort to "recover"
the Left tradition. Towards this end we propose to carry many more short
notes, book reviews, opinion pieces, obituaries etc. than we have been
doing, in addition to the scholarly articles, and without compromising
with the basic academic quality of the journal. The current issue
therefore marks a change not just in the journal's appearance, but also
in its contents.</P>

<P>The lead article by Irfan Habib, which is his convocation address at
the Asian College of Journalism, provides a panoramic view of a range of
issues in historiography, and in particular a critique of Karl Popper's
attack on "historicism". Echo^ng the view expressed by Mao Zedong that
the struggle between capitalism and socialism could last some five
hundred years (Georg Lukacs in a similar vein had once talked of the
transition from capitalism to socialism being almost as protracted,
nearly three hundred years, as that from feudalism to capitalism), Habib
underscores the need for a critical history of socialism as it fared in
practice, which could suggest how more succesful alternatives to
capitalism should be essayed in future.

<P>The drought of 2002-03 has focussed attention on the acute distress
afflicting rural India, but while the drought may have made things
worse, growing distress has been the lot of rural India for quite some
time now, a result largely of the deflation and the exposure of
producers to global price volatility that have come in the wake of the
neo-liberal economic polite. The per capita foodgrain availability, not
just in the drought year, but even by 2000-01, had</P>

<P>p. 3	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>come. down for the country as a whole to the average level that
prevailed during the Second World War which includes the years of the
Bengal famine; the per capita calorie intake in rural India had declined
by over one-eighth in the decade and a half since 1983 and is estimated
to have declined further by at least one-tenth in the last five years;
and rural development expenditure as a percentage of GDP had halved
during the decade of the nineties, restricting the injection of
purchasing power into the countryside. Utsa Patnaik's paper provides a
comprehensive picture and a radical analysis of this alarming
deterioration in living conditions in rural India. The fact that reputed
journals in the country, at this very moment, are replete with articles
about the 'success' of poverty reduction in the 1990s, is only
indicative of the decline in integrity that has occurred in a
significant segment of the economics profession.</P>

<P>The so-called IT revolution continues to be a source of much
mystification. At one time there was talk of as many as 20 million
skilled jobs being created in the country on account of the shift of
services from the North to the South brought about. through the IT
revolution, not to mention the jobs created abroad for Indian IT
professionals. The suggestion was even made that the Left, imprisoned in
its old dogmas and cliches, had no inkling of the massive changes
occurring worldwide. The slump in the metropolitan IT sector has, for
the time being at least, put an end to such talk. The subject
nonetheless remains an intriguing one. There are few people as competent
to talk about it as C.PChandrasekhar whose article we carry in this
number.</P>

<P>Finally, we pay our respects to three major intellectuals, associated
with the Left movement, who passed away recently.</P>
