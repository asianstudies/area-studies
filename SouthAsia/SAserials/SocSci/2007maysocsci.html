<P><font size="+1">Introduction</font></P>
<P><font size="+1">This issue of the <I>Social Scientist</I> focuses on
  colonia/contemporary Indian history. Projit Behari Mukarji examines the
  classification strategies of the colonial administration with the
  expanding boundary of colonialism and the problems posed by 'modernity'.
  These complexities created the need to confront and communicate with new
  environments and contexts and also to transfer knowledge acquired in one
  context to another. There was thus a need to 'standardise' and
  'rationalise' an unfamiliar reality. In fact, till the end of the
  nineteenth century we find- botanists and government agencies admitting
  that they often supplied the wrong drugs. As Mukharji argues, this
  crisis resulted due to the growing 'extra-local' nature of the
  pharmaceutical industry.</font></P>
<P><font size="+1">Indrani Sen's contribution focuses on the white woman's mental
  illness over the second half of the nineteenth century in colonial
  India. She delineates the gendered theories on psychiatry which
  prevailed in the Victorian age and the turn of the century. She focuses
  on the subordinate social position of the white woman in the colony.
  Besides examining references to 'common' mental problems, the article
  also focuses on the lunatic asylums of British India. Here, she takes up
  the case histories of white women patients - generally of the lower
  social orders - who were 'confined'. Sen highlights the intricacies of
  both gender and class when it comes to the white woman's mental illness
  in colonial India.</font></P>
<P><font size="+1">Nitin Varma studies the indenture system in the Assam tea
  plantations. This system developed with the abolition of slavery and
  problems of labour supply to the colonial plantations. It saw the
  collusion between the capitalist and colonial interests to create a
  system that was similar to slavery. Going beyond the 'freedom/unfreedom'
  binary, the paper discusses the strategies of control that drew upon
  various 'stereotypes', 'discourses' and 'practices', which were both
  'dynamic and contested'. It examines assertions related to the
  homogeneity of the 'capitalist class' and its collusive drives with the
  state, in the classic 'planter-raj' model.  Varma argues that the
  concerns and interests between both did not necessarily always
  converge.</font></P>
<P><font size="+1">Finally, Panchanan Bhoi's contribution examines the</font></P>
<P><font size="+1">p. 2	<B><I>Social Scientist</I></B></font></P>
<P><font size="+1">development of an art form associated with the making of palm leaf
  manuscripts in Orissa. Tracing its pre-colonial origins, the article
  locates the diversities related to the technique of production of the
  palm leaf manuscripts. It delineates the shifts and changes that this
  art form went through over the nineteenth century with the growth of
  print culture and the decline of patronage of the feudal sections. The
  world of the scribe artists is explored through oral testimonies,
  bringing to life fascinating details related to their diverse social and
  religious origins. Bhoi's paper tells us of an art form that struggles
  to survive under the pressure of globalisation.</font></P>
