<P>Introduction</P>

<P>I.S. Gulati was an outstanding personality of our time. A member of a
Sikh refugee family in Delhi in the post-Partition period, he had to
take up a minor job in the government for the survival of the family. He
completed his university education with brilliant results even while
holding this job, went abroad for higher studies, and subsequently
occupied with great distinction a number of academic and official
positions. The last of these was the Vice-Chairmanship of the Kerala
State Planning Board under whose aegis during his tenure the bold and
remarkable experiment in decentralized planning was introduced in the
State at the initiative of E.M.S. Namboodiripad and as a sequel to the
Peoples' Plan Campaign that EMS had started. Gulati was not a Communist,
but a person of great humaneness and unsullied integrity. His life
constituted, quintessentially, a journey through the contradictions of
post-independence Indian development and his coming closer to the Left
was an eloquent comment on the dialectics of the present epoch in India.
In carrying Prabhat Patnaik's I.S. Gulati memorial lecture, delivered
recently at Thiruvananthapuram, as the lead article in the current
number of <I>Social Scientist</I>, we pay our respects to the remarkable
person that was Iqbal Gulati.</P>

<P>Prabhat Patnaik's paper is concerned with showing the complete
theoretical banality underlying the whole host of neo-liberal
propositions on public finance that are now being so assiduously
promoted by international finance capital through its agencies like the
IMF and the World Bank and through the spokesmen of our own national
government which is in thraldom to it. This theoretical banality is not
in the context of any Marxian or radical political economy; it is
established in relation to the tenets of "mainstream" bourgeois
economics itself, which only underscores the view that in the present
epoch sheer ideology replaces theory, and "hired prize fighters" (to use
Marx's words) replace honest thinkers even in the realm of bourgeois
social sciences.</P>

<P>Utsa Patnaik has been writing for some time, including in the pages
of this journal, about the severe underestimation of rural poverty in
the official estimates. Her argument has been that since poverty is
defined with respect to a calorie norm, and since we have</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>Social Scientist</I></B></P>

<P>data on expenditure on the basis of which we can directly calculate
the magnitude of poverty, we should simply do so. Instead what the
official estimates do is to take a particular benchmark level of
expenditure above which everyone had the required calorie norm in some
base year, call this benchmark level the "poverty line", update this
line to the present year by using a consumer price index, and then count
everyone below this line as "poor". The magnitude of underestimation of
poverty which this indirect method gives rise to can be seen from the
fact that as against the official figure of 27.09 percent rural
poverty-ratio in 1999-2000 for the country as a whole, the direct
estimate (those having less than 2400 calories per day) gives a figure
of 74.5 percent! In the paper in this volume she looks at the poverty
line of each state and the calorie intake corresponding to that line. It
turns out that in 9 out of 15 major states, the poverty line is put at
such an absurdly low figure (thereby underestimating poverty so grossly)
that the calorie intake corresponding to the poverty line is less than
1800 per person per day which is the lowest permissible level for
working human beings, according to the FAO.</P>

<P>Georg Lukacs's <I>History of Development of the Modern Drama</I>,
written early in his life, has not received the attention it deserves in
the international literature notwithstanding its profound influence on
his immediate circle of friends. A part of the reason lies perhaps in
the problematical-relationship of Lukacs's early writings, marked by a
romantic anti-capitalism, to his later, Marxist, works. Margit Koves, in
her paper, examines Lukacs's <I>Drama-book</I> and discusses the
validity of the usual perceptions of it.</P>
