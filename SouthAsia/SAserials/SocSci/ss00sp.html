 Editorial Note

 <P>	The incorrectness of methodological individualism, which takes the 
individual agent as the starting point of analysis, and which characterises 
much of bourgeois social theory, especially in the realm of economics, does 
not arise from the mere empirical fact that in the actual social universe we 
see collective, or supra-individual, actors; it arises from two basic 
considerations: first, these collectives are qualitatively different from, 
and cannot be reduced to, mere "coalitions" of individuals; and, secondly, 
starting from the individual we can never explain a whole range of observed 
phenomena, not just historically significant ones such as social 
revolutions, but even such quotidienne ones as the existence of involuntary 
unemployment under capitalism. Indeed "mainstream" bourgeois economics is 
forced to deny the very existence of involuntary unemployment, while 
heterodox bourgeois writers who do recognise its existence are forced 
willynilly to fall back on some concept of a collective, distinct from 
"coalitions" of individuals, to explain this existence. Prabhat Patnaik in 
his article in the current number of <i>Social Scientist</i> sees this as a 
vindication of the Marxist approach to social analysis, an answer to the 
question: why should we at all be interested in the Marxist concept of 
class? He goes on to explore not only why class as a collective can not be 
replaced by any other concept of a collective, even in societies like ours, 
but also why class categories should be privileged over other categories.

<p>	Javeed Alam has for some time been engaged in a project of 
considerable importance, namely to rescue "modernity" from its exclusive 
association with a predatory capitalism, and to argue instead for a 
"modernity" freed of bourgeois encumbrances. As part of his argument he 
draws a distinction, between "entrenched modernity", 

 <P><B>++Page 2</B> <I><B>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</B></I>

<P>which got realised with capitalism, and a possible modernity that could 
represent the embodiment of certain other Enlightenment ideas, which were 
left untapped after what got embodied, and which according to him constitute 
an "untapped surplus". Instead of turning our backs upon "modernity", he 
argues, we have to tap this "untapped surplus"; but the realisation of ariy 
alternative to the "entrenched modernity" requires according to him, among 
other things, an allout struggle against imperialism which is out to swallow 
our civilisation.

<p>	Alam's defence of "modernity" against its opponents, while it is 
extremely interesting, raises a number of issues which are in need of wider 
discussion. For instance the relationship of his argument with the Marxist 
problematic, as commonly understood, remains unclear; indeed even the place 
of the concept of "modernity" within such a problematic is a matter that 
requires further examination. To initiate a discussion on these issues we 
publish in this number a long review article by Sasheej Hegde on Alam's book 
<i>India: Living with Modernity</i>, where Alam has discussed a number of 
issues, such as nationalism, communalism, democracy, and Inda's 
post-independence political history from his theoretical perspective.

<p>	Finally we publish a study by Indrani Sen on the construction of 
women in some of Rudyard Kipling's literary texts. In his writings concerned 
with the white woman in the colony, Kipling generally perceives the power of 
white female sexuality as a threat to the maintenance of colonial power 
relations and gender hierarchies. While in this respect he echoes perhaps 
the views that were quite pervasive among his contemporaries, he is, 
intriguingly, somewhat more understanding in some of his writings about the 
Indian woman. The reason for this difference, according to the author, may 
have more to do with his perception of the Indian women as unthreatening for 
the colonial project, than with any questioning of racial prejudices, though 
on rare occasions he does appear to contest such prejudices.
