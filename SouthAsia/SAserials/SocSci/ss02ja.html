<P>Editorial Note</P>

<P>Economics is perhaps the most imperialist-dominated subject. This is
hardly surprising. If ideas are conditioned by their material context,
and the dominant ideas are those that reflect the interests of the
dominant classes, then this must be particularly true of ideas about the
material context itself, i.e. economic ideas; in a world marked by the
dominance of international finance capital, it is only to be expected
that the dominant strand in economics should bear the imprint of its
ideology.</P>

<P>An important part of this ideology (and the word is used here in the
precise sense in which Marx had used it, as a contrast to science) is
the view that governments under all circumstances must keep their
budgets balanced (or at the most have a strictly limited deficit). This
proposition which had been the gospel in an earlier period of hegemony
of finance capital (which however had been of a different kind from its
current progeny), had disastrous consequences in that period. Its
theoretical vacuity had been exposed by the Keynesian-Kaleckian
revolution in economics. (Indeed Joan Robinson, the outstanding
Cambridge economist, with her characteristic bluntness, had called it
the "humbug of finance"). This "humbug" in turn had been instrumental in
the imposition of a generally deflationary policy everywhere, much to
the liking of finance capital.</P>

<P>As finance capital in a new form has re-established its hegemony,
deflation is back in vogue and the "humbug of finance" has once again
become fashionable theory. The sociology of how the hegemony of the
ideology of finance capital gets established in the discipline of
economics, the myriad different subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which a
host of brilliant young students, including from the third world, get
coerced, year in and year out, into accepting it, is a fascinating
inquiry in itself. That however is outside the scope of the current
issue of <I>Social Scientist</I>. What the lead article by Utsa Patnaik
establishes, after tracing the theoretical genealogy of the "humbug of
finance", is the damage that deflation is doing to the livelihoods of
millions of people. She does so with a wealth of data drawn from
different parts of the world.</P>

<P>If ideology is purveyed in the garb of science in the realm of
economics in the contemporary period, the term "science" itself</P>

<P>p. 2	<B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>becomes a dirty word in several other realms. The hegemony of
globalized finance is associated with an assault on reason, which, even
if unwittingly, creates the intellectual climate for the emergence of
fundamentalism, communal-fascism, and other such tendencies. Terms like
"secularism" and "rationalism" come under attack even from
"sophisticated" intellectual quarters which, though themselves opposed
to these tendencies, facilitate the thriving of forces such as
<I>Hindutva</I>. This aspect is highlighted in the Haksar memorial
lecture of the eminent historian Satish Chandra which we carry in the
current number.</P>

<P>Sukumari Bhattacharji in her article on Valmiki <I>Ramayana</I> uses
the text to establish the changes occurring in society in the period of
roughly four hundred years bifurcated by the beginning of the Christian
era. Rama's killing of Shambuka and rejection of Sita reflect a social
order marked by the subservience of women and the lower castes. Both
these developments in turn are associated with the accumulation of
private property which gives rise to an emphasis on lineage and to a
fear of miscegenation. The king now acquires a new role, as a guardian
of the caste-system who ruthlessly puts down any Shudra challenge to
Brahmanical domination, and as a protector of the order from the
self-assertion Qf women. The concept of <I>Ramarajya</I> invoked in the
modern context, it follows, has rather unsavoury connotations.</P>

<P>Finally we publish a note by Ram Singh on intellectual property
rights, which examines a range of issues that do not normally figure in
discussions on the subject. It argues for instance that the TRIPS regime
has very weak philosophical foundations.</P>
