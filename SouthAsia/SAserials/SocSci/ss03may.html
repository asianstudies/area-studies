<P>INTRODUCTION / <A HREF="#mhussain">MAZHAR HUSSAIN</A></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2"><I>Perspectives on Urdu Language and Education
in India</I></FONT></CENTER>

<P>In the present language scenario in India, the ruling class ought to
reckon with an accomplished fact that all the languages incorporated in
the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, including official
Hindi, assume a minority status, for a whole variety of reasons, in
those regions where they are not the principal languages. And the
inevitable corollary of that is that different regions of the country
have gradually become multilingual. In this language scenario the case
of Urdu is decidedly unusual. The Urdu-speaking population is spread all
over the country yet remains a linguistic minority everywhere. For
centuries Urdu has been a language of people of all faiths. But
political and economic exigencies have largely been narrowing down the
base of the language to a religious minority. Its process began with the
renouncement of the language by protagonists of Hindi in the late
nineteenth century. Since then the language has gradually and largely
been abandoned by them only to be claimed by Muslim religious minority
as a baby of their own. Let's grant that Urdu is by and large a language
of Muslim religious minority today, does it necessarily preclude the so
called democratic state of India from according a rightful place to the
language in the curricula of school education? Is democracy all about
upholding the rule of majority and caring for their aspirations alone
without respecting the rights of minorities to protect and promote their
language and culture?  The government of all political hues for last
fifty-five years at the centre and state levels have been lacking in
their political will to fulfill the cultural and linguistic aspirations
of minorities. Given the apathy of governments at all levels, how should
linguistic minorities, particularly the Urdu speaking community, protect
and nurture their languages that have been subordinated to the languages
of majorities in different regions and how should they get a rightful
place for their languages on secular school curricula in the democratic
polity like India?</P>

<P><I>Page 2 Introduction</I></P>

<P>Keeping in view the cultural significance of issues, an
interdisciplinary conference entitled 'Minorities, Education and
Language in 21st Century Indian Democracy: The Case of Urdu' was held at
India International Centre, New Delhi, from February 8 to 11, 2002. The
four-day international conference was organized by Zakir Husain Study
Circle and Modern Education Foundation, New Delhi, under the auspices of
the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi, and Konrad
Adenauer Foundation, Germany. Scholars working in areas of education,
law, religion, history, political science, sociology, linguistics,
literature and culture studies converged to deliberate on the issues at
stake from the USA, the UK, and Germany and from different regions of
India as well. Thus the conference achieved its principal aim by
bringing together scholars from diverse academic disciplines.</P>

<P>The conference initiated an academic debate about the study of
problems faced by linguistic minorities especially the Urdu-speaking
community in India. The conference attempted for the first time to
address the issues of Urdu in curricula of secular education that have
been disregarded for the last fifty-five years. It also raised the
question of how modern Muslims should respond to a pluralistic Indian
society and what should be the nature of their education. The
Urdu-speaking scholars participating in the conference unanimously
recommended the Muslims to pursue secular education and urged upon the
Government to desist from promoting Madrasas and by implication all
religious institutions. And this conference, again perhaps for the first
time, advocated equal opportunities and facilities for developing and
learning all Indian languages irrespective of whether or not they are
incorporated in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution. It was a
significant achievement of the conference. The conference demanded that
the State provide all minorities with facilities for elementary
education in their mother tongue. It becomes all the more important in
the case of Urdu linguistic minority in that a majority of them cannot
afford private education in their own mother tongue. Furthermore, like
other languages, Urdu should also be offered as an elective subject to
those pupils for whom it is not a first language.</P>

<P>Different scholars representing wide spectrum of academic disciplines
partly or wholly proposed some of the ameliorative measures outlined
above. Five papers that were first presented at the conference are
published in this special issue of <I>Social Scientist</I>. Yogesh
Tyagi's paper, "Some Legal Aspects of Minority Languages in India'
presents the issue of minority language and education in legal</P>

<P><I>Page 3 Introduction</I></P>

<P>perspective. The paper defines the concept of minority languages in
legal terms and delineates the constitutional safeguards, and domestic
and international legal obligations with regard to minority languages.
It argues that a language that is in majority at one place, is a
minority language at another place. Majority languages not only prosper
along with minority languages but the development of the latter can also
contribute to the development of the former. The paper refers to the
Articles of the Indian Constitution that seek to protect the rights of
linguistic minorities.</P>

<P>Barbara B. Metcalf's paper, 'Urdu in India in the 21st Century: A
Historians Perspective', explains problems of Urdu language and
education that have been multiplied because of their 'conflation' with
Muslims of India who are mainly poor, inadequately represented in
education, professions and government. The paper informs that
dissemination of 'knowledge of Urdu' may be desirable but would not be
able to solve all the problems. Contrarily, it may lead to enclaving the
Muslim community. Finally, it presents two proposals before the
concerned Urdu speakers in India for consideration. First, publications
of Urdu be available in Urdu and Nagri biscripts on facing pages in
order to broaden the base of the language and literature. Second, if the
three-language formula is not implemented and the option for instruction
in mother tongue is not available, or such option in primary classes is
not viable because it lacks basic facilities, 'Urdu script and
vocabulary as a second language at a later point' may be added 'after
the child has acquired basic skills and grammar via Nagri'.</P>

<P>Jagdish S. Gundara's paper entitled 'Linguistic Diversity in Global
Multicultural Civic Polities: The Case of Urdu in India' looks at the
'issues of linguistic diversity' from the contemporary perspective of
globalization. It suggests that in India the linguistic diversity should
be viewed as a 'connective issue' as provided for in Article 29 and 30
of the Constitution of India. Furthermore, the Government should utilize
the 86th Amendment to the Indian Constitution as 'an ideal opportunity
to grant Urdu the status of first language of children from ages of six
to fourteen since they have a fundamental right to education'. The paper
argues that the first language is the best medium for learners at
primary level of education, which also helps them acquire the second
language successfully. For this reason, it advocates that facilities for
the teaching of Urdu ought to be made available in primary schools not
only to the first language learners but also to those students whose
first language is other than Urdu. If this</P>

<P><I>Page 4 Introduction</I></P>

<P>proposition is translated into action, it would aid the former
category of students in the acquisition of second and third languages
and at the same time bring about 'intercultural understanding' with the
latter category of students.</P>

<P>David Matthews, paper on 'Urdu Language and Education in India', lays
emphasis on the distinguished secular character and richness of Urdu
literature from an early age and its contribution to culture, society
and history of India. It brushes aside the debate on Urdu script by
proclaiming that Urdu and its script are one and the same. The paper
considers Urdu as the language of bazaar, cities and many regions of
India as it was at the time of Partition and it still serves 'as the
major lingua franca throughout the whole of the subcontinent'. It has
significant presence in some of the important countries of the world.
Because of its cultural significance, Urdu has assumed the status of
'fourth most widely studied foreign language in the UK after French,
German and Spanish'. But regrettably it has been persecuted in the
country of its origin and ousted from secular education system. The
paper refutes the suggestion of nurturing 'Urdu through Self Help' and
invokes the relevant Articles of the Indian Constitution in favour of
primary education for pupils in their own mother tongue. For the present
state of Urdu, it also holds Urdu speaking community partially
responsible and proposes some concrete suggestions to ameliorate the
deplorable situation in which Urdu finds itself.</P>

<P>The experience of teaching Urdu and Hindi in the USA informs Daniel
Gold's essay on 'The Appeal of Urdu: Its Significance and Potential'.
Realizing the cultural validity of the language as a medium of
instruction, the essay lays stress on the need for Urdu speaking pupils
to be taught at primary level in their own mother tongue. Since the
present political scenario is not very encouraging, some political
pressure and manoeuvring is required for Urdu-speaking community to
achieve the desired goal 'without stirring communal passions'. The essay
suggests that Urdu literature should be also published in Nagri script
for which the language has a great deal of appeal but its literature is
not available in the script they know. To make good use of, the appeal
of Urdu, it proposes to introduce the language at the later stages of
secondary schools as an optional basic course for whom it is not a first
language and for the first language learners at the early stages of
secondary school because for the latter it is better late than
never.</P>
