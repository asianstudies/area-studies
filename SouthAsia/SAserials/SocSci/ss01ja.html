<b>Editoial Note</b>

<p> Much of the current number of <i>Social Scientist</i> is taken up by
three papers presented at the recently-held session of the Indian
History Congress at Calcutta. Though the papers cover a range of diverse
themes, an underlying unity is provided to them by the fact that each
contests in its own way the communal-fascist positions that are being
propagated at present in the realm of history through the active
deployment of state power. Since even the note by MaliniBhattacharya
constitutes an engagement with the Hindu Right, this engagement can be
seen as the defining characteristic of the current number.

<p> The lead article by Am artya Sen,whichisthetextofhisinaugural
address at the Congress, while roaming felicitously over a wide terrain,
makes the extremely significant point that the "positionality" of
observations and perceptions does not do away with notions of truth and
falsehood: the fact that each observer has a particular perspective and
point of view does not constitute a case for relapsing into relativism,
for treating all perspectives as equally valid, and for denying any
objectivity in the writing of history. He goes o n to emphasise the role
of heterodoxy and methodological independence for scientific advance,
tracing the remarkable achievements of early Indian science to the
prevailing atmosphere of tolerance for heterodoxy, which unfortunately
is being undermined in contemporary India.

<p> Iqtadar Alam Khan takes up the claim of the Hindutva forces that
MughalIndia represented the rule of the "Muslim community". He argues on
the basis of a wealth of evidence that the Mughalstate was neither a
Muslim state, where the "Muslim community" in its entirety constituted a
part or the whole of the ruling class, nor an Islamic state where the
<i>Shari</i>'a prevailed. While it was a state based on class
antagonism, the ruling nobility was a composite one in which the
Rajputs,the Marathas,the pre-M ughalIndian Muslims, the Shias from Iran,
and the Turanis were all represented; in fact in the last twenty years
of A urangzeb'sreign the proportion of the Hindus was about a third
among the nobles of the highest category. At the same time, the
oppressed included the peasants, the labourers and the artisans among
whom again there were both Hindus and Muslims. The composite nature of
the Mughal nobility was parallelled by a supra-religious concept of
sovereignty which held that "the

<p><b>p. 2 	SOCIAL SCIENTIST</b>

<p>benevolence and protection of the Emperor should be equally extended
to all the subjects without making any distinction on the basis of
religion or race." Such a concept left little scope for the operation of
the <i>Shari'a</i>. The Mughals might have been oppressive, but they
contributed to the formation of the idea of India.

<p> Making the "Indo-Europeans and other Aryan people" migrants from
India, indeed from the banks of the "Saraswati",appropriating the Indus
civilisation for the "Aryans" by renaming it the "Saraswati
civilisation", and, towards this end, pushing the date of the Rigveda
back to the early Holocene period, has been one of the long-standing
projects of the Hindutva groups. A recent attempt to identify a horse in
the Harappa seals to prove the Aryan origin of the Harappa culture was
part of the same project and was shown up for what it was, a crude
dissimulation.  <i>Social Scientist</i> has made every effort to keep
its readers informed about these issues, and has accordingly published
several pieces in this area in past numbers. Irfan Habib's paper belongs
to this genre. It is a detailed and painstaking effort to follow the
course of the "mighty Saraswati river" which no longer exists, and
reaches the conclusion that it never existed. It follows that "all
claims built upon the greatness of the River Saraswatiare nothing but
castles in the air."

<p> Finally, Malini Bhattacharya's note discusses the case of the
Vrindavan widows to reach a wider conclusion, namely the sharp
distinction drawn by the "anti-secularist" critics of communalism,
between "religion as faith" and "religion as ideology", lacks substance:
"religion as faith" provides the social substratum out of which
"religion as ideology" emerges.
