<P>Editorial Note</P>

<P>When the current number of <I>Social Scientist</I> was in press we
learnt of the sad demise of Professor RR.Brahmananda the renowned
economist who was a stalwart of the Bombay School. Brahmananda was
extraordinarily original as well as prolific. The reactions to different
segments of his overall output therefore were naturally quite varied:
some would find certain parts of his work leaving a lasting impression
but not certain other parts, while others would see nuggets of wisdom in
these latter parts that they consider to be quite unmatched in the
former. Absolutely nobody, however, could afford to ignore what
Brahmananda had to say on any subject at any time, because behind
everything he wrote there was a combination of passion and intellectual
force that was quite unique.</P>

<P>From Brahmananda's substantial written output, at least two
contributions in my view would be generally recognized as absolutely
outstanding. The first is his work, together with his teacher C.N.Vakil,
on the wage-goods bottleneck in underdeveloped economies. It would not
be unfair to surmise that Brahmananda's contribution in the formation
and development of this idea was much more than what is suggested by
joint authorship. The idea itself however was a pioneerin b one. It
would appear later in the works of a host of outstanding development
economists from Ragnar Nurkse to Michael Kalecki, but Vakil and
Brahmananda's <I>Planning for an Expanding Economy</I> clearly takes
precedence.</P>

<P>The second contribution was his lengthy three part review of Piero
Sraffa's <I>Production of Commodities by means of Commodities</I> in the
pages of the <I>Indian Economic Journal</I> which interpreted Sraffa to
the economics profession both in India and abroad (so necessary at a
time when even Roy Harrod had totally misunderstood Sraffa in his review
of the book in the <I>Economic Journal</I>, prompting Sraffa himself, so
reticent and modest a person, to take the most unusual step of writing a
rejoinder to a review). What is more, Brahmananda's work on Sraffa
stimulated a good deal of interest in the subject among researchers in
the Bonbay University, from among whom Krishna Bharadwaj was to emerge
as Sraffa's closest disciple. Brahmananda's interest in Sraffa waned
subsequently, though not before he had discovered an earlier
presentation of some of the Sraffian ideas in the</P>

<P>p. 2 <B><I>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</I></B></P>

<P>work of Ramsay, but his review of <I>Production of Commodities</I>
remains an excellent introduction to Sraffian ideas, which,
notwithstanding their temporary eclipse at present, constitute a
fascinating branch of economic thought.</P>

<P>Brahmananda's legacy however does not remain confined only to his
academic contributions. What was remarkable about him, above everything
else, was his absolute and passionate commitment to economics as a
subject. He was simply mad about it. Indeed the term "wedded to a
subject" could not have a truer meaning than what Brahmananda displayed
towards economics. He introduced generations of students to the grandeur
of the subject, and thereby contributed to the creation of an economics
profession in the country. He was of course remarkably erudite and
meticulous: many would recollect his critique of the Eleventh Finance
Commission's report which was so incisive that it belied the age of the
author. But this erudition and meticulousness derived from an attitude
of reverence towards the subject, and indeed towards academic activity
in general which is so scarce these days but which is the bedrock on
which the academic universe is built. His death is an irreparable loss
to the discipline of economics, to academic life in the country and to
his numerous admirers among whom I count myself.</P>

<P>The current number of <I>Social Scientist</I> covers very diverse
themes. In the first of the two historical articles K.N.Panikkar sees
the current conjuncture in the country as entailing a choice between the
legacies of Renaissance and revivalism, both of which sprang from the
search for identity in a colonial context, while in the second, Shireen
Ratnagar makes a strong case for a <I>sui generis</I> study of tribal
society, free of misconceptions such as "tribes have been with us since
`time immemorial"' or that "tribal life is inherently `backward"' etc.
In the only economics article in this issue Richard Duffee argues that
the difference between the Purchasing Power Parity value of a currency
and its official exchange rate can provide a measure of exploitation
through unequal exchange. Kishore Theckedath's piece on Dialectics and
Cosmology provides an exhaustive overview of the theoretical debates in
Cosmology. It leans towards the Quasi Steady State Cosmology of Hoyle,
Narlikar and Burbridge as against the Big Bang theory of the origin of
the Universe, and sees a confirmation of dialectical materialism in the
former. The note by Nishad Patnaik attempts to trace the roots of Martin
Heidegger's engagement with Nazism to that element in his philosophy
which assimilates all <I>praxis</I> to thinking.</P> </FONT>
