Editorial Note<p>

Aijaz Ahmad's lead article in the current number of
<i>Social Scientist</i> characterises <i>The Communist
Manifesto</i> as a transitional text within the overall
<i>oeuvre</i> of Marxism. Precisely for this reason however
the <i>Manifesto</i> is both rich and complex, in the sense
of being marked by the co-presence of ideas belonging to
different levels of perception and hence open to vastly
divergent interpretations. The author illustrates this
complexity with reference to the famous passage in the
<i>Manifesto</i> where Marx and Engels talk about "national
one sidedness and narrow-mindedness" becoming "more and more
impossible" and "a world literature" arising "from the
numerous national and local literatures". Marx and Engels
saw the movement towards the creation of a "world
literature" not as the outcome of the activity of a group of
high-minded intellectuals pursuing a desirable goal, but as
a process inherent in the bourgeoisie's need for a
constantly expanding market. Notwithstanding the remarkable
perspicuity of the vision conveyed by the passage, however,
it still remains open to divergent interpretations. On the
one hand it can be seen simply as an anticipation of a
process of globalisation in general and of an accompanying
intensification of cultural exchanges to a point where 
something like a "world literature" begins to emerge; the
<i>Manifesto</i>'s anticipation, even on this
interpretation, may appear to many to be in the process of
getting realised. There is on the other hand however a hint
of an awareness in the same passage of the hierarchical
nature of the "globalisation" and of the "world literature"
that it brings forth (in the reference for instance to the
bourgeoisie's  "compelling" all nations to adopt "what it
calls civilisation"). It is this hierarchical process, Ahmad 
argues, that is getting realised today. For a true "world
literature" to emerge the logic of the capitalist world
market has to be transcended.<p>

	We also publish in the current number a set of articles by
Russian scholars on the Russian economy, which were presented at a
seminar<p>
	
<b>++Page 2</b> <i><b>SOCIAL SCIENTIST</b></i><p> 

in Calcutta some time ago. We are pleased to be able to do
so for several reasons: first, it is rarely that we in India
have any access to writings on the Russian economy by
Russian scholars; much of our information comes from Western
"advisers" to Russia, or Indian scholars on brief visits, or
even the London <i>Economist</i>. Secondly, the scholars we
are publishing are not mere analysts gathered together at
random, but subscribe to a certain common economic programme
for the overcoming of the crisis, and hence constitute some
sort of a platform, which makes their endeavour more
interesting. Thirdly, several of the problems discussed by
them are instructive in the context of our own economy once
it has got launched on the trajectory of financial
liberalisation. The conclusion of Glaziev's paper that "it
is necessary to relinquish the IMF-imposed dogmas of the
'Washington Consensus"' would no doubt strike a chord in
most of our readers.
