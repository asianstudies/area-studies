<font size="+4"><b>S</b></font>imple times, such as ours, have no use for complex characters.
As such, it is not surprising that Swami Sahajanand Saraswati has either
been forgotten
altogether or has been reduced to a simple, one-dimensional cut-out of a
leader of the bhumihar caste. For, the Swami was as complex a person as is
possible and simple-minded souls who rule today would have immense
difficulty in coping with such complexity of personality.
 
<p>
First of all, Sahajanand was a Swami,a <i>danda</i>-bearing <i>sanyasi</i>, who
had renounced the world. He was learned in the scriptures and deeply
familiar with the traditions of Indian religious philosophy. As such, his
interpretative <I>Gita Hridaya</I> still stands as one of the most
interesting commentaries on that much commented on text.
 
<p>
But then, Swami Sahajanand Saraswati was much more than a mere literate
mendicant. He was also a tireless campaigner on social issues. In
particular, he was the foremost leader of the peasants of India in the
first half of this century and he helped set up their first formal
organisation through the All India Kisan Sabha. Even in this respect, Swami
Sahajanand's vision was far more radical than that of his celebrated
contemporaries like the late Prof N. G. Ranga who concentrated largely on
the problems of the commercial farmers who had marketable agricultural
surplus. Sahajanand was equally concerned with poor peasants and, as Walter
Hauser's excellent edition of a forgotten manuscript of <I>Khet Mazdoor</I> 
makes it clear, also with agricultural labourers.
 
<p>
Besides, Swami Sahajanand was also a campaigner for what is nowadays
simplistically sloganised as &quot;social justice&quot;. Today's dominant
castes,which are so vociferous in their opposition to the Mandalisation
process,would do well to remember that it was only decades ago that many of
themselves were socially discriminated against. The land-tilling brahmins,
like bhumihars, tyagis and anavils, were looked down upon by
non-cultivating and non-working brahmins and had to struggle under the
leadership of people like Sahajanand to assert social self respect. The 
<I>Brahman Vamsa Charitra</I> by Sahajanand provided the intellectual
ammunition for that fight just as the scholarship of Dr B. R. Ambedkar has
been the guiding light for the dalits.
 
<p>
Swami Sahajanand Saraswati was also one of the most important leaders of
the freedom struggle who brought a &quot;subaltern&quot; content into
nationalism.It was Sahajanand who, more than anyone else, elevated the
peasants from the footnote to the text of the patriotic struggle of the
Indian people for liberation from colonialism. In the bargain,he had severe
disagreements with the likes of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Babu Rajendra
Prasad and even Mahatma Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, but the saffron-clad 
<I>sadhu</I> continued to stick to his &quot;red&quot; convictions.
 
<p>
Most important, Swami Sahajanand Saraswati was a unique communicator who
understood and adopted both the peasants' aspirations and elements of their
discourse. Challenging the combined might of the British empire and its
toady landlords, in his public meetings the doughty old Swami would wave
his symbolic <I>danda</I> (religious staff) and call out,  
<I>&quot;Kaise logey malguzai?&quot; </I> (How 
will you collect the land rent? ) and the peasants would respond
full-throatedly, <I>&quot;Latth hamara zindabad!&quot;</I> (Long live our
sticks!). The message went home unambiguously.
 
<p>
This religious leader was quite obviously ahead of his times. Well before
the concepts of &quot;economic nationalism&quot; and &quot;subaltern
activism&quot; had become popular, he was living out 
a life which gave meaning to those concepts. Indeed, well before the idea
of the political unit of Jharkhand -- the tribal territory comprising
Chhotanagpur and Santhal Parganas in Bihar and adjoining similar regions in
West Bengal, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh -- was even a gleam in the eyes of
political manipulators, Swami Sahajanand Saraswati had already applied his
mind to the subject of the people of Jharkhand. That is the focus of the
book under review.

<p>
The book is important not only because of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati but
for three other reasons as well.One is that it has been edited by Walter
Hauser and the second is that it has been brought out in a rare bi-lingual
format and the third, of course, is the subject that it deals with.
 
<p>
Among the many scholars who have worked on India in general and Indian
peasants in particular, Walter Hauser should occupy pride of place.Well
before &quot;subalternism&quot; and &quot;peasantism&quot; became
fashionable in academic circles, this scholar from the United States broke
ranks with his fellows who were commenting on India's &quot;quiet
crises&quot; and &quot;dangerous decades&quot; and were otherwise occupying
themselves with macro concerns. At a time when even Indian academics were
mainly groping with caste and kinship, and class was the concern only of 
&quot;disaffected intellectuals&quot; like Daniel Thorner, A. R. Desai and
a handful of others, Walter Hauser 
applied himself to studying the peasantry in its manifestation as a class.
His work on the Bihar Kisan Sabha is pioneering and it is a pity that its
greatly delayed publication is only scheduled for now. Nevertheless,
those -- like the present reviewer -- who have had access <I>to</I> and
benefitted from Walter Hauser's thesis and other published papers can
testify that he broke new ground in getting to know the Indian peasantry
and its organisations.

<p>
Through these years, Walter Hauser has continued to work on related themes
and has done invaluable service both to the memory of Swami Sahajanand as
well as to scholarship on the peasant question by bringing to lightsome
inaccessible manuscripts of that great peasant leader. This book follows
another volume, <I>Sahajanand on Agricultural Labour and the Rural
Poor</I> (New Delhi: Manohar, 1994).
 
<p>
A significant aspect of both these books is that they contain four segments
each: an extensive introduction, English translation of the Hindi text,
Sahajanand's original text itself printed in the Devnagari script,and
detailed end-notes. This format makes the volumes immensely useful for
researchers as well as for others who are interested in following the
writings of that unique social <I>sanyasi.</I>

<p>
Finally, the book is important because of its subject: the peasants of
Jharkhand. For the last several decades,indeed beginning almost immediately
after the death of Swami Sahajanand Saraswati, the issue of Jharkhand has
been posed in different ways. There have been demands for the constitution
of the mineral-rich region into a separate &quot;steel state$quot;, for the
formation of an &quot;autonomous tribal region&quot; and the transcending of
present state boundaries in these processes. However, the focus of
attention has always been on the <I>politics</I> of Jharkhand, on which set
of people will control its vast assets. Very little thought has been 
given to the condition of its ordinary people, of its peasants, artisans
and other workers, and the issue of how they live their lives now and how
the formation of a different political unit will affect their lives has
hardly been investigated. Even most Jharkhand activists have been so
obsessed with power that they have hardly bothered with these extremely
important social and economic issues.
 
<p>
Sociologists and anthropologists too have, by and large, failed the
peasants of Jharkhand. When they have cast their finely meshed
academics nets in the waters of Jharkhand, they have only come up with the
familiar fishes of &quot;tribe&quot; and, at the very most,
&quot;caste&quot; even as the water of &quot;class&quot; and
&quot;peasant&quot; have eluded their grasp. They have meticulously
documented ritual and other practices; they have painstakingly noted
endogamy and exogamy; they have carried out detailed examination of
commensuality or otherwise; they have turned &quot;people&quot; <I>(janah:
</I> the closest Sanskrit word to the one by which the 
&quot;tribals&quot; describe themselves) into exotic species. They have even
carried out feverish debates on &quot;whether tribals can be peasants&quot; 
even as, right under their eyes, agriculture has been carried out, surplus
has been extracted and even agrarian resistance has taken place in both
dramatic and everyday forms.

<p>
There have, of course, been notable exceptions among the scholars of
the &quot;tribes&quot; in this regard. Some have indeed noted production,
struggle and organisation but not enough critical information has emerged
on social differentiation and relations of production. The work of K.
Suresh Singh and Ranajit Guha on elementary and other aspects of peasant
insurgency in Jharkhand call for honourable mention in this regard.
However, even these outstanding scholars have tended to over-emphasise the 
&quot;uniqueness&quot; of the $quot;tribals&quot;: their commonality and
yet distinctive organisation with the $quot;general society&quot;, an
aspect that D. D. Kosambi called the characterising feature of all of
India's history, has not received adequate attention. The publication of 
<I>Swami Sahajanand and the Peasants of Jharkhand: A View from 1941,</I> a
hitherto unavailable manuscript of that great peasant leader and
revolutionary intellectual should go along way in filling that gap.

<p>
Sahajanand makes extremely acute observations about the nature of the
peasants of Jharkhand: &quot;The most important fact about the Adivasis of
Jharkhand is that though they are backward, yet they are not so depressed
as are the backward people of Bihar proper or of other areas.There the
backward classes [meaning Untouchable castes] are most often found to <I>be
khet mazdoors [agricultural</I>labourers], or just like <I>khet 
mazdoors,</I> except in those areas where they are in a majority and own
their own fields.The Mundas, Oraons etc. are kisans <I>(pakke kisan)</I> in
the real sense of the term, indeed they have been so for generations. They
love their land as much as they love their jungle. They cannot live without
these two central elements of their lives. The varieties of agricultural
lands which they own and cultivate is proof of this deep attachment. As I
have indicated, a particular tribe <I>(jati)</I> known as
the &quot;Kisan&quot; is found in Jharkhand. I have<p>

<p>
encountered this &quot;Kisan&quot; name only in one other place, in
Farrukhabad in the United Provinces. The word &quot;Krishani&quot; 
prevalent in the Santal Parganas is used in the same sense. The term is
also used to describe a type of <I>bhaoli</I> or <I>batai</I> cultivation
practiced there. This act is also mentioned in the Santal Parganas Inquiry
Committee Report. It is for these reasons and because the Adivasis are true
kisans that I have titled this book <I>Jharkhand ke Kisan,</I> i.e., The
Kisans of Jharkhand rather than <I>Jharkhand ke Niwasi,</I> i.e., The
Inhabitants of Jharkhand. No one other than these Adivasi kisans are the
original inhabitants of this place. The Kurmis and the Gwalas are also true
<I>(pakke)</I> kisans. The Adivasis are a vital and active people. They are
not weak,depressed, and crushed like the Harijans [Untouchables] of
Gangetic  Bihar. Hence if they are organised on the basis of their class
interest <I>(varghii)</I> they can become a powerful force <I>(apurva
shakti)</I> whom no one can crush. They have only recently been deprived of
their freedom <I>(azadi).</I> Hence a feeling of great strength still flows
in their blood.&quot;
 
<p>
Sahajanand wrote this book in Hazaribagh Central Jail where he was
imprisoned in connection with the freedom movement. Thus, he had very
little access to literature and official reports etc. Nevertheless, his
historical insights are so powerful as to stand out even today: &quot;It is
said that the Nagvanshi kings of this region were the original rulers of
Jharkhand and belonged to the families of the Adivasis. According to the
traditional <I>panchayati</I> system the people chose the Nagvanshis to be
their headmen <I>(sardars)</I> and chiefs <I>(mukhiyas),</I> and in the
course of time they became their masters. This has been the history of
feudalism in all countries and here it 
became the foundation of the zamindari system. Until the
Mughal period the relationship with the Nagvanshis was an accepted,
functioning system of rulership. But then the practice of visiting the
Delhi Durbar proved harmful. So long as the Nagvanshis lived in the jungles
of Jharkhand they did not fall prey to the pomp and grandeur of court life
and its evil influences. But frequent visits to the <I>durbar</I> tempted
them to acquire cavalry, elephants and other paraphernalia of the court. It
further led them to indulge in luxurious and licentious living. This
in turn produced retainers to carry this equipment and maintain the cavalry
and elephants. Bands of Sikhs, Pathans and other traders began to
infiltrate the area from the western provinces, bringing with them this
paraphernalia of the courts and other articles and in the process began to
loot the local population. When payment in cash was not available for
these goods, village after village was farmed out to these traders on
contract as payment in revenue. In this way a group of zamindars from the
outside were introduced into the region. Some had come into the area on
other accounts, either as allies or participants in local wars. After
the Year 1765 A.D.some came either in the garb of flatters of the Mughal
 potentates of the area or in the service of their
British masters.  More recently many have settled here  as
traders and merchants while  still  others who  had come earlier
now brought their kith and kin from the outside. Many erected castles and
fortresses to live in the safety of the dense and impenetrable jungle.
 
<p>
&quot;It was the exploitation and pressures  of these outsiders
which ultimately  led to the awakening of the peasants of Jharkhand.
No less than these, the  Marwari merchants and other money-lenders
also took the 
advantage of the peasants. Their hard earned money thus went into the
coffers of these zamindars, Marwaris and moneylenders, literally drawing
into question the very honour and prestige of the Adivasi kisans. The new
British regulations helped these exploiters to squeeze the very lifeblood
out of these simple peasant folk,depriving them of their land and in effect
reducing them to the condition of slaves. They were frequently sent to
prison. All of this ultimately drove 
the kisans of Chhotanagpur to rise in rebellion <I>(bagavaten)</I> times
without number... Last but not the least was the Tana Bhagat movement which
started at the time of the Great European War of 1914 and continued with
great intensity till the Noncooperation movement of 1921. This was clearly
a kisan movement. A powerful group of Tana Bhagats openly refused to pay
rent <I>(lagan)</I> to their zamindars, courted imprisonment, and with the
auction of their lands, they were ruined.

<p>
&quot;When our well known and famous leaders were guiding the course of the
nation's political struggle consequent of the nation's political struggle
consequent on the promulgation of the Rowlatt Act, martial law in the
Punjab, and coupled with it the 
Khilafat agitation, the simple but brave kisans of Jharkhand were waging a
powerful peasant struggle <I>(zabardast larai)</I> at the very same time.
 It was absolutely remarkable to see them refusing to pay any kind of
rent or other taxes. In fact it was they who by their deeds, gave a real
shape to our wider political struggle. This massive demonstration of their
demands was done both in the absence of any education, which they did not
have, or of dramatic words. What after all could they say? Such
sophisticated speeches and agitations were no doubt being carried on by our
leaders throughout the country. Vocal protest was for those leaders, while
demonstration by deed and action fell to the kisans of Jharkhand. As a
matter of fact the Tana Bhagat movement of refusing to pay any land rent
would not have come to a dead stop had Gandhiji not visited Ranchi in
September-October of 1921 and personally persuaded them to withdraw their
demands. Subsequently Congress volunteers went about urging that the Tana
Bhagats must now pay land rent to the zamindar! This is an example both of
our wider politics as well as the true form of the kisan struggle of
Jharkhand. &quot;

<p>
Swami Sahajanand Saraswati brings such insights as well as many others on
systems such as <I>sewakia, kamia</I> and other types of bondage specific
to Jharkhand in this invaluable manuscript. Many of these  issues have
been ignored wilfully or otherwise and only recently have they returned
to the public domain. It is  a measure of Sahajanand's perspicacity
that he noted them decades ago.
 
<p>
This book is, therefore, an extremely important addition to the corpus of
literature on peasant  studies and deserves to become a &quot;primary
source&quot;.<p>
