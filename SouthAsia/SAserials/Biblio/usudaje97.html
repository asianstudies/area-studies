Gramsci was fully aware of the subalterns' 
incapability of thinking the state. Consciously,
as Dipesh Chakrabarty has pointed out, "Once 
the subaltern could imagine/think the state, he
transcended, strictly speaking, the condition of 
subalternity". This remark, if superimposed on
Marx's comment on the French lower peasantry's 
inability of representing themselves, predestines
that the subaltern will not remain as it is when it 
speaks out systematically. Therefore, the
appearance of a "subaltern" scholar in the <b><i>SS</i></b> 
group may be called an epoch-making 
event.</font></center></blockquote>
     

<font size="+4"><b>U</b></font>ndoubtedly one of the most influential 
and concerned intellectual endeavours in
contemporary India, <i><b>Subaltern Studies</b></i> 
(hereinafter referred to as <i><b>SS</b></i>), 
started the publication of its
series in 1982. The latest volume (No. IX) was issued last year. <p>

     The tone of <b><i>SS</i></b>, however, turned markedly 
with Vol. IV published in 1985 and a discursive
shift took place then. After the publication of Vol. VI, 
Ranajit Guha relinquished the overall
charge of editing <b><i>SS</i></b>. Vol. VII was 
issued under joint editorship in 1992. The shift 
in tone that had already begun in Vol. IV got all the 
more marked from this volume onward.<p>

      I would like to point to two basic trends directly relating to the reality of the subalterns.

One is the apparent polarization between the rich and the poor, and a widening gap between the
upper and bottom strata of the poor itself. Another is politicization of various levels/groups, such
as the Backward Classes, NGOs and many citizen's movements on environment, gender, human
rights and so on. In short, the "subaltern" today appears to be no more than a simple entity, silently
waiting to be discovered/represented. <p>

     The shift of <b><i>SS</i></b>, in another sense, should be understood with reference to the global
intellectual trends. The Indian market has been closely linked with the global economic system as a
result of liberalizing processes. Intellectuals too cannot stand aloof from this trend. Even earlier,
their diasporic situation had come into being as part of the colonial legacy. They had already
settled in English-speaking countries in large numbers and established a wide academic network all
over the world. <p>

     Since the beginning of the movement, <b><i>SS</i></b> has developed interdependently with various
related fields of study and academic trends, such as cultural studies, post-colonial,
post-structuralism and post-modernism. This relationship between <b><i>SS</i></b> and relevant fields of global
current intellectual endeavour is, for instance, the reason why <b><i>SS</i></b> has been accepted as a part of
cultural studies or post-colonial studies in the Japanese general intellectual scene.<p>

      Though Partha Chatterjee's lecture on <b><i>SS</i></b> delivered at Tokyo University appeared in
translation two years later in 1987 with an introductory comment by Prof. Nagasaki, it did not
affect Japanese intellectuals at large as it was published in the University Bulletin. In 1990 Gayatri
Chakravorty Spivak's "In Other World" was translated in abridged from. The translators, however,
omitted the "Deconstructing Historiography", article published in <b><i>SS</i></b> 4. This clearly shows the way
Spivak was accepted in Japan. She was introduced before anything else as a rising literary critic in
the US. The Japanese translation of Dipesh Chakrabarty's article appeared in <b><i>Siso</i></b>, one of the
largest selling monthly magazines among intellectuals in its special number on cultural studies.
Most of the readers recognised it as one of the standard works of cultural or post-colonial studies;
the Japanese academic community was, however, not particularly concerned about its Indian
context. In these circumstances, <b><i>SS</i></b> is deemed highly international and, ironically enough,
intellectually 'elite'!<p>

 The shift within <b><i>SS</i></b> may be observed In various aspects. I would like to focus
on just two of them, namely the question of subaltern/elite dichotomy and gender. <p>

     Ranajit Guha eloquently outlined the identification of the two domains, subaltern and elite
in the very first volume of the <b><i>SS</i></b> series. Their conceptualization is indeed the key to the entire
framework of the <b><i>SS</i></b> project. Discovery of subtalterns, who have been silent and had almost
disappeared in the historical discourse, as a substantial entity on which "history from below" could
be constructed was the starting point of scholars gathered in the <b><i>SS</i></b> collective. The foundation of
this new discourse was laid by Guha through his long and assiduous efforts in the UK. His analysis
of the <b><i>Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency in Colonial India</i></b> clearly shows where the
foundation of <b><i>SS</i></b> was laid.<p>

      The essence of his contention was crystallized as a kind of manifesto in an artr1cle entitled
"On Some Aspects of the Historiography of Colonial India" published in the first volume of <b><i>SS</i></b>.
After criticizing elite historiography of Indian nationalism generated by both colonialism and
nationalism, he shows that there existed an autonomous domain of people's or subaltern politics
parallel to that of elite politics. The subaltern classes are identified in terms of the conditions of
exploitation to which they were subjected while engaged in either manual or intellectual labour. In
short, the subaltern classes are considered to form a substantial entity. However, the movements
which arose from among the subaltern classes were not powerful enough to form a full-fledged
struggle for national liberation. Therefore, their story is largely tragic, one of failure. On the other
hand, it is also the story of failure on the part of bourgeois elite, so long as it could not properly
incorporate subaltern in a newly-built nation state. <p>

     Even before the paradigmatic shift took place in <b><i>SS</i></b>, Prof. Amales Tripathi, a leading elite
historian, made a frontal attack upon <b><i>SS</i></b>. He felt that, "Though efforts to write history of the lower
classes have widened and deepened the purview of our knowledge, they have. (also) created many
vacua." He raised three questions. First, "subaltern scholars" cannot give any clear and reasonable
definition of subalterns. Adivasi insurgencies are over- emphasized while protests posed by other
classes are belittled. Besides, the differentiation within adivasi communities should not be ignored
either. Second, <b><i>SS</i></b> also do not take into account the obvious fact that in many cases subalterns
tried to envisage their hopes, longings and dreams in the leadership of elites. Third, by applying
structuralist techniques imprudently, <b><i>SS</i></b> reject the statements of both British and Indian elites, and
thereby the <b><i>SS</i></b> scholars indulge in recursive reading.<p>

      More "regularly left-minded disciplinary historians" seem to take on more or less the same
stance as Tripathi. Prof. Bipan Chandra is no less critical of the <b><i>SS</i></b>, saying "The Subaltern school's
characterization of the national movement bears a disturbing resemblance to the imperialist and
neo- imperialist characterization of the national movement. This approach is also characterized by
a generally ahistorical glorification of all forms of popular militancy and consciousness and equally
a historical contempt for all forms of initiative and activity by the intelligentsia, organised party
leaderships and other elites." <p>

     In the course of the development of <b><i>Subaltern Studies</i></b>, however, the very meaning of the
term "subaltern" seems to have shifted from a substantial entity to a mere conceptual one. Far
from becoming clearer and more reasonable, the concept of "subaltern" has been further entangled
and made more complex. Participants in various movements on environment, gender, human
rights and so on are so diversely intersected that none of them is attributable to any decisively
marked substantial entity. It is here that rather loosely conceptualized "subaltern" is able to
subsume all such drifting participants in multifarious movements under a single category. <p>

     Yet it should be borne in mind that <b><i>SS</i></b> scholars do not exclude the domain of elite politics
from their project. The phase of overlapping of the domains has been duly emphasized from the
very beginning. However, it was mentioned in Vol. 1 itself that "the braiding together of the two
strands of elite and subaltern politics led invariably to explosive situations". Nevertheless, after the
second shift (1992), <b><i>SS</i></b> came 

(<b>++Page 16</b>)

 to be criticized for neglecting the subalterns. Increasing number of articles on <b><i>bhadralok</i></b> (Bengali
Hindu middle class) society gave substance to the criticism. it was said that <b><i>SS</i></b> had turned to
<b><i>Bhadralok Studies</i></b>! This tendency arose out of the growing concern about the subaltern position of
women in <b><i>bhadralok</i></b> society. This was, presumably in the judgement of the members of the <b><i>SS</i></b>
collective, an enlargement of their project. However, those who stick to the old concept of
"subaltern" as a substantial entity see a deviation from the original intention. Extension of the
concept of "subaltern" is a product of social changes and an incentive toward intellectual
innovations as well. <p>

     The third point of Tripathi's criticism regarding recursive reading is important. Howsoever
easily accept- able a criticism against international misreading (such as regarding a rogue as a
protester) may be, it is an indispensable means to approach subalterns. Without the sense or will to
read against the grain, nobody will be engaged in <b><i>SS</i></b>. This is manifested if we read Vivek
Dhareshwar and R. Srivatsan's fine article on "rowdy- sheeters" (criminals on the black list) in
Andhra Pradesh (<b><i>SS</i></b> IX). In the last section of their article, they say, "The figure of the "rowdy"
emerges, and constantly duplicates itself, the very heart of the political discourse whose conditions
of possibility is, paradoxically, the split or double-doubling (between the legal-political-moral
subject and empirical subject of political technologies) that it tries to overcome." <p>

     <b><i>SS</i></b> is obviously an intellectual project which involves many theoretical difficulties. In <b><i>SS</i></b>
IV, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak sums up the precarious position of <b><i>SS</i></b> in the following words:
"Yet, since a 11 reading against the grain" must forever remain strategic, it can never claim to have
established the authoritative truth of a text, it must forever remain dependent upon practical
exigencies, never legitimately lead to a theoretical orthodoxy. In the case of the <b><i>SS</i></b> group, it would
get the group off the dangerous hook of claiming to establish the true- knowledge of the subaltern
and his consciousness. <p>

     However, let me return to a simple question. Is it right that <b><i>SS</i></b> remains as an intellectual
project promoted only by elite schools? Has not there been a shift in the subaltern classes them-
selves? And is the shift reflected in <b><i>SS</i></b>? It is only in the latest volume of the series that we can find
an article written by a scholar of subaltern origin. Heretofore the pages of <b><i>SS</i></b> have largely been
occupied by upper caste men, so far as the family names of contributors indicate. In Volume IX,
Kancha Ilaiah has contributed an article entitled "Productive Labour Consciousness and History:
The Dalitbahujan Alternative" as self-consciously the first scholar of subaltern origin. <p>

     When I thought of the absence of scholars of subaltern origin, I used to recall a Japanese
short poem: "When a cowherd makes a poem, new styles of poetry arise in great numbers."
Although it appears to be a good-for-nothing piece without any appeal to our mind now, it is a
famous <b><i>haiku</i></b> repeatedly reproduced in school textbooks. Sachio Itoh (1864-1913), author of this
poem, was one of the innovators of a traditional style of poetry and a dairy farmer by profession.
This style of poetry has been loved by the Japanese including innumerable commoners. Yet, we
must admit that his movement ultimately dwindled away to a rather self-satisfied organisation
which supported imperialist-fascism. How about subalterns of India in the 1990's.? <p>

 <font size="+1">Gramsci was fully aware of the subalterns' incapability of thinking the state. Consciously,
as Dipesh Chakrabarty has pointed out, "Once the subaltern could imagine/think the state, he
transcended, strictly speaking, the condition of subalternity". This remark, if superimposed on
Marx's comment on the French lower peasantry's inability of representing themselves, predestines
that the subaltern will not remain as it is when it speaks out systematically. Therefore, the
appearance of a "subaltern" scholar in the <b><i>SS</i></b> group may be called an epoch-making 
event.</font>
However, there still lie many difficult problems to be solved for the intellectual progress and
accumulation of cultural capital on the part of subaltern classes. <p>

     On another matter, in the first three volumes of <b><i>SS</i></b>, women were not taken up as the theme
of any article. Spivak comments on attitude of <b><i>SS</i></b> group towards women as follows: "The group is
scrupulous in its consideration towards women. They record moments when men and women are
joined in struggle, when their conditions of network or education suffer from gender or class
discrimination. But I think they overlook how important the concept-metaphor woman is to the
function of their discourse." <p>

     What were neglected in early <b><i>SS</i></b> can be summed up in the following points. First, the
instrumentality of women was important in the shifting of the function of discursive system as
insurgent mobilisation. Yet the discursive possibility of women is seldom raised by the group.
Second, woman's subjugation is generally dissolved into the solidarity of the subaltern community.
As a result, the subjectivity or subject-positioning of the the woman is placed outside the research
agenda. There is the complicity between the subject and object of investigation, that is, the male
historian and the patriarchal subaltern. Much more attention should be paid to the problem of
women's subjugation which was brought about by the exchange of women even in subaltern
communities. In this sense, Partha Chatterjee's attempt to consider the clash between kinship and
politics is noteworthy. Third, today women's subjugation assumes a different character from that
of colonial days. The combination of pre-existing structures of patriarchy and trans- national
capitalism brings much misery to the urban sub-proletarian female who is a typical victim of the
global economic system. <p>

     Spivak deconstructed the discourse of <b><i>SS</i></b> in this manner thus pushing its narrative of
goddesses towards that of living subaltern women. It was again Spivak who wrote the first article
on women for <b><i>SS</i></b>. She translated a Bengali short story written by Mahasweta Devi and contributed
an article analysing it for Volume V Spivak's deconstructive reading paved the way for
multifarious possibilities relating to the women's question. Roughly speaking, her consideration is
related to nationalism (in her criticism of the author's explanation), analysis of labour and capital
(in her discussion on Marxist feminism), feminism in international situation (in her comment on
liberal feminism), psychoanalysis (in her consideration of a theory of woman's body) and religion
(in her discussion on gendering). <p>

     It is, of course, simplification to sum up her elaborate discourse in this manner. Yet, by the
wide coverage of her discussion, we may understand that the scope of women's studies was
expanded. Let us see Spivak's approach in her own words: "Used as a text, 'Stanadayini" calls into
question that aspect of western Marxist feminism which, from the point of the work, trivialises the
theory of value and, from the view point of mothering as work, ignores the mother as subject. It
calls into question that western liberal feminism which privileges the indigenous or diasporic elite
from the Third World and identifies Woman with the reproductive or copulative body." <p>

     After Spivak's powerful intervention, arguments about gender appear to have taken the two
different courses. One is the endeavour to understand the changing front of the contemporary
women's question within the frame- work of the nationalist movement. The other stance, though
mainly historic in perspective, has a close relation with the contemporary situation. It is because
.the nation-wide patriarchal mobilisation of the Hindu Divine Mother and Holy Child" which is the
target of criticism in Mahasweta Devi's "Standayini" is a negative legacy inherited from the
nationalist movement. <p>

     The former course expressed itself in volume VI of the series. Julie Stephens contributed
an article entitled "Feminist Fictions: A Critique of the Category 'Non-western Woman' in Feminist
Writings on India." It is a bold theoretical attack upon westernized Indian feminists like Madhu
Kishwar. Her contention is that westernized Indian feminists, in ardent pursuit of their Indian
cultural construction, have lost sight of the importance of women as subjects and subaltern women
are always beyond their reach. Susie Tharu, in her "Response to Julie Stephens" also published in
the same volume, naturally, deplores the latter's "supercilious" distance from "the muddy world" in
which Indian feminist workers "live and fight" within apparent limitation. This is what may be
called a bad example of intervention from outside. However, faults should be attributed not to this
young Australian postgraduate student but to the <b><i>SS</i></b> group who, I suppose, were eager to give
wider outlook to their women studies.<p>

     In the latest volume of the <b><i>SS</i></b>, Susie Tharu herself has a fine article on the contemporary
women's movements. Various type of movements, such as the anti-Mandal agitation, the politics of
contraceptive choice, the feminism of the Hindu Right and anti-arrack movement are placed under
her security. All these occurred in the early 1990's which, according to Tharu, "represent a turning
point for Indian feminism". They definitely point to a new phase of feminism which cannot be
gauged with "established" gender theory. For example, the Mandal issues questioned the validity of
gender theory built on the liberal model. Pro~ Mandal groups we re accused that they were
retrogressive supporters of casteism. In the politics of contraceptive choice, privacy, autonomy,
and empowerment is now on the agenda of multi-national capital. What is more, powerful feminist
lobbies such as the s Feminist Majority in the USA endorse these claims. Thus, under pressure of
liberalization and globalization of economics, neo-nationalism has deeply affected the upper strata
of Indian society while internationalization is going on as self-evident process.<p>

     Many interests intersect one another, as a result of which campaigns and movements,
whether feminist or democratic, are promoted on a rather limited scale or by loosely-knit
organizations. Anti-arrack movements in Andhra Pradesh illustrate this. Women, irrespective of
their religion, caste or classes unite to prevent arrack from entering their village, but they never try
to collaborate with any movement of the same kind beyond the village boundary. Susie Tharu's
article conveys a vivid picture and problems of the contemporary movement involving women of
India. <p>

     The second trend of discussion on women's problems is largely historical. Historians like
Partha Chatterjee and Dipesh Chakrabarty have engaged themselves in positioning women in the
scheme of the nationalist movement. The starting point of the argument is why the
"Women's/Women question' lapses into the relatively unimportant issue for nationalist discourse by
the end of the 19th century. Chatterjee answers this traditional question as follows: the reason,
Chatterjee says, lies in nationalism's success in situating the "women's question" in an inner domain
of sovereignty, far removed from the area of political contest with 
(<b>++Page 17</b>) the colonial state. His argument
is based on the well-known dichotomy of spiritual/material, feminine/masculine, and home/world.
Middle class women were regarded as the embodiment of spiritual values which were the essence
of the Indian nation. Their homes were regarded as sanctuaries to be protected by any means from
vicious influences of the material outside world. Thus the 's question ceased to be an issue women
I to be discussed in public. However, Chatterjee seems to be fully conscious of this. In his view,
women were bound "to a new, and yet entirely legitimate, subordination "under the new patriarchy
advocated by nationalism".<p>

      Nationalist ideology on women worked on the principle of exclusion, demarcating sharply
between "new" women and common women who lived in the subaltern domain. Chatterjee also
noticed this limitation. Referring to the biographical details of a few women, he examined how
women who did not belong to the middle class were excluded from the nationalist value system.
The purpose of his study lies in an attempt to find a way for overcoming the subjugated condition
of common/subaltern women.<p>
 
     Dipesh Chakrabarty's article on the management of the <b><i>bhadralok</i></b>'s domestic life invited
some criticism. As subalterns were excluded from the purview of his narrative, this article was
jeered at as typical piece of <b><i>bhadralok</i></b> studies. Its post-modernistic title, "The Difference-Diferral
of a Colonial Modernity: Public Debates on Domesticity in British India" appears to be not a small
cause for the criticism attracted by this article. However, what he writes, though certainly not how
he writes, is easily understandable. In the modern <b><i>bhadralok</i></b> home, Victorian values such as
discipline, obedience, dilligence, hygiene, education were intentionally introduced. Many books on
domestic science were written in Bengali by authors, both male and female. These values served to
link the domestic with the idea of the national in Bengal. as it did in England. On the other hand,
the home was sanctified and protected from the colonial state with the utmost care even as it was
exposed to modern British values by the same nationalist intellectuals.<p>

      Lastly, in <b><i>SS</i></b> IX, Kamala Visweswaran, analyses the moments self- assertion of middle
class women. She is critical of Chatterjee's argument. Her contention is that in Chatterjee's
discourse women's agencies are subject to a kind of silencing. Women are considered to be
subaltern within the patriarchal frame of society. But they should be distinguished from subaltern
women. Analyses of women's behaviour in jail reveal the distinction between women as subaltern
and subaltern women as the jail became the sites for the struggle over the definition of classes and
caste. Middle class women prisoners did their best to get treatment conformable to their social
status. Naturally, lower-class women were deprived of jail privileges which middle class women
received: "In this way, elite nationalists and colonial administrators shared similar attitudes towards
lower class, poor women." Her other contention is that, contrary to what Spivak says, subaltern
women can speak, though their voices are inevitably small. <p>
