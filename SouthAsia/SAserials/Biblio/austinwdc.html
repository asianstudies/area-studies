<font size="+3" valign=bottom><b>T</b></font>he 50th birthday of the
Indian Constitution was symbolically marked in many ways, of which two
are notable: the one a ceremonial official celebration, the other a
quieter reflection in a scholarly mode.  The first was the special
joints session of Parliament, at which the Prime Minister announced
that a commission would be established to review the Constitution.
The second was the appearance of a book reviewing India's experience
of working that Constitution from 1950 to 1985.  If there is a
singular lesson to be gleaned from Granville Austin's meticulously
researched and detailed biography of our Constitution, it is that this
has never been anything but an intensely contested document. For the
past fifty years, it has been pulled this way and that, tossed about 
in the rough and tumble of parliament-judiciary rugby, and frequently
stretched beyond recognition to fit the demands of whichever political
shibboleths happened to be currently fashionable. Indeed, so
dramatically has political practice deviated from its principles that
the gentlemen (and token lady) currently contemplating its fate may
only be taking the restless career of this ill-served and rather
scarred document to its logical conclusion.</td>

Just as his first book remains an indispensable guide
to the deliberations of the Constituent Assembly, this
volume too will endure as an encyclopaedic work of
reference. The timing of its release confers on it an
additional value, as a reminder that the flimsy, and
even fatuous, reasons being offered today to review
the Constitution have been offered before, and are
potentially dangerous. No more today than yesterday
is the Constitution inhibiting the achievement of
either stability or socio-economic progress, however
these are defined</font></center>

<p>

It would be only too easy to sensationalise some of the evidence 
that Granville Austin offers, to present it in a then and now' pastiche,
where the past and the present appear as grotesque mirror-images of
each other. For instance, the indecent haste recently displayed by the
BJP in the matter of constitutional review recalls Nehru's words to
the chief ministers in 1951, that "if the Constitution itself comes in
our way, then surely it is time to change that Constitution".
Similarly, a quicker pace of socioeconomic progress was one of the two
reasons offered by Prime Minister Vajpayee for the review. Austin
shows us the Congress Working Committee arguing, in 1954, that "it
will not be proper to slow down the pace of social and economic
progress ...simply because certain provisions in the Constitution tend
to hamper such progress." Some years later, Indira Gandhi claimed that
Fundamental Rights (especially the right to property) obstructed
social and economic change, and it was none other than Atal Behari
Vajpayee who led a walkout by his party from the Lok Sabha, protesting
that an irresponsible Congress majority in Parliament may sweep away
the very basis of the Constitution! The attitude towards the
Constitution that finds expression in all these statements is
disturbingly instrumentalist.<p>

Nevertheless, we cannot lose sight of the very different ideological
projects that animated the desire for constitutional change then and
now, or of the fact that even governments with substantial majorities
attempted to bring in changes through amendments, rather than through
a lock, stock and barrel review. Not every reader of Austin's book may
interpret it in this way, but this reviewer was left with the
disconcerting impression that the Constitution of India has never been
taken seriously enough as the basic framework of the polity in the
Rawlsian sense. This involves the elaboration of the principles of
justice that inform the social and political organisation of society,
which all its members publicly accept as the fairest principles that
should govern their social and political relationships. All manner of
political regimes have perceived the Constitution as an inconvenience,
and even political leaders of great stature have made no secret of
their impatience with it or their willingness to change it. It has but
rarely been accorded the sacrosanct character of a document that
reflects the distilled wisdom and political consensus of the struggle
for national independence. It has not even enjoyed the advantage of an
undisturbed running-in period. Was this because the Constituent
Assembly was not as representative a body as it should have been? Or
was it because conflicts between the framers of the Constitution
resulted in some forced compromises that, in the long run, wore thin
and rendered the political fabric fragile?<p>

The evolution of this document was in fact the subject of Granville
Austin's first book <i>The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a
Nation</i> (first published by Oxford University Press, Delhi in 1966,
and reissued last year). In that work, Austin had conceptualised
India's constitutional edifice in terms of "a seamless web", composed
of three intertwined strands which were intended to be strengthened
together: social revolution, democracy, and unity and integrity. In
his new book, Austin approaches the working of the Constitution
chiefly through the lens of conflicts between parliament and the
judiciary, and attempts to show how the three strands of the seamless
web have worked out in 35 years of political practice. On the whole,
he is inclined to the view that the seamless web remains an
appropriate metaphor, though he does, at the end of the volume, add a
fourth strand: namely, culture.<p>

The book is divided into six parts, of which the first five are
chronologically arranged, each with an opening chapter that provides
the political context of the legal and judicial controversies detailed
in the rest.  Given the enormity of the task he set out to accomplish,
it may seem churlish to complain, but the author's dependence on
purely political history sometimes results in an account which is
worryingly innocent of political economy and the societal
underpinnings of politics. <p>

In his examination of the working of the Constitution in the first
phase (1950-66), Austin identifies the main challenges to (a) the
social revolutionary strand through the cases relating to the right to
property, and the first, fourth and seventeenth amendments; (b) the
democracy strand through the issues of freedom of expression,
individual liberty and preventive detention; and (c) the unity strand
through the use of Emergency provisions in the states, as well as the
sub-constitutional institutions set up to `make' the nation. This was
also the phase in which conflicts between parliament and the judiciary
first surfaced, with the First Amendment establishing the precedent of
amending the Constitution whenever the judiciary sought to put a spoke
in the wheel of government programmes and policies. Austin alerts us
to the significance --  even in this phase of relative innocence -- of
the creation, by this amendment, of the Ninth Schedule, which would
later be diabolically misused by Nehru's unscrupulous daughter.<p>

The class tensions which were manifest in the first Nehruvian phase of
constitutional government were carried over into the second (1967-73)
phase, the early `socialist' period of Indira Gandhi's prime
ministership, symbolised in the policies of bank nationalisation and
the abolition of privy purses. This was also the period of the most
intense warring over particular constitutional provisions, with both
parliament and the judiciary claiming supremacy in the interpretation
of the Constitution. These were obviously not unrelated issues. The
Supreme Court's 6-5 decision in the Golak Nath case, that fundamental
rights could not be abrogated by Parliament even through
constitutional amendment, as also the subsequent judgements on the
bank nationalisation and privy purses cases, made manifest the latent
tension between the government's social revolutionary aims and the
court's status quo-ist interpretation of the constitutional right to
property.<p>

With the renewed confidence that came from a favourable electoral
verdict in the 1971 elections, Indira Gandhi set about counteracting
the effects of these judgements, through the Twenty-Fourth and
Twenty-Fifth amendments, which entrenched the principle of
parliamentary supremacy vis-à-vis the judiciary and of the executive
vis-à-vis the presidency. However, in the Kesavananda Bharati case
(1973), the Supreme Court laid down the principle of the `basic
structure' of the Constitution which Parliament, being a creature of
the Constitution, did not have the power<p>

<b>[++Page 10]</b><p>

to amend (this idea, Austin tells us, was first proposed by the
advocates of Golak Nath in their arguments before the bench). Though
he provides a detailed description of the legal provisions that became
the subject of disputes between the social revolutionary (government)
and conservative (judiciary) tendencies, and apparently recognises the
social tensions that these represented, Austin emphasises equally the
underconfident Indira's search for, as he calls it, "job security".
So, if it is an explanation of these events that you are looking for,
don't expect to find it on Austin's elaborately laid out table: just
take your pick of toppings and make your own pizza.<p>

The somewhat excessive reliance on interviews with Delhi's
bureaucratic and political elite, and faith in the integrity of every
individual interviewed, leaves its imprint on Austin's account of the
Emergency. Though his position is robustly democratic for the most
part, he actually sees some merit in the view that the country was
lapsing into chaos. "The government's action was not", he argues
"utterly without justification". Nevertheless, Austin documents ably
the centralisation of power that was taking place, as also the
<i>dramatis personae</i> of this script. He recognises also the
spuriousness of the claim that it was to advance the social
revolutionary programme that unity had to be enforced and democracy
banished from the Republic. He remains, however, ambivalent: "There
existed, separate from the power-hungry intentions of the Prime
Minister and her clique, genuine ideological sentiment to reform the
Constitution." Even PN. Dhar's account (in his recently published
<i>Indira Gandhi, the 'Emergency' and Indian Democracy</i>, Oxford
University Press, Delhi, 2000) is, despite being an insider's story,
more broad-based.<p>

It would, nevertheless, be hard to find a more detailed and
comprehensive account of the events that ultimately led to the
infamous Forty-Second Amendment, which sought to undo the damage
caused by the Kesavananda judgement, by conferring virtually unlimited
power on Parliament. The establishment and functioning of the Swaran
Singh Committee, and the debates in several forums, on the question of
constitutional reform, are carefully documented. Having already
`packed' the Court by ignoring norms of seniority, and punished those
who were seen to be recalcitrant, Indira Gandhi sought to use the
Forty-Second Amendment to bar judicial review of constitutional
amendments.<p>

The restoration of democracy in 1977 entailed the restoration of
Fundamental Rights and civil liberties, as well as guarantees of
judicial independence. The Supreme Court's judgement in the Minerva
Mills case (1980) ruled that judicial review was inseparable from the
basic unamendable structure of the constitution. Meanwhile, Indira
Gandhi's return to power was marked by challenges to the unity strand,
as regional assertions and separatist politics demanded administrative
attention. Never again would the social revolutionary strand be
preeminent in national debate the way it was in the years before the
Emergency. The Emergency not merely undermined democracy, the rhetoric
of social revolution too was now revealed to be no more than hollow
populism.<p>

Granville Austin has told his tale well, privileging two dimensions of
the story: one, the struggle for preeminence between the judiciary and
the government-in-parliament; and two, the tension between the
Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles of State Policy. In
both cases, the legacy of the 1970s presents non-eradicable scars.
Judicial independence was indeed formally restored, but any
contemporary reader would be forgiven for chuckling over the evidence
offered by Justice Reddy for his allegation that ministers were
influencing judges: a lunch that Minister S.S. Ray and his wife had
with Justice and Mrs. Mukherjea! Similarly, as the commitment to the
Directive Principles was cynically translated into populist rhetoric,
the Indian citizen today is assured neither of respect for her
Fundamental Rights, nor of her entitlement to state-provided
welfare.<p>

What, then, does the introduction of the fourth strand achieve? India,
says Austin, is a "survival society", in which both the rich and the
poor working hard to increase their pile and protect what they have.
The working of the Constitution, he argues, has been profoundly
impacted by culture, especially in terms of inherited structures of
caste and ideologies that justify hierarchy and inequality, and which
encourage casteism and communal politics. At the end, everything from
the failure of public policy such as that on land reform, to the
"empty promise" syndrome (the gap between promise and performance), is
blamed on culture. But surely, even populist politics, let alone
public policies on poverty, deserve a fuller explanation than this,
and are related as much to political economy as to culture?<p>

In seeking to document the history of a Constitution at work,
Granville Austin attempted a truly ambitious task and has, within the
parameters he set himself, pulled it off admirably. Just as his first
book remains an indispensable guide to the deliberations of the
Constituent Assembly, this volume too will endure as an encyclopaedic
work of reference. The timing of its release confers on it an
additional value, as a reminder that the flimsy, and even fatuous,
reasons being offered today to review the Constitution have been
(with, of course, different ideological purposes) offered before, and
are potentially dangerous. No more today than yesterday is the
Constitution inhibiting the achievement of either stability or
socioeconomic progress, however these are defined. It is surely
unrealistic to expect political stability in a polity undergoing a
dramatic social upheaval. Moreover, it is apparent that the economic
reforms process inaugurated by the Congress Party in 1991, and being
enthusiastically advanced by the once-swadeshi BJP today, represents a
radical departure from the welfare socialism implicit in the
Constitution. As such, it is hard to see how the Constitution has
fettered economic `progress', as it is defined in the lexicon of these
political parties.<p>

Ultimately, as both common sense and Austin's book tell us, the fault
lies not in our Constitution, but in ourselves. This tired cliché has
been repeated countless times since January 26, 2000, but there is in
it a precious kernel of truth. Institutional design is a complex
business, rendered even more complicated by our inability to figure
out the relationship between institutions and those who work them, as
well as the human relationships for which they provide the framework.
While we readily recognise the normative underpinnings of policy -- as
distinct from the practical aspects of policy implementation -- we are
less willing to accept that a constitution is, on a larger, more
encompassing scale, the same sort of exercise, one that simply spells
out most generally the broad normative principles by which a polity
will be guided. This is why constitutionalism is not something that is
practised exclusively by state personnel and the political class, but
also by citizens, as a habit of the heart. The recognition of the
failures of the last 50 years calls for a more solemn commitment to
the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution. Undermining it
in ways that we are currently witnessing will simply damage the
already delicate political fabric of our society further. We can only
hope that this effort at change will also go the way of many of its
precursors -- into oblivion.<p>
