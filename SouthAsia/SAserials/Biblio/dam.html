<p>A river in India is a celebration.  It is a festival of religion, myth, science, work, music, ecology.  
To say it is life banalizes both words.  A river is like an external unconscious flowing with all the
memories, the detritus, the flotsam and jetsam of a civilization.  Whether it is the Ganga, or even a
coffee table book on it, whether the Indus, Brahmaputra or Cauvery, a river is a symphony of
resonances.  But when one hyphenates a river to a 
nation and talks of <i>Taming the Waters</i> or <i>The
Dam and the Nation</i>, something dies.. It is as if death and disciplining go together. A river
becomes less of a river. It becomes cusecs of water and calories of energy. It is an act of
reductionism, where each word destroy or desiccates.

<p>Martin Heidegger put this idea brilliantly. He was talking about his river, the Rhine. He said,
"Consider the difference between an old bridge built over the Rhine and a modern power plant
that uses the Rhine as a source of energy The bridge which is built into the river, lets the Rhine be
itself and brings forward its essential character by bridging its separate banks. The hydroelectric
plant, however, builds the Rhine into the plant itself so that the river becomes merely part of the
machinery needed to generate electricity, The riverly character of the river is denied as it becomes
merely a resource used to turn the generators. The mechanical force of the river is transformed
into electrical force and the river b"cones technologically identified with electrical power."

<p>Today the Narmada is becoming energy or electric power. The river is becoming a prop of lazy
machine that needs to be re-worked. It is not just the tribals, who need to be rehabilitated, it is the
river itself As river, it is untamed excess. It is force, it is unbounded. It needs to be disciplined.
Implicit in all this is not just an industrializing of the river but a taming of sexuality, of nature as
excess. When the discourse of dam-building is added to the discourse on Nation-building,
something odd happens. Dam-building, nation-building, character-building all become engineering
activities. Thu classic exposition of this was in the life of Visvesaraya, the great engineer, aptly
called-the father of Indian planning.

<p>What happens within the structure of such a discourse is that certain kinds of dissent become
questionable. To question the dam is regarded as being anti-national. Criticizing large dams is
unscientific. 'Good' dissent can only add epicycles to the reigning paradigm, the Comte-ist
nation-state which believes dams are the temples of modern India. Within such a discourse, you
can only talk of rehabilitation. It is a Henry Ford version of democracy which says "you can have
any color you like as long as it is black." But there are possibilities even within this world of black
brightening to grey or dull white.

<p>The struggle against the Narmada dam has created an endless circle of debates. In that sense every
protest movement is an act of rewriting history.  But sometimes the history thus written become
addendums on hydropolitics and tightens the nooses of discourse around the victims. It pits the
ecological movements against the Indian state without realizing the particular amnesia this
demands. Ironically the planned Indian state began as a discourse of ecology. Planning was an
ecocratic discourse. The Indian state was an activity that sought welfare through ecolacy,
controlling rivers, building dams, inaugurating irrigation programmes. But what began as a pursuit
of welfare became an act of warfare where dams created more refugees than war. In questioning
this discourse, three frames have to be simultaneously broken or modified-the scientific discourse,
the democratic frame and the nation-state. Or at the least we must engage in the Chinese debate
of Mr. Science versus Mr. Democracy. Patriarchal but still welcome. But what is missing in these
two competent books is precisely this sense of ancestry and cognitive justice. The Narmada dam
is amalgamated into a Western discourse of hydropolitics with no sense of the debates on energy,
science and the dam of the <i>Science and Culture</i> group. A local genealogy is wiped out in a Ph.D
tribute to IDS, Sussex. Secondly, the domain of the expert unquestioningly straddles both worlds.
The expert as scientist dominates the world of science and democracy. Traditional practice is still
ethnoscience. It still needs prefixes and suffixes to survive. Secondly, the idea of cognitive justice
is missing, the sense that tribal worlds too have their forms of valid knowledge and well-being.
The question one is asking is not against Cost-Benefit. The question is why leave the expert, as NGO,
World Bank, or Hydrologist untouched? How does one solve a controversy which is both
scientific and political? Is the victim only a document, a voice, or also a theorist? If so, can his
notions of well-being be woven into the economists' model? Bela Bhatia's (Dreze, et al.) essay
comes close to this view of the world.

<p>Yet it is not a problem of method atone. It is not only the conversation between observer and
observed, of committed participant observation which Bela Bhatia and Amita Baviskar and even
Bradford Morse accomplish. It is a deeper sense of embeddedness, of involvement. A few years
ago, in a debate with some World Bank experts at University of California, Berkeley, some
activists made the following propositions to World Bank officials playing Mother Teresa. It is also
relevant to our Indian experts who love to join the World Bank.

<ul>

"i) Could you instal a wailing wall in the World Bank office? So victims and even project staff can
weep and mourn for the disasters they have created. Grief, guilt, suffering, mourning, these are
words that must enter the World Bank vocabulary and social science. There is a gap between
Morse and remorse.

<p>ii) Could World Bank and the Indian government provide insurance to all projects that go
haywire?

<p>iii) Or if one is tempted to see the World Bank as a moral or legal entity, can one hold a
Nuremberg trial on aft development projects?

<p>iv) Can project staff living in Third World areas live at the same standard as the people there?

<p>v) Could we attach a human rights team to all development projects? Maybe even an
Ombudsman?

<p>vi) Development projects whether as dams, roads, or forest bills -- are or have to be democratic
acts. So can one have an institutionalized process of referendum and recall for these projects?
Mere transparency is inadequate."</ul>

The reason I am asking all these perverse questions of two such well-crafted books is simple.
Environmentalism is today a boy -scout world. Dissent gets easily coopted, without its
suggestions being institutionalized. We produced Ph.D's long after Chipko is desiccated and the
dams we fought survive as obscene monstrosities. Is such social science of rehabilitation adequate
or do we need in our 50th year of Independence a civil disobedience, a <i>satyagraha </i>against a
nation-state committed to Big science and Development as ecocidal acts?
