<p>Critics and friends of Arvind N. Das sunk their often
irreconcilable differences to pay tribute to him when his life was cut short in
its prime on August 6. This was a rare occurrence in India considering the
bitter divisiveness that permeates its rapidly shrinking space for intellectual
pursuits. From Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, who stood at the
opposite end of his political beliefs, to his comrades in the CPI(ML), Arvind
received fulsome praise for his achievements as a social scientist, journalist,
activist, documentary film-maker and Editor of
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Biblio/bib.html"
target="_blank"><i>Biblio</i></a>.

<p>While he was still around, Arvind's critics, like his friends, would
say much the same thing about him, though for entirely different reasons:
"He refuses to grow up." Arvind's folly, in the eyes of the critics, was that
late into his adult years, he continued to believe in causes he had embraced
as an exceptionally gifted student at St. Stephen's College in Delhi: class
struggle, the emancipation of the peasantry from feudal oppression, rights of
workers, the awakening of the Dalits and so forth. In an India where the
buzz words are economic reforms, globalisation and market forces, Arvind's
advocacy of the wretched of the earth sounded odd to his critics: dogmatic,
extremist, rhetorical, impractical or out of sync with the 'real' world

<p>For his friends, however, Arvind's "refusal to grow up" was
precisely what was so endearing about his personality. Not for him the
double-speak of the politician, the smooth phrases of the diplomat, the
opinionated babble of the scribe or the pedestrian outpourings of the
academic. He said whatever he had to say clearly, forcefully and eloquently,
taking care to lend a wider perspective to each issue, a historical
perspective, or a perspective of political economy

<p>Indeed, he was so deeply attached to a vibrant debate that he
would sometimes willfully exaggerate a point, introduce a note of
vehemence in his tone or throw in a dash of irony or sarcasm just to keep
the argument going. He thrived on dissent and prospered on polemics. His
favourite question was: "Forget the facts for the moment. What is the
theory?" And once he had stumped his interlocutor, he would proceed to
advance an hypothesis with a conspiratorial hint that he was privy to some
information not available to others which would prove him right

<p>More to the point, Arvind's way of engaging in a debate was to
challenge conventional wisdom, shift the dominant paradigm or alter the
perspective in vouge from ed to end.  Though he was firmly

<p>located on the extreme fringe of the Left, he refused to be
trapped in any ideological straightjacket. He appeared to cultivate his own
anarchic streak--but to call him an anarchist wouldn't be quite fair. Indeed,
what held Arvind in thrall were scholars, politicians, artists, businessmen
and others who chose to swim against the tide

<p>Those who knew him well were aware of the intense curiosity
with which he followed the words and actions of VP Singh--Arvind was an
early adherent of Mandalism but later grew disillusioned with its
implementation--or of another former Prime Minister, Chandrashekhar. He
had harsh comments to make on Laloo Prasad Yadav but he defended the
Bihari leader tooth and nail if someone else dared to criticize him. He had
much the same attitude to Jyoti Basu. For long years he had been
contemptuous of the established Left parties but Bengal's Chief Minister
could do little wrong in his eyes. Nothing had got him more excited than the
prospect of Basu heading the government at the Centre

<p>For certain individuals Arvind swore absolute loyalty. They
included, in the first place, the Marxist historian, D.D. Kosambi. The
writings of Kosambi were the prime source of his inspiration for the
monumental 18-part documentary on the evolution of Indian civilization that
he wrote, produced and directed for Doordarshan. He also drew on the
works of Romila Thapar, Irfan Habib and Barun De. Amartya Sen was yet
another favourite. At one time during his student years, Arvind was the only
student of the future Nobel Prize winner

<p>But Arvind's real obsession--the one that shaped his thinking,
guided his written output and nourished his conversations--was his native
Bihar. It can be said without exaggeration that no contemporary Indian
thinker has spoken and written about the glorious past, the dismal present
and potential for a great future of this state with such lofty eloquence as he
did. In his eyes, Bihar was a metaphor for India itself. At a pinch, he would
have deemed it to be the very centre of the universe. While he loathed its
venal, caste-ridden, ineffective governance, the violent nature of its society,
its decrepit intellectual and cultural life and the slothful ways of its elite, he
never missed an opportunity to recall its rich cultural and spiritual legacy,
the noble character of its long suffering people and the revolutionary
potential of its youth. Two of his books-- <i>The Republic of Bihar</i> and
<i>Cbangel: The Biography of a Village-</i>-bear vivid testimony to what the
state meant to him

<p>All this explains why Arvind, who had acquired an enviable
reputation as an academic and a journalism both at home and abroad, was
never part of

<p>the Capital's party circuit. He would have been completely out
of place in this world noted for its philistine ways, its undercurrent of sleaze
and its moral coarseness. He preferred to socialise with like-minded
individuals, those who still valued books, nursed a social conscience,
focussed on forces that shaped the lives of individuals, communities and
nations and delighted in the arts of India

<p>Endowed with a free and open mind and a generous heart,
Arvind answered every call for support and comfort, rushed to participate in
every scheme which demanded a breath of imagination and, above all, stood
by his hugely talented family and his friends. Even those of his friends who
had abandoned the radicalism of the Left to seek fortune or fame in other
ideological havens-or in the enclave of expediency-found him to be
singularly lacking in rancour or recrimination

<p>In his last book <i>Down and Out: Labouring under Global
Capitalism</i>, which he coauthored with Jan Bremen, the distinguished Dutch
scholar, Arvind presented a bleak picture of the fate of the labourer in
present times. Its central thesis is that globalisation and privatisation have
pushed millions of workers to languish in squalor, poverty and misery and
that no redemption is in sight for the near future. This is how the book ends:

<blockquote>"It is a gloomy scenario, one of exclusion of a large section of
the people from the fruits of productivity to which they contribute. And yet,
not only work but life itself must go on and dignity and hope, protest and
resistance, honour and optimism must be asserted even in these dismal
conditions. The forms of such assertion may not be dramatic; they may not
be based on collective solidarity; they may have a mundane everyday
quality; their locus may be the habitat, the home, the locality; the resisters
and the protesters may relate to each other as neighbours rather than as co-
workers--nevertheless, protest and resistance go on and mobilisation and
organisation are carried out in different ways. As Galileo said in another
context, And yet it moves."' </blockquote>

<p>It is Arvind N. Das's ebullient personality, his fine intellect, his
inspired indignation against all forms of sham, prejudice and oppression and,
equally, his sensitivity to anything that brought cheer and grace and dignity
to individuals that his friends and colleagues, especially here at
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAserials/Biblio/bib.html"
target="_blank"><i>Biblio</i></a>, will
miss for a long, long time

<p><center><font size="+1"><b>The last of the intellectuals</b></font>
by Chandan Mitra</center>

<p>He was the last of the intellectuals in the classic sense of that
much-maligned term, except for one attribute: There was a remarkable
absence of arrogance in his demeanour. Dr. Arvind Narayan Das shot into
fame only in the late1980s after he joined
<a href="http://www.timesofindia.com/" target="_blank">
<i>The Times of India</i></a> as Senior
Editor, but he always had a huge fan following among students throughout
North India and was adored in academic circles, especially among scholars
of history and sociology. The only explanation for his most untimely death
(he was merely 51) is to be found in that old adage that God calls back early
those He dearly loves. This was no time to die, Arvind. God was very selfish
in your case. Unlike most of his comrades, Arvind never personalised his
ideological disagreements. He did not go around bad-mouthing people just
because they were not in agreement with his point of view. Instead, he
always tried to help, wherever he could. That probably explains why he had
so many admirers cutting across ideology, age, region, religion and nation

<p>Again unlike most Marxist academics, Arvind never suffered
from insecurity. Actually, he towered over his compatriots in both the depth
and finesse of his intellect; he did not have to worry about being upstaged
by anybody. Arvind and I grew apart over the years on the ideological front.
When he joined <a href="http://www.timesofindia.com/" target="_blank">
<i>TOI</i></a>, I was still Left-leaning although my disillusionment
with the organised communist movement was growing rapidly. Arvind was
never part of organised communism. There was an anarchist element in him
that, understandably, drew him

towards what is loosely described in India as Naxalism

<p>In his student days he was an official revolutionary, swayed by
the fires of Maoism that swept academia in large parts of India. Incredible as
this might sound in today's apolitical epoch, Arvind contested and won the
presidentship of the students' union society of St. Stephen's College,
campaigning on an overt Naxalite platform. He had a capacity to mesmerise
and, shortly after becoming students' union chief, succeeded in luring quite a
few talented students away from studies into the backwaters of his native
Bihar to practise revolution. Needless to add, like all such amateur efforts,
the move to establish a revolutionary "foco" on the Cuban model in Arvind's
home village, failed miserably. Most of his Stephanian compatriots returned
to the mainstream in sackcloth and ashes. Some gave up politics altogether
and ran into the outstretched arms of Ford Foundation or similar American-
funded bodies which they had volubly denounced till just the other day.
Some others like Ravindra (Lallu) Ray and Dilip Simeon continued to
doggedly pursue the idealistic if impractical goal of an egalitarian society.
Arvind, again unlike many of his turncoat ex-comrades, never pooh-poohed
them; nor was he ever patronising about their continued commitment to a
failed cause. If anything, he always supported such efforts morally and
materially

<p>Having abandoned the praxis of revolution, Arvind turned to
academics. He obtained a doctorate in history from Calcutta University and
thereafter flitted between research institutes, both at home and abroad,

spending long years at Surat. He was the blue-eyed boy of
several leading historians and sociologists. I wonder why he never went into
full-time teaching. He would have been as celebrated a teacher as the late
Professor Sushobhan Sarkar, his son Sumit, Professor Randhir Singh or
Professor Gyanendra Pandey. Arvind was gifted with a remarkable felicity
of the tongue and agility of mind. These qualities enabled him to emerge
rapidly as a consummate seminarist and influential columnist within a few
years of his transformation into a journalist. For an academic, Arvind was
remarkably lucid. His turns of phrase and pithy observations immediately
enabled him to garner a large and loyal readership. Sometimes, I felt, Arvind
indulged in a bit of smart writing and polemics which subdued the
seriousness of his argument. But his readers seemed to enjoy that immensely

<a name="invented"></a>
<img src="im/arvindi.jpg" align=left alt="Arvind N. Das during the shooting of 'India Invented'">
<p>His foray into television, I always thought, was a mistake. But
demonstrating rare camaraderie, he joined Dileep Padgaonkar and his
long-time comrade, Anikendra Nath (Badshah) Sen in APCA. But the
intellectually restless man he was, Arvind utilised his years at APCA to
produce, direct and present a phenomenal 18-part television documentary,
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/SAvideos/indiainvented.html" target="_blank">
<i>India Invented</i></a>, based on the writings of his intellectual guru, the doyen of
Marxist historians, Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi. I used to be a regular
guest on various APCA programmes, and Arvind would urge me to watch
one episode each time I visited the APCA studios. Sadly, the serial received
scant publicity. I hope Arvind's friends (and I count myself among them)
will get

together to give it a treatment better than that which it received
in his lifetime

<p>One of the least parochial Biharis I have come across, Arvind
was, however, deeply committed to his native State. Apart from writing the
well-known treatise, <i>The Republic of Bihar</i>, some years ago, Arvind
contributed significantly to the State's intellectual life through his association
with Patna's A. N. Sinha Institute. He had a large following in Bihar, but
that did not make him a Bihar lobbyist. His liberal education and exposure
across the country and abroad, especially his annual lectures in Holland,
ensured that he suffered few prejudices. His mindset was so broad that it
overcame the sectarianism normally associated with Marxists, particularly
those of the proto-Naxalite variety

<p>But above all, as I said at the outset, Arvind was an intellectual.
His mind never stopped probing. He did not confine his interests to just a
few narrow spheres. I recall when I wrote one of my first sociological pieces
on Hindi cinema in <a href="http://www.timesofindia.com/" target="_blank">
<i>The Times of India</i></a>, Arvind was the only senior
journalist to compliment me. In fact, he took the matter up with Girilal Jain,
arguing that my piece, explaining the success of <i>Mr India</i>, ought to have
appeared on the editorial page rather than in <i>Saturday Times</i>, a supplement
Girilalji hated. Himself a purveyor of social trends, Arvind brought his
formidable reading and analytical prowess to examine evolving
socio-political trends. Because he was not a dogmatist, he could
communicate his ideas even to people who disagreed with his ideological
matrix. That is what I call an intellectual. One doesn't have to sport a <i>jhola</i>,
don an unkempt appearance, indulge in rank sectarianism and intensely
dissect only subjects of one's own specialisation, to be conferred the
honorific. An intellectual must have an ability to communicate his
intelligence, engage others in dialogue through his intellect. Arvind was, in
that sense, the last of this species, at least among my contemporaries

<p>Adieu, Arvind. We will really miss you. You were an agnostic
and so you will dismiss this suggestion. But I will make it nevertheless. Up
there, engage that Great Spirit who controls our destinies in debate and
convince him that there is too much wrong that still goes on in this world to
which He is blind. Given your ability for persuasive argument, He might just
listen and do something that you always wanted to do in this world

<center><font size="+1"><b>Chronicler of Bihar</b></font>
by Rukmini Bhaya Nair</center>

<p>Presents endear absents, wrote Charles Lamb. The poignant
truth of these words now hits me in the solar plexus as I look at the two
small but invaluable presents that Arvind Das gave me last year. They
consist, simply, of a rough road map and a book. As a sociologist, Arvind
was well aware of the rich literature around the magical rituals of the gift. A
gift transforms its recipient by revealing to her, for a luminous moment, the
'soul' of the donor. Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to speak like this for I
did not know Arvind at all well, but I do know in my bones that these
objects he helped me with--book and map--show something immortal,
despite my being a crabby and confirmed atheist

<p>Last year, I sought Arvind's assistance on a subject where his
expertise was something of

a legend--Bihar. And Arvind responded with his characteristic
generosity and an infectious enthusiasm. It turned out that my father and
Arvind, who knew each other well, shared common memories--memories of
living in Bihar and, more particularly, of inheriting stories about the great
earthquake of 1984. This was a disaster in which several members of my
family died--grandfather, aunt, great-cousins--and I wanted to find out more
about the town in which they had lived, not so far from the epicentre of the
quake--Muzaffarpur. Arvind himself did not lose family in the earthquake
but his grandfather's house in nearby Changel village came tumbling down.
When his grandfather rebuilt his battered home, Arvind told me, he insisted
on enormous walls two-and-a-half-feet thick--<i>walls which

could withstand death</i>. Death, indeed, was a constant theme in
our otherwise very animated conversations over the past year; and it's
against the great backdrop of historical mortality that Arvind's roadmap
(inset) makes acute sense. As is apparent, the map was casually drawn with
Arvind's free right hand, while the other held aloft an insouciant whisky!
What its bare lines lay out, however, is not just the shape of Muzaffarpur
town in North Bihar but its bustling, unput-downable spirit. Muzaffarpur
(population 150, 000 approx.) is dismissed with a terse note by the global
<i>Lonely Planet </i>guide: "Apart from being a bus and train changing point on
the way to the Nepal border, Muzaffarpur is of no real interest. This is a
poverty ridden and agriculturally backward area." But Arvind saw the place
with different eyes. This was no mere changing station. It was a destination
in itself, rich with history. Before my astonished gaze, Arvind made the NH
28 roar with fumes and industrial

energy with a few brisk strokes of a hastily produced ball-point.
He brought to life an epoch of turmoil as the terrain of Muzaffarpur was
divided between the British Collectorate and Commissionary and its
opposite 'native quarter' in the Saraiya ganj and Moti Jheel areas. He took
me through the manifold transformation of the college-life and education
over a century as L.S. College turned into Bihar University which then
morphed into B.R. Ambedkar University. In Arvind's hands,
Muzaffarpur--Bihar itself--seethed with life, with change, and not just, as the
'India Survival Kit' would have it, for back-packers en route to Nepal!

<p>
<img src="im/arvinds.gif" align=left alt="thing at an intersection">
When I look at the map Arvind drew, I realise that he created
endless narrative possibilities in its interstices. That is why it casts a spell,
and also why I think I instinctively preserved it without quite knowing why.
Indeed, I see Arvind himself ironically commemorated by the Muzaffarpur
monument, so sniffily labelled "thing at an intersection" (inset) by the <i>Lonely
Planet</i>. For, as he put it to me once with an unabashed twinkle in his eye, it
is 'monstrous' structures like 'the thing', as much as the great Buddhist
stupa at Gaya, which

represent the entire raucous, irrepressible, eternal
weltanschauung of 'the Republic of Bihar'!

<p>Bihar--another name for survival down the generations. Arvind's
grandfather, skilled at survival, the one who built his house as a bastion
against death, is also, in a way, the hero of his second gift to me. The book
entitled <i>Changel: the Biography of a Village</i> by Arvind. N. Das describes
how he tackled "the fourth dimension of time" on his return, as a
sophisticated St. Stephen's graduate, to his ancestral village after a lapse of
years. "My dear Bachcha" his grandfather had written to him, "your
grandmother passed away yesterday... Come to Changel if you can. Yours
affectionately, Baba." And of course Arvind, or Bachcha, went, back to his
roots, back to Changel...I suppose it is inevitable that, when we embark on
what Arvind presciently calls "an ongoing journey through space and time",
we all encounter our Changels sooner or later--our still centres of return.
The

difference between most of us and Arvind lies only in the
startling clarity with which he perceived this truth, despite the hectic whirl
of his life. In the last sentence of his book, for example, he announces
without equivocation: "I belong to Changel" while the fly-leaf of my copy
carries the following prophetic inscription: <i>To Rukmini, a survivor of Mzp
(as the <a href="#ref">Rlys. say</a>) from another.</i><a href="#ref">* </a> Arvind, it appears, knew that he would
survive. Apart from the presents he gave me, and others, this was, I think,
his own unique gift-the zestful certainty that he would surmount every
mishap, including death. It is a quality that makes him-like Bihar-ultimately
invulnerable and totally indestructible

<p>Dear Colleagues:

<p>I am sorry to report that our friend and colleague, Arvind
Narayan Das died of cardiac arrest yesterday, August 6, in Amsterdam.

<p>He was frequently in Europe and the UK, primarily at the University
of Amsterdam and its Centre for Asian Studies. Among his occasional
visits to the United States was that in May 1997 when he participated in
the symposium on <a
href="http://www.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/zindabad.html">
Power, Agrarian Structure, and Peasant Mobilization in Modern India</a>
at the University of Virginia. His presentation on that occasion, titled
"<a
href="http://www.virginia.edu/~soasia/symsem/kisan/papers/swami.html"
target="_blank">Swami and Friend</a>" was a wide-ranging survey of
peasant activism in twentieth century India. It was that range of issues
that were the primary focus of Das' scholarship together with an
especially sensitive portrayal of his native Bihar, and more
specifically of his north Bihar village. He was particularly candid in
describing the remoteness of most urban intellectuals to the meaning of
what was and wasn't happening in Bihar. For Das these observers were
portrayed in <a
href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/arvindndas.html#online"
target="_blank"> his many op-ed essays</a> in the Indian press as "the
chattering classes," who knew less about Bihar than they did about
Kosovo, Chechnya, or Sierra Leone.

<p>In an effort to bring a more subtle understanding to the
experience of Bihar, Arvind organized an international conference on "Bihar
in the World and the World in Bihar," which convened at Patna, December
16-19, 1997 under the sponsorship of the Asian Development Research
Institute (ADRI) of Patna and the European Science Foundation of Paris.
The volume emerging from that conference, edited by Arvind Das, is
currently in press with Manohar Publishers of New Delhi.

<p>Arvind Das was a man of many parts. Beyond
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/arvindndas.html#books" target="_blank">
the eleven books</a>
which he either wrote or edited he was in every sense an activist and a
publicist. We have lost a friend and a colleague of vast energy and
extraordinary intellectual and political vitality. He will be missed not only in
India, but in the world beyond Patna and Delhi. We will especially miss the
decency he brought to his work and to all of his associations, just as we will
miss the insights of the human condition he conveyed in everything he wrote.
