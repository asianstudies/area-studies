<p>For almost four decades, I have wanted to know about <i>Shin Shinaki Boobla Boo</i>, a 
film most readers of this review would never have heard of. There is a very personal reason for
this desire. Long years ago, I was old by my brother that my pet name was derived from this film
whose title apparently intrigued my father. He never saw the movie, but was sufficiently struck by
its unconventional title to name me (for domestic purposes) after it. And, in reciprocation, I called
him Boo, instead of Baba. Sadly, he has missed reading this piece by nine months, but I stand
informed about the film behind my pet name. Wish he could too.

<p><i>Shin Shinaki Boobla Boo</i>, probably released in 1952 (a question mark follows the date in the
entry in this volume; Dad, I recall, told me it was 1954, on the eve of my birth), was the story of
lovers Shin Shinaki (Rehana, playing ballet dancer) and Boobla Boo (Ranjan, playing bandit).
Don't ask me who Rehana and Ranjan were; I'd never heard of them. But, the story was by
Ramanand Sagar who needs no introduction, as the cliche goes. "Sunday ke Sunday" C.
Ramchandra, the much-neglected musical genius, composed the music; P.L. Santoshi not only
produced and directed but also wrote the dialogues and lyrics and Sadhona Bose, the fusion
danseuse, performed in a lead role.

<p>All that is, perhaps, trivia. What isn't is that <i>Shin Shinaki Boobla Boo</i> was the "unlikely first victim
of the Central Government's power to overrule the Censor Board, an action enabled by the Indian
Cinematograph Act passed that year," the <i>Encyclopaedia of Indian Cinema </i>informs us. The film,
initially given a U (Universal Viewing) certificate, was subsequently banned on account of its "low
moral tone" and also because it "throws the glamour of romance and heroism over criminal
characters, treats sacred subjects irreverently and is, in consequence, opposed to the interests of
public decency and morality". The ban was later revoked, but the controversy predictably spelt
doom for the film's commercial prospects. My pet name has quite a history!

<p>The <i>Encyclopaedia</i> is not merely about trivia. Nor is it a mere reference guide for forgetful
foray-ists into <i>filmi</i> writing. The exhaustive volume has a remarkably holistic approach to cinema
as the most powerful medium of popular culture, the most potent building block of contemporary
Indian nationalism.

<p>What distinguishes this encyclopaedia from standard commercial ventures into this lucrative arena
is the political philosophy t hat the authors Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willeman attempt to
impose upon it. Without beating about the bush, the authors of this authoritative compilation
reveal their politico-academic predilection. Through the deconstruction of India's cinematographic
evolution, they have set about to unravel the complexities of the Indian "nation" and the character
of the state. Consequently, politics is deftly woven into the introductory narratives.

<p>Entries, too, have a startling political undertone. Why else should
here be an engrossing item on "Naxalite" in an encyclopaedia of Indian cinema? Admittedly,
however, his unlikely entry is the briefest yet most succinct account of the Maoist-inspired,
ultra-left, extra-parliamentarian movement, dubbed 'infantile disorder" by establishmentarian
Marxists who freely quoted Lenin to suit their purpose in debunking this challenge. The
introductory accounts in the volume, not surprisingly, therefore, have repeated references to
Marxist historiography on India, from D.D. Kosambi to the Subaltern school. A cynic would have
been tempted to sarcastically remark, "<i>Begani Shaadi mein, Abdulla Deewana</i>" (from <i>Jis Desh
Mein Ganga Behti Hai</i>). But the compilation is so masterly that such ideological forays must be
overlooked.

<p>The only problem is that future scholars of India's popular culture at places like UCLA, Columbia,
Oxbridge, Witswatersrand and, perhaps, even JNU, might just be naive enough to interpret Indian
cinema within the matrix determined by the compilers of the volume. They might actually start
linking the political preamble given to every year since 1896 in the initial pages, to cinematic
developments of that year.

<p>It's interesting, for instance, to suggest that the lilting "<i>Cheen-o-Arab hamara, Hindustan hamara,
Rene ko ghar nehi hai, Saara jahaan hamara</i>" penned  by Sahir Ludhianvi for Phir Subah Hogi was
aimed at mocking Jawaharlal Nehru's self-important assertions of friendship with Zhou Enlai and
Gamal Abdel Nasser, his cohorts in the now defunct Non-Aligned Movement. But can we please
leave a good song atone? There is too much of the ideological baggage of the '60s in the volume
and I wish the authors had not burdened us with their political philosophy But then, this is the
volume's commercial USP. To that extent, can one fault the Rajadhyaksha-Willeman duo?

<p>While this 658-page magnum opus is not intended for cover-to-cover reading, film buffs will find
some delightful factoids strewn across its superbly designed and exciting pages. Looking up the
entry on Laxmikant Shantaram Kudalkar and Pyarelal Ramprasad Sharma, my favourite music
directors, I stumbled upon a gem: Pyarelal learnt music from a Goan, Anthony Gonsalves, which
prompted the duo to compose the '70s hit number "My name is Anthony Gonslaves," deftly
scripted by their steady lyricist, Anand Bakshi.

<p>There are, however, some significant omissions in the compilation. For instance, I was distressed
not to find an entry on Tannia, although there is a passing mention of her in the entry on
Shobhana Samarth. Talking about Tanuja, another surprising omission is Sandow MMA
Chinnappa Devar, celebrated boss of Dandayuthapari Films, makers of a series of highly
successful animal-oriented films in the '70s. Devar's first commercial megabit, <i>Haathi Mera Saathi</i>, 
starred Tanuja opposite the then reigning superstar Rajesh Khanna and marked her comeback to
the Hindi screen. Considering her virtuoso performances in semi-commercial Basu Bhattachharya
ventures like <i>Anubhav</i> and <i>Aavishkar</i>, surely the impish daughter of Shobhana, sister of Nutan
and mother of Kajol merited a decent entry.

<p>But then, the task that the authors set for themselves was, in Ashish Rajadhyaksha's introductory
words, "gigantomanic". Had they confined themselves to Hindi alone, the project would still have
been stupendous. But they have expanded its scope to cover every regional language in which
significant films have been made over the last 100 years. "Himalayan" would be an understatement
for the courage and commitment such an adventure must have entailed.

<p>Given the mind-blowing size of the canvas on which Rajadhyaksha and Willeman have attempted
to paint the myriad tales of the world's entertainment industry, relatively minor instances of
oversight deserve to be overlooked. As they themselves hope, this volume should serve as the
beacon for other students of the craft to compile even more complete encyclopaediae. Perhaps,
some day, we shall have an exhaustive compilation of the entire history of Indian cinema.  It will
probably require several CD-ROMs to fit in all the data, but the effort will be worth the
endeavour.  After all, Indian cinema does not belong to India alone.  It is part of humankind's
modern heritage.
