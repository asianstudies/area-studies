In <i>Hybrid Histories</i>, Ajay Skaria seeks to appear as one, and only one, of the protagonists.
He does not conceal himself, as authors of history are meant to do, by making historical 'facts'
speak for themselves. On the contrary, he over-exposes and over-states himself, lending to his text
a tentative and speculative mood, where every detail is admitted but not sanctified as the truth,
and where the irresolubility and contrariness of every detail becomes an occasion for the historian
to attempt an articulation of difference. Sometimes, the people he writes about appear in the text
as long quotes, almost putting the rest of the text, i.e. the author's own words, in quotes as well.
Sometimes, the people's reactions to the author's presence itself become the subject of the story,
making the text appear, through multiple displacements, as a story of other people's stories about
a historian's writing of a story. All this makes <i>Hybrid Histories</i> a unique narrative-not about the
reality and plausibility of the historian's interpretation; that would be unsurprising and perhaps
merely self-vindicating, but about a historian's search for clues to a radical future, which exceeds
the past and exceeds even present notions of the possible. In this, <i>Hybrid Histories</i> is
encouragingly and happily anti-historicist--that is, it works against imagining the future as merely
a logical and chronological fulfilment and completion of tendencies of the past.</td>

But let me first briefly say what the book is about. <i>Hybrid Histories is</i> a story of the
Dangs or the hill-area of Western India between 1800 and 1920s, a story of peoples like the Bhils
and the Koknis, these days commonsensically and unreasonably called 'tribes'. Through a reading
of Dangi <i>goth</i> or stories, the book attempts-and this is crucial to my mind-not the reconstruction
of a lost or forgotten Dangi past, but the construction of a 'counter-aesthetic' to colonial
modernity. It is not necessary to determine, in the final instances, whether this counter-esthetic
'truly' was in the past, or whether it is a Dangi or a historian's imagination of the possibility of
such a counter-aesthetic-so long as such an alternative can be invoked as the critical and
existential potential of a different future. Skaria shows that both Dangi memories and the
historians' archives can be read to argue that 'wildness' as a mode of being has neither inherently
nor historically been antagonistic to 'civilisation.'  This antagonism is a myth imposed by Western
modernity and its apparent and self-validating colonial history of civilising and mastering nature.
In the Dangs for instance, wildness has been in an agonistic, not antagonistic, relation to
mainstream polities. Wildness not only once gave now marginalized 'tribes' a certain edge in
power politics, say vis-a-vis Maratha kingships; wildness also offered a political option to
mainstream politics themselves, as when the Marathas owned upto raids and hunts as a valid way
of negotiating rule and taxes. Wildness, with its attendant options of pleasure, the <i>chut</i> or freedom
to hunt or to travel or to drink, stood for not only a way of life with a difference, but also a
different and desired ideal of both pleasure and power. It was only with colonialism that wildness
was sought to be forcibly contained, and hillpeople and plainspeople physically and conceptually
dichotomized-the former became 'tribes' and the latter 'castes'. The book thus deconstructs the
apparently empirical lessons of history, and the naturalized oppositions like tribe/caste,
wild/civilised, forests/agriculture, state/lineage and so on.

<p>But if this is the theme of <i>Hybrid Histories,</i> to my mind it is the book's narrative technique
which is more crucial. Especially since it is narrative itself which is the book's problematic. Ajay
Skaria admits that the chronologically sequential narrative technique, proper to the discipline of
history-in which the colonial follows the pre-colonial, the modern follows 

[<b>++Page 6</b>] 

the pre-modern, and the 'civilised' follows the wild-fails to enunciate the existential conditions,
where living in and post-colonialism implies at the same time the need and intention of living
<i>beyond and irrespective</i> of colonialism as well. That is, it fails to grasp what is perhaps
chronologically post-colonial, but cannot be taken to succeed colonialism either logically or
temporally. It is these extra-colonial stories that Skaria intends to make his own. This he does, "in
accordance with" Dangi narratives--where <i>moglai</i> stands for the times of <i>chut</i> or freedom,
approximating the historian's 'pre-colonial' and where <i>mandini</i> stands for the time of demarcation
after which <i>chut</i> was lost, approximating the historian's 'colonial' period. Yet it is the difference
between this mode of Dangi temporalization and the historian's conventions of periodization that
is crucial for Skaria. The Dangi <i>moglai,</i> Skaria suggests, does not always precede <i>mandini-but
traverses</i> the latter, such that sites of<i> moglai</i> are actively reclaimed even in times clearly
characterized as colonial. That is, through the deployment of memories -memories not just of the
past but memories of those presently subalternized and lost--Dangis make the colonial present, in
modes of agonism and contravention, at times decisively non-colonial.

<p>To allow this difference between chronological sequence and the Dangi simultaneity of
moglai and <i>mandini,</i> Skaria suggests that his readers read the book in at least two ways. In one
way the book is chapterized by the sequential numbers, 1,2,3 .... and so on. In another way, the
book may he read in the manner 3-10-11-9-16-6 .... and so forth-which he hopes will produce
four supplementary, and necessarily patchy and partial narratives and which in turn will dislocate
the former successional narrative (of pre-colonial and colonial) and its unavoidable historicism.
Skaria hopes that this deliberate hybridization of narratives 
in a single text will not only demonstrate a possible coming together 
of the concerns of Dangi narrators and professional historians,
but also produce the possibility of a temporal contemporaneity 
between the colonial and the extra-colonial.

<p>Skaria's narrative experiment is doubtless daring and productive. Yet it seems to me to
rest too easily on a foregrounding of the thing called the Narrative. True, 
his narrative(s) are self-consciously hybridized, punctuated and 
contaminated threateningly by the sensibility that other
stories do exist and work simultaneously upon the story presently being told; that the politics of
authorization of narratives is more than the fate of a read and reread text; it is also at the same
time the politics of negotiating identities and subalternity. Yet somewhere the phantom-like and
shadowy Idea of the Narrative seems to over-determine and bless with unity the contradictions
and hybridities which Skaria so lovingly and effectively lays out in his text. This is the haunting
and hopeful Narrative which assumes that the world makes sense always already as a narrative,
even though it may be different narratives at different times or, as Skaria's argument goes,
different narratives <i>at the same time.</i> This is the Narrative which knows that meaning is not
merely referentiality but an act of telling to others. So far as that goes, Skaria's text is a beautiful
instance of weaving together provisional and variegated meanings-which appear as being
<i>produced</i> through narrations rather than as being given. Yet, in so far as Skaria visualizes his own
work as singularly "in accordance with" <i>goth</i> or stories, he fails to notice conditions of
marginalized lives--including, ironically, the historian's own--where stories have ceased or where
stories can appear only as an absence to incorrigible narrators like historians. This is perhaps
because to Skaria there is no story-less crevice in the world, which is not a site of explicable and
thereby in principle curable amnesia. And this is perhaps because, like a historian, Skaria ends up
imagining time itself as a narrative sequence, even as he disavows the conflation of time to the
sequentiality of the chronological and numerical mode.

<p>This is a capitalized Narrative which reduces temporalization to itself--as if the laying and
living out of time is in itself narrativization and nothing else. True, temporalization may assume
the narrative form. After all, however fragmented and contrapuntal a narrative, it is recognised as
such in its intention--the temporalizing intention that seeks a resolution at the end, even if the end
appears as a surprising and disturbing lack of resolubility. In this, narratives seek to simulate time
itself, and that not only in their enunciation of a beginning and a end. Narratives seek to simulate
time in their necessary spacing out of moments, which, even when intended as contemporaneous,
cannot be simultaneously read or implied but must admit a sequentiality that involves an awaiting,
a lag between even simultaneous events. And yet, at the same time, the narrative disowns the
irreversibility of time as practised. A narrative can be read from the end, in the way that time
cannot appear, despite memories, in the everyday practice of time. In this, there appears a
complicity between historicism and the Narrative, even as the latter, as narratives, seeks to
explode the unilinearity and singularity of the appropriately Historical Narrative. Because both
hold on to the priority of hindsight, to punctuations between simultaneous events and to the idea
of a <i>knowledge</i> rather than to <i>practices</i> of time and contemporaneity And because this implicit
trust, or shall we say, hope in the Narrative denies possible conditions of existence where time,
and practice, appear as non-narrativizable and irrevocably ruptured.

<p>To me, the colonial condition appears as one such moment where narratives become
impossible. The construction of a society as an agglomeration of different times--'primitive' and
historical, 'tribal' and 'civilisational'--in itself defies the narrative form. For internal temporal
mismatches disallow the unity of a narrative, a unity of the kind that hyperreal Europe can assume
in modernity. And the colonized seems able to appear only in a visual/spatial montage-like frame,
unified by a state (centre) and a territory (substructure) but not by the possibility of narrative or
temporal continuity. It is not incorrect to say for the colonized, that the "nation is narrated", but
to elevate the Narrative to a singular mode of being is to fall to notice that excess which remains
unnarratable--not because a narrative is, or all narratives are, exclusive, but because many pasts,
presents and futures become disassociated from all senses of precedents, which makes even the
recognition of novelty and novels problematic. After all, colonialism appears as a profound and
radical externality to local narratives, as Skaria so effectively shows, as a destiny which is fully
undeserved and mexplicable in terms of the colonized's own story. In this, even as the 'primitive' is
constructed as a primarily story-telling people in contrast to the reasoning Western mind, it is
narrative resolution which is what is denied to her-because the 'primitive' must exist in modernity,
in a time not her own.

<p>To see the temporal contradictions produced by colonial modernity as embodied in
narratives, even if hybridized, is in a way to understate them. Perhaps it will be more productive
to understand the rupturing of worlds-as instanced by colonialism-as creating the impossibility of
the narrative form, the impossibility of narrative temporal resolution. This will not make narratives
vanish from our reality, but will refigure narrative itself as one kind of <i>practice</i> that engages with
many possibilities, including the possibility of the impossibility of the story. I insist on reading
narratives as a practice and one amongst many, so that narratives do not appear to us as just
another kind of archive, an archive of given and available texts-is what seems to happen so very
often in Skaria's work, clearly in spite of himself. Dangi stories appear to offer resources to the
historian who writes his own narrative in two modes-one in the simple present of traditional
anthropology (e.g. "Imaginary <i>goth</i> are also narrated at casual or spur-of-the moment gatherings,
when men and women are relaxing in the evenings ... In contrast ...<i> vadilcha goth</i> posit and
intimate connection with time and space..', ) and the other in the simple past of conventional
historiography (e.g. "Because the forests were a space of masculine wildness, the ideal forester
was ascribed qualities similar to those expected of the Bhil Agent...", ). In both these narrative 
modes, Dangi story-telling appears not as practices negotiating time and futures but as instances
of a body of information which evidence, both the historian, the Dangi past and Dangi identity
through time. Skana does not let Dangis act out their own provisional narratives in the way he
himself acts out his own.

<p>The historian's narrative-centricity comes through most clearly in the last chapter of
Skaria's book, which conceptualizes Dangi resistance and rebellion. Skaria takes his cues from
goth in order to go beyond models of opposition and inversion which traditionally frame histories
of rebellion. And this he does by calling Dangi resistance "epic resistance"resistance as an act of
"exceeding the dominant through local and regional narratives". In making the epic into an
adjective of rebellion rather than into a verb in itself, Skaria tends to conflate practice with the
narrative form-for he says clearly that to him the term epic characterizes the mode in which Dangi
resistance "draw(s), flamboyantly and exultantly, on the tropes of imaginary goth". As if
imaginaries are the monopoly of narrative genres. After all, practices for the future are necessarily
that which seek to be free from precedents and given 'fact', and therefore must foreground the
imaginary. Even science would be nothing without 'science fiction'.To me, goth and rebellion,
seem to offer more for the future if read as a matter of enunciating time, rather than as a matter of
a narrative genre-the former and the latter may be associated but are different imperatives.

<p>But how can one think if faced with contingencies where narratives appear impossible?
What can one do with such radical excesses-not the excess to a narrative, but the unnarratable
excess? Skaria himself has an answer when he repeatedly evokes a politics of hope. 1 would like
to interpret his principle of hope as an imagination of a possible future which is presently
impossible to put into a narrativebecause there is no antecedent which predicts it, no precedent it
has to abide by and no past it need be continuous to. Yet it is a possible future, if only because
memories of the past too offer the vision of moments which as yet remain in excess of all
histories, which exist nevertheless in practice. Such excessive moments of the past must be
invoked because they promise and await a future. Perhaps, only in such a future will the
unnarratable and surplus moments of our pasts fall into a story.<p>
