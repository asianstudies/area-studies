Indian politics is at a crucial transitory phase, with the of Congress-dominated system having
given way to a new order whose contours are only gradually taking shape. Nothing is as striking
as the manner in which the Bharatiya Janata Party, avowedly a party out to replace the old 
consensus, has had to tack with the wind. The articulation of itsown ideologically defined view of
the world has had to be muted to help form governments in New Delhi on three occasions by
relying on political formations that do not subscribe to its faith. The rise of critical actors in New
Delhi with roots in particular constituent units of the Indian Union may not be a new
phenomenon. But the sheer clout wielded by such regional parties is a pointer to a tectonic shift
in the polity. Much of the future will hinge on the relationship between the newly aspiring
hegemonic force, the BJP, and the configurations of power at the level of the states.

It is the focus on this specific dimension of politics that is the abiding strength of this new
collection edited by <b>Roy and Wallace</b>. Each of the key papers takes up a specific state or region
but the overall theme is always in sight.That Aral Bihari Vajpayee's party constitutes the core of
the National Democratic Alliance is clear but there is still some doubt over where the fulcrum of
power lies. No single party has been able to repeat Rajiv Gandhi's feat of winning a clear
majority as far back as 1984. In such a context, it is still unclear whether the present regime will
see a revival of a declining Hindutva vote base or a shift of the terms of the equation in favour of
smaller regional players. The Prime Minister may often be projected as the logical successor to
key personalities like Jawaharlal Nehru or Indira Gandhi, but neither was so heavily reliant on the
shifting sands of coalition politics as today's governments are. Where precisely is the tail
and where is the dog: the question still hangs in the air, awaiting an answer in a highly fluid
situation.<p>

Much of the flux is directly due to the fragmentation of the political system-and indeed of civil
society itself-in the Gangetic plain. <b>Pradeep Chhiber and Irfan Nooruddin</b> lucidly trace the
collapse of the old loyalties and outline the forces that have increased party competitiveness over
the last decade in the Hindi belt. Though often seen as a logical consequence of Mandal and
Mandir, these are only symbols of a deeprooted process by which the old social alliance that
underwrote the dominance of Congress for the better part of four decades came undone. What is
equally important is the reduced clout of players from Uttar Pradesh in a situation where none of
them is able to hegemonize the political space the way 

parties are in other, less populous states of the Union. <b>Kanchan Chandra</b>'s portrayal of the
increasingly pronounced ethnification of politics raises doubts whether Hindutva or Mandal or
even Dalit power will in the short run be able to establish any kind of dominance over public
agendas, let alone provide stable governance.<p>

<b>Virginia Van Dyke</b> demonstrates the Janus-faced mobilization strategy of the Hindutva forces in
letting religion-based front organisations run ahead of

the political wing of the movement in raising emotive slogans. Yet, this strategy that yielded rich
dividends in the early 1990s looks set to give diminishing returns in the days ahead.<p>

In neighbouring Bihar, the ascendancy of the BJP and its allies in the form of the Samata Party by
1998 appeared at first sight to signal an end to the politics of Mandal. But the divergent social
bases of the partners conceal deeper fissures that are unlikely to subside over time. The saffron
platform virtually sweeps the southern region of Bihar on the promise of creating a separate
Vananchal (aka Jharkhand) state. Yet, in the north it still heavily relies on combining with the
anti-Laloo Prasad Yadav Other Backward Castes who enable it to overcome the '<i>Savanna </i>versus
Mandal' divide. What is striking in a close study

such as <b>Binoy Shanker Prasad</b>'s is the enduring social coalition of the minorities and Yadavs on
the ground. Only an alliance can defeat him, but the durability of such an arrangement is suspect
from the very start. For all this, Bihar fits the epithet of `bi-nodal' politics used by the editors in
the Introduction, with UP being the sole medium term exception among the major states.<p>

The extent to which political loyalties have been fragmented is 

clearest in the case of Maharashtra. The alliance with the Dalit-led Republican Party of India and
the Samajwadi Party was crucial. It ensured that the Congress was able to overcome the challenge
posed by the Sena-BJP combine in 1998.  Once the Congress Party and its allies fragmented their
base in the following year, they were bound to lose in the Lok Sabha polls. The endurance of the
losers in 1998 was clear in the way in which they actually increased their support base but lost
because their opponents unified all opposition votes in one basket.<p>

Yet it is in the south and the east that alliance-based politics is really on trial. <b>Harold A. Gould</b>'s
paper shows how the Hindutva groups were able to profit from the collapse and fracturing of the
Janata Dal and expand on their first base south of the Vindhyas. But social bases of parties are not
quite as stable as they appear. Karnataka witnessed a Janata sweep in 1996, a Hindutva victory
the next time round and then a Congress comeback in the 13th general elections. In neighbouring
Andhra Pradesh, it is only by riding piggyback on the Telugu Desam that the `national' Bharatiya
Janata Party contained the Congress. But the 12th Lok Sabha polls were crucial in giving the BJP
the crucial bargaining power with a strong regional ally. It appears

that the key to success at the hustings may lie in accepting a subordinate position to a regional
satrap. This will work only so long as there is a broad area of agreement between two parties.
Once one of them grows stronger, the line up may change. Though the structure of politics is
more stable than in the north, the alignments are not set in a freeze. The Congress-AIDMK
accord, which hela firm for four elections in a row, may prove to be an exception.<p>

<b>Ramashray Roy</b>'s article on Orissa has a significant insight into the factors that have enabled
another alliance to endure in two successive polls. The Biju Janta Dal's support is mostly along
the coast and the saffron party's voters are in the tribal-inhabited hinterland. A regional party that
is a sub-regional force requires the crutch of a national one. In fact, it is the nascent nature of the
local outfit that makes it easier to deal with than the more deep-rooted and enduring
regional political formations in the deep south.<p>

One of the factors that has undoubtedly helped create an atmosphere for the growth of communal
platforms in the country has been the state of affairs in Punjab and Kashmir since the 1980s. In the
former, the contours of an order state only reemerged with the victories in 1996 and 1998 of the
Akali Dal led alliances. The latter polls saw a return to the old lineup of the two saffron parties,
the Akalis and the BJP joining hands. <b>Kumar</b> skilfully shows how their complementary social
bases enabled success in reaping a harvest of votes and seats. In turn this required a toning down
of sectarian agendas. This in turn worked only as long as the Akalis were united and their own
record in government did not become a public issue.<p>

A vastly different and disturbing picture is evident in Jammu and Kashmir. In perhaps the most
significant paper in the entire volume <b>Reeta Chowdhari-Tremblay</b> reaches the conclusion based on
intensive research that, "The Indian government's faith that the electoral process has been
successful in curbing the nationalist movement in the Valley is unwarranted." This is one case
where the law-governed process has simply broken down and the electoral system exists only in
name.<p>

All in all, the book raises critical questions to which there are no easy answers. It may however be
useful to place its key argument in a wider context. The two premier national parties have over
the last decade found it difficult to exceed over half the popular vote. This reflects and in turn
exacerbates a phenomenon in which regional parties gain prominence and even a share of power
at the federal level. The central factor in the ability of the BJP to form and manage a coalition has
been its willingness to trade its own ideological agenda for the politics of consensus. The
collection does not raise the critical issue of how far such steps may go. In fairness, this is the
subject for another study. What does emerge however is a rich and incisive look at the dynamics
of politics in several key regions. Wallace and Roy have produced a work that will be invaluable
to specialist and lay reader alike. But the turns that lie ahead are such that the issues
raised here will remain with us for a long time to come.<p>
