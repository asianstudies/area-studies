<font size="+4"><b>T</b></font>he publication of 
Swami Sahajanand Saraswati's tract,
<i><b>Khet Mazdoor</b></i> on agricultural labour and the rural
poor is an intellectual land mark of sorts. The small
tract, running into 80-odd pages in the original, was
written by Swami Sahajanand in 1941
in Hazaribagh Central Jail. But, like
many of his manuscripts, it could not
be published either during or after his
lifetime. The credit for its publication
goes to Walter Hauser, an American
scholar who first came to India in the
late 1950s as a research student and
worked intermittently at the Bihta
Ashram where he saw the original
"copybook manuscript" of the
Swami's work which he microfilmed.<p>

It is this copy of <i><b>Khet Mazdoor</b></i> that
appears in its present form now. It is a
bilingual edition with the original
Hindi text printed along with its English 
translation, and supported with
extensive notes and a glossary.<p>

The publication of <i><b>Khet Mazdoor</b></i>,
almost 43 years after the death of the
Swami, is significant in more ways than
one. As a historical text, it provides
access to the thought and mind of one
of the more remarkable thinkers and
doers of our time. This text is a 
product of those critical years when the
peasant movement was evolving into
a broad spectrum agrarian campaign
with the focus gradually shifting to
wards "the poorest of the poor" or khet 
mazdoors.  Apart from making an immensely 
valuable document available
to English and Hindi readers together
in a single, well produced volume, it
leads an interested reader into the
complexities of translation as well. It
is one of the very few books of its kind
to appear in a bilingual edition.
Equally interesting is the fact that
though the tract was composed way
back in 1941, it still remains fresh and
valid even today. Nowhere does the
passage of time diminish its original
appeal as is so often the fate of such
topical texts. It endures because it is
rooted in the experiences of life and is
written in a racy, vigorous Hindi idiom.<p>

<i><b>Khet Mazdoor</b></i> marks a new phase
in Swami Sahajanand's long and ever
evolving career as a thinker and activist. 
A brief recall of the intellectual 
and political climate of the period
shows that the popular, and to some
extent even academic, image of the
Swami, who set out as an ascetic of the
Satnami order, was that of a caste politician 
and political activist of the Kisan
Sabha, working in the interest of well
to do or at best middle level peasants.
He was constantly under attack from
forces. opposed to the Kisan Movement 
and was often accused of giving
precedence to the well-to-do <i><b>kisans</b></i> 
over the more depressed <i><b>khet
mazdoors</b></i>, the poorest of the poor. It
is true that the Swami had long been
active in organising the middle peas
ants. But in the later phase of his life,
he turned towards the marginal peas
ants and landless labourers. He writes
in his introduction to <i><b>Khet Mazdoor</b></i>:
"If peasants are closely associated with
cultivation and its related problems,
agricultural labourers have an even
more direct and intimate link with the
productive processes of agriculture.
They are the root, the very foundation,
literally the hand and feet of cultivation. 
So whenever questions of 
agriculture and the peasantry are raised, 
the problems of agriculture labour 
must inevitably be at the 
forefront of any such discussion."

This signifies a radical departure as 
the change he sought was 
transformational and total and it rested on the
perception that the agricultural worker
occupying the lowest rung was 
the ultimate measure of things. As the 
editor comments, "Sahajanand was 
systematically moving in the direction of
an activist representing the marginal
poor, whether peasants or landless 
agricultural labourers or some 
permutation of the two." This small volume
attests to this and presents the Swami
in a new robe. He writes in his introduction: 
"Kisan Sabha must direct its
energies first and foremost to the 
agricultural labourers, because finally,
they are the worst sufferers." Walter
Hauser rightly observes that his is not
simply a political statement but the
personal testament of someone who
understood what less-than-minimum
wages meant, who understood the nature 
of debts and the bondage it often
forced on the poor and, perhaps most
profoundly, who understood the mal
treatment an agrarian society and 
culture forced on the poorest of the land.<p>

<i><b>Khet Mazdoor</b></i> has Lenin's words
from <i><b>April Theses</b></i> as its motto: "The
agrarian programme must be centred
around the Soviets of Agricultural
Labourers Deputies." So, from the
very outset, it's the agricultural
labourers that's going to be the
nucleus of the agrarian programme,
not the kisans and never the <i><b>kulaks</b></i>. But
the agricultural labourers have to seek
out their allies and identify their enemies. 
In his brief introduction, the
Swami explains that kisans and agricultural 
labourers are all peasants and
must, therefore, pursue their political
agenda of justice and freedom in a
single, unified peasant movement.<p>

In the first chapter, Swami
Sahajanand places the problem of 
<i><b>khet-mazdoors</b></i> in a historical perspective.
Scanning across centuries, he comes to
the conclusion that <i><b>khet mazdoors</b></i>, too,
are <i><b>kisans</b></i>, "<i><b>kisans</b></i> without land". For
him, a <i><b>khet mazdoor</b></i> is not like an 
industrial worker or wage-worker and,
therefore, the problem has to be seen
from a different angle altogether. He
concludes with the theme that the distress 
of a <i><b>khet mazdoor</b></i> is not defined
by caste, community or religion, and
that "it is not limited only to untouchables 
and lower castes". The Swami,
thus, refutes the myth so assiduously
built up and propagated today by some
that agricultural labourers and de
pressed castes are synonyms and that
caste and class are interchangeable. He
warns against any such reduction of
class to caste. As he sees it, the class
of agricultural labourers is a massive
combination of the poorer segments
of all the castes.<p>

The third chapter closely examines
the problems of wages, indebtedness,
and debt bondage afflicting the <i><b>khet
mazdoors</b></i>. The only way to break this
cycle, he argues, is to meet the agricultural 
labourer's hunger for land,
thereby providing a minimum basis for
a stable livelihood.<p>

In the fourth chapter, the Swami
directly confronts the inherent conflict in 
the relation between peasants
and the agricultural labourers in their
employ. He writes: "It is important
to note here that the wage question
and that of land are intimately linked.
If the land problem is solved, that of
wages will also be solved... I have 
included agricultural labourers in the
category of <i><b>kisans</b></i> precisely because of
this interconnectedness of the land
problem."<p>

Swami Sahajanand does not see any
basic contradiction between the interest 
of <i><b>kisans </b></i>and that of <i><b>khet mazdoors</b></i>.
He advocates an alliance of small <i><b>kisans</b></i>
and <i><b>khet mazdoors</b></i> as "in the situation
which exists today, the struggle between 
the agricultural labourers and
the <i><b>kisans</b></i> is essentially one of 
fighting over crumbs".<p>

But shouldn't the <i><b>khet mazdoor</b></i>s
have a separate organisation? On page
114, the Swami suggests that the <i><b>khet
mazdoors</b></i> be in the Kisan Sabha and
also have an organisation of their own.  
But on page 118, he makes a slight re
vision when he says, "Those who presume 
from Russian history that there
should be no separate organisation of
any kind of agricultural labourers, nor
should any effort in that direction be
made, do not fully realise the Indian
situation." <p> 

The Swami frequently refers to the 
Soviet experience and quotes at length
from Lenin and Stalin. He expresses
the complex socioeconomic relation
ship through a metaphor of a snake-frog-insect 
triangle where a frog, itself
half stuck in the jaws of a snake, snaps
at an insect that happens to pass by. In
this triangle, the <i><b>khet mazdoors</b></i> are the
hapless insects, the "poorest of the
poor", while the middle peasants are
signified by the frog.<p>

This small tract establishes the <i><b>khet
mazdoors</b></i> as the basic unit of the Indian 
agrarian situation and also as the
prime mover of socioeconomic transformations.<p>

It would not be out of place to recall 
here that just before his death the
Swami had assigned the job of
organising <i><b>khet mazdoors</b></i> to 
Khadagdhari Mishra alias Tumaria Baba at the
state Kisan Sabha conference at Rajgir
in May, 1950. Incidentally, the 
foundation conference of the All India 
Khet Mazdoor Union was held under
the presidentship of the same Tumaria
Baba.<p>

It's a pity that our social sciences
have not yet made much use of the
discursive material available in Indian
languages, particularly in Hindi. This
book provides scholars unfamiliar with
Hindi texts a rare opportunity of 
reading the original with the help of an 
attendant translation. This is perhaps the
first attempt of its kind that places a
Hindi prose-text side by side with its
English rendering, allowing the reader
a fuller appreciation of the subject.<p>

This small tract offers a new 
perspective on the entire agrarian 
problem. Though Western concepts and
terminology has frequently been used,
the overall perspective remains 
essentially Indian. The Swami's knowledge
in economics and politics is brought
to bear upon his first hand experiences
in the field.<p>

Walter Hauser's translation is as
close to the original as it could 
possibly be. It retains the 
colloquial tenor 
and emotional fervour of the original.
Hauser takes pains to examine the
Hindi text and make requisite corrections 
and improvements. He goes back
in the field.<p>

Walter Hauser's translation is as
close to the original as it could possibly 
be. It retains the colloquial tenor
and emotional fervour of the original.
Hauser takes pains to examine the
Hindi text and make requisite 
corrections and improvements. He goes back
to the original sources referred to by
the Swami and cleanses the text of
referential impurities, if any. For 
example, Hauser corrects the "percentage
figures" as reproduced unsuspectingly
by the Swami from his basic source,
Rajni Palme Dutt's <i><b>India Today</b></i>. It's a
thoroughly edited and annotated text
in the best traditions of a good re
search publication. As to the authenticity 
of the Hindi text, Triveni Sharma
Sudhakar attests to the fact that it is
the same original copybook manuscript 
that he had the privilege of reading while 
serving as the Swami's personal assistant 
between 1947 and 1949.<p>

The English rendering is faithful to
the original, though a word-to-word
comparison shows some minor lapses
like the use of "fighting over curbs"
for the picturesque <i><b>kafan-khasoti</b></i> 
(shroud-snatching)" or "personal
property" for <i><b>vyaktighat sampati</b></i> 
instead of the technically 
accepted "private property."<p>
