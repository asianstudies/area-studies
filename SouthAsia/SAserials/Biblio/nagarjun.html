     Despite its apparent openness and transparency, the life and
oeuvre of the pseudonymous Nagarjun is complex, problematic and
ever fascinating. The ambiguities begin with the date of his
birth, which remain unknown--bio graphical entries and blurbs,
record it as 1911 and he himself supported it but, on the other
hand, insisted that he was 18 or 19 in 1931 when he was tricked
and inveigled into marrying his 12-year-old bride.<p>

     His father, Gokul Mishra, an orthodox Brahmin from the poor,
backward yet culturally-rich Mithila region of North Bihar, whose
family had seen better and prouder days, was comparatively
unlearned in his community but revelled in compensating this lack
with his pietistic pilgrimagery, lechery and brutality. The son,
named Vaidyanath, had seen Gokul Mishra threaten his terminally
tubercular wife with beheading by an axe when the bed-ridden
woman begged him to curb his adulterous debaucheries. Vaidyanath
lost his mother when he was only six. He also witnessed his poor,
maternally affectionate, widowed aunt nearly lose her life in
aborting an illegitimate child by his father. Gokul Mishra was
extremely cruel and callous to his only son, denying him proper
schooling and compelling him to traditional, rudimentary learning
of Sanskrit in the ancestral village of Tarauni and neighbouring
areas.

remains predominantly a poet of politics and people, of the
peasantry and of the proletariat. He was angrier than any angry
young poet but also possessed a typically robust Maithil-Bihari
sense of humour and savage satire</center></b></td></tr></table></center>

     The hostility between the loveless teenager, now a married-
and-rebellious son, and his unredeemable father came to such a
flashpoint that Vaidyanath left his uncomprehending child-bride
in her own father's household and forsook his home and village
for Varanasi, the ultimate destination of all would -be Sanskrit
scholars which also had a sizeable Maithil Brahmin enclave. Thus
began his wanderlust.<p>

     Before he arrived in Varanasi, then the centre of Hindi
language, literature and journalism--though Calcutta and Allahabad
were close rivals--Vaidyanath was barely comfortable in any other
language other than his mother-tongue, Maithili, a full-fledged
tongue spoken and written in a small region but with close family
ties with Hindi, Bengali and other neighbouring regional
languages. It is not known under which poetic and emotional
influences the adolescent Vaidyanath began writing poetry in
Maithili, acquiring the <i>nom-de-plume</i> of "Vaideh", the Bodiless,
but one of his first poems from his self-exile is a nostalgic
paean to Mother(land) Mithila.<p>

     Soon, the prolonged stay in Varanasi, coupled with journeys
in the Hindi heartland and visits to the Hindi-speaking areas of
Calcutta, and a near-insatiable hunger for poetry, fiction and
socio-political information, available only through Hindi--
Vaidyanath hardly knew any English and would be exposed to
Bengali much later--made him a bi-lingual. It is difficult to say
what was greater, the force of the <i>lingua franca</i> or the nascent
genius of the restless young poet but the year 1935 saw the
publication of the first Hindi poem in the weekly <i>Vishvabandhu</i>
from Lahore by "Vaidyanath Mishra". Under the influence of the
Arya Samaj, the Hindus in Punjab were adopting Hindi and there
was a literary-cultural vacuum. Next, one finds "Acharya
Vaidyanath Mishra" as the editor of the Hindi monthly <i>Dipak</i>
published from Abohar, district Ferozepur, Punjab in 1935-36.
Already in double self-exile, the restless wanderer would soon
impose a third upon himself.<p>

     The stay in Varanasi had taken him away from Vedic
ritualistic Sanskrit and mysteriously and inexplicably, placed
him under the benign Sarnath gaze of the Compassionate One.
Vaidyanath now craved to become a Buddhist in the company of none
other than the communist-agitator-Tibetologist-Buddhologist monk
Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan, a kindred wanderer-explorer-
author. Bidding his "Last Obeisance" to the Mother Mithila in
Maithili from Varanasi in November 1936, Vaidyanath, now a young
man, left for Ceylon, the only true abode of Buddhism in South
Asia, via Calcutta and South India.<p>

     This remains the most crucial decision taken by Nagarjun in
his life, as he was known thereafter, having taken the vows of a
Bhikkhu in the Vidyalankar Parivena of Kelaniya. He had known
enough sorrow in his youth and was only just becoming aware of
its causes in Varanasi but it was in this campus in Sri Lanka
that he discovered the heady brew of Buddhism mixed with
socialism. Nagarjun was exposed to the writings and precepts of
Marx, Lenin and Stalin. He hasn't written much about his
experiences in Kelaniya and one doesn't know much of what
happened to him there besides the initiation into Buddhism and
Marxism but suddenly he decided to return to Bihar to join the
Sonepur camp of the so-called Summer School of Politics run by
his new political mentor, the redoubtable kisan leader, 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/SouthAsia/Misc/Sss/sahaj.html">
Swami Sahajanand Saraswati</a>. The latter was assisted by committed
Socialists, Communists and Congressmen in running politico -
ideological classes for workers and activists.<p>

     Nagarjun took part in the Ambari farmers' struggle and was
arrested and jailed on 20 February 1939. Earlier, in what is
perhaps his first poem in Hindi, published in 1937, he wistfully
salutes all those who had died unsung, unwept and unfulfilled.
The language is shorn of all ostentation, the grip of rhyme and
metre is near-perfect. A new, young Hindi poet had finally
arrived--one who was apparently at home with the ancient and
medieval lyric traditions but was bold enough to experiment with
blank and free verse as well.<p>

     Nagarjun was ambidextrous in many ways. He returned to his
homeland and his wife and led an intermittent conjugal life
between 1941-52, the couple moving from place to place in search
of livelihood and the wife compelled to return to their Tarauni
base from time to time. In 1941 he published two of his longer
Maithili poems, <i>Boorh Var</i> (The Aged Bridegroom) and <i>Vilap</i>
(Lament) as pamphlets and sold them himself on passenger trains
quite successfully.<p>

     1943 saw Nagarjun return to his interest in Tibetology and
Rahul Sankrityayan. He left for Tibet, fully aware that his
ailing father would not survive till he returned--neither had
forgiven the other. Equally peremptorily, Nagarjun was to lose
nearly all interest in practising Buddhism, Buddhology and mass
movements. But he never returned to formal Hinduism and never
renounced Marxism. He abhorred his father for his inhuman
treatment of his wife, his sister-in-law and his own progeny and
he never forgot those unfortunate creatures but he himself never
settled down to a life of home and hearth, wife and children and
chose to wander the length and breadth of the country,
sporadically returning as a prodigal husband-and-father to
Tarauni.<p>

     He continued to write both in Maithili and Hindi and while
only two Hindi pamphlet-poems, <i>Shapath</i> (Vow) and <i>Chana Jor Garam</i>
('Mighty' Hot Grams) were circulated in 1948 and 1952
respectively, his first, compact yet comprehensive (28 poems)
Maithili collection <i>Chitra</i> appeared in 1949 and became perhaps
the first modern classic and a standard university textbook in
the language. It is a microcosm with poems on the Mithila region
and Gandhi and the state-of-the-nation jostling with nature-
poems, nostalgia, love and social reform and commitment. Romantic
lyricism gradually surrenders to a resolute realism. The longest
(169 lines) poem of the collection, <i>Dwandwa</i> (The Duel Within), is
uniquely central to the understanding of the poet's painfully
chosen way of life and his awareness of the irrevocable, dynamic
dialectics of human history. It is uncannily like the testament
of a modern Buddha after the renunciation, vulnerable to
accusation of heartlessness, selfishness and escapism, yet
resolute and unapologetic in its larger decision.<p>

     If his first collection, in Maithili, was admittedly "an
album", <i>Yudhara</i>, the first one in Hindi, was "the Stream of the
Age." By 1953, the year of its publication, Nagarjun had long
freed himself of his <i>Meghaduta</i>-Kalidasa Sanskritic lyrical
romanticism, declared himself a human being and a proud athiest
and wrote on the leftist rebellion in Telangana, Eisenhower,
Mother India and famine. He saw Congressmen as sawdust-stuffed
scarecrows, lampooned Nehru for his "pro-captalist" policies and
discovered new poetic icons in Bharatendu Harishchandra and
Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala'. He is perhaps the only Hindi poet
who saw and wrote about the mighty Indus during one of his
wanderings in pre-Partition India. His 1O-line, 1950 poem about
"<i>the five worthy sons of Mother India</i>" is a piece of classic
satire, which he used to recite like a dancing Baul. The still
shorter, 8-line poem on "<i>The Famine and After</i>" remains a
masterpiece of tragedy and resurgence, hunger and satiety, gloom
and cheer, establishing him as a major talent in Hindi poetry.<p>

     Nobody seems to know and, characteristically, Nagarjun never
revealed why he took to novel-writing. But the memories of his
poor yet picturesque Mithila, the tradition-bound social and
family-life, his own household and his traumatic childhood,
adolescent rebellion, <i>lehre</i>-and -<i>Wanderjahre</i> and the experiences
during his variegated <i>Ausbildung </i>could not perhaps find space
enough even in his bi-lingual poetry and demanded expression in
creative prose. Added to this artistic urge must have been the
impact of the Bengali romantic-realist Saratchandra Chatterji
whom Nagarjun had translated into Hindi and the ultimate
compulsion--a novel still fetches much more money than several
poetry collections put together.<p>

     <i>Ratinath Ki Chachi</i> (Ratinath's Aunt)--the echo of
Saratchandra in the title unmistakable but there the resemblance
ends--was published in 1948. It is a novella running into 113
pages--Nagarjun never had the time, patience and ambition to write
a full-scale novel--but remains till date one of the most
realistic--and feminist--novels in Hindi. Uninhibitedly
autobiographical, the young protagonist, Ratinath, is none other
than Vaidyanath and the eponymous aunt is his hapless widowed
aunt who had to abort his father's illegitimate child, leading to
her social and spiritual ruin. Even Jainendra Kumar, the first
male feminist Hindi novelist, could not touch the stark, non-
prurient, deeply moving realism of Nagarjun's <i>Ratinath</i>. The theme
is still so taboo that the academic guardians of curricular
morality have firmly outlawed it from university syllabi. But the
novel is not only about adulterous carnality and foeticide, it is
a rich conjuring - up of Maithil society, culture and ecology,
interspersed with irony and humour so characteristic of the
region. That world of Mithila may not exist any more but in
<i>Ratinath Ki Chachi </i>lives forever.<p>

     <i>Balchanma</i> his second novella in Hindi, was published as a
book in 1952. This, again, is perhaps the first piece of fiction
of its kind in Hindi--a first-person account of the life of the
eponymous protagonist, a teenage backward Yadav bonded labourer.
A harrowing tale of abject poverty and naked exploitation, it
promises liberation to such rebellious youngster as Balchanma
only to end in his brutal murder by the mercenaries hired by the
upper-caste kulaks and landowners.<p>

     <i>Varun ke Bete</i> (The Sons of the Water-God Varuna), written in
1954 and published in 1956, is yet another unconventional work.
It is a story of the (low-caste) village fishermen fighting for
their fishing rights and trying to form a fishermen's
cooperative.<p>

     Nagarjun wrote 13 novels, 11 in Hindi and two in Maithili,
and each of them centres around a socio-economic-political theme,
making him one of the most 'programmatic' novelists in Indian
literature. His stories are invariably set in rural or semi-urban
Bihar and tell the story of the downtrodden and the exploited,
amongst them women and children. Quite
unselfconsciously, Nagarjun became the precursor of the so-called
<i>Annchalik Upanyas</i>--the Regional Novel--in Hindi, preceding <i>Maila
Annchal</i>, the path-breaking classic written by the fellow-
regional Phanishwarnath 'Renu' in 1954, by six years.<p>

     It is impossible to separate Nagarjun from Bihar--it
pervades his poetry and fiction and is indeed the nest to which
the aging falcon returned after each short or wide gyre. His
Hindi has just the right kind of Bihar flavour to it and his
poems are replete with the geography, culture and politics of
Bihar. This would be natural in his Maithil oeuvre but it is in
Hindi that Nagarjun introduces and establishes the people's Bihar
for the first time closely followed by 'Renu' and, later, by many
other younger talents. Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar,' Nagarjun's senior
from Bihar, was cast in a pan-Indian, high-culture, patriotic
mould and flattered himself with the sobriquet 'R<i>ashtrakavi</i>'--the
National Poet--but fellow-poets and millions of his admirers
affectionately called Nagarjun '<i>Janakavi'</i>--the People's Poet.
Though there are poems in which he remembers his wife and
children, poems of friendships and surrogate family ties, of
travel and nature, Nagarjun remains predominantly a poet of
politics and people, of the peasantry and of the proletariat. He
was angrier than any angry young poet but also possessed a
typically robust Maithil-Bihari sense of humour and savage
satire.<p>

     In his last published collection of Hindi poems <i>Apne Khet
mein...</i> (In My Own Field, 1997), he comes out with such personal
poems as <i>Na Sahi </i>(If Not So What) and <i>Aur Phir Dhikai Nahin Di</i>
(And She Was Not Seen Again) but also lampoons the Madhuri-crazy
M.F. Husain and the tall-talking Laloo Yadav. <i>Hua Gittiyon Men
Ras ka Sanchar</i> (Sap Ran Down the Ballast) is a harshly moving
poem on the de-humanized rickshaw pullers of Calcutta but in
ironically, Sanskritized language and metre, reestablishing him
as the committed '<i>il miglior fabbro</i>' of Indian poetry. But there
is nothing Poundian about him; he can be compared only to Walt
Whitman abroad and Kabir nearer home.<p>

     Though he was a card-holder decades ago, Nagarjun soon
realised that allegiance even to the Communist Party was a
curbing factor to a committed artist, whose first obligation was
to the people. Hair-splitting party diktats ill-suited his
leftist yet free spirit. He remained popular among all shades of
Communists, Socialists and even radical Congressmen.<p>

     The popular movement led by Jaiprakash Narayan so fired his
spirits in 1974 that he joined the "reaction-led" upsurge and was
jailed on 1 June 1975, before the Emergency was imposed by Indira
Gandhi, and was released only when a habeas corpus application
was moved in the Patna High Court on 26 March 1976. Interaction
with fellow-prisoners, especially those belonging to the RSS and
Jan Sangh, left him totally disillusioned with JP's proposed
"total revolution". He didn't stop writing anti-Indira poems, but
added anti JP-movement poems to them. He continued to embarrass
many of his admirers by such free-thinking volte-face. When he
accepted the Uttar Pradesh government's Bharat Bharati Award for
his literary contribution from Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in
1983, the smiles the two exchanged were full of mutual irony.<p>

     Much earlier, in 1968, he accepted the Sahitya Akademi award
for his collection of poems <i>Patraheer Nagna Gaachh</i> (The Leaf-
denuded Tree) in the newly-recognised language Maithili, largely
due to the friendly manipulations and persuasion by an old crony,
Prabhakar Machwe, who was then the deputy secretary administering
the prestigious awards in the August literary institution. This
deprived him of the Akademi Award in Hindi but Machwe knew that
with the kind of poems Nagarjun was writing in Hindi he stood no
chance of getting that in the near future.<p>

     This second collection in Maithili is not without its anti-
orthodoxy, anti-establishment barbs but it is certainly true that
after he discovered it as a vehicle of literary expression, it
was only to Hindi that he gave his creative and rebellious best.
Both in Maithili and Hindi he is better-known as a poet than a
novelist, though one can ignore his novels only at one's peril;
while at the national level he is more recognised as Hindi poet
than a Maithili one, but his assessment as a poet remains flawed
if his Maithili poems are ignored. He wrote in Sanskrit as well,
more as <i>Kavya-kautuk</i>, poetic sport, but his Bengali poems, far
less numerous than his Hindi-Maithili output, are significant all
the same and not merely for his amazing felicity in the language
but for their poetic content as well. There are some unique poems
in the Bengali-Hindi collection <i>Mein Militri Ka Burha Ghora</i> (I,
an Old Cavalry Horse, 1997) which are sensual, pensive, lyrical
and ironical--products of a strange burst of creativity in Bengali
during the 17 months between February 1978 and September 1979,
whose ultimate judge can only be a native Bengali reader of
poetry, though they sound extraordinary in Hindi translation.<p>

     For the last 30 years at least, Nagarjun has been the most
popular, loved and respected senior poet for the younger poets.
His moral and poetic influence is discernible in the works of
Kunwar Narain to Katyayani. Along with Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh
and Raghuvir Sahay, it is Nagarjun, older than the two, who
inspires the young poets in Hindi today the most; yet he remains
a difficult poet to emulate, for few can ever hope for his vast
experiences with people, his deep human sympathy, the deceptive
simplicity of his language and complete mastery over the poetic
craft. His output is awe-inspiring---6 poem-pamphlets and 14
collections in Hindi along with a pot-boiling textbook
<i>Khandakavya</i>, 2 poem-pamphlets, 2 collections and 2 bi-lingual
collections in Maithili and one bi-lingual collection of Bengali
poems. A small Sanskrit collection also lurks somewhere and
scores of poems lie scattered in periodicals and notebooks and
manuscripts.<p>

     During his travels spread over more than 60 years, Nagarjun
visited scores of places all over India and made thousands of
writer and non-writer friends. They became his surrogate family,
though he fathered six children in Tarauni, visiting his wife
from time to time. This long-suffering woman, Aparajita, who
really lived up to her name, the unvanquished, raised her
children single-handedly, educating them, getting them married
and settled in life while Nagarjun would intermittently appear as
an uninvolved guest--as a <i>Yatri </i>as he liked to call himself--with
some money and gifts only to re-embark on his journeys to distant
towns and cities where devoted, affectionate individuals and
families would greet him with the appellation "Baba", the
mendicant father-figure. Whether this was on account of his being
a Buddhist Monk--"Baba" being a natural suffix to "Naga"--or
whether it was attributed to his <i>sadhu</i>-like untrimmed beard and
greying hair, is not clear, but he soon came to be universally
accepted and addressed as a grand-father who united the family of
authors and non-literary families in shared, collective
affection.<p>

     Ironically, this has had a deleterious effect on his
reception as a poet. No major professionally-run publishing house
accepted his poetry before 1980, though he had made his
reputation as a poet much before that, and he is now not read and
respected as a poet but is loved and revered as "Baba'. Thus,
most of the 10 collections and the three volumes of his selected
works in Hindi, one bilingual Maithili- Hindi collection and the
sole bilingual Bengali-Hindi collection, all published after
1980, have gone largely unread and unreviewed.  While the
publishers are happy that the very name Nagarjun now sells, most
Hindi poets and critics hardly read him for he is already a
'modern classic' and a "Baba", the great parent-persona, beyond
all analysis and critical appraisal, fit only for sainthood,
deification and adoration. Everybody has a real or imaginary
personal reminiscence, anecdote or memory of "Baba", hardly
anyone has seen his recent collections. Those of his novels that
are easily available are largely neglected, which is something of
a pity, for Nagarjun, along with 'Nirala', Muktibodh and Raghuvir
Sahay, remains a poet whose significance seems to grow with each
passing day. <p>

     Bihar is India and India is Bihar and the poems of Nagarjun
mirror and critique the exasperating contradictions, daunting
challenges, perpetual tragedy and sundry triumphs of this
synonymous duality. His poetry and fiction are polyphonic; they
have more than one sub-text and can be read as subaltern
sociology and history but there is nothing subordinate about
them--they belong to the real, dominant mainstream of Hindi
literature. On the other hand, he is at core a vulnerable
individual, with love, yearning, guilt and tenderness, tormenting
and ennobling his soul. Its inner demons turned him into a
tireless traveller--he was no profligate philanderer. His widow
and children and thousands of admirers forgave him his
trespasses. To those who read him, he is a deeply committed
humanist with a rare mastery over language(s), style and craft.
Now that the canonised and mobbed "Baba" is gone, one hopes that
his devotees will turn to his works where he lives as the ever-
readable, relevant and breathless Nagarjun. <p>
