Pakistan, it has been famously remarked, although not by General Musharraf, is an
army in possession of a state. The burden of George Perkovich's absorbing and
often insightful study of our nuclear weapons programme, is that India is a
bureaucracy in possession of a civilization. As this summary might not convey all
that it might immediately, perhaps not even to the author, it might be best to
describe his opus in more detail!<p>

This is a study of India's nuclear energy and weapons program from 1947 to just
after the Shakti series of tests at Pokhran in 1998. Largely, it is an account of the
Department of Atomic Energy (DAE), the Defense Research and Development
Organization (DRDO), the officially sanctioned strategists clustered around the
Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis (IDSA) -- i.e. the "nuclear establishment"
and more generally the "strategic enclave" (his terms, which I shall use as well). </td>

As Perkovich is interested in understanding India's route to self-declared nuclear
weapon-state status, he pays considerable attention to the interaction of the
nuclear programme with many elements: the imperatives of the political leadership,
national security considerations, developments in Pakistan and China, and the
policies of the US and its allies. The starring role of the strategic enclave is not an
accident though: it is a chief contention of the book that India's nuclear weapons
program is primarily their doing and is largely independent of political and military
considerations or pressing external security threats. The book has a wealth of
material, a surprising amount from open sources -- which just goes to show how
hard it is to get the big picture when its ingredients dribble by one's consciousness
one day at a time. But the real payoff is in the material gathered in interviews
carried out by the author with the likes of Homi Sethna. P K. Iyengar, Raja
Ramanna, K. C. Pant, K. Subrahmanyam, K. Sundarji, Arun Singh -- today a
senior strategist in the BJP government whose florid prose suggests a natural
identification -- as well as several other senior figures who have chosen to remain
unidentified. The result is a rare portrait of decision-making in the government and
in the nuclear establishment as well as considerable insight into the personalities
involved -- all of which make the 582 pages of text and endnotes fly by quicker than
one might have guessed.<p>

A second source of new material are various archives in the US as well as
interviews with officials involved in setting policy towards India and I should also
commend the book for its account of American policymaking towards India's
nuclear program.<p>

The story Perkovich tells goes something like this. The nuclear energy program
began with the historical conjunction of a first class scientist, namely Homi
Bhabha, and a Prime Minister in love with "Science", namely Nehru, and their
common desire to accelerate the process of India's catching up with the West by
taking her directly to the frontiers of science and technology. As these appeared to
involve nuclear energy in 1947, nuclear energy it had to be. (In retrospect the

place to be was instead semiconductor research and the real milestone was the
invention of the transistor in 1948. Bhabha, the particle theorist, could not have
understood this -- yet another illustration of the silliness of governments, even when
advised by the best and the brightest, picking economic/technological "winners".)<p>

While the bulk of the effort was peaceful, if impractical in confusing cause and
effect in energy consumption, and directed towards the construction of reactors,
the book argues that both Nehru and Bhabha, especially the latter, were not
unaware of the weapons implications and that the early choices in the matter of
secrecy and of the crucial role of plutonium in the planned fuel cycle likely
involved an instinctive appreciation of the requirements of a weapons program.
<b>Certainly, to someone born after the Nehru/Bhabha years and accustomed to
hearing of India's relentless idealism in this period, it comes as a surprise to find
both gentlemen asserting periodically in the absence of a nuclear threat to India
that she was capable of building weapons in a year and a half but wasn't going to
do so.<p>

Oddly enough, it appears that this oft-repeated claim was false. India did not have
access to the necessary plutonium till the Trombay reprocessing facility began
operating in 1964. Perkovich argues that these were two sides of the same coin:
Bhabha and his successors in the nuclear establishment were unable to deliver on
the grand promises of cheap nuclear power and self-sufficiency, and in order to
justify their existence and budgets, needed increasingly to point to a weapons
program -- a pattern, he asserts, that continues to this day.</b><p>

The first of four turning points came with China's test of a fission device in 1964.
Bhabha pushed for an explosives program and Shastri, under pressure, 

acceded to research into "peaceful nuclear explosions" (PNEs) -- that were intended,
in the early days of nuclear power, to assist in massive engineering projects. The
book sees this as the setting of a new pattern -- a "stick-slip" routine in which the
nuclear establishment would push the weaponeering process further along while
the political 

position remained stationary ("stick) followed by a "slip" in which the country's
position would suddenly shift leading to a new equilibrium further along the
direction of overt nuclear capability. The second turning point was the first
Pokhran test in 1974 in which an explosives capability was made public with
serious injury to western assistance to the DAE's activities. The third was
Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear weapons in the 1980's which caused the weapons
issue to take on an urgency 

for the first time, and the fourth was the renewal of the NPT followed by the
negotiations over the CTBT which led into the tests undertaken by the Vajpayee
government.<p>

Progress along this route has not been uninterrupted; the book records three
instances of serious opposition: an initial attempt by Meghnad Saha to check
Bhabha's untrammeled power over the DAE and over most of the funding for
Indian science; Vikram Sarabhai's desire to stop the explosives program and
rationalize the priorities of the government's research effort and Morarji Desai's
unwillingness to even contemplate the logic of the first Pokhran test.<p>

Perkovich notes that no other nation has followed anything like as tortured and
restrained a path to nuclear weapons capability or with as much open, if largely
symbolic, debate. He also argues that actual security threats have played an
enabling but not decisive role in the progress of the program both on grounds of
chronology and of the absence of serious strategic discussions prior to any of the
major steps. Instead he argues that the push for the development of weapons and
delivery systems has come from two sources: (a) a general desire to possess the
symbols of great-powerdom and (b) the self-interest of the strategic enclave.
Restraining this but most importantly restraining deployment has been a quartet of
factors: (c) a general desire on the part of the Indian elite to position that nation on
a different moral plane than realists elsewhere (d) the exclusion of the military from
any meaningful input into broader national security decision-making with the
support of the strategic enclave (e) an unwillingness to spend what it takes to build
arsenals, again with the support of the strategic enclave and (f) international
pressure from the United States and its allies.<p>

The reader will note that with the exception of international pressure, all six factors
are either bureaucratic imperatives (b,d,e) or civilizational (a,c) or both (d,e). To
amplify: given a memory of being an alternative civilization (and not merely a
state) India cannot find its way to accepting the norms of the international state 

[<b>++Page 8</b>] 

system with its basis in realpolitik and yet cannot abide a situation in which she
does not possess the symbols of power that others, especially former colonial
powers, possess. The internal civilizational logic of caste and ritual hierarchy,
Perkovich suggests, is responsible for the dominance of the Brahmin civilians over
the non-Brahmin military and one might suggest, by extension, for the dominance
of development over deployment. The Nehruvian/bureaucratic state was designed
with the generalists of the IAS at its "commanding heights" and they have happily
kept the military under their thumbs (just get any army officer started on the
relative pay scales to get a sense of this!) certainly in part because of (in retrospect,
unjustified) fears of a <i>coup d'etat</i> in the early days of Indian independence. By
contrast the strategic enclave is a well established part of the 
Nehruvian/bureaucratic state on account of its ideological connection with its
<i>raison d'etre</i> and skilled at protecting its turf, and Perkovich argues that both they
and the generalists agree that to arm the military with nuclear weapons would be
to increase greatly the prestige and bargaining power of the latter relative to their
own. The only surprise in all of this is that the military did not figure this out in the
1960s and did not start demanding nuclear weapons back then! (I assume this is a
tribute to the capacity of the IAS to run rings around your average man in uniform.
The late General Sundarji was an exception but then, I gather, he was an Iyengar
himself!)<p>

Some of the central contentions of the book are captured well in two incidents. In
the first, Perkovich quotes K. Subrahmanyam in 1992 on the racial identity politics
he believes is a central motivation for Indian nuclear defiance, "What the world
needs is for blacks in America to become 51 percent of the population. Then you
will get rid of your nuclear weapons the next day, as South Africa has prepared to
do." The second is an account of an Indo-Sino-Pak-US dialogue co-organised by
the author in Goa m 1995 and attended by significant figures from all sides. Here is
Perkovich on the dynamics of the gathering:<p>

<blockquote>"Each group revealed tensions between the desire for its nation to be regarded as
"equal" to the others and the gnawing recognition of the actual disparities in
economic and military power ...The Pakistanis evinced a palpable feeling of their
state's inferiority vis-a-vis India and a desire to be regarded as equals to Indians
and India. The Indians displayed occasional haughtiness and even rudeness
towards Pakistani representatives but were diffident towards the Chinese ...In a
session on ballistic missile threats, the Indian participants raised no concerns over
China's missile capabilities vis-a-vis India, despite the fact that several of the
Indians wrote passionate articles in newspapers on the Chinese missile threat.
When an American asked the Chinese participants to address India's concerns, a
former high ranking Indian foreign affairs official interjected "China poses no
threat to India". This foreclosed discussion."<p>

A textbook study of <i>Homo Hierarchicus</i>?</blockquote><p>

I am stating the obvious, I think,

when I say that this is not a very flattering portrait of Indian nuclear
decision-making -- beset by colonial traumas, intellectual inadequacy, and
bureaucratic inertia. To a younger generation, increasingly disenchanted with the
colonial-dirigiste prism used by the <i>ancien regime</i>, much of this will seem
eminently plausible. One has only to read the nth piece pleading with the
Government of India not to cut off its nose to spite its face whenever international
trade negotiations come around to get a sense of the feelings of this group. A state
capable of strangling economic development in its domain for the better part of 50
years, is surely capable of lesser idiocies. But still, one has to ask, (a) is the portrait
accurate, (b) is it fair, and finally, (c) does it matter?<p>

On the accuracy issue, it is hard to argue with Perkovich's data, especially as he
has so much more of it than anyone else outside the strategic enclave! Starting
with the Indira years, he has interviewed many of the strategic enclave principals
and indirectly gathered evidence from some more. Their words speak for
themselves and do indeed tell of a decision-making process devoid of meaningful
national security inputs and of a `stickslip' pattern.<p>

My chief quibble with his account is its emphasis on the deliberations of the
strategic enclave and consequent failure to make more of three important markers
in the broader -- though elite -- Indian discourse on matters of national security. The
first of these is the 1962 conflict with China which is, to my mind, the childhood
trauma without which the behaviour of the adult (documented for example in the
Goa proceedings referred to above) makes little sense. The second of these is the
Deng reform and resulting economic growth in China and the resulting fear on the
part of the Indian elite that a superpower rivaling the United States was about to
develop on India's periphery. These two markers are not that far apart and the
legacy of one has surely fed into the response to the second. India and China are
natural peers, in size civilizational memory, and in their fumbling attempts to come

terms with a modern world created largely elsewhere. Certainly on the Indian side,
comparisons are ubiquitous and one can make a reasonable case that `respect' in
recent times has meant that seen as accorded to China.<p>

The third marker was Indira Gandhi's `left' turn in 1969 and the general
devaluation of institutions that resulted. The import of this was simply that serious
deliberation on nuclear matters became rapidly impossible outside the government
and its institutions like IDSA, a lack which is starting to be remedied now. To put
matters in perspective, in 1966 the Indian School of International Studies held the
first all-India seminar on nuclear matters that recommended a nuclear weapons
capability for India, and the debate on the NPT in 1968 took place in a Lok Sabha
with strong contingent of heavyweights on the opposition benches -- one can even
find in the debates the expressed, prophetic, fear that a Sino-US rapprochment was
on the cards! (Neither of these are drawn from the book and I am grateful 

to Professor M. L. Sondhi for bringing them to my attention.) Post-1969 and
especially after the 1971 election, both academia and Parliament largely ceased to
make meaningful inputs into governmental decision-making, contributing further to
the "inward" drift that Perkovich chronicles. Indeed, one can argue that the prior
Shastri period, with its more genuinely democratic polity, resulted in a fairly
rational response to China's acquisition of nuclear weapons -- the initiation of a
nuclear explosives research effort by India and that a less damaging internal
political development might have led to more considered moves on this front as
well. Instead, one got a largely subterranean bureaucratic poetics with occasional
eruptions to the surface -- which is the sort of geophysical activity that is very hard
to decode from its visible symbols.<p>

A second quibble is with the frequent references to India's poverty as a factor in
decision-making. First, by the 1970s it was no longer possible to argue that the
Indian state was primarily interested in alleviating poverty-the anemic 3.5% growth
rate was justified only by the imperatives of the

bureaucratic state and the kind of paralysis between conflicting groups described
for instance by Pranab Bardhan in his <i>The Political Economy Of Development In
India</i>. Hence the unwillingness to fund a serious nuclear weapons effort on the
grounds of `poverty alleviation' is best seen as part of the general unwillingness of
the `domestic empire' to share its resources with anyone else, not as a particularly
high minded move. (Watch what they do, not what they say.) Second, the Indian
state in the 1990s is much wealthier than it was in the 1960s even if the per capita
income of the average Indian is not-the purchasing power parity figures of the
World Bank put its expenditure at 15% of a GDP of about $1.6 trillion which
comes to about $240 billion dollars. For comparison the GDP of the US is
currently about $8 trillion but a more useful comparison might be to the US in the
1950s when it began building a nuclear arsenal with a GDP comparable to the
current Indian figure. Now this is, at best, food for thought, for a large correction
for the average economic and technological unsophistication (which would lead to
a different definition of purchasing parity) would be needed to make this more
realistic. But still, a wealthier state will seek to purchase more intangible goods
such as `security' and `prestige' in a higher consumption bracket -- China is seeking
to put a man on the moon, and it should not come as a surprise that India would
seriously revive its interest in nuclear weapons and delivery systems.<p>

While considerations of this kind would need to be included to provide a more
definitive account of the context of Indian nuclear decision-making, they do not
invalidate the bulk of Perkovich's account of what was directly in the minds of key
decision-makers as they took decisions. As I noted earlier, they speak for
themselves. So we must turn next to the question of fairness, namely are Indian
decision-makers being held to a higher standard than elsewhere in their failure to
provide a proper "security narrative"?<p>

To begin with, it is worth noting that nuclear policy concerns a category of
weapons that are, by common consent, expected never to be used and have indeed
not been used since World War II. As such there is really no empirical basis on
which to discuss rationally their place in the national security policy of any
country, as opposed to, say, the size of the conventional farces required to defend
its borders -- where historical data on force to space ratios can be used to arrive at a
reasonable figure. Unsurprisingly, the arsenals of the US and USSR in the heydays
of the Cold War went through the roof and attempts to theorise about the possible
employment of nuclear weapons spanned the range from Herman Kahn's
hyperspecific escalation ladder to Thomas Schelling's "a little lunacy is a good
thing" (something to keep in mind when the nuclear behaviour of the Pakistanis is
keeping you up late at night). Indeed even today, former Secretaries of Defense
James Schlesinger and Robert McNamara, neither lacking in serious analytic
ability, can scarcely agree on the role of nuclear weapons in the defense of the US
today. In such a setting, a "security narrative" has a large element of ambiguity --
mostly it speaks to the rhetoric of the relevant "strategic community", not 

[<b>++Page 9</b>] 

necessarily to the actual imperatives of nuclear defence/ deterrence. To make
matters more concrete, even in the case of the US, there is considerable evidence
that the dynamics of nuclear policy were seriously affected by the push from
weaponeers at Los Alamos and Livermore aided by competition among the
services for bigger pieces of the nuclear pie without a great deal of reference to
actual threats from the Soviet Union or China.<p>

Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai" align=right>

The interesting case is, of course, again that of China. The kinds of arguments
marshalled against a small Indian nuclear capability versus China, it would seem
have applied <i>mutatis mutandis</i> against China's acquisition of, what is still, a small
nuclear capability when measured against that of the US and of Russia. Until not
very long back China was not really capable of hitting the mainland United States
and even today it is hard to see how a Chinese leadership could, rationally, use
nuclear weapons in a conflict with the US, say over Taiwan given the
disproportionate retaliation that could provoke. In the early days it could readily
have been argued that China's nuclear program created more risks than it was
worth -- and in fact, it did nearly lead to a Soviet attack on her nuclear facilities
after the Ussuri River clashes in 1969 (see William Bundy's <i>A Tangled Web</i> for a
brief account of this event).<p>

It would seem that there are two conclusions one can draw from this kind of
comparative survey: (a) that any state seeking a small nuclear capability relative to
its potential adversaries is motivated primarily by prestige and is being silly -- this
would mean that India (versus China), China (versus the US), the UK and France
are wasting their time and money while the US, Russia, Israel, Pakistan, India
(versus Pakistan) and China (versus India) have some logic on their side or( b) that
even small nuclear forces with uncertain delivery means have a non-negligible
deterrent value in the minds of those charged with the use of force in inter-state
relations. In either case, it would seem that Indian decision-making about nuclear
weapons does display a "family resemblance" to decision-making elsewhere.<p>

(In fairness to Perkovich, he allows more or less this sentiment, sans China for
reasons that take up a footnote, in his concluding chapter.)<p>

If we grant (b), i.e. that nuclear weapons are "superb deterrents" (Mearsheimer)
one can even conclude that the Indian process has, in its predictably chaotic
fashion, arrived at something like a minimal reasonable result given its perceived
security needs. In other words, maybe the process didn't matter after all!<p>

I must say that this is not as easily dismissed as those of us addicted to greater
intellectual clarity would like. It isn't clear that a larger nuclear capability would
have helped given the rest of Indian history over the past 50 years or that complete
abstinence was ever plausible in a world where nuclear weapons are yet symbols of
military strength and with neighbours with strong reasons of their own to posses
them. So the quantum of nuclear deterrence that India has obtained is 

not obviously wrong. What is true is that a confusing process engenders confusion
elsewhere and promotes a reputation for hypocrisy. As Perkovich notes, when
India finally decided to seek overt nuclear status, it found itself acting against a
nearly unanimous international consensus in favour of the status quo and unable to
explain to an international community exactly why we sought this recognition.
Initially there was an attempt to produce a security narrative (Vajpayee's letter to
Clinton) but soon official noises retreated to the banal "due of one-sixth of
humanity" (the proliferation-non-proliferation thesis). Optimists can see in this a
struggle between a clearer definition of national self-interest that the BJP's political
tradition favours and the establishment whose cooperation it needs to govern.
Pessimists will note that even in the most optimistic of scenarios, several years will
be lost while Indian diplomacy attempts to undo the damage wrought by the initial
idiocies. There is a detectable shift in India's nuclear position post-Pokhran, most
notably in the "daft" (the pun is irresistible!) nuclear doctrine but with K.
Subrahmanyam, in a piece in <i>The Times of India</i>, October 4, 1999, defending its
ambition on the grounds that we cannot possibly afford to pay for it, I think the
golden age of Indian strategic clarity is not yet upon us!<p>

Perkovich himself is interested in the Indian experience for more global reasons, as
the Director of the Secure World Program at the W Alton Jones Foundation he is
in the business of funding attempts to reduce the danger of nuclear war. (The
Foundation's work in India includes support of the Institute of Peace and Conflict
Studies in New Delhi.) Appropriately, he concludes by outlining the lessons for the
non-proliferation regime supported 

by the five nuclear powers. He couches them negatively, in the form of four
"illusions in American international relations theory", namely (i) that security
concerns decisively determine proliferation, (ii) that non-proliferation is the
flip-side of proliferation, (iii) democracy promotes non-proliferation and (iv) that
equitable disarmament is unnecessary for non-proliferation. What is new and
interesting here are the last two and his assertion that they are connected.
American policymakers tend to point to South Africa, North Korea, South Korea,
Taiwan, Belarus, Kazhakastan, Ukraine, Argentina and Brazil as instances of
successful anti-proliferation policy to buttress their prescriptions for the rest of the
world. Perkovich notes that crucial decisions to abandon or halt a weapons
program in most of these cases were taken by non-democratic regimes, outside the
democratic setup (South Africa) or by nascent democracies repudiating their
military past (the last two). By contrast democratic members or near-members of
the nuclear club seem unable to do any such things presumably due their general
institutional inertia (can't undo anything in a mature democracy!) and a far greater
sensitivity to the perceived equity of international appearances (think France). In
Washington, where both democracy and non-proliferation are success words,
Perkovich's diagnosis of cognitive dissonance is likely to generate little sympathy
for a while to come. In New Delhi which generally tries not to make too much of
its commonalties with sister democracies in its rhetoric but doesn't like being
clubbed with (Pakistan) or below (China) its undemocratic neighbours, this link
could conceivably be turned into a normative argument for its possession of
nuclear weapons -- indeed, such an argument has recently 

been made at some length by M. L. Sondhi and Prakash Nanda in their recent book
<i>Vajpayee's Foreign Policy</i>.<p>

As the book has many interesting titbits, I can't resist mentioning a few.<p>

In the aftermath of the first Chinese nuclear test in 1964, two separate agencies in
the US considered providing nuclear assistance to India: the Atomic Energy
Commission suggested a "Plowshare (peaceful, i.e. for engineering purposes,
nuclear explosion) device while the Department of Defense suggested making
arrangements to provide a whole ring of states bordering China, including India,
with nuclear weapons in the event of Chinese aggression. These were ruled out
and the US ended up going the NPT route instead. Perkovich also adduces
evidence that Bhabha approached the US for a nuclear blueprint in 1964-65,
presumably without Shastri's authorisation, in an attempt to fashion a quick
response to China's test.<p>

In his 1974 visit following the first Pokhran test then Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger offered a dialogue on nuclear issues and offered to send US nuclear
experts to assist their Indian counterparts in safely managing a nuclear explosive
program that he assumed would follow in due course, inclusive of further tests.<p>

The canonical official number for the yield of Pokhran I is 13 kilotons, as quoted in
a September 1998 article by Sikka, Roy and Nair in <i>Current Science</i>. Perkovich
quotes Homi Sethna as saying that the yield was "much lower" and P K. Iyengar as
saying that it was between 8 and 10 kilotons. These admissions have the effect of
casting serious doubt on the official account of the yield of the tests -- as its defense
by Sikka <i>et al</i> was based on using the 13 kiloton number for calibration. The
upshot of all of this is, unfortunately, to call into serious question the claimed
successful test of a hydrogen bomb.<p>

Perkovich confirms that one of the small devices tested was made from
non-weapons grade plutonium. If this was a successful test of a device made from
something approaching reactor grade plutonium, the potential size of a fission
arsenal for India is far larger than previously estimated.<p>

All in all, this book is an impressive achievement, even more so if one keeps in
mind that Perkovich is not an India expert by trade. Although this leads to the
occasional fact that is not in place -- on occasion a somewhat inconsistent
rendering of Indian names, a flattering reference to Mrs. Soma Gandhi's
appearance that is worthy of the <i>New York Times</i>, perhaps a failure to see the
South Indian Brahmins as an internal Diaspora, and an account of Indian poetical
developments that insiders will want to amend in some places -- the broad account
rings true. One can only hope that it will challenge its international audience to a
more nuanced understanding of the road India took to Pokhran and its Indian
audience to a determination to arrive at a more deliberate roadmap for the
country's nuclear future. I highly recommend it to all interested in the potentially
perilous journey ahead. <p>
