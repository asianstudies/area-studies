This is what 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ss10.htm"><i>Subaltern Studies X</i></a>, as the
editors exclaim in their <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ss10p.htm">
Preface</a>, seeks to demonstrate.  The volume distances itself from the elitist
<center><table><tr><td valign=top>prejudices of those 
Left-radical positions which let many practices and ideas escape their critique
because they are comfortable with simply labelling and filing them away as bourgeois, feudal or
merely upper class. Such radical rejections, the volume shows, actually confirm the elitist claim
that there can exist such 'purely' elitist cultures and positions which are irrevocably distant and
always safe from the "presence and pressure" of the subaltern-effect. In contrast to such positions,
the <a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ssmap.htm">
<i>Subaltern Studies</i> Group</a> wishes to expand its own critical horizon, from which nothing
escapes, not even the most fortified and exclusive of elite existences.<p>

	The profound generality--that nothing is safe from the subaltern-effect--has the power of a
slogan, of a mobilising rationale, a rallying spirit which can pull together such different modes and
themes of history-writing as the essays of<i> Subaltern Studies X</i>. Individually, each contributor
asserts a distinct mood. It is this which gives the volume its strength as a whole--the fact that
multiple moods of history-writing could pervade a single and common slogan.</td>

	<b>Sudesh Mishra</b>'s prose--almost in the 'stream of consciousness' mode, without a
punctuating stop--charts the work of the memory of an indentured Indian emigrant to Fiji, a mix
of "history and hyperbole" as he calls it. Written in an intensely personal mood, making itself
opaque to easy readings and yet resisting the impulse to become too easily poetic, Mishra's prose
articulates with history through the individual's recognition of the impossibility of dying in pure
solitude and homelessness. For death, that ultimate ceasing of the world for the individual,
remains pointless until it is situated in the translating act between the dying and the living, the
passing and the remaining. Which is how Mishra's protagonist learns that "dying is an art like
living... learnt in the ripeness of time" and that he must recognise the world through the language
of the Other: "I began to live through all my senses.... because I began to discover what was
already discovered, to name things as they were already named..." .<p>


	<b>Kaushik Ghosh'</b>s remarkable essay, on the other hand, is written in the ironic mood. He
shows that the "primitive", far from being a relic of past centuries, was actually born in
colonial-modernity as a highly profitable "waste" produced by plantation capitalism. Marx's note
on 'primitive accumulation', Kaushik shows, can thus be made to denote, literally, the making of a
section of the world's population into "aborigines", into "primitive" labour, in fact much before the
"primitive" was discursively constructed by evolutionary anthropology in the 1860s. The
rhetorical power of this essay lies in the author's enunciation of the ironic sleight of
historicism-where the "primitive" becomes archaic and pre-modern precisely as s/he is produced
post capitalism.<p>


	<b>Indrani Chatterjee</b>'s essay on colour, gender and slavery, on its part, exudes the tragic
mood, as she describes the creation of a genealogically suspended community of 'half-castes',
rejected by both the colonizer and the colonized, through slave-concubinage and the use 
of slave-women's children as clerical and manual labour by the East India Company's military
establishment. She urges a rethinking of both the idea of family and the scope of slavery-studies,
in view of this dimension of early colonialism in India which created a coloured and labouring
community through the manipulation of "marriages" and "households". Interrogating the
conventional oppositions between kin and slave, between productive and domestic labour, Indrani
arrives at the difference that colonial law made in the terms of earlier modes of slave-holding. For
colonial law attributed to the slave a permanent jural marginality while insisting on her/his cultural
incorporation/emancipation through education and religion, thus disabling, tragically, the slave's
easy identity with even the colonized.<p>


	<b>Sundar Kaali</b>, on his part, borrows the hopeful mood from what he calls the
"not-for-a-moment silent" subaltern politics. In a beautiful essay that puts together early Indian
textual traditions, contemporary oral narratives and subtle political insights, he reckons with the
politics of spatialization in the context of south Indian villages, towns and temples. Crucial to his
essay is an understanding of the organisation of space not in a static or architectural mode, but
through the mode of processing and traversing, which transforms space from a Kantian <i>a priori</i> to
a political arena, where spatiality becomes both a practice and a metaphor and space stands for
both the scope and the goal of politics.<p>


	Also, <b>Ishita Banerjee Dube</b> discusses Mahima Dharma, a subaltern religious movement in
Orissa, and its mobilization and appropriation of the colonial legal apparatus in the construction of
the idea of an "authentic" religion.<p>


	<b>Vijay Prashad</b> questions the language and vision of India's freedom from the perspective of
Dalit politics, situated in the originary contradiction of bourgeois nationalism, the contradiction
between the impulse to erase the Dalit/subaltern identity and integrate with the Indian/Hindu
nation and the impulse to critique and subvert the nation from a Dalit standpoint.<p>


	<b>Christopher Pinney</b> explores whether 'magical realism' as an attitude towards reality is an
appropriate name for representational techniques used by the colonized, by painters like Ravi
Varma, to produce a reality which seemed both incredible and threatening to the colonizer; and
<b>Rosemary Sayigh</b> relocates Partha Chatterjee's theory of a rupture between the <i>problematique</i> and
<i>thematique</i> of nationalism to the Palestinian context, in order to explore the "troubled, asymmetric" 
relationship between nationalism and feminism.<p>


	That these essays are so very different from each other makes it clear, once again, that we
must approach the <i>Subaltern Studies</i> more as a project and a practice than as a school of
historiography. To miss this practical nature of the effort, as most critics of the <i>Subaltern Studies</i>
do, is to impute a 'school of thought' kind of unity, which is not only not claimed by the group but
which is also, to my mind, contrary to the spirit of the endeavour. The nature of the Preface
makes it clear that if one must look for a collectivity in the work of this volume, one must address
the slogan-like act of the Preface--the cryptic assertion that nothing is free from the
subaltern-effect. I use the term 'slogan' to imply a statement of collectivity, which appears in and
remains confined to the practice of coming together. It is a statement not to be proved once and
for all, but one that must be reiterated over and over again in one voice and in the course of the
act-in the recognition that the collectivity must be a product of immediate practice. For there, is,
after all, no idealized unity which is always already available.<p>


	Yet, however simple and easy this slogan might sound, however truistic and profound as a
generality it may appear, behind this utterance that nothing is safe from the subaltern-effect lay
more than a decade and a half of agonistic reckoning with history and history-writing. It began
with the <i>Subaltern Studies</i> charter, so to speak--particularly Ranajit Guha's preface to the first
volume and his <i>Elementary Aspects of Peasant Insurgency</i>--which argued against the use of class
categories as positivistic entities, which argued that domination is relational in principle, that both
rule and subjection appear as a theorization of each other. The most common debate in those days
was whether subaltern consciousness operated by snatching an autonomous field for itself, an
excess which dominant discourses could never hegemonize, or whether subaltern consciousness
worked primarily in reference to dominant discourses and acted as its negation, inversion and
appropriation. It soon seemed, however, that the problem with these terms of relationality was the
appearance of subalternity as necessarily a 'failure'. It appeared as if the consciousness of protest
and resistance was always already implicated in the terms of the dominant discourses themselves,
for inversion and negation had to depend on the continued existence of the dominant as the
necessary Other. Subaltern histories thus appeared most often as tragic, as stories of the failure
and of the self-alienation of the subaltern.<p>


	Gayatri Chakravarty Spivak and others, however, by the 
<a href="http://www.lib.virginia.edu/area-studies/subaltern/ss04.htm">
fourth volume</a> of the Subaltern
Studies, had turned this spectre of 'failure' around into a story of success. The very instances of
subaltern and contemporary use of dominant and past categories- which seemed like the
unfortunate complicity of subaltern consciousness in the existing rules of the game-now appeared
as the deconstructive effect of subalternity upon dominant discourses. It became proof of the
intrusive and subversive impact of the subaltern-effect that subalterns operated "from the inside,
borrowing all the strategic and economic resources of subversion from the old structures,
borrowing them structurally..." (Spivak,<i> Subaltern Studies: Deconstructing Historiography, SS
IV.</i> New Delhi, 1985), and thus rendering past relations of domination unconvincing by their very
own account. In other words, the acknowledgement of acts of deconstruction irrevocably showed
that the subalterns' use of dominant idioms and parameters was always a use with a difference. By
a temporally nego- [<b>++Page 18</b>] tiated and deferred 
harnessing of dominant discourses for its own purposes, the subaltern-effect
imploded the discourse from inside while at the same time de-authorizing the dominant uses
themselves. This was not complicity but an act of deconstruction.<p>

	Yet this sensitivity to difference--which no longer allowed the subaltern's use of dominant
categories of colonial modernity to be seen as simple complicity and defeat-still remained
inadequate and understated in Derridean deconstruction, at least in so far as post-colonial peoples
were concerned. For colonialism, exiled from the discipline of European philosophy and to a great
extent unproblematized by Derrida himself, was a politics of difference and sameness par
excellence. The idea of difference--between white and black, the colonizer and the colonized, the
nation and the world, the modern and the not-so-modern--here took on a potent and
power-ridden history. The assertion of difference as a reason to colonize and the assertion of
difference as a strategy for identity and freedom, the use of difference as a strategy for and as a
strategy against the imagination of the nation--senses of difference here, in the colonial context,
had of necessity to bear a political and practical weight in a manner in which the Derridean
difference-deferral idea was never compelled to. <i>Subaltern Studies</i>, therefore, moved on to the
project of enunciating difference in a way which went beyond the deconstructive project outlined
by Spivak earlier. Though Homi Bhaba himself has not written in any <i>Subaltern Studies</i> volume,
his idea of 'hybrid' histories has become popular with many of the authors precisely in this context.<p>


	Bhaba shows that it is in the emergence of interstices, rather than in the domains of
Otherness <i>a la</i> Edward Said, that the politics of difference is really played out. For what has
hitherto been written as the colonized's imitation. of the colonizing white man's image and
rationality (or the subaltern's internalization of the discourses of domination) has actually operated
in history as a mimicry and parody of this rationality. The hybridized existence of the colonized
and the subaltern annuls the claim of the colonizer and the dominant that a pure rationality can
exist by itself and provide an originary reason and authority to dominate. If in the deconstructive
strategy, the subject position (as that of the subaltern) appeared as merely a tactical, untheorizable
location-that propelled Gyan Pandey for instance to use a merely descriptive term like
"fragmentary" to denote the nature of history as reality, history as text and the historical subject as
an existent--Bhaba in a way intends to return the subaltern subject to history, but with difference.
This is a subaltern agency which "singularises the 'totality' of authority by suggesting that agency
requires a grounding, but it does not require a totalization of those grounds; it requires movement
and manoeuvre, but it does not require a temporality of continuity and accumulation; it requires
direction and contingent closure but no teleology and holism." (Bhaba, "The Postcolonial and the
Postmodern: the Question of Agency", in <i>The Location of Culture</i>, London and New York,
1994). The latest volume of <i>Subaltern Studies</i> shares in this transformed sense of the subaltern
subject. There no longer remains the dubious necessity for a pure and authentic subaltern position,
just as there no longer remains an original and uncontaminated dominant position which is not
subject to 'hybridization' by the subaltern-effect.<p>


	Clearly the issue, as it was earlier, is no longer whether the subaltern can save an
autonomous space for him/ herself, beyond the hegemonic reach of the dominant. Now what
works is the realisation that there can be no autonomous space <i>per se</i>, and certainly not a space
which is defended by the dominant as autonomous of and safe from the subaltern. One must
indeed recognise this as a radical and effective transformation of the terms of both history and
politics. Sudesh Mishra addresses the hybridized realm of the Indian migrant labourer inventing
the art of living and speaking in the land of his banishment so that "it was as if <i>machli</i> (fish in
Hindi) as a word and idea and culture had never existed prior to<i> ika</i>.... and yet the one was
forever inside the other". And Christopher Pinney calls the domain of 19th century Indian art, its
new "realist" techniques of representation and the industry of its commercial reproduction and
transformation as the "new hybrid space of magical realist mytho-politics".<p>


	I outline this trajectory--in which the subaltern-effect appeared to change from being that
of negation to that of deconstruction and then to that of hybridity-- in order to situate the latest
volume of the <i>Subaltern Studies</i>. For otherwise, many of the essays in the volume seem to give
the impression of being merely descriptive efforts, which seek to prove 'objectively' and inexorably
that subalternity is <i>both</i> radical and conservative, <i>both</i> resistant and 
complicitous--a conclusion which is perhaps too tautological to offer either a theoretical or 
a strategic edge to history and/or practices of political change. One is left 
terribly uneasy with self-descriptions like Ishita Banerjee
Dube's, when she claims to write her story as the "entangled histories of ,resistance' and
'incorporation'". Or with Vijay Prashad's description of his story as that of "ambiguity between
protest and integration". Even more theoretically informed pieces like Christopher Pinney's and
Sudesh Mishra's--though they do not attempt to list and add instances of protest and
incorporation, merits and demerits, as it were make 'hybridity' into a purely descriptive and
experiential category. Perhaps in empirical terms, that is not wrong. But as a description of reality
it may just as well be said that there is nothing which is not hybridized, that the search for the
pure, the originary and the uncontaminated is futile, that to claim certain realities to be hybrid and
others pure is to confirm the claim of hyperreal Europe, that its rationality, and none other, is the
original, authorial and therefore authentic one.<p>


	To my mind, the tension lies within the notion of hybridity itself. Bhaba's own use of the
term is susceptible to two interpretations. One, hybridity may be seen as a strategy developed by
the subaltern in his/her practice of reckoning with the dominant order. And two, at the same time,
hybridity may be seen as an empirical description of the subaltern's most plausible and usual mode
of existence. Historians, by habits instituted by their discipline, often tend to read Bhaba's
hybridity as the latter. And it is this reduction of the use of hybridity to empirical descriptions
which make hybridity into a profound generality in which the purpose of history-writing is lost, a
generality true for all realities at all times, at least in colonial societies. Perhaps it is necessary then
to dwell on the possibilities opened up by the former interpretation-the interpretation of hybridity
as a strategy Historians would have problems with this interpretation because the use of the term
strategy may imply a dependence on the analysis of intentions. After all, it is against the
over-emphasis on intentions that the discipline of history works, it is how history distinguishes
itself from becoming the biography of a nation or a society For the biographic insistence on
intentions creates an invincible subjectivity, which must in the last instance appear a-historical.<p>


	But let us move elsewhere, to an understanding of practice itself which does not need to
propose the practiceprocess dichotomy-practice being that which deals with the subject's
intentions and process being that which may render intentions irrelevant by the march of history.
One could, for instance, take one's clue from the statement made by Michel de Certeau in his <i>The
Practice of Everyday Life</i> (Berkeley, 1984)--that strategies offer a resistance to the movement of
time by the establishment of a place. Hybridity may perhaps be seen as Just such a strategy, a
mode of practice which established a space for being neither the (European) Self nor the
(indigenous) Other--which disrupts the time of historicism. After all, historicism, the ground for
colonial modernity, enunciates an evolutionary time where the pre-modern and the traditional, in
due course, transform themselves into the modern and the contemporary--often with the aid of
colonial education and commerce. Hybridity, however, exhibits before this over-determining
historicism, a space and form of existence which not only is neither 'modern' nor 'traditional',
neither 'advanced' nor 'backward' though it is tellingly contemporary--but which also disrupts the
historical, and the extra-historical, claims of both (futuristic) modernity and (revivalistic)
traditionalism. Hybridity, in other words, as a practice of living disputes the theoretical claims of
historicism itself.<p>

	If one puts such an interpretation to work in the name of Bhaba's 'hybridity', Kaushik
Ghosh and Sundar Kali become the crucial presences in <i>Subaltern Studies X</i>. 
Sundar Kali's essay--though he does not directly use the 
concept of hybridity and does not need to--foregrounds this
politics of spatialization. Better still, he does not write the history of the creation of a (hybrid)
space by subaltern politics. Rather, he writes of the "dialectics as he calls it, of the practice of
spatialization: "the politics of freezing and enclosing, on the one hand (by the dominant), and that
of fluiding and opening up, on the other (by the subaltern)." He even attributes to history of the
subaltern-effect must itself "spatialize". Perhaps what he means, or also means, is that
history-writing must itself make its own space and operate as a strategic practice. Kaushik Ghosh
provides the perfect supplement to this strategy of spatialization, when he unpacks the temporality
of historicism by exposing the absurd modernity of the being called the 'primitive' and the
pre-modern.<p>

	To reclaim subaltern historiography as a strategic practice, however, we must end up by
questioning the influence that Bhaba's idea of 'hybridity' seems to throw on the project. It is not
accidental that the earlier notions of negation and deconstruction--even though they might appear
to some as antagonistic acts--shared something with each other. They were both primarily
verb-forms. They denoted the subaltern-effect to be, and to be the product of, a kind of practice.
Hybridity on the other hand appears as primarily the noun-form of an adjective, making itself
prone to becoming a mere description of a certain inevitable reality, the proper name for a kind of
post-colonial existence, irrespective of practice. Apart from the fact that the usage "hybridity"
seems to smack of the memory of a pure original--a proposition already problematized by the
earlier phase of <i>Subaltern Studies</i> which took deconstruction seriously--hybridity falls short of
connoting a practice. And it is a practice which <i>Subaltern Studies</i> seeks to claim for itself as a
collective Project.<p>
