       As we move towards a new sophistication in our understanding of
Indian history, the complexity of our society acquires a novel
configuration. Indeed, not only does recent historical scholarship enrich
our understanding of the Indian past, it also becomes an active constituent
of the living present and an instrument of praxis towards a possible
future.

William Pinch's study of <b><i>Peasants and Monks in British India</i></b> 
is an excellent illustration of the potential of the new historiography as
richness in empirical detail and analytical depth are welded with a
sensitive understanding of both the material and social culture of the
popular classes.<p>

     In the opening sections of this scholarly book, Pinch spells out a
radically new picture of the subtle relationship between popular Hindu
religious Institutions and the rural classes during the recent centuries of
Indian history. We know that the institutions of high culture within the
Hindu fold were fairly well articulated structures since the first
millennium A.D., if not earlier. But we know little of the institutions of
popular religion in this period. When we turn to the medieval and modern
centuries, there is a substantial corpus of literature on the great
movements of <b><i>bhakti</i></b>, or devotional theism, which 
enriched the social and
spiritual fabric of the regional cultures of India, and continues to
dominate their cultural parameters. This literature has much to say about
the saintly figures who translated the high culture of Hinduism in the
languages of different regions, and through this initiative communicated
the seminal concepts of Hinduism to the common folk. Very little of <b><i>bhakti</i></b>
literature, however concerns itself with the institutions that the saintly
figures devised in order to give a firm underpinning to the spiritual
values they spread among the popular classes, in particular, among peasants
and artisans.<p>

     Pinch makes a pioneering attempt to rectify this situation by tracing
the trajectory of the Ramanandi denomination in the late medieval and
modern centuries. This denomination, it is widely believed, has played a
powerful role in shaping the social and spiritual climate of the populous
Ganga valley. The Ramanandi movement owes its origin to the seminal figure
of Ramanand, who lived in Varanasi in the 14th century, and drew around
himself a remarkable coterie of saintly figures like Tulsidas and Kabir
among others. The religious figures around Ramanand were in turn able to
reach out to different urban centres and rural settlements within the Ganga
valley. The message of devotional theism was thus carried to the artisan in
the city and the peasant in the village, binding in the process the popular
classes of North India through a profound sharing of social and spiritual
values.<p>

     While the <b><i>bhakti </i></b>tradition focussed on the remarkable figure of
Ramanand -- the most important among the saints who featured in the
devotional movement of North India -- the life story of this seminal figure
and the spiritual influences which shaped his worldview are a matter of
considerable contestation Some accounts suggest that he was a brahmin from
South India who originally drew spiritual sustenance from the great
Vaishnava saint Ramanuja. Others tell us that he migrated to the sacred
city of Varanasi to lay the foundations of bhakti in the Ganga valley, on a
truly "all-inclusive" basis, as part of a great design of social and
spiritual consolidation.<p>

     In tracing the subsequent history of the Ramanandi order in the 18th
and 19th centuries, Pinch locates a new meaning in the conflicting
traditions around the saintly Ramanand, arguing that these differing
accounts are related to crucial social and ideological questions: what were
the desirable castes and communities from which the sadhus of the Ramanandi
sect were to be recruited? Was induction to be confined to the upper
castes, or was a more open policy desirable? Further, what about the rank
and file? Were the lay followers of the Ramanandi order to be drawn from
those perched at the upper reaches of society? Or was the order to be
shaped as an "egalitarian" community, accepting recruitment from the high
and low castes alike?<p>

     Besides, there were sharp differences on the ideological content of
the Ramanandi order. These focussed, in particular, on the relationship
between the principles advocated by Ramanuja and those which informed the
life and work of Ramanand. Some Ramanandi figures looked upon their founder
as a disciple of Ramanuja, who had established a chapter devoted to his
mentor's teachings in Varanasi. Others portrayed him as a product of the
north Indian spiritual awakening of the 14th century, without any link with
bhakti in the South.<p>

     This portrayal of tension and contestation within the Ramanandi order
in the book under review, makes it clear that differences in the sect did
not merely amount to "esoteric" ideological warfare within a closed
monastic world. Instead, they concerned the openness, or otherwise, of the
movement in the matter of recruitment of sadhus; as well as the laity. The
ideological contestation within the Ramanandi church, there- fore, touched
not only on metaphysical questions, but raised pressing issues about the
sort of society that was to be created within the Hindu world. Were high
and low to be admitted alike to the charmed circle of spiritual fellowship?
Even more to the point, were the sadhus to draw the middle and lower castes
within their lay following as readily as they drew the social and landed
elites of the region? As we can see, these were questions of great social
import, and they reflect a crucial debate within a denominational world,
seriously seized of the social and spiritual questions affecting the wider
community.<p>

     In reviewing the history of the Ramanandi order in the recent
centuries, Pinch raises interesting questions about rural society, which
dwell as much upon political and economic aspects as upon ideological and
spiritual issues. The picture which emerges is one of a society in which
there was considerable circulation of organic intellectuals (in the
Gramscian sense) among the urban and rural classes. There is also evidence
of new trends in social and economic differentiation within rural society
in the colonial era, as a result of which the Ramanandi spiritual cadres
are confronted with pressing issues. in their bid to map out a trajectory
of spiritual welfare for their followers. It is interesting to note that
there is, at this juncture, little evidence of "communal conflict", as we
know it today, in the form of Hindu-Muslim confrontation. Instead, we
glimpse an increasingly differentiated Hindu society, in which the lower
and middle sections of the peasantry were pressing for higher social status
and spiritual salvation. This pressure obliged the leaders of the Ramanandi
order to take stock of the situation, partly to accommodate the aspirations
of their lay followers and partly to channelize these pressures in
directions in conformity with dominant trends in Vedantic philosophy. We
have, therefore, a firm location of grassroot religious
institutionalization, 'political' in the wider sense of the term, and
reacting sensitively to the material -- no less than the spiritual --
requirements of their constituents.<p>

     Predictably, the 20th century introduces a new era of contestation
within the Ramanandi 'church'. This is partly related to social and
economic trends -- more particularly, movements of peasant mobility and
their acquisition of newly acquired economic capacities -- in the first
half of the 20th<p>

century. These changes are caught in the wider framework of the 'freedom
struggle' within the country. Indeed, in popular religion, no less than in
popular politics, the post World War I years mark a new turning point in
the history of the Ramanandi Church. The time-honoured debate over who
could be admitted into the order acquired a new urgency; just as there was
renewed disputation on the desirability, or otherwise, of a truly popular
social base for the movement. A section of the initiated -- described as
"radical pandits" by Pinch -- sought with conspicuous success to transform
the ideological history of the sect, simultaneously as they tried to
fashion a new intellectual genealogy for the saintly Ramanand, as someone
who had no connection with the elite Vaishnava orientation of the great
Ramanuja.<p>

     To anyone familiar with the thrust of the Gandhian movement, which
swept across north India in the second quarter of the 20th century, this is
a familiar scenario. This period saw a sudden mushrooming of folk religious
preachers, or 'organic' intellectuals, who seek to guide the middle and
lower sections of urban and rural society, through the use of an idiom that
leaned heavily on the doctrinal message of the Ramanandi Church. One such
spiritual leader was the enigmatic Baba Ramchandra, about whom we have
substantial information drawn from the world of agrarian movements in the
middle decades of the 20th century.<p>

     I have dwelt at length upon the tenuous yet crucial relationship
between explorations in cultural and religious history, like Pinch's and
existing literature on the social and ideological trajectory of the
liberation struggle because of the seminal importance of this relationship
in shaping the material conditions and mentalities of the popular classes.
However, the seminality of this book reaches out beyond its formal temporal
span, to the contemporary scene, as we ponder over the future of the Ganga
valley, caught in a momentous struggle between the privileged and the
deprived classes.<p>

     The backward classes movement of our times, for instance, clearly
reflects in the second half of the century the social and the spiritual
turmoil which Pinch traces in the first half of the 20th century. It is
clear that the upwardly mobile backward classes locate for themselves a new
moral poise in the path held out to them by the Ramanandi radicalism
referred to earlier.  Small wonder, then, that the upper castes in North
India have rallied around the aggressive Hinduism reflected in the
worldview of the Vishva Hindu Parishad and the political agenda of the
Bharatiya Janata Party. In a society structured in the moral orders of
varna and jati, it should surprise none that this struggle between the
established and the newly arrived should articulate itself in a religious
idiom which sounds alien to liberal and radical alike.<p>

     In focussing upon the cultural antecedents of this conflict in the
recent past, Pinch has created a work of historical scholarship of rare
sensitivity and praxiological potential. I hope his book reaches out to
audiences far beyond the normal audience for such specialized studies.<p>
