Any good autobiography is intended as well as expectedto sensitise
readers to a number of issues related to the area of activity of the
respective author. It attains significance if the author succeeds in
recounting his experiences, in a coherent and conveying manner, enabling
the readers to draw a discerning conclusion. Personal actions and reactions
should have a resonation that is public in nature. <i>My Life: A Fragment</i> is
such an account which while focusing upon the political, social and cultural
aspects of life related to one of the eminent public figures of the early
20th-century India and, in general, Indian Islam, also opens up the
understanding of a lot many issues-be it the question of the formation of
identity of a community; be it the reflection on the changes brought out by
a colonial government; or a politician's response to theology, and above all,
the role of subjectivity in the arena of comparative study. </td>

<i>Islam: Kingdom of God</i> would have been the name of the present book
 had it got completed with its four volumes according to the original plan of
 Mohamed All. The notion behind this title was that God is the ruler and
 man is supposed to serve Him as His viceregent. Unfortunately, Mohamed
 All could complete only one of the four volumes and the second volume
 which he had started writing remained incomplete. This is the form of the
 book at our disposal earning its title <i>My Life: A Fragment</i> (which
 Mohamed Ali would not have even dreamt of) from Afzal Iqbal, the man
 who edited this book for the first time way back in January 1942. The
 original typescript (mostly destroyed during the holocaust of 1947 only
 two slim exercise books remain preserved in the library of Jamia Millia
 Islamia, Delhi) had been borrowed by Afzal Iqbal from Mohammad
 Mujeeb, the then <i>Shaikh-ul-Jamia</i> and Iqbal edited it when he was just an
 'undergrad' at the Government College, Lahore. It definitely presses upon
 the fact that had it not been edited and published by him at that time we
 would not have come across this book "the importance of which is
 enhanced by the absence of similar text written by any other leading actor
 of the period". Giving due credit to Afzal Iqbal who accepted that the work
 was far from being perfect and that supplementary footnotes had to be
 added here and there, Mushirul Hasan deserves appreciation for a befitting
 annotation and for undertaking the task of re-editing it with no alteration in
 meaning to the earlier printed text. The net result is the easy availability of
 the work today in a rejuvenated form rather than the limited access to it in
 the form of old prints in a few libraries. <p>
 
Before setting out to write his autobiography, Mohamed All, the man who
 added fuel to the anti-imperialist struggle of Mahatma Gandhi through the
 Khilafat mobilizations, had tried to compile a biography of the Prophet on
 the lines of the work done by Shibli Numani, a great scholar of Persian and
 Arabic. It was only after failing in this endeavour that he undertook the
 autobiographical effort. <i>My Life</i> has two parts: the first cart mainly deals
 with a detailed explanation of the author's religious antecedents and his
 attitude towards Islamic theology; and, the
 
second part which is incomplete and put in as an appendix sets out to
 explain the origin and growth of misunderstanding between Islam and the
 West. It could have proved to be `the real exposition, if completed. <p>
 
An added attraction of this newly edited volume is the Introduction written
 by Mushirul Hasan which is almost the exact reproduction of his
 contribution to <i>Islam: Communities and the Nation-Muslim Identities in
 South Asia and Beyond</i> (New Delhi, 
 
1998) edited by himself, and a summarised version of one of his earlier
 writings <i>Mohamed All: Ideology and Politics</i> (New Delhi, 1981). The
 Introduction gives the reader a general account of Mohamed All's life.
 Quite comprehensive in nature and content, it sets out to deal with the
 quest for identity in colonial India by this "controversial figure". Here, the
 editor tells us about the life and career of Mohamed All by touching upon
 his education and early occupations, his 
 
 [<b>++Page 31</b>] 
 
 tenure as a journalist, his turning against the Raj and adopting an anti-
 British stance, his internment, participation in the Khilafat Movement,
 interaction with Gandhi and other politicians, and a finally, an assessment
 of his qualities. <p>
 
Mohamed All starts with an apology that he is not an expert on religion
 and therefore he writes as `the-man-in-the-street' for 'the-man-in-the-street'
 but after reading the book one can really appreciate his uncanny grasp over
 the subject. Since he read the Quran for the first time in a complete and
 comprehending manner during his internment days, he laments that during
 his childhood he could only learn a few Quranic verses meant for the
 purpose of performing prayers, without any perceptible efforts. This, in his
 opinion, could have been avoided if he had belonged to a family
 specialising in religious learning; or if the Orientalists were also taught
 religion in the manner that he thinks people in the West are taught. But, at
 the same time, he upholds the importance of mosques and homes as places
 of religious learning as against clubs in the West. <p>
 
Talking about Aligarh, his alma mater, about which he was always
 nostalgic, he says that though it was an amalgam of the East and the West,
 it did not permit an orientation towards Eastern lore; in the name of
 'Theology' only a few elementary texts were taught. He, nevertheless, felt
 proud about it: "Our communal consciousness was, therefore, far more
 secular than religious..." His attraction to Shibli Numani at Aligarh was
 indelible and later he, in Jamia, even tried to copy his way of delivering
 lectures on theology. Assessing his entire educational background on the
 basis of the attainment of religious learning, Mohamed All says that he
 realised that after completing his course at Oxford that he had not even
 begun it. <p>
 
 After his return from Oxford, Mohamed All took up jobs at Rampur and
 Baroda but very soon switched over to journalism to be at the service of
 his community. He denied that it was at all a religious call; rather, it was
 about the secular affairs of his community. He launched the publication
 <i>Comrade</i> in English in order to arouse patriotism in his fellow Muslims. He
 considered himself as 'their (Mulsimss') spokesman'. In the same capacity,
 he took up the issues of European aggression over Turkey and talked
 about the alliance between the <i>ulama</i> and the Western-educated Muslims
 as an answer to Europe's ultimatum. But he is frank enough in
 acknowledging the selfish interests of the two. Also he shows how such
 things made him and his brother Shaukat Ali take shelter under 'Kalima-i-
 Tayyiba' or the `good word'. Focusing on the power of the Muslims as
 comrades, not as commanders, he cites the example of the formation of the
 "Servants of Kaaba" (1913) to unite Muslims of every sect. These attempts
 made it more than apparent his desire to formulate an identity of growing
 anti-imperialism and patriotism. <p>
 
A career as a journalist was not easy. Mohamed All writes about his
 problems as a journalist and encounters with the British Government. How
 the Press Act of 1910 put curbs on the freedom of expression and how his
 article "The Choice of the Turks" anti-British in content opened the
 door of internment for him and Shaukat Ali under the Defence of India
 Act. His other journal <i>Hamdard</i> was also forfeited, though it kept off the
 heat of advocacy Thereafter, he was interned and put at different places
 Mehrauli, Lansdowne and Chhindwara. <p>

During his internment, Mohamed Ali utilised his `forced leisure' to read the
 Quran for fully. The Quran cannot be a leisure reading as it has a
 "fragmentary fashion" -- each part of the Quran has a circumstance which
 supplies a relevance and a context. Each and every verse has a context. The
 reading of the Quran, however, gave him a new meaning in life. Mohamed
 All, at this point, expresses his urge to tell others what he himself had
 discovered -- a force of Truth -- and shows it also with quotations from the
 Gospels of Christianity. His entire analyses shows an in-depth insight of
 comparative religions and a grasp of the philosophical aspect of religious
 studies. <p>
 
To show, again, his love for the Quran and Islam, Mohamed Ali discusses
 two European writers -- M. Renan and H.G. Wells who were not Muslims
 but were neither professing Christians. Taking them as examples, he tried
 to make others understand the firmness of his faith as he found it in "the
 never-fading freshness of the Quran" as against these philosophers who
 criticised Christianity -- their own religion. He also felt that what Europe
 knows as Christianity is not the teaching of Jesus but the stories told by the
 apostles. He deals with -- often pointedly showing faults -- the history and
 story of doctrination in Christianity. The coming of Islam into contact with
 the Greek philosophy is seen as the growth of Muslim scholasticism
 whereas the Hellenistic graft is seen by him as something which changed
 Christianity out of recognition from its original form. Mohamed Ali
 vehemently takes issue with Christianity and Christendom and even goes to
 the extent of asserting that "Christianity as a living faith is on the wane". <p>
 
This whole issue of Islam versus Christianity can be discussed in the light
 of the latest on-going debate. In a recently published article "Islam, The
 West, and the World" (<i>Journal of Islamic Studies</i>, Oxford, May 1999)
 Immanuel Wallerstein poses the question as to why the Christian world
 seems to single out the Islamic world as its particular demon ever since the
 very emergence of Islam. And the same can also be said regarding Islam
 vis-a-vis Christianity. Samuel Huntington sees the `Christian' West and
 Islam as two antithetical `civilizations'. For the moment, it can be said that
 though Mohamed Ali tried to draw a comparison between the two -- while
 endorsing his own religion -- he also expresses his belief elsewhere 
 
that "all religion is intended by the Divine Being" and regards Jesus as
 "one of the Prophets of Israel". On another occasion he also hails Islamic
 tolerance as a fact of history. <p>
 
It is not that Mohamed Ali sees only uniformity in Islam. He does write
 about the Shia-Sunni divide and clashes; the Persian incursion in the arena
 of power; and the four mutually contending schools of law. However, he
 holds that the main division in Islam is more political than theological. He
 also highlights the importance of <i>aql </i>or reasoning in the Islamic theology
 along with <i>naql </i>or tradition and <i>kashf </i>or the intuitive insight granted to the
 mystic in his ecstasy. He holds philosophers and fools as equals before God
 and the Quran which he considers to be "everyman's book" intelligible to
 both. And all this he says without being an 'authority on Islam'! <p>
 
The second and incomplete part of the work which he claims to be "the
 heart of my subject" sets out to trace a "brief" and "adequate" history of
 the misunderstanding that exists between Islam and the West. Again, as
 before, be challenges the originality of the Gospels written by "the Galilean
 apostles who had been companions of Jesus during his ministry". He
 discusses at length the inner dynamism of the Christian Church, with a
 detailed note on various groups of gnostic heretics. He also shows the
 origin of different creeds and divergence of opinions on prominent issues
 like the Trinity. He mentions how different Christian emperors -- 
 Constantine, Valens and Theodosius -- made attempts to bring about
 uniformity for which they even resorted to persecution. He shows how the
 establishment of religion superseded the exercise of reason. By contrast, he
 stresses on how Islam served as a tolerant creed. In fact, instead of finding
 the causes of misunderstanding, this section more than demonstrates the
 misunderstanding itself.Perhaps the author would have dealt with it later
 had this part of hte book got completed in its intended form, and then the
 on-going debate on Islam and Christianity pitted against one another would
 have found a conclusion.<p>
  
 Mohamed Ali's autobiography, though mostly religio-philosophical in
 nature, does touch upon the question of `Muslim identity' vis-a-vis the
 colonial government and the West. <i>My Life</i> is a major statement of how a
 Muslim finds himself placed amid differing ideologies. It gives the reader an
 insight into the Muslim thinking, the place religion has in his/her life and
 the Muslims own role in different spheres of life, particularly at the levels
 of society and nation. The book, no doubt, would have given a more
 comprehensive picture had it been completed, but even in its present form,
 on can draw historical inferences. <p>
  
 Though the book is generally free from major mistakes, the few errors that
 one does find are serious. For example, the year of Syed Ahmad Khan's
 (1817-1898) passing away is given to be 1889 in the Preface. One also fails
 to understand the repetition of a particular verse in the Introduction and
 that too with two varying citations. The book, otherwise, is insightful
 reading for anyone interested in history, philosophy, religion, sociology and
 politics. <p>
