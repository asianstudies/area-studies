In an article published in 1996 in the journal <i>Environment and History</i>, Donald
Worster describes environmental history as a doorway through the wall that
separates nature from culture. Nevertheless, too often nature -- the largest, most
complex pari of the material world we live in -- has been relegated to the background
in historical studies. Chetan Singh's <i>Natural Premises </i>brings home the point that
this wall is indeed permeable. Following the <i>Annales</i> school, and very much
influenced by Fernand Braudel, Singh emphasizes the inextricable link between
geography and history.

There have been several significant historical works on the environment in the past
decade. However, much of the scholarship has concerned itself with
policy-making, the ideology behind the making of such policies, and their
inevitable impact on local communities. Some of the recent work has moved away
from the simplistic state-society dichotomy, and has disaggregated it within the
context of the environment at large. Such works have revealed not only the
multilayered nature of both state and society, but also the divisions within the state
and its shifting stance with regard to its objectives on specific issues.</td>

<i>Natural Premises</i> is important for two 
reasons. First, by adopting the <i>longue dureï¿½</i>
approach, Singh brings alive a robust society which was in existence much before
the arrival of the British, and which, to a considerable extent, flourished during the
colonial period as well. He lays down his argument in the familiar dialectic of
change and continuity. He places emphasis on social and ecological elements that
represent continuity in order to address long-term changes in the relationship
between environment, economy and society. In this respect, Singh does not take
the British period as the benchmark. Second, in detailing the ecological diversity of
the Himalayan region known as Himachal, he argues for the interconnected nature
of the sub-region rather than its separateness. Geographical diversities compelled
society to build an economy which thrived on regular transactions at different
levels.

<p>At the outset, Singh deals with issues of environment, territoriality and the state.
While geography contributed to the delineation of boundaries between states -- the
borders of states were usually defined by high mountain ridges, unfordable rivers
or fast flowing mountain streams -- the argument of a "natural frontier" was also
commonly used as an excuse for political expansion. The state, itself, was not
uniform in the Himalayan region, but varied from centralized political entities in
river valleys to small chieftainships in the higher ranges. Forests, pastures, and the
agrarian economy of river valleys provided valuable resources for all such states.

<p>Singh discusses the interaction between society and environment, detailing the
carefully regulated balance of resource use in the mountain economy.
Landholdings varied according to environmental zones and the proprietory rights
of cultivators to the soil was based on the service provided by the holder of the
local ruler.  In other words, control over land was used to establish authority over
people. Land was categorized by the availability of water, and its classification for
revenue purposes was quite complex. Agriculture was largely subsistence-oriented.
Maize, barley, wheat cereals, pulses and vegetables were the principal products
although "cash crops" such as tobacco, poppy and hemp were also grown for the
market. Without 'sanitizing' the internal dynamics of society at large, Singh
delineates the simple social stratification, the flexibility of the caste system in
western Himachal (inasmuch as Brahmins and Rajputs cultivated the land they
owned), the assertive nature of the peasantry, and the social mobility of the artisan
and lower castes.

<p>The pastoral economy was also vibrant and largely trade-oriented. As pastoralists,
various groups like the Gaddis and Gujjars, projected a distinct social identity
which enabled them to interact more effectively with the state and settled society.
Both these groups exercized their grazing rights on pastures and forest areas, and
paid their taxes to local kings.

<p>In highlighting the ecological diversity of the region, Singh argues for overlapping
economic rationalities and extended economic considerations in the realm of
markets -- domestic and international. There was regular trade in food grains, cattle
for meat, milch and dairy use, and wool. Trade in wool bound the region internally
and linked it to the international markets as well. The region also depended on the
plains for commodities like salt, cotton, and sugar. The absence of money in
neighbourhood trade, as opposed to its presence in long-distance trade, suggests
the relatively slow penetration of money economy into the hill states.

<p>This detailed contextualization of the region not only provides an empirically rich
history of the period, but also cautions the reader about attributing change solely
to the British. Without underscoring the point that the colonial period was a
watershed in the history of the Western Himalayan region, Singh explains how the
establishment of colonial rule altered many things, including socially defined
notions of wealth. In the context of a highly developed market that transcended
village-based agrarian rationality, forests now came to represent wealth in an
unprecedented way. This led to the reorganization of regulations in which forest
rights came to be indexed by colonial law. The nature and scale of human
intervention began to change the basic characteristics of the regions' forests. More
significantly, conservation and forestry were no longer seen in opposition to each
other, but were systematically interlinked. The scale and speed of the
commodification of timber marked the beginning of a process that undermined the
multifaceted resource base of the region.

<p>By declaring themselves the legitimate successors of local kings, the British
claimed their privileges and authority in the region. They altered land-holding
rights by emphasizing a proprietory claim of the peasantry on the soil, especially in
areas closer to the plains. Within two decades (1870-1890), more than one-sixth of
the land had been alienated. New crops such as potato not only opened up new
areas to intensive cultivation, but also replaced clearings near pastures that were
earlier used primarily for penning sheep.  In the same vein, colonial administrators
attempted to reduce grazing land and restrict the mobility of grazers.

<p>Since the agrarian economy necessitated a combination of livestock farming (cattle
or sheep, depending on the region) and the cultivation of food crops, local
communities were greatly dependent on the 'intermediate spaces' (between forests
and cultivated land) that the British were to soon label as 'wastes'. Singh
undermines earlier opinions about these 'wastelands' as common property
resources. In fact, these lands were granted to individual beneficiaries for
supplementary use of grass and water supply. Singh suggests that the emergence
of a market beyond the village economy and the escalating need for additional
resources would have changed the attitude of the peasantry towards the 'wastes'
irrespective of whether new rules were introduced by colonial administrators
or-not. He clearly contests the view of commoditization as a neat process closely
controlled by agents of capitalism and the colonial state. just as the impact of
colonial policies varied with the sub-regions, the social response was equally
diverse. The absence of a defined village community in western Himachal explains
why peasants in the Kulu region responded less vociferously to regulations
concerning 'wastelands' and forest regulations than those in the Kangra region.

<p>The book leaves some questions unanswered and a few issues unaddressed. Singh
does not sufficiently address the nature of the conflict over perceptions of the
environment in general, and over access to use of resources, in particular. The
market is defined as an activity, and yet the people who operate in it and around it,
especially during British rule, remain faceless. The institutional basis of resource
use and the disaggregated nature of the state appear to have been overlooked. We
know that the state was neither monolithic, nor a perfect, transparent entity with
a coherent logic of only revenue collection.

<p>But then, Singh's book is about the life of the peasant in the Western Himalayan
region, a peasant who escapes the distortions of colonial categorization. Many of
these issues emerge because the author deals with broad-sweeping changes in the
region, based solely on governmental printed records -- Gazetteers, Settlement
Reports, and the Punjab Hill States Agency Records. The importance of this work
lies in the author's recognition of the variety in the landscape, and of the equally
complex life in the region without falling into the "abyss of environmental
determinism". As Singh says at the very outset, the natural premises provided both
the spatial context within which the peasant lived, and the logical assumptions
upon which he based his actions.

<p><i>Natural Premises</i> is well-written and will be valuable for both historians and
readers interested. in environmental issues. This is the author's second major work;
his first book, <i>Region and Empire: Panjab in the Seventeenth Century</i>, traced the
evolution of society and economy in Panjab during the 17th century. Perhaps his
next book will bring the story of the Western Himalayan region up to present.
