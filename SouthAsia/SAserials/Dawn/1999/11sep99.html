<a name="deci">Decision on CTBT linked to removal of sanctions: FM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------    

ISLAMABAD, Sept 8: Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said Pakistan was 
mulling over its final decision on the Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty because US Congressional action on the removal of sanctions 
against Islamabad was still pending.
    
Pakistan is "making an assessment what the US Congress is going to 
decide," Mr. Aziz told reporters.-APP

<a name="newd">New Delhi�s N-doctrine threatens global peace</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Sept 7: Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmad urged the 
international community to "fully comprehend" the near and long-
term strategic implications of India�s proposed nuclear doctrine.
    
He said India�s nuclear ambitions are aimed at creating a nuclear 
triad  - employing up to 400 nuclear warheads on land, sea and in 
air - at a cost estimated by independent experts as anywhere 
between 20 billion dollars and hundreds of billions of dollars.
    
The foreign secretary rejected the assertion that such a formidable 
nuclear arsenal justified the Indian claim of building only "a 
minimum nuclear deterrence", and declared that coupled with its 
ever-burgeoning conventional military forces, New Delhi aimed at 
building "an offensive and not a defensive military capability".
    
He recalled that Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh had himself 
asserted that a credible minimum deterrence was "a dynamic concept 
and not fixed in time and space."
    
Apparently sounding alarm bells just about two weeks before the 
opening of the UN General Assembly session which is to focus on the 
nuclear issue, including the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). 
Mr Ahmad, in response to a post-talk question, said that the Kargil 
crisis and the subsequent announcement of the Indian draft nuclear 
doctrine, presented "an entirely changed environment which would 
have a direct bearing on Pakistan�s earlier decision to de-link its 
position on the CTBT from India�s.

<a name="sart">Sartaj to take up Indian nuke-plan issue at UN</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Sept 7: Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz is leaving for New 
York on Sept 19, to address the UN General Assembly where he is 
expected to focus on India�s draft nuclear doctrine and its 
implications for the region and the world.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who was earlier scheduled to take the 
trip for the purpose on 17th, has reportedly decided to stay home 
in view of the growing street agitation against the CTBT and the 
Washington accord.
    
Official sources have, however, refused to confirm or deny the 
reports of the PM�s decision not to go to New York as scheduled.

<a name="indi">India not willing to receive troops: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 8: Pakistan said that India was showing reluctance 
to receive its two soldiers, captured by the Pakistan army 
recently, to cover up its attacks on Pakistan�s posts on the Line 
of Control.
    
The Indian government is showing no sign of willingness to take 
back two of its soldiers which were captured by the Pakistan army 
during an Indian attack on a Pakistani post in Shyok-Turtok sector 
across the LoC in Kashmir on 30th August, 1999, a foreign office 
press release said. "This obviously is an attempt to cover up 
attacks by the Indian army on Pakistani posts," the FO said, adding 
"by itself causing delay in receiving its soldiers, New Delhi hoped 
to mount a propaganda against Pakistan."
    
On Sept 3, Pakistan had announced its decision to release the 
soldiers through the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC). 
The Indian media reports suggested that New Delhi was also 
reluctant to receive the soldiers through the ICRC. On the other 
hand, Pakistan insisted that the ICRC must be involved in this 
process to avoid India�s malicious and propagandistic charges of 
maltreatment of its soldiers, the FO said.
    
Pakistan had earlier returned bodies of eight Indian soldiers 
killed in the Kargil sector, directly to the Indian authorities as 
a gesture of goodwill. The Indians, however, had leveled 
allegations of mutilation of the bodies, which were subsequently 
not substantiated by the postmortem reports. The Indian media, too, 
had exposed the blatant Indian government lie.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 9: Pakistan expressed its willingness to accept 
Britain�s proposals to strengthen the UNMOGIP observers along the 
Line of Control to monitor LoC violations and infiltrations and the 
stationing of independent observers in the occupied Kashmir for 
greater transparency in human rights matters.
    
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz conveyed this willingness of Pakistan 
while talking to a British parliamentary delegation on a fact-
finding mission to AJK which met him at the foreign ministry here.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz to decide about New York visit: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Sept 9: The Foreign Office has made "appropriate" and 
"necessary preparations" for the prime minister�s address to the UN 
General Assembly on Sept 22, but a "final decision" about his visit 
to New York is still awaited, FO spokesman Tariq Altaf said.
    
Questioned repeatedly about Mian Nawaz Sharif�s visit, Mr Altaf 
said at his weekly news briefing that it was for the Prime Minister 
to decide whether or not to undertake the visit. He, however, said 
that it should cause no problems if the Prime Minister delayed his 
decision for awhile.
    
The spokesman evaded direct answers to most of the reporters 
seeking to know what was delaying an official announcement in this 
regard. The decision might be known any moment, he said.
    
Mr. Altaf disclosed that it would be an "official" and not the 
Prime Minister who would sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, in 
case Islamabad decided to do so. He did not elaborate who that 
official might be. He was pressed by newsmen to react to a 
suggestion that it was the dilemma over the signing of the CTBT 
which was possibly delaying the prime minister�s decision about the 
visit.

<a name="gran">Grand alliance in offing </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, Sept 6: Political developments have fast moved towards a 
'grand' alliance and formal announcement of major parties joining 
hands for a joint struggle to oust the PML.

To begin with the alliance will have in its folds the 14-party 
Pakistan Awami Ittehad of which the People's Party is the largest 
organization, the Awami National Party, the Muttahida Qaumi 
Movement, the Pakistan Awami Tehrik of Allama Tahirul Qadri and the 
Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf headed by cricketer-turned-politician Imran 
Khan. Talks with other political parties like are also said to have 
been progressing and leaders here hope "a positive outcome".

The alliance has determined seeking the dismissal of the Nawaz 
Sharif government as its "top priority" and sources close to it say 
that this is the avowed objective. However, the alliance is said to 
have worked out a future agenda which has "a genuine" provincial 
autonomy and devolution of power on top.

The PAI leadership has not invited the Jamaat-i-Islami and the 
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam of Maulana Fazlur Rehman to join the alliance 
for different reasons.

<a name="pppw">PPP welcomes formation of joint opposition</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 8: The Pakistan People�s Party has welcomed the 
formation of the joint opposition and considers it a vindication of 
the position taken by Ms Benazir Bhutto and the party for the last 
two and a half year that Nawaz Sharif and the Federation cannot co-
exist.
    
The Pakistan People�s Party is also confident that the joint 
opposition will be able to rid the country of this regime in the 
near future. Senator Raza Rabbani said that the PPP had since the 
inception of the regime, maintained that its policies were 
detrimental to the interest of the smaller federating units and as 
a consequence a threat to the federation of Pakistan.
    
Mr. Rabbani said that the PPP had continuously maintained that the 
policies of loot, plunder, rescheduling of bank loans, non recovery 
of outstanding taxes from the vested interests had led to a stage 
where the finance bill of 1999-2000 passed by National Assembly had 
become redundant.

KARACHI, Sept 10: At least 25 people were arrested in a police raid 
on the Muttahida Qaumi Movement�s headquarters "90" and other 
offices at Azizabad.
    
According to Senator Aftab Sheikh, the policemen who reached the 
place in at least nine mobiles thoroughly searched the offices and

the party had prepared for the opposition�s rally scheduled to be 
held today.
    
He said the police arrested a number of people and took away fax 
and printing machines, besides causing damage to the property. 
Those picked up included employees of the head office and the KKF.
    
"I do not remember that all of those picked up were MQM men. Some 
of them might be of other parties from the alliance," said the 
senator. Condemning the police action, he said that the raid had 
been conducted to create panic and harassment in a bid to prevent 
people from attending the rally. He said the police were headed by 
SHO Ghazanfar Kazmi and the DSP of Nazimabad, Chaudhry Mohammad 
Aslam.

"Come what may, we will hold the rally at the scheduled place and 
if the administration created obstructions and denied the 
opposition of its basic democratic right of expressing dissent in a 
peaceful manner, all responsibilities for the consequences will 
rest on the administration," they said.

QUETTA, Sept 9: The Awami National Party formally parted ways with 
the Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement (PONAM) here. This was 
formally disclosed by Dr Inayatullah Khan, Secretary-General of the 
Awami National.
    
He said that the PONAM Convener, Senator Ajmal Khan Khattak, had a 
formal meeting with the other components of PONAM informing them 
that the ANP could not continue its association with other PONAM 
parties for "basic differences on political and constitutional 
issues."
    
Dr Inayatullah explained his party�s position saying that ANP 
believed in politics of Federation while the PONAM components were 
insisting on confederation. He said that ANP wanted further 
improvement in the existing constitutional arrangements granting 
more and more autonomy to the federating units while the PONAM 
parties were basically opposed to federal parliamentary system and 
they were demanding confederal powers which was against the ANP 
principles.

LAHORE, Sept 10: Estranged PML MNA Mian Azhar says he is not 
working for an interim set-up but is trying to rectify the party 
situation.
    
Talking to reporters and various delegations which called on him, 
he said he wanted that the party manifesto should be implemented in 
letter and spirit. "Don�t push me to the opposition camp".
    
The former governor assailed the performance of the government, 
saying the Quaid-i-Azam had won independence but the government had 
again made the nation a slave of foreign countries and 
institutions.
    
He said it was strange that the government held talks with the 
United States and India but was reluctant to consult opposition 
parties. He underlined the need for national consultation for 
better decision-making process. Answering a question, Mian Azhar 
said so far the Sharifs had made no effort for conciliation with 
him. However, he reiterated that there was no chance of a patch-up.

Staff Correspondent

DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Sept 8: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam chief Maulana Fazlur 
Rehman has warned the governments of the US and Pakistan to 
withdraw American commandos from Peshawar and tribal areas or "face 
the consequences".
    
Addressing a press conference at his residence, the maulana claimed 
that the government was providing all the assistance to the 
commandos to hunt Osama bin Laden and added that the commandos were 
using Pakistan�s land for their evil designs against Taliban and 
bin Laden.
    
The JUI chief advised the government to ensure the evacuation of 
the commandos before the tribal youths take the matter in their own 
hands and deal with the commandos according to their own customs. 
He further warned that if the matter was not dealt with accordingly 
the two governments would be held responsible for any "untoward 
situation".
    
The maulana said people would never allow anyone to use Pakistan 
lands against Afghanistan. He said that if the US forces attacked 
Afghanistan, then no American in Pakistan would be safe and added 
that by sending commandos in 

tribal areas and Afghanistan, the US government itself was putting 
the lives of those Americans at stake.

<a name="fail">Pakistan fails to report Y2K air-readiness to ICAO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Omar R Quraishi

LAHORE, Sept 10: Pakistan has failed to tell the International 
Civil Aviation Organization whether its air traffic control system 
will be Y2K-compliant by Dec 31, 1999, when the so-called 
�millennium bug� is expected to hit computers all over the world.
    
The UN-based group that sets international aviation standards and 
guidelines had asked all its 185 member countries to report by July 
1, 1999, whether their air traffic and control systems would be 
able to deal with the Y2K problem. A Civil Aviation Authority 
official, when asked about this, said that the authority would 
�soon� send a communication to the ICAO.
    
"In line with a programme outlined by the federal government all 
important agencies and organizations will have to be Y2K-compliant. 
The CAA is part of this scheme and we plan to send a response to 
the ICAO request soon," he said. However, the official did admit 
that the deadline had indeed passed.

QUETTA, Sept 7: Malik Sarwar Khan Kakar, a former provincial 
minister for Revenue and Zakat, has moved a privilege motion in the 
Balochistan Assembly against his removal as minister from the 
provincial Cabinet.
    
Speaker Mir Abdul Jabbar who was presiding over the session allowed 
the former minister to move the motion saying that it would be 
discussed on Wednesday next as after tabling it the motion has 
become property of the House.
    
Malik Sarwar Khan Kakar pleaded in his privilege motion that he was 
sacked from the Cabinet without issuing show cause notice and 
completing other formalities, which are necessary before taking 
such action against any minister. He said that without completing 
these formalities his removal as provincial minister was a breach 
of his privilege.

<a name="taxc">Tax collectors pocket 7pc of GDP, says Imran</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Sept 6: Tehrik-i-Insaaf President Imran Khan has claimed 
that seven percent of the country's GDP is 'grabbed' by tax 
collectors.

Quoting former caretaker finance minister Shahid Javed Burki, he 
said in 1996 total taxation was 14 percent of the GDP which, with 
the additional taxation during the past three years and enlargement 
of taxation base, must have increased to 18 percent. "Of this seven 
percent goes into the pockets of the tax collectors and the 
remaining 11 per cent to the national exchequer."

According to him, if so much of the assessed taxes are taken away 
by the tax collectors, then people are justified in protesting 
against the GST and other levies.

Imran Khan said his party, if voted to power, would frame a law 
against conflict of interests to ensure that the ruling classes did 
not lay down economic policies geared to benefit them.

<a name="dete">Detention a folly, says Fazl after release</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Sept 6: The chief of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, 
Maulana Fazlur Rehman, was released after three days in detention. 
He was detained for trying to address a rally in support of Osama 
bin Laden in a tribal area where political gatherings are barred.

The release came a day after the JUI threatened countrywide 
demonstrations. The divisional commissioner of Dera Ismail Khan met 
the JUI chief in Chashma Rest House and told him that the 
government had withdrawn the detention orders. Later, he was 
brought in a big procession to Dera Ismail Khan.

Talking to reporters, the JUI chief attacked the government and the 
United States, which wants the Taliban to expel Bin Laden from 
Afghanistan.

The government has made Pakistan subservient to US interests and 
its wrong economic policies have put the nation at the mercy of the 
International Monetary Fund and other lending agencies, he said.

Maulana Fazl said the Sept 4 nationwide strike by traders against 
the imposition of the GST demonstrated people's anger at the 
economic mismanagement. He accused the US of meddling in Pakistan 
and Afghanistan. He said that his detention and barring his entry 
in Waziristan agencies was a "foolish decision". He claimed that 
rulers were afraid of the JUI's anti-US drive and his detention was 
aimed at foiling the campaign.

He threatened that if Fazlur Rehman's entry in Waziristan was 
banned, helicopter or aircraft carrying prime minister or president 
would never be allowed to land in tribal areas.

He claimed that rulers had signed a pact to provide all assistance 
to US against Bin Laden and Taliban government to shut the chapter 
of an Islamic government in Afghanistan. How could one expect the 
Pakistan nation would present bouquets in reply to US missiles 
fired at Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The JUI chief was of the view that solution to all the problems was 
lying in the change of system. He said rulers and opposition were 
two faces of the same coin as both were loyal to the US and added 
that removal of rulers was the cry of the day.

The JUI has held a series of rallies to condemn the US hunt for Bin 
Laden who has been accused by Washington of masterminding the East 
African embassy bombings in August 1998.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

SIALKOT, Sept 6: Former prime minister of Azad Kashmir and 
President of the Muslim Conference Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan said 

India would have to quit Kashmir as it could not keep it subjugated 
by force for long.

Kargil was the first step towards liberation of Kashmir from the 
Indian control. Now the Mujahideen will open Kargil-like fronts 
wherever they like, Mr Khan said while talking to NNI. India would 
have to withdraw from the occupied Valley, he added.

Mr Khan said the prudence and courage with which the Pakistan 
government had highlighted the Kashmir issue throughout the world 
was praiseworthy. "The Washington accord was no treason or 
betrayal. It was in the interest of the Kashmiris and Pakistanis, 
and we fully endorse it," he added.

He urged the self-styled jihad organizations not to waste money on 
rallies in Pakistan and donate it to the Kashmiris. "If they are 
sincere to the Kashmir cause, they should spend the same amount on 
welfare of the Kashmiris."

He called upon the United Nations to pressurize India to stop 
committing atrocities in the Valley and hold a plebiscite, as 
pledged in its resolutions.-NNI

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Nasir Malick

LONDON, Sept 9: Muttahida Qaumi Movement Secretary General Dr Imran 
Farooq surfaced in London after remaining in hiding for more than 
seven years in Pakistan and has sought political asylum.
    
"I arrived in London yesterday (Wednesday) evening and have sought 
political asylum in the United Kingdom," he said. Sporting a beard, 
the MQM secretary general who had been declared a terrorist and an 
absconder by the Sindh government, appeared fresh and in good 
health as he sat next to MQM chief Altaf Hussain who kissed him 
before introducing him to the reporters.
    
The Sindh government had initially announced head-money of 
Rs700,000 for the "capture of Dr Imran, dead or alive". On Jan 2, 
1995 it raised the head money to Rs3 million through an official 
notification.
    
The MQM Secretary General said he made several attempts in the past 
to leave the country but did not succeed. He refused to divulge, 
however, details of how he reached London but expressed his 
gratitude to all those in Karachi who provided him refuge in their 
homes without fear of state persecution.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 7: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement has called for a 
complete shutdown in Sindh to protest against extra judicial 
killings and police action against small traders and businessmen.
    
The MQM parliamentary party leader Dr Farooq Sattar said the 
Pakistan Awami Ittehad, Pakistan Peoples Party, Awami National 
Party, Pakistan Awami Tehrik, Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf had supported 
the province-wide strike against the mounting police excesses.

He declared that a consensus was emerging among the opposition 
parties that during their anti-government campaign if an activist 
or supporter of any of the component parties was extra judicially 
killed anywhere in the country, the opposition would respond by 
resorting to nationwide strike.
    
Castigating the "extra judicial killings of two more MQM activists, 
Dr Sattar said in no civilized society innocent citizens were 
killed in such a manner by the police and security agencies. 

Their killing brought the figure of extra judicial killing to 26 
since the imposition of governor�s rule in Sindh.

<a name="bena">Benazir claims credit for Agosta sub</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 7: Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto has welcomed 
the induction of French-built Agosta submarine in Pakistan Navy and 
said that it was the PPP government which negotiated and concluded 
an agreement with France for strengthening the navy�s capabilities.
    
In a statement the opposition leader said the Nawaz government was 
now describing the commissioning of Khalid as a "landmark for 
Pakistan Navy" but the same government on assuming office had 
politicized the deal to tarnish the image of the opposition leader.
    
The former Prime Minister recalled that a few months ago the Indian 
naval chief had also publicly acknowledged that Agosta had given an 
edge to Pakistan Navy. That admission by the Indian naval chief 
should have served to open the eyes of those who were opposing her 
government�s decision to buy the latest submarines for the Navy, 
she said. If even our adversaries admit the superiority of Agostas 
the decision to buy these for Pakistan must have been in our 
highest national interest, she added.
    
The deal was transparent and insured transfer of technology to 
Pakistan to overhaul, maintain and fabricate essential components 
locally, she said. But Nawaz Sharif unfortunately criticized the 
deal even at the cost of the national defence and security for 
cheap political propaganda, she said. Similarly, Ms Bhutto said the 
PPP government also wanted to equip the air force with the latest 
Mirages to maintain its technological edge but Nawaz Sharif 
politicized it too and deprived the PAF of the much-needed 
replenishment of its depleted capability.

LAHORE, Sept 8: Claiming that the PML government would be out of 
power before the beginning of November, Pakistan Awami Tehrik 
chairman Dr Tahirul Qadri declared that his party would resist 
fresh elections if held without an across-the-board accountability 
of all corrupt people.

"We�ll make such elections impossible to hold. We�ll not hesitate 
even from going to a war to avert elections without 
accountability," he said at a news conference at his Model Town

years were consumed for accountability process.
    
"Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is bound to quit. It�s a matter of 
days or weeks. He will have to go. Nobody can keep him in power any 
more," claimed the PAT chief.
    
He said if Mr. Nawaz Sharif stepped down as a result of the public 
pressure, President Rafiq Tarar would automatically start behaving 
like the head of state and take decisions in the interest of the 
nation. He said he would not like a single party to form the 
interim government. The caretaker government should be of a 
national complexion, Dr Qadri added.

<a name="21in">21 injured in blasts outside madressah</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, Sept 6: At least 21 people, majority of them students, 
received injuries when two bombs exploded outside a madressah in 
Gulshan-i-Iqbal.

Except for four who were admitted to hospitals, all others received 
minor injuries, according to police and a neighbourhood private 
hospital, which claimed it, received 20 to 25 people with injuries 
caused by blasts. Later, 10 of the injured were shifted to Civil 
and Abassi Shaheed hospitals.

The sound of the blast was so deafening that it shattered the 
window panes of not only the madressah building, but also of a 
number of houses of the neighbourhood.

The bombs went off in the backside of Madrasa-e-Jamia Ashraf in the 
block-II of Gulshan Iqbal at around 3pm. Each contained 400 grams 
of explosive and was fitted with a timing device of one to 15 
minutes, bomb disposal expert Mr Moinuddin said.

One went off in a drain close to the school and the other four 
minutes later on Toyota Hilux (EX-3602). The vehicle was set on 
fire and 21 people, who also included pedestrians, were injured, 
according to hospital and madressah sources.

Police described the bombings as an "act of terrorism" without 
blaming any group. They announced the setting up of a team headed 
by a superintendent of police to investigate the matter.

<a name="imfw">IMF wants firm commitment </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Sept 8: The IMF is waiting for a firm public commitment 
from the top leadership of the Nawaz government to "impose and 
implement" the GST, otherwise the Pakistan programme will be off, 
IMF insiders.
    
We need a firm political commitment and the will to back up what 
they sign. Even if they sign the Letter of Intent (LOI) and then 
dilly dally in enforcing the GST, it would not do, the official 
warned.
    
The situation about the LOI is that the IMF is waiting for Finance 
Minister Ishaq Dar to sign it, but not in a way that betrays lack 
of political will to implement the programme.
    
The moment the quarterly targets of the GST are not met, the 
programme will be off as this is the bottom-line. What they sign 
will have to be delivered. If countries like Burkina Fasu can 
implement GST, why can�t Pakistan," the official, who sounded very 
bitter, complained.
    
Most of the officials privately agree that the problem in 
implementation of GST was not the traders resistance but the lack 
of moral authority of the political leadership to impose taxes on 
the people when they themselves use every trick in the book not to 
pay their own taxes. The example of prime minister�s own personal 
income tax is quoted repeatedly to hammer this point.

<a name="doub">Double-digit inflation feared in 1999-2000</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Haris Anwar

KARACHI, Sept 6: The inflation rate, which remained subdued during 
last fiscal, is expected to hit the double-digit figure in 1999-
2000.

Leading economists believe that in the absence of factors, which 
kept CPI inflation at about six percent last year, the 
possibilities of containing this year's inflation at the same rate 
are very slim. Last year, the deflationary trend abroad and 
recessionary conditions in the local economy kept prices of general 
consumption goods depressed.

Economists base their forecast of higher inflation on the rapidly 
rising POL prices, government plan to bring the overall subsidies 
on food and agricultural inputs form Rs 9 billion to Rs 2 billion, 
extension of GST to the services and trade sectors and the rupee 
instability in market-based exchange rate system. These measures 
are recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a 
precondition to make available its funding to the cash-strapped 
government.

Pakistan, however, is on the course of gradually implementing these 
measures. The General Sales Tax has been imposed on the 
electricity, gas and petroleum products in the first phase. Subsidy 
on the electricity has been cut to 15 percent from 30 percent, 
while the elimination of the remaining 15 percent and reduction in 
the wheat subsidy have yet to take place.

With the emergence of inflationary trends internationally in oil 
prices, it should not be surprising if next year inflation is 
closer to the double digit figure, said Dr. Sajjad Akhtar, an 
economist at Social Policy and Development Centre (SPDC), a private 
research think-tank.

He said the government's tax measures with simultaneous increase in 
the prices of energy products would eventually be reflected in 
rising prices.

According to an understanding reached with the IMF, the development 
surcharge, a tax on oil products, will be converted into fixed 
specific tax and any increase in the import prices will be 
transferred into higher import prices to protect the projected 
revenue from this tax.

If such an agreement has been reached then we have the prospect of 
rapidly rising POL prices, which will literally fuel inflationary 
pressure in the economy, another leading economist said.

Based on over 20 percent rise on average level of 1998-99 
international oil prices and seven percent depreciation in the 
exchange rate, economists are projecting Rs 13 billion shortfall in 
the development surcharge.

Food and energy group has extensive weightage in Pakistan inflation 
index. These two components account for over 60 percent of the 
general Wholesale Price Index (WPI).

Economists say high and rising inflation poses a serious threat to 
macroeconomic stability. Apart from hurting the poor and fixed 
income groups, a high inflation rate erodes the external 
competitiveness by appreciating the real exchange rate, acting as a 
drag on exports.

<a name="fore">Foreign firm for deletion of safeguards</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rauf Klasra

ISLAMABAD, Sept 6: A US-based agro bio-technological multinational 
firm, Monsanto has asked Pakistan to delete a clause of the 
proposed Intellectual Property and Breeders Rights (IPBR) Act 
offering safeguards against negative impacts of transgenic seed 
varieties.

Monsanto is known for genetically engineered farm varieties of 
various crops and promises to make huge investment in farm sector.

Sources disclosed that the issue came up for discussions with 
concerned official of the ministry of food, agriculture and 
livestock (MINFAL) at a meeting with the representatives of the 
firm on Aug 31. However, both the parties could not reach a 
consensus. The issue may be raised again in the context of any move 
of investment by the multinational. The IPBR Act draft is under the 
finalization process and will shortly be placed before the Cabinet 
for its approval.

German technical agency.
    
According to initial estimates, about two billion dollar investment 
will be required to install a total 1355 mw hydro power capacity 
plant. The projects include: Khan Khwar (72mw); Golen Gol (106mw); 
Daral Khwar (35mw); Summar Gah 928mw); Neelam-Jhelum (963mw) and 
Allai Khwar (130-150mw).

ministry of water and power, Wapda and provincial governments. 
"This time bids will be evaluated on the basis of levelized tariff, 
which means Letter of Support to be issued to the bidder who offers 
the lowest tariff," N.A Zuberi, Vice President, PPIB informed the

ISLAMABAD, Sept 4: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has asked the 
Governor State Bank to direct commercial banks to advance housing 
loans by earmarking a 'substantial percentage of their loan 
portfolio, like they do for other industrial and commercial 
projects'.

Official sources said the ministry of finance has also been 
directed by the Prime Minister to make available to the Prime 
Minister Housing Authority (PMHA) Rs 10.0bn in the Annual 
Development Programme (ADP) of '99-2000. An amount of Rs100m from 
this amount is expected to be released by the MoF immediately.

ISLAMABAD, Sept 7: Presidents of UBL, ABL and representatives of 
other local and foreign banks met Senator Saif-ur Rehman and 
assured him to provide all necessary financial support for 
constructing half a million houses and apartments at a cost of 
Rs400 billion.

President of United Bank Limited (UBL) Zubair Soomro and President 
of Allied Bank of Pakistan (ABL) Rashid Chaudhry held three-hour 
long meeting with Chairman Prime Minister Hosing Authority (PMHA) 
Senator Saif ur Rehman Khan. Senior bankers of Habib Bank Limited 
(HBL), Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB), Citibank and other banks were 
also present during the meeting.
    
Mr.Rashid Chaudhry president of ABL denied that banks were facing 
any pressure to lend money to the housing project. It is very sad 
that newspapers were publishing absolutely incorrect stories that 
there was certain pressure on banks by the Ehtesab Bureau to 
allocate funds for the housing project", he said.
    
The president of the ABL said that the housing project was very 
much financially viable for which it will be fully supported by the 
local and the foreign banks.

themselves registered, has been removed.
    
Talking to reporters after a meeting with the business leaders, he 
said CBR has decided to take four major steps to remove budget 
anomalies following demands put forth by FPCCI and other trade 
bodies.
    
A permanent committee has been set up to monitor reassessment of 
goods stored at the bonded warehouses. Five-stage audit of the GST-
assessees has been done away with, and only one departmental audit 
would be carried out, annually, apart from the intermittent audits 
conducted on suspicion of evasion.
    
The Import Trade Price System would be gradually removed in 
assessing import duty and the WTO-sponsored evaluation system 
launched from Oct 1, �99.

<a name="belt">BEL takeover exposes SBP monitoring ability</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Sept 4: All claims of technological upgradation, 
improvement in on-site and off-site inspections and setting up of 
"early warning desks" with the help of World Bank funded 
consultants and advisors in the last three years fell flat, when 
the Governor of State Bank of Pakistan came down heavily on another 
bank, this time the Bankers Equity Limited (BEL) on Wednesday.

Reports suggest that the BEL has a deposit base of Rs 5.2 billion 
with an advances portfolio of Rs 12 billion. It faces a loss of Rs 
one billion in 1999. The option now for the SBP is to inject fund 
as it did in case of United Bank-Rs 21 billion-or liquidate the 
institution.

The Board of Directors and the senior executives of the BEL were 
removed on charges of corruption, embezzlement of funds, mis-
reporting of accounts and a host of other irregularities. These 
included retaining about Rs 800 million funds received from the 
clients in respect of locally made machinery (LMM) instead of 
depositing it with the State Bank and allocation of Rs 1.2 billion 
loan to Kashmir Sugar mills. 

Who are the sponsors of the Kashmir Sugar mills? When this loan was 
sanctioned and disbursed? Why no action was taken to stop its 
disbursement when it was against the advice of the central bank? 
The SBP Governor did not bother to inform the public of the answers 
of these questions.

It goes to the credit of the present SBP Governor, who since late 
July 1993, when he took over the present assignment, had taken 
extreme actions of administrative takeover against three banks so 
far. These are Mehran Bank, the United Bank and now the BEL. The 
case of Capital Bank should also be included in this list of 
'credits' because the State Bank shares some responsibility in its 
sanctioning and in its shares subscription by the public.

The building up of 11 billion dollars foreign currency deposits, 
its squandering by the governments in power and then its ultimate 
freezing on May 28, 1998 is also one of the feathers that the 
governor will carry with him when he retires next February. One can 
only hope and pray that the list of such 'credits' do not get 
enlarged in the next six months.

The BEL is one of the 'newest' financial institutions set up in 
1980 by the government. It was set up to promote Islamic 
instruments, specially equity finance and to provide capital to the 
private industry by underwriting equity issues and arranging 
consortia financing from the nationalized commercial banks.

Led by D.M. Qureshi, who is now serving in Saudi Arabia in a key 
position in the Islamic Development Bank, the BEL team did well in 
setting up of a number of industrial units.

The BEL was handed over to the Long Term Venture (LTV) Modarba 
group in June 1996 at Rs 18.50 a share when its balance sheet 
showed the break up value of share at over Rs 20. How it happened 
is a question that State Bank will have to offer answer some day. 
Then the BEL's paid-up capital was Rs 655 million and reserves of 
Rs 680 million.

On Thursday (Sept 2), the State Bank Governor in his sermon to the 
bankers exhorted them to learn to say "NO" and pick up courage to 
stand up against all the pressures. There was none on June 12, 1996 
to say "NO" when the BEL was sold away at Rs 280 million in the 
'privatization bazar'.

The BEL's financial stability in 1996 can be established from the 
fact that it was selected as the administrative unit or the apex 
institution to disburse a 200 million dollar World Bank loan for 
the industrial projects in Pakistan.

The Asian Development Bank was also put in 100 million dollars and 
the total disbursement for industrial projects was to be over 1 
billion dollars. Mainly because of the high cost of this financing, 
when it was calculated at 24.27 for the borrowers (it included 7.7 
per cent World Bank commitment charges, 11.6 per cent foreign 
exchange cover exchange cost, 2 per cent guarantee cost plus other 
charges), the investors stayed away and the World Bank loan 
remained unutilized.

In April 1998, the World Bank is reported to have cancelled 150 
million dollars of the 200 million dollars amount. It provided 50 
million dollars to Pak-Kuwait Investment Company. But the PKIC also 
could not find investors and eventually the World Bank has 
cancelled 38 million dollars from this loan amount and provided 12 
million dollars as technical assistance to the State Bank of 
Pakistan and the Privatization Commission.

Actually, the World Bank's total package was of 216 million 
dollars. It included bulk component of 200 million dollars of loan 
for industrial projects and 16 million dollars technical assistance 
offered under the Financial Sector Deepening and Intermediation 
Project (FSDIC).

Under the 16 million dollar technical assistance, the State Bank 
was given 5.4 million dollars, Privatization Commission 1.4 million 
dollars, Corporate Law Authority 2.37 million dollars, Controller 
of Insurance 2.12 million dollars, BEL 1.05 million dollars and 1.7 
million dollars were not allocated but retained in the package.

Inquiries made with the relevant quarters reveal that bulk of the 
technical assistance amount-4 million dollars-has been invested in 
the State Bank during the last two and half a years. The State Bank 
appointed a well-known foreign firm Arthur Anderson against the 
World Bank assistance fund.

The State Bank claimed to have strengthened its on-site and off 
site inspection of the financial sector. The organizational 
structure of the State Bank's administrative divisions were re-
designed and new divisions and sections were set up.

In 1997, the State Bank claimed to have set up "early warning 
desks" that would scrutinize the reports and statements of the 
financial institutions and would ring alarm bell whenever it was 
felt. But then in case of BEL it was too late as confessed by the 
State Bank Governor himself, who has outlined a number of steps to 
ensure that there was no further leakage and hemorrhage of the 
leftover funds.

Now the size of the World Bank technical assistance funds has 
increased to 28 million dollars from the original 16 million 
dollars. The recipients of this technical assistance will now only 
be the State Bank and the Privatization Commission as the other 
segments of financial sector are being looked after by the Asian 
Development Bank.

Financial analysts now foresee the number of the World Bank funded 
advisors and consultants in the State Bank of Pakistan and the 
Privatization Commission likely to be increased along with 
extension in the tenure of those who are already engaged in the 
last two years following the enhancement in the technical 
assistance programme.

In its previous programme, the World Bank has put the conditions of 
privatization of UBL, HBL, State Life Insurance Corporation. For 
one reason or the other, the World Bank wants speedy privatization 
of these two banks with offering of remaining government 
shareholdings in the Muslim Commercial Bank and the Allied Bank.

No funds are being provided by the World Bank, Asian Development 
Bank or any agency of the United Nations to help countries like 
Pakistan to take stock of the gains or losses sustained in the 
privatization programmes. None of the non-governmental 
organizations (NGOs) in Pakistan which are funded lavishly by the 
foreign agencies are ready to undertake this exercise of the 
results of the privatization of MCB, ABL and a number of major 
industrial units. How many of these have improved their production 
techniques? How much more jobs they have created?. How much revenue 
they generate? What is the sum total of gains, if there are any, or 
losses sustained because of this?

Answers of these questions are very necessary for countries like 
Pakistan before hiring fat salaried consultants and financial 
advisors to undertake privatization.

<a name="kara">Karachi: earthquake scene-2</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

IF Nawaz Sharif feels that he can survive and do wrong for ever by 
amending the Constitution, changing the laws, subverting the 
judiciary, oppressing and taxing the people at will whilst 
indiscriminately squandering their money, and by misgoverning with 
deliberation, he is surely mistaken.

As far as Karachi is concerned, yesterday's strike was sustained by 
the people. The lame-duck crooked opposition leaders, who grab at 

any available opportunity to make a nuisance of themselves, did 
their utmost to use it to their advantage. It was an effective 
strike of stomachs belonging to various denominations, some 
deserving some not. When stomachs rebel against authority they do 
so irrespective of the consequences that may follow.

Thanks to Nawaz Sharif, the economy of Karachi effectively stopped 
generating as of noon on Friday the 3rd and will not gain momentum 
until noon on Tuesday the 7th, after the armed forces have 
celebrated their victories over the years from 1965 onwards, the 
year during which Ayub Khan declared September 6 as 'Defence Day,' 
a public holiday, to commemorate his great victory.

Now to the subject matter of this column, an extension of what was 
written last week - dangerous buildings.

In Turkey, the earthquake score now stands at some 50,000 dead and 
500,000 homeless. The building control authorities of the Turkish 
cities, like ours, are corrupt to the core, and have their fair 
share of unscrupulous crooked builders and developers. Ishak 
Alaton, a 70-year-old Turkish businessman, philanthropist, and 
commentator on Turkish norms and practices, has this to say about 
the recent catastrophe:

"Our company, Alarko, has constructed hundreds of houses and 
factories in that particular area. I am proud to say that in these 
constructions that were built in the last four decades, not one 
single crack occurred. The simple reason is that we, like all 
serious contractors and builders in that area, applied the 
prevailing Turkish codes of construction, which allow for an 
earthquake that would be 9.2 on the Richter scale. The great loss 
of life is the result of unscrupulous small developers and builders 
setting up apartments in loose riverbeds and land reclaimed from 
the sea without laying the necessary foundations. Unfortunately, no 
technical control by the municipalities was applied, due to the 
collusion between unscrupulous builders and local municipal 
bureaucracies." (Newsweek, September 6)

The people of Karachi may not remember how, to save its own skin in 
its own particular convoluted way, the Karachi Building Control 
Authority (KBCA), under pressure from concerned citizens (mainly 
the NGO SHEHRI which has the good fortune of being guided by the 
public-spirited volunteer Engineer Roland de Souza), published a 
public warning in Dawn on January 10 1997.

The warning listed 262 buildings. The text read: "The following 
buildings which were constructed against the approved building 
plans have been sealed by the KBCA and therefore the general public 
is informed not to enter into any transactions with the builders."

It informed the people yet again that in terms of the Sindh 
Building Control Ordinance 1979 it is mandatory that people occupy 
premises only after the builders have been given completion and 
occupancy certificates by the KBCA.

Again, under pressure and to cover themselves, another warning was 
published by the KBCA on September 1, 1998, listing 26 high-rises 
of the 262 buildings, all 26 on the Sharea Faisal: Jason Trade 
Towers, Al-Kamran Centre, Fortune Centre, Progressive Square, 

Business Avenue, Shaheen Towers, Amber Towers (Block 6), Amber 
Castle, Shaheen View, Doctors Plaza, Amber Pride, Marine Faisal, 
Hannan Centre, Tax Free Plaza, Anum Classic, Kawish Crown, 
Metropolitan Bank, Faisal Towers, Fayyaz Plaza, Amber Towers 
(SMCHS), Mehdi Towers, Falaknaz Towers, three unnamed highrises 
standing on 15-A, 20-A and 29-A Block 6, and one unnamed high-rise 
on 47 Darul Aman.

This time the warning was more specific. People were told that 
these buildings "are being constructed in contravention of the 
approved building plans . . . additionally the unauthorised 
construction is potentially dangerous as [buildings] are being 
built without an approved plan, [they] have not been properly 
supervised by a KBCA licensed architect/engineer. They are being 
constructed in violation of the earthquake resistance design."

Through collusion between the KBCA building controllers, their 
lawyers, the builders and their lawyers, and the courts, even after 
publication of this notice most of these dangerously constructed 
buildings have been completed and a number of them are occupied.

Take the case of Fortune Towers, standing incomplete on the left of 
Sharea Faisal going towards the airport. This construction, from 
point one, was challenged by the NGO, SHEHRI, so far 
unsuccessfully.

On August 8, 1997, the KBCA, duly greased, approved a plan, which 
it should not have done, for the construction of ground plus twelve 
commercial floors on a residential plot not legally converted. On 
December 18 1997, the KBCA, approved a revised building plan 
allowing ground plus sixteen floors.

SHEHRI is still fighting. Involved in this collusion, apart from 
the KBCA, its men and lawyers, the builders and their lawyers, are 
various courts at various stages.

This incomplete structure should cover a built-up area, illegally 
allowed by the KBCA, of 113,068 square feet. But what stands today 
covers a built-up area of 364,826 square feet, over three times the 
area originally approved. Needless to say, the structure does not 
meet with earthquake resistance standards.

Next, to Al-Karam Centre on the right of Sharea Faisal going 
towards the airport, opposite the Nursery market. The approved plan 
allowed for ground plus eight floors.

The builders built ground plus twelve, under cover of stay orders 
of sorts obtained from courts. Subsequently the High Court vacated 
the stay orders leaving KBCA free to act.

It started demolition proceedings in accordance with the law and 
had demolished or rendered uninhabitable the top two floors when 
the Secretary of Housing and Town Planning (HTP), Faisal Saud, 
instructed the Director-General of the KDA and the Commissioner of 
Karachi to stop the demolition work. At noon on May 3, 1999, it was 
stopped.

On May 5, 1999, I wrote to Governor Haider: "On May 4, Faisal Saud 
was asked at the meeting of the KDA Governing Body why he had 
interfered with the due process of law. He advised that he had done 
so on your instructions conveyed to him on the telephone by your 
Military Secretary. It seems that you have been misinformed and 
thus have ordered as you did. It is inconceivable that you could 
have stalled the due process of law, allowing time to the builders 
to have the building occupied by rented crowds."

Some days later I met the governor but he did not disclose who or 
what had got under his skin. The order had been issued by him 
whilst he was in Islamabad.

The illegally approved plan of this building permitted the building 
of 21,381 square feet. The builder built 86,130 square feet, over 
four times as much.

Now, the builders and their organization, the Association of 
Builders and Developers (ABAD), feel that whatever the builders 
build illegally and not in accordance with the law of the land, and 
every other criminal act, should be regularized by the government. 

They recently wrote to the editor of this newspaper, copying me: 
"The negative attitude of SHEHRI towards regularization of 
irregular illegal buildings has made the issue more [complicated]. 
In every major city of Pakistan, regularization is considered a 
compoundable offence, whereas because of bias and blackmailing 
attitude of this NGO neither KBCA entertains plans for 
completion/regularization nor Government has come up with any final 
answer to this apathy."

The committees constituted and notified to oversee the operation of 
the KBCA and the KDA Governing Body, on both of which sit 
responsible representatives of the people, are to some extent 
effective. That is proven by the fact that Secretary, HTP, Faisal 
Saud, wants both disbanded and reconstituted with purchasable 
individuals and bodies.

The secretary is frustrated, and in his frustration, from January 1 
of this year, he has transferred and reposted 43 officers angling 
to be posted to positions of their liking. Of the 43, by law the 
secretary was empowered to transfer only three, the KDA Governing 
Body having the authority to transfer the other 40. But then, it is 
said that transferring and reposting is a lucrative business.

To make things worse, Ghous Ali Shah, in his perfect wisdom, has 
assigned the portfolio of Housing and Town Planning to Dost 
Mohammed Faizi. People well know the propensities of Ghous and of 
Faizi, and they will resist. 

To live in a dwelling which meets with laid-down standards is their 
legitimate due.

<a name="outo">Out of breath already </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

NAWAZ SHARIF is not the victim of evil circumstances. To think so 
would be to flatter him. He is the author of his own misfortunes, 
the dangers threatening to overwhelm his government being the 
direct outcome of his personal failings.

Which other Prime Minister would have handled Kargil the way he 
did? Which other Prime Minister would have first given the okay to 
this expedition, without of course realizing what he was getting 
into, and then made such a hash of the follow-up retreat? Which 
other Prime Minister would have brought so much gratuitous 
humiliation to the nation? Which other Prime Minister would have 
sent Ghous Ali Shah and, of all policemen, Rana Maqbool to Sindh?

The storm-clouds of agitation gathering on the horizon are merely 
catalysts which are stripping the veil from a larger truth: that 
the heavy mandate was an aberration and that in trying to tackle 
the country's problems this government simply has been out of its 
depth. True, if circumstances had been kinder, this process of 
exposure might have taken longer. But then the prime minister and 
his team should not have tempted fate the way they have done, thus 
bringing their hour of reckoning that much closer. 

History may have no design or purpose but one factor runs 
constantly through it: hubris and arrogance exact their own 
retribution and bring about their own fall. Pakistan has known 
plenty of arrogant and less than able rulers. But such a marriage 
of audacity and incompetence as is now to be seen is virtually 
unparalleled. At the same time, for a seemingly strong government 
to have its balloon pricked so quickly is also unparalleled.

This has come about even if, and this is a point worth noting, no 
full-fledged agitation against the government has yet started. 
Whether the people are tired or are not fully fired up is beside 
the point. What we are seeing are just the first mutterings of 
discontent with the crowds still not pouring into the streets in 
any great demonstration of anti-government anger. Even so, the 
government is shaken. It has faced just the first few blasts from 
an autumn wind and it already looks stricken. 

The agitation�s against Ayub Khan and Bhutto were serious affairs. 
The first of these lasted four months, that against Bhutto six 
months. But even though both were frenzied affairs, those oligarchs 
did not look half as shaken when their end came as the keepers of 
the heavy mandate are doing in this relatively early season. What 
if the going gets tougher? It is going to put a strain on the 
equanimity of the Prime Minister and his team. Already they are 
saying things they should not. Shahbaz Sharif's description of the 
combined opposition as a grouping of "thieves and dacoits" is a 
case in point. Was this a considered statement or the telltale sign 
of a premature panic?

In his first term as prime minister, Nawaz Sharif once said he was 
not afraid of confrontation because he was a product of 
confrontation - fateful words which might yet come to haunt him 
just as Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's great boast that he was a man of 
crisis came to haunt the latter in 1977.

Which are the confrontations Nawaz Sharif has to his credit? Three 
of them: against Benazir Bhutto, against Ghulam Ishaq Khan and with 
India over Kargil. In the first of these showdowns Nawaz Sharif had 
the full backing of the army, the intelligence agencies, the then 
president (Ghulam Ishaq Khan) and the Punjabi establishment. If he 
came out on top, the honours were widely shared. 

In his confrontation against Ghulam Ishaq Khan he had the backing 
of the Punjabi establishment, including the Supreme Court under 
Nasim Hasan Shah. The first round in that confrontation, which was 
confined to the Supreme Court, Nawaz Sharif handily won. But when 
the issue was joined by the then army chief, General Waheed, some 
of Nawaz Sharif's iron resolve crumbledand he agreed to step down 
as prime minister. His only consolation was that in going down he 
also took Ishaq with him.

As for Kargil, light lie the ashes of Pakistani pride. To have 
created such a mess in the first place. That required genius. Then 
to have beaten such a headlong retreat. That too required genius. 

How is Nawaz Sharif likely to fare in this the fourth 
confrontation, which is staring him in the face? The signs are not 
auspicious. He is all on his own, the army and its spymasters, 
their support and largesse so crucial to him in the past, are in a 
sullen mood, certainly in no mood to bail him out. Not this time. 
Kargil and its aftermath have seen to that. 

Moreover, the opposition parties have got together sooner than many 
pundits would have expected. The PPP, ANP and MQM on one platform 
even if for the moment the platform is creaky and ill defined. It 
is an alarming development nonetheless. And what of Qazi Hussain 
Ahmed? In what threatening tones is he speaking?

If Nawaz Sharif is genuinely bamboozled he is not to blame. Here he 
had seemingly taken care of all threats and insured his stay in 
power for the foreseeable future: got rid of Leghari and installed 
his own man in his place; got rid of a troublesome chief justice 
(Becket to his Henry the Second); and had even replaced one army 
chief with another. As for Benazir Bhutto and her husband, they had 
been virtually drummed out of the political arena. The rest of the 
political parties were like chaff before the wind. The empire of 
the heavy mandate was thus secured. 

And to think that just when the prospect seemed so rosy and 
promising, the fates should have caught up and made an omelette of 
the heavy mandate.

Pakistani rulers may not be able to look beyond their noses but 
even the most inconsequential of them plan their innings on an 
eternal scale, thinking they are going to be around forever. They 
are lucky if they are in health for two or three years. After that 
their energy begins to drain and they become a prey to the 
elements, martial law regimes alone proving impervious to this iron 
law. 

Nawaz Sharif no doubt thought he too was another exception. Nor 
could he be blamed for thinking so. Did he not bestride the world 
of Pakistani politics like a colossus? Had not rival centres of 
authority been either rubbished or cut down to size? All that 
remained was just him and his lengthening shadow. He could do as he 
pleased. There was no one to question him. He could order whatever 
gimmicks caught his fancy and make as many foreign trips as he 
wished.

A pity that this gathering crisis has revealed that although to all 
outward form he may still look a giant, his feet are of clay. This 
then is one confrontation for which the self-proclaimed man of 
confrontation seems wholly unprepared. It is shaping up badly for 
him, which is probably the reason why everyone in his camp seems to 
be out of breath already.

<a name="infl">Inflationary bite of IMF fang</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By S Hasan Asad

The government appears to have finally decided to impose sales tax 
on power, gas and services/professionals sectors. Having postponed 
the imposition of this tax for the first quarter of the current 
financial year, the federal government has asked the CBR not to 
delay it beyond September.
    
The issue is why was this decision not taken in the federal budget 
in June and was postponed till September when it was agreed in the 
accord with the IMF that the GST will be formally extended to 
services, petroleum products, electricity and agricultural inputs 
and cross subsidies on gas and electricity will be withdrawn?

 The explanation is that it was considered appropriate to avoid the 
bitter pill as long as possible. A glaring example is that of 
telephone in which case the excise duty was lowered from 25 per 
cent to 15 per cent in the budget, whereas soon after the budget 
the tariff was jacked up appreciably raising the charges up to 30 
per cent.
    
The mini-budgets of the magnitude envisaged would spur inflation 
with serious impact on exports, domestic demand, income 
distribution and social discontent. The finance minister in his 
budget speech said that inflation will "go down" to 6 per cent from 
6.1 per cent last year. On the basis of the premise of lower 
inflation, the government in May reduced the profit rates on 
national savings schemes which has further eroded the income of 
pensioners, widows and other low income people who invest in these 
schemes. The consumer price index, as prepared by the Federal 
Bureau of Statistics, is faulty as common man experiences inflation 
by a fall in his real income.
    
According to independent analysts, the current inflation rate is 
around 15 per cent annually or more than double the rate assumed by 
the government. The mini-budgets, contemplated by the IMF, would 
raise the price spiral to 20 per cent or beyond.
    
Now that the release of the fourth tranche of $280 million out of 
$1.56 billion ESAF programme is due, there are indications that the 
government may have to impose taxes worth around Rs25 billion to 
attain the revenue target of Rs356 billion. After tough 
negotiations with Pakistan�s delegation led by Ishaq Dar at 
Washington in July, the IMF team is coming to Pakistan this month 
to review the fulfillment of different conditionalities which, 
besides GST on a wide range of goods and services, would include 
agricultural income tax, withdrawal of subsidies on gas and power, 
formation of Pakistan Revenue Authority, acceleration in 
privatization process, increase in the number of registered 
taxpayers to 1.8 million by May 31, 1999, and the IPPs issue. 

There are also rumors of devaluation. The other day the prime 
minister himself stated that we want to fulfil all conditions and 
agreements with the donor agencies. In this connection, he 
specifically mentioned the conditionality regarding withdrawal of 
subsidy on electricity tariff introduced in September last year. 

Yet prime minister�s decision of 50 per cent reduction in the flat 
tariff of electricity for tube-wells used in agriculture could not 
have come at a worse moment than when discussions where on with the 
IMF in Washington. In fact, the release of the tranche probably in 
September will be contingent upon the fulfillment of various 
conditionalities.
    
The impact of rising petroleum prices is pervasive and cannot be 
ignored as only recently in May their prices have been hiked by 10 
per cent following the unification of dual exchange rate. In other 
words, in a short period of three months, these prices would shoot 
up by hefty 25 per cent.

The government has drawn a phased plan for the withdrawal of gas 
subsidies. Recently, the subsidy on gas for some fertilizer units 
has been cut in the first phase.
 
The manufacturing sector is already groaning under the high cost of 
power and utility charges which is making our products 
uncompetitive overseas and depressing the domestic demand. Further 
hike in these charges would aggravate the problem and deepen the 
recession. Business community has, therefore, expressed grave 
concern over the reported government decision to impose 15 per cent 
sales tax on electricity, gas and petroleum products.
    
It is necessary to take stock of the inflationary momentum and not 
remain complacent with the decline in inflation, as revealed by the 
official statistics. The contention of Ishaq Dar that the levy of 
the GST on utilities will not burden the common man is fallacious. 
The Monopoly Control Authority is ineffective in controlling the 
prices� spiral. The Consumer Protection Act could be a powerful 
tool to help promote healthy marketing culture and thereby assuage 
inflationary impact.
    
The critical questions are: Will the finance minister mull over the 
surge in prices following mini-budgets and come out of the shell of 
contrived price index of the Federal Bureau of Statistics? Has he 
ever pondered over the plight of the hapless common man afflicted 
by the price hike of daily consumer goods? Has not the inequality 
of income distribution worsened over the recent years following the 
liberalization of the economic policy framework? Will not the 
rising prices make the task of attainment of export target arduous? 
Are sugary budgets of any help to common man? What measures have 
been taken by the government to hold the price-line and save the 
people from the inflationary bite of the IMF fang?

CAIRO, Sept 10: Australian Rodney Eyles, champion only two years 
ago, was toppled in the opening match of the World Open Squash

The 32-year-old was beaten 15-9, 13-15, 15-8, 15-13 by the left-
handed Egyptian teenager, Amr Shabana, ranked 35 in the world.
    
Amjad Khan, the 13-seeded nephew of former champion Jansher Khan, 
of Pakistan, was stretched the full distance and kept on court for 
64 minutes by Mohamed Abdul Hafiz, a qualifier from Egypt. Amjad 
won 15-5, 11-15, 15-3, 13-15, 15-9.
    
Amjad�s compatriot Shamsul Islam Khan, ranked 49th in the world,

ISLAMABAD, Sept 10: A three-member PCB inquiry committee will probe 
into the incident involving Test batsman Mohammad Wasim and will 
 present its report in 24 hours before a final decision is taken in 
this regard.
     
Mr Mujeebur Rehman, the chairman PCB ad hoc committee, while

decision taken by the Pakistan Cricket Board Disciplinary Committee 
was an in-built system incorporated to act promptly in case of any 
indiscipline by the cricketers.

Mohammad Wasim were false and there was "set-up" to falsely 
implicate the cricketer.
     
The three-member committee includes Javed Zaman, Col Noushad Ali 
and Hafiz Manzoor Hussain, co-opted member of the PCB ad hoc 
committee.

<a name="newc">New captain vows to do his best </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 8: Newly appointed Pakistan captain Moin Khan said he 
was determined to continue the good job done by his predecessor 
Wasim Akram.
    
"I am a stand-in captain for Wasim Akram. So I am looking forward 
to hand over the team back to him in the same way I have got from 
him," he said.
    
This year under Wasim Akram, Pakistan drew the two-Test series 
against India, clinched the inaugural Asian Test Championship, and 
won the back-to-back triangular contests in India and Sharjah 
before reaching the final of the World Cup.
    
The wicket keeper said the team has blended into a winning 
combination "and the credit of it goes only to Wasim Akram. I wish 
that he soon takes over the charge and lead Pakistan to more 
glories."
    
Referring to the Toronto series, Moin said the members of the side 
were keen to begin the 1999-2000 international season on a winning 
note. But he warned that cricket was a game of uncertainties.  
"Like any other team, we also hate to lose. But only fools predict 
in this sport because the complexion of the game can change in one 
over.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 7: Swashbuckling opener Saeed Anwar was a doubtful 
starter for the Toronto tour despite being picked in a strong 15-
man. The batsman, according to informed sources, is tending his 
wife who is said to be seriously ill.
    
"Saeed has informed the selectors that he is not in a proper frame 
of mind. But he has not ruled out his participation as yet. He has 
asked for a couple of days to decide," informed sources said.
    
If Saeed pulls out from the tour, it would turn out to be a 
blessing in disguise for Shahid Afridi who has been dropped for his 
inconsistent performance in the World Cup.
