<a name="supr">Supreme Court bench to hear petitions against coup</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Dec 1: Supreme Court on Wednesday set up a five-member 
bench to hear petitions challenging the ousting of premier Nawaz 
Sharif in a military takeover in October, officials said.

The bench, led by Chief Justice Saeed-uz-Zaman Siddiqui will hear 
four identical petitions on Monday, they said.

Four other judges in the bench are Mohammad Bashir Jahangiri, Nasir 
Aslam Zahid, Abdur Rehman Khan and Wajeeh-ud-Din Ahmed. The 
petitions were filed last month by Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League 
(PML) and three lawyers, Syed Zafar Ali Shah, a member of suspended 
National Assembly, Iqbal Haider of Muslim Welfare Movement and 
Wahabul Khairi, an advocate.

The PML, which called the army action "illegal and 
unconstitutional", has asked the court to set aside the overthrow 
of Sharif's government. It has also asked the court to overturn the 
suspension of the federal and provincial assemblies. PML lawyers 
said the petition had challenged all actions taken by General 
Musharraf since military takeover on October 12. General Pervez 
Musharraf proclaimed a state of emergency two days after the 
military takeover, suspended the constitution and parliament and 
declared himself chief executive.

The general also issued an order prohibiting the Supreme Court and 
high courts from taking action against him.-AFP

<a name="lawa">Law amended: ATCs to be headed by HC judges</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Dec 2: In a late-night development on Thursday, the 
president promulgated an ordinance amending the Anti-Terrorism Act, 
1997, to the extent that a special anti-terrorism court will now 
consist of a high court judge.

Under section 13 of ATA, 1997, a Special Court for Anti Terrorism 
consisted of a judge who " is or has been a Session Judge or an 
Additional Session Judge".

After the amendment to section 13, a special court for anti-
terrorism will consist of a judge who "is a Judge of High Court."

The provisions of the ordinance, called Anti-Terrorism (Third 
Amendment) Ordinance 1999, will have overriding effects, 
notwithstanding any other provision contained in any other law for 
the time being in force.

Through this amendment the president has provided a new sub section 
to section 13 of the Act.

The new section reads as: 
" Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) and sub-
section (3), the federal government or if so directed by the 
government, the provincial government shall, in addition to the 
existence to special courts or such other special courts as may be 
established in the area, establish one such additional special 
court under this at the principal seat of the Lahore High Court and 
the High Court of Sindh and appoint a judge of such High Court as a 
jude of special court in consultation with the chief justice of the 
High Court concerned, and where a judge of High Court is appointed 
as judge for any area under this Act, he shall be the 
administrative judge for that area and such administrative judge 
may, in addition to the powers exercisable under this Act, either 
suo motu or on the application of any party, at any stage or of the 
proceedings whether before or after framing of charge, for 
sufficient cause including as mentioned in sub-section (1) of 
section 28, transfer, withdraw or recall any case pending before 
any other special court in that area and may either try the case 
himself or make it over for trial to any other special court in 
that area."

"The special court to which a case is transferred or recalled for 
trial under sub-section (4) shall proceed with the case from the 
stage at which it was pending immediately before such transfer or 
recall and it shall not be bound to recall or rehear any witness 
who has given evidence and may act on the evidence already 
recorded."

The ordinance further provided in section 14 of the ATA which 
provided that a special court shall consist of a judge, being a 
person who is or has been a session judge or an additional session 
judge. The amendment has provided that special court will consist 
of a judge of a High Court."

SCHUDLE: The government on Thursday amended the schedule of the 
Anti-Terrorism Act, providing for trial of offences like hijacking 
and criminal conspiracy in special courts.

Former prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif and others are being tried 
in ATA court for, inter alia, hijacking the plane carrying the 
chief of the army staff.

The new amendment to the schedule of ATA Act 1997 provided that 
offences under sections 109, 120A, 120B,121A,122, 123, 295A, 365, 
365A of Pakistan Penal Code could now be tried in ATA courts.

All the offences are already provided in the PPC, and the federal 
government has only changed the forum for trial, Law Minister and 
Attorney-General Aziz A. Munshi told Dawn.

He said section 34 of the ATA empowered the federal government that 
it might, by notification, amend the Schedule so as to add any 
entry thereto or modify or omit any entry therein. "This is not the 

first time that the schedule of ATA has been amendment. It was 
amended twice in the past," he said.

The federal law minister said that under section 17 of the ATA Act 
1997, the ATA court can try any offence other than the schedule 
offence with which the accused might, under the Code, be charged at 
the same trial.

The amendment to the schedule of ATA on Thursday provided the ATA 
court to try cases under section 109. Under this section, the court 
can award punishment for abetment if the act abetted is committed 
in consequence and there is no express provision made for its 
punishment. The court can award the accused punishment of ta'zir, 
including death sentence.

Section 120-A of the PPC defines the criminal conspiracy. Section 
121 of the PPC relates to waging or attempting to wage war or 
abetting waging of war against Pakistan and the accused can be 
punished with death or imprisonment for life and shall also be 
liable to fine.

Section 121-A deals with those facing the charges of depriving the 
country of the sovereignty of her territories or any part of that. 
The accused can be punished with imprisonment for life or any 
shorter term.

Section 122 deals with collecting men, arms or ammunition or 
otherwise prepare to wage war. The accused can be imprisoned for 
life or any shorter term.

Section 123 deals with those acts of concealment with intent to 
facilitate design to wage war against Pakistan. The accused can be 
punishment with imprisonment up to 10 years.

Section 295-A deals with deliberate and malicious acts intended to 
outrage religious feelings or any class by insulting its religious 
or religious beliefs, defiling, etc, of copy of the Holy Quran. The 
accused is liable to be punished with imprisonment for life.

Section 365 deals with kidnapping or abduction with intent to cause 
that person to be secretly and wrongfully confined. He can be 
confined for term not more than seven years. However, 365-A, 
kidnapping or abduction for extorting property, valuable security, 
the accused can be awarded death sentence.

Section 402-A 402-B, and 402 relate to hijacking and the accused 
can be awarded the capital punishment.

<a name="100c">100 courts will be set up to try corrupt: CE</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

TURBAT, Nov 30: The chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, said on 
Tuesday that 100 courts would be established to try the cases of 
corruption and loan defaults.

Addressing the notables of Makran division here, he said six to 
eight of such courts would start functioning in next four to five 
days.

"We will recover the looted money and loans from corrupt people and 
punish them for their deeds. I want to tell you the truth. Corrupt 
people have looted this country mercilessly. The treasury is empty 
and forex reserves are declining," the chief executive said.

He reiterated his resolve to correct this situation by recovering 
bank loans from defaulters and looted money corrupt people and tax 
evaders.

"We will not allow robbery any more and take all those responsible 
to the task," he maintained.

He said the looted money would go back to the treasury and stuck-up 
loans would be collected to improve the banks' position.-APP

<a name="96na">96 names removed from ECL</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov 30: The government has removed the names of 96 tax 
defaulters from the exit control list (ECL) after they cleared 
their dues. It has also allowed the government servants to travel 
abroad by submitting NOC from the head of their respective 
organizations instead of the intelligence bureau.

Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider told a press conference after 
presiding over an exclusive meeting on the issue of ECL in his 
ministry here on Tuesday.

He said the list would be revised on a regular basis. The ban on 
foreign travel of retired government officials and businessmen who 
were not defaulters had also been lifted, he added.

Mr Moin disclosed that the ECL included almost 5,000 names of bank 
and tax defaulters, alleged corrupt politicians and bureaucrats and 
some members of the suspended national and provincial assemblies 
and senate, and others.

Almost 2,300 of these 5,000 names, he said, were already on the ECL 
before the Oct 12 military takeover. Majority of these names were 
included in the ECL on the request of the provincial governments, 
he said.

Mr Moin said the government had also contacted the State Bank to 
give it, within seven days, the updated list of loan defaulters so 
that names of those who had cleared their dues could be delisted 
from the ECL.

The State Bank, he said, would be sharing this information with the 
interior ministry on regular basis to avoid any inconvenience to 
ordinary people. The minister said that the cases of suspended 
parliamentarians were also being reviewed to exclude the names of 
those from the ECL who were neither defaulters nor on the inquiry 
list. The chief executive's approval would be sought in such cases, 
he said.

He also announced that the list would be computerised and round-
the-clock information would be provided on enquiry.

<a name="alld">All debts be cut on top priority: Chief Executive</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec 1: The chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, said 
on Wednesday that internal and external debts should be reduced on 
a priority basis to achieve self-reliance.

He observed this during a luncheon meeting with the members of the 
Economic Advisory Board which is preparing an economic package for 
the country.

He told the EAB members that the economic package should benefit 
the common man and concentrate on the economic imbalances in the 
provinces to promote national cohesion.

He said Pakistan needed to restore the investors' confidence by 
introducing credible and consistent economic policies. The 
investors, he added, should include local and foreign investors, 
and expatriate Pakistanis.

The chief executive said the EAB and 13 sub-groups had done a good 
job by formulating recommendations for the economic reform agenda.

Meanwhile, the EAB, working under Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz, 
concluded its 3-day deliberations for preparing the economic reform 
agenda. 

 On the last day, the leaders of the sub-groups on poverty 
alleviation, energy, information technology and macro-economic 
framework presented their recommendations which were discussed at 
the meeting.

Now the sub-groups will work further on their recommendations in 
the light of the discussions held during the last three days. The 
finance minister asked the sub-groups to complete their 
recommendations quickly.

APP adds: The recommendations (of the sub-groups) would ultimately 
go to the National Security Council and the cabinet before being 
made public, official sources said.

They hoped that the reform package would be announced by the third 
week of December.

"The board is trying to put together a set of proposals which will 
constitute an agenda for the government," the sources said, adding, 
"the reform plan will initially cover a period of two years."

The sources further said: "We want the board (EAB) to work as a 
standing committee, like a think-tank, to meet periodically. From 
time to time, the board will keep bringing and discussing issues of 
economic concern."

<a name="chie">Chief Executive wants end to politics of dissension</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec 3: Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf has advised 
the politicians to shun discord and dissension and work for the 
stability of the country.

"My politician brothers have a very profound role to play and I 
urge them to remove dissension and discord to achieve the 
objectives of stability," he said at the annual dinner of the 
Pakistani American Public Affairs Committee.

He assured the gathering that his government would give political 
stability, improve the economy and strengthen the federation.

Gen Musharraf also asked the Pakistanis living abroad to keep 
themselves away from partisan politics in their adopted countries 
for achieving the much-needed stability in Pakistan. "When we are 
out of Pakistan we should not fight our political battle at the 
cost of Pakistan."

He said the Pakistanis should keep their personal and group 
emotions aside so that the problems of the country could be 
resolved.

The chief executive counted the problems and said the malaise had 
had serious effects on everything. "Our economy has collapsed and 
we are near bankruptcy. We have been looted and plundered. Our 
banks and financial institutions are near being emptied", he 
lamented.

However, he said he was not all that despondent but was an 
optimistic one and, "we shall pull Pakistan out of trouble". He 
praised his economic team, specially Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz, 
and said by December 15, the country would have an economic reform 
agenda. He said he was sure the recommendations prepared by the 
economists and financial experts would pull the country out from 
"present quagmire". 

 The chief executive reiterated the resolve that the government 
would take steps to generate economic activity, restore the 
investors confidence and create investor-friendly environment.

"To achieve this goal we need stability and continuity of policies. 
We need sincerity and credibility and if we bring stability it 
would mean that we are on the right track", he said.

Gen Musharraf said he and the institutions of the army alone could 
not bring stability and added it could be achieved through the 
collective efforts of every Pakistani. "If we err we will rectify 
but errors are not in our intentions".

He said days of manipulation of rules and regulations for personal 
gains were gone. "No crocked aggrandizement. Let our actions speak 
louder than our words", he said, assuring that the set-up he was 
trying to give to the nation would deliver the goods and remove the 
country's major political and economic problems.

Gen Musharraf said each of his associates, be it in the army or 
civil, was working day and night to have some credible system in 
the country. In this regard he referred to his meeting with 36 
financial experts who, he said, had worked selflessly to formulate 
recommendations specially for the economic revival.

Talking about the major problems, he said the country needed to be 
self-reliant. "We shall not beg, we shall not borrow and we must 
get out of the syndrome of borrowing".

The end effort, he said, was to be to provide relief to the poorer 
sections of the society. He regretted those who had been committing 
very minor crimes were given hard punishments but those who 
indulged in big crimes like smuggling and refusing to pay back bank 
loans, had not been taken to task.

The chief executive called upon the rich people to contribute some 
portion from their resources for the poor. Our poor man has never 
let Pakistan down. It is our industrial, religious, political and 
military elites which let Pakistan down", he observed.

Talking about the federation, the chief executive said the slogans 
of provincialism should be discouraged. "Serious cracks are 
developing and I felt so during my recent visit to Balochistan and 
that is why I say that we have to remove the feelings of 
deprivation in the smaller provinces".

He was of the view that the smaller provinces should not feel 
alienated. "They need justice in the distribution of resources, 
funds and jobs", he said adding he had tried to give some 
representation to Balochistan in the cabinet and it had very 
positive effects.

Gen Musharraf stressed the need for devolution of power so that 
development could take place at the grassroots level. "Danger lies 
in denying of power and not giving power".

He said all the government functionaries would have to be made 
subordinate to the masses. "Therefore, I believe that a system has 
to be worked out for having certain checks and balances and the use 
of power and authority with utmost care", he added.

<a name="kuls">Kulsoom to fight for release of Nawaz</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Dec 1: Kulsoom Nawaz, the wife of deposed premier Nawaz 
Sharif, said on Wednesday she would begin a political fight to win 
her husband's freedom. "I am out of my house to fight a battle for 
my innocent husband who is in jail for no crime," 
Begum Kulsoom told AFP in an interview.

"I have never had any ambitions in politics. But now if I am in 
politics, I am here to save my husband," she said. "I will say 
goodbye the moment my husband comes out and I pray all daylong for 
that moment," she said. Although she said she had no plan to lead 
Pakistan Muslim League, she has started attending some party 
meetings.

"It has seasoned and senior leaders who can provide guidelines to 
supporters to run the party," she said. "But I want to raise my 
voice against injustice."

Begum Kulsoom said her life had changed since the ouster of the 
Sharif government by army chief Gen Pervez Musharraf.

"I have not seen my son for the last 50 days. I do not know, where 
he is. Isn't this sad for any woman?" she said. Begum Kulsoom 
complained that a "lobby", which she did not identify, was 
tarnishing the image of the deposed premier's family.

"Now some are saying the Sharifs used to import machinery from 
Israel. They had friendship with (Indian premier Atal Behari) 
Vajpayee. They are corrupt. It is all rubbish," she said.

"We had or have no personal friendship with Vajpayee. We just 
wanted that the Kashmir issue be solved through talks and not 
through war," she said, echoing her husband's policy during the 30-
month rule before he was ousted. "We just wanted a peaceful 
solution to the Kashmir issue without any bloodshed or the killings 
of soldiers. Is it personal friendship?" she asked.

Begum Kulsoom, who held meetings with her husband in prison and in 
court, said Mr Sharif's resolve was firm. He has appealed 
supporters to remain peaceful. The deposed premier, his brother 
Shahbaz Sharif and five other senior officials are accused of 
treason, conspiracy to murder and hijacking a plane.- AFP

<a name="bodi">Bodies dissolved in chemical: Maniac slaughters over 100 boys</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Azmat Abbas

LAHORE, Dec 2: A man claimed to have killed during the last one 
year over 100 boys after subjecting them to criminal assault at his 
three-room house, some 200 yards from the Ravi Road police station.

As an evidence of his claim the suspect left two human skeletons in 
an acid-filled container at the house from where the police 
recovered at least nine bags carrying the clothes and shoes of the 
suspected victims.

Although the police admitted that the murders had been committed at 
the place, they expressed doubts about the exact number of the 
victims.

The dreadful crime came to light on Thursday when a newspaper 
received a parcel containing the pictures of the 100 boys, aged 
between 12 and 15, and a hand-written note from the alleged killer, 
who identified himself as Javed Iqbal, 40.

The exact contents of the note could not be ascertained. However, a 
source said that the man had given in it the details of his killing 
spree that started over a year ago. He claimed that the boys 
murdered had been enticed away from Ravi Road and from around the 
Data Gunj Bakhsh shrine at Bhati Gate. Javed admitted that he had 
committed criminal assault with the victims before murdering them.

"It seems that the man committed sodomy to avenge his own 
humiliation but his claim of killing over 100 boys has yet to be 
verified," said Malik Iqbal, the DIG of Lahore.

"I have received a parcel last night containing the pictures and 
addresses of about 40 boys. In his note, the accused has claimed 
that he had killed all the people in revenge as he, too, had been 
treated in a similar fashion."

Sources, however, said that the police had received the parcel 
about five days ago. The police referred it to the CIA for action. 
The house was placed under surveillance but the police made no 
attempt to check it from inside.

"The staff officer of CIA SP Sarwar and head-constable Umer Hayat 
visited the scene about four days ago. On seeing the door locked 
from outside they left without making further investigations," said 
the sources.

The police reached the scene only after some reporters had entered 
the house by scaling its wall. The reporters found in the house, 
located in a narrow street, several placards nailed to the walls in 
an orderly manner. The writings on these placards give details 
about the victims and the murders.

One placard read: "The five sacks lying in one corner of this room 
contain the clothes of 100 victims while the remaining three 
(sacks) contain 85 pairs of shoes belonging to them. All details 
about the murders are mentioned in the diary and the 32-page 
notebook has been placed in the room. This is my confessional 
statement".

At least four sacks filled with clothes were found in the room and 
some 20 pairs of shoes and sandals were seen lying in another 
corner.

The alleged killer had also written on each of the sacks the exact 
number of garments and shoes in them.

The house emitted an odious smell and there were several drums of 
chemicals lying in a V-shaped storeroom.

The skeletons were recovered from two large containers. At least, 
13 other small containers filled with acid and some other items 
were in the store.

"Today dated November 25, 1999, I have decided to commit suicide. 
Yesterday, I killed my employee, Sajid, and incinerated his body in 
the container so that he could be punished for theft and for 
disturbing me again and again. Now I can (go) to sleep in the 
depths of the Ravi," according to another placard.

Yet another placard read: "The dead bodies in this room have not 
been disposed of intentionally so (that) the administration may 
find them after my suicide".

And another placard read: "If the Ghaziabad SHO had not taken away 
my 'murderer' and had not kept him at his place this tragedy would 
not have happened. He (the SHO) is responsible for the death of 
these 100 people. That fateful night I was asleep in the room with 
my two employees when one of them 'murdered' (sodomized) me. Later, 
he 'murdered' my minor employee."

"I pray for forgiveness to all my friends who helped me. I take 
responsibility for all the acts and bring these blind-murders to 
public, otherwise, you would not have become aware of the reality."

One placard was about the way he had disposed of the bodies: "I am 
indebted to my friends, especially Haji Naseem. I am leaving the 
world with this burden. One more death after the killing of 100 
does not make much difference. The world will remember this mode of 
revenge. The bodies flowed through the sewer just like my blood 
when my employees 'murdered' me."

Talking about the selection of victims, he writes: "Data Darbar and 
the red-light area have been turned into breeding- grounds of 
crime. The runaway children seek refuge there and learn to commit 
murder, theft, pick-pocketing and get involved in immoral 
activities. If the government failed to check this, people would 
find a 'solution' like I did."

Another placard narrates the details of torture Javed claimed he 
had been subjected to by the Ghaziabad police in a fake case.

"The car was sold and I went broke during my medical treatment. All 
routes were leading towards suicide so I decided not to go alone 
and (thus I have) taken several others with me. God heard my 
prayers and helped me. I started playing holi with human blood. Now 
100 mothers would die weeping like my mother did," read a placard.

The police said Javed rented the house about three months ago. He 
set up a chemical manufacturing business there.

Javed rented the house through a real estate dealer, Munir Hussain 
Shah, who has been taken into custody for interrogation.

In his letters to the DIG and the newspaper, Javed also provided 
the addresses of his brothers - Ziaul Haq, Mohammad Shahid and 
Mohammad Pervaiz - in Shadbagh.

The police were preparing to raid their houses when the three 
brothers themselves appeared at the police station. They wanted to 
file a report disowning Javed, stating that he had taken his share 
of the family property and that they should not be held responsible 
for any of his acts.

They were taken into custody and shifted to the CIA headquarters in 
Qila Gujjar Singh for interrogation.

"Either it is a coincidence or they knew what Javed claimed he had 
done," said a police investigator.

Talking to reporters, Ziaul Haq said Javed had married twice and 
had two children. Both the marriages had ended in divorce. He 
claimed that Javed had shifted to a separate house about one-and- 
a-half years ago and no family member had seen Javed or heard from 
him during the past six months.

The DIG said that special teams had been sent to check all the 
addresses given by Javed. "The list contains addresses in Lahore 
and other cities. Therefore, we need some time to verify whether 
his claims are true or not."

"It seems that either we are dealing with a psychopath or the man 
is a liar. It also remains to be verified if he is alive or had 
actually committed suicide," he said.

<a name="scdi">SC disapproves presence of bank staff in large numbers </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec 2: The Supreme Court on Thursday deprecated the 
practice of government employees attending court proceedings in a 
large number when a case involving an official or union of an 
institution was fixed for hearing.

In its detailed judgment on the appeal against the Lahore High 
Court order of declaring the appointment of ADBP chairman as 
invalid, the SC remarked that it was necessary to take note of the 
unhealthy practice.

The apex court had upheld the appointment of the Chairman of the 
ADBP, Fazal Mehboob, by setting aside the Lahore High Court 
judgment.

The 3-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, 
observed that it had become common that when a case involving an 
official/union of an institution, government or authority, was 
fixed for hearing before any court, a large number of 
officers/employees of such body made it a point to attend the court 
proceedings with the apparent intention of expressing their support 
or opposition for one party or the other.

The court held that only those officers/employees who were parties 
to the proceedings, might attend the court with the permission of 
the competent authority after taking leave from their office. The 
practice of other officers/employees attending the proceedings and 
that too without taking leave from their institutions was strongly 
depreciated, it said.

Such practice is not only against the service rules but also 
affects the working of the institutions they belong to.

On last Monday, an interesting thing happened when the lawyer of 
the petitioners, advocate Ibrahim Satti, had stated that the 
president and other officer-bearers of the ADBP union were present 
in the courtroom.

Chief Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui had asked the employees of the 
ADBP present in the courtroom to stand up. When a large number of 
the employees stood up, the chief justice asked why such a large 
number of employees of the bank were sitting in the court without 
any purpose.

The chief justice asked the court staff to call the Deputy 
Registrar Judicial, Budha Khan. When the official reached the 
court, the CJ directed him to take down the names of those present 
in the court.

The deputy registrar Judicial had written the names of 30 employees 
of the ADBP, majority of them senior officials of the bank.

<a name="govt">Govt urged to unfreeze accounts of politicians</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

RAWALPINDI, Dec 3: Some local politicians have demanded the 
government to unfreeze bank accounts of those who are not 
defaulters.

As a result of the seizure of accounts, some local politicians have 
been unable to pay even house utility bills and salaries of their 
servants.

They said last month the authorities of the State Bank had 
announced that bank accounts of those who were not defaulters would 
be unfroze but the orders had yet to be implemented.

"All politicians are not corrupt and defaulters, but they are also 
being treated like corrupt politicians," they added.

They appealed to Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf to look into 
the matter.

<a name="mutt">Muttahida asks govt to produce Farooq in court </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 28: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement has expressed concern 
over the authorities' failure to produce its central leader, Dr 
Farooq Sattar, before a judicial magistrate for the purpose of 
seeking remand.

Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, deputy convener of the MQM 
coordination committee, Aftab Shaikh, said that Dr Sattar had 
voluntarily given himself up before the Military Intelligence for 
accountability on the directives of the party.

He should have been produced before the magistrate within 24 hours, 
he said, adding that despite the passage of more than 48 hours he 
had neither been produced in the court for remand purpose, nor the 
authorities were saying anything about the charges against him.

"Dr Farooq Sattar is a heart patient and is also suffering from 
ulcer but permission is not being given to send him medicines," 
said Mr Shaikh, claiming that Dr Sattar was also not being allowed 
to meet his family and the lawyers.

He claimed that under the law and the Constitution the authorities 
could not keep any person in detention for more than 24 hours. They 
were bound to present him before a magistrate for seeking remand, 
which had not been done so far, he said.

He said that when the fundamental rights had not been suspended, 
this treatment with him was an "insult of the mandate the MQM 
enjoys."

Aftab Shaikh said that when he contacted Governor Azim Daudpota in 
this connection, he expressed his inability to allow Dr Sattar's 
family or lawyers to meet him at this stage.

He said that those who had plundered national wealth were given one 
month to clear their accounts, but Dr Sattar, an elected member and 
not included in the list of defaulters, was being treated in such a 
manner.

He deplored the manner in which the police had raided Dr Sattar's 
house, ransacked the place, arrested his private assistant and 
subjected them to torture, and declared Dr Sattar a proclaimed 
offender.

He demanded of the chief executive, General Pervez Musharraf, to 
purge the administration of such elements and to take notice of 
what he termed "illegal and unconstitutional" actions against Dr 
Farooq Sattar.

LAHORE, Nov 30: The Central Board of Revenue and many trade bodies

deadlock on the ticklish issue of levying the general sales tax at 
retail level. 

 Informed sources believe that the federal government will agree to 
some of traders' demands which had been rejected in the past 
including a crackdown on the trade of smuggled goods at busy 
markets in bargaining extension in the tax net. 

 Sources claimed that some military personnel had held detailed

<a name="265m">$265m debt rescheduling accord signed with Germany</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Nov 27: Pakistan on Saturday signed agreements with 
Germany and Norway for the rescheduling of its more than 265 
million dollars worth of loans, reports said.

The German government has agreed on extension periods of 18 to 20 
years with grace periods of three to 10 years on its $254-million 
loan.

The finance ministry initialed agreements with the Norwegian 
government for the rescheduling of an $11.63-million loan. The 
bilateral agreements were concluded under the Paris Club 
rescheduling process, which was agreed earlier this year with the 
facilitation of the IMF.

The accord with Germany applies to commercial credit claims, 
guaranteed by the German government, of $116 million and claims 
arising from Official Development Assistance (ODA) of $138 million. 
The interest rate for the ODA claims is a concessional low rate of 
1.75 per cent and the interest rate for the commercial credit 
claims is lower than the original ones.

The negotiations were led on the Pakistan side by Finance Secretary 
Javed Akram and on the German side by Dr Brenhard Ziese, director 
of the federal ministry of finance.

The agreement between Pakistan and Norway would be signed as soon 
as it was cleared by the government of Norway, it was officially 
announced here. Under the agreement debt service of $11.63 million 
would be consolidated and rescheduled for repayment in 30 semi-
annual installments commencing from July 2003. This amount was due 
between July 1, 1998 and Dec 31, 2000 on loans contracted up to 
Sept 30, 1997.-Agencies

<a name="bank">Bankers tracking defaulters' asset abroad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Nov 29: The recovery drive for the stuck up bank loans is 
not over, on expiry of Nov 16 deadline set by the Chief Executive 
General Musharraf and bankers report that efforts are still on to 
track down the assets of all 'wilful defaulters' and bad account 
holders within the country and outside.

Efforts are on to search the properties acquired by the 'wilful 
loan defaulters' in foreign countries and in Pakistan. Banks report 
revamping of their legal departments in Pakistan by way of engaging 
lawyers of repute and standing and doing away with those who were 
employed on recommendation of one ministry or the other. Banks now 
appear all set to effectively push forward their litigations 
against such bad account holders in the local courts.

Reports suggest that State Bank of Pakistan is also forming a 
committee of senior loan recovery officers of major banks to 
maintain the tempo of recovery drive and the government has been 
approached to frame foreclosure laws and improve the functioning of 
banking courts at lower and higher levels.

Simultaneously, the banks and the financial institutions are also 
digging deep into the files to find out those bankers and 
executives who were responsible for sanctioning and disbursement of 
loans without adequate safeguards. The fact that quite a good 
number of bankers and their children are running big business 
concerns in and outside Pakistan lends credence to the belief that 
many of them actually connived in sanctioning of such bad debts.

Two out of five top banks of the country have engaged foreign firms 
to track down the assets made by loan defaulters in Europe, USA and 
other countries and at least one - Habib Bank Limited - has 
reported some success in settling down one bad account after 
locating the property.

Shaukat Tarin, President of the HBL said that the company engaged 
by his bank has tracked down the property of a major business group 
in a European country and before the legal proceedings could be 
initiated the account holder himself approached the bank and agreed 
to settle the loan repayment.

Zubyr Soomro, President of the United Bank Limited said that his 
bank has also acquired the services of foreign firms to search for 
fixed and liquid assets of the loan defaulters in foreign 
countries.

These two top bankers of the leading government-controlled banks 
were of the view that there are strict laws in European countries 
and in USA against the corruption and on loan default and provide 
all opportunities for attachment of property, as well as punishment 
to those who are found guilty.

Zubyr Soomro specifically, mentioned the Moreva Injunction in 
Britain which substantially supports the aggrieved institutions to 
get back the amount lost to such loan defaulters, as well as to get 
them punished.

A sample survey of 68 selected textile mills in Pakistan carried 
out by a leading local private consultant firm during the exercise 
of a Coordination Committee of the State Bank of Pakistan in 1998 
has already found owners of seven mills not traceable and four 
others missing.

This list of missing loan defaulters include a former Chairman of 
the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association who as reported by the 
Pakistan Television in a news bulletin is running three hotels and 
one health centre in Britain.

Bankers say that when properties and liquid assets of high profile 
political personalities can be found out in Britain and in 
Switzerland, it should not be difficult to track down the assets of 
the big business groups and loan defaulters in foreign countries.

While the bankers are pretty confident of effectively pushing their 
efforts in foreign countries to get back the loan amounts from the 
defaulters they face serious problems at home because of a host of 
problems in the judicial system.

Bankers informed a World Bank team early this year that they could 
file cases for recovery of only 43 per cent of the non-performing 
loans till end 1998.

A report of the World Bank given to the ex-Governor State Bank of 
Pakistan Dr Muhammad Yaqub reveals that cases for the recovery of 
Rs62.86 billion out of total Rs146 billion non-performing loans 
were filed in the courts. The amount for which the cases were 
filed, was only 43 per cent of the total sum odd non-performing 
loans.

The World Bank report based on interviews with the judges and 
bankers blamed the lawyers of the banks for failing to pursue their 
cases skillfully. Bankers maintain that for quite a long time the 
lawyers were appointed from a list of the law minister or on 
recommendation.

"We have now revamped our legal department", Zubyr Soomro said who 
pointed out that UBL was employing the lawyers of professional 
standing. Other banks are also doing the same.

Amendments made in the loan recovery laws in 1997 are considered 
effective but banks face problems in obtaining decrees and then 
getting these decrees executed.

Statistics given to the World Bank team by the bankers showed they 
could obtain decrees only in 21 per cent of the cases filed by them 
in the courts till end 1998 for recovery of loans under Rs30 
million. All the five banks filed 37,868 cases till end 1998 for 
recovery of Rs11.6 billion of loans of less than Rs30 million. Out 
of these the banks could obtain 8,035 interim decrees for Rs2.7 
billion.

<a href="#eabb">EAB body proposes online banking, deregulation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Haris Anwar

 KARACHI, Dec 1: The sub-group of Economic Advisory Board on the 
Information Technology (IT) has recommended the government to force 
banks to go online for more efficient and transparent banking.

"The government should target at least 3000 branches to go online 
by the end of 2000, using data networks of PTCL and private 
sector," the group recommends. This move, the group feels, will 
result in the rapid growth of e-commerce in the country.

The group says if the PTCL privatization is not achieved by June 
2000, the government should deregulate the telecom sector for 
attracting more foreign investment.

To provide enabling conditions for internet growth, the group says, 
PTCL should bring down its charges for international bandwidth 
connection, access lines, and encourage the setting up of National 
Access Points and Peering Points by Internet Service Providers.

"The government will have to remove the obstacles in the growth of 
internet services as done in India where there is no license fee, 
royalties and other charges," it says. The group includes Aizaz 
Hussain, MD, System Private Ltd (chairman), Mian Javed, chairman, 
Pakistan Telecom Authority (PTA), Ansarul Haq, GM, CyberNet and 
others.

The group has also recommended the government to bring one ministry 
completely online to spread the use of modern technology in the 
public sector.

In order to increase the software export by small and medium size 
enterprises, the group members have stressed the need for providing 
overseas marketing support to these companies. "Export of IT 
services will not enhance unless an aggressive marketing campaign 
is undertaken in the target markets.

"Effective match making between local companies and foreign 
customers to boost Pakistan's share in this industry can thus be 
undertaken by Pakistan Software Export Board, which can act as a 

coordinator between local and foreign companies," the group 
recommends.

<a href="#over">'Over-staffing handicaps industrial growth'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec 2: Pakistan's industrial and commercial growth and 
export competitiveness are severely handicapped by weak and over-
staffed public sector institutions.

According to a latest World Bank study, this commercial and 
industrial growth has also been hampered by poorly targeted 
investments, neglect of essential highway maintenance, high 
transport costs, and poor safety standards.

The government plans to implement a 10 year National Highway 
Improvement Programme to improve public spending, increase 
maintenance components, introduce more private and road-user 
sources of financing, improve and commercialise road sector 
agencies, and to promote private sector provision and operation of 
highway-related services.

In the urban sector, the burgeoning urban population is growing at 
almost 5% annually and is outstripping the expansion of delivery of 
urban services. Improving water supply, sewerage systems, and solid 
waste management are important priorities for improving the 
situation. The government plans to undertake major reforms to 
development thecapacity of local governments to deliver better 
service, while encouraging private sector participation in urban 
service delivery.

About the Human Resource Development, the study said Pakistan's 
inability to develop its human capital has adversely affected 
medium term growth prospects as low levels of education and poor 
health constrain the growth of productivity throughout the economy. 
Despite some improvements over the past decade, social indicators, 
particularly for women, fall well short of those of other countries 
at a comparable stage of economic development.

Toimprove social indicators, the government launched the Social 
Action Programme (SAP) in 1992 to expand and improve the delivery 
of social services in elementary education, primary health, 
population welfare, and rural water supply and sanitation.The SAP, 
which has received wide financial support from the donor community, 
also strives to strengthen partnerships with non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs), the private sector, and local communities in 
development and delivery of social service programmes.

In Nov '97, the Bank approved a $285m credit for Pakistan's 
National Drainage Programme, which supports major policy and 
institutional reforms in the water sector.

In 2000, the Bank is planning to help promote policy reforms which 
will introduce agricultural income tax, restructure agricultural 
enterprises, and remove subsidies.

<a name="powe">Power purchase agreement can be re-written: Hubco</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Dec 2: Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) can be re-written in 
the interest of both Hub Power Co Ltd (Hubco) and Water and Power 
Development Authority (WAPDA) with 'mutual consent', said chief 
executive of the Company Khursheed Hussain.

'Hubco has suggested December 7 and 8 for meeting with WAPDA 
officials to restart negotiations on long standing power tariff 
issue. I am optimistic that the new government will not follow 
policy of previous government and the issue would be settled once 
and for all', said Khursheed while speaking with members of SITE 
Association of Industry Thursday.

He said present power tariff being charged by Hubco was 6.42 cents 
per unit which was 5.75 cents per unit and 6.03 per unit in '94 and 
'92 respectively. The increase was due to high price of furnace 
oil, rupee depreciation etc. Power tariff can be reduced if WAPDA 
start buying more power from Hubco.

Chairman SITE Association of Industry Abdullah Rafi asked the 
government to accord approval for Hubco to directly supply power to 
KESC on a priority basis and establish infrastructure so that 
industries in Karachi could have required and uninterrupted power 
supply.-PPI

<a name="econ">Economic agenda to focus on demand management</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Haris Anwar

KARACHI, Dec 2: The external side weaknesses are seen shaping new 
regime's economic agenda, sources said on Thursday.

"The emphasis will be more on the demand management as fragile 
external sector leaves a little room for the expansionary 
policies," a source involved in the policy-making said.

This scenario dampens the chances of an immediate stimulus to the 
economy as the government will try to contain the imports which 
result in a higher input cost to the manufacturing and services 
sectors, a source added.

When asked whether the government would be able to continue the 
previous government's programmes aimed at demand stimulus to the 
economy, the same source said a growth initiative that required an 
increase in imports was unlikely to be continued in the original 
form.

The previous government had announced some import concessions for 
the housing and transport schemes to stimulate sagging economic 
growth.

Pakistan's new regime faces an extremely unfavourable balance of 
payment situation. Adverse international prices of cotton and oil 
have threatened to increase the current account deficit.

The trade deficit for October has increased the trade gap to $ 587 
million in the first four months of fiscal 1999-200 against full 
year's target of $ 800 million.

Pakistan, currently enjoying debt relief by bilateral and 
commercial creditors, will have to reduce its current account 
deficit this year to be in a position to make normal and 
rescheduled payment by December 2000.

According the macroeconomic framework committee of the Economic 
Advisory Board, the GDP should be targeted to grow 5.2 per cent by 
the year 2002-2003 from 3.1 per cent in 1998-99 with an average 
growth rate of 4.5 per cent.

"This growth figure largely depends on the recovery in the 
agricultural sector as the chances of revival in the trade and 
manufacturing sector are dim in the near-term," another source 
said.

He said that the IMF mission, which was currently in Islamabad, was 
called to secure approval for the new economic agenda likely to be 
announced by the Chief Executive on Dec 15.

But economic experts involved in devising the policy framework for 
the new government have questioned the timing of the Mission's 
arrival, which, they say, cast doubts on the official claim that 
new economic agenda will be based on a homegrown programme.

<a name="cbrm">CBR may opt for limited scrutiny of taxpayers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, Nov 28: The Central Board of Revenue has decided to 
review the immunity to taxpayers from official scrutiny.

Official sources told Dawn here on Saturday that the immunity was 
causing huge revenue losses, and the present manner of selecting 
auditable individuals and companies was injecting corruption into 
the tax collecting machinery.

They added that the immunity from scrutiny had been in place since 
long, but it was being misconstrued and misused by many taxpayers.

Those taxpayers, they said, were applying evasive tactics by paying 
up marginal amounts, in additional to the tax payable by them, for 
attaining the immunity status, and were preventing the tax 
machinery to peep into their actual incomes and turnovers.

The CBR chairman, Riaz Hussain Naqvi, also hinted at removal of the 
immunity to taxpayers while briefing the trade bodies here on 
Saturday at the planning commission.

He explained that the concept of immunity of taxpayers from 
official scrutiny had to be discarded. He, however, said the extent 
of scrutiny should be limited and the selection for scrutiny should 
be on a random basis with the help of computers.

He said it should also be ensured that the audit of such selected 
taxpayers was conducted in a manner that there is no scope for 
harassment or extortion.

<a name="stoc">Stocks finish with extended gain</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 3: Stocks on Friday finished with an extended gain 
defying weekend selling as the strength of the leading base shares 
spilled over to other counters. The KSE 100-share index was up 5.06 
points at 1,260.89.

The news from Hubco about the proposed meeting in Islamabad and 
higher dividend announcements keep investors at their toes all the 
time as they could not precisely decide how to react to some 
positive developments.

But a leading stock analyst Faisal Abbas is not that optimistic 
about next chart point of 1,300 for the KSE 1index, basing his 
assessment largely on technical factors.

'The index could beat a hasty retreat after touching the high mark 
of 1,275.00', he claims adding 'most of the leading local investors 
and foreign funds may take profit after it touches the target of 
1,270, the point where 10% profit margin will mature'.

But stock analysts at the KASB & co think otherwise saying the 
market is in for a grand technical rebound as its most pressing 
irritants are fading out by each day.

The KSE 100-share index finished higher by 5.06 points at 1,260.89 
as compared to 1,255.83 a day earlier, adding Rs2bn to the market 
capitalisation at Rs341.00bn.

News of a meeting between Hubco and WAPDA officials on Dec 7 and 8 
in Islamabad could trigger a lot speculative buying on selected 
counters by the next week adding new element to stock trading.

'What seems to have raised hopes of an imminent settlement of the 
30-month old tariff dispute is the indication from the Hubco chief 
that the tariff could be lowered but he did not specify the rate of 
cut', analyst Muhammad Ashraf said.

'We can cut the current tariff by 20% after capacity utilisation 
touch the high mark of 85%', he said adding 'indications are that 
of the scene deal has been reached with the new regime and it will 
be formalised in the scheduled meeting'.

Floor brokers said the trading next week will remain focused on the 
Hub-Power share, which still ruling at an attractively lower level 
of Rs20.50 after having fallen from the peak of Rs60.00 two years 
back when the tariff cut dispute started.

The weekend selling was well-absorbed at the decline as investors 
are not inclined to entertain bearish ideas at least for the near-
term amid encouraging dividend news pouring in daily, they added.

Broader market performed well as most of the leading shares in the 
bank, energy and textiles shares finished with an extended gain 
amid active trading volumes.

Plus signs again dominated the list under the lead of Dewan Khalid 
Textiles, Kohinoor Weaving. Lafayette Industries, Ishaq Textiles, 
Knoll, Sitara Chemical Shafi Chemical and Cherat Papersack, which 
posted gains ranging from Rs2.00 to Rs5.00.

They were followed by PSO, Bolan Casting, Dawood Hercules, 13th 
ICP, Wah-Noble Chemicals, and Al-Meezan Fund, rising by one rupee 
to Rs1.40.

BOC Pakistan, which has been in strong demand for the last couple 
of sessions in anticipation of higher dividend came in for active 
selling at the higher levels, falling by Rs6.25 followed by Shell 
Pakistan, Millat Tractors, Central Insurance and Packages, which 
suffered decline ranging from Rs1.20 to Rs1.75.

Trading volume further rose to 125 shares from the previous 100m 
shares as leading speculators kept to the sidelines owing partly to 
weekend considerations. Gainers led losers by 111 to 63, with 54 
shares holding on to the last levels.

The most active list was again topped by Hub-Power, up 25 paisa at 
Rs20.80 on 40m shares followed by PSO, higher Rs1.35 at Rs144.50 on 
18m shares, PTCL, unchanged on 16m shares, ICI Pakistan, unchanged 
at Rs9.35 on 9m shares and Japan Power, up 45 paisa at Rs545 on 5m 
shares.

The persistent buying in it is attributed to reports that it will 
start commercial production during the next two weeks.

Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, 
firm 15 paisa on 5m shares, Fauji Fertiliser, steady by five paisa 
also on 5m shares, Bank of Punjab, up 80 paisa on 3m shares, Askari 
Bank, higher 90 paisa on 3m shares, Adamjee Insurance, lower 25 
paisa also on 3m shares, Dewan Salman,, easy 15 paisa on 2m shares 
and D.G.Khan cement, up 40 paisa on 2m shares.

DIVIDEND: Shezan International cash 50% and Capital Asset Bank cash 
five per cent for the year ended June 30, '99.

BOARD MEETINGS: Mandviwala Mauser Plastic, BOC Pakistan, Valika Art 
Fabrics on Dec 7, Kohinoor Energy, PEL Appliances, Pak Elektron and

<a name="stom">Storming of the Supreme Court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee 

AN affidavit in the case of the storming of the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan (Cr.Appeal 162/99 arising out of Cr.Misc.27/98) was sworn 
on November 27, 1999, and placed on record in the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan :

"I, Ardeshir Cowasjee, son of Rustom Fakirjee Cowasjee, resident of 
10 Mary Road, Karachi, do hereby place on record a letter dated 
November 26, 1999, written by me to Mr Aziz Munshi, the Attorney 
General of Pakistan:

"Dear Mr Attorney-General

"1) It is not necessary for me to remind you -

-That no democracy can survive without checks and balances, 
institutional or otherwise.

-That the last sham democracy we have suffered, imposed upon us by 
Mian Nawaz Sharif, has destroyed all but one institution of state 
capable of checking his megalomania, his avarice for pelf and 
power, and his abuse of power.

-That when institutions are corrupted, in the eyes of the people 
those who corrupt as well as those who tamely allow themselves to 
be corrupted are all equally culpable. However, a megalomaniac must 
be deemed to be less culpable than those who profess to be burdened 
by the halos they wear.

- That in order to protect itself when in the wrong, one 
institution, misusing its power, has been known to employ 
intimidatory measures against another institution. Case in point : 
excised by the editor (self-censorship) from my Dawn column of 
28/12/97 (Fascism on the march-IV) : "Is there any reasonable man 
in Pakistan prepared to believe that three honourable judges of the 
Supreme Court, Justices Irshad Hasan Khan, Nasir Aslam Zahid, and 
Khalilur Rahman, sitting in far away Quetta in the month of 
November, were capable of acting as they did on their own ? What 
transpired in cold Quetta and the repercussions thereafter, which 
defy logic and reason, is a story that will haunt our superior 
judiciary for years to come." When I brought this to the attention 
of the then law minister, Khalid Anwer, his comment was : "Since I 
have no desire to see you hauled up under our antiquated and 
irrational law of contempt, I can only applaud your editor's 
discretion."

"2) Whilst investigating a crime, it is vital to the case to look 
into its background and the motives which prompted the crime."3)
	Instigated, supported and aided by the leaders of the 
Pakistan Muslim League (N) party then in power, legislators, party 
members and street activists of the party stormed the Supreme Court 
on November 28, 1997, committing the gravest contempt in the face 
of the court in judicial history. The president of the ruling 
party, Nawaz Sharif, and his dastardly aides committed the crime 
with impunity, safe in their knowledge that no court in the country 
would convict them.

"4) The run-up to the disgraceful storming began in August 1997, 
when CJP Sajjad Ali Shah recommended the names of the five senior-
most high court judges for elevation to the SC. The filling of the 
five vacant positions was long overdue. The government response to 
the request was to issue a notification reducing the strength of SC 
judges from 17 to 12.

"5) Early in September 1997, the Supreme Court Bar Association 
challenged this reduction and the SC admitted its petition. The 
Court suspended the notification, which was withdrawn by the 
government, but which held the appointment of the five judges in 
abeyance. The government subsequently backed down and the petition 
was disposed of.

"6) On October 9, 1997, CJP Shah flew to Saudi Arabia. The next 
day, Acting Chief Jusitce Ajmal Mian claimed that he had not been 
consulted on the elevation of the five judges. Eight other Supreme 
Court judges sent him a requisition for the convening of a full-
court meeting to discuss the matter. ACJ Mian gave notice for such 
a meetting to be held on the 13th of the month.

"7)CJP Shah flew back on the 13th and cancelled the full-court 
meeting.

"8) On October 17, seven judges of the SC asked CJP Shah to convene 
a full-court meeting. He rejected their requisition.

"9) On October 20, in an unprecedented move, five judges of the SC 
addressed a letter to CJP Shah challenging his appointment and 
released to the press the text of their letter.

"10) On October 25, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan challenged the 14th 
Amendment and on October 29 a bench of the SC passed an interim 
order suspending the amendment, terming it 'anti-dissent'. That 
same day a joint parliamentary group declared - verbal war on the 
superior judiciary, the prime minister calling the suspension 
'unconstitutional' and several of his parliamentarians from the 
floor of the National Assembly condemning in violent language the 
action of the CJP.

"11) On October 30, a Bench of the Supreme Court passed an order 
invoking Article 190 of the Constitution and requested President 
Farooq Leghari to appoint the five judges to the five vacant 
positions. The president warned the government that he may be 
compelled to do so, whereupon the prime minister backed down and 
agreed to the elevations.

"12) On October 31, a petition was filed challenging the 13th 
Amendment, and contempt petitions were also filed against the prime 
minister and seven other parliamentarians.

"13) On November 3, the SC issued pre-contempt notices to the prime 
minister, to the law minister, to five other parliamentarians, and 
to the editors of three newspapers. Barrister S M Zafar appeared 
for the PM and sought one month's time to prepare and file his 
written statement. He was given one week.

"14) On November 12, contempt notices were issued to the PM and the 
others asking them to appear and to file their written replies.

"15) On November 14, Information Minister Mushahid Hussain 
announced that the PM had decided to make a personal appearance in 
the SC which he duly did on November 17.

"16) On the night of November 17-18, at a post-midnight session, 
the National Assembly passed a bill amending the contempt of court 
law, allowing an intra-court appeal to 'the remaining judges' 
against a Supreme Court show-cause notice or conviction for 
contempt of court.

"17) On the morning of November 18, an SC bench in Quetta (JJ Nasir 
Aslam Zahid, Irshad Hassan Khan and Khalilur Rehman Khan ) admitted 
a petition challenging the appointment of the CJP and asking that 
he convene a full court to decide the matter.

"18) On November 19, the PM publicly criticized President Farooq 
Leghari for delaying the signing of the Contempt of Court 
(Amendment) Bill. On the 20th, Leghari issued a statement saying he 
would not sign the bill on the insistence of one man; the SC heard 
petitions challenging the bill, and issued an interim order asking 
the president not to sign the bill, which, if already signed, would 
be considered suspended. To this, the PML(N) parliamentary group 
demanded the impeachment of the president, the cabinet approved, 
signatures were sought, and the decision taken to give notice at 
that evening's Senate session.

"19) On November 21, the SC issued a notice to the government in 
the 13th amendment case and refused to grant interim relief. The 
hearing was adjourned to the 27th.

"20) On the night of November 25, Senator R.A.Tarar, was sent in a 
special flight to Quetta to use his persuasive powers on the SC 
judges sitting there. On November 26, two members of the Quetta 
bench of the SC (JJ Irshad Hasan Khan and Khalilur Rahman Khan) 
issued an interim order suspending CJP Shah, challenging his out-
of-turn elevation, and restraining him from the performance of his 
functions. CJP Shah termed this order illegal. (The order was 
signed that night by the third member of the Quetta Bench, Justice 
Nasir Aslam Zahid, who was out of Quetta when the order was 
issued.)

"21) On November 27, a bench of five judges of the SC at Islamabad 
anulled the verdict of the Quetta bench. PML(N) parliamentarians 
and activists present in the courtroom insulted and heckled the 
judges, refused to accept the authority of the court, shouting that 
'Sajjad Ali Shah' had no right to be there as he had been 
suspended. That same day, a two-member Peshawar bench of the SC (JJ 
Saeeduzaman Siddiqui and Fazal Illahi Khan) called for a full-court 
bench to decide the matter of the validity of the CJP's 
appointment.

"22) On the night of November 27-28, having completed all 
arrangements for transporting a mob of PML(N) workers and activists 
from various areas of the Lahore region, Senator Saifur Rahman and 
Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif flew into Islamabad from 
Lahore in the CM's special plane.

"23) At 0700 on the morning of November 28, Lt-General Rana, then 
heading the ISI, informed COAS General Jehangir Karamat that a mob 
had been organized to raid the SC whilst the contempt case against 
prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, was being heard. You, I, and the 
world at large know well the sordid details of the demeaning and 
shameful events that followed on that day of November 28, 1997.

"May I suggest, now that the storming case has been reopened, that 
in addition to those already summoned, President Tarar, Shahbaz 
Sharif, Saifur Rehman, former CJP Sajjad Ali Shah, former President 
Leghari and Lt-General Rana, all be called to give evidence.

"The Court was stormed two years ago on November 28, 1997. The 
verdict in the contempt case, acquitting the few insignificant 
members of the storming party who had been charged, was given on 
May 14, 1999, over 500 days later. We must hope that the rehearing 
of this case will be completed expeditiously."

Ayaz Amir

A REVOLUTIONARY order, one which upsets everything and leads to the 
emergence of something entirely new, is its own justification. For 
its legitimacy it needs no sanction from any supreme court. Lenin 
went before no chief justice after the Bolshevik Revolution. Nor 
did Mustafa Kemal or, nearer to our own time, the Ayatollah 
Khomeini after the Iranian revolution.

The English-speaking coup, on the other hand, which because of our 
collective sins is the phenomenon whose fourth incarnation we are 
currently seeing in Pakistan, is the very antithesis of a 
revolutionary order. The reason for this is simple. Not only in 
Pakistan but in all ex-British colonies, the English-speaking coup 
flows from an institution which is one of the pillars of 
conservatism and tradition.

Let us not forget that the most enduring legacies of our colonial 
experience are: the English language, the trappings of democracy, 
the notion (if no more) of the rule of law, and armies structured 
on the English pattern complete with mess ceremonial, swagger 
sticks and batmen. Small wonder then if, as far as tradition is 
concerned, there is more in common between the Pakistan and Indian 
armies than, say, the armies of Pakistan and Iran.

Being therefore a mainstay of the status quo, and indeed one of its 
principal beneficiaries, the army can no more shatter or even upset 
the status quo than a college of cardinals can be expected to move 
against the Holy See. This is not to say that the officer corps is 
not concerned about the country or is not upset when politicians 

make a mess of things. Army officers, especially when they are 
young, in their innocence and enthusiasm get very upset indeed. But 
to remedy this situation they do not rush to the collected works of 
Ho Chi Minh or Che Guevara. Their instinct is to bring to the 
complexities of the political situation the certainties of the 
parade ground. And since on the parade ground everything slovenly 
or wrong can be set right usually by shouting the appropriate 
orders, the temptation is to think that in politics too there is 
nothing that cannot be set right with a bit of discipline and 
military rigour.

Every military government in Pakistan has suffered from this 
approach and General Pervez Musharraf's government is no exception. 
The latter has made an example of a few people - the defaulters put 
in prison - which is exactly what Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan did in 
their time. Ayub threw the country's leading politicians out of the 
political arena and launched a noisy drive against smugglers and 
black-marketeers. Yahya threw hundreds of civil servants out of 
their jobs. In both cases after the dust had settled it was 
business as usual. General Musharraf is from the same army and heir 
to the same tradition. It takes a leap of faith to suppose that the 
current accountability drive - now sputtering, now coming alive in 
fitful spasms - can pose a serious threat to the standing and 
privileges of the country's elite classes. At the risk of sounding 
faintly ridiculous, this is not, nor can ever be, a Khomeinite 
revolution.

General Musharraf and his colleagues, therefore, should tailor 
their rhetoric to the limitations of where they come from. Since 
they are not French or Bolshevik revolutionaries and since smashing 
the status quo is neither on their agenda nor indeed in their 
vision of things, it follows that the utmost they can hope for is 
(1) to undertake the necessary surgery to lance out the more 
conspicuous pimples and carbuncles which spoil the face of Pakistan 
and (2) to help create an enabling environment for the restoration 
of democracy. If General Musharraf succeeds in bringing about just 
this and no more he will have earned a place for himself in 
Pakistan's history. If, however, through a combination of bad 
advice and megalomania (both qualities of autocratic rule) he goes 
beyond these basic aims and starts thinking of himself as a de 
Gaulle or an Ataturk he will be repeating the mistakes of his 
predecessors.

In the aftermath of October 12 it is a strange sight to see 
perfectly sane people go into hysterics the moment democracy is 
mentioned. "You want to return to Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif?" 
they heatedly ask. In their indignation they tend to ignore the 
fact that our country was the product of a political process 
spearheaded by a strong-willed and clear-headed man called Mohammad 
Ali Jinnah. Pakistan was not the result of a military conquest; the 
army, or for that matter the bureaucracy, had nothing to do with 
its making.

For better or worse therefore keeping the political process alive 
is a matter of necessity for us even if from time to time inept and 
corrupt figures blight the political landscape. Consider this 
analogy. On the battle-field the record of the Pakistan army, which 
has had its shares of defeats and disasters, has not been uniformly 
glorious. Should this mean we call for disbanding the army? In the 
same manner even if an entire generation of politicians is guilty 
of crooked behaviour it should not mean we pack up the entire 
baggage of democracy.

Of course ordinary people in their frustration look to quick-gun 
solutions. They expect an end to poverty, injustice and 
unemployment and think that hanging a few people from the nearest 
lamp-post will do the trick and push Pakistan into the light. All 
this is over-simplistic melodrama. But at the moment it is not very 
popular to try to see things against the backdrop of our history.

Whenever we have had military rule what has happened is that after 
a few spectacular moves like the current arrests of defaulters 
routine and inertia take over. While the army command, with the 
help of the bureaucracy, exercises political power, the economy is 
left to be managed by 'technocrats' usually with strong links to 
the financial powerhouses in Washington. Shaukat Aziz is not the 
first of this kind. From Muhammad Shoaib in Ayub Khan's time there 
have been others before him. The day-to-day running of the 
administration is left to the bureaucracy without any interaction 
from public representatives.

In the beginning this arrangement looks geared to the conduct of 
efficient business. Very soon, however, the bureaucracy becomes 
more and more aloof from the people. The regime as a whole becomes 
inward-looking with all thought of reform sacrificed at the altar 
of political survival. This was the pattern in the past and it 
looks likely to be repeated in the absence of institutional reform 
- reform of the courts, the criminal justice system and the police. 
The army is not fully qualified to understand the necessity of this 
reform. The bureaucracy has an interest in blocking it. We will 
therefore be left with gimmicks such as the so-called monitoring 
mechanism set up by the present regime. All it is doing is to salve 
the army's conscience without having the slightest effect on the 
running or efficiency of the general administration.

It is not a little odd therefore to hear General Musharraf repeat 
his mantra at every conceivable opportunity about sham and real 
democracy. Since the logic of power cannot be denied, the army as 
the country's most powerful institution will continue to exercise 
direct or indirect political influence for the foreseeable future. 
So for army commanders to want to look periodically like statesmen 
and reformers should not be surprising. All the same, the officer 
corps should not forget that the army's basic task is soldiering, a 
difficult enough business in any case, while government is best 
left to the people's chosen representatives even if the currency of 
public representation looks soiled for the moment.

If distortions arise in the political process, as they have arisen 
in Pakistan from the Zia era till today, the army should help 

correct them and then, its short task completed, it should go back 
to the barracks. When instead of this it assumes the mantle of 
messiahdom (as it stands in danger of doing at present) and starts 
liking the feel of the new fit, its own professionalism is affected 
and the national polity is further distorted. We cannot afford to 
see this pattern repeated.

Irfan Husain

THE scenes from Seattle were reminiscent of the anti-Vietnam war 
protests that swept the United States in the sixties and early 
seventies and finally brought that conflict to an end.

Whatever the outcome of the WTO talks, one thing is certain: the 
official agenda has been successfully hijacked by the odd alliance 
of trade unionists, environmentalists, students and anarchists who 
briefly ruled the streets of Seattle. One group conspicuous by its 
absence was that of representatives of developing nations, although 
they will be the biggest losers if the US and the European Union 
get their way.

Indeed, ever since the World Trade Organization came into being in 
1995 as the successor to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), there has been relative apathy in the Third World to the 
implications of the agreement signed by 130 members of the WTO. We 
have been particularly laggard in focusing on the key provisions of 
the agreement that affect Pakistan directly. Instead of co-
ordinating with similarly placed countries, we have been locked in 
our sordid little world of politics and corruption. The result is a 
total lack of preparation in adjusting to a more open and liberal 
international trading system.

The implications of the Seattle talks are far-reaching and will 
touch the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world. 
Consumers, farmers and manufacturers will all be affected to 
varying degrees. Unfortunately, developing countries have woken up 
to these coming changes rather late, thus failing to evolve a 
common platform and strategy for Seattle. Luckily for them, 
American protesters have taken up their cause.

So what has ignited the protests in Seattle? Basically, the WTO is 
different thing to different groups. It offers vast opportunities 
to multinationals as well as efficient (and often subsidized) 
farmers, while spelling doom to inefficient manufacturers and small 
farmers. And it will deal a heavy blow to nations that turn a blind 
eye to child labour and indulge in gender discrimination as well as 
environmental damage. In brief, countries like Pakistan will derive 
few benefits while standing to be the biggest losers from trade 
liberalization.

As custom duties head towards zero in most categories of goods by 
2005, our manufacturers will face increasing competition from 
imports that will be both cheaper and of better quality. Our 
farmers will be unable to compete with produce from Europe and 
America that is grown on huge, mechanized and massively subsidized 

farms. It is true that Pakistani customers will benefit from 
greater choice, lower prices and better quality. However, this 
increase in imports will result in higher trade deficits and a fall 
in the value of the rupee. Ultimately, the economy will come under 
intolerable strain as many manufacturers and farmers face ruin.

When the WTO came into being in 1995, member states had a decade to 
make the structural adjustments needed to bring their economies 
into line with the requirements of free trade. However, successive 
Pakistani governments since then remained blind to the need to gear 
up the economy, and our manufacturers, spoiled by decades of 
subsidies and official pampering, did not put in the investments 
and hard work necessary to increase efficiency and quality.

None of this is to suggest that trade liberalization is not a good 
thing. All things being equal, it brings about a better deal for 
the consumer and provides manufacturers a level playing field to 
compete on. But in real life, things are seldom equal. For years, 
multinationals have employed lawyers specializing in international 
trade to draft provisions that benefit them, and these clauses are 
then placed in the working papers of governments that spearhead the 
cause of these giant corporations. Manufacturers in developed 
countries are far more efficient than those in developing 
countries, and generally enjoy greater economies of scale. Farmers 
in the West are generally subsidized and produce food far in excess 
of national requirements; much of this excess is exported to the 
rest of the world at prices that small farmers elsewhere cannot 
match.

Before the GATT and the WTO, countries protected their own 
interests through high tariff barriers and restrictive import 
policies. However, this will no longer be possible. For instance, 
the governments of Pakistan and India will not be able to restrict 
imports from each other without attracting severe penalties. 
Indeed, this policy of cutting our noses to spite our faces has 
always been incomprehensible to me: both nations prefer paying far 
higher prices in importing goods and services from the rest of the 
world rather than trading directly with each other.

According to Third World critics of the WTO agreements, the whole 
thing is a western conspiracy to further impoverish poor countries. 
But while we demand greater access and lower tariffs on our exports 
to the richest markets in the world, we are unwilling to grant 
similar access to their products. However, the fact remains that 
the present system of international trade is tilted in favour of 
the developed countries: currently, tariffs on imports from the 
least developed countries are 30% higher than on imports from 
developed nations. Indeed, according to an Oxfam estimate, trade 
barriers are costing developing countries up to $700 billion 
annually through lost exports.

International trade is now a far bigger factor in the global 
economy than it was fifty years ago, having increased fourteen 
times since 1950 to $6,500 billion in 1997. Twentysix per cent of 
the world economy now is directly linked to international trade as 
compared to eight per cent in 1950. Clearly, then, there is a 
growing need to regulate this burgeoning commerce and protect 
groups and countries unable to withstand the growing power of 
multinationals. However, there is a real danger of the WTO becoming 
a handmaiden of western interests, much as the United Nations has. 
The fact that developing nations have so far not played an active 
role in the GATT and the WTO negotiations is one reason they are in 
the very real danger of being marginalized even further in the 
world economy.

For Pakistan, the problem is that our politicians, planners and 
businessmen have still not grasped the opportunities and dangers of 
globalization. With a largely illiterate workforce, a poor work 
ethic, a ramshackle physical and social infrastructure, outmoded 
management and a corrupt bureaucracy, there is just no way we can 
compete in the global marketplace without following protectionist 
policies. And these policies are about to be scrapped under the WTO 
agreement we are signatory to.

The name of the game now is 'sink or swim', and there is no 
indication that we are taking any swimming lessons.

<a name="paki">Pakistan's show below par against Australia: Wasim</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

LAHORE, Dec 2: A below par performance in all departments of the 
game brought 0-3 whitewash of the Pakistan cricket team in Test 
series in Australia.

Talking to mediamen here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Thursday, Wasim 
Akram admitted that the Pakistani bowlers, including himself, 
failed to bowl at length and to good direction which helped the 
Australians play their strokes freely.

The Pakistani captain said that the team-management kept on 
advising Shoaib Akhtar to maintain good line and length rather than 
generating extra-pace unnecessarily but he could not come up to 
expectations. However, Shoaib Akhtar had learnt a lot by playing in 
Australia but his inaccuracy cost the team dearly.

Replying to a question about giving more chances to Shoaib Akhtar 
in preference to the experienced paceman Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram 
said: "We want to give more chances to youngsters in preference to 
seasoned campaigners, keeping in view the future needs of the 
Pakistan team".

Wasim Akram rejected the allegation of Shoaib Akhtar's bowling 
action being "doubtful". He termed it as "perfect".

However, Wasim expressed his sorrow and indignation over statement 
of former national coach and Test all-rounder Wasim Hasan Raja, who 
had termed the express delivery of Shoaib Akhtar as "doubtful".

"Pakistan Cricket Board must take a bold stand before the 
International Cricket Council (ICC) in this regard and fully 
support Shoaib Akhtar. The rivals are trying to discourage young 
bowlers through such tactical moves", said Wasim Akram. Replying to 
another question about not giving any chance to Ghulam Ali during 
the three Test series, Wasim said that the opener was a second 
choice. Wajahatullah Wasti had played very well in a three-day 
practice match, therefore he was preferred over Ghulam Ali.

Skipper Wasim said that Aamir Sohail could be considered for 
selection in the Pakistan team for the forthcoming triangular one-
day series also involving Australia and India if he performed well 
during the current domestic cricket season.

"I have a couple of batsmen in mind who needed to be given a chance 
during the limited-over series in Australia. They are presently 
playing either for the Pakistan under-19 team or for the Pakistan 
Reserve team. But I will not like to disclose their names at the 
moment", emphasised Wasim Akram.

<a name="aust">Australia accomplish a 3-0 clean sweep of series against Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

PERTH, Nov 28: Australia, spurred by a vintage performance from 
Glenn McGrath, completed a 3-0 series clean sweep over Pakistan 
with victory by an innings and 20 runs in the third and final Test 
on Sunday.

Pakistan, 296 behind on first innings, were bowled out in their 
second innings for 276 before tea on the third day, giving 
Australia their first series whitewash against Pakistan in 27 years 
since Ian Chappell's team overwhelmed Intikhab Alam's tourists.

McGrath finished with four for 49 after an inspired display on a 
typically bouncy WACA pitch. The lanky strike bowler has been below 
his best in this series but produced a high-class piece of bowling 
here to seal Australia's win.

He dispatched Inzamam-ul-Haq (8) and Yousuf Youhana (0) before 
lunch, then added the scalp of Moin Khan (26), having dismissed 
Wajahatullah Wasti on Saturday. Saqlain, whose place at the crease 
was taken by Inzamam, was only able to bat again at the fall of 
seventh wicket.

The only Pakistanis to offer any real resistance were their number 
three Ijaz Ahmed, who scored a defiant 115, and captain Wasim 
Akram, who made 52 from just 40 balls. Ijaz, who also scored 82 in 
the second Test in Hobart, reached his 12th Test century and his 
sixth against Australia off just 138 balls.

Ijaz played a powerful innings as his team mates fell by the 
wayside. He scored freely on the lightening-fast outfield before 
being caught by Michael Slater in the deep after a mis-timed pull 
off Michael Kasprowicz with the total 230.

Akram made his seventh Test half-century with a typically carefree 
display, hitting nine boundaries in his 71-minute innings before he 
skied a catch to McGrath at deep mid-off off Kasprowicz. 
Kasprowicz, playing his first Test in over a year, picked up three 
late wickets to finish with seven for the match.

Damien Fleming took two for 86 and Shane Warne, whose leg spin is 
far less effective on the WACA, also chipped in with the wicket of 
Azhar Mahmood, bowled for 17.

match after his outstanding 197, which followed three successive 
ducks in the series.-Reuters/AFP

<a name="erup">Controversy erupts again over Shoaib's action</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

PERTH, Nov 30: Pakistan's cricket tour of Australia ended here on 
Tuesday just as it began five weeks ago, on a bitter note, with 
fresh suggestions the world's fastest bowler, Shoaib Akhtar, may 
have an illegal action.

As the touring party prepared to fly home after being trounced 3-0 
in the Test series, the Pakistan management was seething over 
newspaper allegations the 24-year-old could be a "chucker".

But tour manager Yawar Saeed defiantly declared Shoaib would return 
to Australia for the January-February triangular one-day series 
against Australia and India unless the International Cricket 
Council (ICC) intervened.

The Pakistanis are angry and confused over reports in two Rupert 
Murdoch-owned News Limited papers that a video of his bowling 
action - captured during the three Tests - will be sent to the ICC 
this week for scrutiny.

The reports in The Australian and The Daily Telegraph did not say 
who would send the video and an accompanying request for a review 
of Shoaib's action to the ICC. Neither paper gave direct quotes nor 
indicated where the reports had come from.

However, Daily Telegraph reported a videotape containing footage of 
his bowling in the three Tests against Australia would be sent to 
the ICC along with an official request that Shoaib's action be 
reviewed.

The area of concern is Shoaib's faster ball, clocked at more than 
154 kilometres per hour (97 mph) this month, rather than his 
routine delivery.

The papers suggested the video could be sent by Reid or one of the 
two umpires in the final Test. Peter Willey of England and 
Australian Darrell Hair stood in the Perth Test, which Australia 
won by an innings and 20 runs.

If the reports are correct, a nine-man ICC sub-committee, which 
examines suspect bowling actions, could recommend Shoaib change his 
controversial slingshot bowling style.

And that could mean the paceman missing the lucrative one-day 
series starting on Jan 9.

Yawar told The Australian newspaper he was unaware of any problem 
regarding Shoaib.

"It's not been brought to my notice by anyone," he said.
