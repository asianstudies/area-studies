<a name="paki">Pakistan calls for troop cut in Kashmir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Feb 24: Pakistan on Wednesday urged India to reduce 
troops' concentration in held Kashmir, give human rights to the 
people and allow Kashmiri leadership to visit Pakistan as part of 
the confidence building measures (CBMs) towards normalization of 
ties between the two countries.
    
"The CBMs being undertaken by Pakistan and India will not be 
complete unless similar measures are taken in held Kashmir like 
thinning out of troops, reduction of repression and permission to 
leaders of All Parties Hurriyat Conference to visit Pakistan," 
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz told reporters at the Foreign Office.
    
"I hope India will respond to it," he said.
    
Aziz said India had accepted the reality that solution of Kashmir 
issue was vital for the normalization of relations between New 
Delhi and Islamabad. "It is for the first time that India has shown 
willingness to discuss Kashmir issue," he said in reference to the 
various statements by Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee 
during his recent visit to Lahore.
    
When asked at what level the nuclear-related issues would be 
discussed by the two sides, the minister said peace and security 
were part of the agenda for the secretary-level talks.
    
Earlier, Mr Aziz told a press conference on the outcome of Nawaz-
Vajpayee summit that it was for the first time India had agreed to, 
"seriously discuss the issue," of Kashmir.
    
He said the UN Security Council resolutions were the basic 
framework seeking the settlement of Kashmir issue. "But this is the 
beginning," and it was too early to make prediction.
    
Aziz said it was not only India and Pakistan but international 
community too, had promised Kashmiris, their right to self-
determination.
    
Both India and Pakistan, he said, agreed during Nawaz-Vajpayee 
summit to notify each other before carrying out ballistic missiles 
tests.-APP
    
CTBT: To a question about CTBT, Aziz reiterated Pakistan was ready 
to adhere to the treaty by September 1999 in an atmosphere free of 
coercion and sanctions adding the process has begun with partial 
lifting of sanctions by the US.
    
Asked if Pakistan would adhere to the treaty before India did it, 
he said Islamabad's position on the issue was not linked with New 
Delhi. He said even if Pakistan signed CTBT, it would not prevent 
us from computer simulation tests.
    
NPT: Aziz said that the signing of Nuclear Proliferation Treaty 
(NPT) was not under debate because it recognized only five 
countries as nuclear powers.
    
"There is no question of it because we cannot join NPT as a non-
nuclear power and in the present shape of NPT, only five countries 
are nuclear powers and they do not accept others", he said in a 
telephonic interview with Voice of America (VOA).
    
"Therefore, either they amend the treaty and allow us entry as 
nuclear power, then we may join. But the signing of NPT is not 
under debate as yet", he added.
    
SECRETARY-LEVEL TALKS: Aziz said next round of Pakistan-India 
foreign secretary-level talks would be held either by end of March 
or early April to discuss priority issues of peace and security.
    
"Foreign ministers of the two countries will meet within one month 
after foreign secretary level talks to review progress achieved 
during the talks on all agenda items", he said.
    
Asked if the foreign ministers would also discuss matters relating 
to minimum credible nuclear deterrence, he said they would review 
the progress.
    
He did not agree with a questioner that talks between the two 
countries was a zero-sum game. "I do not agree to this contention 
as both the sides especially India has now agreed to move ahead. 
But this is impossible till issue of Kashmir is resolved and the 
Indians have decided to find out a solution to the problem."
    
When asked about the role of Atomic Energy Commission in the talks, 
he said they basically dealt with the things relating to safety 
arrangements but the issues relating to FMCT, deployment of weapons 
and export controls would be discussed by the officials and 
political leadership.
    
Asked if Prime Minister Sharif would also reciprocate Indian 
premier's gesture and visit India, he briefly said "not yet".
    
Aziz said that once political process was started in Jammu and 
Kashmir and right to self-determination was given to the people 
they would not take up arms.

The Simla Agreement, he said, did contain an affirmation for the 
settlement of the Kashmir dispute, but no mechanism for it had been 
proposed. Now under the agreement reached between the premiers the 
process towards resolving the outstanding issues had been 
undertaken which would be kept under review from time to time by 
the foreign ministers of the two countries, Aziz said.
    
To a question he said Pakistan had sought advice and assistance 
from the International Atomic Energy Agency and some European 
governments to devise safety measures for its nuclear programmes.

<a name="decl">Declaration termed milestone: No concessions made at summit: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: The Foreign Office on Monday categorically 
asserted that Pakistan made no "hidden commitment or understanding" 
in the summit meeting between prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Atal 
Behari Vajpayee.
    
A Foreign Office spokesman declared whatever had transpired in 
conversations between the two leaders was "up-front and brought in 
the open" in the three documents issued at the end of the two-day 
summit on Sunday.
    
In an unscheduled briefing to newsmen, Foreign Office spokesman 
Tariq Altaf expressed strong resentment at what he believed 
unfounded reports or misgivings about the Sharif-Vajpayee talks on 
a whole range of issues with Kashmir dispute occupying the central 
position in the parleys.
    
The spokesman maintained that no concessions were made in the 
summit. Whatever commitment had been made or whatever was done or 
agreed upon, he emphatically said, was done in the supreme national 
interest.
    
Refuting the suggestion that nuclear issue overshadowed the Kashmir 
issue in the talks, the spokesman declared "Kashmir is central and 
fundamental to peace and security and full normalization (of 
relations) as it was and will always remain so".
    
He said what was important and substantial was that the Indian 
Prime Minister by signing the Declaration conceded that Jammu and 
Kashmir had been a dispute.
    
He recalled that 10 years ago the then Indian Prime Minister (Rajiv 
Gandhi) when asked by newsmen about the Kashmir dispute, said for 
all purposes and content, it was no dispute.
    
Highlighting the importance of the Lahore Declaration, the FO 
spokesman described it as the most important document signed by the 
two PMs, since the Simla Agreement which contained reiteration of 
Kashmiris' right to self-determination.
    
He said "We believe that the Lahore Declaration is an important 
milestone on our path to promoting peace and security at the heart 
of which lies resolution of Jammu and Kashmir issue".
    
He pointed out that the MoU, signed after the summit together with 
the Lahore Declaration and Joint Statement, affirmed that 
resolution of all outstanding issues including Kashmir, was 
essential for establishing peace and security in the supreme 
national interest of the two sides.
    
The spokesman said that the next round of dialogue between the 
foreign secretaries of the two countries would be "an occasion for 
India to demonstrate that the symbolism of Vajpayee's visit had its 
true foundation in sincerity; that the real purpose of the visit 
was to change status quo in order to change the entire scenario 
which was steeped in tensions".
    
Responding to journalists' questions, the spokesman said that 
"indigenous peaceful Kashmiri struggle" sometimes led to violence 
and it was for the Indian PM to discover what impelled the 
Kashmiris to resort to violence.
    
The spokesman rejected the suggestion that Pakistan had given up 
its proposal for third party mediation in the event of failure of 
bilateral efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue. The FO spokesman 
stressed that non-settlement of the dispute posed threat to peace 
and security not only at regional but also at global level, making 
it incumbent on international community to help resolve the 
dispute.

Asked for elaboration of reported willingness of the Chinese 
defence minister in response to Pakistan's request for arms, the FO 
spokesman said that Pakistan was free to secure weapons in 
commensurate with its security needs from anywhere it deemed 
proper.

<a name="ties">Ties with Pakistan to grow, says Chi </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: President Rafiq Tarar said on Monday that the 
Sino-Pakistan ties have become a precedent of lasting friendship 
for the rest of the world.
    
Talking to Chinese Minister for Defence Chi Haotian at Aiwan-i-
Sadr, the president said the two countries have stood by each other 
in the times of trial. The Pakistan-China friendship, he said, is 
stronger than mountains and deeper than oceans.
    
The two countries, the president said, have a complete consensus on 
regional and international sensitive issues. Ties between Pakistan-
China, he said, are also vital for regional and world peace. The 
friendship with China is the cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign 
policy, he said.
    
President Tarar said China has always sided with Pakistan on the 
Kashmir issue, and he also referred to Chinese role after India 
went for nuclear tests in May last. "China understood the security 
needs of Pakistan," the president said.
    
The president assured the Chinese minister of Pakistan's support on 
Tibet and Taiwan. He hoped that the two countries would work for 
regional prosperity in all fields.
    
Reciprocating the president's sentiments, Chi Haotian said the two 
countries have stepped up their cooperation in various fields. He 
said Pakistan and China would continue to work for peace in Asia.
    
The Indian nuclear tests, he said, unbalanced the power structure 
in the region. Pakistan, Haotian said, was forced to go for nuclear 
tests to meet its security needs. The Chinese minister thanked the 
government and the people of Pakistan for warm hospitality.
    
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz and other officials were present at 
the meeting.-NNI
    
General  Chi  Haotian at the head of defence delegation held a 
meeting with Pakistani defence team headed by Secretary Defence Lt 
General (retd) Iftikhar Ali Khan in the Ministry of Defence here on 
Monday, adds our Islamabad Correspondent.
    
Welcoming the Chinese delegation, the Secretary Defence recalled 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's successful visit to China in 1998, 
during which various agreements were signed including the direct 
flights between Hong Kong and Pakistan besides other economic and 
technical cooperation.
    
He appreciated valuable assistance of China in the field  of 
defence, particularly in defence equipment production. He termed 
various existing facilities built with Chinese help as eternal 
monuments of this relationship. He hoped that this relationship 
would continue to grow stronger.
    
While expressing his gratitude, the visiting dignitary said he 
could see and feel the warmth of Pakistani people, government and 
the armed forces for China. Referring to his meeting with the 
president, the prime minister, the foreign minister and the 
services chiefs, he said the two sides exchanged views on various 
issues of importance.
    
CORPS HEADQUARTERS: Gen Chi and Lt Gen Wang Zhicheng, the 
counterpart of Pakistani Crops Commander and members of the 
entourage visited the Crops Headquarters here on Monday, adds PPI.
    
On arrival at the Crops Headquarters, the Chinese delegation was 
warmly received.
    
The delegation witnessed a demonstration of bayonet fighting, 
efficiency test of soldiers and firing drill by recoiless rifle 
crew. The Chinese defence minister appreciated the skill and 
professionalism of the soldiers.

<a name="army">Army asked to continue helping Sindh govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Feb 23: The government has directed the military 
authorities to continue helping the Sindh administration in 
investigating criminal cases, specially those related to terrorism 
and heinous crimes.
    
"You can not eliminate the role of army to come in aid of civil 
power and it will continue to help the provincial government to 
arrest terrorists and hardened criminals", said Interior Minister 
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain.
    
Talking to Dawn on Tuesday he said that although the operations of 
the military courts had been suspended in Sindh, as was directed by 
the Supreme Court, the role of the army could not be ignored to 
hunt the terrorists and other anti-social elements.
    
Responding to a question Mr Hussain said that the presence of the 
army in Karachi was necessary at least for some time to improve the 
law and order situation there.
    
"There is no two opinion that the military courts provided a great 
deterrence and people at large had heaved a sigh of relief in 
Karachi", he said.
    
To another question the interior minister said that the army would 
also help protect the lives and properties of the citizens who 
volunteered to record their evidences against terrorists and other 
hardened criminals.
    
"Anti-terrorist courts will hear the cases as has been directed by 
the Supreme Court in place of the military courts but you need 
assistance of the army to help the provincial government in the 
preparation of cases", Mr Hussain said.
    
Asked when the federal government would restore the provincial 
assembly and whether there was an early plan for lifting the 
Governor's rule from Sindh, he said no such proposal was under 
consideration. "Governor's rule cannot be lifted without achieving 
the desired results", he said adding that the law and order 
situation demanded that normal political activities should not 
resume in Sindh so quickly.
    
He said that the federal government had been facing a lot of 
pressure even from the PML provincial legislators to restore the 
assembly by lifting the Governor's rule. "But I do not think we can 
take the chance unless there is certain improvement in the law and 
order situation there".
    
To a question he said that the performance of Sindh Governor Lt-Gen 
Moinuddin Haider was satisfactory in checking violence and 
terrorism in the province. He said that the Sindh Governor enjoyed 
the full support of the federal government.
Talking about the incidents of violence and disruption during the 
arrival of the Indian prime minister in Lahore on Feb 20, he 
regretted that the Jamaat-e-Islami chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad did not 
know the psychology of the people. "Qazi sahib is different from 
all the previous chiefs of Jamaat and that is why his party is fast 
losing the public support", he said.
    
The Interior Minister said that five of the foreign ambassadors 
based in Islamabad complained to him on Monday that there cars were 
damaged by the protesters in Lahore during the 2-day stay of the 
Indian PM in Lahore. "Is it not a shame that you do not spare even 
the diplomatic community and by doing so what service you are 
rendering to the country", the minister said.

<a name="metr">Metropolitan police plan shelved</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, Feb 26: The plan for setting up a metropolitan police 
force for Karachi has been shelved, it is learnt.
    
According to informed sources, district management group of the 
civil bureaucracy has allegedly scuttled the government-community 
efforts directed towards this end. The plan was approved by the 
prime minister last year.
    
Sources said the bureaucracy's success in shooting down the plan 
was mainly attributable to the principal secretary to the prime 
minister who right from the very beginning had been expressing his 
reservations on this plan.
    
They said the bureaucracy had impressed upon the prime minister, 
who between August and November had made known his commitment on at 
least four occasions, including the one on which the Colombian 
experts presented their report, that he had in principle agreed 
with the setting up of a metropolitan force for Karachi, that the 
proposed system "is aimed at eroding the role of district 
magistrates."
    
"Today if a role is assigned to the deputy commissioner in the 
proposed metropolitan setup, there will be a metropolitan police 
setup in the city in the shortest possible time," said a senior 
official, who asked not to be named. "The present system provides a 
very convenient setup to politicize the police affairs," he added.
    
Under this arrangement, the official said, maintenance of law and 
order and prevention of crimes was the dual responsibility of the 
police and executive magistrates without really making any one of 
them responsible for any particular situation.
    
An ordinance in connection with the proposed police system was 
supposed to be promulgated by the governor latest by January, but 
there is no official word about it as yet.
    
The others government officials who opposed the plan were the 
additional interior secretary, the provincial chief secretary and 
the home secretary and they prepared an "alternative plan" in place 
of the one prepared by the Citizen-Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) 
which was presented to the prime minister.
    
The "alternative plan," according to the sources, wanted that 
improvement in the police department should be brought about 
through other measures which were needed to be implemented in 
phases and there was no need for a separate metropolitan police 
department for the city at present.
    
These officials had argued that under the Phase-I of the plan, the 
existing police for Karachi were to be strengthened through 
mobilization of resources, recruitment on vacant posts, 
availability and provision of more vehicles and arms, development 
of forensic services, training facilities and computer education.
    
Besides, they said, there was a need to impart education to the 
existing police aimed at bringing about a change in their attitude 
and behaviour in order to raise their level of efficiency and 
honesty.
    
The Phase-I should follow the beginning of a rule-making process 
and finalization of amendments in the existing laws before Karachi 
was separated from rest of the province as far as the police 
department was concerned, they further said.
    
They had also expressed concern at the absence of any role for 
commissioner and deputy commissioners in the proposed setup, saying 
"separation of judiciary from the executive has already affected 
the executive, resulting in the breakdown of administration."
    
The government officials had also questioned the effectiveness of 
the proposed system saying there would be no change in the 
performance of the police under new system as metropolitan police 
force would be raised from the existing force when the majority of 
the policemen were already inefficient and a considerably high 
number of them both inefficient and corrupt.
According to the Citizen-Police Liaison Committee, the government 
officials had transgressed the mandate they had been given by the 
prime minister.
    
The CPLC said the committee was asked by the prime minister to 
finalize a complete timeframe for the implementation programme. The 
timeframe should have covered all the steps such as promulgation of 
an ordinance for a new Police Act and its consequent approval by 
the cabinet; formation of Karachi Metropolitan Public Safety 
Commission; appointment of the chief of Karachi Metropolitan Police 
Department; necessary amendments in CrPC/Evidence Act/Traffic Law; 
and the time period needed for making the new police department 
operational.
    
As far as other issues such as questions with regard to the setting 
up of commission, metropolitan department; appointment of police 
chief were concerned, they had already been addressed with profound 
arguments in the report presented to the prime minister by the 
CPLC.

The sources said that despite various bottlenecks and shortcomings, 
specially on the revenue and export fronts, the review mission was 
likely to recommend to its headquarters for the release of $50 
million tranche in March. It was also expected that the mission 
would offer $100 million out of $1.6 billion ESAF/EFF before the 
end of the current financial year.
    
Both sides also discussed the formulation of the next budget, with 
Pakistani sides assuring that more funds would be allocated for 
development works and that there would be a cut in the non 
development expenditure in 1999-2000.

<a name="d8to">D-8 to play active role, hopes Sartaj</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

DHAKA, Feb 25: Pakistan's Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, who arrived 
here on Thursday for D-8 summit, said the new economic bloc would 
enter into a "more active phase" of economic cooperation among the 
member states.
    
Talking to newsmen on arrival at the Zia International Airport, he 
said the D-8 had identified a number of proposals in the last two 
months for cooperation in economic, trade and technical sectors.
    
The Dhaka summit would give a new momentum for the implementation 
of those projects, Sartaj said.
    
Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad received his Pakistani 
counterpart at the airport.
    
Mr Sartaj said the first phase of the bloc was more exploratory, a 
lot of work had been done identifying various projects and 
proposals of cooperation.
    
He said the whole idea behind the grouping was to promote 
cooperation in economy and concentrate on technical collaboration. 
"We can learn from each other and share our markets... I hope, the 
D-8 will enter into a more active phase now."
    
Asked how he sees the prospect of D-8 in the backdrop of slow 
progress of SAARC, Sartaj Aziz said SAARC had a political problem 
that obstructed its progress in view of the India-Pakistan 
relation, India-Sri Lanka problem and India-Nepal problem.
    
"D-8 has no political problem and the relation of D-8 member 
countries is smooth and harmonious," he said. He, however, hastened 
to add that he was hopeful about the SAARC since India and Pakistan 
were now trying to resolve their political differences.
    
Asked whether Vajpayee-Nawaz Sharif meeting in Lahore last week 
would accelerate the solution of Kashmir dispute, Mr Sartaj termed 
it as a good beginning and said: "For the first time, India has 
shown willingness to discuss Kashmir as the core issue."
    
He said: "Previously, India was not willing to talk about Kashmir. 
But now they want to discuss Kashmir seriously. They've also 
accepted that without discussing Kashmir, the relation cannot be 
normalised."
    
Replying to a question, the foreign minister said the foreign 
secretaries of India and Pakistan would now meet in the next four 
to six weeks and then the foreign ministers would meet to resolve 
the problem through dialogue.
    
He said the Lahore Declaration stated that intensified efforts 
would be made to resolve the problems, including Kashmir.
    
He did not rule out the possibility of Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif's visit to India, and said: "Dialogue is always useful when 
it takes place at the highest political level."
    
About Dhaka-Islamabad relation, he said: "It's very good and 
cordial" and added: "We need to expand our bilateral trade."

<a name="decl">Pakistan declines invitation to attend world moot</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Feb 24: Pakistan declined an invitation by the US to 
attend a global conference on fighting government corruption, 
inaugurated by Vice President Al Gore at the State Department on 
Wednesday and attended by almost 90 countries.
    
"I don't know why they did not come but we have clarified to all 
invited governments that an invitation did not in any way mean that 
these governments were either corrupt or doing nothing to check 
corruption," a State Department source told Dawn.
    
India and Nepal were the two South Asian countries participating in 
the conference in which, Al Gore said, some countries were so keen 
to participate that they said bilateral relations with the US could 
be affected if they were not invited.

Al Gore's inaugural speech at the conference was directed at 
government corruption round the world, but appeared to have been 
tailor-made for countries like Pakistan.
    
He quoted extensively from the Quran, the Old Testament, Confucius 
and Sa'adi to highlight how corruption at the top could eat into 
the vitals of a nation.
    
Gore narrated a story attributed to Sa'adi to illustrate the 
importance of leadership. 
    
The story was: "A King was moving with his army through the land 
when he came upon some beautiful apple trees. The King asked for an 
apple, ate it, and suddenly noticed his top general had gone to pay 
the owner the price of the apple.
    
"When the General returned, the King challenged him: "Why did you 
pay the man? He must have been flattered to have a King take a 
piece of his fruit."
    
"Your Majesty," his General explained. "If you had taken even one 
apple, your army would have taken the whole orchard".
    
He quoted Quran saying: "O my people! Give full measure and full 
weight in justice.... And do not evil in the earth, causing 
corruption."
    
He said official corruption can speed environmental destruction, 
accelerate the drug trade, even encourage the smuggling of 
biological, chemical or nuclear weapons materials.
    
The Vice President announced that over the next two years the US 
will work diligently with our friends and partners to:
    
- urge other key exporting nations to ratify and implement the OECD 
Convention on Bribery;
    
- to develop and implement global standards on transparency and 
accountability;
    
- to conclude an Agreement on Transparency in Government 
Procurement at the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle later this 
year; and
    
- to pursue region-wide anti-corruption initiatives in the 
Americas, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Europe 
    
- including urging ratification in the United States Senate of the 
Inter-American Convention and seeking full implementation by all 
signatories.
    
Gore said government corruption could not only destroy economies 
and destabilise governments but also hamper economic growth and 
employment in other countries.
    
He outlined a strategy for addressing corruption, including: fewer 
and clearer regulations, greater privatization of government 
activities, increasing accountability of government officials, and 
assuring the free flow of information.
    
"Economically, corruption represents an arbitrary, exorbitant tax," 
Gore said. "It can lead to wasteful government spending, bigger 
deficits, greater income inequality, and a crisis of confidence 
that can spark capital flight, crash the economy, destabilise 
governments, and put people half way around the world out of work."

<a name="alta">Altaf flays Nawaz for singling out Karachi</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Feb 22: Muttahida Qaumi Movement chief Altaf Hussain has 
criticised Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for singling out Karachi 

while referring to acts of terrorism in the country during his 
recent address to the nation.
    
He said the PM had deliberately ignored Punjab where more people 
had died in religious terrorism as compared to Karachi.
    
In an 18-page statement issued in London, Mr Hussain deplored that 
Mr Sharif had used Quranic references to justify the illegal, 
unconstitutional and un-Islamic killings either in police custody 
or through military courts.
    
He said Islamic injunctions clearly stated that the relatives of a 
person killed could either take revenge or accept blood-money or 
forgive them - an indirect reference that the relatives of those 
killed in police custody or through summary trials could demand the 
lives of the killers. "In Islam, everyone is equal before God, 
whether he is a ruler or an ordinary person, and Qisas and Diyat 
can be claimed from the ruler as well."
    
Mr Hussain claimed that five MQM workers had been killed extra-
judicially after the imposition of governor's rule in Sindh. Israr 
Ahmad, he said, was killed by government officials after his arrest 
whereas Fasih Ahmad Jugnu, Muhammad Anwar, Mubashir Ali and Arman 
were arrested and tortured to death.
    
"Thus the government is directly responsible for the killing of 
these five innocent people who were killed even before being 
produced before a court of law," he said. "Under the Islamic law, 
their relatives could claim Qisas and Diyat from the president and 
the prime minister."
    
The MQM chief said similarly, the relatives of around 300 workers 
killed during the tenure of Nawaz Sharif in police custody or by 
torture or fake police-encounters could also claim Diyat and Qisas 
from those who tortured and killed them or from those who ordered 
the killings. "In Islam it's eye for an eye, ear for an ear and 
nose for a nose and a tooth for a tooth," he said quoting a verse 
from the Holy Quran.
    
The MQM chief said by misquoting the Quranic verses, the prime 
minister tried to justify the killings of the Mohajirs which were 
being carried out by state agencies and through the government-paid 
touts. He said the prime minister tried to convey a message to the 
people that whatever he was doing was right and in accordance with 
the teachings of Islam.
    
The PM, he added, ignored other Quranic verses in which the God had 
directed the rulers to treat their subjects equally and with 
justice. He said Mr Sharif did not refer to those verses because 
that would have exposed him and his so-called love for Islam."
    
The MQM chief said successive rulers in Pakistan had misused the 
name of Islam for their own political objectives and Sharif was no 
different from his predecessors.
    
He said that Nawaz Sharif had long been dreaming of crushing the 
Mohajirs and recalled that in 1992 he had launched an army 
operation in Karachi to crush the MQM and its people. However, he 
said, he could not fulfil his ambitions at that time as his 
government was dismissed on charges of corruption and incompetence.
    
Hussain said that the army operation in 1992 was launched on the 
pretext of arresting 72 "big fishes" from Sindh. "The list of 72 
big fishes was also produced in the National Assembly. Can the 
prime minister tell the nation how many big fishes were arrested 
during that army operation?"
    
He said when the operation was launched Nawaz Sharif had claimed 
that it would be an evenhanded operation and it was not aimed 
against any particular community or group. "Every child in Pakistan 
now knows why the operation was launched and who was the target and 
that not a single big fish was arrested during that operation."
    
The MQM chief also held the PM responsible for the deterioration in 
the law and order situation in Karachi. He maintained that before 
the 1992 operation, there was complete peace and harmony. "If there 
is any one to blame for the present situation in Karachi, it is 
Nawaz Sharif himself, who ordered the killings of thousands of MQM 
people and created a private army to kill MQM workers," he said.
    
Referring to the mention of terrorism in Karachi by Nawaz Sharif, 
the MQM chief pointed out that the prime minister conveniently 
ignored the growing incidents of terrorism in the Punjab, which was 
being ruled by his younger brother, Shahbaz Sharif.
    
He said that the crime figures presented by Interior Minister 
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain in the National Assembly made it very 
clear that the largest number of people were killed in acts of 
terrorism in Punjab.

<a name="indi">Pakistan, India default on palm oil purchases</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 25: Pakistan and India have defaulted on some of 
their earlier purchases of palm oil from Malaysia for 
February/March shipments, traders said on Thursday.
    
"There is default of some earlier purchases by consuming countries. 
I think it is easily around 30,000 tons of February and March 
shipment," said a marketing manager at a palm oil refinery.
    
He said more defaults could be in store following the sharp fall in 
prices.
    
"Since the buyers have defaulted on the contracts, the sellers have 
no choice but to sell back to the market," said a trader.
    
Malaysian palm oil prices fell further by midday on Thursday as 
players sold off their positions for fear of more contract defaults 
by consumer countries, traders said.
    
A weaker Chicago soyaoil futures on Wednesday, dented by talk of 
cancelled vegetable oil sales from Argentina and Malaysia plus a 
drop in the Brazilian currency, dragged down palm oil prices.
    
"Soyaoil continues its fall on many bearish factors and palm also 
followed," said a trader who expects more declines in the near-term 
as the market anticipates more defaults by buyers.
   
Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) wheat futures fell sharply on 
Thursday as world grains markets reacted to reported defaults by 
Pakistan and India on palm oil contracts.

Australian grains and oilseeds traders on Thursday told Reuters 
they believed reports of the defaults, especially in view of the 
sharp fall by markets around the world. But they had no further 
first-hand details.
    
SFE wheat futures prices fell in trades by up to A$1.50 a ton. 
March 1999 sold down by 75 cents to A$158.00 while January 2000 
fell by A$1.50 to A$163.00.
    
Turnover was comparatively heavy on a total of 70 lots.
    
Reports of the Pakistan and Indian palm oil defaults drove grains 
markets down further, he said.-Reuters

<a name="mcai">MCA issues show cause notices to 16 cement cos </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Feb 26: Monopoly Control Authority (MCA) has issued 
notices to 16 cement manufacturing companies of the private sector 
to show cause by Feb 27 as to why penal actions may not be taken 
against them under sub-sections 1(a) and (2) of section 19 of MRTPO 
for "failure and continuous failure" to comply with the authority's 
Order of Feb 20, an official source said.
    
Under this order, the authority had held the cement industrialists 
guilty of forming a cartel by simultaneously raising the price by 
Rs100 and curtailing the production by a uniform 55 per cent. In 
this connection, the authority has fixed March 1 as the date for 
hearing in its office.
    
In case of non-appearance on the said date, the authority "shall 
proceed in the matter as provided under the law", that is impose 
the penalty for non-compliance.
    
In reply to a question, the source said the MCA's authority did not 
extend to the state-owned enterprises. It had, however, recommended 
to the government to direct the four units of the State Cement 
Corporation to implement the MCA order issued to the private sector 
firms requiring that the cement prices be restored to the pre-
October 1998 level.
   
MCA is also likely to suggest to the government that the rate of 
penalty for non-compliance with its orders be enhanced by an 
ordinance, the source added.
    
The penalties provided at present in the Monopolies & Restrictive 
Trade Practices Ordinance, 1970 (MRTPO), are 27-year old and have 
almost completely lost their sting due to erosion of value of the 
rupee, he explained.
    
The maximum penalty the authority can impose on a recalcitrant 
company is one lakh rupees in lump sum and Rs10,000 for each 
subsequent day of non-compliance. This is not even peanuts, given 
the fact that the cement manufacturers, for example, have made 
billions of rupees since they banded themselves into a cartel last 
October and raised the price by Rs100 per bag.
    
The government has given numerous concessions to the business in 
the light of the steep devaluation of Pakistan currency, while its 
effect on matters involving ordinary consumers' interests were 
completely ignored.
    
The MCA, according to the same source, was also considering to 
propose to the government that non-compliance with orders of the 

authority within 15 days should be declared a criminal offence 
punishable also with imprisonment.
    
He said this is in conformity with similar laws for checking rise 
of monopoly power and protection of the consumers which have been 
enacted in India, United States and other countries. In Pakistan, 
MCA's hands are bound because it has been kept on starvation diet 
ever since its inception, while the MRTPO is so weak as to 
incapacitate the authority to function meaningfully to safeguard 
the public interest.

<a name="cott">Cotton crop to reach 8.7 million bales: APC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Zafar Samdani

LAHORE, Feb 25: The Agriculture Price Commission (APC) has placed 
this year's cotton crop at 8.7 million bales, the same as has been 
done by the Cotton Crop Assessment Committee (CCAP) of Pakistan.
    
At its meeting in Multan on Thursday, the Commission looked into 
reports received from various sources and evaluated them to reach 
the 8.7 million bales figure.
    
CCAP, however, is yet to hold its final meeting to make the yield 
figure official. APC's conclusion has to be taken as unofficial 
though most experts agree that there is unlikely to be a major 
change in cotton's produce.
    
APC's meeting, presided over by its chairman, Iqbal Naved, was 
attended by government officials, agriculturists, experts from 
provinces and private sector representatives from related 
industries.
    
APC's break up of the final figure is 6.6 million bales in Punjab 
and 2.1 million bales from Sindh, which generally conforms to the 
assessment of CCAP.
    
In another cotton related development, Punjab Cotton Crop 
Management Group, headed by Chief Minister's Adviser Jehangir 
Tareen also deliberated on the crop's yield and tried to identify 
reasons why it had fallen behind the 10.5 million bales target it 
was expected to achieve.
    
According to experts attending the meeting, major factors 
responsible for the low crop were 'American' bollworm, pest attack 
and extremely unfavourable weather conditions, including 
hailstorms.
    
But the committee also considered the position of certified seed's 
availability and felt that it needed to be improved substantially.
    
Certified seed available to growers for the last crop was 20% to 
25% of requirements. For the next crop, 30% seed is expected to be 
certified which means that out of a total requirement of 49,000 
tons of seed only 17,000 tons would be available. Of this, 7,000 
tons seed would be produced by Punjab Seed Corporation while the 
rest would be provided by the private sector.
    
A number of companies are currently engaged in producing quality 
seed. Their concentration appears to be on cotton. But the best of 
their efforts would leave the crop short of about 32,000 tons of 
certified seed.
    
The Punjab Group is said to realize that seed constraint is not to 
be resolved overnight and that as long as there isn't a substantial 
improvement in the quantity of reliable seed, the crop would 

continue to remain unpredictable.

<a name="taxp">Tax-payers penalized, claim businessmen</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 25: Tax-payers having no taxable activity are also 
being penalized by the sales tax authorities on account of late 
filing of returns, business circles claim.
    
This fact came to fore when the Collector Appeals, South Zone, 
Karachi through an order No 719/98, dismissed 29 appeals filed 
against the order of Sales Tax department.
    
The government last year suddenly changed the last date of filing 
of monthly sales tax returns from June 20 to 15 and a large number 
of tax-payers, who could not file the returns by 15th July, 1998 
were heavily penalized for delay in filing by one or two days.
    
Business circles say at that time the city was paralysed by strike 
call given by a political group and above all the announcement was 
so sudden and restricted to print media that most of the tax-payers 
did not take note of it.
    
While demanding one-time exemption from penal action against late 
filing of sales tax monthly returns, business leaders say that if 
traders and tax-payers were not subjected to such unwanted penal 
actions, the same would have not served as adverse input for others 
who would have volunteered for registration.
    
Instead of promoting a tax culture, the concerned officers of the 
department under the cover of such harsh and penal provisions are 
trying to make the GST scheme a total failure, he added.
    
Under the circumstances business circles feel that it would be more 
appropriate and justified if such penal provisions are amended 
suitably to provide facility for at least one time exemption to the 
tax payers who due to bona fide reasons could not submit the 
monthly returns within time.

<a name="powe">Power rates may go up by 11.52pc from March</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 21: The average electricity charges in the city are 
likely to go up by 11.52 per cent from next month as the Karachi 
Electric Supply Corporation has sought such an increase in tariff 
as well as in generation cost to overcome its liquidity crunch.
    
The increase in average tariff and generation cost from the present 
level of Rs3.84 per KWH to the proposed level of Rs4.28 would 
affect the domestic consumers most, who are already suffering due 
to average and inflated billing.
    
The KESC has sent its case to the National Electric Power 
Regulatory Authority (NEPRA). Under the proposed scheme, the impact 
of increase on different types of consumers would be as follows: 
Domestic Overall 12.47 per cent, Commercial 11.30pc, Industrial 
11.30 pc, Bulk 11.30pc, Agriculture 11.30 pc, Public Lighting 
11.30pc and Special Contracts 1.55pc.

On March 9 last year the KESC had raised the average tariff by 
21pc, which in effect was much higher than the officially claimed 
impact.
    
According to NEPRA, the KESC plans to reduce the overall system 
losses to 29.03 per cent and has claimed that transmission losses 
are 25 per cent. In fact, transmission losses are about 35 per 
cent.
    
The KESC has claimed that based on the current average rate of 3.84 
rupees per KWH 7,729 million KWH sold with 25pc transmission and 
distribution losses, it expected to receive a revenue of Rs30.40 
billion during July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000. Expenditure for the 
same period and apportionment has been estimated at Rs33.79 billion 
which would result in a deficit of Rs3.39 billion.
    
While the KESC has asked for increase in tariff it has also 
proposed charging policy for 11 KV underground and overhead 
extension.
    
According to the present self-financing policy, the total cost of 
11 KV underground and overhead extension with accessories is being 
charged from the applicant irrespective of load and length. The 
first consumer getting connection in a newly-developed area is 
required to pay more cost depending upon the distance of his plot 
fro the existing 11 KV distribution facilities.
    
No contribution of 11 KV extension is being charged from the next 
applicant provided service connection through an already laid 
cable/overhead mains by the first applicant or from an existing 
subscription of PMT.
    
In order to formulate an equitable procedure for cost sharing high 
tension extension only among consumers the KESC has proposed that a 
sum of Rs3,500 per KW be charged from all industrial, commercial, 
multistoried and combined housing schemes as "System Development 
Charges (SDC)," which include the cost of material, laying charges 
and supervision.
The proposal also include cost sharing for the extension of 11 KV 
extension and adjustment. The proposal include charges for high 
tension, overhead conductor etc.
    
Meanwhile, the Association of Builders and Developers (ABAD) has 
expressed its reservations over the proposed revised charging 
policy for 11 KV under- ground and overhead extension under the 
self-financing policy for providing new connections to various 
types of consumers.
    
The chairman of ABAD claimed that the cost of distribution system 
for apartments was much less than individual houses, but the 
proposed KESC policy envisaging a levy of Rs10,500 per apartment in 
case of 3 KW load for a flat of 1,200 square feet. But for the same 
load provided to a house of 200 square yards, the consumer is 
required to pay Rs3,000.

<a name="econ">Economy shows 3.5pc growth in 8 months</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Feb 24: The economy, during the first eight months of 
the current financial year, has shown a growth of 3.5 per cent 
against the annual target of 6 per cent, according to official 
estimates.
   
The IMF itself has projected the growth rate for the whole of the 
current financial year at 3 per cent in view of the continuing 
stagnation in the economy.
    
The stagnation is said to have been caused mainly by the 
government's conscious policy to keep the imports depressed in 
order to eliminate completely the gap between import and export 
bills.
    
This policy was said to have been adopted in view of the imminent 
default facing the country and increasing shortage of foreign 
exchange which lasted till late January 1999 when the IMF finally 
agreed to resume the EASF/EFF programmes and also helped Pakistan 
to obtain rescheduling of $3.3 billion of official debt from the 
Paris Club.
    
The tight grip on imports is said to have created massive shortages 
of raw materials and industrial intermediaries affecting adversely 
the domestic production and investments.
    
The slow down in the economy, as a result, is said to have 
seriously affected the revenue collection, especially the incomes 
from customs duty, excise duty and sales tax.
    
Forced by dwindling revenue income the government reportedly put a 
tight cap on expenditures and stopped releases for a large part of 
the non-development budget. The development budget had already been 
curtailed to Rs85bn.
    
Successful capping of expenditure is said to have drastically 
reduced the need for bank borrowing for budgetary purposes bringing 
down the current bank borrowing amount to less than Rs5bn against 
the whole year target of Rs43bn.
    
The actual bank borrowing ostensibly for budgetary purposes upto 
mid-February is estimated to be around Rs56 billion, but Rs51 
billion of this amount is said to have been taken out of the 
monetary system and deposited with the State Bank of Pakistan as an 
insurance against the debt arrears that was being built up against 
Pakistan's non-preferred debt obligations.
    
At one point this stock of insurance against non-preferred debt 
arrears had gone up to about Rs72 billion bust since the Paris Club 
decision to allow Pakistan debt rescheduling to the tune of $3.3 
billion, this amount has come down to Rs51 billion and officials 
expect these arrears to disappear completely by end of June this 
year.
    
In view of this the officials feel confident of achieving the IMF-
imposed budgetary deficit target of 4.3 per cent of GDP by June 30, 
1999.

<a name="expo">Exports to Afghanistan allowed against rupee</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Feb 24: Export Development Committee here decided on 
Wednesday to allow exports to Afghanistan against Pakistani rupee 
without submission of E-form but against shipping bills.
    
Minister for finance Ishaq Dar presided over the meeting, which has 
decided that the exports to Afghanistan will be allowed freely 
against Pak rupees.
   
Primarily, the exports of pharmaceuticals, matches, fabrics, 
cement, soaps, detergents, rock salt, textiles and sugar have been 
allowed without the submission of E-form to help increase the local 
production.
    
The meeting, sources said, also did not object to the goods 
reaching Afghanistan being re-exported to Central Asian States or 
any other country.
    
"The purpose is to encourage the local production for which this 
decision has been taken with the prior permission of Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif", said a concerned official.
    
Since the exports to Afghanistan will not be treated as export 
sales these will not be entitled to duty drawback, exemption from 
excise duty, GST and export finance. Also sales to Afghanistan from 
bonds operating under various temporary importation schemes will 
not be treated as exports. Necessary notification will be issued by 
the State Bank/ministry of commerce shortly.
    
The committee expected that the permission to export goods to 
Afghanistan will increase demand for the unutilized capacity of 
those industries which were using primarily indigenous raw 
materials.
    
The other issues discussed were the difficulties in the operation 
of GST relating to refund and audit, imposition of 2 per cent 
withholding tax on services on exporters, excise duty on temporary 
importation by Sindh government, difficulties in temporary 
importation for re-export, chartered flights exports and clearance 
of temporarily imported goods by courier services and committees 
were set up to resolve these issues.
    
The question of clubbing of levies was also discussed and the 
committee was assured that this was under active consideration and 
report will be presented soon.
    
Issues of personal baggage, imports for re-export and personal 
baggage was also discussed and committees were formed to draw up 
the procedures.
    
Representatives of ministries of finance, commerce, health, CBR, 
Export Promotion Bureau, FPCCI, national chambers and different 
export associations were present.
    
The finance minister welcomed the participants and pointed out that 
representations have been received from the exporters that in the 
absence of proper banking facilities in Afghanistan, great 
difficulties were being faced by them to meet the requirements of 
foreign exchange against exports to that country, enforced by the 
government in Trade Policy 1998-99. Foreign exchange remittances 
were being arranged through third countries or open market making 
the exports expensive.
    
Informed sources said that the meeting was also told that  the 
State Bank will suspend the circular No 48, any time tonight or 
Thursday morning. Sources said that Ishaq Dar also promised to help 
amend the State Bank's circular No 44, relating to the export re-
financing. 
    
The new circular, to be shortly issued, the finance minister said, 
will provide indirect export re-financing to cover other areas.   
The finance minister agreed with chairman Pakistan Bedwear 
Exporters Association Shabir Ahmad that more fiscal and non-fiscal 
incentives should be offered to the exporters in the next financial 
year.

<a name="pena">Penalties on banks if dollar bonds not encashed on time</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Feb 22: Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday warned banks 
of penalties if they declined to encash the bearer dollar bonds on 
time.
    
Referring to various complaints received by his in this regard, he 
asked the State Bank top officials to hold a meeting with the heads 
of banks within a week.
    
He invited written complaints from public against banks not 
following the rules and regulations set for dollar bonds. The 
minister said that the government had even provided an incentive to 
the banks and offered the latter to retain the liquidity share with 
them at least for 12 months.
    
"As a penalty, the government would ask banks to surrender the sale 
proceeds on this account," he said.
    
He also made it clear that no withholding tax was liable to be paid 
on dollar bonds transactions.
    
He further directed the CBR and SBP to issue clarifications for 
general public in this regard.
   
The government is ready for an out of court settlement with Hub 
Power Company and KAPCO, said Finance Minister Ishaq Dar here on 
Monday.
"Government will welcome an out of court settlement of the case 
provided the power companies come forward with something tangible," 
he said. The finance minister said imprudent power policies 
followed during the 1993-1996 period caused the present 
controversy.
Under the policy of 1992, no turn-key project could be imported. 
The country had the ability to manufacture thermal power plants 
domestically, he added.
    
He said the government had ever tried to reach a negotiated 
settlement on the issue.
    
Moreover, he said, the government has already formed a committee on 
issue of IPPs. The committee comprises the people from private 
sector, he added.-APP

<a name="dari">Dar informs KCCI: 10pc margin on LCs withdrawn from today</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 23: Commerce and Finance Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar 
announced the withdrawal of 10 per cent margin on Letter of Credits 
(L/Cs) for imports from February 24.
    
In a meeting with the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry 
(KCCI), he said he would issue instructions to the State Bank of 
Pakistan (SBP) in the evening and the decision would be effective 
from Wednesday (February 24).
    
SBP had imposed a 30 per cent cash margin requirement on import in 
July 1998 and later slashed the margin to 20 per cent on January 9, 
1999. On January 24, the margin had come down to 10 per cent.
    
In response to KCCI's president suggestion for allowing holders of 
frozen foreign currency account to use their accounts as collateral 
with other banks, Ishaq Dar said that the matter would be referred 
to the SBP for positive consideration.
    
"I have done my job and now it is your turn as to what you can 
offer to kick-start the economy and improve revenue collection," 
Dar said.
    
He added that there is a shortfall of Rs8 billion in revenue 
collection during July-December 1998 compared to the target of 
Rs140 billion. "It is the only thing that irks the IMF while the 
donor agency is satisfied with other commitments."
    
He said it is time that business community should take some 
responsibility, pay taxes and increase revenue then I guarantee 
quick solution of your problems.
    
The commerce minister was hopeful of a positive outcome of the 
meeting on general sales tax between CBR and business community in 
Islamabad on Wednesday.
    
He said the business community apprehends that Income Tax 
Department may open old cases if they show higher turnover. The 
government, he added, may consider allowing additional surcharge on 
turnover tax as the full and final settlement of income tax.
    
Dar assured them of abolishing multiplicity of taxes like octroi, 
zilla tax and export tax in the next budget provided the 
businessmen give guarantee of additional revenue collection of Rs20 
billion.
    
He termed the higher mark-up rates as unjustified, unfair and un-
Islamic and asked the SBP to hold meetings with the banks so that 
the rates can be lowered.
    
On corruption in the Central Board of Revenue (CBR), Dar hinted at 
dismissal of at least 50-60 officials. "I have kept a close watch 
on these persons and soon they will be removed." he added.
    
The minister said that the ECO and SAARC alliances could be tapped 
to conduct barter trade with some regional countries through local 
currencies. "I have already approached some member countries that 
we should have bilateral agreement and I am waiting for a positive 
response from their governments," he added.
    
He also announced the inclusion of KCCI in the ITP Valuation 
Committee and asked the CBR to issue necessary notification in this 
regard on Wednesday.
    
Dar said a draft law on anti-dumping is ready and will be presented 
to the Standing Committee of the Cabinet in the next session in 
order to safeguard our industries. He said developed countries have 
been excessively applying anti-dumping laws, social standards and 
environment criterion against our exports.
    
Businessmen opposed the government's move to raise power rates by 
11 per cent. "I will ask WAPDA to review the situation," he said 
adding that IMF had been pressurising the government to increase 
the rate by 20-30 per cent.
    
Later, Dar inaugurated the KCCI web site.

<a name="ksee">KSE experiences another dull trading session</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 26: Stocks shrugged off the overnight easiness on 
Friday as investors were back in the rings and covered positions at 
the lower levels in most of the pivotals, telling bears that the 
current run-up was not overdone.
    
It was, however, another day of low volume as barring jobbers and 
short-term dealers, who played on both sides of the fence but 
institutional traders or foreign funds were not inclined to take 
profits.
    
Bulls are not inclined to loosen their grip on the market at least 
for the near-term and after consolidating positions they opt for 
new buying on the selected counters, analysts said.
    
"The second-tier blue chips and most of the low-priced mega issues 
are under squeeze and there are reasons to believe that the current 
bull-run is going to stay for a longer period than many predict", 
they added.
    
Good dividend pouring news in each session from the textile sector 
presented a pleasant surprise to even well-informed stock analysts 
as most of the payouts are well above their expectations.
    
The performance of the textile sector appears to be fairly 
encouraging as they managed to put on a good show despite a 
difficult time for the textile trade owing to recession in the 
south and Far Eastern markets ,dealers said.
    
The KSE 100-share index rose by 0.19 points at 926.21 as compared 
to 926.40 a day earlier, reflecting the strength of leading base 
shares including PTCL. Early it was about five points higher after 
recovering the initial losses.
   
"Thursday's correction was technical, which was overdue and has 
nothing to do with the basic market fundamentals", said an analyst 
and added, "low volume reflects a status quo and points to 
resumption of the run-up even by tomorrow".
    
But only extreme gains were clipped early on selected counters, 
while the broader market was not weighed down by profit-selling by 
jobbers and short-term dealers adding the market resumed its upturn 
as investors covered positions at the lower levels.
    
Prominent gainers were led by Gulf Bank, Metropolitan Ban, EFU 
General Insurance, Kohinoor Weaving, Shahtaj Textiles, Yusouf 
Weaving, PSO, Telecard, General Tyre, Glaxo and Ghanahdara, which 
posted gains ranging from Rs1.40 to 3.50.
    
Losers were led by Orix Leasing, Bank Of Punjab, Cherat Cement, 
Pakistan Refinery, Crescent Steel, Atlas Honda Car, Searle 
Pakistan, Quice Food and Lever Brothers, falling by Re1 to Rs25.00.
    
Trading volume fell to 50 million shares from the previous 67 
shares, while losers held a fair lead over the gainers at 60 to 55 
with 42 shares holding on to the last levels.
    
PTCL again topped the list of most actives, unchanged at Rs17.75 on 
10 million; shares followed by PSO up Rs1.50 at 66.70 on 10 million 
shares; Hub-Power up 20 paisa at Rs12.85 on 7 million shares; 
Telecard higher Rs1.45 on 6 million shares; and ICI Pakistan lower 
25 paisa at Rs8.15 on 5 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Fauji Fertiliser up 20 
pasia on 3.072 million shares; Engro Chemical up 45 paisa on 2.110 
million shares; KESC firm by five paisa after the news that it will 
issue bond worth Rs11.5 billion to pay off its loans on 1.311 
million shares; Bank of Punjab off Rs1.55 on 0.953 million shares.
    
Defaulting companies: Shares of five companies came in for stray 
support but finished unchanged barring Gammon Pakistan, which moved 
higher by 10 paisa on 2,000 shares. Salman Noman, Mian Textiles, 
National Motors and Suzuki Motorcycles accounted for 500,1,000, and 
500 each at the last levels.
    
Dividend: Knoll Pharma cash 100 per cent; Crescent Textiles 12.5 
per cent cash and five per cent bonus shares; Reliance Cotton cash 
12.5 per cent; Din Textiles cash 15 per cent; Faisal Spinning cash 
20 per cent; Blessed Textiles, cash 20 per cent; Shahtaj Textiles 
cash 25 per cent; Bhanero Textiles 20 per cent and Noon Sugar 15

Ardeshir Cowasjee

"THE first duty of a government is to maintain law and order so 
that the life, property, and religious beliefs of its citizens are 
wholly protected by the state." ( From Mohammad Ali Jinnah's Creed, 
enunciated by the founder himself on August 11, 1947, three days 
prior to the birth of his Pakistan).

This duty can only be fulfilled by an independent fearless 
judiciary. Sadly one must say, with deep regret and without fear of 
contradiction, that each government of Pakistan, in turn, has 
successfully done its best to hinder any chance of the judiciary 
gaining an even minimal independence. And this has been done at 
times with the active connivance, or the passive acquiescence of 
the judiciary itself.
    
The question today, fifty-one years down the road, is not how 
independent is the judiciary, but how demoralized and dependent it 
lies following the assault upon it engineered by this present 
government in November 1997.
    
The assault culminated in the storming of the Supreme Court 
building on November 28, while the court was in session, presided 
over by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah. The stormers who 
successfully obstructed the course of justice included 
parliamentarians, members of the ruling party and toughs of its 
street squads (euphemistically referred to as members of its 
various "youth" wings).
    
An enquiry was instituted by the succeeding Chief Justice Ajmal 
Mian on December 15 1997, a tribunal was thereafter constituted of 
which the last hearing was held on June 15 1998, over six months 
after the storming and of the commission of the gravest contempt in 
the face of the court.
    
During the course of the enquiry, exhibited in open court was a 
film recorded by the Court's closed circuit cameras, installed by 
an external independent agency on the orders of the previous Chief 
Justice, which clearly and in detail showed the storming. The sole 
tangible action taken by the Court during the hearings was to 
request the 'authorities' to dismantle the cameras as the 
honourable judges felt their security was at risk and threatened. 
Their announced intention was to install their own internal system 
of surveillance, which so far has not been done.  Sadly, to this 
day, the judges of the Supreme Court have done little to attempt to 
redeem their Court's honour by punishing those who belittled it.
'Life' in our country has been in constant and increasing jeopardy. 
When not taken by run-of-the mill dacoits, murderers, thieves etc., 
it is taken by terrorism, state or otherwise inspired, by religious 
and ethnic fanatics, by internecine turf wars, by the police in 
their staged 'encounters,' by the numerous government agencies in 
the course of their duties, by government activists and street-
fighters.
    
November 20 1998 : the draconian Ordinance XII was promulgated, 
allowing for the formation of a forum - Military Trial Courts 
(MTCs) - which was apparently unconstitutional and in conflict with 
the recent judgment of the Supreme Court (Mehram Ali case). The 
MTCs were empowered to impose even the irreversible penalty, the 
death penalty. This excess of the government was not checked by the 
judiciary. No order emanated from it suspending the execution of 
the penalty pending the examination of the vires of the Ordinance.
    
November 24 : Advocate of the Supreme Court Khan Muttaqui Nadeem 
filed in the Sindh High Court a constitutional petition (CP 1824/98 
along with CMA 5105/98) on behalf of Arif Khan and Qazi Khalid Ali, 
both Muslim adults, advocates by profession, against the Federation 
of Pakistan (Respondent No.1) and the Province of Sindh (Respondent 
No.2). The petition, inter alia, challenged the validity of the 
constitution of the MTCs and sought prohibition of the enforcement 
of the punitive provisions of the ordinance.
    
November 26 : the petition was heard by Chief Justice Kamal Mansur 
Alam and Justice Ghani Shaikh. Pre-admission notices were issued to 
the two respondents and a hearing fixed for December 4. Nadeem 
pleaded for interim relief, as he feared that men may be hanged, 
and thus irreversibly punished, while the court deliberated. He 
asked that executions be stayed. His pleadings were not considered, 
went unheeded.
    
December 4 : Nadeem again pressed for interim relief and a stay of 
the execution of irreversible penalties. A stay was not granted. 
The Court ordered : "It appears that service has been effected on 
both the respondents. Yet none is present for Respondent No.1. The 
Advocate General Sindh for Respondent No.2 requests for ten days 
time for filing comments. Time is granted. Adjourned to 16.12.1998 
.... The points involved in this case are important and it is a 
pity that despite of service on Respondent No.1 none is present on 
its behalf."
    
December 16 : No comments were filed by either respondent, no 
relief was granted, and the matter adjourned to December 24. On 
that date the Chief Justice constituted a full bench, comprising 
Justices Ghous Mohammed, Hamid Ali Mirza and Syed Saeed Ashad. The 
matter was fixed for hearing on December 30.
    
December 30 : Attorney General Chaudhry Mohammad Faruq appeared for 
Respondent No.1, Advocate General Mohammad Iqbal appeared for 
Respondent No.2. Interim relief was again sought but not granted. 
The order of the Court delivered by Justice Ghous Mohammad reads :
    
"Today this matter is fixed for hearing by a full bench comprising 
myself and my learned brothers Hamid Ali Mirza and Syed Saeed 
Ashad. Both of them are on winter holidays and at least one of them 
(Mr Justice Syed Saeed Ashad) has not been intimated about the 
constitution of this full bench. Therefore when this fact was 
brought to the notice of the learned counsel for the petitioners he 
submitted that in that case the matter may be listed for hearing on 
the 31st of this month. An application has also been submitted by 
the learned Attorney General wherein the prayer is that this matter 
be stayed till the petitions relating to the same subject matter 
which are fixed for hearing on 7.1.1999 before the honourable 
Supreme Court are disposed of. So far as this application is 
concerned copies have been supplied to the petitioners' learned 
counsel and this will be considered by the full bench. Since my 
learned brothers Hamid Ali Mirza and Syed Saeed Ashad, JJ, are on 
winter holidays and in the second week I will be on vacation 
therefore it is not possible for us to assemble for the hearing of 
this petition. Accordingly, office is directed to list this 
petition immediately after winter holidays according to roster."
   
December 31 : The next day, Ashraf Chakar Irani, alias Waheed, was 
hanged in Karachi Central Prison, the death penalty having been 
imposed by an MTC on December 17.
    
January 4 : Mohammad Rafi, alias Bubbly, was hanged in Karachi 
Central Prison, the death penalty having been imposed by an MTC on 
December 17.
    
January 8 (Friday) : The Supreme Court restrained the Government 
from executing any convict sentenced to death by the Military 
Courts until January 11 (Monday) when the MQM's application seeking 
interim stay of MTC's executions was to be taken up.
    
January 11 : The Supreme Court stayed the execution of those 
convicted by the MTCs until a decision is reached on the petitions 
challenging the formation of the MTCs.
    
February 17 : The Supreme Court declares that the setting up of 
MTCs for the trial of civilians is unconstitutional and without 
lawful authority. The cases of the two men who were hanged lie 
buried by the following sentence from para one of the Supreme Court 
Order : ". . . The above declaration will not affect the sentences 
and punishments already awarded and executed and the cases will be 
treated as past and closed transactions."  Present and correct when 
these "closed transactions" were transacted : Prime Minister Mian 
Nawaz Sharif plus his entire cabinet and his administration; Leader 
of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto and her acolytes; the honourable 
judges of the Supreme Court - Chief Justice Ajmal Mian, retires 
30/6/99; Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, J-1, retires 30/11/2002; Irshad 
Hassan Khan, J-2, retires 6/1/2002; Raja Afrasiab Khan, J-3, 
retires 17/9/2000; Mohammed Bashir Khan Jehangiri, J-4, retires 
31/1/2002; Nasir Aslam Zahid, J-5, retires 2/3/2000; Munawar Ahmad 
Mirza, J-6, retires 17/8/2007; Khalilur Rahman Khan, J-7, retires 
24/4/2001; Shaikh Ejaz Nisar, J-8, retires 14/6/2000; Mamoon Kazi, 
J-9, retires 29/12/2000; Abdur Rahman Khan, J-10, retires 5/6/2001; 
Shaikh Riaz Ahmad, J-11, retires 8/3/2003; Mohammad Arif, J-12, 
retires 9/1/2002; Munir A Shaikh, J-13, retires 1/7/2003; 
Wajihuddin Ahmad, J-14, retires 30/11/ 2003. (CJP Ajmal Mian will 
be succeeded by J-1 Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui who will in 2002 
be succeeded by J-6 Justice Munawar Ahmad Mirza, who will remain as 
CJ of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan until 17/8/2007.)
    
February 19 : The prime minister addressed the nation. According to 
this newspaper's Islamabad Bureau report : "Justifying his decision 
of setting up military courts, he argued that the government had 
taken the decision under the Article 245, assuming that it was in 
line with the Constitution and it could not be challenged in the 
superior court."
    
The assumption of the Government was obviously wrong.

<a name="anew">A new beginning</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

SINCE my article on Indo-Pak relations appeared last week, I have 
been inundated with email from readers, 90% of whom have broadly 
endorsed my suggestion to delink Kashmir and normalize other 
aspects of inter-state links.
    
The bulk of the letters have come from expatriate Indian and 
Pakistani readers of the Internet edition of this newspaper. Indian 
correspondents, in particular, have been struck by the fact that 
views such as mine are permitted to appear in print. Obviously, 
they are not familiar with the wide spectrum of opinions expressed 
daily in the Pakistani press just as we do not get the opportunity 
to read what appears in Indian newspapers. And this is precisely 
the point: once magazines, newspapers and books from each country 
are freely available in the other, and we can travel easily across 
the border without being hassled, we will see for ourselves what is 
obvious to outsiders: the similarities between the two neighbours 
are greater than the differences.
    
While the world media has made much of the violent demos launched 
by the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) in Lahore against the Indian PM's 
visit, foreign journalists mostly failed to point out the non-
representative nature of these protests. The Jamaat does not have a 
single seat in Parliament, and while it does have a certain amount 
of nuisance value, it stands isolated today from the mainstream of 
Pakistani politics. All major parties including the PPP, ANP and 
the MQM have supported Nawaz Sharif's peace initiative, and 
welcomed Mr Vajpayee.
    
This broad, bipartisan approach is a sign of maturity and should be 
applauded by all those who wish to see our politicians act more 
responsibly and for democracy to take root. This consensus is also 
an indication of a growing sense of realism: fewer Pakistanis than 
before have any illusions about the power equation in the 
subcontinent. While last year's nuclear tests may have given us a 
degree of deterrence, in conventional military terms, we lag far 
behind India. Our economy is in a shambles, and we have far less 
international support on Kashmir (or anything else) than we did a 
decade ago. Drugs, terrorism and our shortsighted support of the 
Taliban have eroded whatever goodwill we once enjoyed in the world 
community.
    
One Indian reader accused me of ignoring the plight of the Hindu 
population of Kashmir. Indeed, 20 Hindus were gunned down by 
militants during Vajpayee's visit; seven of them were part of a 
wedding party. This kind of mindless violence directed against 
civilian non-combatants hardly furthers the Kashmiri cause and 
needs to be condemned. The kidnapping and murder of four foreign 
tourists by an obscure Kashmiri terrorist faction two years ago 
revolted people around the world.
    
Another related issue is the treatment of our own minorities. While 
Muslim militants kill Hindus in Kashmir, we treat non-Muslims in 
Pakistan as second-class citizens. To all intents and purpose, they 
have been disenfranchised by Zia's obscurantist separate electorate 
laws. Christians have been jailed on trumped-up blasphemy charges 
that carry the mandatory death penalty; Hindu girls are routinely 
kidnapped and raped in Sindh; and Ahmadis have been arrested for 
uttering the traditional Muslim greeting, again under the draconian 
blasphemy laws.
    
In this climate of religious intolerance, to expect India and the 
rest of the world to hand over a million plus Hindus to the tender 
mercies of a bigoted Muslim majority is living in a fool's 
paradise. Over five decades of independent existence, we have 
witnessed a steady erosion of women's and minorities' rights; this 
retrograde trend has been paralleled by the virulent and explosive 
growth of fundamentalism in Pakistan.
    
Given all these factors, as well as the boredom and fatigue 
generated by the K-word around the world, it is patently clear that 
there is absolutely no prospect of getting India to hand over the 
part of Kashmir it controls. We have tried to obtain a decision in 
our favour (although not necessarily in favour of the Kashmiris) 
for fifty years, have fought two wars and spent an enormous amount 
in money and human suffering. Despite all these efforts, we have 
failed to achieve our purpose.
    
A wise man cuts his losses after realising that he cannot possibly 
succeed in a given task. Today, virtually every Pakistani will 
privately admit the futility of our policies; in public, though, 
politicians are locked into their own rhetoric and cannot easily 
break free without giving their opponents ammunition. But their 
slogans are sounding more and more hollow as they get overtaken by 
reality and events. The Jamaat knows it has no chance of ever 
getting into power and can therefore afford the luxury of adopting 
extreme, jingoistic postures to pressurise the government. 
Fortunately, Nawaz Sharif's grip on power is too secure for him to 
bother over-much about fringe protests.
    
The Lahore Declaration is a bold statement of intent. 
Unfortunately, its implementation has been left to the foreign 
ministries of the two countries. Given the bureaucratic mindset and 
the ossified attitudes that have developed over the years on both 
sides of the border, it is expecting too much of these hidebound 
organisations to display the imagination and vision required to 
achieve a breakthrough. If the two governments are serious about 
resolving their differences, the political leadership at the 
highest level has to be fully involved. Indeed, a Camp David type 
of extended conference should be seriously considered. We have had 
too many summit meetings with inadequate follow-up to have any 
confidence in the ability of the respective foreign ministers and 
secretaries to sort out problems that have piled up over five 
decades.
    
I know this is a cliche, but Pakistan (if not the whole 
subcontinent) stands at the crossroads: at the dawn of the new 
millennium, our economic and social indicators are abysmal. Rampant 
population growth combined with crippling debt servicing and 
defence expenditure have ensured we enter the next century as a 
virtual basket case. Intolerance and unemployment have spawned 
violent ethnic and sectarian gangs that threaten to tear the 
country apart. Peace with India may not be an instant panacea for 
all our many problems, but at least it would be a meaningful start.

We owe it to our children to make a fresh beginning. The process 
will be difficult and painful, but we have no viable option but to 
embark upon this road and support Nawaz Sharif in his efforts.

<a name="beat">Pakistan beat India by 46 runs in Asian Test opener</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

CALCUTTA, Feb 20:  Pakistan defeated India by 46 runs in the Asian 
Test Championship opener in front of  the 100,000-capacity empty 
stands at the Eden Gardens on Saturday.
    
The reputation of the Calcutta crowd was badly hurt when they 
hurled projectiles, fruit, water bottles on the Pakistan team after 
they had reduced the home side to 231 for nine in 32 minutes of 
play on the final morning. Attempt to put an enclosure on fire was 
averted as India, resuming at 214 for six before 50,000 odd 
spectators, were dismissed for 232 while chasing 279 for an 
outright win.
    
The umpires and the Pakistan team took the field thrice. But all 
the time they had to run for shelter as the unruly crowd refused to 
allow them to complete the play.
    
With no solution left after match referee's suggestion to award the 
game to Pakistan was rejected by the touring management, law 
enforcing people were contacted who virtually kicked the crowd out 
of the giant complex. Such was the brutality of the security 
officials that they even showed no mercy to the women, aged 
enthusiasts and small children by booting them and sometimes even 
using the baton.
    
It took more than two hours to vacate the stands. But when the 
stadium got empty, it gave a depressing look in the background that 
more than 400,000 spectators had turned up till the final morning 
to watch an exciting tussle.
    
When the match resumed after three hours and 20 minutes of 
interruption, Pakistan took only 10 balls to remove the final 
Indian pair to carve out a heart-throbbing victory. But it was such 
a pity that there were no spectators to watch the Pakistanis. There 
was no lap of honour by Pakistan. No one was there to clap when 
Saeed Anwar and Javagal Srinath came to pick their Men-of-the-Match 
awards.
    
The administrators and local media people, obviously looking upset, 
tried to pacify that there was a certain section of people who 
didn't want the match to be completed. They argued that it was 
because of the bookies who had put huge money on India's win. They 
claimed that if the match had been abandoned, the book-makers would 
not have been required to pay the money to the winners as there was 
no result. "That's why the World Cup semi-final between India and 
Sri Lanka was disrupted and the bookies got away with it," they 
said.
    
They were also of the view that the crowd was shown the way out 
because the local authorities had refused to be dictated by the 
bookies. "The entire crowd had to pay for it because the culprits 
couldn't be identified. If we had abandoned this match, then there 
would have been no stopping them. There had to be a time when the 
trend had to be halted," a Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) 
spokesman told reporters.
    
But whatever may be the actual reason, the crowd of Calcutta have 
lost their respect, reputation and above all the credibility. Once 
the best sporting nation today turns out to be worse. It would take 
them a very long time to restore their bettered pride. However, it 
has to be seen for how long Calcutta would be denied international 
matches as there was a unanimous view that it should be banned for 
at least three years.
    
Reverting to the proceedings of the match, Pakistan required just 
11 balls to dismiss the danger Saurav Ganguly who was caught by 
Azhar Mahmood off Wasim Akram. Akram then produced too good a 
delivery for Javagal Srinath who ended up getting an edge and Moin 
Khan bringing off a blinder in front of the first slip.
    
*From the other end, Shoaib Akhtar accounted for Anil Kumble who was 
caught magnificently by Shahid Afridi at covers. It was perhaps the 
best catch seen after a long time as the fielder had dived in front 
of him off a full bladed shot.
    
When the match resumed 200 minutes later, Shoaib Akhtar sent 
Venkatesh Prasad's middle-stump on a walk with his trade-mark 
express delivery. And the rest was history.
    
Shoaib Akhtar finished as the pick of Pakistan bowlers with four 
for 47 for match figures of eight for 111. Wasim Akram bagged two 
wickets for 64 to take his tally of Test scalps to 368 and six 
short of over-hauling Ian Botham's 373 to become world's fifth 
leading wicket-taker. Saqlain Mushtaq was not required to turn his 
arm over and had to settle with three for 69 and series haul of 24 
wickets.
    
For Wasim Akram, it was a special occasion as it was the first time 
that a Pakistan team had won two Tests on Indian soil. That also 
improved his captaincy record to 10 wins against four defeats since 
November 1995.
    
In this Test, Pakistan thoroughly exhibited their fighting skills 
when they lifted themselves from 26 for six on the first day to 
185, thanks to a inspiring knock of 70 by Moin Khan. They later 
dismissed the Indians for 223 after the home team were 147 for two 
with Shoaib Akhtar dismissing Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar on 
successive deliveries. Saeed Anwar's magical 188 paved the way for 
Pakistan to collect 316 and set India a target of 279 which looked 
well within reach after the openers raced to 108 for no loss.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

LAHORE, Feb 25: Helped by brilliant unbeaten knocks by Imran Nazir  
and captain Hasan Raza and excellent bowling by pacemen Yasir 
Arafat and Irfan Fazil, Pakistan under-19 team registered a 
convincing 8-wicket win over the South Africa under-19 team in the 
second international match here at to win the 3-match series the 
Gaddafi Stadium on Thursday.
     
Pakistan had won the first one-dayer against tourists by 61 runs at 
Gujranwala. The third and last match of the series will be play in 
Karachi on Feb 27.
    
Captain Hasan Raza won the toss and put in the visiting side to bat 
first on a sporting wickets. Spearheaded by Yasir  Arafat, the 
pacemen did not allow the South African side to bat smoothly and 
dismissed them for 197. 
     
Off-spinner Shoaib Malik rattled the stumps of last man Shaun Adams 
with a sharply-turning off-break to end the visitors' innings with 
four balls to spare in the stipulated 50 overs.
    
The roles were reversed by Yasir Arafat and Irfan Fazil. The former 
had destroyed the middle-order batting in the first international 
at Gujranwala on Tuesday while the latter had removed the late-
order batsmen. However, Yasir made early dents in the South Africa 
juniors' innings here claiming four for 28, while Irfan Fazil 
removed middle-order batsmen.
     
Irfan Fazil yorked Johan Myburgh (58 on 86 balls with four fours) 
to destroy all hopes of the visitors for a big total when he looked 
well-settled. Myburgh missed the line of the ball and got his  
middle-stump uprooted. Myburgh was involved in two productive 
partnerships. He added 46 runs for the sixth wicket stand with  
Captain Thami Tsolekile (25 on 41 balls with three fours). 
Tsolekile was caught by Shoaib Malik at point while mistiming a 
leg-break  from the left-arm spinner Qaisar Abbas at the total of 
136.
     
Myburgh and Con de Lange (22 on 38 balls) added 40 runs for the 
seventh-wicket partnership off 66 balls but Irfan fazil also broke 
the stand by clean-bowling the latter at the total of 186.
    
Earlier, Justin Ontong (24 off 38 balls) and Ahmad Amla (23 from 37 
deliveries) had added 47 runs for the second wicket stand in an 
effort to steady the visitors' innings. Qaisar Abbas had fine catch 
of Ontong at the square-leg on a mistimed flick off a delivery from 
Yasir Arafat to break the partnership which started the downfall of 
the visiting side.
    
Opener Imran Nazir played a domineering knock of 95 not out off 111 
balls in 154 minutes with the help of a big six and 14 fours to 
make the target of 198 look easy. After Kashif Siddique (12) and 
Kamran Ali (6) fell to the left-arm paceman Shaun Adams, Captain 
Hasan Raza joined the opener and both added 137 runs off 163 balls 
for the unbroken third-wicket partnership to take Pakistan under-19 
side to the target without any difficulty. Hasan also hit a huge 
six and sent the ball to the ropes six times in his enterprising 
unbeaten knock of 64 from 90 balls.
    
Both the not out batsmen stroked the ball to all parts of the 
ground to carve out a creditable win. Pakistan juniors achieved the 
target in 39.5 overs, losing only two wickets.
