KARACHI, March 5: Army's help will be sought in the investigation 
of the cases which will be referred to the proposed anti-terrorist 
courts.
    
This was decided at a meeting here on Friday. The meeting was 
presided over by Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, who has been named by 
the apex court as one of the coordinators to oversee the working of 
the ATCs, in addition to Justice Munawar Ahmed Mirza. Others who 
attended the meeting included the Chief Justice of the High Court 
of Sindh, Justice Kamal Mansur Alam, the chief secretary of Sindh, 
the home secretary, the inspector-general of police, Sindh, and 
Member Inspection Team of the High Court of Sindh.
    
The meeting also decided to deploy the Rangers for providing 
security to the anti-terrorist court judges, accused and witnesses 
in the 10 anti-terrorist courts, five each to be established at the 
KMC Rest House on Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan Road and the Municipal 
Training Research Institute, Clifton.
    
The meeting also noted that the anti-terrorist courts will start 
functioning as soon as the federal law ministry issued a 
notification regarding the appointment of the judges.
    
According to the decisions taken at the meeting, the army can be 
called in for the investigation of the cases, as provided in 
Article 245 of the Constitution. The involvement of the army in 
investigations has been recommended in the Supreme Court's short 
order of Feb 17.
    
While reviewing the existing three AT courts in Karachi, Hyderabad 
and Sukkur, the meeting recalled that these courts had announced 45 
death sentences commencing from September 1997 to February 1999. 
Seventeen cases were decided in Karachi, 18 in Hyderabad and 10 in 
Sukkur, despite all the difficulties the courts had to encounter 
because of the non-cooperation of the police.
    
Nine cases were not challaned before the AT courts by the police 
despite directions by the judges of these courts and in 84 cases 
the accused were absconding and no progress was shown by the police 
in their arrest.
    
It was pointed out at the meeting that in 34 cases, documents were 
supplied to the accused, which is a mandatory requirement under the 
Criminal Procedure Code.
    
The courts, which are administered by the federal government under 
the federal law, have no photo copiers and no budget for 
publication of notices in newspapers and prosecutors have not been 
provided in most cases.
    
The inspector-general of police assured the meeting of assistance 
to overcome all obstacles.
    
Two benches of the High Court of Sindh have been created for 
hearing appeals, and one of them will specifically hear appeals 
against the AT court judgments.
    
It was pointed out to Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid that on March 2 the 
high court received the proposed names of the judges and on the 
next day they were approved and sent to the ministry of law in 
Islamabad for issuing notifications and allocation of budget. As 
soon as that is done, the courts would start functioning.
    
In addition to the three existing AT courts in the province, all 
the new courts would be headed by district and sessions judges and 
additional district and sessions judges, who have been nominated 
for their competence, honesty and integrity.
    
All the new incumbents have been screened by the Military 
Intelligence, the Inter-Services Intelligence and the Intelligence 
Bureau.
    
The names of the new incumbents, who are already holding the charge 
of district and additional district judges, have not been revealed 
officially, but Dawn learnt through reliable sources that the new 
judges would be Rehmat Jafri, Abdul Hameed Abro, Sultan K. 
Siddiqui, Noman Shaikh, Salman Ansari, Jawed Alam, Abdul Ghaffar, 
Riaz Phulpoto and Arshad Noor Khan.
    
Presiding officers of the three existing AT courts are Hakim Ali 
Abbasi for Karachi division, Liaquat Hussain Shaikh for Sukkur and 
Larkana divisions and Salim Ahmed for Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas 
divisions.
    
The prosecutors who were working in the military trial courts would 
continue to serve in the same position and handle the same cases 
they were appearing for. They are Shahabuddin Memon, Haq Nawaz 
Baluch, Mehmood Bhatti and Abdul Qadir Rajput. Six more prosecutors 
would be nominated so that there is one prosecutor for each case 
and each court.
    
There would be an equal number of prosecuting deputy 
superintendents of police (PDSP).
    
The courts would start functioning from next week.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

action committees at district level to gear up workers for 
launching a movement against the government.
    
At a party meeting, which was attended by presidents and secretary

<a name="buss">Bus service: India may set up visa office in Lahore</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, Feb 28: The Indian government is considering a proposal to 
set up a visa office in Lahore for issuance of visas to the people 
desiring to travel to Delhi by bus.
    
According to official sources, the proposal was made by the 
Pakistani foreign office to the Indian government after the two 
countries signed a protocol in New Delhi on Feb 14 which provided 
for issuance of visas by road.
    
The protocol was signed when a Pakistani technical mission 
travelled from Lahore to Delhi by a PTDC bus to sort out details 
for the Lahore-Delhi bus service.
    
Sources say that the proposed Lahore visa office of India will 
consider in the first phase applications for travel by road. But 
the facility may be extended to visas by train and air which are 
presently being issued by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.
    
When the formal road link between the two countries will be 
established is yet to be decided by the government of Pakistan. But 
the PTDC, the government's authorized tour operators, is said to 
have made all arrangements to operate the bus service.
    
To begin with, an inaugural bus will run between Lahore and Delhi 
carrying some ministers, other elected representatives and 
journalists. According to sources, Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, 
Information Minister Mushahid Husain and Minister for Tourism 
Sheikh Rashid Ahmad may be included among the passengers of the 
inaugural bus service.
    
However, sources believe even this service may not be possible 
before mid-March. As for regular buses plying between the two 
cities, it will take another one week before all requirements, 
particularly issuance of visa by road, are met.
    
A senior PTDC officer says the bus service will begin as and when 
the government gives a green signal. An agency news item, also 
carried by Dawn, that the bus service is beginning from Monday 
(March 1) was contradicted by him.
    
According to the officer, the PTDC has purchased two luxury buses 
for the service. One of them has been made available to the 
corporation and another will reach in next 10 days or so.
    
As for the bus terminal at Faletti's Hotel in Lahore, all 
arrangements like a waiting lounge and cafeteria, have already been 
completed, according to sources.

<a name="paki">Pakistan to be poppy-free by year 2000: US official</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 3: The delay in the prosecution of major drug 
offenders has become a "great source of frustration" for the US 
efforts against drug trafficking in the region, US Counsellor for 
Narcotics Affairs, James R. McHugh, said here on Wednesday.
    
The cases of two prominent drug offenders, Sakhi Dost Jan Notezai 
and Munawar Hussain Manj, a former MNA, have been pending for the 
past several years, Mr McHugh said expressing disquiet over the 
delay in the trials of drug offenders.
    
"Corruption is widespread in Pakistan, and low salaries paid by 
government to enforcement and judicial personnel create a 
substantial risk which threatens the integrity of law enforcement 
and judicial institutions," said a summary which Mr McHugh 
circulated among the press corps.
    
He said that 22 extradition requests of the US government were 
already pending before the government of Pakistan. The government 
of Pakistan, he said, had passed a law in 1997 to set up special 
courts for trial of drug-related cases but lack of resources 
prevented creation of any special court in 1998.
    
However it noted that atmosphere for cooperation on drug control 
between Pakistan and the US improved significantly. Pakistan, he 
said, extradited two narcotics fugitives to the US, an improvement 
over 1997 when none was extradited.
    
Nonetheless US President Bill Clinton on the recommendation of 
Secretary of State Albright certified on Feb 26, 1999, that 
Pakistan had been fully cooperating with the United States or 
taking adequate steps to combat the illicit drug problem.
    
The 22 countries which had won certification by the US President 
are Aruba, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, China, Colombia, 
Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Hong Kong, India, Jamaica, 
Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela 
and Vietnam.
    
Mr McHugh appreciated the efforts made by the Pakistan government 
over the last ten years to eliminate poppy cultivation. "Pakistan 
has done remarkable job," he said adding that poppy production, 
according to the US estimates, was reduced by 26 per cent last 
year. Pakistan would become a poppy-free country by the end of year 
2000, he said.
    
As regards the data collection mechanism, he said, they had a 
satellite-based data gathering system, which, he claimed, was very 
accurate.
    
Mr McHugh said most of heroin being produced in this region was 
smuggled either to Europe or to Britain. Almost 80 per cent of 
heroin being consumed in Europe was going through this region, 
whereas a very small quantity was smuggled to the US. He said 
around 20 per cent of what was being consumed in the US, was going 
from this region.
    
He said for the US cocaine was a major problem than heroin as 
heroin addicts were estimated at only 250,000. In Pakistan, he 
added, there were around two million heroin addicts.
    
Commenting on report of the Taliban destroying heroin labs, he 
said, no independent verification was available. However, they were 
trying to verify these reports, he said.
    
Mr McHugh pointed out that the Taliban authorities did not arrest 
any owners of these laboratories located in Nangarhar province. 
Only few poor workers were arrested and punished, he said.
    
"According to the USG figures, Pakistan produced an estimated 65 
metric tons of opium in 1998," said a summary on Pakistan.
    
"While Pakistan has been reducing its opium production, Afghanistan 
has become the world's largest producer. As a result, Pakistan 
faces major challenges caused by the flow of opiates from 
Afghanistan and by Pakistan's rising heroin addiction problem. In 
addition, Pakistan is an important transit country for the 
precursor chemical acetic anhydride (AA), en route to Afghanistan's 
heroin laboratories. Pakistan's only AA factory was closed down in 
1998," it said.

<a name="scto">SC to take up plea against LHC verdict this month</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 3: A bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice 
Ajmal Mian, will take up the petitions for leave to appeal filed by 
the federal government against the Lahore High Court verdict in 
which it had declared that the decision to freeze the foreign 
currency accounts was void. The petition will be taken up in the 
third week of this month, Dawn learnt on Wednesday.
    
The court would also take up the petitions filed directly in the 
Supreme Court under its original jurisdiction. The petitions would 
be taken up by a bench of three judges.
    
A three-member bench of the LHC in its decision on Jan 27, 1999, 
had declared section 2 of the Foreign Exchange (Temporary 
Restriction) Act, 1998 freezing foreign currency accounts as void, 
and had ordered their immediate restoration.
    
The Lahore High Court decision was given on 121 petitions. The 
decision was stayed by Justice Irshad Hasan Khan of the Supreme 
Court the next day. Justice Irshad had referred the case to Chief 

Justice Ajmal Mian with recommendation that the matter should be 
placed before a seven-member bench.
    
The petition filed in the Supreme Court by the Foreign Currency 
Account Holders residing in European countries of Pakistani and 
non-Pakistani origin, would also be taken up by the bench.
    
The petition was filed from the platform of Association of Foreign 
Currency Account Holders, which claimed to have over 7,000 members 
residing in the UK, Norway, Germany, Denmark and the US.
    
The petition filed through Pakistani-US constitutional jurist, 
Barrister Dr Farooq Hasan had hinted to the apex court that if 
their grievances were not redressed they would be free to approach 
the international forums like International Court of Justice for 
the recovery of their "frozen funds."

<a name="paci">PAC introduces superior model of Mushshak aircraft</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, March 2: The Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC), Kamra, 
has upgraded the Mushshak aircraft by incorporating several 
modifications in its existing version.

Sale of the upgraded version, named "Super Mushshak," is being 
negotiated with potential buyers like Saudi Arabia, defence sources 
told APP here on Tuesday.
    
The PAC has retrofitted the 260 HP Lycoming engine and McCauley 3-
blade speed propeller, upgrading the performance of Mushshak.
    
The production of Mushshak aircraft reflects the high level of 
skill of PAC engineers. Besides Pakistan, this aircraft is being 
used by Sweden, Denmark, Oman, Syria and Iran.
    
According to the sources, modalities for the sale of additional 
four Mushshak to Oman have been finalized by both the countries and 
a final contract is likely to be signed soon.
    
Co-production of Grifo-7 airborne radar is also expected to be 
completed by May 2000. The infrastructure, including production 
equipment, has been completed at the PAC, according to the sources.
    
The programme is scheduled to have four phases: experiment, 
procurement of production equipment, training of manpower and 
regular production. The first three phases have been completed.
    
According to the sources, the recovery of 50 grounded Mirage 
aircraft and their avionic upgradation are the two main projects 
which are nearing completion and most of the requirements have been 
met through indigenous sources.
    
All the PAC factories have achieved ISO-9000 certification. As a 
result, they have gained confidence of their customers and have 
achieved international reputation.
    
The PAC Kamra launched a deletion programme to promote 
indigenization. As a result 511 metallic pipes out of 585 are being 
fabricated locally by the MRF thus saving a substantial amount of 
foreign exchange.
    
As many as 243 structural parts are also being manufactured locally 
by the factory. Investment casting facility and meteorological 
centre have been established in the F6 RF which are used for 
manufacture of high consumption small parts and supersonic drop 
tanks and for calibration of equipment and testers.
    
The facilities will also provide services to civil sector on 
commercial basis. Co-production of the MPDRs, CRC, RWR and 
overhauling of power generators is also another achievement made 
indigenously by the PAC through a delegation programme.
    
The Heavy Industries Taxila (HIT) established in 1979 to 
manufacture, modernize and rebuild tanks and APCs of the Pakistan 
Army is also on the forefront to meet the defence needs.
    
The years 1997 and 1998 have remained extremely eventful and 
rewarding for the HIT from the production, technical developments 
and administrative improvements point of view. During this period 
while achieving optimum production targets, historic contract was 
concluded with USA for manufacture of APCs and, above all, 
development phase of MBT-2000 Al-Khalid was completed successfully.

PRODUCTION OF TANKS AND APCs: During the period between February 
1997 and December 1998 the HIT manufactured, rebuilt and upgraded a 
large number of tanks and APCs.

MANUFACTURE OF PACs: The HIT was allocated $126 million by the 
Pakistan Army to manufacture APCs M113P. In line with the 
government's policy to obtain maximum cost benefits and keep 
dealings transparent, the HIT administration embarked upon an 
extensive market research and devised a new strategy for material 
acquisition and production management.
    
Its efforts duly supported by the government paid rich dividends 
and a contract was concluded to manufacture 1200 APCs. Production 
cost of the HIT is far below the international prices and has 
allowed huge savings to Pakistan.-APP

The maximum punishment, under the Contempt of Court of Act 1976, is 
six month simple imprisonment and fine upto Rs 5,000 or both.
    
The president had issued ordinance called Contempt of Court 
Ordinance, 1998 in which the amount of fine was enhanced upto one 
hundred thousand rupees. The ordinance promulgated on October 27, 
1998 stood repealed on February 26, 1999 when it completed its life 
of four months.
    
The court read out the charge to all the seven persons in the court 
and provided them one week time to give their responses whether 
they plead guilty or not guilty. The case will again be taken up on 
March 8.
    
The charge framed by the court reads as: "You were part of the 
crowd/people who had gathered in and around the Supreme Court of 
Pakistan building, Islamabad in the morning of 28.11.1997 and were 
involved in acts of rowdyism including raising of slogans and 
display of banners against the judiciary with the intention of 
bringing the authority of this court into disrespect or disrepute 
and /or to lower its authority and/or to disturb the order or 
decorum of the Court, and by your actions you have committed 
contempt of this Court, and rendered yourself liable to punishment 
under Article 204 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan and read with section 3 and 4 of the Contempt of Court Act 
1976."
    
The court which passed the order in the morning, made little 
alteration in it when it assembled at 11.30am. A court official 
pointed out to the court that Sardar Nasim who was issued show 
cause notice was neither cleared from charges nor was indicted.
    
The court clarified that the name of Sardar Nasim, was omitted from 
the list of indicted persons due to typographical mistake. The 
court charge sheeted Sardar Nasim at 11:30am.
    
The court accepted the apologies of Mushtaq Tahir Kheili, political 
secretary of prime minister, Tariq Saleem Lone, the then IGP,

<a name="peac">Peace moot calls for no-war pact</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 28: The Pakistan Peace Conference called upon India 
and Pakistan to abolish all nuclear weapons and missiles, sign CTBT 
and no-war pact, and in the context of Kashmir called for 
withdrawal of troops as well as end to foreign sponsored militancy 
in the region.
    
In a declaration adopted on Sunday at the end of the two-day 
conference, organized by Pakistan Peace Coalition the PPC expressed 
concern over human rights violations and threat to human survival, 
and advocated global denuclearization and disarmament.
    
It called upon both India and Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive 
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), not to deploy nuclear weapons and refrain 
from ballistic missile development.
    
It also urged the two countries to halt development of fissile 
material forthwith and channelise the existing fissile stocks for 
peaceful civilian use.

The conference called upon the two governments to take other 
confidence-building measures to ease tension and gradually 
eliminate the risk of war in the region.
    
The declaration resolved that "nuclear weapons offer no solution to 
fundamental political problems of a state, they exacerbate them."
    
The conference therefore, rejected these weapons and their 
"attendant nuclear nationalism", which is based on hatred and fear, 
and reinforced existing systems of patriarchy, class exploitation, 
ethnic and religious differences.
    
The conference welcomed the recent initiatives towards peace by the 
prime ministers of India and Pakistan and called upon them to go 
beyond symbolism and goodwill generated by the Lahore Declaration 
and take concrete steps towards peace and de-escalation of tension 
in the region.
    
The conference also called upon India and Pakistan to end 
confrontation on Siachin and urged to implement forthwith the 
agreement they reached 10 years ago.
    
The experts group on regional conflicts, which dealt with the issue 
of Kashmir called for the demilitarization of the territory and 
emphasized that Kashmiris should have a say in determining their 
future and Pakistan and India should not impose their will on them.
    
"Their views are primary and what India, Pakistan and others were 
saying is secondary," said I.A. Rahman, Director Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan while briefing newsmen at the conclusion of 
the two-day conference.
    
Participants of this group were of the view that Pakistan should 
stop supporting the militants and India should pull out its troops 
from the occupied territory.
    
The conference also deliberated upon the recent increase in the 
Indian defence budget and held that nuclear arms race was the 
greatest threat to peace and human survival in the region. It 
called for exerting pressure on both the countries to slash their 
defence expenditures, realizing that increasing defence budget 
would make life impossible for the people of the region.
    
The conference was of the view that Kashmir should not be allowed 
to hold back Pakistan-India cooperation in all possible fields, 
especially trade and culture.
    
This cooperation, it said, was only possible if the people of both 
the countries were allowed to emerge from the paranoia that had 
marked the Pakistan-India relationship. In this context it 
emphasised free movement of people between the two countries and 
sharing of media and culture, including an exchange of newspapers 
and periodicals.
    
The conference also called for wider public participation in 
setting national priorities.
    
In this context the conference established a commission on 
alternative security policy to examine implications of 
nuclearization and suggest confidence-building, arms control and 
disarmament steps necessary to protect the people of Pakistan and 
the subcontinent against the danger of nuclear war.
    
The commission would also determine the parameters of legitimate 
security arrangements for Pakistan, prepare an alternative defence 
policy and affordable defence budget.
    
The commission, which comprise of Air Marshal Zafar Chaudhry 
(convener), Dr Mubashir Hasan, Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy, Shahid Kardar 
and Brig A.R. Siddiqui and M.B. Naqvi, was required to submit its 
first report by May 28, 1999.
    
The conference also discussed Afghanistan situation. In this 
context some participants said Taliban were not the sole 
representative of the Afghan people and that any government there 
should include all shades of people. The participants also 
suggested demilitarization of that country and called upon 
suppliers of weapons not to do so.
    
In the global context the conference called upon the nuclear 
weapons states, particularly the US, to abolish nuclear weapons and 
missiles and demanded withdrawal of military forces from the 
region.
    
The PPC also set up a South Asia People's Commission on Minorities 
because it felt that the treatment of minorities in the states 
contributed to confrontation and conflict, both within their 
societies and between states.
    
Eminent human rights activists Asma Jehangir was nominated its 
convener who had been asked to report to the PPC not later than 
June 1999.
    
The conference also adopted a resolution which called upon the 
government to investigate the impact of nuclear explosion on the 
people and surroundings of Chaghi.
    
It also called upon the Senate to set up a standing committee for 
undertaking independent study to determine the impact of the blast 
on the local people.
    
The conference also denounced the rise of intolerant, 
fundamentalist ideologies and violence, whether sectarian or 
communal. This, coupled with the trend of settling disputes and 
differences with guns, had negatively impacted vulnerable groups, 
particularly women, who became the targets of a male-dominated 
culture that seeks to restrict their freedom, the conference 
resolved.

<a name="bill">Bill on pattern of 15th amendment under study, says Wattoo</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, March 2: Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs 
Mohammad Yasin Wattoo on Monday informed the House that a bill on 
the pattern of the 15th Amendment Bill was under study of the 
government and requested opposition Senator Dr Abdul Hayee Baloch 
to withdraw his bill which he moved on the private members day.
    
He took the floor after Dr Abdul Hayee Baloch introduced the bill. 
Dr Hayee's bill said that in order to secure adequate 
representation in the service of Pakistan for the persons belonging 
to various areas/class, it has become necessary to amend the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The bill, the 
mover said, sought to achieve the objective of adequate 
representation in the services of Pakistan. When the minister 
proposed that the mover should withdraw the bill, Dr Hayee Baloch 
did not press for the matter and agreed that it should be deferred 
in view of the federal minister's explanation.
    
The minister said that the government's bill had come back from the 
standing committee after its consideration there and it was now at 
the advanced stage.
    
Syed Iqbal Haider's bill called the Drug Amendment Bill was moved 
in his absence by Senator Raza Rabbani in Senate.
    
Health Minister Javed Hashmi, however, informed the House that the 
Government had already moved the bill on the subject in the 
National Assembly. The bill demanded severe penalties for spurious 
and fake drug manufacturers and traders.
   
Mr Hashmi said that the bill was now before the standing committee 
of the House. He assured the House that the government was willing 
to accommodate the opposition's point of view in the bill.
    
The House unanimously adopted a resolution moved by the opposition 
after a slight amendment from the treasury that "the word further 
be added to the resolution. The amended resolution read:
   
"This House expresses its concern over the incidents of killing and 
terrorism in the country in the name of religion and considers it a 
conspiracy against Islam and Pakistan and also expresses its 
solidarity with the innocent and fasting Muslims who were shot dead 
in a mosque and calls upon the Government to take further concrete 
steps to improve the law and order situation in the country." 
   
Earlier, the opposition was opposed to the amendment but 
subsequently after talks between the two sides, the government side 
moved the amendment which was adopted by the House unanimously.

<a name="ipps">IPPs issue to be settled within weeks, says Gohar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 4: Minister for water and power Gohar Ayub 
Thursday said the IPPs issue would be settled in few  weeks.
    
He admitted that the row could harm foreign investment in Pakistan 
but hinted that a final agreement was expected to reach between the 
IPPs and the government in the  coming few weeks. 'Things 
are moving in right direction,' Gohar said while responding to a 
question by Dr Safdar Ali Abbasi in Senate during the question 
hour.
    
The minister said the government was improving its agreement with 
the IPPs which include reduction in the tariff structure.
    
When asked by Senator Abbasi whether the government intends to 
withdraw termination notices (NIT) it had served against different 
IPPs because of failure to find any evidence of corruption against 
them, he said: 'I have no apparatus to get the investigation done 
into these corruption charges and so could not find concrete 
evidence."
    
He said in  case the IPPs were involved in international 
arbitration it would create difficulties for the government as the 
international courts required substantial evidence in such cases. 
And if the allegation could not be proved it could lead to huge 
damages. 
   
'Pakistan is not in a position to bear such damages,' the minister 
said, adding that the withdrawal of NIT notices, however, did not 
mean that the government could not move against the IPPs on 
corruption cases.
    
'The government has the right to proceed against them whenever it 
gets the evidence', Gohar said.
    
In his written reply, the minister for water and power told the 
Senate that 14 IPPs are currently under different stages of 
construction whereas 6 others are generating power and supplying it 
to their respective grid stations.
    
The 14 IPPs: Altern Energy; Davis Energen (Pvt); Eashatech (Pvt); 
Fauji Kabirwala Power Co; Habibullah Coastal Power (Pvt); Japan 
Power Generation (Pvt); Liberty Power Project; Northern Electric 
Co; Power Generation Systems; Tousch (Pakistan) Power; Saba Power 
Co; Sabah Shipyard Pakistan; Southern Electric Power Co; and Uch 
Power.
    
The 6 IPPs already generating power are: AES Lalpir; AES Pak Gen. 
(Pvt) Co; Gul Ahmed Energy; Kohinoor Energy and Hub Power Project.

<a name="suff">Pakistan suffers Rs40bn loss due to crop failure</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Feb 28: Pakistan has suffered a staggering Rs 40.84 
billion loss during 1998-99 in three crops, due to the long dry 
spell.

Official sources, however, admit that this loss could also be 
attributed to the slackness of the federal and provincial 
agricultural authorities.
    
"Nature (drought) has caused lesser damage to cotton, sugar-cane 
and wheat crops but an intolerable and unendurable loss has been 
caused by the traditional criminal negligence of the government 
agencies," an official said on condition of anonymity.
    
The government's much trumpeted target of 11 million bales of 
cotton yield in 1998-99, was cut down to 10.5 million bales only, 
to be further reduced to 10 million, then to 9.5 million before 
finally slipping down to 8.7 million bales.
    
He said cotton crop production dropped by 2.3 million bales, 
accruing a loss of Rs 27.60 billion rupees, at the rate of Rs 1,200 
per raw cotton bale. "This happened only because of the usage of 
inferior quality and uncertified seed."
    
The views obtained from experts revealed that the growers had used 
70 per cent uncertified or low quality cotton seeds. That badly 
undermined the targeted yield of raw cotton.
    
"It is the traditional laxity, heedlessness and delinquency on the 
part of the ministry of food & agriculture, scientists and 
provincial administrations, which failed to evolve cotton variety 
of better yield and also failed to provide 100 per cent certified 
cotton seed to growers," the official said.
    
Experts said the effects of low-quality cotton seeds came to 
limelight only under the dry spell, as during the past few years 
the torrential rains, hill torrents and floods appeared to have 
destroyed the cotton crop diverting expert's attention from the 
frightful role uncertified seed can play.
    
"... Nature (drought) has finally exposed that the flunkey seed can 
cause much more devastation than rains and floods to this major 
cash crop," the official said.
    
The experts are apprehending a one million tons shortfall in the 
projected (and required) production of wheat during 1998-99 due to 
the dry spell and depletion in the area under cultivation by 10 per 
cent.
    
This is being attributed to the government's inaction regarding the 
required increase in the support price of wheat. The government had 
estimated 19 million tones of wheat yield this year, for which it 
gave Rs 40 billion credit to farmers.
    
However, drought and non-increase in the support price of wheat 
discouraged its sowing by farmers and can lead to lesser output of 
wheat, by one million tones. This factor could force the government 
to import more wheat in 1998-99 for meeting the local consumption 
requirement.
    
In terms of value, a one million tons shortfall in wheat amounts to 
Rs six billion, if calculated at the rate of Rs 6,000 per ton (at 
the rate of Rs6/kg).-NNI

<a name="stat">State Bank reduces repo rate by 1 %</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, March 3: The State Bank on Wednesday cut its interest rate 
on short term lending for up to three days by 1 per cent to 15.50 
per cent - sending a signal to all banks to follow the lead.
    
SBP issued two separate circulars to announce the decision that 
would take effect from March 4 1999. In June 1998 the SBP had 
reduced its short term lending rate from 18 to 16.5 per cent.
    
"The impact of one per cent cut in SBP lending rates would not be 
significant," said treasurer of a local bank. "The cut only serves 
as a signal to the banks that they should also reduce their own 
lending rates," he said.
    
Senior bankers say their cost of fund would hardly come down after 
the cut in SBP lending rates - and as such banks would not be able 
to slash their own rates - particularly in the absence of a real 
demand for bank borrowing.
    
SBP lends short term funds up to three days against Treasury Bills 
and Federal Investment Bonds to help the banks overcome their 
temporary liquidity problems. The maximum yield on Treasury Bills 
currently hovers around 13 per cent. Federal Investment Bonds of 3-
year and 5-year maturity carry an interest rate of 13 and 14 per 
cent and that of 10-year offer maximum yield of 15 per cent.
    
"It would be too much to expect banks to buy T-bills at 13 per cent 
and use them for raising short term finance from State Bank at 15 
per cent," said treasurer of a foreign bank. "Besides the SBP short 
term lending is meant only for those banks that fail to square up 
their position on a certain day and want to cover it by borrowing." 
He said the SBP short term lending against government securities 
was not a regular mode of raising funds for the banks.
    
Senior bankers said inter-bank lending rates for up to three days 
remained pegged at 1 per cent on Wednesday adding that the market 
was wallowing in surplus liquidity estimated around Rs15 billion. 
They said one-year funds were available at 12 per cent.
    
Sources close to ministry of finance told Dawn that weighted 
average lending rates of banks fell from 16.09 per cent in June to 
15.62 per cent in December 1998 - showing a fall of only 0.47 per 
cent within six months. They said the 1.5 per cent cut in short 
term lending rate in June 1998 was partly attributable for this 
fall. Top bankers argue that keeping this in mind it would be too 
much to expect a significant fall in banks lending rates after 1 
per cent cut.
    
Finance Minister Ishaq Dar has been on record saying that the 
government was aware of the high cost of borrowing.
   
He has also said time and again measures would be taken to enable 
the banks to cut their lending rates. Top bankers say the cut in 
SBP rate is one such measure from the government viewpoint adding 
that the other measure already taken was setting up of Small and 
Medium Enterprises Authority (SMEDA) to create additional demand 
for bank borrowing.
    
The objective is to pull out the economy from a slowdown the signs 
of which are very obvious - the most prominent being an absence of 
project financing by the banks for last one and a half year.
    
The government is also considering a proposal on providing tax 
rebate to banks as an incentive if they reduce their lending rates.

<a name="crun">Crunch hits provincial allocations, ADP cut</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaukat Ali

LAHORE, March 4: The federal government has informed all provinces 
that it will not be able to honour its financial commitments made 
in June last year in view of the low collection of revenues for the 
year current financial year.
    
Well-placed sources told Dawn here on Thursday that following this 
intimation, the provinces had substantially axed their development 
and non-wage operations.
    
"Punjab has cut down its Annual Development Programme (ADP) by over 
Rs two billion as supply of funds according to the budgetary 
provisions for the current fiscal year is not forthcoming from the 
federal government," senior Punjab government officials told this 
reporter, confirming the reports of funds undersupply from 
Islamabad.
    
Sources in to the ministry of finance said that Sindh and the NWFP 
would also reduce their development plans by anything from 11 to 16 
per cent for the current financial year.
    
"Instructions have been issued to all the provincial government 
departments to immediately reduce expenditure on petrol, telephone, 
stationery, travelling and purchase of durable goods. No bill in 
this connection will be reimbursed to any department from now on 
unless a prior permission for such an expenditure is obtained by 
them from the finance department," the official sources here said.

Though the officials remained tight-lipped in unveiling the exact 
amount of the cut which the federal government is applying on 
transfers (from the divisible pool of taxes) to the largest 
province, insiders said it would be more than Rs 5.45 billion.
    
The province, they said, was nowhere near getting Rs 68.48 billion 
from the divisible pool of federally collected taxes which was 
projected for the Punjab by Islamabad in the annual budget for 
1998-99.
    
Reduction in import duty and a less than estimated GDP growth rate 
has forced the government to refix the revenue collection target, 
first at Rs 334 billion, then at Rs 324 billion and it now rests at 
Rs 318 billion.Hence reduction in funds to the federating units 
would commensurate with the federal government's income.
    
"Not only has a downward revision in the funds made the task of the 
provincial government difficult for financial adjustment in the 
remaining part of the year, it has also put financial managers in 
the Punjab in a quandary about planning next fiscal year's 
allocation to various departments and projects," the sources quoted 
senior government officials as saying.
    
The official sources said that so far the Punjab had not asked for 
an overdraft from the State Bank of Pakistan bank to manage its 
recurring expenditure under the new situation. "But the way things 
are shaping up you cannot rule out the Punjab demanding an 
overdraft from the central bank," they added.

<a name="taxc">Tax credit for banks to keep mark-up at 14 %</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Jamal

LAHORE, March 1: The government is considering a proposal of giving 
what Board of Investment (BoI) Chairman Humanyun Akhtar termed 'tax 
credit' as a fiscal incentive to banks which keep the interest rate 
as low as 14 %.
    
Akhtar revealed the proposal on Monday in his meeting with All 
Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA-Punjab) leaders. Punjab 
APTMA Chairman Abid Farooq chaired the meeting.

He did not divulge the details of the proposal, but added: 'It (the 
tax credit incentive) will be pretty useful for banks making 
money.'
    
'The government doesn't intend to put pressure on the banks to 
reduce their interest rates or offer credit to unviable projects. 
We are just trying to give fiscal incentives to them to encourage 
them to recommence advancing credit, something they are not doing 
at present,' Akhtar explained.
    
When proposed that the textile industry be allowed credit at a 
concessional interest rate to maintain buffer stock of cotton, he 
said it was simply impossible because IMF would not like the idea 
of subsidizing financing by the banks. He said IMF already wanted 
that the subsidized credit be done away with. He said the central 
bank was also not in favour of offering subsidy on credit because 
of the prevalent economic conditions.
    
His remarks dashed the APTMA hope of securing export refinance for 
cotton yarn below 30 counts. Nevertheless he encouraged APTMA to 
'mount pressure on the government (to seek facilities) for the 
revival of the industry'.
    
'You know whenever an industrial association puts its pressure on 
the government it gets things done. Be more assertive,' Akhtar told 
the APTMA committee. However, he said everyone was at a loss as to 
how to reduce interest rates despite a strong wish for it.
    
He said liberal fiscal incentives were in place to attract the 
foreign investors. He conceded that inflow of foreign investments 
had dipped after July, but claimed the 'graph had started to rise 
after the recent deal with IMF'.
    
He said the BoI intended to undertake a vigorous campaign for 
promoting Pakistan and bringing foreign investors to the country. 
He also intends to undertake several visits to the Middle Eastern 
as well as western capitals for this purpose. He did not agree to a 
suggestion that the poor law and order situation and illiteracy was 
impeding the flow of foreign investment.
    
He said the law and order situation had improved in the recent 
months and 'we still have educated, skilled unemployed workers to 
be absorbed by new industries'.
    
Earlier, Punjab APTMA Chairman Abid Farooq apprised him of the 
several problems facing the textile sector and put forward number 
of proposals for its revival.
    
He said the textile industry employed about 40 % of the industrial 
workforce and generated over 60 % of the export earnings.
    
The export performance of the textile industry had declined in the 
first seven months of the current fiscal year after remaining 
stagnant for three years. He said it was imperative to revive the 
industry if the economy was to grow and expand.

<a name="firs">First Women Bank may not be privatized</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaukat Ali

LAHORE, March 1: The Privatization Commission has decided not to 
privatize the First Women Bank after seeing the bank's performance 
during the last two calendar years, Dawn was told by official 
sources on Monday.
    
The FWB had faced a critical time during 1996 when it suffered 
financial losses and was offered for sale. 'The bank's fate was to 
be determined by its performance '97 which was not very encouraging 
although it was not as bad as in the preceding year. The bank 
improved its financial outlook during '98 which it ended with a net 
profit of over Rs35m and averted the danger of selling it out to 
private sector', the sources close to the PC said.
    
The other major factor which made the government not to privatize 
the bank, the sources said, was the high rate of repayment of its 
loans. 'It is perhaps a record in the financial sector that 
returning of the loans advanced by the FWB is 98%', the sources 
added quoting last year's figures.
    
The bank has so far disbursed loans amounting to around Rs 2.93bn 
among about 1,100 women. The loan range is from Rs 25,000 to Rs 

50,000. In exceptional cases the loan ceiling is enhanced.
In the meantime, the Bank which has been allowed by the federal 
government to set up a Business Centre at its main Gulberg branch 
here, has started providing E-mail service to women for the 
promotion of their business. The centre will also disseminate 
information among women about the export potential of different 
articles relating to women and help them promote their businesses 
for the local markets.
    
'Funds will be made available to women who want to expand their 
entrepreneurship or who receive export orders for items produced by 
them', the sources said.
    
The centre is linked with the local offices of the Export Promotion 
Bureau and the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry for 
obtaining and passing on business opportunities coming from the 
local as well as foreign markets to businesswomen.

<a name="kesc">KESC suffers loss of Rs2.96bn in 1998</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dilawar Hussain

KARACHI, March 3: Directors should brace themselves to face furious 
shareholders at the KESC's annual general meeting (AGM) on March 
31. Promises were made at the previous AGM that 1998 would be a 
better year, but things stand far worse from what they were a year 
ago.
    
The financial figures released by the KESC on Tuesday, show that 
the corporation made a mind-boggling loss of Rs2.960 billion for 
the first six months (July-December 1998), which works out to a 
loss of nearly Rs500 million a month.
    
The figures for all of the previous year to end-June 1998 have also 
been simultaneously released, which puts the loss for the year to 
Rs6.857 billion and the accumulated losses to end-December 1998 at 
spine-chilling Rs14.797 billion.
    
The last cash dividend had been paid by the KESC to the 
shareholders, eight years ago at 10 per cent in 1989, but bonus 
issues were a regular feature until 1995 when one-for-ten shares 
were issued. 
    
Although capitalisation of profit did dilute the shareholders' 
equity and earnings, a payout in any form was, nonetheless, better 
than none.
    
The year 1996 and 1997 went blank and a dividend for shareholders 
for 1998, was again out of the question and the board has 
recommended none.
    
The 10-rupee share in KESC has shed 64 per cent of its value in 
about a year from Rs23.80 on December 31, 1997 to Rs8.65, 
currently.
    
Which ever way one may look, the utility appears in a financial 
mess. There are countless problems. But Transmission & Distribution 
Losses (T&D losses) top them all. At a huge 35 per cent, T&D losses 
have been eating into more than $200 million or Rs10 billion of the 
Corporation's potential revenue.
    
The report of the statutory auditors on the accounts have almost 
always been qualified and the most grievous of the qualifications 
pertain to the T&D losses and the exorbitant payments to employees 
on account of overtime. 

The T&D losses which touched all-time record at 34.53 per cent for 
1997 had again taken off after only temporarily receding to 31.20 
per cent for 1996 from 31.37 per cent in 1995. T&D losses have 
mounted from 18.84 per cent ten years ago in 1988 and 23.80 per 
cent seven years ago in 1991.
    
Even the company auditors had gone as far as to comment: "One of 
the factors for this increase (in T&D losses), is the rising trend 
of theft of electricity, which has directly affected the 
profitability of the corporation; the amount of theft however, 
could not be determined and billed as it is subject to 
identification." 
    
As regards the overtime, auditors stated in their 1997 report: "The 
overtime paid to employees amounted to Rs807.9 (1996:Rs 728.6) 
million, representing an increase of Rs79.3 million or 10.9 per 
cent over the last year (1996); the overtime paid is also 
substantial as compared to basic pay of employees which aggregated 
to Rs546.1 million for the current year (1997)."
    
Utility analysts estimate that the T&D losses for the year 1998 may 
have risen further to touch 40 per cent. Lately, the government is 
reported to have approved a financial restructuring plan for the 
KESC. 
    
The Rs30 billion package, approved by the Economic Coordination 
Committee (ECC) in November last contain several measures including 
the permission to KESC to issue Rs11.5 billion in bonds to be 
guaranteed by the government. The proceeds from the bonds are 
envisaged to clear KESC's dues to PSO and SSGC.
    
A power sector analyst said that the KESC had been asked to reduce 
its T&D losses to 22 per cent by 2001 under the commitment to the 
World Bank.
And he concluded: "All the financial restructuring will be futile 
unless the operating leakages, the root cause of KESC's 
deterioration, are plugged".
    
Government holds high hopes of being able to sell  the utility. But 
with such  financial and operational muddle and by the KESC 
management's own admission that the new owners would be obliged to  
make a capital expenditure of at least $350 million in order to 
make the corporation viable, will a genuine buyer come forward

<a name="equi">Equities keep run-up position on hefty buying in MNCs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 5: Stocks on Friday maintained their upward drive as 
investors continued to build-up long positions on the blue chip 
counters buoyed apparently by some positive developments on the 
corporate front. The KSE 100-share index rose by another 14 points 
at 984.39 point or 1.40 per cent.
    
The sustained run-up, however, owes its strength largely to heavy 
buying in most of the leading MNCs, notably some leading chemical 
shares under the lead of Engro Chemical, Fauji Fertiliser, Dawood 
Hercules and prominent energy shares including Shell Pakistan PSO, 
and some of the IPP issues notably Japan Power and Hub-Power.
    
"The management of the Hub-Power may deny the news about settlement 
of the tariff issue and withdrawal of corruption charges against 
it, it is now not a distant possibility when the details are 
announced," said a leading analyst.
    
It was perhaps the perception of a settlement of the IPP issue, 
which has lured foreign investors back in the rings and they are 
making an extensive buying in all the low-priced energy shares set 
up by the Independent Power Producers (IPPs).
    
Analysts said the weekend rally is always considered a good omen 
for the market as instead of taking profits, investors make fresh 
buying apparently for some good reasons or on inside information.
    
The KSE 100-share index is heading to attain its base level of 
1,000 points possibly by the middle of the next week and that could 
well prove a turning point for the future share business outlook, 
they added.
    
It was last quoted at 984.39 as compared to 970.77 a day earlier, 
showing a fresh recovery of 13.62 points or about 2 percent.
    
"The presence of foreign fund buying on a massive scale though on 
selected counters has boosted the morale of the general investor 
who is now not inclined to miss the rising market", they said.
    
Plus signs were again covered the entire list, with some of the 
blue chips finishing with sharp gains under the lead of Shell 
Pakistan, Dawood Hercules and Nestle Milkpak, which posted gains 
ranging from Rs7.40 to 10.00.
    
Other good gainers were led by EFU General Insurance, Askari 
Insurance, Adamjee Insurance, EFU General Insurance, Askari 
Insurance, Reckitt and Colman, Cherat Paper, Rafhan Miaze and Lever 
Brothers, rising by Rs1.50 to 3.65. FFC-Jordan was also actively 
traded in response to news that its DAP plant has resumed 

production and truck loads of the commodity are being sent to the 
distribution network. It rose by Rs1.05 at Rs12.05 on over 4 
million shares.
    
Losses on the other hand were mostly fractional and reflected lack 
of support rather than large selling. IGI Insurance, BOC Pakistan, 
Ghani Glass and Mitchell's Fruits were, however, an exception, 
which suffered fall ranging from Rs2.00 to 8.00. 

Trading volume was maintained on the higher side thanks of fresh 
massive buying in Hub-Power on market talk of settlement of the IPP 
issue, falling to 114 million shares from the previous 161 million 
shares but gainers maintained a strong lead over the losers at 76 
to 45, with 29 shares holding on to the last levels.
    
The most active list was again topped by Hub-Power,lower 10 paisa 
on late weekend selling at Rs15.70 on 47 million shares followed by 
PTCL, easy five paisa at Rs18.45 on 20 million shares; Fauji 
Fertiliser up Rs2.35 at Rs48.45 on 11 million shares; PSO up 80 
paisa Rs69.05 on 7 million shares; FFC-Jordan Fertiliser higher 
Rs1.05 on 5 million shares; Engro Chemical firm Rs3.95 at Rs105.95 
on 4 million shares; and Adamjee Insurance higher by Rs3.65 on 
3.200 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by ICI Pakistan up 25 paisa 
at Rs8.45 on 3 million shares; Telcard higher 90 paisa on 3.410 
million shares; KESC easy five paisa on 1.013 million shares; Sui 
Northern up 25 paisa on 1.298 million shares; Japan Power firm 10 
paisa on 0.966 million shares; MCB up 20 paisa on 0.815 million 
shares and Southern Electric lower 10 paisa on 0.747 million 
shares.
    
Defaulting companies: Shares of Salman Noman and Suzuki Motorcycle 
came in for active selling and ended lower by 35 and 75 paisa on 
1,000 and 3,500 shares. Gammon Pakistan was also marked down by 
five paisa on 2,000 shares.
    
Board meetings: Taj Textiles, Nafees Cotton on March 6; Yousuf 
Weaving, Kohinoor Spinning, Chakwal Spinning and United Sugar on 
March 8; and Pakistan Tobacco on March 17.

AND so the Indians came, and were accorded right-royal treatment. 
They were low-key, they were polite. Pradhan Mantri Atal Behari 
Vajpayee spoke well and meaningfully, as did Wazir-e-Azam Mian 
Nawaz Sharif.
    
The stone-throwers, slogan-mongers, windshield-breakers, and jehad-
fighters should ask themselves exactly where it is they have 
brought their country over the past 50 years. In 1948, had our 
'freedom-fighters' advanced with some purpose and any sort of 
discipline and made for the Srinagar airfield, rather than 
deviating into an orgy of looting at Baramulla, we could have 
seized the Vale and held it. Thereafter, the three wars with India 
have cost us the loss of half of our country, whereas discussions 
and diplomacy have added to our territory - Gwadar - the only 
territory gained since 1947.
    
Today we find Nawaz Sharif's government doing the right thing as 
far as relations with neighbour India is concerned. The opposition 
(if we can call it that), headed by the likes of Messrs Tahirul 
Qadri, Aslam Beg, Chattha, Nasrullah, and Ms Benazir Bhutto oppose 
purely for the sake of opposing. They matter little. The sole party 
to attempt to cause a physical impediment to the Sharif-Vajpayee 
meeting on our soil was the unelectable and unelected Jama'at, 
headed by Qazi Hussain Ahmad and his street-forces.
    
Why do the opposers of friendship not try to learn from history? It 
takes years of sustained effort to overcome the bitterness caused 
by past enmity. Take France and Germany. From 1870 to 1945, the two 
countries fought three destructive wars, all to do with territorial 
gains and losses.
    
The war of 1870 was swift and decisive. Then came World War 1, 
fought over four long bitter years from 1914-1918, which cost the 
lives of almost 1.5 million Frenchmen and marginally less Germans. 
World War 2, lasted for six years during which over 600,000 
Frenchmen and 4.5 million Germans were killed. The impregnable 
Maginot Line and the mighty Siegfried Line proved useless.
    
When Germany was divided in 1945, no one doubted that one day it 
would reunite, but few alive today thought this would happen in 
their lifetime. But it did. It was all a question of time - time, 
the great healer - and circumstances. Germany is one today, and 
France and Germany stand united in a united Europe.
    
As for Qazi Hussain Ahmad, he is not as scary as his press photos 
and his fiery utterances make him out to be. A year or so ago, one 
of his naib-amirs came calling to tell me that his Amir was in 
Karachi for a Jama'at conference and it was his 'khwahish' to call 
on me. I would call on Qazi, I replied. So, I was invited to 
dinner.
    
The Qazi ran true to form, itching for confrontation, ready for a 
fight. The preliminaries dispensed with, he announced that he reads 
what I write and does not agree with any of it. As our conversation 
went along, he conceded he agreed with certain points. By the end 
of the evening, he admitted that he agreed with the larger part of 
what I wrote.
    
He was keen to discuss religion. I was not. He asked when the 
Zoroastrians, the Parsis, had first come to Karachi. In 1847 or so, 
I said, but he heard 1947. (With him as is the case with far too 
many in this country, the world was created in 1947.) Was it in 
that year we ran from Iran, he asked? That was over 1300 years ago, 
I explained, when the Zoroastrians suffered oppression and 
persecution by the conquering Arab Muslims and decided to leave for 
more peaceful shores. At this, he banged his fists on the table, 
told me I was wrong, that Mussalmans never commit 'zulum.'
    
I reminded Qazi of the Battle of Qadisiya. (Before Yasdezird III 
sat upon the throne of Iran, the Muslim Arabs, driven by poverty 
and religious fervour, had begun to attack the rich lands bordering 
their deserts. In 636 AD they overran Syria and Mesopotamia and met 
the Imperial Iranian Army at Qadisiya. A bitter battle was fought 
and the Arabs were victorious.) I reminded him of the oppression 
that started thereafter. But, I said, I am not interested in what 
happened over 13 centuries ago and am certainly not willing to 
argue or fight about it, so let's agree that there was no 
persecution. Then why did you leave Iran and come to India, he 
asked?
    
The Zoroastrians had set sail for better climes, for the largely 
uninhabited island of Madagascar where the 'aabo-hawa' was 
excellent, food grew in abundance, and the wildest of animals were 
fun-loving apes. During the voyage our spirited navigators imbibed 
to such an extent, befuddling their senses, and they sailed off-
course, eventually landing at Surat, on the West Coast of India. 
Tired, there they stayed, and were welcomed by the benign monarch 
Jadev Rana. There ended that tack.
    
Qazi again took off on his favourite topic, reminding me that I 
lived in a Muslim country. I needed no reminding on that score, I 
assured him. Whereupon he picked up a knife. Were someone to hold 
this at your throat and tell you he would kill you unless you 
recite the Holy Kalma, what would be your reaction, he asked? I 
requested him to put down the knife, recited the Kalma for him, 
explaining that I was not willing to die for my religion and 
certainly did not wish to die for his.
    
Thereafter he adjudged me to be a reasonable man, and we parted as 
friends.
    
The cynics say that the Indians are wily and capable of inveigling 
us into situations from which we will not be able to extricate 
ourselves. Who is to blame if we are inveigled? Pragmatic they are. 
They know what they want and they know what they can get. One 
story, symbolic though it may be, augments the point.
    
In 1965, the powerful Bombay-based consortium Associated Cement 
Company (ACC) owned two excellent well-run cement manufacturing 
units, one at Wah, one at Rohri. No profits were being repatriated 
to India and there was no hope of any Pakistani buying the units 
and remitting the sales proceeds. The Hindu and Parsi directors 
met, decided it would be wise to abide by the premise of the old 
saying "Wania mooche neechee" (no English phrase literally 
translates this). They had done their homework and knew there was 
but one man in Pakistan to whom they could talk, with whom they 
could settle, and who would deliver what he promised. That man was 
the Nawab of Kalabagh, Ayub Khan's Governor of West Pakistan.
    
The Chairman of ACC, Dharamsey Khatau, was asked by the Board to 
meet Kalabagh. His instructions : "Pooroo kari avo." Khatau arrived 
with his director, Bobby Mistry. Mahmud Alam, then looking after 
the affairs of ACC in Pakistan, asked Kalabagh if he would meet the 
two. Of course, was the answer, and they will stay as my guests 
whilst in Lahore. Alam thanked him, and then quietly informed the 
household comptroller who was standing by that Dharamsey was a 
vegetarian. Kalabagh overheard the exchange and butted in, "As long 
as Khatau is under my roof, no meat will be served at my table." 
Throughout Khatau's stay Kalabagh ate daal-bhaat, dahi, and 
tarkari.
    
Khatau proposed a price and said that over a specified period of 
time India would accept cement across the border in lieu of cash. 
The Nawab nodded, and said it seemed reasonable, and asked Alam if 
Pakistan could deliver. Yes, came the answer. "Done," pronounced 
Kalabagh.
    
Then came the '65 war. Many politicians tried to persuade Kalabagh 
that the two plants could justifiably be taken over as enemy 
property without any compensation beng paid to the Indians. "Over 
my dead body," said the Nawab, "my promise will be kept."
    
Thinking and attitudes have changed, gentlemen of their word are 
now few and far between. When the Pradhan Mantri dined with our 
Wazir-e-Azam, Nawaz did not eat dhal-baat. The banquet menu read : 
"Cream of Mushroom, Assorted Breads/Katlama; Lahori Fried Fish, 
Channa Masala; Paya Curry, Paneer Kofta Masala, Taka Tin, Curry 
Pakora, Seekh Kebab, Palak Paneer, Chicken Karahi, Sarson ka 
Saag,Vegetable Pillau, Roti, Kulcha, Makai di Roti; Gajjar ka 
Halwa, Pethay ka Halwa, Gulab Jamon;" all accompanied by Lassi.
    
India will not give up Kashmir. To hope that it will do so by our 
merely asking for it is folly. First things first - we, and they, 
must ensure that no more Kashmiri lives are lost through the fault 
of either side. Talks and more talks must continue, on and on. 
Nawaz will have to make a reciprocal trip to India, after having 
practised squeezing himself into and out of a Maruti.

IN the wake of the recent presidential elections in Nigeria, there 
have been the usual allegations of vote rigging. Olu Falae, 
trailing with 11 million votes to winner Obasanjo's 18 million, has 
accused his rival of ballot stuffing on a 'monumental' scale.
    
So what else is new? It seems that no election is possible in a 
developing democracy without similar charges from the loser. Tom 
Stoppard, the brilliant British playwright, once wrote: "Democracy 
is not about voting; it is about counting." Extending this epigram, 
one can add that democracy is also about accepting the result of 
the count. But from Lahore to Lagos, it has become a tradition for 
unsuccessful candidates to cry 'foul' after every election.
    
In far too many instances, alas, it is not entirely a case of sour 
grapes. Given the power and patronage victory brings, and the 
inevitable persecution the loser is subjected to, an electoral 
exercise in the Third World takes on all the intensity and ferocity 
of gladiatorial combat. In Pakistan, we have seen at close hand the 
results of electoral victory and defeat. One ex-PM's father has 
been dragged to jail, and another's husband spends the time his 
wife is not in power in prison. Both acts of vengeance were 
committed in the name of a one-sided accountability process 
launched by the party in power against the opposition.

In the late eighties, there was general euphoria as democratic 
movements toppled autocratic regimes around the world. The process 
of democratization was triggered by the success of Aquino in the 
Philippines, and gathered momentum until the harshest dictatorship 
was forced to make some concessions to the will of the people. But 
a decade of relative democracy has provided us with mixed results.
    
With greater freedom of the press has come the inevitable flood of 
accusations of corruption and incompetence in high places. These 
charges, too often true, have tarnished the system and those 
politicians and parties working within it. Investigative reporters 
have exposed huge scams, and members of the opposition have 
ventilated them on the floor of parliament. Simultaneously, there 
is a growing worldwide awareness of the economic cost of 
corruption. Thus, the international media now carries a multitude 
of stories about wrongdoing in developing nations.
    
One factor compounding the fiscal pressures faced by many emerging 
democracies is that the last decade has witnessed a steady decline 
in bilateral assistance. Countries like Pakistan are struggling to 
balance their books as American and Arab aid has slowed to a 
trickle for a variety of reasons. As a consequence, they have been 
forced to turn to commercial banks as well as the World Bank and 
the IMF. The first extract very high interest from governments 
teetering on the edge of bankruptcy, while the latter two impose 
strict conditions. Both carry a very heavy political, social and 
economic price tag.
    
With this worsening economic scenario has come a deterioration in 
the law and order situation as unemployed and frustrated young men 
join sectarian, ethnic and openly criminal gangs. A corrupt and 
inefficient law enforcement machinery is unable to arrest this 
rising tide of criminality, and the government becomes increasingly 
unpopular, with people comparing its performance unfavourably with 
their memory of despotic rule.
    
Against this backdrop of discontent and the huge backlog of unmet 
needs that is inherent in underdevelopment, the opposition has a 
sitting target in the shape of the government of the day. As soon 
as a leader and his party are sworn in, political rivals begin 
plotting their downfall. The entire electoral process is called 
into question, and groups and alliances are formed to topple the 
elected government. This cycle is then repeated when fresh 
elections are held.
    
Given these problems in the system as it is practised in emerging 
democracies, it is relevant to ask whether democracy is indeed the 
answer in such backward societies. When largely illiterate voters 
elect corrupt and incompetent leaders time after time, people have 
begun to question the utility of the system.
    
This question is best answered with a counter-question: what does 
one replace democracy with? Long and bitter experience with 
military rule has shown us that the most flawed democracy is 
preferable to dictatorship. People tend to forget that by 
definition, there is no freedom of expression under martial law. 

Thus, most of the scams and abuses of power committed during this 
period remain hidden from public view. And as there is no 
parliament, nobody can question the junta's acts of omission and 
commission. Hence on the surface, at least, there is an impression 
of honest and competent government.
    
The reality, however, is very different. A banker friend recently 
made the point that during the Zia era, loans from foreign sources 
as well as domestic debts shot up without any visible projects to 
show for them. For example, non-bank borrowing rose from 1.9 per 
cent of the GDP in 1981 to 4.5 per cent in 1989. There were no IMF 
conditionalities to make life hard for the late dictator. But over 
the last decade, both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif have striven 
to bring the budget deficit under control by containing government 
expenditure.
    
But if there were no major projects launched during that decade, 
where did all the money go? Apart from some well-known cases, 
defence colonies around the country are dotted with well-appointed, 
palatial houses. How they were financed is an open secret. At the 
time when the armed forces were in charge, there was no question of 
investigative reports being published in the press. Now, hardly a 
day passes without a major story exposing one politician or 
another.
    
So when we compare the performance of democratic leaders with that 
of their autocratic predecessors, we need to put things in 
perspective. In the "good old days" of Ayub, Yahya and Zia, 
opponents and critics could be thrown arbitrarily in jail without 
any mention of due process. This still happens, but our superior 
judiciary still protects the individual against the state. An 
exuberantly free press keeps politicians and government 
functionaries on their toes. It is true that in the absence of 
enforceable libel laws, reporters and editors often go overboard by 
printing unsubstantiated reports that smear individuals without 
giving them a chance to defend themselves. Nevertheless, we now 
have access to information that was denied us during the dark days 
of dictatorship.

So all in all, when we decry democracy and mock politicians (albeit 
with good reason), we need to remember that with all its flaws, we 
really have no alternative but to make the system work.

<a name="sril">Sri Lanka manage to make 189 for four to Pakistan's 398</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, March 5: Pakistan ended second day of the five-day Asian 
Test Championship game in a commanding position, thanks to an 
excellent maiden century by Wajahatullah Wasti and fine knocks by 
Yousuf Youhana, Moin Khan, Imran Nazir and effective bowling by 
Saqlain Mushtaq at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday.
    
In reply to Pakistan's formidable first innings total of 398, Sri 
Lankans were struggling at 189 for four when the two umpires David 

Shepherd (England) and Rudi Koertzen (South Africa) stopped the 
game at 5:26 pm due to bad light rather than extending the play 
till 5:45 pm as planned.
    
If opener Wajahatullah held one end to help Pakistan reach 398 in 
102.1 overs in 420 minutes, opener Russel Arnold hit a solid knock 
of 81 in 206 minutes to keep Sri Lanka's hopes of qualifying for 
the final of the competition. Saqlain Mushtaq dealt three deadly 
blows to make the visiting team struggle during the post-tea 
session.
    
Russel Arnold faced all the five Pakistani bowlers used by skipper 
Wasim Akram, including himself, boldly. A model of concentration 
and application, Arnold faced 135 balls and hit thirteen 
exquisitely-timed boundaries in his unbeaten knock because he did 
not spare any loose delivery bowled by young pacemen Fazle Akbar 
and Shahid Nazir. Arnold looked well-set for a well-deserved 
century. Arnold saw four batsmen crashing on the other end but kept 
his nerves till draw of stumps.
    
Saqlain Mushtaq again proved why he was rated so highly as a 
spinner by destroying the Sri Lanka top-order batting after Fazle 
Akbar had broken the opening partnership which yielded 84 runs. 
Avishka Gunawardene tried to hook Fazle Akbar but only succeeded in 
top-edging it to young Imran Nazir at deep fine leg.
    
Earlier, Pakistan's first innings closed at 398, twenty minutes 
after the lunch break. The innings lasted 102.1 overs. Atapattu ran 
in a few steps from mid-off to take a good catch of Shahid Nazir 
(10), who tried to hoist Pramodya Wickremasinghe out of the ground 
but holed out the catch. Shahid Nazir was the last Pakistani out. 
He was Wickremasinghe's sixth victim, who conceded 103 runs to 
emerge as the most successful Sri Lanka bowler.
    
The overnight batsmen Wajahatullah Wasti and Yousuf Youhana 
continued good batting and both extended their fourth-wicket 
partnership from 87 to 178 before being separated. Both had batted 
cautiously on Thursday but thrashed the Sri Lanka bowlers on Friday 
morning to plunder quick runs obviously under the instructions of 
the team management.
    
Off-spinner Ruwan Kalpage succeeded in breaking the stubborn stand 
with the fifth ball of his tenth over. A lapse in Yousuf Youhana's 
concentration cost him dearly when he looked well set for a 
century. He came forward to drive an off-break of Kalpage but could 
not control his shot and the bowler himself held a fine, low catch 
during his follow-through. The partnership between Yousuf and 
Wajahatullah lasted 187 minutes. Yousuf hit a polished knock of 83 
on 152 balls. Besides hitting Bandaratilleke over long on boundary 
for a six, Yousuf hit 11 boundaries mostly through elegant drives 
and cuts.
    
Kalpage claimed his second and last wicket of the innings on catch 
of the match swooped by Gunawardene at silly point on last ball of 
his tenth over. Shahid Afridi powerfully drove the first ball he 
faced into Gunawardene's mid-riff, leaving the fielder writhing in 
pain after affecting that catch. Both wickets fell at the total of 
283. Wajahatullah Wasti played the first ball of Kalpage's 11th 
over to deprive the off-spinner of a hat-trick.

<a name="canw">Pakistan can win Azlan Shah hockey</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 4: Pakistan team has all the ingredients required 
to win the forthcoming Azlan Shah Hockey Tournament at Kuala Lumpur 
and also to repeat its performance at the coming Champions Trophy 
at Brisban in June.
     
This was stated by team coach Olympian Shahnaz Coach while talking 
to Dawn here on Thursday.
     
The team has played 20-25 international matches during the last six 
months, he stated. The coach said that Pakistan, being the most 
experienced side, should win Azlan Shah Tournament in the Malaysian 
capital, starting on April 2.
     
Former olympian Shahnaz said that all the team are in the re-
building process and the new-look Pakistan team has tuned up well 
during the last six months.
     
He maintained that the nine-match series with India, besides 
polishing the skills of the players, has done wonders with their 
moral. "A win is a win whether it is against Europeans or Asians 
and Pakistan was without any win since 1994," he Olympian said.
     
Shahnaz stated that the recently concluded series has allowed 
Pakistan to test its players. "We have given every player a good 
chance to show his performance. Therefore, now we clearly know 
where each player stands", he said.
    
He further said that since Indians have taken up a strategy of 
attacking in the Asian style and defending in European, it helped 
Pakistani team to gain experience of tight marking and pressure 
tackling.
     
He commended the performance of the team, who travelled a 1000 
miles during the longest series ever played by Pakistan. We have 
found two nippy wingers in Mohammad Irfan and Asim. In Atif Bashir 
we have a scoring spearhead. The centre-halfs Mohammad Saqlain and 
Mubashir need improvement but they played well. Similarly the 
keepers have shown improvement, the coach said.
     
Commenting on the drawbacks in defence, Shahnaz agreed that the 
weakness was there and required extra work.
     
Pakistan conceded 53 penalty corners during the series out of which 
seven were converted. On the other hand Pakistan scored 10 goals on 
35 penalty corners. Overall Pakistan slammed 27 against 21 goals 
scored by India.
     
"Although, there are loopholes in the defence, the forwardline also 
failed to assist the defence in the Pakistan leg of the series, 
pointed out the coach.

<a name="sale">Saleh Muhammad beats Farhan to win National snooker title</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE,  Feb  28: Showing consistency and  artistic  game, Saleh 
Muhammad defeated Farhan Mirza by eight frames to  six  in the 
final to win the 24th National Snooker Championship  at  the 
Lahore Gymkhana on Sunday evening.
     
It was a neck-and-neck race till the 12th frame when  both tied at 
6-6. However, Saleh Muhammad put pressure on Farhan Mirza in the 
last two frames to win 89-25 and 70-11 to clinch the championship. 
As Saleh Muhammad pocketed balls with  consistency and  claimed 
the 14th frame rather easily at 70-11, he flung  his arms  in  air 
and a select gathering of snooker  lovers  at  the Lahore Gymkhana 
gave him a standing ovation.
    
Saleh won the  final 77-29,  27-64, 0-77, 70-57, 69-59, 69-49, 63-
50, 12-75,  14-106, 98-37, 24-70, 1-70, 89-25, 70-11.
     
One  must  also  give  credit to  Farhan  Mirza,  who  was 
brilliant in patches. At times, Farhan rose to great heights  but 
frittered  away  chances in some other frames. That  brought  his 
downfall. Farhan had six breaks as against four registered by the 
champion Saleh Muhammad. During the final, Farhan Mirza also  had 
the highest break of 83 during the ninth frame, which he won by a 
big wide of 106-14.
     
At conclusion of the championship, Punjab Governor  Shahid Hamid 
gave away the prizes and souvenirs. Saleh Muhammad  got  a 
beautiful  trophy and a cash prize of Rs 55,000. He also won  the 
prize for the highest break. Farhan Mirza received the trophy and a 
prize of Rs 30,000. The losing semi-finalists Khurrum Agha  and 
Zartash  Husain  got Rs 13,000, each.
    
The  governor lauded the efforts of Pakistan Billiards  and Snooker 
Association  for the promotion of the game in  the  country. 
Pakistan  Billiards and Snooker Association president Ali  Asghar 
Valika said that the hard-work was bearing fruit and Pakistan has 
achieved the distinction of winning gold medal in the Asian Games 
through  Shaukat Ali and World Amateur and Asian  titles  through 
Muhammad  Yousaf. He said that snooker will win more  laurels  as 
many  talented youngsters like Khurrum Agha were emerging on  the 
national scene.
     
Saleh  Muhammad began the 15-frame final in  an  imposing style  by 
winning the first frame at 77-29. Saleh had a break  of 38 in this 
frame. However, Farhan Mirza levelled the score 1-1 by wining the 
second frame at 27-64. Farhan registered a break of 48 during  this 
frame. He won the third frame at  77-0.  But  Saleh registered a 
break of 32 in the fourth frame to win that at 70-57 and thus 
levelled the score at two frames all.
     
Saleh  hit  another  break of 32 and  took  2-1  lead  by winning 
the fifth frame at 69-59. Not only that, he claimed  the sixth 
frame 69-49 and the seventh frame 63-50 to widen the  lead 5-2.
     
Farhan came back into the final by hitting a break of 40 and 
winning the eighth frame 75-12. That followed the best  break (83) 
of the final registered by Farhan. He walked away with  the ninth 
frame at 106-14. Thus Farhan narrowed the lead of Saleh  to 4-5.
     
Saleh increased the lead to 6-4 by winning the 10th  frame 98-37. 
Saleh registered a break of 65 during this frame.
