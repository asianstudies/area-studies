-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Sept 17: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Friday expressed 
Pakistan's "unswerving resolve to continue to nurturing 
cooperation" with China in all fields of mutual interest.

He said this when he received a six-member Chinese foreign ministry 
delegation in connection with the 50th anniversary of the founding 
of the People's Republic of China. He also highlighted the special 
celebrations planned by the government here to mark the Chinese 
landmark event.

Wang Yi, the Chinese assistant foreign minister who headed the 
team, conveyed to the prime minister greetings from the Chinese 
leadership and expressed the confidence that Pakistan- China 
relations in the 21st Century would develop into a "comprehensive 
partnership for peace and stability both at regional and global 
levels", an official statement said.

Pakistan's efforts to maintain regional peace and to resolve 
peacefully all outstanding issues with India, including the core 
issue of Kashmir, were underlined by the prime minister.

Mr Nawaz Sharif pointed out the potentially destabilising nature of 
India's nuclear doctrine draft. He stated that the doctrine aimed 
at establishing New Delhi's hegemony over the Indian Ocean sea-
lanes and exposing the countries in the area to a grave security 
threat.

The Chinese delegation leader also reaffirmed his government's 
desire to continue to work for promotion of mutually-beneficial 
relations between the two countries.

TALKS AT FOREIGN MINISTRY: The entire range of bilateral relations 
between Pakistan and China as well as regional and global issues of 
mutual concern came under review at more than four hours of talks 
held here at the foreign office with the Chinese team.

The delegation, assisted by the Chinese ambassador in Islamabad, Li 
Shulin, held talks with the foreign secretary, Shamshad Ahmad, and 
his team of senior officials.

The talks were described to be "in the tradition of extensive 
bilateral consultations" between the two countries to coordinate 
their policies prior to the UN General Assembly session in New 
York.

The global and regional issues of mutual concern, including 
Kashmir, Afghanistan, peace and security situation, coupled with 
nuclear developments in the region, came under extensive review.

Both sides emphasized that the close, friendly relations between 
Pakistan and China were based on mutual trust and confidence and 
commonality of their interests and objectives for peace, stability 
and progress in the region.

Special emphasis was laid on the need for an early and just 
settlement of the Kashmir dispute which was the cause of all 
tensions in South Asia, the officials said.

The Chinese side appreciated Pakistan's initiatives for reducing 
tensions and seeking resolution of all issues, particularly the 
long-standing Kashmir dispute.

The Chinese delegation also appreciated Pakistan's recent peace 
initiative for Afghanistan and the two sides agreed that durable 
peace in the war-torn country could only be achieved through 
negotiations among the Afghan parties.

<a name="cent">Centre to collect toll: Provinces told to hand over highways</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 17: The federal government has directed the 
provinces to hand over the national highways, from where they are 
collecting toll, to the ministry of communications, it was 
announced on Friday.

The federal government has decided that due to financial 
constraints it is necessary that operation of the national highways 
be placed on commercial lines through award of concessions.

Consequently, the Karachi-Hyderabad superhighway and the Grand 
Truck Road will stand transferred to the National Highway Authority 
which will hand them over to the Fauji Foundation and National 
Logistics Cell (NLC) respectively.

The federal government has specifically asked the Punjab government 
to give back five bridges on the GT Road to NHA.

NHA has entered into agreement with NLC for the maintenance of the 
road. Toll will now be collected by NLC. The Punjab government, 
which was earlier collecting toll on these bridges, had opposed the 
federal government move for their handing over to NLC.

The prime minister's directive in this regard stated that all the 
national highways would be operated on commercial lines and the 
revenue generated from these roads would be used for building new 
roads and improving the existing ones.

Operation and maintenance contractors would collect toll from 
traffic on bridges and bypasses. They would be required to ensure 
routine maintenance of the highways and set up and manage weighing 
stations.

The two-paged directive, after making a lengthy introduction of the 
prime minister's desire to lay a network of highways and motorways, 
stated that NHA had signed the first operation and maintenance 
agreement with NLC for the Lahore-Rawalpindi section, N-
5(G.T.Road).

The prime minister's directive said that for making the arrangement 
with NLC commercially feasible, it was necessary that NHA exercised 
full right, vested in it under Article 10(2)(vii) of the NHA Act, 
1991, to levy, collect and cause to collect toll on all national 
highway and roads.

The directive stated:" The prime minister has been pleased to 
direct that the rights to collect toll on the national highways 
wherever presently being exercised by the provincial governments 
will henceforth stand transferred to the federal government/NHA of 
the ministry of communications."

In case of Punjab, the prime minister directed that the right to 
collect toll on the following bridges be immediately transferred to 
the NHA: Ravi Bridge (at Shahdara); Chenab Bridge (South Band); 
Jhelum Bridge; Sutlej Bridge; and Ghazi Ghat Bridge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 14: Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Chief of the Pakistan 
Democratic Alliance, on Tuesday afternoon announced the formation 
of the Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) to continue the struggle for 
dislodging the Nawaz Sharif government.

He also announced that the GDA would stage a historic public 
meeting at Multan at a date to be set later. He said that a public 
rally at Peshawar would be held in the first week of October.

The GDA was formed after a meeting of the opposition leaders from 
all the provinces was held at the residence of Nawabzada Nasrullah 
Khan. It was attended, among others, by PPP Senior Vice Chairman 
Amin Fahim, ANP President Asfandyar Wali Khan, PML-J President Ch 
Hamid Nasir Chattha and PML (Jinnah) President Manzur Wattoo.

Nasrullah Khan, at his press conference, gave the details of the 
treatment meted out to the leaders by the Sindh administration.

He strongly condemned the lathi-charge and tear-gassing of 
senators, MNAs and MPAs at Karachi and Hyderabad and their arrest 
without warrants. He described the strike organised in Karachi and 
Hyderabad a great success.

Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan deplored the deportation of politicians 
from the NWFP, Balochistan and Punjab from Karachi and described 
this step against the concept of Federalism.

He said that the government, led by Nawaz Sharif, had been totally 
isolated and through its actions it showed that it had been 
deprived of the support of public opinion.

In the evening, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan and Chaudhry Hamid Nasir 
Chattha watched the proceedings of the Senate.

The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Aitzaz Ahsan, drew the 
attention of the Chairman Senate Wasim Sajjad to the presence of 
the two distinguished politicians in the visitors gallery. The 
opposition benches greeted the two politicians by thumping their 
desks.

<a name="pmas">PM asks for report on fall in farm growth rate</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rauf Klasra

ISLAMABAD, Sept 16: The prime minister secretariat has directed the 
ministry of food, agriculture and livestock (MINFAL) to submit a 
comprehensive report in the backdrop of what appears to be a 
virtual collapse of the farm sector in recent years.

According to a directive No 706/99-SSC, the MINFAL has been 
informed that the matter is of 'most urgent nature', and should be 
treated on top priority basis and reach the PM secretariat within 
one week time', the letter said.

Official sources claimed that five MINFAL commissioners of minor 
crops, special crops, wheat, cotton & sugarcane and senior 
Agriculture engineer, director general Soil Survey (Lahore)), DG 
Federal Seed Certification (Islamabad) and head of Pakistan Central 
Cotton Committee (PCCC) have been directed to submit their reports 
to the PM secretariat for evaluation.

Earlier,sources said the prime minister had also expressed serious 
concern over the drastic fall in agriculture growth rate from 3.82% 
in '97-98 to 0.35% in '98-99. And in this regard, an explanation 
from agriculture ministry was sought some two months back.

Sources said, in its previous report to the PM, the MINFAL 
authorities had blamed unfavourable weather conditions responsible 
for low farm output. But, sources think that the fresh directive 
showed that the explanation had failed to convince the prime 
minister who is reportedly not satisfied with the performance of 
the agriculture ministry and that was that is why, a fresh report 
has been sought to have a complete analysis of agricultural 
debacle.

Official sources believed that drastic fall in farm growth rate in 
'98-99 has dealt a serious blow to government's claim that it was 
giving top priority to agriculture sector.

Officials said in '97-98 new support price policy of wheat and 
sugarcane had helped greatly the farm sector and there was a bumper 
crop of wheat, sugarcane, rice, potato, maize etc. But, in the 
outgoing year ('98-99), support price policy was discontinued 
despite increase in the cost of production of different major 
crops.

They said the government had failed to implement support prices it 
had itself fixed for procurement of sugarcane, potato, maize etc 
which resulted in huge financial losses to growers. These factors, 
led to negative growth in the farm sector in '98-99. Sources also 
claimed that the fact that the MINFAL functions without a full time 
secretary for the last 10 months has contributed to the disarray in 
the sector and the MINFAL has failed to frame policies for the 
revival of farm sector.

<a name="ussu">US suggests Pakistan, India should hold talks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

WASHINGTON, Sept 15: The State Department reacted coolly on 
Wednesday to proposals that it intervene and mediate the dispute 
over Kashmir between India and Pakistan.

Spokesman James Rubin said US policy on the matter remained the 
same and that no mediation efforts would be attempted until and 
unless both India and Pakistan requested help.

"We would be prepared to be helpful if India and Pakistan sought 
our assistance in mediation," he said, adding: "They have not done 
so."

Rubin said Washington remained of the opinion that the best way to 
deal with disputed territory - over which India and Pakistan have 
fought two wars and nearly came to a third earlier this year - was 
for the two countries to solve it between themselves.

"The key solution is for India and Pakistan to develop the kind of 
bilateral relationship that permits problems to be solved through 
direct dialogue," he said.

Rubin's comments came in response to a call from US lawmakers, to 
be made public on Thursday, for the United States to take an active 
role in the crisis by appointing a special mediator.

At least 62 lawmakers have signed a letter making the request 
saying it would be irresponsible for the United States not to act 
since both India and Pakistan now have atomic weapons and Kashmir 
is a potential flashpoint for nuclear war.-AFP

<a name="sixt">Sixty more battalions sent to Kashmir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SRINAGAR (Occupied), Sept 16: India has sent massive troop 
reinforcements to occupied Kashmir to counter the resurgent freedom 
fighters.

"Sixty battalions of the army have been moved into the state,," 
said occupied Kashmir's police chief.

He said a major offensive would be launched against Mujahideen, who 
have intensified their activities following the Kargil conflict and 
in the run-up to the general election.

The Kargil conflict required a large redeployment of forces along 
the Line of Control, easing the pressure on Mujahideen operating in 
the held valley and other areas.

"Instead of hiding in the forests, these militants came down near 
the villages and there were incidents where they managed to sneak 
into heavily guarded camps," Jagat said.

The Mujahideen have enforced a boycott of the ongoing elections in 
held Kashmir, attacking candidates, party supporters and election 
officials.

"In the afternoon, an IED (improvised explosive device) fitted in a 
gas cylinder planted by militants near Iqbal market in Sopore went 
off when a bus carrying security force personnel on election duty 
passed by that way," a police statement said. Reuters/AFP

HYDERABAD, Sept 13: Complete strike was observed amid fear of 
violence here on Monday, the second day of the two-day strike 
called by the opposition alliance against the use of brute force on 
political leaders and activists in Hyderabad and Karachi.

Except for two powerful cracker explosions at Hyderabad Chowk in 
the evening and one at Chotki Ghitti, no untoward incident was 
reported from anywhere in the city.

Main markets of Tower, Timber Market, Gul Centre, District Council 
Shopping Centre, Station Road, Resham Bazaar, Lajpat Road and all 
units of Latifabad remained closed throughout the day.

The local administration continued blockade of all major roads. The 
people were subjected to body search at police posts and snap 
checking was conducted by patrol units. The main grain market and 
fruit market remained open, however, attendance in schools and 
offices was almost nil.

<a name="twoi">Two Indian soldiers handed over to ICRC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Sept 16: Pakistan on Thursday handed over two Indian 
soldiers, taken prisoners last month in an attack on the Pakistani 
positions across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, to the 
International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).

The two Indian soldiers, Lance Naik Ram Singh No:2984373 and Sepoy 
Bajinder Singh No:2996593 of 3rd Rajput Battalion of 9th Indian 
Regiment, "were released on humanitarian grounds after ICRC 
certified that they were found to be in sound health," said a 
Foreign Office statement.

The two Indian soldiers were handed over to the ICRC officials at 
9.15 p.m.

The Indian armymen were captured by the Pakistan Army during an 
Indian attack on Pakistani post in Shyok-Turkok Sector across the 
LoC in Kashmir on August 30.

"While the Government of Pakistan has been willing to release these 
two Indian soldiers, the Indian government has procrastinated for 
nearly two weeks before agreeing to take them back," the statement 
said.

On Tuesday last, when all the arrangements had been made to hand 
over the Indian soldiers to the ICRC, the Indian government 
insisted upon a last minute pre-condition that they should not be 
handed over to the ICRC in the presence of media. The handing over 
was, therefore, postponed.

"Pakistan has all along stressed the involvement of ICRC and 
international media in order to preempt the possibility of Indian 
propaganda of maltreatment of soldiers as had been done by India at 
the time of return of six bodies of Indian soldiers during the 
Kargil crisis."-APP

<a name="pppr">PPP raps Saif for more cases against Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 15: The PPP said on Wednesday that Ehtesab Bureau 
chief's disclosure that 10 more references against opposition 
leader Benazir Bhutto were in the pipeline, had exposed the "farce 
and vindictive" nature of the accountability process.

Addressing a news conference at the Bilawal House, Sindh PPP chief 
Nisar Khuhro said the threat indicated nervousness of the 
government owing to massive public support to anti-government 
rallies.

Mr Khuhro said the country and the people had been isolated and 
humiliated because of the ill-conceived policies of the regime 
which had unleased a reign of terror for voicing the dissent.

He said the regime, which had equated dissent with treason, had 
forced the people to commit suicide, and to come out on the streets 
to fight for their rights.

Mr Khuhro said the "farce" of Ehtesab was also exposed from the 
fact that Senator Saifur Rahman had "boasted" that he also had 
references against some members of the ruling party, but had not 
proceeded against them. On the other hand there was no let-up in 
media trail of the leader of opposition.

The PPP leader regretted that Ms Bhutto's petition against the 
media trail was still pending in the court. But, he added, her 
character assassination by the state-controlled electronic media 
was continuing.

He said the cases against Nawaz Sharif and Saifur Rahman were not 
being taken up but references against Ms Bhutto were being pursued 
with great zeal.

The former federal minister, Nawab Yusuf Talpur, cautioned the 
Ehtesab Bureau chief against attempt to attach Ms Bhutto's 
property.

Refuting the charges of corruption against himself in the tractor 
scheme, Mr Talpur said that the tractor he had offered at Rs150,000 
was being provided by the present regime at Rs450,000.

Aftab Shahban Mirani alleged that 110 air-hostesses had been 
recruited in the PIA on the orders of the prime minister without 
following any procedure.

He demanded of the prime minister to declare how much income tax 
had he paid during the past 10 years as he had taken bank loans of 
Rs970 million.

N.D. Khan accused the regime of being a threat to national security 
and called for its early removal. He accused the prime minister of 
plundering national wealth and cited in this context the land 
acquisition for Mera Ghar scheme. Mr Khuhro demanded action against 
Senator Saifur Rahman for the "scandal".

Akbar Lasi alleged that Rs40 billion had been taken from the 
Employees Old Age Benefit fund for the Mera Ghar project.

<a name="naik">Naik denies making remarks on Kargil</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 16: Former foreign secretary Niaz A. Naik has 
denied making such remarks as reported by an Urdu daily of Karachi 
that" the programme and the informal diplomacy which could have led 
to the resolution of Kashmir dispute by September/ October this 
year was derailed by Kargil" or that " there was no coordination 
between the armed forces and the civilian leadership".

In a signed press statement issued in Islamabad on Thursday, Mr 
Naik said he had never made such remarks, nor would he indulge in 
any such "irresponsible speculation".

Reacting to the report appearing in daily Jang of Sept 14, he said 
that indeed he would not have considered this baseless report 
worthy of a reaction from him but for the fact that it was causing 
serious misunderstandings and controversies which also undermined 
his integrity and credentials.

Mr Naik said he was a retired diplomat and had been involved in 
Track 11 efforts in good faith and for a good cause." I cannot 
afford my reputation to be sullied by irresponsible and malicious 
reporting".

He expected that the newspaper would remedy the situation and 
redress the damage caused by the misreporting. He said he reserved 
the right to take legal action against the paper.

Mr Naik said that following a Pakistan-China Friendship Society 
function to which he had been invited as keynote speaker, when 
refreshments were being served he was surrounded by a large number 
of reporters who put many questions to him relating to the informal 
diplomacy and the Kargil issue.

Mr Naik said he had thought it appropriate not to make any comments 
or respond to any question. He said that had he stated what had 
been wrongfully attributed to him, all newspapers whose 
correspondents were present on the occasion would have carried the 
story.

Mr Naik pointed out that immediately after his address, he had 
answered a few questions put to him from the rostrum about his 
visit to New Delhi, which did not appear in any newspaper.

<a name="wash">Washington to continue working with Nawaz govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Sept 16: The State Department said on Wednesday the US 
would continue to work with the Nawaz Sharif government as it was 
its policy to work with "the Government of Pakistan."

"Our policy is based on working with the Government of Pakistan, 
and we will continue to work with the Sharif government," Spokesman 
Jamie Rubin told his regular briefing when asked about the demand 
by opposition leader Imran Khan that the US should not support the 
present "corrupt" government.

The spokesman was asked: "The former (cricket captain) of Pakistan 
and now a politician, speaking at the CSIS the other day, said that 
the US and the IMF should not support the corrupt government of 
Nawaz Sharif, number one. 

"Number two, Mr.Sharif has cancelled his visit to the UN. He was 
supposed to meet with the secretary and the president, and I 
understand, according to Mr.Khan, that because he does not want to 
sign the CTBT which he promised last year next year he will sign at 
the UN."

Rubin replied: "Well, may be Mr.Khan has developed the role of 
spokesman for Mr. Sharif and, therefore, if you have any other 
questions about Mr. Sharif's intentions or desires, you can direct 
further questions at Mr. Khan. But from our standpoint, we believe 
that the path we've taken in working with Pakistan on a number of 
issues, but also imposing restrictions as a result of their nuclear 
testing, is the right course. Our policy is based on working with 
the Government of Pakistan, and we will continue to work with the 
Sharif government."

Officials also clarified that Mr.Imran Khan could not see Assistant 
Secretary Karl Inderfurth because the US official had a sudden 
engagement and their meeting was called off at the last minute.

A senior American official said that Imran Khan did come to the 
State Department to meet Inderfurth but instead he could see 
Inderfurth's Deputy Mr. Eastham.

South and West Asia, regions plagued by ethnic and territorial 
conflicts, drug trading and terrorism.

The participants at the Conference for Interaction and Confidence 
Building Measures in Asia (CICA) declared a special commitment to 
wiping out terrorism from the world's most populous continent, home 
to 3.5 billion people.

The meeting comes at a time when Russia is fighting insurgency in 
its troubled North Caucasus region and a series of terrorist bomb 
attacks in Moscow which have killed more than 200 people.

"Asia is torn apart by conflicts and mistrust," said Kazakhstan's 
president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who first proposed the forum in 
1992. "Special importance must be attached to terrorism and 
extremism because of the volatile situation in Asia today."

The conference includes Russia and ex-Soviet states Tajikistan, 
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Azerbaijan. The other members are 
Pakistan, China, Mongolia, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Israel, Egypt, 
Turkey and the Palestine.

Kyrgyzstan is battling guerillas, members of groups which are 
gaining popularity in Central Asia.

Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the fight against 
terrorism and extremism was of the greatest concern in view of the 
events in the Caucasus and Moscow.

Many CICA members could be directly affected by developments in 
the Caucasus, he said.

"The resolution commits member states to desist from aiding 
organizations and groups engaging in terrorism and to prevent their 
activities on their territories," Ivanov told reporters.

Despite the agreement, undercurrents of discord between some CICA 
members were evident. Iran said it disapproved of Israel's 
presence, and Pakistan cited the Kashmir issue as a stumbling block 
to peace in the area.

Jan Kubic, General Secretary of the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), said the forum would take time to 
evolve and gradually iron out differences. The OSCE and the UN were 
present as observers.

"It is normal that different participants have different national 
interests and as this is a forum for political dialogue, it is 
natural that they are coming with their concerns," Kubic told 
Reuters in an interview.

"Looking at our own experience, it took us some time to mature and 
to put into practice our own principles," he said. "I have no doubt 
that this is a good beginning for a similar development here."-

<a name="nawa">Nawaz's NY visit cancelled</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Sept 14: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's visit to New 
York, to address the UN General Assembly on September 22, has been 
called off.

The foreign office spokesman, Tariq Altaf, said here on Tuesday 
that the prime minister "has no plan to go to New York". He made 
this one-line response to a question at a news briefing here 
whether Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's programme to visit the United 
States had been finalised.

Mr Altaf said the prime minister had planned to attend the UN 
General Assembly session. However, he added that it was not always 
the case that the head of a government or state attended the 
session.

This time, the PM's proposed visit evoked considerable interest in 
political and diplomatic circles in Islamabad since it was to 
follow the Kargil crisis and the exceptionally-high tension in the 
nuclearized South Asia. 

Particular concern was expressed at the renewed pressure the US 
could mount on Pakistan to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
(CTBT).

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had, at the last General Assembly 
session, declared that his government would sign the CTBT by 
September 1999 in case international coercive atmosphere, 
particularly the economic sanctions imposed by the US Congress on 
Pakistan, was removed.

In Pakistan's view, that has not happened and the possibility of it 
signing the CTBT at present does not exist.

<a name="news">Newsmen deplore setting up of press council</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 15: Representative bodies of journalists observed a 
"black day" on Wednesday to protest against the proposed setting up 
of a press council and against police excesses on newsmen as well 
as the siege of Karachi Press Club.

Speaking at a protest meeting of the Karachi Union of Journalists 
(KUJ), Karachi Press Club and Pakistan Association of Press 
Photographers at the Karachi Press Club, the office-bearers of 
journalists organizations demanded registration of criminal cases 
against the policemen involved in the manhandling of journalists 
during an opposition rally on Sept 11.

A resolution adopted at the meeting unanimously demanded abolition 
of all black laws concerning the press, enactment of an access to 
information act, the abolition of the ministry of information, as 
well as of the government plan to set up a press council.

It demanded that the electronic media be freed from government 
control, and TV, Radio and the APP be given the status of 
autonomous bodies. Demands were also made for an end to the press 
advice system and the use of newsprint quota as a means of 
blackmailing the press.

The resolution declared that unless cases were registered against 
the police officials guilty of assaulting newspapermen and the 
photographers whose equipment was damaged, were fairly compensated, 
the journalistic community would not make itself a part of any 
government or administrative committee set up to investigate the 
matter.

It was also decided that in addition to the KUJ, Rawalpindi-
Islamabad Union of Journalists, Punjab Union of Journalists, Khyber 
Union of Journalists and Balochistan Union of Journalists would 
devise a common strategy to raise their voice against excesses on 
journalists in various parts of Sindh.

The chairman Senate committee on information and broadcasting and 
deputy secretary-general of the Pakistan People's Party, Senator 
Raza Rabbani, in his message deplored the "naked state power used 
against peaceful political activists and journalists on the 11th 
and 12th September at Karachi and Hyderabad" and reiterated support 
to the "just cause and struggle" of the journalist community.

In his message, which was read out by Nisar Khuhro, President of 
Sindh PPP, Sen Rabbani said the regime had embarked on a path of 
dismantling the democratic process, debasing institutions, 
circumventing the Constitution and depriving the federating units 
of their rights guaranteed under law and the Constitution.

<a name="pari">Paris Club allows Pakistan to pay Eurobond dues</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Haris Anwar

KARACHI, Sept 15: Pakistan has paid principal amount of $17.5 
million to two Middle Eastern banks to avoid being first rated 
sovereign to default on Eurobonds.

"We got a one-time permission from the Paris Club to pay two Middle 
Eastern banks, who were holding this amount in put options. This 
was an attempt to avoid being a first bad guy in the international 
market as after this payment Russian maturities were falling ahead 
of Pakistan," a source said.

Well-placed sources said Pakistan had made these payments on June 
21 fell due on Citibank's $150 million bond issue.

But Pakistan could still be the first to default on these bonds as 
Russia was later exempted from bond rescheduling due to its nuclear 
muscles. Pakistan's first bond issue is maturing on December, 1999.

Pakistan paid $7.5 million in principal amount to Gulf 
International Bank and $10 million to Abu Dhabi Investment Agency. 
Put option is a right under which a bond-holder can ask for 
redemption before the actual maturity of the bond.

The Paris Club of sovereign lenders told Pakistan earlier this year 
that it must effectively default on $470 million Eurobonds falling 
due by December 2000 before it would approve a deal to reschedule a 
bilateral loans.

But Pakistan showed some reluctance and continued to pay coupon 
payments on these bonds until Paris Club devised a mechanism how to 
reschedule these instruments.

Pakistan has two floating rate notes (FRNs) and two sovereign 
bonds, totalling over $600 million, of which $470 million will 
mature by December 2000.

According to reports, there has been understanding reached with the 
Paris Club that Pakistan would reschedule these bonds in a manner 
that principal payments were staggered.

Sources, however, said Pakistan's agreement with the London Club of 
creditors prohibited it to give a better deal to bond-holders.

"According to a clause in term-sheet, Pakistan cannot stretch 
maturities better than the London Club of commercial creditors," a 
source in the foreign bank said.

Pakistan has signed a tentative agreement with commercial lenders 
to reschedule its $877 million commercial loans for three years. 
The quarterly payments on principal will start from Jan 1, 2001, 
ending by June 30, 2002 with interest rates ranging from 1 to 1.5 
per cent over LIBOR.

Pakistan has yet to sign a master trade maintenance facility to 
formalize the agreement, which, at present, is under consideration 
of Law Ministry.

Pakistan was chosen as a test case due to its little exposure in 
the international bond market. Other huge borrowers like Romania 
and Ecuador are next in line to get their Eurobonds rescheduled.

But this has put Pakistan into a trouble as rescheduling of 
Eurobonds would further downgrade Pakistan's credit rating, making 
it almost impossible to finance its deficit from these market 
sources.

According to external financing arrangements projected in IMF 
sponsored ESAF programme, Pakistan, still, needs to arrange new 
short- and medium-term commercial loans of about $1.7 billion out 
of total $19 billion external requirements by 2000-01 to avoid 
foreign exchange crisis even during a period of debt relief.

<a name="pmwa">PM wants faster economic recovery</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 15: The federal cabinet here on Wednesday expressed 
its grave concern over the continuous failure of the relevant 
agencies to optimise revenue mobilisation efforts and increase the 
flow of foreign investment.

The cabinet meeting, which was presided over by Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif, also reportedly regretted that the confidence of the 
overseas Pakistanis was still at a very low ebb and they had not 
yet forgotten the experience of the May 1998 FCA freeze.

Later, a high-level ministerial committee was constituted, headed 
by Finance Minister, Ishaq Dar, to prepare a comprehensive package 
aimed at restoring the confidence of the people and investors in 
the banking sector.

The prime minister emphasised the need for bold initiatives and 
said that the proposed package should include legal measures to 
restore the confidence of the people in "our financial sector which 
will stimulate economic revival".

The members of the committee are Minister for Water and Power 
Mr.Gohar Ayub Khan, Minister for Law and Justice, Mr.Khalid Anwar, 
Minister for Labour and Manpower Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and Minister 
of State for Water and Power, Mr.Haleem Siddiqui. The committee 
will submit its recommendations to the cabinet at its next meeting.

The federal cabinet was given a comprehensive briefing by the 
Chairman of the Central Board of Revenue (CBR), Mian Iqbal Farid, 

on the steps taken to improve the tax recovery system and revenue 
collection.

"We have to increase the inflow of foreign investment by 
facilitating the investors and it cannot happen unless we restore 
the confidence of foreign investors," said a ministerial source 
quoting the prime minister. He said that the cabinet was told that 
Rs 6 billion were paid by the salaried classes as income tax, Rs 48 
billion were paid by non-corporate sector while the corporate 
sector paid Rs 24 billion annually.

The prime minister in his comments said that radical measures were 
needed to bring about structural changes in the tax administration 
so that a basis could be laid for not only introducing tax culture 
in the country but also to make the tax system more effective and 
efficient.

The prime minister asked all the ministers to come up with concrete 
suggestions in this regard for consideration in the next meeting of 
the cabinet.

"We have a committee on resource mobilisation and it has formulated 
certain recommendations which will be put up in the next cabinet 
meeting", said Deputy Chairman Planning Commission and Chairman 
Programme 2010 Ahsan Iqbal.

<a name="dars">Dar's visit to focus on suspended loans</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Kamal Siddiqi

KARACHI, Sept 15: As finance minister Ishaq Dar prepares to go 
Washington to attend the annual meetings of the IMF and the World 
Bank in the coming week, at the top of his agenda will be the 
request to restore the suspended loan programme for Pakistan,
under which a tranche of $280 million has been with held by IMF.

Ishaq Dar, however, contends that he is going to Washington to 
attend the meetings of the IMF and the World Bank. Dar is hopeful 
that the talks for the release of the tranche will be finalized 
before he steps on to the plane for Washington. Senior finance 
ministry officials believe otherwise.

For Pakistan, which currently has over $1.5 billion in foreign 
exchange reserves, it is more the IMF endorsement and less the 
actual funds that the government is hoping will be given to it at 
this stage.

"If the IMF resumes its programme by releasing the tranche to 
Pakistan, it will be an endorsement that Pakistan desperately 
needs", says economist Akbar Zaidi. The signal that IMF has 
accepted the deviations that Pakistan has made in its initial 
agreement in January, that paved way for the restoration of the 
$1.6 billion funding programme.

For its part, the IMF is in an unforgiving mood. Despite 
pronouncements to the contrary, it has not taken kindly to the 
Prime Minister's Housing Programme and the inability of Pakistan to 
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a promise that prime 
minister Nawaz Sharif had given in December 1998. While foreign 
minister Sartaj Aziz insists that Pakistan had given the 
precondition that US sanctions against Pakistan be lifted before 
Pakistan signs on the dotted line, IMF officials say that this is 
not the case.

The decision by the prime minister to drop plans to visit the UN 
General Assembly in New York later this month should also be seen 
in this light.

Dar's job has been further complicated by the infighting within the 
cabinet and the political grand-standing of the government.

The letter of intent (LOI), that Dar says will be signed within the 
week has been eluding Pakistan for the past two months. The LOI is 
the basis of the resumption of funding to Pakistan.

As far as the "Apna Ghar" project is concerned, Dar has been a 
strong critic of this, insiders in Islamabad say. But political 
compulsions of the prime minister, especially after the Kargil 
debacle, have forced the PM to take this route. 

The IMF and other donor agencies are unhappy with the programme, 
which is seen as a political gimmick which will leave public sector 
banks holding yet more billions in defaulted loans. Bank say that 
they are against the scheme because it will create a liquidity 
shortage in the market and force interest rates. "The fact of the 
matter is that banks are afraid of the potential defaults of such a 
scheme", said Nadeem Naqvi, an investment advisor with 
International Asset Management Co (IAMC) in Karachi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 16: A five-member committee, constituted by the 
federal cabinet on Wednesday to restore the confidence of the 
foreign investors, discussed here on Thursday the possibility of 
establishing a "separate bank" for overseas Pakistanis.

"We have discussed various proposals including the setting of a 
separate bank for the overseas Pakistanis so that they do not have 
any problem in sending their remittances to Pakistan", said the 
Minister for Labour, Manpower and Overseas Pakistanis, Sheikh 
Rashid Ahmad.

He told Dawn after the meeting, which was chaired by Minister for 
Finance and Commerce Ishaq Dar, that there was a likelihood for 
having a bank which will exclusively deal with the overseas 
Pakistanis. "The bank if established will adequately remove the 
growing problems of the Pakistanis living abroad".

The labour minister said that he had informed the meeting that 
25,000 Pakistanis have been given legal status in Greece while a 
sizable number of Pakistanis currently living in Spain and 
Australia were expected to get the similar status in future. "Then 
there are about 50,000 Pakistanis in Italy who are also expected to 
get a legal status soon", he said adding that the growing number of 
Pakistanis, having legal status in different countries would 
eventually be sending their remittances through a proposed separate 
bank.

The meeting considered various options/incentives aimed at re-
building the confidence of the foreign investors and expatriate 
Pakistanis to invest in Pakistan.

The committee reviewed the level of remittances by expatriate 
Pakistanis on a monthly basis and discussed various measures to 
encourage them to send their remittances through normal banking 
channels instead of "Hundi".

The committee will meet shortly again to consider some specific 
proposals. It was attended by ministers for law and justice, 
manpower and overseas Pakistanis and the minister of state for 
water and power.

<a name="gasc">Gas companies ready to renegotiate prices</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 16: International oil and gas exploration companies 
have told the government that they are ready for renegotiations on 
the prices of gas for "specific short-term period of interim 
relief".

In a representation to the Ministry of Industry, Pakistan Petroleum 
Exploration and Production Companies Association (PPECA) stated 
that the government's attempts to renegotiate producer gas prices 
had reduced the confidence of the investor in Pakistan.

It, however, offered that discussion with the government regarding 
price renegotiations should be on the basis of a specific short-
term period of interim relief after which the petroleum policy 
price would prevail. "This will provide incentives both the 
development of new fields and new exploration expenditure as well 
as providing relief to the economy."

The government and the exploration companies are engaged in 
negotiation on producer gas prices. The government is of the view 
that it is under no obligation to buy gas from the producers if the 
companies fail to agree on price formula.

The association of exploration companies stated that Pakistan had 
attained negative international investor perception due to its 
treatment of IPP investors, freezing of foreign currency accounts 
and concerns about regional stability in the wake of nuclearisation 
and tension with the neighbouring countries.

The exploration companies said that though the government was using 
"legally legitimate loophole to support its negotiation position, 
the industry's confidence had been reduced."

"This lack of confidence is evident in the current low levels of 
drilling activity by the foreign investors in Pakistan as well as 
the dramatic drop in signature of new concession agreements."

The PPECA argued that the government's approach to renegotiate 
long-term gas prices had made the existing projects uncompetitive 
as well as dampening the enthusiasm for new risk exploration 
investment.

According to its estimates, if all the gas discoveries were 
appraised, the petroleum sector had the ability to reduce the trade 
deficit by 10-20 % over a period of 3-5 years.

<a name="15hi">15% hike in furnace oil prices soon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 11: The government has decided to increase prices 
of furnace oil by 15 per cent in keeping with one of the IMF 
conditionalities agreed under the structural reforms programme.

Official sources told Dawn on Saturday that the petroleum ministry 
was likely to issue a notification to this effect within 48 hours. 
They said the increase in the prices of POL products would also be 
announced very shortly.

"Since the government has linked the domestic prices of oil with 
international market, we have no option but to increase the prices 
of furnace oil and POL products whenever the world oil prices 
increased", said a source in the petroleum ministry.

He said the furnace oil prices had increased from $50 to $90 per 
ton in the international market forcing the government to enhance 
the prices of the commodity.

Sources said that the government had planned to increase the prices 
of furnace oil and POL products in the second quarter of 1999--
2000, starting from October. However, the dramatic increases in the 
world oil prices in recent weeks and also the need to improve the 
depressing revenue collection position forced the government to 
increase the prices a month earlier.

<a name="tbil">T-bills yield may be raised to stabilize rupee</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Sept 17: The State Bank of Pakistan may increase the yield 
on treasury bills to check such distortions in inter-bank foreign 
exchange market that may keep the rupee under pressure.

Senior bankers say the yield on the treasury bills has seen a 
progressive increase in the past few auctions and open market 
operations and it seems that the trend may continue.

"The State Bank would likely increase the yield by 1-2 percentage 
points in the coming months to check some distortions in inter-bank 
market and stabilize the rupee," said treasurer of a nationalized 
bank.

At its recent open market operation, the State Bank sucked in Rs 5 
billion from inter-bank market through three-month repo of treasury 
bills on a maximum yield of 8.95 per cent.

On Sept 8, SBP had auctioned on behalf of the government Rs 17.8 
billion worth of treasury bills-Rs 12 billion of six-month T-bills 
at 10.28 per cent and Rs 5.8 billion of one-year T-bills at 10.69 
per cent.

Senior bankers say these rates are higher by around 1-2 percentage 
points when compared to the rates prevailing a few months ago.

"This trend is likely to continue," said treasury manager of a 
local bank. He said the progressive increase in the yield on TBs 
indicates that the SBP is fully aware of how some corporates and 
banks are creating distortions in the system.

"The falling yield on TBs in the past few months resulted in cuts 
in lending rates to the corporates that started reinvesting the 
borrowed money instead of employing them in industrial activity," 
he explained.

Senior bankers say many of their corporate clients got cheaper 
loans and reinvested them in national saving schemes which still 
offer up to 14 per cent annual return.

"Indications are that the SBP would squeeze the market liquidity at 
higher yields on T- bills which in return make corporate credit 
dearer and corporates would not find it easier to reinvest the 
borrowed money in saving schemes," treasurer of a state-run bank 
said.

He said faster and larger lifting of liquidity from the money 
market coupled with slower and thinner reinvestment of borrowed 
funds in government schemes should keep the rupee stable in the 
months to come.

Many bankers say if the government makes further cuts in the return 
on national saving schemes the achievement of the desired goal 
would be easier.

The rupee has been under pressure both at inter-bank as well as 
free foreign exchange market since the start of this month on 
rising demand for the US dollars.

The dollar is trading around Rs 51.80 in the inter-bank market and 
past Rs 54.30 in the open market: the spread between the two has 
risen to Rs 2.40 per dollar.

Senior bankers say the demand for the greenback has gone up in the 
inter-bank market on capital outflows from the stock market; debt 
servicing and rising imports.

They say that the demand for foreign exchange is so high and supply 
so low that the rupee may slide steeply if SBP lifts what they call 
an unofficial cap on exchange rate.

Money changers say the US dollar has been up with the start of Haj 
season as those intending to perform Haj under sponsorship scheme 
buy foreign exchange from the open market. They say that some of 
stock market investors-particularly the foreign ones are also 
diverting themselves to the free foreign exchange market as bourses 
are currently under slump.

"The rupee has been under pressure in the inter-bank market as 
there has been an increased demand for the dollar for some time," 
said treasury manager of a foreign bank. "Though the market seems 
to be calm and cool the undercurrents indicate that banks may not 
be able to keep the dollar below Rs 52.0 by the end of the year."

<a name="kse1">KSE 100-share index down by 8.5 points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 17: Stocks failed to extend the overnight rally on 
Friday as weekend selling in the pivotals pushed the KSE 100-share 

index down by more than eight points.

The market showed either-way erratic movement amid conflicting 
rumours about a possible accord with the management of Hubco and 
the release of fourth tranche of $280 million by the IMF. The index 
was early up by eight points and managed to hold the initial gains 
until the late weekend selling in Hub-Power and PTCL again pushed 
it down.

Larger decline was,however, averted as selling was mainly confined 
to current favourites, notably Hub-Power and PTCL and some other 
blue chips.

'About 80% of the business remains confined to these two shares as 
investors are not inclined to move out of the safe havens for 
obvious reasons including the political uncertainty', said a KSE 
member.

He said the market might not fall from the current levels, there is 
also a remote possibility of a big turnaround either owing to 
prevailing political situation.

It was perhaps in this background that the market is essentially 
thriving on rumours brought in regularly by some vested interest to 
suit their financial interest, he added.

The KSE 100-share index fell 8.54 points at 1,155.63 as compared to 
1,164.17 points, erasing the overnight gain as leading shares base 
shares failed to hold on to their previous gains. It was up by the 
same amount in the morning on Hub-co settlement rumours.

Analysts said market talk of an imminent settlement of the tariff 
issue with Hubco and other foreign Independent Power Producers 
(IPPs), continued to inspire renewed buying in the energy sector, 
although there is no official confirmation on the subject.

'It appears to be a back-channel diplomacy apparently leading to 
secret talks between WAPDA and the Hubco management', they added.

But some others said the rumours about the accord are speculative 
and are floated by some vested interests to push the share value of 
Hub-Power higher and then to liquidate positions.

'The credence to rumours of an imminent agreement with Hubco on the 
tariff issue was apparently given the finance minister's statement 
that agreement will signed soon', said a leading broker.

Minus signs dominated the list under the lead of Islamic Bank, 
Shell Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser and Quetta Textiles, falling by 
Rs2.50 to Rs4.50. Other prominent losers were led by PSO, Al-Ghazi 
Tractors, Balochistan Wheels and Reckitt and Colman, which ended 
lower by one rupee to Rs2.00.

Barring Nestle Milkpak, Gadoon Textiles 16th ICP and Balochistan 
Glass, which posted gains ranging from one rupee to Rs8.00, all 
other gains were fractional.

<a name="eart">Karachi : earthquake scene - 3</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

IN my first column of this series (Aug 29) those living in 
dangerous highrises, which is to say, all highrises standing in 
Karachi, were informed that anyone requesting assistance and 
information from SHEHRI would be given a full report on the 
construction and state of his/her building. We were expecting a 
spate of requests from anxious citizens. Number so far received : 
zero. Are we to feel relieved that no one cares, or horrified?

More from Turkey: 27,000 buildings collapsed and the authorities 
expect this figure to reach 35,000 when their on-going survey is 
completed, 54,294 building were heavily damaged, 38,362 buildings 
were less damaged, and the government now feels that as many as 
280,000 housing units will have to be built to accommodate the 
600,000 rendered homeless, of which 253,000 are still shelterless 
and waiting for tents to be supplied to them. Independent analysts 
estimate that the toll of the quake on the Turkish economy will be 
around $ 25 billion. This is apart from the human loss which 
carries no price. The reason for the alarming amount is mainly due 
to the fact that the larger number of buildings that collapsed were 
not built according to the required standards.

To Greece: Last week an earthquake struck the Athens region, but 
luckily of a low intensity. Buildings and structures built well 
over 2,000 years ago still stand, unshaken, uncracked. Buildings 
built over the past few years fell, or were cracked. The death 
count is less than a hundred, an equal number is missing and some 
2,000 were injured.

How many in Pakistan now remember, or bother to remember, what 
happened in Quetta in 1935? 60,000 people of a population of less 
than 90,000 living in the earthquake area lost their lives in the 
great earthquake of that year.

Fortunately for us all, there is a handful of concerned citizens 
who worry about the welfare of the people, who fight on, hoping to 
be able to impress upon someone someday that building standards 
must be adhered to for reasons of safety and of the environment. 
One of the handful is young Qazi Faez Isa, an active member of 
SHEHRI, a barrister of Karachi, whose family has lived in Quetta 
for several generations. Reproduced are excerpts from his column 
printed in this newspaper on June 10 1988:"Presently buildings in 
Quetta are coming up at a frightening rate and speed with scant 
regard to the earthquake factor. There seems to be no supervision 
or planning. In an earthquake area it is essential that there be 
open spaces and parks in congested areas of the city where citizens 
may collect when buildings start coming down on them. Quetta city 
has the unique distinction of having a solitary park, the Liaquat 
Park, which is away from the congested city area.

"A golden opportunity presented itself to the authorities to have a 
park in the heart of the city when a decision was taken to move to 
another location the well-laid-out vegetable and fruit market 
situated in Kandahari Bazaar. Meetings held by citizens of Quetta 
demanded that when the market was pulled down a park be set up in 
its stead. But the municipality and the authorities recommended a 
multi-storeyed shopping complex. This betrayal of trust was 
undoubtedly motivated by the money which is to be made on the 
allotment and sale of shops.

"After the earthquake, all of Quetta city was rebuilt in accordance 
with regulations set out by Harry Oddin-Taylor (O.T.), one of the 
builders of the Sukkur Barrage. O.T. set out specific regulations 
and prescribed even the quantity of cement to be used. The 
construction of every building was watched and monitored at every 
stage. A checking system was introduced involving coloured cards 
which builders had to produce at each of the seven stages of 
building. Those who did not comply with the regulations had their 
buildings pulled down.

"It was a testament to the integrity of those men that when another 
earthquake of similar intensity to that of the one of 1935 hit 
Quetta six years later,no building came down."

'Those men' left in 1947 and we blame them for leaving us as 
'jungley' as we are !

"To arrest the irregular and illegal building growth in Quetta, 
Begum Saida Qazi Isa, Qazi Azmat Isa and Qazi Faez Isa filed a 
petition (No.125/95) in the High Court of Balochistan against the 
Quetta Municipal Corporation, Quetta Development Authority, 
Government of Balochistan, and Others. The Bench headed by Justice 
Amirul Mulk Mengal and Justice Javed Iqbal. Justice Mengal wrote a 
judgment [ PLD 1997 Quetta 1] which will stand the test of time. It 
was significant in that it applies to each and every building 
coming up in Quetta, as well as those planned in the future. By 
this one judgment, the High Court came to the assistance of and 
gave relief to each and every inhabitant of the city, thwarted the 
machinations of all illegal builders and put a stop to the abetment 
and connivance by officials who were responsible for the 
implementation of the building laws but who were failing in their 
responsibility." (Faez Isa, Dawn, August 22 1996)

*From Justice Mengal's judgment:"An aggrieved person within the 
meaning of Article 199 of the Constitution would not necessarily 
mean a person having a strict legal right. Even a person who was 
deprived of benefit, privilege, etc, by an illegal act or omission 
could be considered as an aggrieved person . . ."

"We appreciate that petitioners have come before the court to 
invoke constitutional jurisdiction of this court as regards the 
dangerous situation which has arisen due to construction of multi-
storeyed buildings in Quetta town without observing provisions of 
building code, thus putting into peril the lives of inhabitants and 
passers-by. The entire population of Quetta cannot be allowed to be 
put in danger for the benefit of a few builders who are 
constructing plazas and multi-storeyed buildings as against the 
provisions of Building Code 1937 . . . . . . . ."

"The population of Quetta, if construction of such [irregular] 
buildings are allowed, shall be put to the threshold of horrible 
destruction in case, God forbid, any earthquake of high grade jolts 
the town, In such circumstances we are entitled to hold that the 
petitioners have rightly approached this court."

In conclusion, the High Court was pleased to "direct the Chief 
Secretary, Government of Balochistan, to issue directions to 
Administrator, Quetta Municipal Corporation, to find out the number 
of under-construction multi-storeyed buildings in Quetta town and 
to issue notices to owners/ builders and after [an] opportunity of 
hearing them, order such amendment/alteration in the building 
plans, commensurate with the Building Code, particularly as far as 
height of building is concerned. No concession shall be given to 
the builders."

The builders filed an appeal against this judgment in the Supreme 
Court which was dismissed. The judgment has been endorsed by the 
Supreme Court and it has attained finality. It now requires 
implementation by the Government and its functionaries.

Quetta has acted. This week we read in "Dawn" on September 10 : 
"The Quetta Municipal Corporation (QMC) has imposed a ban on 
highrise buildings in the city to implement the code of the 
building control department controlling town planning.

"This was decided at a meeting of the QMC building control 
department presided over by Mayor Rahim Kakar . . . . .

"All the maps and site plans approved in violation of the code 
would be cancelled with immediate effect, an official announcement 
said."

Justice Mengal later became the Chief Justice of the Balochistan 
High Court. The people of Balochistan felt safe and secure with him 
as their CJ; the government did not. Earlier this year, the 
government got rid of him from Balochistan and neutralized him by 
elevating him to the Supreme Court. Rather than be shunted out to a 
Bench where he would be relatively helpless, the good judge chose 
to resign.Though the people of Quetta were unable to save the open 
space made available when their vegetable market was shifted, the 
people of Karachi hope to save the Sabzi Mandi space and the few 
other open spaces that remain to them. SHEHRI and concerned 
citizens will have to go to court to protect themselves against the 
numerous land grabbers, including those grabbing for the prime 
minister's disastrous 'Mera Ghar' scheme. Money is needed for this. 
Who is willing to help?

Ayaz Amir

THE sad truth is that a popular movement or agitation has never 
brought down a Pakistani government before. It is not going to do 
so in this season. If the only threat to the empire of the heavy 
mandate was from the 19-party alliance, now expansively dubbed the 
Grand Democratic Alliance, Mian Nawaz Sharif would have little to 
fear. His real concern is different and arises from another 
quarter: his relationship with Rawalpindi which, not to put too 
fine a point on it, is fraught and tense because of the great 
Kargil fiasco.

The public owning of responsibility is a tradition which has never 
existed in Pakistan. If there was no night of the long knives after 
Pakistan was dismembered in 1971, it is too much to expect that 
there would be an outburst of honesty or blood-letting because of 
Kargil in 1999. The Islamic Republic in crisis has always seen the 
ruling elites closing ranks and protecting their own so as to pull 
a blanket of discretion over even their greatest follies.

There is a telling and crucial difference this time. Kargil has 
dealt a blow to the unity of the governing class, driving a wedge 
between the heavy mandate and Rawalpindi. While both have had their 
fingers burnt, both are trying to put the blame for this fiasco on 
the shoulders of the other. In the shades of Islamabad this is the 
real cat-and-mouse game being played. Compared to this game the 
opposition agitation in the rest of the country, for all its sound 
and fury, is a side-show.

To be sure this agitation is not without significance, for the more 
it picks up steam the more rattled and disoriented becomes the 
heavy mandate. But it is not of decisive importance. The key to 
political change has never been in the hands of the people.

The great objection being levelled at the opposition alliance is 
that it does not have a common programme or a single candidate for 
prime minister. This objection is pointless. Even if the present 
opposition had Karl Marx to write its manifesto, and Akbar the 
Great as its prime minister-in-waiting, it would still make no 
difference. Change in Islamabad, even when undertaken in pursuance 
of a constitutional clause such as the now-defunct Article 58(2)b, 
has always occurred after a nod or signal of active support from 
Rawalpindi. Any political hopeful forgetting this elementary 
principle of Pakistani politics is not likely to carry his 
ambitions very far.

Mian Nawaz Sharif should know the truth of this since the 
inexorable rise to glory and power of Ittefaq Inc. is a direct 
outcome of military benevolence. Without generous help from that 
quarter, Nawaz Sharif would have been another industrialist living 
the good life in Lahore.

Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan also knows this eternal verity of 
Pakistani politics. Although he has spent his life putting together 
political alliances, some of them quite amazing, against autocratic 
regimes (except for that one time when he found himself supping at 
General Zia-ul-Haq's lurid table), who should know better than him 
that as often as not democratic movements have served as the 
enabling instruments of dictatorial ambition? Thus it was in 1968-
69 when the movement against 

Field Marshal Ayub Khan culminated in the coup d'etat of General 
Yahya Khan. Thus again in 1977 when General Zia-ul-Haq stole the 
fruits of the agitation against Zulfikhar Ali Bhutto. There are of 
course fearless knights in Pakistan, and not a few of them in the 
English press, who angrily declare that never again will they 
tolerate another adventurer. If only wishes were horses and 
adventurers could be stopped from riding into power by searing 
columns in the English language press.

On stud farms, as aficionados of equine matters are well aware, 
mares are put in the right frame of mind by horses called 'testing 
ponies'. Only when things reach the desired pitch does the stallion 
who is supposed to do the final honours brought on the scene. The 
pity of democratic politics in Pakistan is that opposition 
alliances, in all sincerity and with the best intentions in the 

world, have played the role of testing ponies to Bonapartist 
stallions. When things get hot, someone else appears on the scene 
to carry the prize away. This is not to disparage democratic 
politics but merely to point out one of the structural defects of 
our Republic. What's more, till such time that the Republic's 
stables are thoroughly cleaned (by what Herculean process we do not 
know) this structural defect will remain. Indeed, if George Orwell 
were to rise from the dead and write a book on Pakistan he would 
have to call it Stud Farm not Animal Farm.

But if the opposition has problems, Nawaz Sharif has problems of 
his own which are of a much more serious nature. How will the 
stallions behave? That's his problem and not what pranks the 
testing ponies of the opposition are getting up to. Why then curse 
or belittle the opposition parties as Mian Nawaz Sharif and his 
loudspeakers are increasingly doing? And what point in working the 
crowds in Santnagar, Mian Azhar's home base in Lahore? If Mian 
Azhar was the only threat which Nawaz Sharif faced, he could play 
cricket to his heart's content and resume his foreign travels, now 
sadly interrupted because of his domestic preoccupations. From all 
of which the conclusion can be drawn that instead of tilting at 
windmills, the rattled barons of the heavy mandate should be seeing 
the larger picture and trying to put their own house in order.

But this precisely is the problem. It is difficult changing course 
in mid-stream. If a particular style of government is confused and 
bumbling, there is no instant formula which can turn it overnight 
into a model of vigour and clarity. What Dostoyevsky said about the 
second half of a man's life - that it is mostly a repetition of the 
first half - is also true of statecraft. If you do not have this 
gift in you, acquiring it is difficult. That is why it will take 
more than magic to make the second half of the heavy mandate look 
any different from what we have seen of it in the first half. So 
Nawaz Sharif's problem is not that he should become a more 
efficient and effective ruler. That is not going to happen. His 
problem is stark in its simplicity: how to disperse the testing 
ponies and keep the stallions tethered firmly in their proper 
place.

Therein lies the rub. In the giant stables in Rawalpindi where 
Pakistan's champion stallions are kept, the mood is dark; some 
would go so far as to say even dangerous. One indication of this is 
the almost permanent scowl that has come to sit on the army chief's 
face. A carefree man before Kargil, he now looks visibly unhappy. 
Niaz Naik has only made matters worse. Whatever he may have meant 
to convey, his remarks in Karachi will be taken by the army high 
command as another attempt at putting the entire blame for Kargil 
on its shoulders while absolving the civilian leadership of all 
responsibility.

Naik has said that because of poor coordination among those 
planning the Kargil venture, the prime minister was not fully in 
the know of it, the implication being that had he known what was 
going on he would have put a stop to it - which is to put more 
faith in the prime minister's powers of observation than even his 
partisans might be willing to allow. Naik has gone on to say that 
back-channel contacts between India and Pakistan (of which Naik was 
a part from the Pakistani side) were leading to some sort of an 
agreement on Kashmir but that the possibility of any progress was 
spiked by the fighting in Kargil.

This is a travesty of the facts. Whatever secret contacts there 
were between India and Pakistan were post and not pre-Kargil and 
for Naik to imply anything different is irresponsible, especially 
at a time when there is tension and growing distrust between 
Rawalpindi and the heavy mandate.

In private, senior army officers are not above conceding that the 
army high command was guilty of serious errors of judgment about 
the Kargil expedition. What they resent are attempts to put the 
entire blame for this fiasco on the army command while giving a 
clean chit to the prime minister. This too is a travesty of the 
facts. The PM was in the know from the beginning.

I have been accused by friends of writing about Kargil endlessly. I 
write about it not because I am fond of the subject but because 
Kargil is stuck in the throats of the civilian and military 
leaderships and unless they can get it out from there it will keep 
causing problems all around. In any other half-mature country the 
government would have taken the lead and owned up to the blunder 
committed, asked for some sort of public forgiveness and then tried 
to get on with life. But this would have required a breadth of 
vision and a largeness of heart that on the political stage are 
nowhere to be seen.

This is precisely why the disease instead of being cured continues 
to linger. Since it lingers the big question remains: will the 
sullen mood that can be felt in Rawalpindi pass or will it gel into 
something harder? To know the answer to this question is to 
understand how Pakistani politics will unfold in the critical 
months that lie ahead.

Irfan Husain

NOT very long ago, Pakistanis were proud of their hospitality to 
strangers. No longer. Now, foreigners are killed by terrorists and 
threatened by politicians; as a result, Pakistan is on the list of 
no-go areas of overseas travel agents and governments alike.

Over the last two decades, Pakistan has become more and more 
insular and inward looking as politicians have sought scapegoats 
abroad to cover up their own inadequacies. Religious leaders have 
simultaneously endeavoured to convince their respective followers 
that their woes are the direct result of the anti-Pakistan plots 
woven by their Western, Zionist and Indian foes. These converging 
attitudes have fed a growing xenophobia as a substantial majority 
of Pakistanis is now convinced that the rest of the world is 
against us.

In this 'Them versus Us' environment, few people are any longer 
appalled when leading religious leaders like Maulana Fazlur Rahman 

openly threaten foreigners for the acts of their governments. A 
number of Iranians and Americans have been killed by terrorists on 
our soil with a minimal official response. The whole issue of the 
government's mishandling of the independent power producers (IPPs) 
is a case in point. Here are major overseas investors who have come 
in with significant amounts to build or buy power plants under 
legally binding agreements with the previous government.

Now, in the name of so-called accountability, they are being 
harassed and their contracts are being flouted. Why anybody would 
invest in such a climate is a question only Senator Saifur Rehman, 
head of the Accountability Cell, can answer. The impression is 
gaining currency that these IPPs are being targeted because the 
kickbacks they are alleged to have given only went to members of 
the previous government, and the present lot was ignored.

As the global village shrinks and the world economy becomes more 
tightly integrated, people everywhere are lowering national 
frontiers to the free flow of foreign products and ideas. Once 
trade barriers are effectively abolished in 2005 under the World 
Trade Organisation agreements we are signatory to, we will be 
flooded with goods from all over the world that are not only 
cheaper, but better made than domestic products. As (more) 
Pakistani businesses go to the wall and unemployment increases, we 
can expect industrialists and labour unions to join the anti-
foreigner chorus.

But the world will not sit still and wait for us to shed our 
hangovers and phobias. While we fall further and further behind, 
together with countries like Afghanistan, Somalia and Serbia, the 
rest of the world will move ahead and develop and grow. Inevitably, 
there will be pockets of poverty in this brave new world, but they 
will strive to catch up. We, on the other hand, will have convinced 
ourselves that as the rest of the world is against us, it is 
pointless making the effort to progress.

However, Pakistan's self-imposed isolation is not unique: in much 
of the Muslim world, a similar retreat from reality can be 
witnessed. Specifically, the fundamentalist agenda calls for 
turning our backs on modern education, based as it is on reason and 
rationality, and harking back to the norms and values that 
prevailed centuries ago in Arabia. For the religious right, this is 
the panacea for all our ills. But this kind of wishful thinking 
flies in the face of the logic that underpins the modern, Western 
culture that now holds sway in much of the world. Even ideological 
states like China now order their economies along the lines of the 
Western, capitalist model, and their policies are pragmatic and 
rational instead of being rigid and socialist.

As the Muslim world falls further and further behind, powerful 
fundamentalist elements see this failure as the direct outcome of 
the secular model adopted by many of the ruling elites. 
Furthermore, since Western nations have based their governments on 
liberal democracy, these values are all viewed with suspicion and 
hostility by religious parties and groups, as are any ideas and 
ideals that are in any way "Western". Politicians in much of the 
Muslim world now try and avoid being smeared with the secular, 
liberal brush. Thus, the space available to these ideas is 
constantly shrinking to be replaced with retrogressive models. In 
Pakistan, at least, the fundamentalists won the debate by default 
years ago.

In this prevailing environment of sullen defeatism, it becomes easy 
to transfer blame for our backwardness to foreigners. If we lose 
the cricket World Cup, either the umpires were against us or our 
players sold out to Indian bookies. We cannot accept that somebody 
else played better than our team. If we were forced to pull out of 
Kargil, we do not ask why our soldiers were placed in such an 
untenable position, but we do blame Clinton for pressuring Nawaz 
Sharif. And so on.

But at the end of the day, we are the only losers: by not accepting 
reality, we cannot progress. Once we convince ourselves that 
somebody else is to blame for our troubles, we have no incentive to 
change things. By forever wallowing in self-pity and dreaming of a 
long-distant past, we ensure that we will never pull ourselves out 
of the pit we have dug. And by transferring the fault for our own 
backwardness to foreigners, we increase the distance between us and 
the global mainstream.

Another reason for our self-imposed isolation is that even 
sophisticated, well-travelled Pakistanis are often unaware of how 
the rest of the world really functions. For instance, during the 
recent Kosovo crisis, Turkey lost hundreds of thousands of tourists 
this summer because to many foreigners, the bombing was taking 
place in the same region, never mind that the two countries are far 
apart. Given the anti-Western rhetoric our politicians are prone 
to, as well as the well-publicized attacks on foreigners, how does 
Information Minister Mushahid Hussain think he will lure tourists 
to Pakistan in his much-touted 'Visit Pakistan' year in 2001?

These attitudes transfer to foreign policy as well: countries seen 
in the rest of the world as 'rogue states' will get no sympathy or 
support for their economy or their territorial claims. So whatever 
the validity of our legal claim to Kashmir, no amount of government 
propaganda or junkets by official delegates is going to cut any ice 
with foreigners as long as we are perceived as the bad guys. And we 
will continue being seen in this light as long as we remain out of 
step with the rest of the world.

<a name="akra">Akram reinstated as captain for Toronto series</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick

LONDON, Sept 13: Wasim Akram was reinstated as Pakistan cricket 
captain for the three-match one-day international series against 
the West Indies starting at Toronto from Thursday, chairman of the 
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) ad hoc committee Mujeeb-ur-Rehman 
announced at a press conference here on Monday.

Wasim Akram, who was suspended by the board alongwith Salim Malik 
and Ijaz Ahmad, pending completion of inquiry by High Court Judge 
Justice Qayyum on match-fixing charges, was present at the news 
conference held at Pakistan High Commission this morning.

Though Justice Qayyum has yet to submit his inquiry report to 
President Rafiq Tarar, the PCB chairman claimed that no charge has 
been established against these players during the internal inquiry 
conducted by the board.

"Our lawyers who contacted Justice Qayyum have been informed by the 
judge that there is no ban on Wasim Akram to play so we are 
appointing him as captain of the Pakistani team," Mujeeb-ur-Rehman 
told reporters.

The PCB had earlier appointed wicket-keeper Moin Khan to lead the 
Pakistani team at Toronto.

The Pakistan cricket team will be arriving in London on Monday 
afternoon and will leave for Toronto on Tuesday.

Wasim Akram, who is working for a county club in Birmingham to 
"hunt Asian talent", will be joining the Pakistani team from 
London, as will be Pakistani spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, who is 
playing for Surrey.

Mujeeb said the inquiries conducted by the PCB as well as by 
Ehtesab Bureau Chief Saif-ur-Rehman, who is his elder brother, have 
failed to establish any wrong-doing by these players.

The PCB chairman said that the judicial inquiry report has been 
sent to President Rafiq Tarar and will be made public within two or 
three days.

He, however, could not satisfy reporters as to how Wasim Akram has 
been nominated as captain when the inquiry report has yet to be 
submitted to the President or what would happen if the report bars 
Wasim Akram from playing.

Asked whether Wasim and other players have been absolved by the 
judge, he said he had no knowledge.
"However, PCB lawyers have been told that there is no ban on the 
playing of these cricketers."

He said Salim Malik and Ijaz Ahmad have not been selected by the 
PCB selection committee because of their performance. He said the 
team selection for Toronto series has been made on merit and on the 
basis of the players' performance.

He said the names of Ijaz Ahmad and Salim Malik were also on the 
list, from which the team was finally selected.

Mujeeb said that PCB has asked all the players to declare their 
assets to avoid allegations of match-fixings in future.

Referring to differences between Wasim Akram and Aamir Sohail, the 
PCB chairman said that Aaamir Sohail has been included in the team 
and hoped that the differences between the two players would soon 
be settled.

The PCB chairman agreed that an international syndicate is involved 
in "match-fixings" but asserted that it was too difficult to get a 
match fixed.
