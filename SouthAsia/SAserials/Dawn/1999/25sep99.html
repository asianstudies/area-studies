<a name="coas">COAS denies differences with govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Sept 23: Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf on 
Thursday dismissed reports of differences with the government as 
disinformation.

"There is no misunderstanding between the government and the army," 
Gen Musharraf told reporters at a reception marking the national 
day of Saudi Arabia.

He refuted reports that he was planning to quit amid an alleged 
rift with the government over the handling of the recent Kashmir 
conflict with India.

"I am going to complete my tenure," he said. Mr Musharraf was 
speaking after chairing a meeting of top military commanders.

It followed an unusual warning by the United States on Monday 
against any "unconstitutional move" to remove the government of 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

The US statement was issued after talks between Sharif's brother 
Shahbaz Sharif and US officials in Washington last week. 

"I don't think there is mention of the army" in the US statement, 
the COAS said.

Musharraf refused to comment on the current opposition campaign to 
oust Sharif's government over its domestic and foreign policies.

"I am not a political or constitutional expert," he said.

"I am a soldier and I don't want to comment on the government-
opposition relations."-AFP

Our bureau adds: On the recent statement of Niaz A. Naik, the COAS 
said: "Mr Naik unnecessarily created a controversy."

Brushing aside an impression that the government had not been taken 
into confidence over the Kargil operation, he said it was the 
government's decision and added that army was part of the 
government.

He denied that the Kargil operation had scuttled the back- channel 
diplomacy or come in the way of an agreement on Kashmir. Rather, he 
said, it was the Kargil issue which had prompted the back-channel 
diplomacy.

When asked to comment on the propaganda being waged by the Indians 
at the international level against the Pakistan Army, he said, in 
fact, Indian army was a rogue army. Look what they have been doing 
in Kashmir, he added.

On the efforts being made by the government to counter the Indian 
propaganda, he said "a lot more could be done."

<a name="paki">Pakistan to resume Nuclear test if India does</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Sept 20: Pakistan has been quietly told by the US in 
back-channel diplomacy to sign the CTBT conditionally, with a 
provision to restart nuclear testing if India does so, 
knowledgeable sources revealed on Monday.

They said Pakistan had shown willingness to accept the US demand 
provided Washington made some move which could be used by Islamabad 
as a face-saving device to move forward since Pakistan had 
explicitly and publicly laid down its conditions for putting its 
signature on the treaty.

This back-channel diplomacy on CTBT, mainly conducted by the Punjab 
Chief Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, comes shortly after a similar 
effort on Kargil, spearheaded by former foreign secretary Niaz 
Naik, ended in complete disaster, with everybody getting burnt in 
the process.

Shahbaz Sharif is trying to reach some agreement on how to appease 
the Clinton administration so that Washington does not put 
obstacles to the release of the vital $280 million tranche by the 
IMF in the next few days, something which could spell disaster for 
the Nawaz Sharif government and Pakistan as a whole.

The sources said pressure was being put on Pakistan to sign the 
CTBT conditionally because the Clinton administration was stuck in 
Congress and almost unable to meet the conditions for signing the 
treaty laid down by Islamabad.

These conditions include ending the atmosphere of coercion, removal 
of sanctions, restoration of assistance and some recognition of 
what the Indian nuclear and missile programme, as enunciated by 
their doctrine, had in store for the region and what the Americans 
proposed to do about it.

It is generally believed here that unless President Clinton 
achieves some significant progress on CTBT in South Asia, his 
expected visit may not take place and that would deprive Mr Clinton 
of something he very seriously desires -- a nuclear restraint 
agreement in South Asia and a visit to that region before he bows 
out to the new US president in January 2001.

A senior Pakistan embassy official on Friday tried to dilute the 
importance of Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz's statements on the CTBT 
by putting the blame on the media and saying that it had not been 
properly reported.

"Basically about the position which emerged from the FM's 
statement, I don't know how far it was accurately reported, but he 
has said so, and I know that the position is that we would want to 
sign the CTBT, we would like to stick to and honour the commitment 
which was made on the General Assembly floor last year except that 
the ground situation has to be so prepared to enable us to go ahead 
and sign the CTBT," the embassy official said.

The situation in Congress is that the Brownback Amendment, which 
was adopted by the Senate, has got stuck in the House of 
Representatives where the Indian lobby is so strong that they would 
not let any legislation move ahead which even remotely helped 
Pakistan.

The committee, headed by Benjamin Gilman, is now considering a move 
by Mr Gilman himself which, if adopted, would allow transfer of 
dual-use technology to India while keeping all the restrictions on 
transfer of military equipment on Pakistan under the Pressler and 
Glenn Amendments.

The administration was trying to get the Brownback Amendment passed 
so that the president gets the authority and flexibility to 
manoeuvre by resorting to some give and take, but it appears that 
the waiver authority would not be extended for five years.

<a name="uswa">US waives sanctions on environment</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Sept 22: President Clinton on Tuesday waived sanctions 
against Pakistan and India until Oct 20. But the waiver applies 
only to assistance to the Asian Elephant Conservation Fund, the 
Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Fund, and the Indo-American 
Environmental Leadership Programme.

A White House text of the presidential determination No99-38 said: 
Pursuant to the authority vested in me as President of the US, and 
consistent with section 902 of the India-Pakistan Relief Act of 
1998 (Public Law 105-277), to the extent provided in that section, 
I hereby waive until Oct 20, 1999 

the sanctions and prohibitions contained in sections 101 and 102 of 
the Arms Export Control Act insofar as such sanctions and 
prohibitions would otherwise apply to assistance to the Asian 
Elephant Conservation Fund, the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation 
Fund, and the Indo-American Environmental Leadership Programme.

<a name="gdar">GDA rally today: Tension mounts as police raid leaders' houses </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamimur Rehman

KARACHI, Sept 24: Tension mounted in the city on Friday as the 
police arrested over 900 activists of the GDA's component parties 
to prevent the opposition from staging a rally at Schon Chowrangi 
on Saturday.

According to the opposition sources, more than 700 activists of the 
PPP and over 100 of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had so far been 
picked up.

The government on Friday night declared that it would not allow the 
opposition to hold the rally as there was Section 144 Cr.PC in the 
city which banned such public gatherings. Police commandos had 
taken up positions at vantage points while patrolling had been 
intensified. The opposition vowed to defy the ban come what may.

Late in the night, dozens of the police mobiles cordoned off the 
area around the MQM head office at Azizabad and Bilawal House, the 
residence of opposition leader and PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto.

All streets around the MQM office were surrounded by the police and 
the party claimed that the police had threatened the people not to 
participate in the rally.

Similarly, the police surrounded the Bilawal House and nobody was 
allowed to leave or enter the building.

PPP sources said the police had raided the residence of Sindh PPP 
chief Nisar Khuhro but women members of his family did not allow 
the police to enter the residence without showing arrest/search 
warrant.

Police also raided the residence of PPP MNA Prof N.D. Khan. The 
family said that around 50 policemen in 15 vans entered the Bon 
Vista apartment in Clifton, harassed the watchmen and raided their 
apartment. They searched each and every room and asked about the 
whereabouts of the MNA who was not home at the time.

The family said the police did not show any arrest warrant and 
entered forcibly in the house. They harassed the family and said it 
was their duty to obey the orders to arrest Prof Khan.

The house of PPP leader Qaim Ali Shah was also surrounded by the 
police in the small hours of Saturday.

Meanwhile, the provincial secretary-general of the Awami National 
Party, Farooq Bangash, was picked up by the police at Shah Faisal 
Colony, party sources said.

In two localities of District South - P&T Colony and Dehli Colony - 
scores of people were taken into custody and till late in the 
evening, a heavy posse of the police was seen picking up people.

A PPP spokesman said the police had arrested its over 700 activists 
and raids were continuing at different places. He alleged that 
shopkeepers in and around the designated area of the rally were 
being told by the police to keep their shutters committee for Sindh 
and Balochistan appealed to the international human rights 
organizations and democratic forces to take notice of the regime's 
fascist policies and abuse of state power.

It said the regime had created unemployment, usurped political and 
economic rights of smaller provinces by not releasing their due 
share in the NFC and water accord and by making the provincial 
legislature ineffective and indulging in persecution of the 
opposition. The Nawaz regime had no right to remain in power, the 
coordination committee said.

<a name="bena">Benazir says Nawaz to go by December</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Sept 24: Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto predicted 
here on Thursday that the Nawaz Sharif government would fall before 
December.

The PPP leader was talking to Pakistan correspondents at the office 
of lobbyist Mark Siegal. The office has been made her temporary 
headquarters with big PPP and Pakistan flags put up at its 
entrance.

She has been meeting top US officials and human rights 
organizations during the last five days and will stay in Washington 
until early next week. She is due to come back to Washington again 
next month.

Ms Bhutto, who talked to correspondents for more than an hour, 
appeared to be in her usual prime ministerial mode and talked at 
length about the achievements of her government vis-a-vis the 
failures of the Nawaz Sharif government.

Asked how long in her view the Nawaz Sharif government would last, 
she said: "Before December they will go."

To the question whether and when she saw herself back in power, the 
twice-ousted prime minister said: "I don't know that but I can say 
one thing for sure. If I am not given back power, no other leader 
in Pakistan can handle the country's affairs."

When told by a questioner that her claim that only she could handle 
the country's affairs would break up the 19-party alliance trying 
to throw Nawaz Sharif out, as each one of them saw himself as the 
next prime minister, she said: "They all can throw their hats into 
the ring when the next elections are held and whoever gets the 
mandate of the people will rule."

Ms Bhutto strongly refuted the impression that the statement issued 
by the state department warning against a military coup in Pakistan 
was in support of the Nawaz Sharif government. "I went over the 
statement with US officials and I find there is nothing which 
supports the Nawaz government," she said.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz flays opposition's policy of agitation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 24: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that the 
people have rejected the politics of agitation and confrontation 
which is not only disrupting the schedule of their daily lives but 
also badly affecting the efforts at socio-economic development.

According to a press release issued by the Prime Minister's House 
PID camp office the prime minister said this while talking to the 
parliamentarians at the PM House here on Friday. He said that the 
opposition must learn to abide by the rules in true spirit of 
democracy.

The opposition should, therefore, shun negative politics as those 
obstructing the development activity in fact strengthening the 
hands of those elements who want to keep us backward, he added.

The chief of Jamiat-i-Ahle Hadith, Senator Sajid Mir extended full 
support to the government on behalf of Jamiat and said that it 
would stand by the government through thick and thin. He also put 
forth certain suggestions to check price hike and combat terrorism.

The members of the National Assembly apprised the prime minister of 
the problems being faced by the people in their respective 
constituencies and pace of development work.

The prime minister assured them of a quick solution of the 
problems.

Those who met the prime minister included Senator Prof Sajid Mir, 
MNAs, Raja Muhammad Afzal, Maulana Moeen uddin Lakhvi, Mian Mahmood 
Ahmad Khan, Adnan Noon, Mian Muhammad Farooq and Mumtaz Ahmad 
Tarar. 

The chief whip of the PML parliamentary party, Sheikh Aftab Ahmed 
was also present on the occasion.

<a name="stat">Train Accident: Station master, 2 others held for Wah accident</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Syed Irfan Raza

RAWALPINDI, Sept 19: The death toll in the Chenab Express accident, 
which took place late onSaturday night at Wah, has risen to 20 
while over 100 passengers of the Karachi-bound train remain under 
treatment at different hospitals of Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Wah.

The accident took place when an engine parked at a separate track 
started rolling due to uneven surface and went to the track on 
which the Chenab Express was coming at a high speed. Twenty people 
were killed on-the-spot when the passenger train collided with the 
out-of-control engine. The deceased included nine women, eight 
children and three men. One aged woman, identified as Khan Bibi, 
succumbed to her injuries on Sunday.

The injured were rushed to the POF Hospital Wah, Tehsil 
Headquarters Hospital, Taxila, Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi, 
and District Headquarters Hospital, Rawalpindi.

The number of injured was stated to be over 100. Some of them were 
discharged after necessary medical aid.

The Karachi-bound Chenab Express, which had started its journey 
from Peshawar, met with a horrible accident near Wah at 10.42 pm.

The rescue operation was started after half-an-hour of the accident 
and the injured were admitted to the hospitals of Rawalpindi at 
about 1:30 a.m. Sunday.

Troops were called out to assist the local administration for the 
rescue operation which continued for almost five hours.

Railway traffic, which was suspended due to the accident, was 
restored on Sunday at about 2:30 pm after the removal of wreckage.

The two engines and two bogies were destroyed in the accident while 
some of the bogies of Chenab Express were derailed.

The station master (on duty), the driver of the engine and the 
fireman have been arrested for alleged negligence.

The chief minister Punjab, who is on an official visit to the US, 
contacted the Chief Secretary, Punjab, A.Z.K Sher Dil, on telephone 
and asked him to visit the site of the accident.

The inspector of Railways (federal) will hold formal inquiry into 
the cause of the accident at the site viz Taxila Cantonment Station 
on September 22 at 10 a.m. and the inquiry report will be submitted 
within 15 days to the government and will be made public.

The Federal Minister for Communication, Raja Nadir Pervez, on 
Sunday visited the site of the accident and ordered a high-level 
inquiry. In this connection, a committee has been formed which will 
present its report shortly.

Meanwhile, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has sought a detailed report 
on the train accident within 24 hours. He has also asked the 
Railway authorities to uncover the causes of the accident.

The prime minister in his condolence message expressed deep sorrow 
and grief over the loss of valuable lives in the accident of Chenab 
Express near Wah late Saturday night. In his separate messages 
addressed to the aggrieved families, he prayed that Allah Almighty 
may rest the souls of the deceased in peace and give courage to the 
families to bear this irreparable loss with courage and fortitude.

Our correspondent from Lahore adds: The Pakistan Railways has said 
that 20 passengers were killed and 45 injured in the accident 
between Budho and Taxila railway stations on Saturday night.

The Karachi-bound Chenab Express (12-Down) collided with a shunting 
locomotive as a result of which two coaches of the train (nos 1479 
and 1189) and its locomotive were damaged. The shunting locomotive 
was running from Taxila to Bhudo Railway Station when the Chenab 
Express collided with it.

According to the press release, a compensation of Rs.100,000 for 
the legal heirs of the deceased and Rs.50,000 for "seriously" 
injured passengers has been announced.

<a name="down">Downing of plane: Pakistan moves ICJ for damages</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Sept 21: Pakistan on Tuesday filed a case in the 
International Court of Justice (ICJ) to seek compensation from 
India for shooting down a navy plane last month, killing 16 persons 
on board, officials said.

Pakistan approached the ICJ arguing that "India is under an 
obligation to make reparations to Pakistan for the loss of the 
plane and compensation to the heirs of those killed", a foreign 
office statement said.

It accused India of violating the United Nations charter and 
provisions of international treaties by shooting down an unarmed 
naval surveillance plane.

The August 10 downing of the plane by Indian jets' air-to-air 
missiles killed all 16 officers and sailors on board.

"This act of blatant military aggression was unprovoked and in 
contravention of all universally accepted international legal 
norms," the statement said.

Officials said the plane was on a routine training flight inside 
Pakistani airspace when it was shot down.

The statement said Pakistan decided to seek legal recourse as India 
refused to accept a UN inquiry and also rejected the demand for 
damages.

In its case filed with the Hague-based ICJ, Pakistan said India was 
obliged to make reparations for the loss of the French-made 
Atlantic plane and compensation for the heirs of the 16 persons 
killed.

Pakistan appealed to the ICJ after India rejected its demand for 
more than $60m in compensation.

Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz had written last week to UN Secretary 
General Kofi Annan, requesting him to send a fact-finding mission 
to Pakistan to ascertain the truth.

Last month Pakistan had lodged an official complaint with the UN 
calling the incident an of aggression and demanded from India $60.2 
million in compensation for the loss of the plane and its 16 
personnel.-AFP/dpa/Reuters

<a name="rs10">Rs100 billion corruption in Pakistan each year: UN report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

DHAKA, Sept 19: A United Nation report released here on Sunday said 
corruption was costing south Asia billions of dollars a year.

The UN Development Programme report said corruption was costing 
Pakistan five per cent of its Gross National Product (GNP).

It added: "The magnitude of corruption in Pakistan alone exceeds Rs 
100 billion a year or five per cent of the total GNP."

The report said democracy in South Asia was being eroded and that 
corruption was on the increase.

The report said: "In Bangladesh, the implicit 'private taxes' - the 
costs of corruption - of setting up a business come to 340 per cent 
of the estimated initial official costs."

The UN Development Programme report characterised democracy in the 
region as "one step forward, two steps backward."

The report blamed South Asia's poverty largely on natural 
disasters, but also on efforts to expand nuclear capabilities and 
the global economic slow-down.

India and Pakistan carried out tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May 
last year, prompting international economic sanctions that were 
partially lifted in December.

The Human Development in South Asia report, prepared by the 
Islamabad-based Mahbub ul Huq Human Development Centre, was 
released at a news conference in Dhaka by David Lockwood, chief of 
the UN Development Programme in Bangladesh.

"Democracy is South Asia is not about people, it is about access to 
state power," the report said, adding that despite their democratic 
leanings, south Asian states had failed to provide their people 
with freedom from the worst forms of deprivation. Reuters

<a name="navy">Navy begins war-games</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Sept 21: The Pakistan Navy's annual wargames Hammerhead 99 
began here on Tuesday. The opening brief of the naval game was held 
at Pakistan Navy Tactical School. Admiral Fasih Bokhari, Chief of 
the Naval Staff, was the chief guest on the occasion.

Hammerhead 99 is the 21st of a series of conceptual exercises 
conducted annually by the navy as a prelude to the SEASPARK series 
of winter exercises. Though the exercise primarily revolves around 
the maritime scenario, all relevant aspects like the parallel land 
and battles are also taken into consideration.

Rear Admiral Fayyaz-ur-Rehman as the head of the control team 
highlighted the aims and principal objectives of the exercise. 

Later, the force commanders presented the concepts of various 
syndicates entrusted with the responsibilities to conduct their 
side of the operations.

The aim of this exercise is to evaluate the prevalent geo-strategic

<a name="supp">Support price of wheat increased</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 22: The cabinet on Wednesday increased support 
price of wheat from Rs240 for 40kg to Rs265 for the same weight to 
encourage wheat production in the country. It directed the 
authorities to ensure that there would be no increase in the prices 
of flour and roti.

The decision was taken at the second day of the cabinet meeting 
held here with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the chair. Owing to 
the decision, an additional expenditure of around Rs2.5 billion 
will be met by the government.

The cabinet decided to release Rs12.5 billion for Taamir-i-Watan 
Programme to help generate employment and improve the quality of 
life of the common man through farm-to-market roads and provision 
of gas and electricity on a large scale, even to the economically-
backward areas.

The meeting postponed a formal approval to the recommendations of 
the four-member ministerial committee headed by Finance Minister 
Ishaq Dar. The recommendations aimed at improving revenues, 
increasing exports, eliminating smuggling and restoring confidence 
of the foreign investors.

The committee was asked to further deliberate on the issues and put 
forward its recommendations at the next cabinet meeting.

Briefing reporters after the meeting, Information Minister Mushahid 
Hussain said the cabinet had approved the setting up of a special 
cabinet committee to rationalize the prices of medicines to make 
them affordable for the poor.

He said the prime minister had told the meeting that the government 
would not pass any burden to the common man, and whether it was the 
issue of atta or roti or the prices of essential medicines, the 
government would try to alleviate the difficulties of the poor 
sections of society.

The PM said that agriculture was the backbone of the economy and it 
was one of the objectives of the government to enhance wheat 
production which, in turn, would lead to self-sufficiency in wheat.

He said the government was sympathetic to the farmers' genuine 
needs for an increase in the support price of wheat and added that 
the decision would help the poor, promote productivity in 
agriculture and would also be an incentive to the farmers.

The information minister said that the cabinet had taken serious 
note of the discrepancy in the prices of essential medicines and of 
the fact that often spurious and expired drugs were being openly 
marketed.

He said it was decided to constitute a four-member committee on 
health which would be headed by Health Minister Makhdoom Javed 
Hashmi and consisted of Labour Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, 
minister of state for water and power, Haleem Siddiqui; and 
chairman of the Board of Investment, Humayun Akhtar.

The PM directed the health committee to lead a national 
consultation on the prices of medicines as well as the question of 
spurious and expired drugs with doctors, pharmacists, drug-
manufacturing companies, provincial governments, hospitals and 
concerned citizens. The committee would report back to the cabinet 
in three weeks. It would also invite suggestions from the people 
through media and through public hearings.

The prime minister said that issues of health were important among 
priorities of the government, and directed the committee to work 
out proposals aimed at free provision of life-saving drugs to poor 
patients suffering from serious ailments.

<a name="ipps">IPPs issue forces IMF to hold $280m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Sept 23: IMF Managing Director Michael Camdessus 
confirmed on Thursday that the disbursement of $280 million tranche 
to Pakistan had been "somewhat delayed".

Answering a question at his opening press conference at the 
IMF/World Bank annual meetings in Washington, he said Pakistan had 
not fulfilled some of the conditions it had pledged to do.

"There are difficulties with a few conditions. That is why the 
disbursement which was expected, has been somewhat delayed," the MD 
said.

His remarks came two days after World Bank President James 
Wolfensohn told his opening news conference that the IPPs issue was 
an obstacle to the IMF and World Bank lending to Pakistan and 
unless it was resolved the lending would not resume.

Mr Camdessus said the talks between the IMF and Pakistan would 
continue next week when we would see the Pakistan authorities 
during the annual meetings.

"We will see if they can clarify these things so that we can 
continue extending to Pakistan the support it needs," he said.

The talks he was referring to were with Finance Minister Ishaq Dar 
who was due here on Thursday to attend the World Bank/IMF meetings. 
During the IMF's periodic reviews, Mr Camdessus said, it was found 
that Pakistan had not fulfilled some of the conditions that were 
pledged.

One of the main conditions was the imposition of the GST but the 
Pakistan government had tried to resolve it in a peculiar way and 
it was not yet clear how the IMF would react to the solution found 
by Pakistan.

The IPPs issue is basically a World Bank issue but since the bank 
and the IMF work in close coordination, Pakistan has to fulfil all 
the conditions of both these organizations to get a go-ahead by the 
IMF's executive board.

Pakistan has recently been complaining that the IMF is also 
imposing political conditions like the signing of the CTBT for the 
release of the much-needed tranche.

A State Department official on Wednesday denied that the US was 
putting any pressure on the IMF to include CTBT signatures as part 
of the IMF conditions.

"They have to look at the economic performance to decide," the 
official said.

<a name="taxe">Tax evasion in Pakistan stands at Rs152 billion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 23: In Pakistan, total annual tax evasion stands at 
Rs 152 billion -sufficient to clear off the entire fiscal deficit 
without any additional tax levies.

This was stated in the Human Development in South Asia 1999 Report 
issued here on Thursday.

The report says that in Pakistan as much as 50 per cent of the 
total urban income goes un-reported.

Similarly tax evasion in India was estimated to be 18-21 per cent 
of GDP in 1980. Recently India was ranked among the top five 
countries noted for tax evasion in a sample of 53 countries.

For every dollar of public expenditures that is spent on social 
sectors, Pakistan spends more than four dollars on defence and debt 
servicing. India spends 70 per cent more on defence and debt-
servicing than on social sectors. For every dollar on social 
sectors, defence and debt servicing receive $8.65 in Pakistan and 
$3.12 in India.

HOW TO RULE: "Democracy in South Asia is not about people, it is 
about access to state power." This is the harsh conclusion of the 
1999 report which analyses the crisis of governance that grips the 
region.

All the South Asian countries, except Bhutan, share at least the 
formal trappings of democracy. Why then, despite their democratic 
leanings, have South Asian states failed to provide their people 
freedom from the worst forms of deprivations?. This paradox forms 
the political crux of South Asia's crisis of governance, and it is 
such central question that the report addresses.

The report stresses the need to establish democracy and 
participation beyond mere voting. It points to some disturbing 
features of the state of democracy in the region.

Confidence in state systems varies, with only 30 to 40 per cent of 
voters in most countries feeling they have access to elected 
representatives. It seems that people trust institutions but not 
the individuals who run them.

In India and Pakistan, between one-third and one-half of 
parliamentarians are landlords. In addition, big industrialists, 
civil and military bureaucrats, and political dynasties remain 
power players to varying degrees across the region.

The civil service is growing- the size of the public sector has 
increased between two and four times since the mid 1970s; 
overstaffed (especially at lower levels); underpaid; politically 
influenced; and unable to deliver public services to people 
transparently and equitably.

Parliaments are elitist, poorly attended, dominated by the 
majority, and not open to women and minorities. Women form just 2 
to 11 per cent of the region's parliamentarians.

<a name="move">Move to reduce gas prices may affect foreign investment </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Kamal Siddiqi

KARACHI, Sept 18: In what is being seen as a disincentive to 
foreign investment in Pakistan, the ministry of petroleum is 
pressing oil and gas exploration companies operating in the country 
for blanket revision of producer gas prices to cover the life-time 
of their discoveries.

This proposal has come from the ministry's side after some leading 
companies in the field made an offer of a longer term revision in 
prices. "This gesture of goodwill has been misinterpreted by the 
government to include the whole industry and we are all going to 
suffer," said the head of one of the international companies in 
this sector, while asking not to be named. But what may be termed a 
short term victory for the ministry of petroleum, may end up being 
a long-term loss for Pakistan's foreign investment prospects, oil 
and gas exploration companies have warned the Pakistan government.

The crux of the problem between the oil and gas exploration 
companies and the Pakistan government relates to pricing - the rate 
at which the government buys gas from the companies that have 
discovered it.

Under the 1994 petroleum policy introduced by the Bhutto 
government, the sale price of gas was linked to international oil 
prices so that international oil and gas companies would take the 
risk to come into Pakistan with their expertise and make 
discoveries.

Economists were predicting that Pakistan will be facing a shortfall 
of gas if new discoveries do not come on line within the next ten 
years. Pakistan meets 37% of its energy requirements from natural 
gas compared to 46% from oil. But recent government moves suggest 
that dependence on natural gas will grow considerably in the 
decade, tilting the ratio against oil.

One option that the government was considering was importing gas 
from either Qatar, Turkmenistan or Iran. However, discoveries made 
under the 1994 and 1997 petroleum policies by oil and gas 
exploration companies were better than ever: over the past four 
years, the companies have discovered over 8 TCF (trillion cubic 
feet) of gas - almost equal to the reserves in Sui.

In 1998, when Pakistan exploded its nuclear devices and 
subsequently suffered from economic sanctions imposed by G-8 
countries, one of the first areas to suffer were the oil and gas 
exploratory companies which saw payments due to them from the 
government gas distributors being withheld on account of a resource 
crunch. On pressure from international financial institutions, 
however, this matter was resolved in 1999.

In July 1999, the government dropped a bombshell when it informed 
the international oil and gas companies that it was not possible to 
honour agreements signed with the companies under the 1994 and 1997 
petroleum policies.

Much to the anger of the companies, most of which are large 
international players which have come to Pakistan after much 
thought on their side and incentives on the government's side, the 
government asked them to negotiate a new gas pricing structure.

The problem was simple: after international oil prices rose to a 
20-month high of $20 per barrel, the government could not match the 
payments it made to the gas companies. Understanding the 
predicament that the government was in, the representative body of 
the Pakistan Petroleum Exploration And Production Companies 
Association (PPEPCA), entered into talks with the government of 
resolving the issue. But gas companies say that they are prepared 
for re-negotiations on the prices of gas for "specific short term 
period of interim relief." The government wants the scaling down of 
prices for a longer term. It has threatened to make the issue, till 
now being conducted in a very civil atmosphere, into a more IPP's 
like situation.

<a name="newp">New pricing mechanism for gas offered</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Sept 22: Pakistan has proposed a new pricing mechanism to 
gas producers for buying new discoveries that offers a minimum 
price but caps increases caused by higher international oil prices, 
a senior government official said.

Gas company sources say they were willing to discuss the formula 
with the government but want the pricing floor to be inflation 
indexed.

Industry analysts have said if the dispute over what the government 
is willing to pay for gas is not resolved, it could end up 
mirroring the fight with foreign-backed independent power producers 
where a tariff row has hurt the investment climate.

'There is no policy change. This is an option if they are ready to 
talk to us, otherwise the government will go strictly by the 
policy,' said the official from the Ministry of Petroleum and 
Natural Resources.

The 1994 petroleum policy links gas prices to the weighted average 
of the C&F price per barrel of a basket of imported crude oil, but 
with oil prices hitting a 32-month high of $23 a barrel the 
government has become reluctant to buy the gas.

Under the policy the government is not bound to buy the gas, but at 
the time the companies were not worried because planned 
privatisation was expected to create other customers.

Those privatization plans have since been delayed, leaving the 
companies to sell to financially troubled state-run firms or to 
industrial consumers, but with added distribution costs.

Ceiling on gas prices: Industry sources said the government was 
using a legal loophole to push down prices, but the ministry 
official said the policy was drafted in consultation with the 
industry.

The official said under the new mechanism, the government would pay 
the policy price if international oil prices were between $10 to 
$15 a barrel.

But when oil prices are above $15 and up to $20, the policy price 
would go up by 50%, by 30% for above $20 and by 20% when oil prices 
went above $25 a barrel.

'It's not a fixed ceiling, it's a moving ceiling,' he said.
A senior executive at one foreign oil and gas company said the 
industry was discussing the formula with the government but wanted 
an allowance for inflation.

'Without indexation of the floor and ceiling (prices), we will not 
be able to convince our parent organisations,' he said.

The ministry official said: 'From our side they are still free, but 
so far only one discovery has been declared commercial, which is 
Lasmo's Bhit. If the discoveries are not at a commercial stage then 
there cannot be any question of an offer.' The Bhit field in Sindh 
is operated by the Pakistan unit of Britain's Lasmo Plc and has 
reserves estimated at 700 billion to 800 billion cubic feet.-

<a name="unre">Unregistered consumers to pay 15% GST</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 18: All gas and power consumers including domestic, 
commercial and industrial, not registered with the Sales Tax 
Department will pay 15 per cent GST in full , according to a 
Central Board of Revenue (CBR) announcement here on Saturday.

The CBR has projected that during the course of the year it would 
be able to collect Rs 8 billion from power consumers and Rs 12 
billion from gas consumers. A general order No 8/99, dated 
September 18, 1999, has been issued by the Sales Tax Department 
which says that the GST levied on gas and electricity from August 
16, 1999 would be deducted in full from the non-registered 
consumers.

Only the registered persons (who number about 60,000 throughout 
Pakistan), would be eligible to claim input adjustment (refund) of 
about 6 per cent. Out of the total GST levy of 15 per cent payable 
on the registered persons' electricity and gas bills, the tax 
payable would be about 9 per cent.

The registered persons have been asked to approach the billing 
sections of their respective gas and elasticity supplying companies 
to ledger their ST registration numbers against their consumer name 
and address.

The ST General Order No 8/99 reads: ST on "electricity" and also on 
"natural gas" has been levied with effect from August 16, 1999. The 
electricity bills and the gas bills, issued by the electricity and 
gas distribution and supplying companies shall be treated as the 
Sales Tax invoice under section 23 of the Sales Tax Act, 1990, and 
shall show the amount of ST payable by the consumers and customers.

This amount, as paid by the consumer and customer, during a tax 
period shall constitute input tax to determine the tax liability of 
a registered person in terms of section 7 (1) of the Sales Tax Act, 
1990, provided that such electricity and gas bill is in the name of 
the registered person.

Since a tax invoice, under section 23, requires printing of the 
name, address and registration number of the recipient, all 
commercial and industrial enterprises, registered with Sales Tax 
Department, are required to intimate to the billing section of the 

relevant electricity and gas supplying company about the full and 
correct name of the business enterprises (registered person), 
address at which the taxable activities and supplies are made, 
sales tax registration number and Common Taxpayer Identifier (CTI) 
number (if any) requesting them to insert these in their computer 
programs urgently.

The registered persons should also pursue such corrections by the 
respective billing companies and ensure that it is arranged as per 
the requirement, by October 31, 1999, respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 21: The federal cabinet on Tuesday approved, in 
principle, the report of the four-member ministerial committee to 
substantially increase revenues by framing and enforcing "stringent 
tax laws".

Finance and Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar presented the committee's 
report at the cabinet meeting which was presided over by Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif. The meeting will continue on Wednesday to 
approve the recommendations of the committee.

The report, according to informed sources, demanded that all kinds 
of political meddling in tax-collection process should be removed 
so that adequate collection of taxes could be ensured.

The report called for removing all prevailing tax exemptions and 
the areas like FATA and Azad Kashmir should also be brought under 
the tax net and that those who did not pay their taxes should be 
awarded "exemplary punishment".

Winding up of the all 48 diplomatic bonded warehouses was proposed 
with the committee proposing that only five such warehouses should 
be allowed to function.

Sources said that the report further called for liquidating loss-
making industries, specially those in the public sector. The report 
proposed that committees, headed by the concerned MNAs, be formed 
in the four provinces to curb smuggling.

Constituted by the prime minister, the four-member committee 
consisted of Mr Dar, Water and Power Minister Gohar Ayub, Labour 
Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, and state minister for water and 
power, Haleem Siddiqui.

The prime minister directed the finance ministry to take such "bold 
and imaginative" measures which simplified procedures and promoted 
economic revival.

According to Central Board of Revenue sources, the salaried persons 
are, however, required to file the employers' salary certificate 
which will meet the income-tax return formality.

The salary certificate can be filed collectively by the concerned 
department of the employees, or the employees themselves 
individually.

The CBR sources clarified that if an employee had some other source 
of income, he would have to submit the income-tax return. Those 
whose income exceeds Rs200,000 per annum are also required to file 
wealth tax return.

Previously, the limit for wealth tax return was Rs100,000 which has 
now been increased to Rs200,000 in the budget for fiscal 1999-200.

September 30 is the deadline for filing employers' salary 
certificate and income-tax returns.-APP

<a name="taxp">Tax-payers audit on one-time basis: CBR</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 23: Central Board of Revenue has announced that in 
future the audit of taxpayers by the Sales Tax and Central Excise 
be carried out on one-time basis.

Both the ST and CED auditors would be visiting the taxpayers' 
premises together, and a simpler method of auditing would be 
applied.

According to a press release issued by Sales Tax Department here 
Thursday the following criteria has been laid out for conduct of 
audit of registered units/persons with a view to streamlining the 
audit of registered units/persons including composite units paying 
excise duty as well as sales tax and to eliminating the grievances 
of the trade and industry in this regard:

Audit of any registered person/unit in routine will be conducted 
once during a financial year. However, in exceptional circumstances 
and under the specific instructions in writing by the collector 
concerned, a particular registered person/unit can be re-audited 
for that financial year or within that financial year.

In case of composite units manufacturing and supplying excisable 
and sales taxable goods, a joint audit will be conducted by the 
team of officials of sales tax and excise collectorates. Whenever 
such a registered person is selected by sales tax collectorate for 
audit, the respective excise collectorate will be informed at least 
10 days in advance and the collector excise may nominate hi9s 
representative for conducting a joint audit. The team will prepare 
a report for the respective collectorates regarding any discrepancy 
in the records and any tax liability thereon.

The staff of the directorate general of intelligence and 
investigation (customs, excise and sales tax and directorate 
general of inspection, internal audit and training (internal audit 
and inspection wing) will not undertake any audit of any registered 
person/unit 3except under specific written authorisation by the CBR 
in each such individual case. However in case of any information 
regarding evasion of sales tax or any other illegal activity on the 
part of any registered person, the respective directorate will pass 
on the information to the concerned collector of sales tax who will 
order for the audit of that particular unit by the sales tax 
auditors/special auditors. The representative of the said 
directorate/directorate general may also be associated while 
conducting such an audit of the said registered person/unit.

<a name="cedo">CED on petrol, furnace oil, diesel notified</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 23: The federal government has imposed Central 
Excise Duty on furnace oil, high speed diesel oil, light speed 
diesel oil, petrol (motor spirit), aviation spirit, spirit type jet 
fuel, JP-1, JP-4 and methyl tertiary butyle ether (MTBE).

The Central Board of Revenue here on Thursday issued two separate 
notifications to withdraw Customs Duty and in its place levy CED. 
Both notifications dated Sept 22, 1999, bear the same number: C. No 
2 (5)-CEB/999.

The Customs notification says that import duty so far levied at the 
rate of 10 per cent on petroleum crude oil, and all the above items 
has been withdrawn.

According to these two notifications, central excise duty of Rs 
35.25 per ton has been imposed in place of 10 per cent Customs duty 
on furnace oil.

In case of high speed diesel oil, Customs duty of 10% has been 
withdrawn while CED at Rs 0.25 per litre has been imposed.

Light speed diesel oil would now be levied CED at Rs 0.04 per litre 
in place of the Customs duty previously charged at the same rate.

Motor spirit, previously charged Customs duty at 10 per cent ad 
val, would now be charged CED at Rs 0.88.

In case of JP-1 and JP-4, CED at Rs 0.06 per litre has been 
imposed. JP-1 has previously been charged Customs Duty at 10 per 
cent ad val while JP-4 faces no change in rate as converted from 
the Customs to the CED regime.

Spirit type jet fuel, previously levied Customs Duty at Rs 0.06, 
would now be charged CED at Rs 0.88.

Aviation spirit, previously levied Customs Duty at Rs 0.88 per 
litre, would now be charged CED at the same rate. The same goes for 
the methyl tertiary butyle ether (MTBE) CBR has also clarified that 
there has been no levy of GST on furnace oil during the past few 
days.

It says: it is incorrectly reported that the federal government has 
imposed 15% GST on furnace oil during the last few days.

The exemption from sales tax on all petroleum products (including 
furnace oil) was withdrawn on 16th August, 1999 vide notification 
No SRO 922(I)/99. No further or new GST has been imposed on furnace 
oil since then.

Furnace oil is used for generation of electricity or for further 
production of goods. The GST paid on furnace oil will be fully 
adjustable against the GST payable on the output (for e.g. sales 
taxable electricity and other sales taxable goods) and, therefore, 
the effect of GST on furnace oil will be fully neutralized.

There will be no price effect on electricity or any other taxable 
industrial production due to withdrawal of exemption of sales tax 
on furnace oil which has already taken effect from 16th August, 
1999.

tezabi price has moved up at Rs4,664 from Rs4,553 per 10 gm two 
days ago. 

Gold 22 carat, which sold at Rs4,173 few days ago, is now 
available at Rs4,276. The 21 carat variety of gold has also become 
dearer at Rs4,081 from Rs3,984. Association leader Ahmed Khalid 
said short supply of gold in the international markets was mainly 
responsible to push up its rates. 

The new gold rate, he said, were not Pakistan specific. The gold 
price had gone up globally, he added. Markets here reported normal 
business on Thursday.

"Most gold dealers have been doing normal business as new 
fluctuation seem to have made no mark on buyers. There is no short 
supply of gold. No panic selling or buying", a goldsmith at the 
main sarafa bazaar here said.

Reports from Multan Sarafa Bazaar and bullion market of Faisalabad 
also reported increase in gold rates but no noticeable change in 
business pattern.

<a name="stoc">Stocks fall across broad front</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 24: Stocks on Friday fell across a broad front as 
investors sold in a bit haste amid reports that the Hubco has 
sought sovereign guarantee from Pakistan owing to reported failure 
of the WAPDA to meet its payment obligations. The KSE 100-share 
index shed 8.42 points at 1,191.84.

There was a near-panic in the rings after the trading resumed as 
investors failed to understand the implications of Hubco and 
followed the lead of the leading ones, who were in haste to 
liquidate positions fearing a big sell-off.

At one stage its share fell as low as Rs18.30 but late speculative 
support aided by news that WAPDA has indicated to settle the 
dispute with the Hubco and some positive statement is due any time. 
It finally finished off the day's bottom rate at Rs18.90.

Invoking of the sovereign guarantee clause by the Hubco in its 
London meeting stipulates, under the power purchase agreement, that 
the government of Pakistan will have to take a stake in its equity 
worth over $400 million owing to the protracted row over the tariff 
cut.

'The Hubco issue has now assumed an alarming proportions, closing 
the door for any amicable settlement', this was the general 
consensus among the stock analysts.

Investors, notably the small ones have suffered massive battering 
during the last about 30 months, eroding a bigger part of their 
saving in the form of price erosion.Its share has fallen from 
Rs60.00 to Rs18.90 after touching the low at Rs7.65 at one stage, 
they added.

However, the market will behave will be known by the next week when 
investors will be able to fathom the implications of Hubco move.

Minus signs dominated the list, with most of the leading shares, 
notably the MNCs being the major losers under the lead of Galaxo-
Welcome, Knoll Pharma, Shell Pakistan, Singer Pakistan, which 
suffered fall ranging from Rs3.00 to Rs7.50.

Other leading losers were led by Bank of Punjab, Islamic Bank, 
Cherat Cement, BOCK Pakistan, Pak Leather and Diamond Industries, 
falling by Rs1.05 to 2.20.

Gainers were led by Rafhan Best Foods, which again came in for 
strong speculative support after two days lull and was marked up by 
Rs46.85 to Rs.234.35 but only 100 share changed hands owing to 
shortage of the floating stock.

Other good gainers were led by Bannu Woollen, Colgate Pakistan and 
Lever Brothers Pakistan, which rose by Rs2.50 to Rs10.00.

Trading volume showed further fall at 117m shares as compared to 
145m shares a day earlier as losers forced a strong lead over the 
gainers at 99 to 50, with 48 shares holding on to the last levels.

Hub-Power topped the list of most actives, lower 15 paisa at 
Rs18.90 on 44m shares, followed by PTCL off 20 paisa at Rs20.95 on

DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Active trading was again witnessed on this 
counter as eight share came in for trading and generally finished 
steady under the lead of Mian Textiles, which was quoted unchanged 
on 5,00 shares.

Gammon Pakistan, which fell by 70 paisa on 1,000 shares was the

Ardeshir Cowasjee

IF we are to leap into the next century and, after the passage of 
half a century, be capable of standing on our own feet and dealing 

with the First World our people will have to be educated in the 
profound sense of the word.

A few, very few, have been advocating education for all since early 
this century. Nawrojee Nusserwanjee Pochajee, an enlightened Parsi 
of Karachi, left half his considerable fortune for the building of 
a school, specifically a girls' school, and his money was the seed 
money with which the Mama Parsi Girls' School was established in 
Karachi in 1908. As he rightly put it, it is girls who become 
mothers and at whose feet children learn what no school or college 
can teach them.

Up to 1947, the school restricted itself to girls of the Parsi 
community, but then, on the request of Mohammed Ali Jinnah it 
opened its doors to those of all communities. Now, 52 years later, 
95 per cent of the girls learning there are Muslims.

Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif recently gave a birthday present to the 
daughter of his erstwhile benefactor, General Zia-ul-Haq, drawing 
money from public funds provided to him to be used at his 
discretion. He later realized his mistake and reportedly has 
reimbursed the fund. The question arises : should he have used 
public funds for personal gain? Would a truly educated man do so? 
Some maintain that he knowingly did wrong, others that he did so 
truly believing that the people's money is his to do with as he may 
please. Whichever way one looks at it, the pointer is towards an 
uneducated man.

According to this newspaper's calculations, our prime minister has 
so far, during this his second round, made 51 foreign trips. On 
each, he has taken with him as many joyriders as his, or our, large 
Boeing can accommodate, and the expenses of each trip have been 
debited to the people. His flunkies follow suit. Some of his 
governors and chief ministers fly around the country in their 
special planes on personal and pleasure trips claiming that to do 
so is their 'entitlement.'

The trip record entitlement reportedly stands with our Rhodes 
Scholar, Wasim Sajjad, the Permanent Chairman of the Upper House, 
who sits one breath away from the presidency. It is said that since 
he sat in his chair he has made over 88 trips abroad at the 
people's expense. There may be a corrective letter from his office 
claiming he has not made 88 trips, but what the letter will not 
inform us is that he has actually scored 93 and is well on his way 
to his century.

My friend Ilahi Bakhsh Soomro, boss of the Lower House, is 
endeavouring to catch up. He uses his entitlement to depart every 
two to three months with a clutch of MNAs who form a 'parliamentary 
delegation' to attend various meetings around the world. We are not 
told whether they go to learn or to instruct, but we do know that 
they return home as educated as they were.

This 'entitlement' attitude is pernicious and destructive. One of 
Benazir Bhutto's governors, Kamal Azfar, grew up in the house of 
his father, Mohammad Azfar, an officer of the ICS and later of the 
CSP, a man who cannot be faulted, and who today is the oldest 
living civil servant in the country. A frail man, he has always 
lived within his means and can hold his head high as he has the 
rare distinction of having left the service on differing with Ayub 
Khan on a point of principle. He and his wife brought up their 
children well. Kamal went to Baliol at Oxford, one of the world's 
finest colleges, and was called to the Bar from the Inner Temple. 
He then studied with the famous scholar Gunar Myrdal.

As Governor of Sindh Kamal gave from his discretionary fund a sum 
of Rs.10 lakhs to the rich Karachi Golf Club for it to build a 
gallery in which a plaque with his name engraved upon it would be 
placed. Now, again we must ask whether an educated man would do 
this?

Following Kamal's example, the famous banker M. B. Abbasi, before 
he ran the NDFC dry, gave Rs.15 lakhs from our financial 
institution to have his name engraved on a plaque to be placed on a 
pavilion.

Following the example of Mian Nawaz Sharif, would both these 
gentlemen be willing to repay the public exchequer? Should either 
claim to be in a state of virtual penury, as a member of the Golf 
Club I will vote that the Club repay what it wrongfully accepted, 
enabling them to pay back to the people what they wrongfully used.

Now we come to what the Foreign Office calls the 'non-official 
component of the Pakistan delegation' to the United Nations General 
Assembly. Each year the Assembly meets for about three months and 
non-officials are invited by the government to go on a jaunt to New 
York at its expense. Each delegation of five to ten members is 
scheduled to stay fifteen days at the UN. This time I was put in 
the ring by the FO on the prime minister's directive. Why? The 
prime minister knows me well enough, he says he reads what I write. 
We have known each other for some time and he knows what I think of 
him as a man (I like him) and as a prime minister (a complete 
disaster). Would an educated man have included my name in the list 
of UN delegates?I informed the foreign secretary that I would not 
go. The next day I read in this newspaper that the non-official 
components consisted of "Senator Akram Zaki, Ahsan Iqbal, MNA, and 
Chairman 2001 programme, Fakhr Imam, MNA, Mr Pervaiz Malik, MNA, 
Senator Javed iqbal (former chief justice, LHC), Dr Nasim Hasan 
Shah (former chief justice, Supreme Court), Syed Sharifuddin 
Pirzada, S M Zafar, Dr Hamida Khuhro, Dr Attiya Enayatullah, Dr 
Alexander John Malik, Bishop of Lahore, Mr P K Shahani, Mr S A 
Rahman, ambassador-at-large, Mr Mehdi Masood (former ambassador) Mr 
Hameed Haroon, Mr Ardeshir Cowasjee, and Ms Nasim Zehra." How many 
of these joy-riders will go (Nasim has refused) ?

Then I read "It is widely expected that either Ardeshir Cowasjee or 
Nasim Zehra will make a statement in the Fourth Committee of the 
General Assembly reaffirming the government's adherence to the 
principles of freedom of speech and the press in Pakistan."

Widely expected? By whom and why? Are Nasim and I not expected to 
know what is happening in this country? Have I not seen the marks 
left by the beatings inflicted on journalist Hussain Haqqani's 
bottom? Do we both not know how editor Najam Sethi's house was 
broken into by government goons in the middle of the night, how he 

was dragged away blindfolded and kept for a month in solitary 
confinement in safe-houses ?

Then there arrives a letter from the Foreign Office saying, "Please 
be informed that the Prime Minister has been pleased to nominate 
you as a special envoy to visit West Coast cities and Washington to 
explain post-Kargil situation to public representatives, think-
tanks and media."

The Prime Minister may not know, but surely the Foreign Office 
does, what happens when private individuals address think-tanks and 
the media in the US and how he is questioned? What could I possibly 
have told them about Kargil other than, as I have declared 
publicly, that it was an unmitigated disaster. Do I tell them that 
I come from an illiterate country of 140 million whose Senate 
Chairman, the same Rhodes scholar, will not permit debate or 
discussion on what is euphemistically known here as 'honour 
killings,' thus legalizing murder? Or, that I come from a country 
where the government sends in a mob to raid the Supreme Court to 
obstruct the course of justice, a raid filmed by the international 
media and by the court's own cameras, for which raid it was much 
later held by three judges of the same court that no one was 
responsible, implying that in actual fact it never took place? What 
do I say about the 'extra judicial' killings and of killings whilst 
in police custody?

As far as Kargil is concerned, we should do everything possible to 
put a damper on it, to try and make the world forget. Scapegoats 
are always created after blunders, and today it is the army that is 
being blamed. Some are led to believe that the prime minister was 
not aware of the operation. Whether he was or not, he must know 
that the buck stops at his table, or at the table of the Supreme 
Commander of our Armed Forces, President R. A. Tarar.

Things could be different if the fun-seekers and looters of the 
people's wealth ruling over us from Islamabad were answerable to a 
public that is literate and educated in the greater majority.

<a name="thec">The country deserves a fresh start</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

IT IS hard to figure out which is worse: the conspiracy of silence 
or the conspiracy of stupidity which holds sway over this country.

Take Kargil, now no longer just the name of a region in the 
Himalayas but a synonym for national humiliation. While it was a 
product of stupidity, its authors are being protected by the rules 
of silence which are always observed when self-inflicted disasters 
hit Pakistan.

It is hardly a secret any more that at a briefing in late 
October/early November last year various options for pepping up the 
freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir were presented by the top army 
leadership to the prime minister. Amongst these options was a 
proposal to exploit a wide gap which existed in the Indian defence 
line in the Kargil sector.

There was nothing new about this idea. As part of the army's 
contingency planning (it being the business of armies to plan for 

the future), it had been on the cards since the mid-eighties. 
Whatever the justifications advanced for this particular option 
(one of these being that inactivity on our part could encourage 
India to do another Siachen on us), the long and the short of it is 
that it was broadly accepted, the prime minister giving his 
concurrence to it. Had he not done so this plan would have been 
still-born.

Arguably, the top army leadership (and in this context the 
adjective 'top' is of special significance) should have proposed 
nothing of the kind. The army has always fancied itself as the 
conscience and brains of the nation. Conscience, fine, but where 
were its brains when a forward thrust in Kargil was being outlined 
for the prime minister's benefit? This was the top army 
leadership's blunder, compounded, of course, by the circumstance 
that most of the formation commanders were kept in the dark. At the 
time they had no inkling of what was about to be done in the army's 
name.

As for the prime minister, not only did he hear the scheme out and 
approve it, he went a step further and, ever a man in a hurry, said 
its time-frame should be compressed. It has been suggested in the 
prime minister's defence that he did not fully understand the 
implications of what was being discussed. Perhaps. But then he has 
no business being where he is.

There was no discussion of the Kargil forward movement in the DCC. 
Even the other service chiefs were not consulted. In other words, 
while a war tattoo, with all the potential of escalating, was being 
contemplated, there was a total absence of institutional 
consultation. In other words, a near-repeat of 1965. Which shows 
the respect Pakistani leaders have for the lessons of history.

To be fair to the top army leadership, the Vajpayee visit confused 
it. This visit and the preparations in hand for Kargil were at odds 
with each other. When this oddity was pointed out (to the quarters 
concerned), the answer in effect was: you do your work while I do 
mine. Thus was the route charted for the nation's greatest 
humiliation since General Niazi's surrender before the victorious 
Indian army in 1971.

In any other country after such a mess a guillotine would have been 
erected and heads would have rolled. After the breakthrough of the 
German army in France in 1940 Chamberlain found it impossible to 
continue as prime minister of Britain. He had to make way for 
Churchill. After the Suez crisis of 1956 Anthony Eden had to step 
down as prime minister. He had to accept responsibility for the 
debacle.

Pakistan obviously is a different country. Its leaders think they 
can get away with murder. No wonder both the civilian and military 
architects of our Suez seem little concerned about national 
humiliation. What they are looking out for is their survival. A 
tempest might be howling about their ears but they are hoping that, 
somehow, they will be able to ride out the storm.

Survival of course is a great political imperative and there is 
nothing wrong with wanting it, especially in a dump like ours where 
power is everything and the wilderness full of nameless terrors. 

But two things should be clear.

First, after such a disaster its twin architects have forfeited 
their respective mandates. To their titular authority they may 
cling on but their moral right to continue in their respective 
offices lies buried in the snows of Kargil.

Second, Pakistan will know no peace unless the spectre of Kargil is 
exorcized from its mind. Obsessed with survival, the government 
will be looking over its shoulder all the time and as a consequence 
unable to think or look ahead. The country will remain rooted to 
the same spot. The top army leadership too will be in a similar 
predicament, its effectiveness undermined by its uneasy conscience. 
The people of Pakistan may be guilty of many things but they don't 
deserve this.

But how is this spectre to be exorcized? The fates which rule our 
destiny are unlikely to be propitiated except by an offering of 
blood. In plain words this means that those responsible for this 
disaster must not only read the writing on the wall. They must also 
take a page out of history and look hard at the examples of 
Chamberlain and Eden.

Just before Chamberlain's fall, Leo Amery, a senior MP, borrowed 
these words from Oliver Cromwell to make his case for Chamberlain's 
departure: "You have sat too long here for any good you have been 
doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of 
God, go." The National Assembly is not the House of Commons and in 
the dumb and silent ranks of the Muslim League there are no Leo 
Amerys. Even so, Cromwell's words fit the situation we face. Those 
responsible for the Kargil fiasco should go. This is the least 
favour they can do the nation.

But there is an important caveat. Since the responsibility for this 
fiasco is two-fold, both the cooks of this broth should go. No 
scape-goating and no passing the buck. Either a two-fold cure or 
none at all. Half a solution will set nothing right and will only 
prolong the country's distress.

But there is a serious problem. Who will induce the twin architects 
of Kargil to follow the Roman example and fall on their swords?

Pakistan's affairs are out of order. The old system of checks and 
balances has collapsed. Parliament has abdicated its authority to 
the prime minister who in turn is guided in his decisions by a 
small and secretive group of advisers. The overriding aim of 
government is not what may loosely be defined as the national 
interest but the greater glory of a single family. In such a 
Byzantine circumstance accountability becomes an alien concept.

It is a barometer of our self-respect that leading Pakistani 
politicians are swept by gratitude, and a sense of their 
importance, if they can get someone to see them at the State 
Department. It is a measure of our pathetic condition that 
Washington should be telling us from the house-tops how to conduct 
our affairs: warning the army to desist from extra-constitutional 
actions; advising the government to respect democratic liberties. 
Even a banana republic would consider such public lecturing crude 
and excessive. But then we are hardly in a position to complain. 
This is what in our pitiable condition we have brought on 
ourselves.

<a name="aque">A question of faith</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

ALTHOUGH it often seems like a chore, going through my fan mail and 
hate mail as it arrives daily via the Internet gives me an 
invaluable insight into readers' concerns.

The other day, a Pakistani expatriate wrote saying that a Syrian 
friend of his was of the view that for historic reasons, democracy 
was unsuitable for Muslims. And in support of his argument, he 
cited the case of Pakistan as a Muslim country that had been trying 
to make the system work for years with scant success. Despite 
several military interventions, an inordinate number of elections 
have been held, but the governments they produced have been largely 
incompetent and corrupt. As a result, they have rarely completed 
their term of office.

While my reader's friend may have indulged in a rather sweeping 
generalization, it is an unpleasant but undeniable fact that Muslim 
countries are, largely speaking, governed by one authoritarian 
model or another, ranging from monarchy to military dictatorship to 
one-party rule. In Algeria and Turkey, the army has intervened to 
keep Islamic groups out of power although they had won a popular 
mandate. In Indonesia, there is growing concern about a military 
coup.

In Pakistan, too, the US government has felt it necessary to voice 
its opposition to extra-constitutional methods to unseat the Nawaz 
Sharif government. In virtually the entire Islamic Crescent from 
Turkey to Indonesia, human rights are trampled under foot by ruling 
oligarchs and despots. It is tempting to assert that this condition 
prevails across the Third World, but the fact is that countries 
like India, Sri Lanka, the Philippines and much of Latin America 
have, despite many problems, evolved working democratic systems. 
These may be flawed and far from perfect, but are nevertheless 
functioning and responding to the people's needs.

So what is it that has prevented democracy from taking root in 
Muslim countries? True, these countries have a long history of 
autocratic rule, but other nations have evolved from the same 
starting point to various stages of participatory government. Why 
is our environment so hostile to notions of human rights, equality 
and freedom? The lack of economic development cannot be cited as a 
valid reason as we have just observed that several underdeveloped 
countries have successfully made the transition from autocratic 
rule to democracy. Also, many oil-rich Islamic states have a high 
per capita income but are ruled by powerful monarchs.

There is one common thread running through Islamic societies, and 
that is the subordinate position of women. Although not all of them 
share the harsh fate of their Afghan sisters, it is an unfortunate 
fact that, by and large, Muslim women do not enjoy the same social, 
economic and political rights that women in the rest of the world 
do. Another common factor is the general lack of tolerance for 
other points of view that is so widely prevalent in much of the 
Muslim world. This is a prerequisite for democracy, and its absence 
could go a long way in explaining why we have generally failed in 
internalizing democratic norms and values.

Looking at successful democratic models, we note that without 
exception, they are all secular in outlook, having separated the 
church from the state at relatively early stages of their political 
development. In the case of Israel, the only state apart from 
Pakistan created in the name of religion, Jews and non-Jews vote 
together, whereas here Muslims and non-Muslims vote on the basis of 
separate electorates. Unfortunately, the difference does not stop 
here: Pakistani non-Muslims have been the targets of state-
sanctioned persecution through controversial legislation that has 
drawn protests from human rights groups in and out of the country.

So does secularism hold the key to democracy? Clearly, this 
question and its answer has major implications for the entire 
Islamic world. But it is important to take note of the fact that 
secularism by itself is no guarantee of democracy: Iraq and Syria 
are both secular states, both have unenviable human rights records, 
and both are ruled by men who are re-elected periodically. Needless 
to say, neither is opposed in the polls as they lead one-party 
regimes.

Nevertheless, by de-linking religion from politics, successful 
democracies have managed to lower the temperature of political 
discourse. In Islamic countries attempting to take the democratic 
route, we have the widely observed phenomenon of religious parties 
substituting dogma for substance. Also, the introduction of faith 
in the hurly-burly of politics reduces the space for rational 
debate by reducing arguments to black and white.

In all religions, we accept certain tenets as articles of faith 
without subjecting them to the acid tests of logic and reason. 
Indeed, the fundamentals are not open to question. This acceptance 
of a truth higher than our comprehension is essential for the 
unquestioning belief that underpins universal adherence to various 
faiths that attract the devotion of hundreds of millions around the 
world. However, because of schisms within Christianity, together 
with the bloodshed they caused, European nations separated the 
Church from politics centuries ago. Partly as a result, the level 
of tolerance increased over time and came to be central to a 
democratic dispensation.

The Islamic world, too, has witnessed splits and schisms from a 
very early period. More blood has been shed in the name of faith 
than in any other cause. But because of our belief that Islam 
provides a complete way of life and does not govern only the 
spiritual sphere, most Muslim countries have enshrined the 
provisions of the faith in their legislation. However, as a result 
of the existence of different schools of jurisprudence within 
Islam, it is not always possible to accommodate all their divergent 
views. This is bound to create tensions and differences that erupt 
into open warfare from time to time.

Although the teaching of Islam urges believers to practise ijtihad 
to find answers to the challenges of our times, blind followers of 
dogma have so far prevented such an enlightened approach. The 
result is a total calcification of institutions and a paralysis of 
the spirit of inquiry. These factors have not only resulted in a 
uniform environment of repression, but in all-round economic, 
social and intellectual backwardness that has come to characterize 
much of the Muslim world.

If we are to leave this prison and take our rightful place in the 
comity of nations, we will have to break the shackles we have bound 
ourselves with.

<a name="make">Pakistan make clean sweep of one-day series</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

TORONTO, Sept 20: Pakistan made it a clean sweep in the three-match 
one-day cricket international series on Sunday with a decisive 
seven-wicket victory over the West Indies in the final game.

Set just 162 to win after another lackluster West Indian batting 
effort, Pakistan cruised to the target for the loss of just three 
wickets with more than 10 overs of the 50-over contest to spare.

Pakistan began their run chase disastrously when Wajahatullah Wasti 
was bowled by Courtney Walsh in the first ball of the innings.

But that was really the last gasp of the Windies in an inevitable 
result.

Hasan Raza strode to the wicket to join in-form Abdur Razzaq, a 
half century maker on Saturday. The pair took the score along to 50 
in the 13th, tested out along the way by some hostile, short-
pitched bowling by Merv Dillon and Walsh.

A change of bowling eventually brought about a much-needed wicket. 
Jimmy Adams had Raza caught by Wavell Hinds at silly mid-off for 11 
in the 13th over.

Inzamam-ul-Haq joined Abdur Razzaq at the crease and, after an 
early scare when Inzamam was dropped on the boundary after skying a 
hook shot, the pair quickly stamped their authority on the match.

Delightful sweep and pull shots were a feature of Inzamam's 
innings.

The West Indies spinners - Adams, Gales and Chanderpaul - were not 
of the same quality as Pakistan's, putting pressure back on the 
pacemen to make a breakthrough.

But Inzamam and Razzaq were solid in defence when required, and 
particularly savage on bad balls, taking the score along to 136 for 
two and almost certain victory by the 32nd over.

Razzaq was finally out for a well-made 57 when he lost patience and 
was caught by Powell in the deep trying to hit the ball over the 
mid-wicket fence.

With only 26 runs required for victory, Inzaman and Yousuf Youhana, 
Pakistan's hero and century maker in Saturday's match, chipped away 
at the target with ones and twos to reach a total of 163 for three 
in just the 39th over and claim victory.

Razzaq won the Man-of-the-Match award for solid all-round 
performance. He took one for 31 in his eight over bowling spell and 

added 57 with the bat - his third One-day International half 
century and his second in as many days.-Reuters

<a name="8ths">8th SAF Games gets under way today</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KATHMANDU, Sept 24: Sri Lankan golden girl Damayanthi Darsha will 
carry her country's medal hopes into the 8th South Asian Federation 
Games but India are hot favourites to dominate when the 
extravanganza gets under way here on Saturday.

Asian Games sprint queen Darsha is entered in three events, and is 
Sri Lanka's standard bearer in the absence of three of the 
islanders' top track stars.

"We have definitely become quite weak due to the absence of 
Susanthika Jayasinghe, Sugath Tilakaratne and Chinthaka De Soyza. 
At least, 5-6 certain golds are in doubt now," said Jagath 
Jayasuriya, the Sri Lankan chef de mission.

But Jayasuriya is confident Darsha can repeat her successes from 
the Asian Games in Bangkok last December.

"Darsha will now take up the 100m, 200m and 400m. if everthing goes 
according to plan. She won't have any difficulty winning all three 
golds," he said.

Elsewhere in the seven-nation multi-sport gala, India are poised to 
take a stranglehold of the overall medal tally.

Having snaffled more than 100 golds at the last SAF Games, the 
strong Indian squad have set their sights on another similarly 
impressive haul.

With 161 golds on offer in 12 disciplines, most of the attention is 
expected to focus on the battle for second place in the medal-
rankings, with hosts Nepal determined to give their home fans 
something to cheer about.

Nepal sports officials are aiming for 15 gold medals and a third 
place ranking at the very least.

The introduction of martial arts disciplines taekwondo and karatedo 
at the Games has boosted Nepal's chances of posting their best-ever 
finish, according to team officials.

"Considering the depth that Nepal enjoys in these sports, Nepal is 
looking forward to winning at least 15 gold medals and a third 
place on the podium," said Dawa Gurung, the Nepalese chef de 
mission.

Many of Nepal's competitors in the two disciplines have warmed up 
for the SAF Games by taking part in various international 
tournaments, said Gurung, a top karate instructor in Nepal.

Gurung is also looking to athletes in other sports to bring home 
the medal booty.

"I am expecting some good results from our players in other 
disciplines like boxing, table tennis and shooting," he said.

In the team events, India is again expected to hold sway although 
arch-rivals Pakistan should mount a tough challenge in volleyball 
and kabaddi.

"We are well prepared for this occasion," said Khawaja Saeed 
Hassan, a Pakistani kabaddi offcial. "Our players have trained 
really hard for these Games and anything short of gold would be a 
disappointment".

A total of 1069 athletes are taking part in the Games. Most of the 
contingents have already arrived here for the ten-day mega-event of 
the South Asia.

While five countries, Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri 
Lanka are participating in all disciplines, the Maldives and Bhutan 
will only contest in six and five of the sports.

<a name="asia">Asian Sailing Championship begins today</a>

KARACHI, Sept 24: Eleven gold medals will be at stake, when the 9th 
Asian Sailing Championship begins on Saturday morning at the 
Defence Authority Marina Club.

Thirteen of the top nations in Asia will be vying for the top 
honours in this prestigious event in which 120 sailors, both male 
and female, will be matching their skills in the Enterprise, 
Europe, 420, Optimist, 470, Mistral and Laser events.

With Bangladesh and Kzakhstan pulling out of the championship, the 
remaining nations in the competition are China, Chinese Tapei, 
Indonesia, Japan, Kirgyzstan, Kuwait, South Korea, Sri Lanka, 
Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and the hosts Pakistan.

The first race begins at 10.00 a.m. after the Governor of Sindh, 
Mamnoon Hussain, inaugurates the gala at the colourful ceremony.

On the opening day the first races in the Enterprise, Optimist, 
Europe and 420, will get under way. The best of seven races with 
one discard will be conducted in all the 11 events.

Pakistan once a force to be reckoned with in the Enterprise and 470 
Class, will have to exploit their own conditions, like the wind and 
the water to dominate these events.

According to Monica Azon, the Spanish coach for the home team, 
Pakistan has a great chance in picking up the gold medal in the 
Enterprise and 470 Class.

She also thought Pakistan will do extremely well in the Optimist 
Class, both in the boys and girls events, not to mention the 
European Class for girls.

The hosts, however, will be facing an extremely daunting task from 
the South Koreans, who dominated the last sailing championship in 
the 1998 Asian Games held at Bangkok in the Enterprise, Laser, 470 
and Optimist.

Singapore will be another striking force, picking up gold medals in 
Bangkok in the Ladies 420 and Europe Class.

<a name="comm">Commission issues show cause notice to Ata</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LAHORE, Sept 23: Test paceman Ata-ur-Rahman was issued a show cause 
notice on Thursday for resiling from his statement before the one-
man inquiry commission comprising the High Court judge, Justice 
Malik Muhammad Qayyum. Ata-ur-Rahman has been asked to appear 
before the commission on Sept 30.

The judge asked Ata-ur-Rahman why action should not be taken 
against him for changing his statements. Ata's lawyer Tariq Shamim 
pleaded with the learned judge that because he was presiding over 
the inquiry commission, under section 476 of the PPC he could not 
use powers of a High Court judge. Justice Malik Muhammad Qayyum 
directed the High Court registrar Abdul Salam Khawar to provide a 
copy of the video-cassette to Ata-ur-Rahman.

Ata-ur-Rahman had accused Wasim Akram of promising him to pay Rs 
200,000 and had paid him Rs 100,000 for bowling badly in a match in 
New Zealand. 

Later, he resiled from his statement. On the third occasion, Ata-
ur-Rahman accused Test opener Aamir Sohail of persuading him to 
level charge against Wasim Akram of having paid him Rs 100,000 for 
bowling badly in the match against New Zealand.

The commission played video-cassette in the court provided by Test 
wicket-keeper Rashid Latif in which former captain Salim Malik's 
voice could be heard. The learned judge asked Salim Malik to 
explain on the next date of hearing what he meant by his wordings 
in the cassette.
