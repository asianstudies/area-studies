<a name="oppr">Oppressive steps led to Nawaz's overthrow: 
Human Rights Watch report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Dec 10: Saying that "there was near universal 
condemnation of the Oct 12 coup, "against Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif's government, nevertheless the Human Rights Watch World 
report-2000, has noted that "by suppressing opposition-led 
demonstrations and strikes, curtailing civil liberties through 
repressive ordinances, and persecuting independent NGOs and 
journalists, Sharif's administration left civil society battered".

In the report launched on Thursday at press conferences in New York 
and Washington DC, the HRW said: "Sharif alienated important 
elements in the army with his abrupt withdrawal of support in July 
for Muslim militants who had occupied strategic peaks overlooking 
Kargil, in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir. The subsequent 
retreat of the militants, reduced the danger of Pakistan's 
diplomatic isolation but engendered widespread domestic 
condemnation and proved to be the final catalyst in prompting a 
military takeover.

The report said that 'the most dramatic development during the year 
was the bloodless coup on Oct 12. Prime Minister Sharif dismissed 
General Parvez Musharraf as army chief, then tried to prevent the 
general's plane coming from Sri Lanka, from landing in Karachi. 
Within hours, the military launched its counterattack, and by the 
end of the day, Sharif was under arrest and the entire cabinet was 
under guard.

"Within days of the military takeover, the general suspended the 
constitution, abolished the national assembly and all provincial 
legislatures, announced the formation of a six-member national 
security council to give "guidance" to the cabinet of ministers, 
and banned the Supreme Court from challenging his authority. The 
general also promised to uphold freedom of the press and religious 
tolerance, to exercise nuclear restraint, withdraw some military 
forces from the Indian border, and to revive the country's battered 
economy while attacking high-level corruption. He said his was an 
interim government but gave no timetable for new elections. 
Reaction to the coup within the country was generally favourable," 
the report added.

The October coup capped a year of increasing discontent with the 
Sharif administration stemming from its crackdown on opposition 
political activity and increasing "encroachments on civil 
liberties, with the courts providing only occasional relief. After 
a GDA call for a protest rally in Karachi led to the arrest from 
Sept 24 to 26 of more than 1,000 opposition activists throughout 
the city, including much of the leadership of the Pakistan People's 
Party, senior leaders of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), the 
Awami National Party, and the Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaaf party. Most 
were released on bail on Sept 28, although magistrates rejected the 
bail applications of some senior figures, including Senators 
Nasreen Jalil and Aftab Sheikh of the MQM."

On Feb 17, in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court declared that 
the military courts set up by the federal government in late 1998 
to try civilians for political, sectarian and ethnic violence were 
unconstitutional, and ordered that cases pending in military courts 
be transferred to anti-terrorism courts or other courts established 
within the law. The federal government responded by amending the 
1997 Anti-Terrorism Act so as to give anti-terrorism courts 
jurisdiction over the same categories of offences as the military 
courts. In the amended act, the definition of terrorism was 
extended to include "acts of civil commotion," a term that included 
the "commencement or continuation of illegal strikes" as well as 
"distributing, publishing or pasting of a handbill or making 
graffiti or wall-chalking intended to create unrest or fear."

Seven anti-terrorism courts were established in Karachi in early 
May. One case was tried in apparent violation of Pakistan's 
constitutional guarantees against double jeopardy. Mohammed Saleem 
had been acquitted by a military appellate court on January 6 of 
involvement in the murder of three police officers, after the court 
failed to establish a motive or find substantial evidence linking 
him to the crime. However, police again arrested Saleem on May 13 
and brought him before an anti-terrorism court to face a second 
trial on the same charges. On June 11, Saleem was convicted and 
sentenced to death. The court rejected Saleem's contention that he 
was below the age of sixteen - which under Sindh provincial law 
would have precluded capital punishment - after a court-ordered 
medical examination found him to be between the ages of twenty and 
twenty-one.

On the issue of women's rights the HRW said that Sharif led 
"government repeatedly failed to uphold the civil liberties of 
women or to punish "honour killings."

On August 3, the Pakistani Senate voted to block debate over a 
draft resolution condemning incidents of violence against women. 
Only four members of the Senate voted in favour of discussing the 
draft, itself a substantial dilution of an earlier text that 
specifically condemned Sarwar's murder. "

On Sharif's government's relations with the press the HRW said: " 
The government's intimidation of the news media emerged as an issue 
of international concern, as authorities targeted some leading 
newsmen and journalists by arresting and resorting to other 
repressive measures for cooperating with a BBC team producing a 
documentary about government corruption in Pakistan.

On the issue of Human Rights Organizations and the closure of NGOs 
during the Sharif government, the report said: "The Punjab 
provincial government shut down nearly 2,000 NGOs, imposed 
restrictions on the registration of new groups, and began drafting 
a law that would facilitate its ability to regulate the province's 
remaining NGOs. A similar crackdown on NGO activities, albeit on a 
smaller scale, was underway in Sindh. Although local NGO activists 
noted that many of the banned organizations existed in name only, 
they said the move also targeted groups that had done critical 
reporting on human rights issues. All NGOs in Punjab were asked to 
seek clearance from provincial and federal intelligence agencies 
before they could allowed to work and making a written pledge that 
they were not involved in anti-state, anti-government, or anti-
religion activities.

On May 10, the department revoked the registration of 1,941 NGOs, 
shutting down nearly one third of the 5,967 NGOs registered in the 
province.

All of the disbanded organizations were registered under the 
Voluntary Social Welfare Agencies (Registration and Control) 
Ordinance. However, several major NGOs, including the Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), are registered under the Societies 
Act and are technically outside the jurisdiction of the Social 
Welfare Department. The Punjab government subsequently announced 
that all NGOs in the province would henceforth be registered under 
the Social Welfare Ordinance. It also began drafting a law that 
would enable it to dissolve NGOs registered under the Societies Act 
and to seize their assets. As of October, however, government 
representatives and an NGO committee were engaged in a dialogue 
about the need for such a bill and its possible content.

The report noted that "although the crackdown on NGOs was centred 
in Punjab, similar campaigns were initiated in other provinces. In 
Sindh, the government cancelled the registration of 273 NGOs, out 
of a total of about 5,282 NGOs registered in the province, because 
of their alleged involvement in anti-state activities and 
corruption and initiated inquiry against some.

The report pointed out "In April, Radhika Coomaraswamy, the UN 
Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women, expressed concern 
over the growing number of "honour crimes" in Pakistan, 
particularly the murder of Samia Sarwar. Coomaraswamy urged the 
government of Pakistan to seriously address the issue of honour 
killings and support crisis centres and shelters for women victims, 
adding that "the government of Pakistan should take all necessary 
steps to protect the lives of Asma Jehangir and her colleagues." In 
October, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the ouster of 
the civilian government and urged General Musharraf to take early 
steps to "restore civilian rule and the constitutional process."

On the issue of sectarian violence, the report noted "sectarian 
violence escalated in scale and geographic scope, as Shia leaders 
and communities came under attack not only in Punjab, where the 
attacks had increased manifold.

<a name="uswa">US wants 'highest-level' talks between India, Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW DELHI, Dec 5: The United States favours talks "at the highest 
level" between India and Pakistan on all irritants, including 
Kashmir, the US envoy to New Delhi said on Sunday.

Ambassador Richard Celeste told the Press Trust of India that 
Washington was concerned peace talks between the two countries 
should resume soon.

"We continue to take the position that it will be very valuable for 
India to engage Pakistan at the highest level on issues that 
trouble the relationship between the two countries...

"We are concerned that the momentum (of a prime ministerial meeting 
in February in Lahore) is not completely lost," he said.

The Lahore declaration was signed by Indian Prime Minister Atal 
Behari Vajpayee at a landmark summit in February with the ousted 
prime minister Nawaz Sharif. It called for intensifying efforts to 
resolve outstanding issues, including that of Kashmir.

Celeste said "a great deal of trust" had been "damaged" on account 
of a two-month conflict earlier this year between Indian soldiers 
and the Mujahideen. Celeste conceded that it would be "awkward" for 
Vajpayee to deal with a "non-elected leadership in Pakistan that 
suddenly carries some responsibility."

The ambassador said that even the "smartest and wisest" American 
could not fashion a workable solution to the Kashmir tangle.

"We believe this will require extraordinary leadership from this 
country and Pakistan and on behalf of people of Kashmir," he said.

The ambassador forecast "promising" ties between India and the US 
in the coming years, saying: "We want a thriving and broad-based 
relationship with India.

"We don't believe that the relationship should be defined by how we 
treat Pakistan."-AFP

<a name="ceto">CE to restore democracy: US to block Pakistan's economic collapse</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Dec 10: The US on Thursday assured Pakistan it will not 
oppose IMF and World Bank funds but a senior State Department 
official urged General Pervez Musharraf to announce "milestones and 
a clear timetable" for a return to constitutional, civilian and 
democratic governance.

The US assurance was given by Under Secretary of State Thomas 
Pickering at a major foreign policy speech at a George Washington 
University forum on US relations with Pakistan, India and Iraq, 
released officially by the State Department on Thursday.

It was the most exhaustive comment made by any senior US official 
on relations with the two South Asian countries in many months and 
was seen in the context of laying a framework for a possible visit 
by President Clinton to the region next year.

"Our agenda with Pakistan is thus both broad and delicate as we 
seek the restoration of democracy while remaining engaged with a 
country whose course of action has tremendous effect on the 
security of the region and with whom we share long ties," he said.

Pickering said US-Pakistan relations had been affected by the end 
of the Cold War "in more complex and sometimes contradictory ways."

"The end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan held out great 
hope for increased stability in the region - but instead, 
Afghanistan has dissolved into an intractable civil war, placing 
obvious pressures on Pakistan."

Pickering said the political crisis that erupted in Pakistan in 
October was at the top of the US agenda. "One of our newest and 
greatest issues with Pakistan is that democracy be restored 
promptly," he said.

"While many Pakistanis favour fundamental change, and the move by 
the military has substantial public support, they do not appear to 
want the military to stay in power for a protracted period," he 
observed.

"Sadly enough, failures by both the Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto 
governments have coloured perceptions of what democracy can 
accomplish in Pakistan," he said.

"Opium production has declined from 175 tons to less than 40 tons 
in this period, while opium and heroin seizures have increased 
exponentially.

"Pakistan's efforts to attack narcotics problems are more 
constrained by a severe economic crisis than by lack of political 
will. High-level political support for anti-narcotics is continuing 
in the new regime," he said.

<a name="noso">No softening of Pakistan stand: India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

 NEW DELHI, Dec 9: India said on Thursday October's change of 
government in Pakistan had not resulted in a softening of 
Islamabad's aggressive stance and hostility towards New Delhi.

"The 'military coup' in Pakistan has not altered Pakistan's 
aggressive approach, hostile policies and propaganda towards 
India," Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh said in a written response 
to a question in the Lok Sabha.

"Pakistan's sponsorship of 'cross-border terrorism in the state of 
Jammu and Kashmir' and elsewhere in India has continued unabated."

Singh alleged Pakistan forces had continued firing across the Line 
of Control and the working boundary in Kashmir.

"Pakistan has made no moves to withdraw troops from the Line of 
Control, where they had been inducted in large numbers during its 
armed intrusion and aggression in the Kargil sector," he alleged.-

<a name="paki">Pakistan can meet energy needs: experts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Dec 6: Using only 20 per cent efficient devices, solar 
energy falling on 25 per cent of Balochistan area is enough to meet 
requirements of present-day total energy consumption of Pakistan, 
solar energy experts said.

Pakistan, being unlucky country with regards to fuel reserves, has 
to switch over to solar energy ultimately for its ever growing 
needs.

According to energy experts, with the current rate of supplies, the 
total reserves of oil and gas in Pakistan will last 12 years. 
However coal will take about 200 years to exhaust which can face 
tough resistance from environmentalists while hydro- power can meet 
only upto one-fifth of the present energy demand. With this 
situation, Pakistan is left with the only option to develop and 
adopt renewable energy technologies for the requirement of 14 
million people living in cities and villages.

Among all renewable sources, the solar energy is the most abundant 
and widely spread in Pakistan. The mean global irradiance falling 
on horizontal surface amounts to about 1.9-2.3 MWh per square meter 
in a year. 

It has been estimated that using only 20 per cent efficient devices 
solar energy falling on 25 per cent of Balochistan area is enough 
to meet requirements of total energy consumption of Pakistan, 
experts said.

Photovoltaics, developed for converting the solar energy into 
electricity is also good for producing H2 through electrolysis. 
This H2 can completely replace our oil and gas requirements.

Dr Pervez Akhtar, Director General of National Institute of Silicon 
Technology told APP that among all renewable energy sources, the 
solar energy is in abundance, pollution free, widely distributed, 
freely available and covering wide-range of applications and is 
becoming the most popular source of clean energy.

He said energy technologists are now convinced that the development 
and adaptation of energy technologies can bring revolution in the 
lifestyle and living standards of low income group in extreme 
remote areas. However, till today, he said these energy 
technologies have not been properly exploited for a number of 
reasons including the fear of high cost, lack of motivation, and 
incentives, inadequate demonstration of effective use, non-
availability of suitable systems, non- existence of proper 
infrastructure, trained manpower and market places and regions 
where demand exists.

Due to campaign and pressure from the environmentalists, the 
multinational companies have started investing huge amount on 
research in solar energy as they think that solar energy will 
become ultimately prime source of energy.

Dr Pervez said the NIST besides developing photovoltaics for 
producing electricity, the heat character of solar radiation is 
also exploited for wide range of applications. This includes water 
heating for domestic or industrial applications, space heating and 
air conditioning, solar architecturing, solar cooking, drying 
agricultural products, water desalination, cleaning and sterilizing 
surgical components and lot more.

Dr Pervez has invited the private sector to pick the technologies 
from his institute for commercial use.-APP

<a name="hear">Hearing from Jan 31: SC admits writs against army takeover</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec 6: The Supreme Court on Monday admitted the 
petitions of Pakistan Muslim League and others challenging the 
military takeover for regular hearing from January 31, 2000 on day-
to-day basis.

The court, however, declined to stay the proceedings against 
deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif and others before the Anti-
Terrorism Court in Karachi. The court also issued notices to all 
the bar associations of the country and the advocate generals of 
the four provinces to appear and give their point of view in the 
case.

The court, however, did not issue notices to Chief Executive Gen 
Pervaiz Musharraf and Corps Commander Lt-Gen Mehmood Ahmed. Both of 
them were impleaded as respondents by Syed Zafar Ali Shah, PML(N) 
member of the suspended National Assembly in his petition.

The bench, headed by Chief Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, consisted 
of Justice Bashir Jehangiri, Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, Justice 
Abdur Rehman Khan and Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed.

Apart from PML's representative petition there are four other 
petitions. Syed Zafar Ali Shah, in his separate petition, has 
sought restoration of assemblies and PML government.

Habib Wahabul Kheiri in his petition has challenged provisional 
constitutional order 1 (PCO-1), of 1999 to the extent of its being 
violative of judicial independence. Syed Iqbal Haider of MWM sought 
validation of the military takeover.

Shahid Orakzai asked the court to restore the Senate and the 
offices of the speakers of all the legislative assemblies for 
bringing the democratic system back on track.

On Monday when the court proceedings started Attorney General Aziz 
A. Munshi, who was on court notice, argued that there was no need 
for issuance of notices to the chief executive and the corps 
commander. The court room was packed to capacity.

The federal law minister argued that the notice to the federation 
was sufficient as the chief executive and the corps commander were 
part of the federation. He also questioned the jurisdiction of the 
court to proceed with the case as the court had no authority to 
pass any order with regard to PCO 1. His argument, however, was 
rejected by the Chief Justice immediately who observed the issue, 
whether an act of the armed forces was challengeable or not, had 
already been decided in Zaheerul Islam Abbasi case.

Zafar Shah contended that notice to the respondents was necessary. 
He stated that notice to the federation would mean notice to Mian 
Nawaz Sharif "who is still the elected prime minister". Notice to 
the federation would not be notice to Gen Pervaiz Musharraf, he 
maintained.

Former federal law minister Khalid Anwar, who filed the PML(N) 
representative petition, contended that he had no objection if the 
attorney general was ready to accept notice on behalf of every 
responsible.

Justice Zahid inquired from the AG that if the court had any query 
about the acts of Gen Musharraf and Lt-Gen Ahmed, would it be the 
duty of the AG to respond to those.

The AG said when he was stating before the court that there was no 
need for issuing notice to the generals as they were part of the 
federation, he meant something.

Mr Orakzai stated that notice to the chairman of joint chiefs of 
staff committee and the president was necessary as in his petition 
he had raised such points which needed response from both the 
respondents. He further contended that one counsel could not 
represent two persons.

Syed Iqbal Haider contended that there was no need for issuance of 
notice to the individuals as the military takeover was an 
institutional reaction against an illegal order.

The court observed that it would also issue notices to the Supreme 
Court Bar Association, high court bar associations and the vice-
presidents of the bar councils to appear and give their point of 
view.

The court, after inquiring from the counsel that none have engaged 
former law minister S.M. Zafar, issued him notice to assist the 
court as amicus curiae (friend of the court). The court after 
consulting the parties decided that written statement by the 
respondent would be filed on or before Jan 17, 2000. The copies of 
that would be provided to the counsels of the petitioners 
immediately and after two weeks, the court would take up the matter 
for regular hearing on daily basis.

Mr Shah asked the court to halt proceedings against "Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif during the pendency of the constitutional petitions in 
the apex court." The Chief Justice inquired why the court should 
stay the proceedings of a totally different case. Mr Shah said if 
criminal proceedings before the ATC were not stayed by Jan 31, 2000 
everything would be topsy-turvy and the apex court proceedings 
might loose its relevance.

<a name="shau">Shaukat Aziz tells IMF: Economic programme to be home-grown</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Dec 4: Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz on Saturday said, 
the government held talks with the visiting IMF delegation on the 
broad economic policies and the macro-level issues.

"They have just come to understand thinking of the new team vis-a-
vis the economic policies of the government," he said while talking 
to newsmen here. "We did not discuss with them any new programme," 
he responded to a question.

"We told them the (economic) programme will be home-grown and they 
have supported it," the Minister said.

On the IPPs' issue, the Minister said, the government wants to 
resolve the issue in the best national interests. "Discussions and
negotiations with them are underway," he added.

Aziz informed that a team of HUBCO is coming next week and hoped 
that there will be progress on the issue.

Responding to a question, the Finance Minister said, the major 
thrust of the new economic policy will be on agriculture, poverty 
reduction and boosting investors' confidence.

The new economic policy is being prepared by the Economic Advisory 
Board in light of recommendations of its sub-groups, working on 
various sectors.

Asked about the thrust of the new policy, he said, we need to boost 
the investors' confidence. "The prime focus will be on the domestic 
inventors followed by the overseas Pakistanis and the foreign 
investors."

The other area of focus, in the new policy, will be agriculture 
which, he said, can be an engine of growth.

Similarly, Aziz said, the petroleum sector also has immense 
potential which is also linked with the on-going IPPs issue. Our 
dependence on imported oil can be reduced by developing the 
petroleum sector, he added.

He listed poverty reduction as another focal point of the new 
economic policy. We will use the available resources to ameliorate 
the plight of the common man, he added.

"We will make efforts to use the loans and funds in such projects 
which create jobs for the people thus helping them to overcome 
poverty," the Minister said.

To a question, the Minister said that the response to the voluntary 
exchange offer by the government on its existing euro bonds has 
been good.

As per the announcement of the government made earlier, the 
voluntary exchange offer by the Government of Pakistan for its 
existing bonds will expire on Dec 6, 1999 and the exchange is 
scheduled to close on December 13.-APP

During a recent inter-provincial meeting, held in the capital, the 
provinces had demanded increase in wheat quota at the rate of 160kg 
per capita against the existing quota of 146kg per capita.

The food ministry outrightly refused to meet the demand, saying the 
government had not enough financial resources for the purpose. If 
the ministry revised the quota the government would have to import 
3 million tons of wheat in addition to the current plan to import 
1.5 million tons of wheat in 1999-2000, the official said.

During the meeting, the provinces had been told by the ministry to 
check smuggling of wheat and flour, which was the only solution to 
artificial shortage of wheat in Sindh, Balochistan and the NWFP.-
NNI

 NWFP SITUATION: Meanwhile, NWFP Food Minister Abeedullah Jan asked 
the government to lift inter-provincial ban on movement of wheat 
and flour, saying that the province was not being provided 
sufficient wheat quota by thefederal food ministry to cater to its 
needs, adds APP.

Mr Jan listed major reasons for the shortfall of the commodity in 
the province, which also included the presence of 1.5 million (1.3 
million registered and 0.2 million un-registered) Afghan refugees.

Elaborating, he said:" We are getting wheat at a scale of 124 kg 
per head per annum from the food ministry. After grinding wheat, 
the scale further declined to 103 Kg per head per annum".

Of the total wheat supply,10 per cent was utilized for Maida, 5 per 
cent for brawn and 1.2% was wasted due to impurity, he added.

To a question, the minister said the present scale was not 
sufficient to meet the requirements of the province, where the 
commo-dity was consumed in larger quan-tity as compared to other 
pro-vinces.

<a name="fres">Fresh polls if assemblies not restored, says minister</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Dec 10: Minister for Local Bodies and Rural Development 
Omar Asghar said on Friday that fresh elections would be held if 
the national and provincial assemblies were not restored.

" The government has two options: either to restore the assemblies 
or to hold fresh elections," he said in an interview with IRNA.

"In case the assemblies are restored, the members having cases of 
wrongdoings, would have to be disqualified,if convicted by courts", 
he disclosed. Mr Asghar did not rule out general election in 2001, 
but said it would follow local bodies polls."However, any decision 
on these options would be made by the federal cabinet and the 
National Security Council", he added.

"Local bodies would provide the basis for a new leadership to 
emerge in the (ongoing) process," the minister said, making it 
clear that criminals and corrupt people would not be allowed to 
contest elections even at the local bodies level.

He said local bodies would be made so much powerful that they could 
not be dissolved at the whim of provincial governments. He said 
local councils would be made powerful and authorised even to levy 
taxes and explore their own resources.

Mr Asghar said the government intended to reform the electoral 
system, make the election commission more powerful, redemarcate 
constituencies and review the electoral roll. He added that the 
present administration was considering reforming the judicial 
system at the lower level,"so that the people get speedy justice".

He said: "Arbitration councils (Jirgas) would be set up at village 
level so that the people need not go to courts for the settlement 
of petty disputes."

He particularly mentioned tourism and trade as areas of great 
potential for bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and Iran. He 
stressed the need for joint efforts by the two brotherly countries 
to check smuggling of narcotics.

" We in Pakistan respect Iranian people and the change that has 
come in Iran after the revolution", he said, adding that the people 
and leadership in Pakistan drew inspiration from the spirit of 
"self-reliance " of the Iranian brothers.-NNI

<a name="10pa">10% Pakistanis consider Y2K bug fatal </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Dec 10: Only one-fourth of men and women in the urban 
areas of Pakistan have heard about the Y2K millennium bug and 10 
per cent of them believe that it can cause loss of life.

According to a recent survey by Gallup Pakistan, the awareness 
level in Pakistan is much lower than the global average which 
stands at 75 per cent.

The survey was part of a Gallup International poll conducted in 
more than 50 countries across the globe to mark the end of the 20th 
century. More than 50,000 statistically selected men and women were 
interviewed in the course of this study. The findings of this 
unique global study will be released in several parts by Gallup 
Pakistan.

Among those aware of the Y2K problem, 10 per cent in Pakistan 
believe that the Problem is so severe it may even cause loss of 
life. At the global level, 17 per cent hold this view.

HEALTH SECTOR: Pakistan officials and hospital staff fear the 
health sector will be the worst affected by the Y2K bug.

A health ministry spokesman said hospitals had the greatest 
concentration of hardware and software systems in the country.

Patients at health institutes may face "danger, stress or 
discomfort," he said, adding the problem may prolong treatment 
time, increase costs, give incorrect diagnosis."

The computer bug stems from a programming shortcut in which dates 
were abbreviated so years were given in just two digits.

That means older generation computers mistake the year 2000 for the 
year 1900. Experts say it may lead systems to crash or give 
erroneous data.

The millennium bug might harm or fail equipment used for life 
support, resuscitation, anaesthetic ventilators and neo-natal 
incubators, hospital sources said.

The ministry spokesman said a team of computer technicians had been 
set up to prepare a contingency plan to minimize potential problems 
in the health sector.

The government will use a 100,000-dollar World Bank grant to set up 
a task force to deal with the bug.

The task force has been given the job of computer control for the 
public sector including telecommunications, state-run banks, 
financial institutions, oil refineries, railways, civil aviation, 
shipping organizations and power plants.-app/afp

<a name="iran">Pakistan, Iran agree to remove irritants</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

TEHRAN, Dec 8: Pakistan and Iran here late on Wednesday agreed to 
endeavour for removing existing irritants in their relations. This 
was agreed at the hour-long formal talks held by Gen Pervez 
Musharraf and Seyyed Mohammad Khatami.

About the talks, foreign minister Abdus Sattar said, the two 
leaders held "frank and sincere talks." He said they agreed that 
both countries should jointly encourage Afghans to set up a "broad-
based representative and multi-ethnic government in the war-
shattered country."

The two leaders said that Six Plus Two besides US and Russian 
Federation should also help in establishing peace in Afghanistan.

General Musharraf on the occasion said, Pakistan attaches highest 
of importance to its close bilateral relations with Iran.

Pakistan Government, he said, is determined to further expand the 
mutually-beneficial cooperation with Iran in various fields, in 
particular to augment trade and economic collaboration.

The Chief Executive briefed the Iranian President of the latest 
situation in Kashmir. Both the sides also reiterated their 
commitment to the strengthening of regional peace and stability 
which is essential for the progress and prosperity of both the 
peoples.

Earlier, while talking to reporters on his arrival at Tehran 
airport, he told reporters that Pakistan wanted solution of Afghan 
crisis and modalities of setting up a broad-based government could 
figure during his talks with the top Iranian leadership.

On arrival, he was received by Iranian foreign minister Kamal 
Kharrazi and other officials.

To a question on Afghanistan, he said, he was conscious that views 
on Afghanistan being held by both Iran and Pakistan "have some 
irritants which need to be improved."

His government, he said, would endeavour to resolve such problems 
created by vested interest. Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Abdul 
Sattar held talks with his Iranian counterpart at Saadabad Palace 
complex.-APP

<a name="indi">India to buy 60,000 bales of Pakistani raw cotton</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

MULTAN, Dec 7: Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) vice chairman Masood 
Alam Rizvi has termed the response from the foreign cotton buyers 
as encouraging, as so far contracts of 149,000 cotton bales have 
been signed for export purposes.

Talking to newsmen here on Tuesday, he said so far India had 
emerged as the main buyer of Pakistan raw cotton as she had placed 
orders for as many as 60,000 cotton bales, while Indonesia and 
Bangladesh were other major customers of Pakistani raw cotton.

 Rizvi said Bangladesh had emerged a potential buyer of Pakistani 
agriculture produce as some 10,000 tons of onion had been exported 
to that country, out of the total onion export of 55,000 tons so 
far. He said an additional quantity of 20,000 tons of onion was 
likely to be exported to Bangladesh within a month. Besides, Rizvi 
continued, 10,000 tons of dry dates had also been exported to that 
fraternal country.

He said EPB had started negotiation with the management of Pakistan 
International Airlines (PIA) to provide as much facilities at 
Multan airport for the export of mangoes as possible. He added the 
outcome would be very positive.

Earlier, APBUMA chairman Khwaja Jalauddin Roomi placed a number of 
demands before the EPB vice chairman. Some of these are: (1) revise 
the present quota policy, specially its category 369FP-USA needed 
reconsideration as in its present form it is hampering APBUMA 

business; (2) exporters who surrendered their quotas falling under 
slow-moving categories be provided the same quota next year; (3) 
exporters who received quota in auction and utilized 75% of it be 
allowed to transfer their quota; (4) export be declared zero-rated 
and be exempted from sales tax.

Later, during a short question-answer session, businessmen 
complained that emerging buyers of Pakistani products were 
Bangladesh, Egypt, Sri Lanka and other countries of the same 
status, but National Bank often refused to entertain LCs of these 
countries which created a lot of problems both for the exporters 
and importers. EPB vice chairman said he would take the matter up 
with the governor State Bank.

<a name="dedu">Deduction of Zakat: Banks seek advice from State Bank</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 7: Five major banks have said they would have to 
accept the declarations filed by account holders of any of the 
recognized Fiqhs, including Fiqh-i-Hanafi, seeking exemption from 
compulsory deduction of Zakat. The term Fiqh means school of 
interpretation of Islamic laws.

The banks have clarified their position on the subject through a 
letter addressed to Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz and State Bank 
Governor Dr Ishrat Hussain. The banks are: (i) National Bank (ii) 
Habib Bank (iii) United Bank (iv) Muslim Commercial Bank and (v) 
Allied Bank.

The letter, written jointly and signed by senior officials of all 
the five banks, has asked the finance minister and the SBP governor 
to let them know by 12 noon on Wednesday (Dec 8) "whether the 
exemption from Zakat in compliance of the honourable Supreme Court 
dated 9-3-99 has been rightly made by the banks."

The banks have also sent a copy of the letter to the ministry of 
religious affairs seeking their advice by Wednesday noon.

The letter, drafted by the five banks, says they have clarified 
their position after obtaining legal advice from their lawyers on a 
recent advice on the subject originating from the ministry of 
religious affairs. The advice holds in abeyance implementation of 
the Supreme Court judgment of 9-3-99 on compulsory deduction of 
Zakat until the Federal Shariat Court gives its guidelines.

According to the Supreme Court judgment the exemption from 
compulsory deduction of Zakat was available to all the recognized 
Fiqhs (and not only to the Fiqh-i-Jafria) on filing the requisite 
affidavit. This advice originating from the ministry of religious 
affairs on Nov 26, 1999 was sent to the banks directly as well as 
through the State Bank. The advice created a confusion on whether 
the banks should go by the judgment of the Supreme Court and grant 
exemption from compulsory deduction of Zakat to clients of all 
Fiqhs or restrict themselves from granting this exemption to people 
of Fiqh-i-Jafria only as implied in the advice of the ministry of 
religious affairs.

"We are advised (by our lawyers) that in the absence of any review 
petition against the decision of the honourable Supreme Court on 
the part of the government or any stay order, non- compliance of 
the decision could amount to contempt of court," says the joint 
letter of the five major banks. "In view of the above we have to 
submit that all declarations filed by followers of all the 
recognized Fiqhs including Fiqh-i-Hanafi by the due date shall have 
to be accepted by banks for the purpose of exemption from 
collection of Zakat at source in the absence of any directive to 
the contrary."

Banks had asked their clients earlier to file declarations if they 
wanted their bankers not to deduct Zakat from their bank accounts 
on the 1st of Ramazan.

Senior bankers say the confusion created by the advice of the 
ministry of religious affairs scared bank clients on the one hand 
and on the other it forced the banks to adopt a wait and see 
position on Zakat deduction. 

They say if the ministry of religious affairs reviews its advice by 
Wednesday noon things may remain normal but if the ministry sticks 
to its position then there would be heavy withdrawals from bank 
accounts by the people who did not approve the idea of compulsory 
deduction of Zakat at source.

Ramazan is due to start either from Thursday or Friday subject to 
the appearance of moon.

<a name="hubc">Hubco not to hold talks on tariff </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Dec 10: Hub Power Company Limited (Hubco) will not engage 
in negotiations with Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) 
on issue of reduction in power tariff until the atmosphere of 
"coercion" against the power company was removed.

Talking to newsmen after signing Rs.1.250 billion stand-by Letter 
of Credit (LC) for import of furnace oil with UBL led five 
Pakistani banks in Karachi on Friday, Hubco Chief Executive 
Khursheed Hussain said that Hubco board of directors had decided 
that the company will not discuss reduction in power tariff with 
Wapda until allegations against the company were withdrawn. 
However, talks can be held to discuss the legality of the FIR 
registered against Hubco.

Mr Khursheed said during last meeting between the two sides in 
Lahore on December 7, Hubco did not discuss tariff issue. However, 
Wapda presented the company with a proposal on reduction of power 
tariff which was being studied.He said so far no date has been 
fixed for next meeting.

He said FIA officials deputed at the Hubco head-office in Karachi 
since December 7, 1999 have been withdrawn. However, the sealing of 
company's record was unfortunate.

He said Wapda was paying Rs.790 million per month to Hubco against 
the purchase of power which he said was not according to PPA signed 
by the two sides.

He said Hubco signed the stand-by LC of Rs.1.250 bn in favour of 
PSO for import of furnace oil with five Pakistani banks. Hubco pays 
about Rs.400m per month to PSO for import of furnace oil for the 
oil fired power plant of the company.

He said earlier Hubco used to open LC with internal banks like 
Citibank, ABN Amro Bank, ANZ Bank but it was first time that local 
banks had showed interest in a large transaction.

Earlier Hubco signed Rs.1.250bn stand-by LC in favour of PSO for 
import of furnace oil with UBL led consortium of five banks. The 
consortium comprised UBL (Rs. 450 million), Gulf Commercial Bank 
(Rs. 150 million), Prudential Bank (Rs. 100 million), Al-Faysal 
Islamic Bank (Rs. 300 million) and Bank Al-Falah (Rs. 250 
million).-PPI

<a name="move">Move to improve banks liquidity: SBP starts dollar rupee swap </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Dec 8: The State Bank has started providing rupees to the 
banks in exchange of US dollars as part of its contingency plan to 
overcome cash problems with banks after a possible rush on deposits 
provoked 
by Millennium Bug.

"As a part of the contingency plan to avoid any eventuality of Y2K 
millennium bug problem the State Bank will provide liquidity 
comfort to the banks," said a SBP announcement. "For this purpose 
SBP has decided to operate a USD/Rupee buy/sell swap window for the 
local inter-bank market from 8th December, 99 till year-end."

"Banks interested in availing of this facility can enter into swap 
agreements with the State Bank through this window during the 
normal banking hours," SBP said.

Millennium Bug as it is called is a possible error that may hit the 
computer networks at midnight between Dec 31, 1999 and Jan 1, 2000 
and make them go berserk and flush out wrong data. This in turn may 
cause problems in the entire outfit to which the computer network 
belongs.

All over the world central banks are anticipating a possible rush 
on bank deposits triggered by fears of the millennium bug even 
though banks across the globe including those in Pakistan have made 
themselves immune to the bug.

Senior bankers reached by Dawn said the State Bank purchased an 
estimated $13-$18 million from banks at Rs 51.75 per dollar under 
US dollar/rupee swap for up to Jan 14 on a premium of 25 paisa. 
This means that SBP would sell back the dollars it purchased from 
the banks on Dec 8, at Rs 52.00 per dollar on Jan 14, 2000.

SBP officials were not available to confirm the estimates of the 
swap volumes.

Bankers said the $13-$18 million dollar/rupee swap resulted into 
inflow of Rs 770-Rs 930 million into a cash-starved inter-bank 
money market. The State Bank said it would continue to buy dollars 
in future dates against rupees till year-end but it would not say 
whether all rupee/dollar swaps would be for Jan 14, 2000.

Senior bankers said SBP might also inject liquidity into the market 
through purchase of treasury bills at its operation market 
operation (OMO) due on Thursday.

SBP only said it would conduct a two-way OMO on Thursday that means 
that it can suck in or inject liquidity into the market on 
Thursday. But bankers think SBP would rather opt for injecting some 
liquidity into the cash-starved market instead of mopping up 
whatever is left. They said the market was so dry of cash that 
banks had to borrow Rs 12-14 billion from the State Bank against 
treasury bills and FIBs on Wednesday. They said the spell of the 
ongoing liquidity crunch kept overnight lending rates pegged at 
12.95 per cent.

Senior bankers said the State Bank could have relied only on direct 
injection of cash into inter-bank market to cope with any cash flow 
problem due to millennium bug. "But the reason why SBP has also 
started dollar/rupee swaps to address the same issue is that it 
would also help SBP build foreign exchange reserves," said country 
head of a foreign bank.

<a name="econ">Economic Advisory Board body proposes corporate farming</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rauf Klasra

ISLAMABAD, Dec 6: Sub-Group of Economic Advisory Board on 
Agriculture (SGA) has advised government to introduce corporate 
farming and shape required tax, prudential and legal regulations.

The SGA said land fragmentation is a major problem because it has 
resulted in inefficient use of farm inputs and low production and 
the only way to collect taxes from farm sector and enhance its 
production is to introduce corporate farming. The group has 
proposed that Cabinet Division must issue a notification 
immediately for the introduction of corporate farming policy and 
exempt the sector from any land holding.

The group added that Board of Investment (BOI) must engage 
international experts to organize joint ventures in agriculture 
sector.

According to a copy of recommendations, SGA has said land transfer 
to an agricultural corporation be exempted from land transfer fee, 
wealth tax and be treated an individual farmer. The State Bank need 
to rationalize policy and treat total financial requirements 
including purchase of land and all other inputs.

It said jagirs and jagirdari system has been abolished as per MLR64 
(land reforms of 1958). This should be implemented in case where it 
has not been and instead of it corporate and cooperative 
interventions must be encouraged.

These recommendations have been made part of economic revival 
package which the Economic Advisory Board (EAB) has finalized to be 
announced on December 15.

The group has also asked to bring large farmers of 50 acres and 
plus, under assessed direct tax while the rest may remain under 
prevalent presumptive tax. Small farmers under 12.5 acres be 
exempted from tax.

The group said all wealth tax on agriculture land may be abolished 
since it is a means of production and therefore, must be equated 
with industry.

Earlier, sub group on agriculture (SGA) held 6 meetings from 22 to 
27 November 1999. The group invited and heard views from entire 
spectrum of public and private sector institutions associated with 
the agriculture.

These recommendation are based on short and medium terms. In short 
term, group said it intends to do existing things in better and 
more efficiently manner. In medium term, it added new commercial 
institutions will be developed that will provide a better service 
to this sector.

The sub group said farm sector is both service and capital starved 
and lacks formal commercial structures. This sector can in short 
term bring about a growth rate of 4 to 5 per cent. The government 
has been requested to prioritized its resource allocation. Some of 
the salient recommendations of the group:

Credit: The SGA recommended that commercial credit to agriculture 
sector must be provided on need-basis rather than yearly 
allocations. Around Rs100 billion is required for it. Commercial 
banks may join in setting up a agriculture credit support service 
company that will work at grassroots level.

<a name="maye">Pakistan may extend Eurobond exchange offer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Dec 6: Pakistan might extend for two more weeks an offer 
to exchange three of its Eurobonds for a new bond in a bid to woo 
bondholders who have not accepted the offer, bankers and financial 
sources said on Monday.

The offer was originally to have ended on Monday, and bankers said 
there were indications investors holding more than 80% of the three 
bonds had taken up the offer. Some $375 million worth of the bonds 
are held by Pakistani banks which had already accepted the offer.

'The government intends to give another chance to holders who have 
not accepted the offer. The government has made it clear that it 
does not want to default or force the holders,' a financial source 
who asked not to be identified said.

Pakistan last month made an unprecedented offer to exchange three 
of its Eurobonds worth a total of $610 million for longer-dated new 
paper.

The source said a government announcement extending the offer and 
giving other details should be expected on Tuesday or Wednesday.

The offer, launched on November 15, applies to three issues: $150 
million 11.5 percent notes due 1999, $160 million six per cent 
exchangeable notes due 2002 and $300 million floating rate notes 
due 2000.

The offer officially closed on Monday, but bankers said effectively 
the deal expired on Thursday as Euroclear needs two days to process 
any new issue.

The original offer provided for the new issue to start trading on 
Dec 13.

The new paper is a six-year bond carrying a 10% coupon payable 
semi-annually in June and December. The principal payment will be 
made in four instalments starting from December 2002 and ending in 
December 2005.

'The general consensus that we have from the bond markets is that 
if any offer has been accepted by 75% of the holders, the rest 
should follow,' said Jahanzeb Naseer, head of research at brokers 
Jardine Fleming Pakistan.

But Naseer said Finance Ministry officials had informally indicated 
that Pakistan might extend the offer as it does not want to be seen 
to be forcing holders to accept the offer.

One of the reasons for avoiding a forced rescheduling is 
government's repeated commitment that its top priorities include 
renewal of investor confidence to attract the much-needed foreign 
inflows.

<a name="divi">Dividend payouts up on excess reserves tax</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Haris Anwar

KARACHI, Dec 9: The listed companies have started to cough up more 
money in dividend payouts to the shareholders to avoid a tax 
introduced in this fiscal year.

The corporate announcements being made during the last three months 
or more have been showing a higher dividend payout trend despite 
the dismal market conditions.

"We are observing handsome dividends from the companies in our 
portfolio," said an official at the National Investment Trust 
(NIT), a state-run mutual fund, which manages portfolio of 67 
listed companies.

Aware of the public demand that profitable companies should pay 
reasonable cash dividends, the previous government had imposed a 10 
per cent tax on the companies' reserves in excess of 50 per cent of 
their paid-up capital if they did not distribute at least 40 per 
cent of their post-tax profits.

"By and large this measure is forcing the profitable companies to 
pay more in the dividends," said Shahid Ghaffar, Managing Director 
of Karachi Stock Exchange, while referring to some companies which 
paid in cash dividends more than they did last year.

The NIT has short-listed 33 companies from its portfolio, which 
will have to pay additional payouts on their 1998 earnings. It is 
expecting about Rs 34 million additional dividends on their 1998 
earnings, as the law is made retrospective, covering those 
companies which had announced their results after June 1998.

"Most companies have already announced additional payouts to avoid 
this tax on their 1998 earnings," a high official at the NIT said.

The extra dividends from such companies on the 1999 earnings, when 
more companies come under the law, were expected to touch about Rs 
62 million, he said.

According to the Karachi Stock Exchange's recent report, out of 382 
companies which showed profit during 1998 only 266 declared 
dividends.

Some executives, who are not happy with the law, said well-managed 
companies already paying prudent amount in dividends as well as 
building reserves were suffering the most as their profits were 
taxed more than once. "This tax is also in contradiction to the 
global trend of return on cash flows and it would result in less 
equity and more borrowing for the companies paying good dividends 
and building their reserves as well," said one of the executives. 
Another executive at a multinational company maintained that 
companies' affairs should not be regulated by fiscal measures. "I 
think companies should be governed by the directors who are 
answerable to the shareholders and the corporate watchdog," said 
the executive who did not wish to be named. But Arif Habib, newly-
elected president of the Karachi Stock Exchange, says the Pakistani 
market cannot be compared with the developed markets. "In Pakistan 
equity investment has received a severe beating and the investors' 
confidence is at the lowest ebb. But because of this measure we are 
seeing good payouts, which will definitely improve the market 
conditions," he said.

"I think this law should be in place for a year or so to improve 
the market dividend yield and then it can be reviewed," he added.

According to one source, the recently formed committee on the 
capital market has also forwarded a similar recommendation to the 
Economic Advisory Board, which is tasked to prepare the new 
government's economic agenda. "There was consensus among the 
committee members that the current law should be there for a 
limited time to correct the poor corporate governance and lack of 
historical payouts by a large number of listed companies," said one 
of the body members.

The law was specifically designed to target the textile and sugar 
companies which have a very poor dividend payout history. Analysts 
said investors should expect more good payouts by Feb-March next 
year when most textile and sugar companies would announce their 
results.

But some stock analysts say the market is not responding to the 
excellent corporate announcements made during the last few weeks, 
which is a rare phenomenon to experience.

"It seems the market players are not willing to commit funds until 
some real recovery in the weak industrial sector of the economy is 
in sight," said one expert.

<a name="stoc">Stocks remain bullish on foreign buying</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 9: Stocks on Thursday remained in bullish frame of 
mind as foreign-led buying was not inclined to take even a 
technical breather amid predictions of a sustained bull-run in the 
sessions to come. The KSE index finished with an added gain of 
22.42 points or 1.6% at 1,355.59.

'It now appears pretty sure that bulls led by some leading foreign 
funds are out to push the index to 1,400.00 points and then plan 
the future strategy', said a leading stock analyst.

'There is nothing special in the background news to which the 
current investor optimism about the bullish outlook could be 
attributed expecting perceptions of economic recovery, rescheduling 
of foreign loans and the broader acceptance of the new regimes by 
some leading foreign powers, he added.

But some others said, brokers are attaching much importance to the 
new economic guidelines to put the economy back on the rails 
expected to be announced on Dec 15 and are making extensive buying 
on the sectors which could be the chief beneficiary of the new 
policy.

Heavy buying in the oil marketing giant and some other energy 
shares, on reports of another price hike of 10% in the petroleum 
prices was said to be another supporting factor generating a good 
bit of speculative buying in PSO and Shell Pakistan.

Speculative buying was there but the important development was a 
good number of genuine investors were in the rings and made active 
short-covering in the undervalued shares, notably in the textile 
sector.

The KSE 100-share posted a fresh gain of 22.42 points or 1.68% at 
1,355.59 as compared to 1,333.17 a day earlier.

The market capitalization added another Rs5bn to the overnight 
total at Rs363bn as compared to Rs358bn a day earlier.

It has gained about 100 points or 7.5% during the last one week as 
perception of a bull market followed by news of economic recovery 
and resumption of dried up aid pipeline lured foreign investors 
back in the rings.

'It is not a single factor but a combination of positive factors, 
which continued to inspire strong buying even at the higher levels, 
heralding the advent of foreign buying', analysts said.

All have turned buyers overnight driving bears out of the market as 
the financial institutions continued to pump massive funds in the 
pivotals even at the prohibiting higher levels.

Big gainers were led by Engro Chemical, Shell Pakistan, Knoll 
Pharma, Suraj Cotton and Cherat Papersack, which posted gains 
ranging from Rs6.00 to Rs10.00, Engro Chemical and Shell being the 
star performer on heavy buying aided by news of higher dividend and 
news of increase in POL Prices.

Other good gainers included MCB,Sapphire Fabrics,Lever Brothers, 
Crescent Textiles,Mari Gas,National Refinery, and Adamjee 
Insurance,rising by Rs.1.50 to 3.00.

Losers were led by Packages, Dawood Hercules, Century Paper and 
Grays Leasing,BOC Pakistan and Clariant Pakistan, falling by 
Rs.1.45 to 5.00.

Trading volume fell to 189m shares from the previous 204m shares as 
the trading was closed 2.15 hour before the official closing time 
at 2 p.m. as compared to 4.15 p.m. to allow the brokerage houses to 
square their positions and settle accounts.but gainers maintained a 
strong lead over the losers at 134 to 72,with 52 holding on to 
their last levels.

PTCL topped the list of most actives,up 40 paisa at Rs.22.30 on 50m 
shares followed by Hub-Power, unchanged at Rs21.20 on 33m shares, 
PSO, up Rs3.40 at Rs164.70 on 15m shares, ICI Pakistan, firm five 
paisa at Rs10.25 on 13m shares, Sui Northern, up 20 paisa at 
Rs11.50 on 11m shares, Fauji Fertiliser, higher 90 paisa at Rs51.10 
on 11m shares, Engro Chemical higher Rs9.80 at Rs137.30 on 6m 
shares.

Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, 
higher 45 paisa on 8m shares, Followed by Nishat Mills, up Rs1.10 
on 6m shares, Adamjee Insurance, up Rs1.45 on 5m shares, KESC, firm 
by 10 paisa on 3.246m shares, Bank of Punjab, steady by 10 paisa on 
2.580m shares and Askari Bank, up 65 paisa on 2.437m shares.

DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Shares of eight companies came in for trading 
under the lead of Mian Textiles, which was marked up by one rupee 
on 41,000 shares followed by Suzuki Motorcycle, higher 50 paisa on

<a name="thec">The Clifton Boating Basin</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

A YEAR and a half ago, in my column printed on July 27, 1997, I 
wrote on just one of the mammoth land scams to which the city of 
Karachi has been subjected:

"In August 1996, in the centre of Karachi, a lake and its 
peripheral park, together admeasuring 246 acres and notified as a 
public amenity area, was surreptitiously and illegally 
commercialized, and an agreement was signed to lease it out to a 
developer for him to thereupon build commercial property for 
pecuniary gain.

"Is there anyone in this land of ours who is prepared to believe 
that this could have been done without the tacit approval or active 
connivance of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her Chairman of the 
Environment Protection Agency doubling as her Minister of 

Investment, Asif Zardari, her now absconding Chief Minister in 
Sindh, Abdullah Shah, his now absent adviser, 'Tony Casino', and 
all their concerned ministers and official abettors?

"And, is there anyone who could believe that such an agreement 
could have been made without a lot of money changing hands under 
the table ?

"We go back twentyfive years. Under instructions from President 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, his faithful Minister for Housing, Town 
Planning and Local Government in Sindh, the inimical Jam Sadiq Ali, 
had a scheme prepared for the development of the Clifton area of 
Karachi, and this then well planned area notified as Kahkashan, KDA 
Scheme 5, Clifton, was born. On December 6, 1972, the President 
approved the plan for implementation, whereafter, from 'Day One', 
all those empowered with 'discretion' to amend or change or relax 
rules and regulations, have so done, with impunity and regularity, 
for their own nefarious gain.

"Amenity Block No.6, admeasuring 246 acres of the notified Scheme 
5, comprises a seawater lake of 192 acres and a peripheral park 
area of 54 acres. This tidal lake, a portion of the eastern 
backwater of the port, within the jurisdiction of the Karachi Port 
Trust, is also known as 'The Boating Basin'. A stone embankment was 
constructed to contain the water, and the fenced in area was handed 
over by the lessors, the KDA, to the KMC for development.

"Come the third PPP government, and in August 1994 it was decided 
to develop ponds for performing dolphins and seals and to build and 
operate an amusement park on 10 acres of the 246-acre area. 
International offers were invited. The only offer received was from 
the firm of Marine Animal Productions (MAP) in Gulfport, 
Mississippi, USA. The firm's professionals came to Karachi, 
discussed the project, and on March 28, 1995, a letter of intent 
was issued by the KMC informing MAP that they had been selected and 
that the KMC would negotiate with them exclusively. 'Terms of 
reference and guidelines' were formulated by the Parks Department 
and approved by the Legal Department of the KMC, envisaging the 
licensing of 5 acres of land and 5 acres of water to the licensees.

"Then came the marauders. The MAP was sidelined without assigning 
any reason, the terms of reference were shelved. In June 1995, the 
project was taken over by the KMC Engineering Department and the 
Chief Engineer advertised in Jang on the 25th of that month 
announcing that : 'In compliance with Prime Minister Mohtarma 
Benazir Bhutto's Karachi Socio-Economic Package' public offers were 
invited to build, own and operate 'A dolphin park and sea-sports 
complex at Boating Basin, Clifton - the Diamond District of 
Karachi.'

"Six local builders, developers, entrepreneurs submitted offers and 
the KMC selected developers Dolmen (Pvt) Ltd. After negotiations, 
the KMC Administrator Anzar Zaidi signed an agreement on August 19, 
1996, with Dolmen's Managing Director Nadeem Riaz, son of Feroz 
Gittoo. The agreement, inter alia , envisages the leasing out to 
Dolmen all of the 246 acres for a period of 30 years and enables 
the KMC to 'consider to extend the lease for such period and on 
such reasonable terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed' 
between the two parties. It also permits Dolmen to construct on 34 
per cent of the total land and water area 'buildings and structures 
of all kinds relating to the components defined in Clause 1 of the 
Agreement.' The 'components' include administration/office blocks, 
amphitheatres, exhibition centres (shops?), food outlets (shops?), 
merchandizing outlets (shops), games and other outlets, bowling 
alleys, billiard rooms, etc. It also envisages that 'the components 
shall, where appropriate, be updated and improved from time to time 
under intimation to KMC.' Of note are the words 'shall' and 
'intimation'. No prior approval of the KMC is necessary.

"Thus, Dolmen is virtually entitled to build and lease out a string 
of commercial complexes over an area of 84 acres (406,560 sq yds) 
of real estate now conservatively estimated to be worth some Rs. 25 
billion.

"In return, Dolmen is expected to provide recreational facilities 
and will be responsible for 'the diversion of sewerage from Nahr-e-
Khayyam and the inlets from Chinna Creek.' It will pay to the KMC, 
by way of royalty, five per cent of the fees charged for entrance 
to the amusement park, with a minimum of Rs.5 per person. The lease 
rental for the total area has been fixed at Paisas 50 per square 
foot per annum (which with 'exemptions', totals Rs. 1,176,120 for 
the first year), compoundingly increasing by 15 per cent per annum,

"Come this government, come Federal Nawaz and Provincial Liaquat 
Jatoi, and instead of cancelling and nullifying the disastrous 
agreement, they authorized the execution of a lease deed which was 
executed on February 23, 1997, by the Land Department of the KMC. 
However, the Diamond District can still be saved. Neither has the 
'The Master Plan' submitted by Dolmen on May 22, 1997, been 
approved by the KMC, nor has physical possession of the area been 
handed over to Dolmen.

"Block 6 is not the only block in the Diamond District that is 
being savagely desecrated. For reasons that no one can 
satisfactorily explain, the planning and building control 
jurisdiction of Blocks 8 and 9 have been handed over to the Clifton 
Cantonment Board. KDA, the lessor of these areas, maintains that 
plots 5 and 6 (between 'Yusuf Grand Square' and the PBS petrol 
pump) in Block 8, on the main Clifton Road, have not been legally 
and properly converted from residential to commercial plots, but 
complains that the CCB has approved plans for commercial highrises 
now being constructed thereon. Booking offices have opened - in 
Yousuf Grand Square for plot 5, and in the 'CTC Continental Trade 
Centre' for plot 6.

"Similarly, residential plot G-7, in Block No 9 (on the corner of 
the main Clifton Road at the very busy road junction next to the 
Two Talwar roundabout) has not been legally commercialized but the 
CCB has allowed thereon the construction of 'The Plaza', a complex 
of 150 shops and 130 offices......."

On July 29 1997, the matter of the Boating Basin having been 
brought to the attention of the then Additional Chief Secretary of 
Sindh, Ahmed Maqsood Hameedee, he addressed the following letter to 
me :

"In response to your letter of 27.7.97 I have to inform you that 
the necessary instructions have been issued to the KMC to cancel 
the lease and to nullify the transaction.

"The status of the plot (246 acres) remains unchanged. The area 
will remain as it is, as originally planned, as an amenity to be 
freely enjoyed by the people of Karachi."

No action was ever taken by the KMC. Mr Hameedee's instructions 
were ignored. Now, at the end of 1999, Anzar Zaidi, the KMC 
administrator, who signed the agreement with Dolmen in 1996 (an agreement
heavily weighted in Dolmen's favour), is the provincial 
secretary HTP, in charge of the KMC. Should he be in that position?

Fahim Zaman, the KMC administrator when the scam was conceived in 
1994, the man said to be the brains behind the entire dubious deal, 
is now back in the same post. Should he be where he is?

As for the Karachi Port Trust, it should immediate claim back the 
portion of the eastern backwater lost to it by the misdoings of 
those in positions of power.

Over to NAB, to suitably deal with former prime minister Benazir 
Bhutto, former environmental champion Asif Zardari, former chief 
minister of Sindh, Abdullah Shah, former KPT chairman Rear Admiral 
Akbar Hussain Khan, and all the other dedicated servants of the 
people responsible for the Clifton Boating Basin scam.

<a name="thed">The distinct sound of floundering </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

IF a bystander, his curiosity aroused by a strange sound, were to 
put his ears to the ground, chances are he would hear a stricken 
creature thrashing its arms about in an attempt to keep its head 
above water.
 
Not to put too fine a point on it, this creature is the reformist 
government of General Pervez Musharraf, its elan already a bit 
withered and lost as it tries to fashion a coherent agenda from the 
rhetoric with which it has been trying to justify its assumption of 
power. There is certainly no dramatic turnaround in sympathy for 
Nawaz Sharif and his leading companions who now face the rough end 
of justice. But public memories being short, Nawaz Sharif's massive 
failings are being obscured and softened as time passes.

Forget about the drawing room classes who preach high-minded reform 
and practise a different morality. Consider instead the mood of 
ordinary people for whom the hijacking case is not the obsessive 
thing that it might be for the army command. What has military rule 
meant for them? Prices have not fallen, new jobs have not been 
created and the administrative juggernaut (thana, tehsil, kutchery) 
is as rickety and corrupt as before. So much for the army's 
monitoring system.

Earnest men in starched khaki, their collars and peak caps ablaze 
with red tabs, will of course bristle at these suggestions. In 
imperious undertones they can almost be heard saying, 'what do you 
expect in such a short time?' While they have a point they forget 
the rueful line that even a week is a long time in politics. And 
this regime has been around for nearly two months without much to 
show for itself.

True, a small herd of fattened cattle victims has been brought 
before the altar of accountability. But the voyeuristic delight 
provided by this spectacle has already palled. As it was bound to 
happen unless a constant stream of sacrificial victims was produced 
to feed the public's appetite for this kind of drama, a piece of 
psychology the Roman emperors understood only too well. With no 
addition to this herd, and no public quartering either, the 
spectators in what can be described as our national arena are 
beginning to feel cheated.

But by far more momentous is the regime's failure to set a clear 
course for itself. Where does it want to go? What is the holy grail 
it seeks? Good intentions abound but having heard too many of these 
in the past this is one thing the people of Pakistan are wary of.

Pressed for answers, the Chief Executive, who is giving more press 
interviews than is good for him, falls back upon a clutch of well-
rehearsed lines: he wants to remove inter-provincial disharmony, 
revive the economy and devolve power to the provinces, and from 
there to the districts. For good measure, every now and then a shot 
is fired across the bows of 'sham' democracy. But a crucial 
question remains unanswered. If in over a year the army has not 
managed to reform WAPDA, on what grounds of faith does it expect 
people to believe that over a similar or longer time span it can 
reform the nation?

A word too about another myth currently being flogged to death: 
devolution. Quite apart from the fact that devolution of any sort 
and military rule are a contradiction in terms, no one has 
precisely defined what kind of devolution the Chief Executive has 
in mind. The impression being spread, however, is that when this 
still undefined concept acquires shape, 'real' democracy will 
arrive, bringing in its wake genuine 'empowerment', for the first 
time in their history, to the people of Pakistan.

No one need be under any illusion that the steel-frame of the 
central administrative structure is going to be dismantled any time 
soon or that with the coming of the new millennium deputy 
commissioners and superintendents of police will disappear into the 
shades. Devolution of power is just a fancy name being given to the 
concept of local bodies. Even when they come into existence (when 
precisely only the oracles can say), power will remain where it has 
always been: in the steel-frame of the administrative structure 
which - even more than railways, caramel custard and the English 
language - is the most enduring legacy of Queen Victoria's Empire.

Even in climes more salubrious than ours, local bodies are vehicles 
for delivering better municipal services. Nowhere - not in the US, 
Britain, France or Germany - are they a substitute for national 
democracy. While Pakistan can do with better garbage disposal, its 
foremost problem is finding better leadership and reducing the 
corruption, waywardness and lack of vision of its governing class, 
of which, as should be obvious, the military is also a part. This 
is a long-term process and not a trick which can be performed by 
pulling a switch. In any event, how will local elections a year or 
so hence address this problem? Or does GHQ think that by merely 
stepping into the ring and seizing power this problem stands 
resolved?

All this is very confusing but, on examination, hardly surprising. 
This is a regime born in the midst of confusion, its leading lights 
themselves admitting that on October 12, in response to the action 
taken by the prime minister, they had to act on the spur of the 
moment. So the 111 Brigade, which is to us what the Praetorian 
Guard was for the Roman Empire and the Janissaries for the 
Ottomans, was sent in and after a bit of confusion at the TV 
station, confusion being the hallmark of these events, power was 
seized, the prime minister and his colleagues arrested and the 
Constitution, that raddled document abused so often in our history, 
thrown into the dark once again.

Since dislodging a civilian government in Pakistan takes about as 
much time as fixing a complicated tyre puncture, sending Nawaz 
Sharif to the cleaners was the easy part. Creating some order out 
of the chaos of Pakistan's problems is more difficult. In coming to 
grips with this task the senior officers who removed Nawaz Sharif 
with so much aplomb look decidedly less sure of themselves.

It is scarcely surprising, therefore, if what the nation is being 
treated to is a roll-call of dismal events: uninspired 
appointments, the hollow clang of good intentions and the swiftness 
of a pair of oxen making their way up a steep mountain. Even after 
two months the overriding impression is of an army trying to 
improvize on the march.

This augurs ill for the future. Unlike a democratic government 
whose very legitimacy puts it under no desperate necessity to prove 
itself all the time, a government outside the constitutional pale 
has to justify itself by its performance. If it falters on this 
count it forfeits all reason to exist. General Pervez Musharraf's 
government, therefore, is under pressure to deliver. The question 
is, can it do so?

As if other problems were not enough, there is another theoretical 
knot which remains to be untangled. The army command's whole case 
for removing Nawaz Sharif is built on a single premise: that by 
removing General Musharraf as he flew home from Colombo and 
installing Lt-Gen Ziauddin in his place, Nawaz Sharif was sowing 
the seeds of factionalism in the army. His removal, therefore, had 
become necessary. Fine. But what justifies suspending the 
Constitution and banishing democracy? Between the premise and the 
conclusions we are seeing there is no logical connection.

If, however, the wider charge against Nawaz Sharif is that he was 
arbitrary in his ways and increasingly contemptuous of the 
institutional diversity of the state (a true enough accusation, by 
the way), how are matters helped by a retreat to militarism, a 
state of mind whose ruling principle is ad-hocism and the exercise 
of unquestioned authority? One can go on arguing like this till the 
moon rises but to no avail because in Pakistan today even 
elementary logic is open to abuse and imperial disdain.

<a name="goth">Gothic horror story</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

IT took a letter from the murderer to a newspaper and the police to 
uncover the most horrifying crime in Pakistan's history. The brutal 
killing of a hundred boys in Lahore by a psychopath and his gang 
has shocked a nation that has seen more than its share of horror.

More than the crime itself, it is the fact that a hundred children 
could disappear from their homes in and around Lahore without the 
authorities being aware of it is a cause of so much anguish and 
anger. For months, the self-confessed murderer, Javed Iqbal, and 
his accomplices preyed on the boys at public places like Heera 
Mandi and Data Darbar, luring them to his home on Ravi Road with 
promises of money and video movies. There the boys would be 
sodomised, murdered, chopped up and then thrown into vats of acid. 
Meticulously, their clothes and shoes would be tagged and stored.

The only reason this killing spree has come to an end is no thanks 
to the police: after he had killed a hundred victims, the murderer 
reached the target he had set himself, and wrote to the police and 
a newspaper. The police officer who first received the letter 
apparently consigned it to the rubbish bin, and news reporters 
reached the scene of the crime before the cops did. Had Javed Iqbal 
decided he would kill five hundred children, I have little doubt he 
would still be at his gruesome task, unhindered by the minions of 
the law.

This gothic horror story has many lessons for our society, lessons 
I am sure we will conveniently forget as soon as the initial shock 
has worn off. As long as our immediate family is all right, we are 
quite happy to close our eyes to what is happening around us. We 
forget that sooner or later, the ills of society will enter through 
our front door and ultimately, nobody is exempt from crime and 
criminals.

Even after the case had been handed to the police on a platter, the 
best they could do was to carelessly lose an alleged accomplice of 
the killer. Apparently, he managed to commit suicide while being 
interrogated by jumping through a second floor window. This is such 
a common occurrence that by now one would imagine the police could 
have thought of a better cover-up for death in custody. 
Transferring the DIG and the SSP after the event is a bit like 
shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.

The sad fact is that despite endless talk of police reforms, our 
police force remains as mired in inefficiency and corruption as 
ever. The reason so many parents did not report their sons as 
missing is that they were afraid of having anything to do with the 
police. Indeed, the experience of the vast majority who are forced 
to come into contact with our cops is anything but salutary; nine 
times out of ten, they are shaken down even when reporting a crime. 
But to be fair, this is true for most branches of the executive.

The crime took place in a very heavily populated area of Lahore. It 
is inconceivable that Javed Iqbal's neighbours did not see scores 
of young boys coming to the house, or hear any sounds, or smell the 
stench of human flesh being consumed by acid. And yet nobody 
reported anything out of the ordinary. One reason could well be 
that Javed Iqbal pretended to be a police officer and 
understandably, the neighbours did not want to antagonize him. This 
again says something about the fear the police inspire among 
ordinary people.

Every time we are hit by a natural or man-made calamity, an inquiry 
committee is set up. Its main purpose is to deflect public anger, 
give the impression that the government is doing something and to 
cover up the facts if they might embarrass the administration. The 
Javed Iqbal case has proved no different. The committee is going 
through the motions, and will one day, no doubt, produce a report 
that will gather dust in some cubby-hole in the Punjab Secretariat. 
Apart from a few transfers, the police officials concerned will 
remain unscathed and it will be business as usual until the next 
horror.

What has to happen before a radical police reform is finally 
carried out? For years now there has been talk of a metropolitan 
system to replace the archaic, colonial set-up that has been 
discarded everywhere else. Not that this is any guarantee of an 
improvement: after all, the same cops would be manning any new 
system. But anything would be an improvement over what we have now. 
Although powerful vested interests have resisted reform tooth and 
nail, one hopes the new administration will not shy away from the 
tough decisions that are needed.

When two schoolboys went on a shooting spree in their school in a 
small American town, President Clinton flew in to console the 
victims' families and to pray with the survivors. In view of the 
magnitude of the crime, surely General Musharraf could have made a 
similar gesture. Apart from the public relations value of such a 
step, it would have shown the bereaved families that this 
administration shared their loss. Such a sentiment cannot be 
adequately expressed through a formal message that appears in the 
inner pages of the newspapers.

The whole macabre case underlines the terrible sexual frustration 
and perversion that lie just below the surface of our hypocritical 
society. The abuse of young boys is an unspoken but rampant aspect 
of everyday life here and sodomy is the dark - but all too common - 
side of sexuality here. This is one result of the gender 
segregation prevalent in traditional societies like ours that 
nobody wants to talk about. While pretending that ours is a 
community undefiled by sexual promiscuity, the facts are very 
different and often very ugly.

What happened on such a staggering magnitude in Lahore recently 
occurs daily on a smaller scale elsewhere without outraged 
editorials being written or inquiry committees being formed. We are 
simply not prepared to concede that sexual frustration regularly 
leads to deviant acts among both sexes. Indeed, the whole subject 
is practically taboo: very little scholarly work has been done in 

this area, and journalists tend to tread warily around the whole 
question.

But until we are willing to face the consequences of rigid sexual 
segregation, the violation of young boys and its attendant violence 
will continue to haunt us.

<a name="iccc">ICC confirms: Shoaib's bowling action under scrutiny</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec 9: The International Cricket Council (ICC) has 
confirmed to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that speed merchant 
Shoaib Akhtar's bowling action is under scrutiny.

However, the ICC has not barred the player from selection in the 
Australia-bound Pakistan team for the tri-nation series starting 
from Jan 9.

ICC's Manager Cricket Operations, Clive Hitchcock, in a Dec 2 
letter, has informed the PCB that the game's governing body has 
received a report from Match Referee, John Reid, and supported by 
two umpires Darrell Hair and Peter Willey.

"A report has been received from the ICC referee in Australia Mr 
John Reid which has expressed concern about the bowling action of 
Shoaib Akhtar.

"The report is supported by National Grid panel umpires Darrell 
Hair and Peter Willey," Hitchcock writes in the letter.

Hair and Willey stood in the Perth Test which Pakistan lost by an 
innings and 20 runs to end a disastrous first half of the 
Australian tour. Interestingly, no objection has been made by the 
other three umpires - Daryll Harper (Australia), Eddie Nicholls 
(West Indies), Peter Parker (Australia) - who stood in the first 
two Tests. Willey also supervised the Hobart Test which Pakistan 
lost by four wickets.

Hair has a history of doubting bowlers bowling action. He called 
Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan seven times in the 
Melbourne Test during the 1995-96 series. 

When Shoaib made his debut in 1997-98 against the West Indies, 
Raman Subba Row was the match referee while against South Africa in 
South Africa, Peter Burge was the match referee. Cammie Smith was 
the match referee in the series against India in India earlier this 
year.

Shoaib Akhtar is the second Pakistan pacer whose bowling action has 
been referred to the ICC technical committee on illegal deliveries 
for clearance. Shabbir Ahmad was pulled out in October from the 
Australia tour after being selected.

While Shabbir was asked to the withdrawn from the team by the ICC, 
no such condition has been laid in the case of Shoaib Akhtar.
