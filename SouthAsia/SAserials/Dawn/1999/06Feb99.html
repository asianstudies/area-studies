<a name="nawa">Nawaz visits LoC: Support to Kashmiris' struggle reaffirmed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KEIL BORDER (Azad Kashmir), Feb 5: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said 
on Friday that Pakistan is a peace loving country but it is also 
not oblivious to its defence.
    
He said, Pakistan has always tried to solve all the differences 
with India through peaceful means and that is why he made a 
dialogue offer to India soon after coming into power.
    
Speaking on the Solidarity Day with Kashmiris, the prime minister 
at an Army Darbar at Keil Border, which is surrounded by snow-
covered mountains, said that "Pakistan fully believes in truth of 
his motive and we have also suggested for international mediation 
on Kashmir. But India showed arrogance on it."
    
He said "India knows that it can not face any mediation on the 
issue as its stance is based on arrogance."
    
Nawaz Sharif said, "today Kashmiri people are rightly asking all 
the civilised nations of the world that why this issue is still 
included in the unresolved issues on UN list.
    
"We do not have a mere geographical link with Kashmir rather we 
have a relation of blood and ideology and above all we are tied in 
the bonds of humanity," he said.
    
Nawaz said, "we consider it our responsibility to raise voice 
against brutalities committed in this part of the world where 
people are being deprived of their rights."
    
Nawaz Sharif while lauding armed forces' contribution in 
eradication of social evils from the society said, both government 
and army were waging Jihad against these evils and weaknesses.
    
He said, the masses wanted the solution of their problems, 
provision of speedy justice and elimination of terrorism and 
corruption.
    
While paying tributes to the armed forces he said, "today, with the 
grace of Allah Almighty, not only Pakistan but the Ummah is proud 
of our forces."
    
He said, "Pakistan is an atomic power and your spirits are much 
higher than before.
    
"We are not only an atomic power but Ghauri and Shaheen missiles 
are also an evidence of our impregnable defence in the world," the 
premier added.
    
Nawaz Sharif told the Jawans that government was not "unaware of 
the needs of soldiers like you. The way in which you are defending 
the frontiers of your motherland is a matter of pride for the 
nation." The prime minister said, "you are performing duties on 
such a height and braving the hardships of weather, which is a 
matter of satisfaction for the entire nation."
    
Earlier, on arrival here the prime minister was received by Chief 
of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf, Corps Commander of the area 
and former AJK prime minister Sardar Abdul Qayyum Khan.
    
PUBLIC MEETING: Later, the prime minister arrived in Kotli where he 
addressed a public meeting. He told his audience that it was an 
acknowledged fact that freedom fighters cannot be kept subjugated 
for ever.
    
"People of Kashmir have resolved to get their right to self- 
determination, this is why they have been waging a relentless 
struggle and offering immense sacrifices, and time has come for 
India to give them their inherent right."
    
He said, freedom cannot be denied to Kashmiris for ever. "If not 
today, they are going to get it tomorrow."
    
The prime minister said, "Kashmir is not a matter of geography, it 
is a matter of bonds of blood and ideology."
    
He was flanked on the dais by Azad Kashmir premier Barrister Sultan 
Mahmood Chaudhry and leaders of all political parties of Azad 
Kashmir, and representative of the All Parties Hurriyet Conference 
(APHC); federal ministers Sartaj Aziz, Lt Gen (retd) Abdul Majid 
Malik, Raja Zafarul Haq, Senators Pervez Rasheed and Akram Zaki, 
besides parliamentarians and notables.
    
He said, it was not possible for the enemy to declare war on 
Pakistan.
    
Pakistan, he said, not only was a nuclear power, but it had masses 
who were determined to protect every inch of the motherland. "So an 
adventurist will have to think twice before confronting Pakistan," 
he added.
    
He referred to the slogan 'Kashmir Baneyga Pakistan' being raised 
by the large public meeting.
    
He said, while the striving for freedom was inherent and 
indigenous, it was an established fact that whenever Pakistan 
cricket or hockey team won against India, the people in Srinagar 
raised Pakistani flags and distributed sweets.
    
"This is the inherent solidarity which is common among the people 
of Pakistan and those of the occupied valley," he said.
    
Earlier on arrival at the helipad from Keil, he was received among 
others by Azad Kashmir prime minister. Later, he left for 
Islamabad.APP

<a name="debt">Debt relief may affect ability to borrow</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Feb 5: The debt reschedulings by Paris and London clubs, 
essential in the long run though, are likely to compromise 
Pakistan's ability to borrow for years to come, thus putting at 
risk revival of its economy.
    
This view was expressed by John Williamson, Chief Economist, South 
Asia Region World Bank, who had come here to attend a seminar 
organized by the Pakistan Society of Development Economics in 
Islamabad.
    
He considered the development of cooperation with South Asia as the 
key to Pakistan's ability to overcome its problems of economic 
stagnation.
    
Pakistan, he however, told this correspondent later, had survived 
the imposition of sanctions relatively well, with economic growth 
remaining positive and inflation well below the level expected by 
external forecasters.
    
He, however, thought that only two strategic options were available 
to Pakistan now: either to seek to develop SAARC, or to go it alone 
as a member of the multilateral system, that is, adopt unilaterally 
a policy of free trade with a view to maximizing exports.
    
Drawing a bleak picture of present-day Pakistan, Williamson said , 
"Exports have been declining throughout this fiscal year, normal 
capital inflows have almost dried up, the country's weak 
credibility and policy uncertainties have discouraged foreign 
direct investment in particular, and foreign exchange reserves are 
still very low."
    
The advantage provided to Pakistan by the Cold War "has now ended", 
he said and pointed out that South Asia was the "most natural" 
economic partner of Pakistan, notwithstanding the most acute 
political problems with it.
    
Probing the potential of other regions for Pakistan, the WB 
Economist said that even if the Afghanistan conflict ends, the 
provision of transit routes for the export from the region of oil 
and gas, and the opportunities for exchanging a number of Pakistani 
industrial and agricultural products for energy supplies, would 
surely be worthwhile. But these hardly offered a basis for changing 
Pakistan's economic destiny", he felt.
    
As regards Iran, it was much more distant from Pakistan's 
industrial heartland in Punjab than are some of India's industrial 
regions," he opined.
    
He also attributed Pakistan's low foreign trade figures mainly to 
the low trade with neighbouring countries, and especially India. 
Despite their common membership of SAARC, recorded Indo-Pakistani 
trade was only about 1% of Pakistan's total trade.
    
Outlining the potential of India's market for long-term industrial 
development of Pakistan, Williamson noted that a whole type of 
trade, namely intra-industrial trade in manufactures, the very type 
of trade that has traditionally been nurtured by regional trade 
agreements, has been missing from Pakistan's export bundle.
    
One of the potential benefits for Pakistan from effective regional 
integration was the chance to develop a serious engineering 
industry, he suggested. "This is the part of the industrial sector 
that is critically dependent on the existence of a large network of 
suppliers, where economies of scale and scope really count."
    
Pakistan's economy alone, he pointed out, was too small to support 
much of this until development had proceeded a lot further, 
"whereas the chance to fill niches in the Indian market would offer 
it an opportunity of growing rapidly relatively soon."
    
He even considered it possible that Pakistan would be able to 
export cotton textiles, processed foods, and raw agricultural 
products, prospects enhanced by the country's ability to import 
world-class machinery and engineering goods to produce downstream 
products with a higher quality and technology content than India 
can aspire to so long as its downstream industries  are constrained 
to buy Indian inputs.
    
Williamson remained skeptical that SAARC would ever achieve the 
sort of deep economic integration that has been achieved in Europe 
without a transformation of political relations with India. 
Nevertheless, he did not rule out the possibility of a breakthrough 
because of the current political situation in an India ruled by 
BJP. In this connection, he saw the agreement on export of 
electricity from Pakistan to India as an encouraging indication 
that functional cooperation was possible between the current 
regimes.
    
Talking about the implications of "go-it-alone" strategy, Prof 
Williamson said this would involve a moderate uniform tariff of no 
more than 10 per cent and no other trade restrictions. 
   
Under such a policy, Pakistan may in the near term remain 
predominantly an exporter of low-tech consumer goods like cotton 
clothing and sports goods, perhaps branching out into non-cotton 
textiles.

<a name="powe">Power rates may go up by 10.75pc next month</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

HARIPUR, Feb 4: Federal Minister for Water and Power Gohar Ayub has 
said there is a proposal for 10.75 per cent increase in electricity 
tariff.
    
Talking to newsmen after the foundation stone-laying ceremony of a 
Technical Institute here on Thursday, he said proposal for the 
increase has been prepared, however the final decision will be 
taken by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority NEPRA by 
March this year.
    
He said the surplus electricity of about 1200 MW created by a 
successful operation of Army to control line losses and pilferage 
has led to ending loadshedding in most parts of the country.
    
Answering a question about utilization of surplus power by 2003 
when more power projects will start generating electricity, he said 
we will supply power to those parts of the country which do not 
have it. At present there is only 34 per cent area in the country 
having the facility, he added.
    
About Kalabagh Dam he said the Prime Minister has taken the 
decision that it should only be built after full consensus. 
Regarding Bhasha Dam he said, feasibility report is being prepared 
and it will take about five years to complete the project, he 
observed.
    
To a question about resistance of local people of northern areas 
for the project he said their objections are genuine as they must 
be offered an alternative land to settle when their present areas 
come under water. I am surveying the government land in Northern 
areas so that it can be offered to the people at the time of 
construction of the dam, he added.
    
He said it is a misconception that Army will be able to bring WAPDA 
out of deficit. It is just not possible as its losses are more than 
Rs72 billion and army has been given the target of Rs9 billion in 
connection with line losses and pilferage, he maintained.
    
He said no discrimination is being done while checking of Kundas 
and electricity meters by Army which is the sole reason for such 
early results of its operation. He said there are about 450,000 
Kundas and about 44000 defective meters in Karachi alone, once they 
are also taken care of, it will result into surplus electricity and 
more revenues for the KESC.PPI
    
Gohar Ayub said that the government had decided to bring KESC into 
the fold of Wapda-type arrangement to arrest the worsening 
situation, causing huge losses to the organization, adds APP.

<a name="vajp">Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan: Nawaz hopeful of breakthrough</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

HARIPUR, Feb 4: Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif on Thursday 
said Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's desire to travel 
on the inaugural bus service from New Delhi to Lahore indicated, he 
wanted to resolve disputes between the two countries.
    
"We welcome Indian Prime Minister's desire and will receive him 
with respect," the Prime Minister told reporters after inaugurating 
Hira Technical Institute for orphan children here.
    
Nawaz Sharif was asked to comment on Vajpayee's reported desire to 
come to Pakistan on cross-border passenger bus service which the 
two sides have decided to run between Lahore and New Delhi. A trial 
bus has already run from Lahore to New Delhi last month.
    
"We will sit with him and have detailed talks. We will make full 
use of this opportunity to resolve," the outstanding issues between 
the two sides, said Nawaz Sharif.
    
The Prime Minister said, he had read about Indian Prime Minister's 
desire to come to Pakistan on a bus. Vajpayee's intention showed, 
he was , "desirous of solving disputes", between the two 
neighbours.
    
Mr Sharif said, he too, had conveyed the same feelings to Indian 
Prime Minister, during his meetings and telephone call with the 
latter. He did not tell, when he talked to Vajpayee on telephone.
    
Vajpayee was quoted to have said on Wednesday while touring his 
home constituency in Lucknow, "personally I would like to take a 
bus ride to Lahore."
    
Fielding a question, on the establishment of military courts, Nawaz 
Sharif said, the government was quickly making necessary 
arrangements in this regard.
    
"The military courts will be set up wherever it is required," said 
the Prime Minister.
    
To a question on Karachi situation, he said, the conditions there 
were much better than before.
    
"Peace has been restored there and crimes have been rooted out," 
from the port city. He said, Karachi has become an abode of peace.
    
The Prime Minister said, he wanted there should be peace in every 
part of the country and there should be no terrorism, no 
sectarianism, gang rapes and murders.
    
He said, his main mission, was to provide justice to the people and 
establish permanent peace across the country.
    
"This is not my desire alone rather every Pakistani wants it," he 
said.APP

<a name="usba">US backs Pakistan's peace efforts, says Inderfurth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Feb 4: The US Assistant Secretary of State for South 
Asia, Carl Inderfurth, on Wednesday expressed satisfaction over the 
current US-Pakistan relations and assured continued American 
support to efforts being made by the government of Pakistan for 
promotion of peace and harmony in the region especially for 
improving relations with India.
    
Mr Inderfurth was on a short visit to Peshawar. He was accompanied 
by the US Ambassador in Pakistan, William B. Milam, and the 
American Consul General in Peshawar, Hanson Bradford.
    
Talking to NWFP chief minister Sardar Mahtab Ahmad Khan at his 
Frontier House office, Mr Inderfurth particularly mentioned the 
support extended by Washington to the economic measures introduced 
by the IMF for improvement of Pakistan's economy. He said "we have 
also been able to amicably resolve the long outstanding F-16 
issue." Inderfurth said that Washington fully supported the efforts 
being made by Pakistan for promotion of peace in the region.
    
Referring to drug trafficking, the US official told the chief 
minister that his government fully realised the difficulties and 
handicaps faced by the Pakistan Government. He assured continued 
American support and assistance to overcome the drug problem.
    
Sardar Mahtab, while expressing satisfaction over the recent 
successful visit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Washington, 
hoped that relations between their two countries would get 
stronger. He, too, expressed satisfaction over resolution of the F-
16 issue and mentioned the challenges Pakistan was facing in the 
economic sphere.
    
The NWFP chief minister made special mention of what he called an 
almost unbearable pressure on the provincial social sectors due to 
the prolonged presence of Afghan refugees in Pakistan majority of 
whom were concentrated in NWFP due to proximity of its western 
border with Afghanistan. The chief minister, therefore, laid 
greater stress on early return of the refugees to their homeland 
after normal conditions were restored in Afghanistan. 
    
About success in efforts to curb poppy cultivation in NWFP Sardar 
Mahtab said "we would not be fulfilling only our international 
commitments by doing so but also feel bound to get rid of this 
curse as our moral obligation."

<a name="open">Open letter to people: Benazir urges nation to demand fresh poll</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Feb 3: Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in an open 
letter to the people has called their attention towards the state 
of affairs of the country and urged them to denounce the Nawaz 
regime and demand fresh, impartial and fair polls.
    
The open letter, titled: "The Dictators are Returning," released 
here on Wednesday, also urged the nation to support a free press 
and ask Nawaz to disclose the names of those who syphoned foreign 
currency on the night it was frozen.
    
"Pakistan has entered a dark and dangerous hour. As the leader of 
the opposition it is my duty to you, to the consti tution, and to 
my own conscience to speak out about perils we face", Ms Bhutto 
said.
    
She alleged that under the guise of foreign and domestic threats of 
his own making, Nawaz was destroying our beloved nation and most 
tragically, he was destroying your hopes and dreams for prosperous 
and secure lives.
    
Since late May of 1998, the Nawaz regime had systematically 
dismantled our democracy, destroyed our economy and sullied 
Pakistan's good name throughout the world, the letter said.
    
"Recent actions by the regime, including intimidation of the free 
press, direct confrontation with the Supreme Court by instituting 
military courts throughout the country, disbanding of women's 
family courts and police stations, and freezing foreign currency 
accounts, are reprehensible steps. Taken together, they echo 
repressive steps from throughout history by the darkest and most 
dangerous of dictators", the open letter said.
    
Ms Bhutto, who is also chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party, 
urged the people of Pakistan to support a free press, and to 
continue to press Nawaz Sharif to answer for the people's $11 
billion now mysteriously unaccounted for after his freeze of the 
foreign currency accounts.
    
Ms Bhutto addressed the people: "You, the people of Pakistan, 
sacrificed mightily during the Zia years to support a democratic 
and pluralistic society. You have continually soughtthrough the 
ballot box the creator of a tolerant, free and prosperous nation. 

You have asked for government management that is responsive, fair 
and efficient. You have told the political leaders that you want 
opportunity, better education and the chance to improve your lives. 
On all of these accounts the Nawaz government has failed you. 
Pakistan's prosperity and position in the world has never been 
under a darker cloud than now.
    
"As you know, the Jang group has been under continued and worsening 
intimidation by the Nawaz regime, including threats, freezing of 
accounts, the unlawful withholding of newsprint and wire-tapping. 
Other free and independent media nation-wide are also under intense 
pressure by the Nawaz regime to silence their critical reporting of 
the Nawaz regime", she said.
    
The opposition leader said: "It is time for those who love our 
country, for those who struggle for tolerance, freedom and 
prosperity for all citizens, to take a stand, to tell Nawaz that he 
has gone too far, and that the people of Pakistan will not tolerate 
a return to dictatorship, no matter what the cost".
    
She, in her letter, said that Pakistan could not prosper under 
Nawaz's repression, mis-governance and corruption. "My fellow 
Pakistanis, under Nawaz's brutal hand, our country is being taken 
backward, not forward," she observed.

<a name="noas">No assurance given for CTBT signing: US</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Feb 2: Pakistan has apparently not given any "concrete 
assurance" to the US to sign the CTBT as the Indians have, a senior 
State Department spokesman indicated on Tuesday.
    
At his regular briefing spokesman Jamie Rubin was asked whether he 
could highlight any "concrete progress" made by the Strobe Talbott 
mission to India.
    
Rubin said: "We believe concrete progress was made with respect to 
the signing of the CTBT and the timing of that signing and we have 
some important movement on that... You may shake your head and 
frown but that is a fact."
    
Asked whether the Pakistanis had also offered Talbott a similar and 
more concrete assurance to sign the CTBT, Rubin said: "I am not 
aware of that."
    
He said the US goals in South Asia had not changed and repeated the 
five proposals which had been outlined to both India and Pakistan.
    
He also referred to the joint statement issued in Islamabad after 
the Talbott visit.

To begin with the two parties have agreed to cooperate in the 
National Assembly and Sindh legislature but with the passage of 
time this cooperation may be extended outside the assemblies.
    
A senior PPP leader confided to Dawn on Monday that negotiations 
between the two parties started a few days after the MQM parted 
ways with the PML-led coalition as "we have no doubt about the 
MQM's political influence in urban Sindh and we want this 
organization to develop a democratic culture".
    
PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto, after a personal contact Altaf 
Husain in London, had assigned Hyderabad-based leader Makhdoom Amin 
Fahim with the task of opening a dialogue with the MQM leaders. 
Senators Aftab Sheikh and Nasreen Jalil and MPA Dr Farooq Sattar 
joined the talks on the MQM's behalf. 
   
Mr Fahim also visited London once and met Mr Altaf Husain to 
"extend certain assurances on behalf of Ms Benazir Bhutto". For a 
brief period Ajmal Dehlvi had also been associated with these talks 
in the beginning.
    
As the two parties have a well demarcated sphere of political 
influence in Sindh, they will feel no difficulty in entering an 
electoral alliance "at an appropriate time".

<a name="arme">Armed Forces Ord amended: MTCs can be set up all over country</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 30: The federal government on Saturday amended the 
Pakistan Armed Forces (Acting in Aid of the Civil Power) 
Ordinance,1998, providing that military courts can be established 
in the whole of Pakistan.
    
The ordinance, issued by President Rafiq Tarar, amended section 1 
of the Ordinance XII of 1998, under which military courts were set 
up in Sindh only.
    
The amended ordinance adds that the words "such areas of Sindh" 
shall be substituted with the words " the whole of Pakistan".
    
The amendment in the Armed Forces Ordinance (Acting in Aid of the 
Civil Power) has come one day before a nine-member bench of the 
Supreme Court is scheduled to take up petitions challenging the 
establishment of military courts in Sindh.
    
The amended ordinance has also a new section, under which an 
absconding person can be tried in his absence. The new section 
reads as:
    
"10 A. Abscondence of accused: Any accused person may be tried in 
his absence if the court convened under section 3, after such 
inquiry as it deems fit, is satisfied that such absence is 
deliberate and brought about with a view to impeding the course of 
justice.
    
Provided that the accused person shall not be tried under this 
section unless proclamation has been published in the manner 
specified in section 87 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 
(Act V of 1898), requiring him to appear at a specified place 
within three days from the date of publishing such proclamation:
    
Provided further that the court shall proceed with the trial after 
taking necessary steps to appoint an advocate to defend the accused 
person who is not before the court."
    
An explanation, provided in the end of the ordinance, says: "An 
accused who is tried in his absence under this section shall be 
deemed not to have admitted the commission of an offence with which 
he has been charged".

<a name="tari">Tariff issue holding up power deal with India: official</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansar Abbasi

ISLAMABAD, Feb 5: Pakistan and India have agreed to meet again in 
March 1999 to finalise a deal between the two countries on the sale 
of electricity to Delhi by Islamabad.
    
"Further progress has been made from a point where we were standing 
before the visit," said a government source who was included in the 
five-member delegation that had recently visited India for second 
round of talks on power sale issue.
    
"Only the question of tariff on which the power will be supplied to 
India, is to be settled now," the source said, indicating that the 
third round is likely to be the final one to get to a point of 
agreement. The exact date for the third round of talks will be 
announced later.
    
The Pakistani delegation headed by secretary water and power Syed 
Shahid Husain and including chairman Wapda Lt Gen Zulfiqar Ali 
Khan, consultant to prime minister, Farogh Naveed, deputy GM 
finance, Muhammad Amjad and chief engineer Wapda private power 
organisation Noorul Haq, has held talks with India from Jan 29 to 
31.
    
The first round of talks was held between the two sides in November 
1998 when an Indian delegation led by power secretary Pardeep 
Biajal had visited Islamabad.
    
Pakistani team had gone with short-term and long-term proposals but 
the talks could only cover the issues concerning short-term 
strategy which envisages the sale of 300 MW to 500 MW. "Studies for 
long-term proposals will be conducted after agreeing to short-term 
scheme."

<a name="bids">Bids for two power sub-stations cancelled</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Jamal

LAHORE, Feb 4: The cancellation of the bids for the two substations 
at Moro and Rahimyar Khan and a 500 kv Jamshoro-Guddu transmission 
line on Tuesday has raised serious doubts about the Wapda's ability 
to complete these projects in time, that is, in December this year.
    
Wapda officials, who requested anonymity, told this reporter on 
Thursday that it was for the third time in about three and a half 
years that they had to cancel the bids for the $57 million project 
of the two substations.
    
The first bid for the construction of the substations was called in 
August 1995 and the second in December 1996. The third bid was 
called in October last year. This time Wapda combined the 
construction of the $84 million project of 3rd Jamshoro-Guddu 500 
kv transmission line with the bids for the substations.
    
The tenders from internationally reputed firms for the combined 
$141 million projects were called on turnkey basis. The successful 
bidder(s) was also required to arrange financing for the two 
projects. The interested parties were allowed to bid for either the 
substations or the transmission line or both.
    
The transmission line and the substations are part of the 3rd 500 
kv circuit from Jamshoro to Lahore.
    
A senior Wapda official expressed his ignorance about the causes 
for the cancellation of two previous bids for the substations, but 
said the recent tenders were cancelled because of lack of response 
from the international firms.
    
Another official said the previous bids were called off because 
Wapda could not secure competitive prices for the projects. He said 
the bids could also not materialize because of 'representations' 
made to the Authority by the 'losing' firms and their agents 
against the 'winners' of the contracts. He said such tactics were 
commonly used by the losers to delay the project or frustrate the 
winners.
    
The cancellation of the recent tenders is an interesting story in 
itself. Of the seven firms which purchased tenders for the project, 
only three  two European and one Chinese  were actually present 
when the tenders were opened by Wapda.
    
One of the three prospective bidders failed to arrange financing. 
Another withdrew itself for more or less similar reasons. It did 
not quote the price and sent a note of 'regret alone. The agents of 
the third bidder  a Chinese firm  arrived late by 10 minutes and 
were not allowed to participate in the process at all in spite of 
the fact that they claimed to have arranged foreign financing for 
the projects.
    
While the construction of the Moro and Rahimyar Khan substations is 
yet to start, the 3rd Jamshoro-Guddu 500 kv transmission line 
commenced in Jan 1996. However, due to non-availability of tower 
material and conductor, the work on the project remained limited to 
foundations only. It was further slowed down by the contractors as 
their payments were delayed by Wapda because of its financial 
constraints.
    
Some Rs 2.5 billion have so far been spent to complete 53 per cent 
tower foundations of the transmission line so far.

<a name="comm">Commercial credit will be cleared soon: SBP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Feb 4: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has stressed the 
need for stabilisation in policies and persuasion of structural 
reforms to transform the current economic improvement into durable 
trends.
    
'Redoubled efforts were needed to collect revenue, contain low 
priority expenditures and reduce budget deficit,' observed the 
Central Board of Directors of SBP which met at Lahore on Thursday 
under the chairmanship of Governor, Dr Mohammed Yaqub.
    
According to an announcement, the Board called for restructure of 
finances of public sector corporations, restrain public sector 
borrowing, improve debt profile and promote private saving and 
investment.
    
In addition to taking several administrative policy decisions, the 
Board reviewed in detail the recent economic and financial 
developments in the country.
    
The Board forecast a reduction in inflation rate by 0.8% to 7% by 
end of current fiscal year as compared to 7.8% rate of inflation in 
1997-98.
    
The increase in Consumer Price Index during July-Dec 1998 period 
was calculated at 6.5% as compared to 9.8% during the same period 
last year.
    
Briefing on the current state of economy, the SBP Governor said 
that Pakistan had continued to pay its debt on time to all 
international financial institutions and in addition, all external 
payment arrears on the current account of the balance of payments 
(except one item of portfolio investment) have by now been cleared.
    
As regards external debt payments other than those to international 
financial organisations, Paris Club countries last week agreed to 
restructure on very favourable terms international and principal 
falling due upto December 2000, including the pending arrears, and 
the same treatment is expected to be received from non-Paris Club 
countries and commercial creditors.
    
Commercial credit that is not subject to restructuring will soon 
begin to be cleared for payment, the SBP meeting observed.
    
Despite of the substantial payments that have recently been made, 
foreign exchange reserves have increased to dollars 1.7bn as on Feb 
4, 1999. 
    
Moreover, a healthy banking system operating under prudential and 
regulatory framework of the State Bank was of critical importance 
for promotion of savings and investment and re-building confidence, 
the meeting observed.APP

signed by the Government of Balochistan and the Australian firm 
last year on the project under which Balochistan will have 25% of 
the total equity while the share of the company will be 75%. 
    
However, Balochistan government will not pay any amount for initial 
expenditure.

packing facilities to the growers in the province.
    
It was further informed that the fluorite found in the province 
will be sold to other provinces. 
   
The Balochistan Development Authority (BDA) will sell 1500 tonnes 
of fluorite to Pakistan Steel Mill and 1000 tonnes to Pakistan 
Atomic Energy Commission.APP

<a name="budg">Budget basics  be revealed to elicit public opinion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 3: The Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) 
has urged the government to reveal the fundamentals of the 1999-
2000 budget in advance to elicit public opinion and to avoid post-
budget disputes and crisis as is the practice in some other 
countries.
    
The KCCI said that post-budget crises witnessed every year lead to 
the rectification of anomalies and other changes which could be 
avoided.
    
President, KCCI, Abdullah Ismail in a pre-budget proposal for 1999-
2000 submitted to the government said that the problem could be 
greatly alleviated if the process of pre-budget consultation is 
strengthened.
    
On Ushr, the chamber chief said that prices of agricultural 
products have been rising but the collection of Ushr is declining.
    
According to World Bank Report on Pakistan Poverty Assessment, full 
collection of Ushr could generate revenue in the range of Rs10-15 
billion annually at current prices.
    
He said according to KCCI estimates, Rs5.6 billion can easily be 
collected if five per cent of net sale prices, on Ushr account, is 
deducted (on the pattern of withholding tax) by sugar mills, 
ginners, rice mills etc at the time of making purchases of major 
agricultural produce like sugarcane, cotton, rice and wheat from 
growers.
    
The KCCI called for abolition of low yielding taxes like CVT, 
withholding tax on electricity bills, cars etc, which only serve to 
cause harassment and corruption. Moreover, licence fee for radio, 
TV, VCR etc may be considered for abolition.
    
The chamber feels that present direct taxation structure is 
exploitative in nature and penalizes the honest assessee whilst 
rewarding those willing to accommodate such officials who have 
their personal interest more at heart.
    
To enable the assessees to pay their due taxes without fear of 
harassment the KCCI proposes that all returns should be under Self 
Assessment Scheme (SAS) even where loss has been declared. 
    
The chamber added that in all returns including those filed under 
SAS, if within nine months of filing of return no discrepancy is 
detected by the assessing officer the return would constitute final 
assessment.
    
The exemption limit for income tax should be raised to Rs75,000. 
The KCCI proposed that taxable income slab at five per cent for 
Rs75,001-Rs200,000, 10 per cent for Rs200,001-300,000, 15 per cent 
for Rs300,001-Rs 400,000 and 20 per cent for Rs400,000 and above.
    
The chamber said that dividends declared by all types of companies 
would be tax-free in the hands of the share holders. The tax rate 
for all limited companies is proposed at 25 per cent except for 
non-listed private limited companies which should be taxed at 30 
per cent for encouraging them to get listed. Besides, wealth tax 
needs to be abolished.
    
To broaden the tax base, wherever income is generated be taxed 
accordingly and deducted at source under the presumptive tax 
regime.
    
The KCCI suggested the government to do away with the existing 
Income Tax Ordinance as there is a need for re-drafting of present 
law. The existing law vests innumerable discretionary powers in the 
tax assessing and collection authorities.
    
The chamber said that the total impact of direct taxes should not 
be more than 20 per cent of taxable income of an assessee as 
sometimes the total impact of direct taxes subject to income tax as 
well as wealth tax and exceeds his total taxable income which is 
very harsh and against all of norms of justice. In case of 
individuals there should be a maximum limit of total direct taxes 
(income tax and wealth tax) as percentage of his taxable income.
    
Income from employees retirement related benefits i.e. provident 
fund, superannuation fund, gratuity funds should be wholly exempted 
from tax.
    
To encourage private savings and investment, assessees may be 
allowed to invest up to Rs200,000 or one third of the income in 
specified securities and life insurance which ever is less with the 
incentive of outright deduction from total income as was available 
before.
    
The KCCI also called for abolition of turnover tax as it is very 
against the basic concept of income tax.

<a name="100p">100-page passports to be issued soon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Feb 2: The issuance of hundred-page passports to 
facilitate overseas Pakistanis is a matter of days as all 
modalities have been finalized and sent to the interior ministry 
for approval, said sources in the directorate of passport here on 
Tuesday.
    
At initial stage this facility would be provided at the federal 
capital while the proposal to issue such passports from four 
Pakistani missions abroad, including Abu Dhabi, Jeddah and London, 
is also under way, said director general of passport Nawaz Sheikh 
while talking to APP.
    
Computerization of passports is also being planned to to improve 
the efficiency of the department by introducing machine readable 
passport system, he said.
    
After the initiation of this system Pakistan passports would be 
considered equivalent to international standards, he added.
    
Explaining the issuance process, the DG said the fee for the 100-
page passports would be Rs7,500 while the same process would be 
adopted to issue these passports which was in practice earlier to 
avoid any extra fatigue.
    
He said prior to June 2 a new passport was only issued if the 
remaining validity of the existing passport was less than seven 
months, but now onwards the passports with the remaining validity 
of seven months would also be extended up to next five years.
    
Earlier on exhaustion of the pages or loss of passport, a new one 
was issued only for the remaining period of the passport, but now 
it had been decided to issue passports in both cases for five years 
irrespective of the validity of the previous passport, he informed.
    
He said that validity of the previous passport whatever it may be, 
would not be taken into consideration and new passport valid for 
five years would be issued.
    
Nawaz Sheikh said that after the introduction of the machine 
readable passports scheme not only people would be facilitated but 
it would also help minimize the fatigue of the officials.
    
This scheme would take four to five months to reach the final stage 
after which tenders would be called and the process would hopefully 
be completed in one year time, he added.APP

<a name="paki">Pakistan, US talks on surge in yarn export</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Feb 1: Pakistan and the US will have two days of 
important textile talks in Washington on Feb 10 and 11 to discuss a 
sudden jump in Pakistani yarn exports and increase in Pakistani 
textile quotas, officials said on Monday.
    
Secretary Commerce Mansoor Ilahi will lead the Pakistan delegation 
for two days of negotiations with Chief US Textiles Negotiator, 
Ambassador Don Johnson, officials said. Johnson was sworn into his 
office by Vice President Al-Gore on Nov 20 last year.
    
The US recently issued an alert on Category 301 Yarn saying its 
exports had jumped suddenly and was hurting the US industry.
    
Pakistan maintains that the depreciation in the value of the 
Pakistani rupee after the imposition of sanctions and freezing of 
foreign account had turned import of Pakistani yarn into a 
lucrative business for US importers, who took advantage of the 
opportunity.
    
Pakistan will also raise the issue of increasing Pakistani textile 
quotas for value-added items, a matter raised by Commerce Minister 
Ishaq Dar with the US Trade Representative in WTO meetings in 
Geneva.
    
It is not clear whether the US will agree to enhance the Pakistani 
quotas but Islamabad argues that when these quotas were fixed, 
Pakistan's value-added industry and exports were not fully grown 
and now they had increased their potential.
    
Sources said the Secretary of Commerce was likely to take a tough 
stand against any US anti-dumping duties on Pakistani yarn.
    
The commerce secretary was until a couple of years ago the economic 
minister at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington and he knows the ins 
and out of the Washington bureaucracy and how to deal with it, a 
source said.
    
Some representatives of the Pakistani private sector textile 
associations will also accompany the delegation to Washington to 
monitor the talks and provide immediate assistance to the 
officials, should they need it.
    
The two sides will also discuss procedural issues related to the 
WTO, sources said.

Foundation and a Turkish company for buying the Mills. He did not 
tell about the name of the Turkish company. "You would know it 
soon".
    
To a question, Kh. Asif said that the interests of the workers of 
the mills will be fully protected by the government before its 
privatization. He said that the reference price of the mills was 
currently being worked out by the officials of the Privatization 
Commission.
    
He also disclosed that the process of privatizing 8 Area 
Electricity Boards of WAPDA has started.

Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) will start within 
the month of February and that the PC was receiving a good response 

both from the local and foreign companies for the transaction.

<a name="rice">Rice export may fetch $780 million this fiscal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaukat Ali

LAHORE, Feb 2: Rice exporters have got orders to export over 1.9 
million ton rice so far as the country heads towards a record 
shipment target of three million ton this year, ministry of 
commerce sources told Dawn here on Tuesday. 
    
"The way Pakistani rice is being taken by foreign buyers due to its 
high quality and price competitiveness there is every likelihood 
that during the next two months another about 1.1 million ton rice 
is booked for export", the ministry officials said. 
    
Pakistan is lucky this season to grow rice more by 700,000 tons 
than the target of 4.71 million ton. It was expected in November 
last year that there would be a surplus of about 2.53 million ton 
for selling to foreign buyers but now the target has been enhanced 
to three million ton due to high yield. 
    
"There is an increased demand of rice from Far-Eastern region 
including South Korea, Indonesia, Japan and Singapore this year", 
sources said claiming that rice consignments to Indonesia had 
increased by 100 per cent this year over the last year. Demand from 
EU countries, they said, was also on the rise from where exporters 
were getting rate as high as $ 770 per ton. "The ministry hopes 
that around $ 780 million will be earned through the rice export 
during 1998-99, which will be a record", the officials added. 
    
Pakistan earned about Rs 23 billion from the rice export during 
1997-98 which was around Rs 5.5 billion higher than the preceding 
year. In the meantime, agriculturists in the Punjab believe that 
with the breakthrough in the high yielding rice seeds research in 
the form of two new varieties of seeds  PP 95 and Shaheen  the 
country will be able to get more produce next year as the new seeds 
promise to enhance per unit area yield. "The two new varieties are 
as good as the world renowned basmati. Experts feel that the new 
species may excel basmati in quality", Chaudhry Nazir Ahmed, a rice 
grower in Gojranwala division told this reporter. He said many rice 
growers were fully convinced that the new genus could be grown in 
fields where hitherto only ordinary varieties were produced.

<a name="heav">Heavy selling in PTCL and Hub-Power shares</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 4: Heavy selling in PTCL and Hub-Power on Thursday 
again pushed the market into the minus column as investors were not 
inclined to hold long positions owing to a number of negative news 
and three closures ahead. The KSE 100-share index shed over 24 
points or 2.7 per cent at 867.73 points.
    
The market will remain close on Friday on account of Kashmir 
protest day to express solidarity with the people of Kashmir and 
Saturday and Sunday being official closures.
    
There was, therefore, no trace of the overnight technical rally 
when the trading resumed and as negative news kept pouring in from 
the opening bell, sellers dominated the trading.
    
But what seemed to have caused nervous selling in Hub-Power was 
rumours that its share might be delisted if its management decides 
to shut its power generation operations, analysts said adding "Its 
management has already given termination notice to the government.
    
"The unresolved Hubco issue has provided a strong manoeuvring 
leverage to the speculative forces who tilt the balance in their 
favour whenever they like", floor brokers said.
    
News that the privatization of the PTCL could be further delayed 
was another negative factor, which prompted nervous selling in it, 
pushing its price sharply lower, they added.
    
The KSE index fell 2.7 per cent or 24.22 points at 867.73 as 
compared to 891.95 a day earlier as the leading base shares fell in 
unison on persistent selling.
    
The market should have reacted favourably to reports that the KSE 
high-ups have sought a meeting with the prime minister to discuss 
the problems being faced by it and its inability to respond to some 
positive developments on the economic front, notably the resumption 
of the foreign aid and rescheduling of Pakistan's foreign debt by 
the Paris Club.
    
Although Hubco's management has obtained a court stay for its 
freezed bank account the perception of lower annual profits and 
further erosion in its share value kept investors at their toes all 
the time, with selling at times touching panic proportions, dealers 
said.
    
The selling in part was also attributed to Friday's closure on 
account of Kashmir day as jobbers and short-term dealers liquidated 
positions in a bit haste fearing further decline in prices, they 
added.
    
Minus signs dominated list, with leading MNCs being in the 
forefront of losing shares under the lead of Lever Brothers, which 
suffered a fresh setback of Rs 34.00 followed by Engro Chemical, 
which was quoted ex-dividend at Rs 73.00, off Rs 6.50.
    
Other prominent losers were led by PSO, which came in for renewed 
selling, Sitara Spinning and Shell Pakistan, falling by Rs 2.10 to 
2.50. All other declines were fractional and reflected lack of 
support rather large selling. 
    
Most of the gains were below one rupee barring Dadabhoy Sack, which 
showed a gain of Rs 2.00 on active support.
    
Telecard though ended higher fractionally, accounted for large 
volume ahead of board meeting and expectations of a good payout.
    
Owing to heavy selling in the pivotals, the traded volume rose to 
85m shares from the previous 56m shares, while losers forced a 
strong lead over the gainers at 65 to 35, with 52 shares holding on 
to the last levels.
    
PTCL topped the list of most actives, off 75 paisa at Rs 17.25 on 
32m shares followed by Hub-Power, easy 35 paisa at Rs 11.25 on 26m 
shares, PSO, off Rs 2.10 at Rs 57.60 on 9m shares, Fauji 
Fertiliser, lower 75 paisa at Rs 39.75 on 3m shares, ICI Pakistan, 
unchanged at Rs 8.65 on 2m shares.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

ONE night in Lahore, in 1973, after having not touched base with 
the Alams of 90 Upper Mall for several years, I barged into their 
home and invited myself to dinner. Over chicken and chapatis I 
enquired after the health and welfare of Sheherezade, the daughter. 
Parents Mahmood and Surayya adopted funereal expressions. She has 
gone and got married, said Mahmood gloomily.
    
Surely that would make for joy and jubilation, why the gloom and 
doom? She has married an artist, answered Surayya, Zahoor-ul-Akhlaq 
by name. That makes it even better, I said, it adds another 
'character' to the family. That may be so, responded Mahmood, but 
wait until you meet him. Shades of the Neanderthal Man!
    
I didn't have to wait long. As I drove out, the gate was blocked by 
a rickshaw, with a jeans-clad hirsute young man stooping by its 
side, his hands diving alternately into his right and left pockets. 
Drawing up, I enquired whether I could help. He thanked me, mumbled 
'Theek ho jaiga,' and continued to fumble until he had gathered 
sufficient change to satisfy the rickshawalla. The son-in-law? I 
wondered. I asked him to get into my car. Without hesitation, 
without asking me who I was, why I had asked him to get in, where I 
wanted to take him, he silently settled himself in.
    
We drove to my hotel and talked through most of the night. In his 
own way, he made a lot of sense, on his own and on many another 
subject. There was little he did not know about art and graphic 
design. Though I had established his identity, he never even 
bothered to ask me who I was. When the bottles were empty he rose 
to go, but as steadily as he walked I thought it prudent to drive 
him back. When we met again, Zahoor had no recollection of that 
night.
    
I assured the Alams that Sheherezade was married to a man who, 
though he did not have many letters trailing after his name, was a 
profoundly educated man, a decent human being, more decent than 
most, and though she may have to accustom herself to his drinking 
habits, their daughter would never starve. Zahoor was a talented 
man, with great potential. He could go far, he could achieve much.  
The Alam family has to be described to be understood. The head of 
the family at that time was grandfather Mehboob Alam, captain of 
the Aligarh hockey team from 1914-1918. A handsome man who had 
maintained his sportsman's build, he puffed incessantly on a hookah 
loaded with his own special brew. His young contemporary, chemist 
Professor Saleemuzzaman Siddiqui, the first of our two Fellows of 
the Royal Society (the other being Abdus Salam, largely ignored as 
being a citizen of this country), was wont to refer to Mehboob as 
"a beautiful animal."
    
Son Mahmood had played tennis for Pakistan at Wimbledon in 1948, at 
Roland Garros, and at the Davis Cup matches. In 1964, he captained 
the Pakistan team which won the Shahinshah Cup at Tehran and in 
1965 the team won it again in Beirut. To this day he dons his white 
flannels and is a regular spectator at the tennis courts of the 
Lahore Gymkhana.
    
Mahmood's wife, Surayya, is the strength and steady provider of the 
family. Since 1953, she has run a nursery school through which some 
5,000 children have passed. Many have turned out to be fine and 
worthwhile citizens, but she is often greatly dismayed when she 
recognizes the names of the once innocent toddlers as hulks who 
have landed up in our various parliaments and governments.
    
Mahmood's eldest son Asad was head boy and tennis champion of 
Aitcheson, and is perfectly equipped to survive in Pakistan. He now 
spends a lot of his time in Karachi's High Court fighting a land 
case against the PWD, filed in 1996 which has so far been fixed 51 
times, heard 23 times, and adjourned 28 times. His barrister, 
Mohammed Gilbert Naim-ur-Rahman, presses on relentlessly.
    
Sheherazade, the only daughter, is a highly talented potter who 
learnt at Lahore's National College of Arts. She has lost her 
husband, Zahoor, and her eldest daughter, Jehanara, a gifted 
classical dancer, both irreplaceable. We grieve with her.
    
Shaban, the youngest son, is a finance man, a Princeton graduate 
with an MBA from Stanford. One good friend he made at Stanford was 
Steve Ballmer, now president of Bill Gates's Microsoft. Shaban, was 
called back to this land of opportunity, having worked with Solomon 
Brothers in the US, and is now a master-cutter. Horrified to 
observe the majority of Pakistani males eternally clad in their 
nightsuits, he decided to try to do something about persuading them 
to get dressed. As Shahbaz Sharif's cutter, he has helped transform 
his province's chief minister.
    
Over the years, Zahoor, son-in-law, brother-in-law and husband, a 
man of few words, pacifist non-pareil, the gentlest man imaginable 
who could probably not even swat a fly, became my close and most 
reliably unreliable friend. He would telephone to announce his 
arrival for lunch one day and turn up a month later.  Zahoor 
studied at the Lahore art school known as the Mayo College of Arts, 
founded in 1875 by John Lockwood Kipling, Rudyard's father, curator 
of the Central Museum of Lahore, who was also the Mayo's first 
principal. Sadly, the college was governmentalized in 1958 and 
renamed the National College of Arts. Zahoor later taught there and 
from 1976 to 1987 held the post of Dean of the Faculty of Fine 
Arts. He won many scholarships, one being the 1987 Fulbright 
Scholarship which took him out of Pakistan for a year.
    
Before he left, his friends got together to bid him au revoir. 
People were invited to meet him "... subject to the appearance of 
ZuA," to view Zahoor's magnificent triptych, his vision of Jinnah 
and those who he knew and worked with. The dress was "summer 
festive," decorations to be worn were to be "awarded, applied for 
and obtained, stolen or purchased," the card was transferable "to 
gunmen-non-escorted, non-moaner-groaners, and non-whiner-wailers." 
It was to be a fun affair.
Zahoor's attached curriculum vitae, inter alia, informed everyone 
that he was born an Aquarian on February 4 1941, had done his 
postgraduate studies at Hornsey College of Arts, London and at the 
Royal College of Arts, had had his works exhibited in Pakistan, 
Bangladesh, the US, Japan, Brazil, Italy, France, Iran, Ceylon and 
Canada, with his works hanging in galleries and private collections 
in as many countries. It also described his "Experience" : "1976 - 
Jailed without trial (with other NCA professors) on the orders of 
the then minister of education and culture (now himself in jail - 
'The mills of God....) for the alleged gangrape of a woman in 
Lahore whilst he was actually physically in Islamabad. He was duly 
dubbed 'Jinsy Billa' (sexy tomcat) by one of our leading Urdu 
newspapers. He and the others were tried and honourably acquitted 
by the Lahore High Court in 1979."
    
Asad rang in the afternoon of January 18, the eve of Eid-ul-Fitr, 
to tell me that Zahoor and his daughter Jehanara had been 
inexplicably shot, for no imaginable reason, and were both dead. 
Though not a great weeper and wailer, no great mourner, I decided 
to get to Lahore as soon as I could, PIA and the CAA 
notwithstanding. Thanks to the in-fighting of the Abbasi duo, head-
honchos of our disgraceful national airline, my journey to Lahore 
took eighteen hours.
    
On arrival at the Alam's house, I was met by a stunned Bashir 
Ahmad, miniature painter and Zahoor's loyal assistant. To see 
Zahoor and Bashir together was to conjure up visions of the 
Sorcerer and his Apprentice. Bashir had always prepared Zahoor's 
canvases. Now his task was to give him his last bath, and to carry 
him to his grave. Hundreds had congregated to see off Zahoor and 
Jehanara. It was one of those rare occasions when the grief was 
genuine in the utmost. None had turned up merely to 'be seen.'
    
The murderer was a guest at Zahoor's flat. A disciple and a 
frequent visitor at the shrine of Shah Jamal, he himself can find 
no reason for what he did. When asked why, after having shot four 
and killed two, he did not feel that he should turn his gun upon 
himself, his answer was that the tenets of his religion may not 
prevent him from killing others but they do prevent him from 
killing himself.
    
How our leaders and preachers have brutalized society, and warped 
the minds of our youth, all in the name of religion. I can almost 
hear my 'chariya' friend mumbling, "Theek ho jaiga."

Irfan Husain

A foreigner arriving in Pakistan for the first time and browsing 
through recent newspaper headlines could be excused for thinking he 
had landed in one huge madhouse.
    
Consider some recent gems, keeping in mind that residents of 
lunatic asylums come to think of their surroundings and the antics 
of their friends normal after a time. A major story these last few 
days has focused on Humaira and Mahmood Butt, a young couple who, 
being adult and of sane minds, decided to get married. So what's 
the big deal? the average foreigner will ask. It has taken a High 
Court order to get her released from police custody, and she hasn't 
been able to join her husband. She fears for her life, and that of 
her spouse. If she and Mr Butt are lucky, they might be able to go 
abroad if they want to live normal lives.
    
Clearly, this is not a normal situation. All over the world, 
consenting adults are at liberty to choose their partners, and if 
their parents don't like it, so be it. Here, if the girl's father 
has clout, then he can make her life a living hell, and the cops 
will help him arrest the young couple before they can fly over this 
cuckoo's nest. No, I'm afraid the average gora will have a hard 
time comprehending this one.
    
Or take the story about Hubco's accounts being frozen (yet again). 
Here is a major group that has invested billions in Pakistan's 
biggest thermal electric plant. Over the last year or so, its 
executives have been jailed, dragged off planes, besieged with 
their families and generally humiliated in every possible way. Now, 
just after we had been assured by the government that this 
unsavoury confrontation with the Independent Power Producers was 
over, we hear that Hubco's bank accounts have been frozen because 
of outstanding taxes. Well, if this method is to be used to collect 
taxes in future, not many ministers or MPs in this government will 
be able to write cheques much longer. Yes, I'm afraid our bemused 
gora is definitely going to have trouble with this one.
    
But the biggest puzzler currently occupying this country's 
attention is the Jang-Saif confrontation. First of all, it is 
difficult for an outsider to understand why Pakistan's biggest 
newspaper is called "War" to begin with. But let's put this aside 
as I haven't fathomed it either. The point here is that the group 
has fully lived up to its masthead. All governments have problems 
with newspaper editors and owners. In civilized democracies, these 
differences are discussed over a five-course lunch and a couple of 
bottles of vintage wine. And even if a meeting of minds is not 
achieved by the time the chocolate mousse arrives, there is no 
police raid on the newspaper office. And newsprint stocks are never 
sealed, nor are bank accounts ever frozen.
    
What is even more fascinating than Senator Saifur Rahman's views as 
expressed on Mir Shakil's tape recorder is his indignation at the 
fact that his words have been preserved for posterity. The man was 
livid that he had been bugged. What did he expect when he has been 
playing hard ball of the most vicious kind? While I was trying to 
make sense of this saga the other day, I said to myself: "Hey, 
whoa! What's happened to my good friend Mushahid Hussain? I thought 
he was information minister!" I checked around, and nope, there had 
been no cabinet reshuffle while I looked the other way. In the old 
days, I remember it was the information ministry that used to lean 
on newspapers, and make editors and owners see the error of their 
ways. Obviously, Mushahid hadn't leaned hard enough, and the big 
guns had to be called in.
    
Actually, Saif is more of a loose cannon than a top gun. He has 
single-handedly done more damage to this government than anybody 
else. And he has had some serious competition. Starting with his 
insane harassment of the IPPs, going on to his pointless 
embarrassment of Labour MP George Galloway for supporting us on 
Kashmir, we have his reckless confrontation with Pakistan's most 
powerful media group. So far, he has scared away foreign investors 
and anybody abroad wanting to publicly take our side against India 
over Kashmir. Like the proverbial bull in the china shop, he has 
damaged the economy, harmed our foreign policy and is now 
determined to destroy the government's relations with the press.
    
What he has not been able to do despite two years and millions 
spent is to attain his primary objective of nailing Benazir Bhutto 
and Asif Zardari. Considering the wealth of hearsay information and 
hard data available, the man ought to be sacked for incompetence. 
The fact that to date there is not a conviction on the horizon does 
not speak well for the efficiency of the Ehtesab Cell. After 
spending a fortune on obtaining documents relating to the Bhutto 
and Zardari accounts in Switzerland, Saif has been unable to 
deliver the knockout punch. Perhaps it is his frustration and 
feeling of failure that is leading him to seek other, softer 
targets.
    
If so, he's out of luck with Mir Shakilur Rahman. The Jang boss has 
given as good as he has got, using his dwindling newsprint stocks 
to run a series of stinging ads featuring the accountability head 
honcho in a less than flattering light. While all this is very 
exciting stuff, our imaginary gora will say, what happens next? 
Will sense prevail, or will the Jang get blown away? Well, judging 
by our track record, sense never prevails when it should. There are 

voices whispering that after having brought all other institutions 
to their knees, the Sharif government is now determined to bring 
the press to heel. When you think about it, the one tangible 
benefit we have got to show for a decade of democracy is a free 
press. Credit for this must be divided between Junejo, Benazir 
Bhutto and yes, Nawaz Sharif. The latter may have advanced a very 
lucrative form of "lifafa" journalism in his earlier stint as 
Punjab chief minister, and then as prime minister, but he did not 
actively snatch away our hard-won freedom.
    
In this stint, cursed by a "heavy mandate" that has not translated 
into any meaningful policies, except those aimed at concentrating 
yet more power in his hands, he seems bent on taking self-
destructive steps that threaten to unravel the entire system. We 
are precariously placed as it is. For him and his inner circle to 
cynically play with our destiny at this juncture is the very height 
of irresponsibility.
    
As a young deputy secretary in Mr Bhutto's secretariat in the mid-
seventies, I remember an occasion when the tempestuous PM was 
annoyed at something that had appeared in Jang. He asked the 
information minister to sort out the erring newspaper. Mr Yusuf 
Buch, special assistant for information, cautioned his boss, 
pointing out that Jang was a national institution, and that little 
good would come from a confrontation. On that occasion, at least, 
Mr Bhutto paid heed to this good advice. Will Nawaz Sharif?

<a name="bats">Pakistani batsmen give a poor display in 2nd Test</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Representative

NEW DELHI, Feb 5: Two fine deliveries and five horrendous shots 
left Pakistan with a mountain to climb in the second and final 
cricket Test against India at the Ferozeshah Kotla ground on 
Friday.
    
Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad succumbed to mesmerizing deliveries but 
Shahid Afridi, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Salim Malik, Yousuf Youhana and Moin 
Khan made a mess of things as Pakistan crashed out for 172 in just 
64.3 overs under chilly conditions.
    
India, one-down in the series, were earlier bowled out for 252 
after having resumed this morning at 247 for eight. With a first 
innings cushion of 80 runs under the belth, the home team reached 
46 for the loss of Venkatasai Laxman at the draw of stumps on the 
second day.
    
Akram cut Laxman into half and sent his off-stump cartwheeling to 
take his tally of wickets to 361 and just one shy of equalling 
Imran Khan's all-time Pakistan record of 362.
    
On an uneven and difficult wicket, the Pakistan stroke-makers 
didn't apply themselves and virtually threw away their wickets 
while attempting over-ambitious shots.
    
Inzamam-ul-Haq attempted a wristy on-drive off Kumble to find his 
leg-stump uprooted. Haw now has scores of 10, 51 and 26 which 
doesn't do justice to his talent and potential.
    
Salim Malik looked sound and watchful until a casual-looking gentle 
push ended his innings. He was caught by Mohammad Azharuddin at 
short-extra-cover off a bat and pad off Venkatesh Prasad. Moin Khan 
couldn't repeat his heroics this time as he tried to pull Javagal 
Srinath and ended up being hit low on the left pad and plumb in 
front of the wickets.
    
Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad could hardly do anything to negotiate 
one of the finest deliveries of the match so far.
    
If there were two good dismissals and five poor shots, there were 
two controversial decisions as well. Wasim Akram should consdier 
himself a bit unlucky after being adjudged lbw off Harbhajan Singh 
though television replays confirmed that the bat had taken the 
inner edge of the match before hitting the pads.
    
Saqlain Mushtaq, for the third successive time, was a victim of 
poor umpiring  this time Steve Bucknor giving a decision which he 
might regret after watching the replays again on television. 
Saqlain was declared lbw off Anil Kumble when the ball, which was 
drifting down the leg side as confirmed by the movement of the 
wicket-keeper, hit him low down on his left leg. Bucnknow first 
smiled mischieviously and three seconds later gave marching orders 
to the Pakistani.
    
India successfully negotiated the final 20 overs the second day's 
play with Sadagopan Ramesh leading the way. The left-hander batted 
brilliantly for his 24 in India=92s 46 for one, hitting four 
boundaries. His final boundary of the day at mid-on against Mushtaq 
Ahmad's goggle spoke volumes of the confidence he was in.
    
With India leading by 126 runs, wicket playing dangerously, the 
temperament of Pakistani batsmen an open secret and last but not 
the least, their poor record while batting fourth, leaves an open 
writing on the wall, of course, barring the glorious uncertainties 
of the game.

<a name="vict">Victorious Pakistan Jr squash team returns home</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 1: Victorious Pakistan team returned here from Kuala 
Lumpur on Monday afternoon after maintaining its unprecedented 
domination in the ninth Asian Juniors Squash Championship by 
outplaying hosts Malaysia by 3-0 on Sunday.
    
On Saturday defending champions Pakistan also outplayed Hong Kong 
by 3-0.
    
The team on arrival at the airport was, among others, received by 
Pakistan Squash Federation's Secretary Sq-leader S.M.Fazal who flew 
here from Islamabad. The federation secretary told Dawn that 
Pakistan gave an outstanding performance by retaining both the 
individual and team titles for the ninth successive year since the 
championship was instituted.
    
He praised all the members of the team and particularly of Mansoor 
Zaman who twice defeated the reigning world junior champion Ong 
Beng Hee of Malaysia. Defending champion Mansoor Zaman, the son of 
former British Open winner Qamar Zaman, first beat Beng Hee in the 
individual final to retain the Asian junior title and on Sunday the 

highly talented youngster recorded a 9-6, 6-9, 9-5, 9-4 victory 
over the Malaysian number one. Mohammad Ilyas played the first 
match and outplayed Kelvin Ho 9-2, 9-2, 9-2 and Shahid Zaman had 
the better of Azlan by 2-1 in the last match of the final.
    
The other member of the victorious team is Farrukh Zaman. Former 
international Maqsood Ahmed was the coach of the team and Tariq 
Rana as manager.

<a name="abba">Abbas scores twice in Pakistan's 4-1 win against India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

NEW DELHI, Feb 5: Sohail Abbas scored twice in the last five 
minutes with his deadly pushes to steer Pakistan to an imposing 4-1 
victory over India in the second hockey Test of the nine-match 
series at Aishbagh Stadium in Bhopal on Friday.
    
Abbas, who also scored two goals in Pakistan 4-3 win in the series 
opener on Wednesday, found the cage in the 65th and 69th minutes 
after India had taken an early lead through centre-forward Gagan 
Ajit Singh who breached the Pakistan defence with body swerve to 
slam the board in the second minute.
    
Pakistan drew level three minutes later when Asim Naveed swept the 
ball into the goal following Irfan's defence-splitting pass from 
the right after rasping an angular shot into the cage.
    
After both the teams were on even terms at 1-all at the half-time 
stage, Irfan Yousuf put Pakistan 2-1 ahead with skipper Atif 
Bashir's incisive through the ball from the top of the striking 
circle which went pass Indian custodian Jagdish Ponnappa for Irfan 
to tap the ball into the net.
    
Then came Sohail's two-goal feat. He first sent a firm push past 
the goalkeeper and followed up with a drag-flick into the net.
    
Pakistan put up a vastly improved performance display from the 
tour-opener as right winger Mohammad Irfan and inside-right 
Mohammad Sarwar, later adjudged Man-of-the-Match, created panic in 
the Indian camp by repeatedly showing the home team defenders a 
clean pair of heels.
    
With the mid-fielders playing well inside their own territory, 
India seemed to have left the midfield for Pakistan to command. And 
this seemed to have settled the fate of the match. Pakistan made 
the most of India's reluctance to move up and harried them into 
mistakes, which proved critical. Poor-coordination among the medios 
gave away too many loose balls for India's comfort and offered 
chances to the opportunistic Pakistan strikers.
    
Earlier, both the teams started the second match of the series 
devoid of any rest as they arrived in Bhopal only two hours before 
the scheduled start. The two teams, which were scheduled to arrive 
in Bhopal on Thursday night, couldn=92t reach untill Friday 
afternoon after their flight from New Delhi was refused landing at 
Bhopal because of thick fog. The plane was diverted to Mumbai from 
where it took off his morning.
