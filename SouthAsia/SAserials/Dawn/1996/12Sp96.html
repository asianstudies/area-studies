Our Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 6: As the nation celebrated the Defence of Pakistan Day on 
Friday, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told a rally at the National Stadium 
here that return of normality to Karachi was a great victory for people and 
expressed the resolve to confront the enemies of Pakistan, internal and 
external, with the support of the people.
    
Nothing will be spared to make Pakistan invincible and its defence 
impregnable so that the enemy would not dare cast an evil eye on it, she 
said and urged the people to unite against the enemies of the country.
    
We will confront the enemies of Pakistan with all our might to defend the 
glory and honour of our nation, she declared amid applause.
    
Prime Minister Bhutto said it was a great day in the history of the 
country, particularly for the people of Karachi who three years ago could 
not have thought of holding such a function owing to the worst kind of 
terrorism.
    
I am happy that peace has returned to Karachi and I commend the people 
that by confronting terrorism they have saved Pakistan, said the Prime 
Minister.
    
Referring to her governments efforts for peace and development, she said: 
I dont want to see dead bodies in your homes, I want to see happiness on 
every face.

<a name="pmna">PM, Nawaz exchange proposals for dialogue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi
    
ISLAMABAD, Sept 8: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and opposition leader Mian 
Nawaz Sharif on Sunday exchanged proposals for setting up of an 
accountability commission and initiating a dialogue between the two sides.
    
Speaking in the National Assembly, Nawaz Sharif proposed that a commission 
comprising of senior judges should be set up to probe into allegation of 
corruption against himself and the prime minister.
    
Ms Bhutto, however, suggested that the two sides should first formulate a 
code of conduct before negotiations on constitutional reforms and talks on 
other issues.
    
The opposition leader in his 135 minutes speech refuted charges of non-
payment of loans against his family concern, Ittefaq Foundry, and also 
expressed willingness to present himself for accountability.

He charged Benazir Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari and Hakim Ali Zardari of 
siphoning away over Rs. 3 billion from the nationalised banks and other 
financial institutions.

Regarding the outstanding loans of Rs. 6 billion against Ittefaq group he 
conceded that the group owe the loan. 
    
Ms Benazir Bhutto later responding to the proposal of accountability 
commission said that the representatives of both sides should first sit 
together and chalk out a code of conduct.  
   
She said the government was determined to recover the outstanding and bad 
loans from the defaulter and it would do it with or without the co-
operation of the opposition.

<a name="nawa">Nawazs terms for dialogue with govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 10: Leader of the Opposition Mian Nawaz Sharif has 
expressed his willingness to hold dialogue with the government to 
simultaneously discuss accountability, strengthening of the system and 
immediate elections.
    
But everything should be openly discussed in parliament, he demanded.
    
Speaking at the joint parliamentary party meeting of the opposition here on 
Tuesday, he pointed out that his party wanted to preserve the Constitution 
with certain amendments that were needed according to national 
requirements. The opposition is also prepared to co-operate in the 
formation of a caretaker government to oversee the elections as well as 
appointment of a neutral election commission, he added.
    
Nawaz Sharif opposed the proposal seeking a change in the system. There is 
nothing wrong in the system, he said and blamed the bad governance of 
Benazir Bhutto and her cohorts for all the ills in the country.
    
He also accused the prime minister of looting and plundering the national 
wealth and alleged that she was avoiding the setting up of a judicial 
commission because of being involved in corrupt practices.
    
She is not accepting my demand for the establishment of an independent and 
high-powered judicial commission to start accountability precisely, because 
she herself is involved in corruption, plunder and economic ruin, he 
further alleged.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 7: The United States has allowed Boeing to sell its 
aircraft to PIA and ensured that the Pressler amendment does not hinder the 
deal.
    
The American Import Export Bank will provide credit to PIA to purchase 
Boeing planes and the Pressler amendment would not stand in its way, said 
the visiting US Assistant Secretary of Commerce Mr Raymond E. Vickery Jr.
    
I do not see that the Pressler amendment is a big problem and at the same 
time I do not see it could obstruct business relations between the two 
countries.

<a name="bdin">BD investigates possibility of Pakistans involvement</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Saeed

DHAKA, Sept 8: Investigators in Bangladesh are examining the possibility of 
Pakistan and Libyas involvement in the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur 
Rahman, a newspaper reported on Friday. The English daily, The New Nation, 
quoted sources close to Awami League as saying that secret agencies have 
specific information that Syed Farooq Rashid, one of the two masterminds of 
the killing, and his men illegally imported huge quantity of arms and 
ammunition from a Muslim country in Africa and a big Muslim country in 
Asia.
    
The paper, however, did not name the countries it had mentioned in its 
story, but named Pakistan and Libya in headlines.
    
The killers had also procured a huge quantity of arms from an armed tribal 
group in Chittagong Hill Tracts through a businessman in Chittagong.
    
The paper had earlier reported that the American ambassador to Bangladesh 
and representatives of the Indian government were actively involved in the 
conspiracy.
    
The government of Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, daughter of Mujibur 
Rahman, has revived the case after 21 years and directed the agencies to 
unearth the facts and figures behind the killings.
    
The government arrested Col Rahman and two of his accomplices on Aug. 13 
and immediately constituted a case against killers of Sheikh Mujib, members 
of his family and four of his aides.

<a name="jala">Jalalabad falls to Taliban militia</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ahmad Hassan

PESHAWAR, Sept 11: Jalalabad, the capital of Afghanistans eastern 
Nangarhar province, fell to the Taliban  militia on Wednesday afternoon 
without any resistance from the government forces.
    
The Taliban militia, led by Mulla Borjan, a prominent Taliban commander, 
entered the city at 3:00pm on Wednesday and immediately took its control, 
the sources said.
    
They said the Taliban occupied administration offices and residence of 
Governor Haji Abdul Qadeer who had escaped to Peshawar along with his 
brother and son on Tuesday evening.
    
The sources said the Nangarhar Shura troops either changed loyalties or 
fled the city to avoid a clash with the advancing Taliban column numbering 
only about 1000.
    
With the fall of Jalalabad, second largest city after Kabul, and 
strategically important for being situated on the main highway between 
Peshawar and Kabul, the Taliban are now in full control of the main route 
between Pakistan and the Afghan capital.

The situation on Pakistan-Afghanistan  border remained tense throughout the 
day on Tuesday due to the uncertain condition across the border.

<a name="govt">Govt issues list of loan defaulters</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 5: The federal government on Thursday issued a list of 
major 250 loan defaulters, with the Ittefaq group of Nawaz Sharif on top in 
the private sector and Karachi Development Authority in the public sector.
    
The minister of state for law and parliamentary affairs, Mian Raza Rabbani, 
made the list public at a news conference. He said: The standing committee 
on law and parliamentary affairs which has been entrusted the task of 
recommending ways and means to recover the staggering Rs95 billion from the 
defaulters is expected to propose a new legislation for the purpose. He 
alleged that the Constitution had been tampered with by the dictators and 
said a new legislation was imperative to recover the stuck-up loans.
    
Mr Rabbani said the committee would be totally independent to recommend any 
possible means for the recovery of the loans. One of the members of the 
committee, originally a PML MNA and now the minister for science and 
technology, Haji Nawaz Khokhar, is among the defaulters who had obtained 
Rs361 million but never paid back. When asked how could Mr Khokhar be part 
of the committee as he was a defaulter, Mr Rabbani said he would not like 
to comment on it. When pressed, he said the committee had been set up long 
ago and that he did not know much about it. Riaz Pirzada is chairman of the 
committee and its members include Iftikhar Gilani, Muzaffar Hashmi, Zafar 
Ali Shah, Rafiq Mehsar, Ghulam Farid Kahtia, Naveed Qamar, Mian Yasin 
Wattoo and N.D. Khan.

<a name="valu">Value of rupee lowered by 3.65 pc </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Sept. 10: The State Bank Governor, Dr Mohammad Yaqub, announced on 
Tuesday that the government has decided to lower the exchange rate of rupee 
with dollar by 3.65 per cent. Dollars official buying rate has now been 
increased by Re 1.35. From Monday the new exchange rate has been raised 
from Rs 35.62 to Rs 36.97.
    
It will make exports competitive, curtail imports and encourage overseas 
Pakistanis to remit their earnings through banks as wedge between the 
official exchange rate and kerb rate in open market has been narrowed 
down, the Governor announced at a hurriedly called press conference amid 
strong reports that dollar rate in open market has already escalated beyond 
Rs 40 and was fluctuating somewhere between Rs 40.30 and Rs 40.50. He said 
the action had been taken to strengthen the economy and not to weaken it 
and the purpose is to boost the exports.

The governor offered detailed explanation of the implications of rupee 
devaluation at the very outset.
    
He said there would not be much effect on the priceline of the items being 
consumed by the poor people as their 95 per cent consumption is not related 
to imports. However, Dr Yaqub was found wanting in answers when informed 
that bulk of the quantity of crude oil and petroleum products are being 
imported and a higher import bill would have direct and indirect effect on 
almost all sectors of economy. In addition items worth over two billion 
dollars including edible oil, wheat, tea, powdered milk, and a variety of 
vegetables were being imported which were in the menu of the poorest people 
in the country.

<a name="rupe">Rupee losing trust on account of continual devaluation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

THE ceaseless, creeping devaluation of the rupee is making the people, 
particularly business groups, lose faith in the future of the rupee, and 
that has resulted in a large 10 per cent gap between the official exchange 
rate of Rs 35.62-to-a-dollar and the free market rate of Rs 39.15.
    
Normally the difference has been around five or six per cent, or around Rs 
2 instead of the current Rs 3.53.
   
And that has spawned a great deal of speculation that following the four 
per cent devaluation of the rupee since January 1, there could be a further 
four per cent devaluation before the end of the year, while the wilder 
speculation takes the rupee much further down.
    
The rupee was depreciated officially three times in August and came down by 
a total of 30 paisa to a dollar, and that gave a spur to a further rise in 
free market prices, with the only reassuring news from the government that 
its foreign exchange reserve had gone up to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion 
earlier.
    
With the gap between the official exchange rate of the rupee and the free 
market widening, a great many overseas Pakistanis who send home remittances 
regularly are reported to be holding back their remittances and the people 
in Pakistan who have dollars which they need to dispose of are not doing 
that in the hope of getting more in terms of rupees soon, while others are 
trying to buy more dollars to profit by the expected substantial 
devaluation.

Unhappy experience
    
Pakistans unhappy experience shows that when the government finds exports 
not going up in the manner sought, it comes up with large doses of 
devaluation at a time, like the 10 per cent devaluation in the second half 
of 1993 and the 7 per cent devaluation resorted to on October 28 last to 
appease the IMF which was more keen on a budget deficit reduction on adding 
a large doses of devaluation to the smaller ones which have become a 
constant feature of our economy.
    
What is outrageous about what was done on October 28 was that while other 
countries reduce import duties as they resort to substantial devaluation of 
their currencies, the government came up with a 10 per cent regulatory duty 
on all dutiable items and five per cent on others.
    
Worse has been the impact of the current budget with its additional 
taxation of Rs 41 billion (former finance minister Sartaj Aziz says it is 
in fact Rs 57 billion) which has enhanced the cost of production and 
exports a great deal. The sustained devaluation enhanced the rupee cost of 
all imports and increased the duties on all imports in terms of rupees, 
including industrial raw materials and inputs into exports.
    
The other area where the devaluation of the rupee fails is in restricting 
imports.
    
While devaluation normally makes imports more costly, decreases demand at 
home, and lowers the imports, in Pakistan it tends to increase the imports, 
as happened last year when imports increased to $11.7 billion against the 
previous years $10 billion,  a rise of 12.5 per cent against the targeted 
10.6 per cent.
    
When it comes to exports, after the rupee was devalued by 14.67 per cent in 
1993 instead of exports going up appreciably in 1993-94 they fell by 1.4 
per cent spot-lighting the limitation of large scale devaluation of the 
rupee in boosting exports.
    
In the same manner, despite the 7 per cent devaluation of October 28 last, 
and the creeping devaluation, which preceded that and followed, exports 
increased by 5 five per cent while the growth target was 14 per cent.
    
The Indian and Pakistan rupee have been moving largely along the same level 
in recent years, but now the free market price of the Indian rupee at 
35.70-to-a-dollar is almost the same as the official rate of the Pakistani 
currency35.62, while the free market rate in Pakistan at Rs 39.15-to-a-
dollar is Rs 3.45 ahead of the Indian open market rate.
    
Makhdoom Shahabuddin, Minister of State of Finance, last week categorically 
stated that there would be no devaluation of the rupee. Instead you will 
see the rupee stable by the end of next month. 
   
But then, in the past too categorical official statements of this kind had 
been followed by substantial devaluation. In fact, we cannot expect the 
officials to confirm that there would be devaluation of the rupee sometime 
soon as that would send, the speculators and manipulators in the money 
market on a tail spin and let them foul up the market.

Govts options
    
The government has usually two options to boost exports after setting a 
high export target of $10 billion either to lower the duties and other 
inputs cost of industries and exporters or resort to further devaluation.
    
Clearly, the latter option has proved counter-productive for increasing 
exports except a for a short while immediately after a large devaluation, 
and so the only option left with the government it so reduce the duties and 
other inputs costs of the exporters.
   
However, the government is determined to increase its revenues at any cost 
so as to reduce the budget deficit to 4 per cent of the GDP and get payment 
of two tranches of 80 million dollars under the stand-by agreement for $600 
million.
    
Meanwhile, the government claims its foreign exchange reserve, including 
through short-term borrowing abroad, has risen to $1.8 billion, but a good 
many debt repayments are due in the coming months and that will bring down 
the reserve a great deal.
    
Of course, if the privatisation efforts become a success soon and power 
projects and major banks get sold along with 26 per cent of the shares of 
PTC to a major strategic buyer the reserve can go up appreciably.

Meanwhile, the foreign exchange deposits of resident and overseas 
Pakistanis have gone up to $7 billion dollars, and if in the unsettled 
conditions in Pakistan there is a rush to get back their dollars from the 
banks, the government which has used up all that money will not be able to 
repay that.
    
Of course, some of the large depositors have borrowed against their rupee 
rupees at low interest rates but they own about two-thirds of the total 
deposits only.
    
The others who own more than $2.5 billion would want that money immediately 
as they are encumbered with rupee loans, and the government with its low 
foreign exchange reserve meant for other purposes will find it hard to meet 
their demands. 
   
Hence the government should cease using up all the deposits and treating 
even short-term deposits as its foreign exchange reserve, in the manner 
many countries, including India, are doing.
    
This is an area which needs serious consideration from the government 
instead of the issue being taken lightly and breezily hoping for the best 
in these uncertain times.

<a name="puny">Puny rate of savings impedes our economic growth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Jafar Wafa

THE CONFUCIAN countries of East Asia namely China, Japan, South Korea, Hong 
Kong, Taiwan and Singapore - started their journeys on the road to the 
economic miracle through learning and saving. Compared to our sub-
continent, literacy rates in these countries are as high as 75 per cent, 
excluding Japan where well over 95 per cent people are literate.
   
Their gross domestic savings range between 35-40 per cent of the GDP. High 
literacy rate has produced a balanced frame of mind in citizens of these 
countries. Perhaps, this is why their interest in political polemics is 
minimal. In China, Hong Kong and Taiwan neither elections have ever been 
held, nor the people have any concept of a democratic polity which has been 
bequeathed to the South Asians by the outgoing colonial power. 
   
In other countries of East. Asia like Indonesia, Vietnam, Singapore and 
Malaysia, there is either an autocratic rule or a one-party government. 
There too, the citizens are not political minded. They are economic 
animals, as the late Z.A. Bhutto had so aptly said about the Japanese.
    
In contrast, the literacy rates in South Asian states are as low as 37 to 
50 per cent (36 per cent in Pakistan) with the exception f Sri Lanka where 
it is as high a 90 per cent. Perhaps, this high literacy factor explains 
why there has been no political upheaval of any kind in Sri Lanka. The 
armed hostility to which that country is a prey to is not an internal 
conflict, as is common knowledge, but the acts of Tamil insurgents from 
neighbouring south India. These countries which are characterised by low 
literacy and low savings rates, the teeming millions of destitute are being 
ruled by dynastic leadership, at present mostly women belonging to the 
families of slains political leaders, as in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri 
Lanka. In India, political leadership had mostly been the proud preserve of 
the Nehru dynasty with the redoubtable Indira Gandhi and her son closing 
the dynastic rule. The East Asian countries have become tigers not only 
through literacy but also through re-investment of their high amounts of 
savings in nation-building activities.

It is doubtful if the Pakistanis and other South Asians can save as much 
with the kinds of government they have at present, with the likely 
exception of India where the administration has taken a left turn but 
nevertheless stands on slippery ground.
    
Domestic savings are the highest (44 per cent) in China, a socialist 
republic where the state provides almost free health care, free basic 
education and heavily subsidised transport to urban commuters. The 
Indonesians save as much as 37 per cent and the South Koreans and 
Malaysians nearly 33 per cent of their gross domestic incomes. These rates 
were as low as eight per cent in Indonesia and South Korea and about 24 per 
cent in Malaysia during the sixties when they were not even cubs. In 
Japan, however, the rate 34 per cent has been constant for more than three 
decades of its post-war history.
    
The rate of savings in Pakistan is abysmally low. It is around 13 per cent, 
having slid from about 1t per cent five years ago. How low it is can be 
gauged from the fact that it is far less than 19 per cent in prodigal 
America or 16 per cent in blue-blooded Britain. 
   
Naturally, our rate of investment too has been as low as 19 per cent of GDP 
throughout the nineties, same as in the UK and 3 per cent better than in 
the US the two representative countries from the highly developed Northern 
hemisphere, where domestic investment has already touched the ceiling and 
whose capitalists are seeking propitious places off shore to invest for 
higher return than at home. Our own country is one such propitious place 
for them. So, we can not derive satisfaction from the mere fact that our 
investment rate compares favourably with that in the United States or in 
the United Kingdom as the levels of their economies bear absolutely no 
comparison with ours. If at all comparison must be made, we should again 
look eastward. Against our 19 per cent, the Chinese have lately been 
investing at approximately 40 per cent of the GDP, the Indonesians at 36 
per cent, the Malaysians at 34 per cent and the South Koreans at 37 per 
cent of their national incomes.
    
Our government itself consumes 15 per cent of the available resources 
which, in terms of percentage, is only marginally less than what the 
various tiers of governments of the sole surviving superpower do. How 
spend-thrift and expensive our government is can be realised when we are 
told that the East Asian governments spend only 9 to 10 per cent of the 
total national expenditure on themselves.
    
The rate of private consumption by citizens of these East Asian states 
ranges between 50 to 60 per cent of GDP, allowing a substantial margin for 
investment in industry and infrastructure.
 
Our people have the doubtless distinction of consuming nearly 75 per cent 
of GDP on food, clothing, shelter and other needs, against a little less 
then 70 per cent in neighbouring India, which is far more populous and 
hardly more resourceful, and 18 to 20 per cent in US and UK. 
  
We have to spend nearly 55 per cent, out of their aggregated household 
expenses, on food along; against 50 per cent by the Indians, and as less as 
16, 23 and 35 per cent by the Japanese, Malaysians and South Koreans 
respectively. In US and UK, raw, uncooked food is cheaper than even in 
these East Asian countries. 

Skewed policies
    
This should be food for thought for our feudal-dominated government which 
keeps on enhancing the procurement prices of wheat and sugar, every now and 
then, and potatoes last week, making the staple diet of the masses costlier 
and allowing higher incomes to flow into the coffers of the rich growers 
who devote their energies more to extremely rewarding political pursuits 
than to increasing the productivity of their unmanageably huge land 
holdings. 
   
These landed gentry, according to an estimate, own 70 per cent of the 
arable land on which eight million peasants toil hard to cultivate food 
grains and cash crops. The successive governments, including the popularly-
elected ones, have failed miserably to restrict human procreation, through 
effective and pragmatic planned-family programmes, and to increase farm 
production through effective land reforms.
    
If people spend more than half of their earnings on feeding themselves and 
their large families, they can hardly save enough to invest in domestic 
industry and infrastructure, which is a prerequisite for foreign 
investment. 
  
And if the government spends prodigally on its own parliamentary 
paraphernalia and jumbo cabinet, it can hardly find enough resources to 
spread literacy and sponsor research and development schemes in 
universities and specialised institutions of higher learning.
    
Without learning and saving, as the East Asians have proved, the country 
is bound to enter the next year (not next century) with a bigger begging 
bowl in hand and a bloated, top heavy, wasteful government on its back.

<a name="fore">Foreign investors and special incentives</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
R.M.U. Suleman

LATE last month, Syed Mohibullah Shah, Secretary of the Board of Investment 
(BoI) held a Press briefing to recount Pakistans recent achievements in 
attracting direct foreign investment and the problems encountered in doing 
so. Earlier in the day, there was a review and decisions making meeting of 
the Board presided over by its chairman, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
    
Many projects were approved. Engro PVC plant is to be set up in 
collaboration with Mitsubishi of Japan. Pharma plants are to be set up with 
concessional customs duty of 10 per cent on imported machinery and raw 
materials. Import levies on hotel items were reduced from 65 per cent to 25 
per cent. Pakistan has also improved the incentive package for the food 
industry.
    
Direct foreign investment (DFI) during 1995-96 was reported to be $1.1 
billion as compared to $442 million of 1994-95, an annual jump of about 149 
per cent. A reverse trend was observed in portfolio investments which 
dipped by 75 per cent from $1.0 billion in 1994-95 to $250 million in 1995-
96. Portfolio investments in 1994-95 were inflated by overseas sales of 10 
per cent of PTC vouchers. The decline in portfolio investment is also 
explained by persistent bearish pressures on our stock exchanges.
    
If both, the DFI and portfolio investments are added up, the total shows a 
decline of 6.3 per cent from $1.442 billion in 1994-95 to $1.350 billion in 
1995-96. In 1993-94 the total investments received were $649 million. In 
the 1980s the total foreign investment flow was at a much lower rate of 
$100 million per annum.
    
All these figures are based on BoIs departmental records and may differ 
slightly from the records of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). These 
numbers are, of course, not mere MoUs but funds verifiable from the SBP. 
They are usually tied up with foreign equipment and supplies needed for the 
fuel and power sectors.
    
Mohibullah Shah informed newsmen that 30 per cent of the investment was 
made in the energy sector, while the remaining went to transport, 
communications, agriculture and trading. As to the sources of DFI, the 
leading investing countries in 1995-96 were the United States ($319 
million),the United Kingdom ($317 million) and the other European 
countries. The new non-traditional foreign investors during the year were 
from Japan ($50 million), Hong Kong ($40 million) and the United Arab 
Emirates ($40 million).
   
Zardaris assurance Mr Shah also added in this context that Pakistan had 
also received a good response from South Korean investors and expressed the 
hope that a significant investment would be coming from that country in the 
near future. Federal Minister for Investment Asif Ali Zardari has assured 
the visiting delegation of Daewoo that the policy guideline to attract 
investment in Pakistan is based on No bureaucratic bottlenecks, with 
smooth and congenial conditions. The delegation is visiting Pakistan to 
explore new ventures for investment in the field of highways, hotels, 
railways, petrochemical, telecommunication, agro- based industry, tourism 
etc.
    
Zardari emphasised that it was fair to provide incentives to the investor 
who brings in technology and the investors should invest in manufacturing 
rather than trading. He advised government officials to provide land to 
the interested parties as a part of equity. He also apprised the delegation 
about the export potential if they invest in Pakistan. Pakistan has a vast 
market around the Central Asian Republics (CARs) and the middle east.
    
The Chairman Daewoo group, Mr Chong Young Soo appreciated that with the 
restoration of peace in Karachi, Pakistan has become a more attractive 
destination for the investors. He expressed willingness to participate in 
the privatisation of PTCL and the nationalised commercial banks. The desire 
to open a new bank in the private sector was expressed.

Uncompetitive

Mr Shah went on to add that the cost of capital was raised by inefficient 
banking system and the rising cost of utilities. These factors were making 
Pakistan uncompetitive in the region and keeping the foreign investors 
away.
    
The cost of investment is related to the cost of capital (the rate of 
interest) and the cost of utilities. Due to inefficiency of our banking 
system, the over-loading of deposit rate for the borrower at eight per cent 
as compared with 1.5 per cent in most developed, East Asian and south-east 
Asian countries.
    
Another factor, Mr Shah emphasised, was the withdrawal of the special 
industrial zones (SIZs) package, which the government had offered to 
foreign investors but had rolled back on the pressure of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF). Shah said the BoI was working for the revival of these 
special industrial zones to create competitiveness.
    
Only in eleven months, ie before this package was withdrawn, Pakistan 
received project proposals worth $20 billion as against only $200 million 
worth projects attracted by the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in the last 14 
years. Conceptually, of course, SIZs and the EPZs zones are quite 
different. The former represents an effort at decentralised 
industrialisation backed by outright tax concessions. Such 
industrialisation is often based on tax concessions and provision of 
industrial infrastructure and the adjoining areas are also cultivated as 
the market for the product of such industrialisation. Such zones add 
substantially to the budgetary imbalance and could thus hardly be to the 
liking of IMF.
    
EPZs, on the other hand operate as enclaves. Goods produced there are meant 
almost entirely for the export market, without bearing any burden of export 
levies. Domestic raw material entering the enclaves have to pay export 
duties, if leviable. Goods manufactured in the enclave can also be sold in 
the domestic market but after bearing the burden of all import levies.
    
The BoI had been arguing with the IMF that Pakistan was losing its 
competitiveness because of the withdrawal of the package of incentives for 
SIZs. If we want to bring foreign investment, we will have to give 
investors special incentives, particularly when we lack infrastructure, 
have a poorly qualified labour force along with high input cost of capital 
and utilities, he maintained.
    
If we had stuck to this package, in a period of five years, new industrial 
towns would have sprung up all over the country, creating job opportunities 
and releasing pressure on the cities. This, however, is quite a romantic 
view since the link between modern industries and mega cities is quite 
organic.
    
Nevertheless, Pakistan was working hard to achieve an annual foreign 
investment of around $5 billion by the turn of the present century. This 
would mean an impressive quantum jump from Rs 1.1 billion in DFI received 
in 1995-96.
    
In order to provide better services to the foreign investors, five senior 
officers - one each from Customs, Income Tax, Water and Power, PTC, and 
Immigration and Passports - are being appointed to the BoI. They will 
represent the departments that the foreign investors are most concerned 
with.
    
Portfolio investment in 1994-95 were on the higher side because of the 
privatisation of state-run PTC. If we consider the PTC aspect, the 
portfolio investment has remained unchanged during the last fiscal year, 
Shah said, adding that another factor was that the stock markets had also 
not been so vibrant during that period. 
   
Pakistan would be actively participating in the talks being held on 
multilateral investment agreement between the developed and the developing 
countries to project its view point. We will be consulting other 
developing countries before these talks.
    
Pakistan should compare its foreign investors incentive package with those 
of East and South East Asian countries. A multilateral dialogue between the 
developed and the developing countries on the question of Incentive 
packages should be welcomed. Even the World Trade Organisation (WTO) may be 
requested to take initiative in this matter. It will be best to evolve a 
broad consensus before taking up the whole issue with the IMF.
    
Pakistan needs to be worried by the fact that no significant foreign 
investment has so far been received in the manufacturing sector, 
particularly for export oriented goods. DFI like foreign aid involves 
reverse flows which usually expand with time and can reduce the net flow to 
a mere trickle. The net inflow of foreign aid is a bare 16 per cent of the 
gross inflow.
    
It is important to prepare five-yearly projections of inflows as well as 
outflows of DFI on medium as well as long term basis. In the absence of 
such projections, the country may be caught short without any warning. 
There are no indication of BoI having yet applied its mind to such 
problems.
    
There is also a need to examine the investment-export-growth nexus so 
common in developing countries. Such studies carried out in other 
developing countries provide overwhelming support to the proposition that 
the investment ratio plays the key role in determining inter-country 
differences in both growth and export performance. 
  
The so-called efficiency of resource use which undergirds Fund-Bank 
advocacy is of no relevance in this regard. No increase in the growth rate 
can possibly occur unless the investment ratio is substantially raised.

<a name="exte">External debt stands at $29.57bn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 7: Pakistan is the 18th most indebted country in the world 
with its total external debt standing at a staggering 29.57 billion 
dollars, according to the recently released World Debt Tables.
    
The debt was equal to 56.6 per cent of the GNP, while the debt service 
liability of Pakistan constituted a high 34.7 per cent of her exports on 
the basis of the statistics pertaining to 1994. In terms of debt service 
payment also, Pakistans position is 18th in the list of 136 countries that 
are DRS (Debtor Reporting System of the World Bank) economies.
    
As an earner of foreign exchange, Pakistan ranks 23rd from the top. 
Strangely, however, the report by the World Bank has placed Pakistan among 
15 countries in the category Moderately indebted low-income countries 
which also includes Nepal, Bangladesh and India.
    
According to the report, the total debt of developing countries, rising by 
8 per cent, reached $2,068 billion at the end of 1995, up $147 billion from 
1994. The over-all increase in developing country debt was mainly due to a 
jump in net debt flows stemming from continued and expanding access to 
private market financing by credit-worthy borrowers and to the exceptional 
package for Mexico.
    
The total debt outstanding of South Asia in 1995 increased from $161 
billion to $168 billion in 1995. This is 8 per cent of the outstanding 
external debt of all low- and middle-income countries combined. It also 
includes credit by World Bank/IDA to the tune of $43.5 billion. The region 
received 5 per cent of aggregate flows to low- and middle-income countries 
and 10 per cent of official flows.
    
Bangladesh, India and Pakistan together hold 90 per cent of the regions 
outstanding debt, with India by far the largest borrower (60 per cent).

<a name="ptcl">PTCL sale to hit govt revenue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 8 : The Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs has 
expressed its fear that the privatisation of Pakistan Telecommunication 
Company Limited (PTCL) may lead to decline in government revenues and also 
harm the interest of its employees.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here on Sunday that the officials of the 
ministry had prepared a summary on the implications of privatisation of the 
PTCL for consideration of the Federal Cabinet.

It said the T&T Department and the PTC were profit earning organisations. 
On privatisation of these, the revenue of the government was expected to 
decline. This aspect must be kept in mind before taking any final decision, 
the ministry stated.  Then there will be more than one license in the 
private sector to provide telephone facilities. It, was therefore, 
necessary to give full autonomy to the telecommunications regulatory 
authority that there should be an independent regulatory body for 
regulating the licences, monitoring of their operations, fixation of tariff 
etc. in the public interest.
    
On privatisation, interests of the employees of the T&T Department and the 
Corporation must not suffer. These employees were entitled to pension like 
other government servants who were likely to lose their jobs when 
telecommunication system is transferred to a private investor without 
proper safeguards.

<a name="stoc">Stocks suffer widespread decline</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 10: Stocks suffered widespread decline on Tuesday after the 
news of four per cent devaluation of the rupee reached the rings as bears 
indulged in haste selling fearing a massive sell-off.
    
Stocks are always allergic to any devaluation as it significantly erodes 
their competitive edge and cheaper shares have no real value, said a 
leading stock analysts.
    
He said what was more disturbing was that it came at time when the market 
has already hit the bottom and there were fears of its imminent collapse. 
Massive devaluations as the one witnessed on Tuesday gives bears an extra 
leverage, which they use according to their whims without taking into 
account its total impact, he added.
    
What was more important was that it works against the interests of foreign 
investors who are already on their way out owing to the protracted bearish 
spell, dealers said.

Floor brokers said the crisis period for the market is not still over but 
rather it should expect further jolts in the wake of current devaluation as 
foreign investors might think twice to re-enter the rings.
    
There is a total confusion in the rings and no one could really decide how 
to react to the changed financial scenario, they added.
    
It was perhaps in this background that a record final dividend of 290 per 
cent for the year ended June 30, 1996 by the directors of the Brooke Bond 
Pakistan failed to inspire new buying on the blue chip counters. However, 
its share value rose Rs 14.50 at Rs 151 for a 10-rupee share, with 1,300 
shares changing hands.
    
The directors have already paid an interim dividend of 125 per cent or Rs 
12.50 per share, which brought the total to 415 per cent a new record for 
any share.
    
A 20 per cent cash dividend from Punjab Modaraba and an interim dividend of 
10 per cent from the directors of Highnoon Lab were also on the higher side 
of the market expectations but they came at a time when the market was 
facing some other problems. 
   
Leading shares, therefore, fell further under the lead of PSO, which 
suffered sharp decline of Rs 12, sending shock waves on other blue chip 
counters.
    
It was followed by MNCs such as Engro Chemicals, Telecard, Shell Pakistan, 
Fauji Fertiliser, Knoll Pharma and Lever Brothers, falling by Rs 2 to 5. 
Among the locals, 4th ICP, MCB, ICP SEMF, Pakland cement, KESC, Nishat Tek, 
and Lucky Cement were leading losers.
    
Apart from Brooke Bond, other notable gainers were led by Atlas Lease, 
Ahmed Spinning, Kohat Cement and Pakistan House International rising by one 
rupee to Rs 2. The most active list was again led by PTC vouchers, off 50 
paisa on 7.336m shares, followed by Hub-Power, lower 10 paisa on 3.596m, 
Dewan Salman, off 80 paisa on 1.282m, Fauji Fertiliser, down Rs 1.85 on 
1.518m, and Nishat Tek, off Rs 1.80 on 0.346m shares.
    
Other actives were led by NDLC, easy 20 paisa on 0.302m, Lucky cement, off 
one rupee on 0.320m, Dhan Fibre, up 10 paisa on 0.284m and MCB, off Rs 1.25 
on 0.237m shares. There were some other notable deals also.
    
Trading activity rose to 21.101m shares from the previous 11.828m shares 
owing to large volume in PTC. There were 283 actives, out of which 151 
shares fell, while 55 rose, with 77 holding on to the last levels.
    
Later in the computerised trading, the KSE 100-share index fell by another 
1.19 points at 1,330.95, while all the three shares, which came in for 
trading finished with an extended decline under the lead of Fauji 
Fertiliser, which fell 75 paisa on 13,500 shares.

<a name="gene">General Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

HISTORY is not being taught in our schools today, neither as a compulsory 
nor an optional subject. Those schools that follow the syllabus of the 
Government Board of Secondary Education have to teach in the 9th and 10th 
(the last two classes) what is termed Pakistan studies.
   
This includes a bit of this and a bit of that, including scrappy geography, 
civics (whatever that may be), politics and whatever history of the world 
and of Pakistan the government of the day feels it is desirable to impart 
to its future citizens.
    
We know that today the children are simply taught that it was General Yahya 
Khan who was responsible for the loss of East Pakistan. We do not know how 
many of them learn that Yahya, having accepted full responsibility as 
former President, Chief Martial Law Administrator and commander of the 
countrys armed forces after he was deposed asked repeatedly, right up to 
his dying day, that he be tried for treason, that he be court-martialled 
and that he be given a public hearing before the Hamoodur Rahman 
Commission.
    
Yahya (PA 98), known to be a good soldier, was commissioned on August 26, 
1938, from the Indian Military Academy Dehra Dun, as the Kings cadet, 
Hissam Effendi winning the sword of honour, and Yahyas lifelong friend, 
Abdul Hamid Khan (Burmese Hamid) passing out the same term.
    
At the age of 34, Yahya was the youngest brigadier in the Pakistan Army. 
made commander-in-chief in September 1966 by Ayub Khan, he was renowned 
neither for his sobriety nor for his academic astuteness, but he did have a 
high IQ. Nevertheless, he was no match for the guile and gall of Mujibur 
Rahman and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who manipulated him with ease in 1971.
    
Just before he died in August 1980, 16 years ago, Yahya handed over his 
files and some video cassettes to his son, Ali, with words that still ring 
in his ears: Redeem my honour if you can, but dont get yourself killed 
doing so.
    
Yahya was not corrupt. He did not acquire plots, he did not sell arms, 
neither did he sell himself. Ali today is one of the poorest sons of a 
former C-in-C or COAS of our army. Ali did nothing with the papers handed 
over to him, perhaps for want of help and wherewithal. He was a junior 
executive in Burmah Oil Co when Yahya was removed from power, and ten days 
after Bhutto took over, Jimmy Midwood, the CEO of BOC sent for him and 
regretfully told him that he had no option but to sack him as he had 
received orders to do so from the Presidents secretariat.
    
Lawyer Aristoon Basit of Lahore, who read law at Yale (1963-68), pleads in 
high falutin Urdu before a judge fluent in English, Sindhi, Pashto or 
Punjabi but whose Urdu is definitely a second if not a third language, and 
in fluent English before a judge whose English is somewhat shaky. He is the 
editor of Legal Opinion, a quarterly published from Lahore, and a sponsor-
director of four Idaras of unpronounceable nomenclature.
    
Basit has now compiled a book The Breaking of Pakistan, containing papers 
written by Yahya in which he describes the interaction between him, Bhutto 
and Mujib that led to the disintegration of the country. Most of these 
papers were those submitted by Yahya to the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, 
plus other sworn statements and affidavits. In his introduction, he 
explains:
    
Yahya thinks that it was the Mujib-Bhutto interaction which broke 
Pakistan. Indeed, he puts the major share of the blame on Z. A. Bhutto, the 
minority leader, who insisted to be treated as equal to the majority 
leader. Between these covers the reader will find Yahyas perception on the 
subject. He is obsessed with the theme that a congruence of objectives 
had emerged between Bhutto and Mujeeb pursuant to which East Pakistan 
garrison was made to surrender to seal the fate of united Pakistan. Even in 
his Commission Statement he persistently suggests that Pakistans war 
effort was sabotaged from within, particularly on 3.12. 71 when the pre-
emptive strike ordered by him was deliberately made to abort. Having 
pointed it out repeatedly he wrote quite self-consciously, I regret again 
that it is not in my power to overcome my obsession.
    
In explicit terms Yahya has accused Bhutto of having worked systematically 
for the expulsion of East Pakistan from the Federation as he wanted to 
acquire power at all costs. As Yahya narrates the events from the inside, 
Bhuttos position of Idhar ham, udhar tum, acquires a sinister 
significance at the juncture it was adopted. Bhutto had repeatedly 
suggested to Yahya either to arrange for the secret murder of Mujib while 
in jail custody or to order his execution on an ante-dated order.
    
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was a power-hungry person who exploited the social 
climbers techniques of projecting special relationship with the Army 
Brass. He was a narcissist with a tendency to megalomania as well as 
intrigue. He had no commitment to any doctrine or to Pakistan. He 
manufactured his own charisma without any ethical scruples.
    
Sheikh Mujib was a greedy and immature person who never outgrew the role 
of an agitator student leader. Indians had bribed him to launch an anti-
Pakistan movement in East Pakistan to which extent the allegations in the 
Agartala Conspiracy case were true. They had also implanted a phobia in his 
mind that even if he were to win a general election and become the prime 
minister real power will not be transferred by the Pakistan Army.
    
Throughout the tenure of his military dictatorship, 1969-71, Zulfikar 
Bhutto had been intriguing to oust Yahya and take over power with the 
connivance of, inter alia, General Gul Hassan and Air Marshal Rahim Khan.
    
Yahya started his commission report: .... There was no price I was not 
willing to pay for preserving the integrity of Pakistan. I knew I could 
only get what I wanted from East Pakistani leaders and not West Pakistan 
leadership. It is for the Commission to assess how wrong I have been ... 
Today is 18th January 1972. This day I have received a letter No. 6-ICW/72 
dated 11th January 1972 from Mr Justice Hamoodur Rahman, the Chief Justice 
of Pakistan. I am living at the Forest Dak Bungalow, Banni, a hot and humid 
place near Kharian Cantonment. My abode is quite a bit removed from the 
Grand Trunk Road. I am required to give my statement not later than January 
24, 1972, in other words, within six days. Notwithstanding the constraints 
of time, I value the opportunity to tell my side of the story for whatever 
it be worth. I also feel reassured by the fact that the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan is at the head of this Commission and that he is a Calcutta 
Bengali by ethnic origin.
    
He also filed a writ petition in the Lahore High Court (1649/78) from which 
I quote one excerpt: ..... . It would not be proper for me to say anything 
derogatory about this lady (Mst Akleem Akhtar of Gujrat, nicknamed General 
Rani) who had been introduced to me by Zulfikar Bhutto himself as his 
godmother.  Basit has not printed the eight-page questionnaire sent by 
Hamoodur Rahman, but Ali Yahya has it and has shown it to me. Reading it, I 
could not help but recall the story doing the rounds after WW2. A German 
concentration camp commander, Oberststurmbahnfuhrer Franz-Ernst von 
Stubelchen und Stiffleinberg, assembled all the Jews in the camp. Today is 
der Fuhrers birthday, he announces. In honour of the great day, I am to 
pose you questions. Choose one man from your ranks to answer. If he answers 
them all correctly, you are all free to leave. But should he fail to answer 
even one, you are all consigned to the gas chamber. Samuel Fiegelbaumsohn 
stepped forward. First question: Which crack Atlantic liner sank before the 
outbreak of the Frist World War? The Titanic, came the answer. Gut, how 
many funnels did she have? Four. Sehr gut, how many passengers did she 
carry? 1,308. Gut, gut, and how many lives were lost? 815. Right, and what 
were their names?  Basit says that the entire first edition of 5,000 of his 
books was sold. He feels that a certain party has bought the whole lot. 
Good for Basit. He should print a second edition of a further 5,000. The 
other Yahya, who survives, is shown in Basits book in not too good a 
light. I suggest he find himself a copy and read it.
    
The picture you see is that of Yahya as he looked when he joined the IMA. 
Some may even mistake him for his son Ali, who has now been encouraged to 
print The Yahya Khan Papers.

<a name="thed">The democrat at home</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafizur Rahman

A PROMINENT political personality has advised the younger generation (for 
the umpteenth time, I think) to protect and preserve our traditional moral 
values. He didnt say it, but he could have added that since we, the older 
generation, have failed to do anything about these values, we might as well 
shift the responsibility on to the young.
    
What is the easiest thing in the world? Yes, you are right: to give free 
advice. Since our leaders are doing it all the time, and whatever bilge 
they utter has somehow got to be reported, journalists are always on the 
lookout for suitable synonyms in this regard. Advised, exhorted, called 
upon, appealed, recommended, advocated, warned, counselled, cautioned  
these are the verbs most used in our newspaper stories reporting speeches 
and statements.
    
Moral and ethical values is a beautifully vague expression. Nobody in 
Pakistan has been able to define them, especially when they are also 
traditional and hoary. Therefore, leaving them aside for the present, let 
us look at what we are doing to protect and preserve democracy which is an 
almost palpable experience and involves such high principles as tolerance 
and all the values that we shout about so much, so often.
    
A politician comes home from a meeting where he has been talking about the 
blessings of democracy and the absolute need for a democratic way in 
politics. His sincerity is without doubt. But look what happens as soon as 
he doffs the mantle of politician and dons that of husband and father.
    
The audience changes from political colleagues and followers to the wife 
and children and the servants. All of a sudden the dedicated democrat is 
transformed into a hard-headed autocrat, even a dictator, accustomed to 
having his every word obeyed without demur because he is the head of the 
family.
    
Day in and day out we lecture people on the need for democracy in our 
political dealings with the opposition and those who differ with us. 
Experts, teachers, editors and government leaders are at pains to inculcate 
the democratic spirit of tolerance in students and young people. There is 
incessant talk of the need to acquire and apply the democratic approach for 
solving all our problems.
    
Of course all this is said and done in blatant disregard of the obvious 
yawning gap between precept and practice. But who am I to suspect peoples 
intentions? I take them at their word when they proclaim pontifically that 
democracy should prevail in every walk of life.
    
And yet prevail it does not. Because we have decided that it is only in 
politics that democracy is required in order to achieve a harmonious 
balance between ambition and tolerance. Otherwise in our private daily life 
everyone of us wants things done according to his wishes, his lights, his 
opinions.
    
Take the average head of an average family. Normally the father who, 
because he provides the money, calls the shots. He rules the home like an 
absolute monarch, with the queen agreeing with most of his whims and 
fancies. Together they believe that they have to run their childrens lives 
for them, howsoever old and intelligent the boys and girls may be.
    
They firmly believe that even if their offspring are forty years old, 
married and earning their living, they, the parents, must always remain 
wiser than they  all-knowing. The parents may be near-morons, the children 
may be near-geniuses, but the syndrome will hold good.
    
If the sons and daughters so much as whisper the desire to differ, the 
father will threaten to throw them out of the house (economic blackmail) 
while the mother will utter weird oaths like May you see my dead face! 
and Ill never bless you the milk I fed you! (emotional blackmail).
    
By the way, this last is the most stupid, selfish and meaningless oath I 
have ever heard, and implies that the mother is putting a price on her 
milk.
    
A daughter wishes to marry the man of her choice. The prospective young man 
may be the ideal one available. But just because the democrat father was 
not initially involved, he must oppose the match. It is just like saying, 
Nobody will vote against my wishes. I will tell you who you must vote 
for. The politician will never do this in politics, but the home is a 
different turf altogether. Here there is no place for democracy.
    
A son has no aptitude for science or mathematics. He knows that if he goes 
on with these subjects in college he will fail and make a mess of his 
education. But his democrat father has set his heart on engineering as a 
career for him. So the poor boy must carry on against his own better 
judgement, against his personal inclination.
    
Marriage and a vocation in life are very important matters. But even in 
making minor choices the will of the parent or parents must hold sway. A 
child does not like tomatoes, but must be made to eat them because they 
make blood. (Of all the silly notions!) No matter if the poor kid throws 
up.
    
The children will not be allowed to meet Uncle So-and-So or Aunt Such-and-
Such just because they and the parents have been at loggerheads over some 
trivial quarrel which took place twenty years ago and which makes no sense 
now. Other curbs on the children are predicated by the reason: I have said 
so and thats the end of it. No other explanation is considered necessary. 
Thats democracy for you.
    
How can one be a real democrat unless one allows the principles of 
democracy and mutual respect for differing personal opinion to rule ones 
life in everything that one does? My thesis is that you have first to be a 
democrat in your own home, in your mohalla, and your city before you can 
claim to be a champion of democracy at the national level, or even dream of 
contributing to democracy at a still higher plane. That can come only by 
giving everybody the right to have an opinion of their own, by recognising 
that right and by fighting for it.

<a name="dawn">The dawning of a belated wisdom</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

WHAT was said about the Bourbons  that they forgot nothing and learnt 
nothing  applies equally well to Ms Benazir Bhutto. If she studied history 
at Oxford, she should be taking time off from her current zeal for 
stentorianism and apply herself a bit to the study of the 1977 movement 
against her father. If there is one overriding lesson to be culled from 
this study, it is that Mr Bhutto in that summer of long ago did too little, 
too late. Reputedly a master of political timing, he was always one or two 
steps behind time.
    
Ms Bhutto is doing exactly the same thing now. Elementary political sense 
should have told her not to cross swords with the Chief Justice, not 
because this would have violated any canons of propriety or 
constitutionalism but because it would have been against her political 
interests. But having been driven by her prejudices rather than anything 
better into the maws of this encounter, the next best thing she could have 
done was to live with the Supreme Court judgement that on March the 20th 
delivered a sharp rap on the wrists of her government. Any politician worth 
his salt takes defeat and victory in his stride. Ms Bhutto took her reverse 
badly and spared no occasion to ridicule the Supreme Court. Full six months 
later she is retracing her steps and making peace overtures to the Chief 
Justice. The hapless judges who were the objects of her ill-judged 
munificence are now being made to divest themselves of their tattered robes 
of office. A welcome dawning of wisdom but a bit late in the day.
    
Consider this next example. Ever since being returned to power in 1993 Ms 
Bhutto has had no decent truck or liaison with the other side of Pakistans 
two-party system, the PML(N). In urging some understanding to be struck 
between the two sides, newspapers have run out of ink and cliches. But to 
all these urgings Ms Bhutto turned a deaf ear, arrogant in her belief that 
the opposition had run out of steam and ideas and that her own grip on 
power was secure. Now that the waters seem to be closing in on her, she has 
changed her tune and has started referring to Mian Nawaz Sharif as a 
partner in democracy, with a stake as great as hers in preserving the 
system and in foiling the designs of unholy adventurers. A similar tune 
played eight months ago would have been interpreted as a gesture of 
moderation and statesmanship. Coming in the midst of a crisis whose effects 
are buffeting her government, this new stance of peace, even if it should 
be examined closely by the opposition, is bound to be viewed as an instance 
of opportunism dictated by desperation.
    
Or consider the newly-discovered zeal to go after bank defaulters. The 
lists now being published would have had a far greater impact had they 
come, and corresponding action taken, when the country was being rent by 
cries that the greed and corruption of the high and mighty and 
mismanagement generally were knocking the bottom out of the economy. Mr 
Bhuttos Islamisation measures undertaken in April 1977 (again born out of 
desperation) did not stem the surging tide against him. The lists of 
defaulters coming out now are not going to cleanse her governments image 
or convince a people schooled in cynicism that after the corruption and 
mayhem of the last three years the country is poised to enter a new era of 
rectitude and integrity.
    
The point, however, is that even if Ms Bhutto is guilty of the sin of the 
Bourbons, nothing that she has done today is in the least surprising. As 
T.E. Lawrence writes in the very beginning of his Seven Pillars of 
Wisdom, Some of the evil of my tale may have been inherent in our 
circumstances. What Benazir Bhutto stands charged with today was inherent 
in her circumstances. She was not an untried quantity in 1993. The nation 
had had ample experience of her ways and of the proclivities of her 
followers when the PPP under her command strode to victory in 1988. It was 
not just that her enemies conspired against her and left her with no peace. 
Through her own inexperience, and at the hands of her own tastes and 
prejudices, she also became her own worst enemy. Thus, much before her 
dismissal her performance stood condemned in the public eye.
    
In 1993 when circumstances or rather the ill-luck of her enemies allowed 
her to stage a comeback, what the nation saw was not the return of a 
revivified prophetess, her ideas crystallised in the wilderness, but 
someone whose moods, talents and blind spots were fully known to her 
audience. People do grow with age but barring miracles pygmies do not 
become giants and Chamberlains are not suddenly transformed into 
Churchills. What we are now seeing of this shining order could thus easily 
have been foretold. Nor did Ms Bhutto disappoint her critics. Some of the 
egregious blundering of her first term in office was avoided but the basic 
pattern was repeated: power in the hands of a kitchen cabinet and the same 
heedless regard for the consequences of corruption.
    
Now that the expected has come to pass, the question is where do we go from 
here? A Caesarean operation has both its strong advocates and its 
attractions but it still begs many questions. Who will bring it about and 
how? And, considering our history, where is the guarantee that it will not 
create more problems than it will solve?
    
In the heat of enthusiasm that is building up in favour of Caesareanism let 
us not forget that precisely the same arguments that are being marshalled 
today were being echoed in 1990 when pressure grew to dismiss Benazir 
Bhutto from the prime ministership or in 1993 when the army of malcontents, 
which in those days used to wind its way to the Presidency every day, was 
urging Ghulam Ishaq to dismiss Nawaz Sharif. Pakistani history has a habit 
of repeating itself. It is being repeated again except that a growing body 
of opinion has convinced itself that the consequences and the results this 
time will be different. While it is entirely possible for this view to be 
right, a measure of scepticism is still in order if only because we have 
been too many times down this road before.
    
If there is any merit in the Eighth Amendment Constitution (vastly 
different in spirit and texture from the original 1973 Constitution) it is 
that it gives the country a system of checks and balances. If a chief 
executive is allowing himself too much rope, then the other cogs in this 
system are not doing their duty. For instance, now that efforts are afoot 
to patch up matters with the Supreme Court, it is reasonable to assume 
that, among other factors, the President too has used his influence or his 
annoyance to bring this needless crisis to a satisfactory conclusion. But 
at the same time it can also be argued that if the President had asserted 
himself a bit more in the beginning  as, for example, when it was well 
within his powers not to confirm the jiala judges just a day before the 
supreme court verdict in the Judges Case  things might not have reached 
the pass that they eventually did. Again, if the President had not gone 
along with the gung-hoism which led to the ouster of the Sabir Shah 
government in the Frontier, the long train of events leading to the 
exacerbation of differences between the government and the opposition might 
have been averted.
    
The moral of the story is that even without resorting to the kind of 
drastic measures that are currently being advocated, the President can 
assert himself more and bring the government to its senses. We have seen 
the salutary effects of pressure on Ms Bhutto. Had she not been in a 
corner, she would not have been extending olive branches to Mian Nawaz 
Sharif or suddenly discovering in herself an enthusiasm against defaulting 
loans. We have seen a hyper-active Prime Ministers office over the last 
three years. It is now time for the President to take a close look at the 
powers of review (but not of dismissal) which are his to exercise under the 
Eighth Amendment.
    
He can easily put the government under notice that financial shenanigans 
will not be allowed. Why, for instance, cannot the Presidency and the army 
between them finally scotch the incipient Mirage deal in its tracks? 
Thirty-two aircraft for four billion dollars. Before the President thinks 
of stepping into de Gaulles shoes, let him prove himself by putting an end 
to this kind of nonsense. And while he is at it he could also curtail the 
baronial pomp of the Presidents office, and not repeat the practice of 
which he has been guilty in the past of fulfilling the obligations of his 
own piety at public expense. So far the government has presumed upon the 
Presidents unwavering support. Let him show that this presumption is 
unfounded and then if nothing ensues he can think of the next step. But one 
thing at a time, please.
    
If people are fed up with the existing state of affairs, and if they have 
lost hope in their established leaders, no one should be under any illusion 
that their hopes are centred on the Presidency. Sardar Farooq Leghari must 
win his spurs first in smaller endeavours before presuming upon the 
nations goodwill and understanding if his heart finally tells him that the 
time has come for him to move on to bigger things.

ISLAMABAD: A day starting with an almost 4 per cent devaluation of the 
rupee is bound to prove ugly for any incumbent government. Add to that the 
perception of its shying away from a process of fiscal accountability and 
the net result is a sheepish silence. And a subdued treasury was what 
Tuesdays proceedings were all about.
    
The opposition must love it. Every day one opposition stalwart or another 
gets up and hammers away at the government for its incomprehensible 
aversion to the formation of a judicial accountability commission. Instead 
of hitting back with some logical arguments all that the government has to 
offer are rather lame sounding excuses such as, certain laws are already 
there to achieve the same results, or the competent courts are there. 
The latest favourite is refer to the house committee on law which is 
already dealing with the issue of loan defaulters, an excuse forwarded by 
the interior minister once again after Asfandyar Wali had boxed in the 
treasurys ears over the commission issue, yet again.
    
Asfandyar made observations which unquestionably echoed the silent thoughts 
of the ordinary citizens. If the government and the prime minister had 
nothing to hide, why were they afraid of forming such a commission, 
specially when the leader of the opposition has already offered himself as 
the first lamb at the slaughter altar of accountability? he asked testily.
    
The only response that he got from ministers Raza Rabbani and Gen 
Naseerullah Babar, however, was for the opposition to go talk to the house 
committee on law and justice which had already been entrusted with the task 
of suggesting legal amendments to make the top loan defaulters cough up 
their loans. Like in most other instances, the government loyalists had 
once again missed the point altogether.
    
To begin with, the terms of reference of the house committee are entirely 
different from the oppositions demand of a judicial commission. The 
committee is to come up with desired changes in the law to ensure a 
speedier recovery process of funds from loan defaulters whereas what the 
opposition has been clamouring for is a transparent accountability, first 
of the parliamentarians and then of the top civil-military bureaucracy. But 
the even more important aspect is of creating a permanent check against the 
real, or perceived, acts of corruption by the nations political elite. 
Such a mechanism is badly needed if our politicians are serious in 
arresting the fatal depletion of public faith in the integrity of elected 
representatives and the viability of the democratic process itself.
    
Who is afraid of accountability except the guilty. As Asfandyar bristled: 
Why is the government running away from it? Lets start with Nawaz, then 
Benazir, and the process must start from the front benchers and then move 
towards the back benchers. For once the forgotten back benchers on either 
side must have been secretly grateful for their lesser political fortunes.
    
As for the house committee on law, Asfandyar had another concern. Pointing 
out to the presence of federal minister Haji Nawaz Khokhar on the 
committee, he snapped: He is a loan defaulter himself. Do you think the 
treasury controlled committee would allow passage of laws that would 
incriminate Khokhar himself?
    
Dr Zulfiqar Mirza and Hakim Ali Zardari offered inconclusive, and equally 
unconvincing, denials of any influence peddling in their financial dealings 
but as Khwaja Asif claimed, this was not the issue. Slightly modifying the 
oppositions earlier allegations, he said the manner in which the loans 
worth over Rs3 billion had been doled out by state-run banks suggested at 
least the patronage of the ruling family even if it were accepted for 
arguments sake that they did not own those industries directly.
    
It is questionable whether the prime ministers family, as charged by the 
leader of the opposition, was a direct beneficiary but it is a fact that 
loans were dispersed rather promptly to known friends of the ruling family 
and that three billion rupees are out there somewhere, and thats the 
bottom line. The prime minister must ensure that the current status of 
these loans is divulged to the nation because any secrecy on this front 
only stands to tarnish her own image.
    
The government could begin by revealing details of the eight cases cited by 
the opposition leader and in the next phase could take up the list of 
influential defaulters named by Khwaja Asif. It is about time the 
government started fighting because in all fairness there is hardly any 
dearth of skeletons in the oppositions cupboard but the cagey government 
reaction to the commission proposal is making it look like the only sinner 
on the block, which it surely is not. But who will convince it to call the 
oppositions bluff?
    
By the time the issue of the rather steep fall of the rupee, about Rs1.10 
against the dollar, was raised by Sheikh Rashid, the Karachi stock market 
had already witnessed a drop of almost 13 points while the dollar was 
fetching a little over Rs41 in curb trading. Sheikh Rashid asked: Why 
doesnt the government tell us what it plans doing with the economy? As if 
the government knew.

THE good news is that the Prime minister has announced her intention to 
eliminate what has come to be known as the VIP culture.
    
Now for the bad news: this newspapers correspondent in Dera Ghazi Khan 
informed us last week that Hundreds of people remained stranded for 
several hours on the DG Khan-Quetta road as local [sic] administration kept 
blocked the traffic due to President Legharis visit to Fort Manro [sic] on 
Friday evening. Fruit and vegetables were spoiled due to over 12-hour 
blockade of traffic on the road as this route is commonly used for supply 
of daily-use articles from Balochistan to the Punjab. Apparently, the 
President was expected to reach Fort Munro in the evening, but over-zealous 
local bureaucrats closed the road at midday, causing a huge traffic jam on 
the narrow road. The reporter concluded his story cryptically by informing 
us that this fiasco made the situation complex. Ill bet. Can you imagine 
the epithets that must have been hurled at the local administration, the 
government and the President by the irate mob of drivers and passengers? 
Must have turned the air blue. We should all be grateful that the President 
was spared an earful of the choice language that was probably used.
    
But to be fair to him, I am certain that Mr Leghari had no idea of the 
inconvenience  to say nothing of the financial loss  his visit caused to 
thousands of people. As usual in such cases, petty functionaries eager to 
score points and cover their own flanks over-step all bounds of reasonable 
security precautions. Concerned only about the impression they will make on 
their superiors, they cant be bothered about minor details like public 
convenience.
    
This incident is a good example of the VIP culture the Prime minister has 
vowed to eradicate. Well, she can start by ordering an inquiry into why 
thousands of people had to wait for hours in the heat just to ensure that 
the Presidents cavalcade could glide into Fort Munro without being 
inconvenienced by the odd truck or wagon. As a politician, Benazir Bhutto 
cannot be unaware of the negative fallout of such hamhanded bureaucratic 
actions. And yet the DG Khan incident is only the tip of the iceberg: 
nowhere are power and privilege abused as much as they are in Pakistan.
    
When the PM talks of ending the VIP culture, she makes it sound like a 
long drawn-out crusade. Actually, unlike problems like poverty or 
corruption, much of the VIP syndrome can be eliminated by simple 
administrative steps. For instance, take the whole wretched VIP lounge 
concept. Originally open only to a handful, it now caters to the frail egos 
of literally thousands of people. Every grade 21 officer and above, plus 
hundreds of more junior bureaucrats (and their uniformed counterparts in 
the defence services), have access to these exclusive areas, as do all 
(repeat, all) past and present members of assemblies and their families.
    
As a result of this devaluation of VIP status, the lounge at Islamabad is 
now frequently more crowded than the passenger lounge for ordinary mortals. 
All the Prime Minister has to do is issue instructions closing down all VIP 
lounges at airports across the country. What will happen is that these so-
called VIPs will have to walk through normal passenger areas which may 
result in irreparable damage to their swollen self-esteem, but will not 
cause the collapse of civilisation as we know it. After all, bureaucrats, 
ministers and MPs in other countries rub shoulders with ordinary passengers 
without picking up any contagious diseases.
    
Another simple administrative measure that will go a long way in softening 
the impact of so-called VVIP movements is to severely limit the number of 
official meeters and greeters and sundry sycophants who invariably turn 
at the airport to receive the Prime Minister and President when they arrive 
anywhere. I once counted 56 cars in the PMs motorcade when she was being 
escorted from the airport to Bilawal House. OK, so a few cars with cops are 
needed as are a couple of limousines carrying the Chief Minister and the 
Governor. But does every officer in the Sindh Secretariat and his brother 
have to turn up? And each government MP plus every aspirant to high office? 
Do so many cars have to clog the main road, keeping ordinary citizens 
waiting every time the PM comes to town? Fifty-six cars? Please give us a 
break.
    
When Benazir Bhutto came to power in 1993, she issued instructions that 
none of her ministers would use more than one official car. This rule was 
widely welcomed by the public, but was soon observed only in the breach by 
those it was aimed at. Now, each federal and provincial minister has a 
fleet of literally dozens of cars and jeeps. These worthies have 
circumvented the PMs instructions by the simple expedient of ordering 
departments and autonomous organisations under their control to hand over a 
certain number of vehicles, or else. So when the government recently 
announced a ban on the purchase of official cars, ministers were not put to 
any inconvenience. But then they seldom are. The PM only needs to issue 
fresh instructions, transferring these hijacked vehicles back to their 
rightful owners.
    
One manifestation of the VIP syndrome that not only annoys paying 
passengers in PIA, but also causes a loss to the airline is the business of 
special quotas for various departments on all domestic flights. Thus, seats 
are blocked for the PMs Secretariat, the Presidency, GHQ, the Ombudsmans 
office, CAA, the Coast Guards, sundry Corps Commanders and service chiefs, 
and several other officials and organisations. This list, too, grows longer 
every year. When these quotas are not utilised, the seats are released a 
few hours before take-off, with the result that they often remain vacant. 
No commercial airline anywhere in the world has any comparable arrangement. 
But this is another expensive approach the PM can end with a stroke of the 
pen.
    
In short, if the Prime Minister is really serious about ending the VIP 
culture that has taken root here, she does not need a two-thirds majority 
in Parliament, nor does she have to wage a long struggle against 
insurmountable odds. All she needs is the will to actually do away with 
these archaic privileges that bureaucrats and politicians have grabbed for 
themselves.
    
For starters, she should find out for herself what happened recently in 
D.G. Khan, as should the President.

VIP culture is the latest fad, the catchall phrase that is buzzing around 
and is being roundly condemned, including by those who are its 
beneficiaries. It is being portrayed as a self-evident evil and there are 
strident calls for its abolition.
    
It has become like Mark Twains weather: everybody complains but nothing is 
done about it. Calls for its abolition misses the point. VIP culture is a 
state of mind and is not some kind of a surcharge that has been levied 
though it can be indirectly considered that as it has financial 
implications. Mrs Sarojini Naidu said of Mahatama Gandhi who had made a 
fetish of austerity and travelled in a third class railway carriage that 
Gandhiji did not realise how much it costs to keep him in poverty. Our VIPs 
too do not realise how costly it can be to give them the perks that they 
demand by way of a right while shedding crocodile tears about the cost of 
living and the burden that the awam must carry.
    
What is being targeted are manifestations of a so-called VIP culture, the 
pomp and ostentation, the privileges like the somewhat absurd car number-
plate that says Senator or MNA by virtue of which traffic rules are relaxed 
and there is no compulsion to stop their vehicles at a red light. Or the 
bullying of PIA ground staff to demand a seat even when none is available 
and all but forcibly getting it, thus setting a high example and 
underscoring, in the bargain, the virtues of democracy. The main thrust is 
against public representatives and it is their conduct or misconduct that 
comes in for sharp criticism.
    
But the fact of the matter is that VIP culture goes much beyond these 
public representatives and it operates in all spheres of life. It has to go 
with power and the exercise of it. While absolute power corrupts absolutely 
even a little power corrupts in its own little way. The billing clerk at 
one of the public utilities has power over the consumers when a bill has to 
be re-adjusted. When you present your ticket at an airline counter, it is 
the man or woman behind the counter who has control over you and can decide 
arbitrarily whether you will travel or not. The lift man in a government 
secretariat building may choose not to take you up or make you wait while 
he smokes a cigarette. For that very brief moment all these people are VIPs 
and they enjoy that moment. But this does not come in the category of VIP 
culture as it is perceived.
    
What is perceived is the political equivalent of conspicuous consumption, 
the privileges are flaunted and there is an element of arrogance in the 
flaunting, amounting almost to a mocking. I dont think the people would 
particularly mind if we were an enormously rich country but we are not. Or 
so we are told tirelessly. In fact the picture of the economy that is 
painted has no shades of light and dark. It is one of unrelieved darkness 
and we are not wanting in soothsayers of gloom whose crystal ball shows the 
imminent collapse of the economy. Any household faced with the prospect of 
approaching poverty will make drastic re-adjustments, will, first of all, 
eliminate what are perceived to be luxuries and will try and safeguard the 
basics. VIP culture is a luxury and that is the kindest thing I can say 
about it.
    
But it seems a little unfair to target only the public representatives. 
Admittedly these public representatives have a high profile and since they 
are given to sermonising and moralising, their actions, their lifestyles 
are contrasted with what they advocate with such strident voices. In a 
manner of speaking these public representatives are accountable.
    
But what about the bureaucrats? Admittedly they do not travel around in 
motorcades and traffic is not held up. But in their quiet way, they are the 
real beneficiaries of the VIP culture. In respect of the public 
representatives, we are in the area of vanity. All the fuss that is made of 
them is intended to pamper to their ego. To the bureaucrat, the VIP culture 
is the exercise of power. They are the movers and shakers and they are not 
accountable. It is possible that they do not set out to be arrogant but the 
system makes them so.
    
I have written about this before but nothing typifies this arrogance more 
than the simple (or not so simple) refusal of the bureaucrat to return a 
telephone call. Given that there is no way that you will be connected when 
you make the telephone call, you will be told that the person is in a 
meeting. This is an automatic reaction and I rather suspect that it is a 
recording. A new variant of this, depending on the seniority of the person, 
is that he has gone to the Prime Ministers Secretariat. Perish the thought 
that the call will be returned.
    
I have a suspicion that this unwillingness to return a call is written in 
the service code of the bureaucrats. This too is a manifestation of the VIP 
culture and when if the VIP culture is abolished, this aspect of it will be 
exempted. When VIP culture is abolished, it will wound the vanity of the 
public representatives. But there is nothing we can do that can menace the 
power of the bureaucrats.
    
One final thought: I am surprised that public representatives who rely on 
the goodwill of the public in order to stay in office have not realised 
that while they may be influencing people, they are certainly not winning 
friends by this political conspicuous consumption.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="team">Team for Canada & Kenya ties named</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, Sept 5: A 17-member Pakistan cricket team, comprising  14 players 
and three officials, was announced by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on 
Thursday for the 5-match Sahara Cup one-day international series against 
India in Toronto (Canada) and the quadrangular tournament in Kenya.
     
The biggest surprise is the omission of the dependable wicketkeeper/batsman 
Rashid Latif, who not only played notable part in Pakistan teams victory 
in the first Test against England but also batted magnificently in the last 
one-day international in highly trying circumstances during the just-
concluded tour to help carve out a creditable win for Pakistan.
     
Also axed from the Pakistan cricket team, who made a successful tour of 
England this summer are pacemen Ata-ur-Rehman and Muhammad Akram, 
experienced all-rounder Asif Mujtaba and opener Shahid Anwar.
 
Included in the fourteen-member side are opener Saleem Elahi and promising 
all-rounder Azhar Mahmood. Younger brother of Test all-rounder Manzoor 
Elahi and international player Zahoor Elahi, the young opener is a good 
fielder. He had scored an enterprising century against the visiting Sri 
Lanka team but could not do well during Pakistan cricket teams tour of 
Australia. He has been a consistent scorer during the domestic competitions 
during the last many seasons. Azhar Mahmood is a dashing batsman, good 
fielder and a useful medium-pace bowler, who shows promise.
     
Led by world-class all-rounder Wasim Akram, the Pakistan team consists of 
four openers Aamir Sohail (vice-captain), Saeed Anwar Shadab Kabir and 
Saleem Elahi. It includes three pacemen viz Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram and 
Shahid Nazir. Only wicketkeeper taken in the side is Moin Khan, who scored 
a century  against England during the recent tour of England. Middle-order 
batting has been strengthened with the inclusion of Ejaz Ahmad, Inzamam-ul-
Haq and Salim Malik. The spin department will be looked after by the 
experienced leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmad, who proved a match-winner in 
England. Promising off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq has also been retained in 
the team. The two genuine all-rounders in the team are Wasim Akram and 
Azhar Mahmood. However, Salim Malik and Aamir Sohail can also be included 
in that category due to their utility as bowlers, though the two are of 
different types.
    
The fourteen players and the three officials are:
     
Captain Wasim Akram, vice-captain Aamir Sohail, Saeed Anwar, Ejaz Ahmad, 
Inzamam-ul-Haq, Salim Malik, Saleem Elahi, Azhar Mahmood, Waqar Younis, 
Mushtaq Ahmad, Saqlain Mushtaq, Shahid Nazir, Moin Khan, Shadab Kabir. 
Officials: Tour Manager Mian Muhammad Munir (President, Lahore Division 
Cricket Association), Cricket Manager Mushtaq Muhammad and physiotherapist 
Dr Dan Kiesel.
     
Majid Khan said that the Pakistan cricket team will leave for Canada on 
Sept 11. After playing five one-day international matches of Sahara Cup in 
Toronto (Canada) the team will return to Karachi on Sept 25. The team, 
after a three-hour stop-over in Karachi on that night will fly over to 
Kenya for the four-nation tournament. Besides Pakistan and the host nation 
Kenya, the sixth World Cup champion Sri Lanka and South Africa would also 
be taking part in the competition of one-day internationals there.

<a name="paki">Pakistan team off to Canada for Sahara Cup</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 10: The Pakistan cricket team minus its skipper Wasim Akram 
left here for Toronto, Canada, in the small hours of Wednesday to 
participate in the five-match series for the Sahara Cup against India.
    
Wasim Akram left early Tuesday morning for London where he had a meeting 
with his financial adviser, family sources confirmed. The sources, however, 
stated that Wasim would be joining the team at the Toronto airport on 
Thursday. He had to discuss some business work with his financial adviser 
but he will be arriving Toronto on time, skippers spouse, Huma, said.
    
The Pakistan cricketers assembled in the city on Tuesday evening before 
taking a flight to Frankfurt on way to Toronto.
    
Wasims deputy Aamir Sohail, Waqar Younis, Mushtaq Ahmad, Saeed Anwar, 
Saqlain Mushtaq, Azhar Mahmood, Inzamamul Haq, Salim Elahi and Shahid Nazir 
arrived in the evening from Lahore while Salim Malik and Ijaz Ahmad joined 
their mates from Islamabad. Local boys Moin Khan and Shadab Kabir had 
checked-in in hotel late afternoon.
    
Pakistan open the five-match series against the traditional rivals on 
Saturday and then play the next match on the following day. After a two-day 
rest, Pakistan-India will clash again on Wednesday while the final two 
games will be played on Saturday and Sunday.
    
Pakistan at present enjoy the cutting edge over India because of recent 
success on the second half of the England summer. India, on the contrary, 
toured England in the first half and failed to won a single match on the 
tour. However, the advantage may be nullified because the conditions in 
Toronto are unknown.
    
Whatever may be the outcome of the series, the followers of the game are 
likely to see some of the most thrilling games in the next 10 days.
    
*From Canada, the Pakistan cricket team will return to Karachi after a six-
hour transit, will leave for Kenya where it will participate in the 
quadrangular tournament also to be competed by world champions Sri Lanka, 
South Africa and hosts Kenya. The only change to take place during six 
hours transit at Karachi will be the replacement of the Tour Manager. Mian 
Munir will be replaced by Nusrat Azeem.

<a name="thes">The setback in the one-day cricket series</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

Pakistans 1-2 setback against England in the one-day internationals must 
have come as a shock to the Pakistani fans and supporters who were present 
in large numbers at the playing venues as it came to and those watching the 
matches live on TV.
    
Why this abysmal outcome for a team which had shown its all-round strength 
and high calibre to pin down England in the strenuous Test encounters and 
why suddenly the reversal in situation that enabled the losing side to turn 
the tables later on? How is it that a metamorphosis occurred for a squad 
which was brimming with confidence when it set its foot on the English 
soil?.
    
It is possible the visitors may have become over-confident against a foe 
which was apparently weak and frail against a more balanced combination; it 
is also possible that Pakistan may have taken England lightly after their 
success, recorded in a felicitous fashion, in the Test series. England, 
mauled earlier in five-day duels, took the one-dayers as a challenge and 
every player determinedly and sensibly contributed his bit to get the 
verdict in the teams favour.
    
The view that a switch from the ordeal of the Test matches to instant 
cricket made a world of difference and Pakistan was unable to attune to the 
new circumstance is unacceptable since the Test triumph had given a 
psychological advantage to the visitors. Their tails were up and had they 
played as devotedly and stoutly as in the Test series the result may have 
been different as they clinched a well-merited victory in the last one-day. 
The line of least resistance in the first two limited-overs was 
inexplicable and cannot but be deplored. If at all the Pakistan outfit 
locks horns with India in the Canadian city of Toronto with the same lax 
approach the team will be in for trouble despite the latters poor record 
in England and their far from impressive attack.
    
Many put forward the view that Pakistan had not been able to assert their 
supremacy on previous tours of England in the one-dayers, having won the 
Test duels in style. In 1987 Pakistan had bowed to England by 4-1, in 1992 
they had lost by a margin of 2-1. However, Pakistan had the resources to 
lower the colours of England even in the limited-overs tussle and the team 
should have found the inspiration from the earlier success and shown the 
foresight to tackle the problematical moments in the first and second one-
dayers. After all England had been beaten by a comprehensive margin of 
seven wickets in the World Cup last March.
    
Cricket Manager Mushtaq Ahmeds opinion that the players had wearied out 
after the Test series is a misconstrued logic as during the present-day 
cricket the games are played round the year and the players are all 
professionals. They are supposed to stand up to the stress and strain of 
combative cricket for five days or in the changed situation of one-dayers. 
Besides, the tour had a shortened itinerary - three Test matches and three 
limited- overs ties. The cricketers, one can easily presume, had the 
physical strength to meet the English challenge if they had exhibited the 
shrewd skill and adroitness and the managers had made the necessary pre-
match planning.
    
Among England batsmen Nick Knight was the pick of the lot, scoring two 
centuries in succession at Birmingham and Notthingham. He had his one-day 
debut in the series and yet he demonstrated easeful strokeplay against top-
class and varied bowling.
    
Englands batsmen plundered 292 in the second one-day at Birmingham, a 
target almost impossible to be attained by the visitors. It beats ones mid 
how they could thrash a bowling reckoned as the most venomous, penetrating 
and having biting spin. During the 1992 trip the England batsmen set a one-
day record of the highest innings by amassing 363 for 7 ( in a 55-over 
match) with vigorous hitting of an attack consisting of Wasim Akram, Waqar 
Younis, Mushtaq Ahmed, Aamir Sohail and Aqib Javed. This time again they 
lustily hit the bowling.
    
Many other English batsmen viz Stawart, Maynard and Atherton prospered in 
what were the agonising first two one-dayers for Pakistan. Adam Hollioake 
was a discovery as a medium-pacer as he took eight wickets with his canny 
length and line. However, the most impressive of the English bowlers proved 
to be Robert Croft, always troubling the batsmen, keeping the runs down 
with his intelligent off-spin.
    
It was poetic justice for a team which was termed favourites at the start 
of the one-day series that it snatched the spoils of the last match in what 
turned out to be a thrilling and breath-taking encounter. In the first ball 
of the last over Saqlain Mushtaq, trying a hefty swipe, was caught off 
Hollioake. And then seven runs were to be scored in five balls. Rashid with 
the boldness that he has cut the bowler towards point for a four. The next 
delivery was hit over the bowlers head and the game was Pakistans for an 
exciting and deserving win. Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad had earlier played 
enterprising, though watchful, innings to lay a fine foundation for 
Pakistans victory. However, it was the courageous knock of Rashid that 
earned success for Pakistan when all hopes had been lost and the visitors 
were struggling for runs. It is sad that his claims for the Sahara Cup and 
latterly for the Kenyan trip have been ignored.
    
Saeed Anwar again proved to be a consistent run-getter. Ijaz too batted 
gallantly, sure and brisk. Though Aamir Sohails contributions in the first 
and third matches were not insignificant he did not appear his usual self 
batting with swift energy as an opener.
    
Waqar again had the pace and the venom in his bowling though one thought 
Wasim Akram was losing much of the fire and control for which he had been 
known.
    
Both the newly-inducted players in the last encounter viz. Shahid Anwar and 
Shahid Nazir, proved their success in their own fields for which credit has 
to be given to the previous selectors who performed their duties well and 
had picked up a balanced side, including the raw hands.

<a name="impr">Pakistans impressive show in England</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

LONDON: Pakistan on their nine weeks tour of England raised themselves 
above their normal standards to achieve what they did by winning the three 
match Test series with an emphatic margin of 2-0 and ending the tour in a 
befitting manner with a sensational win by two wickets in the third and 
final one-day match at Trent-Bridge.
    
Taking into consideration their overall performance against the Counties 
where they won five of their eight matches and their victories against the 
National Cricket Association (NCA XI), the Minor counties, the MCC and 
Scotland in one-day matches, their only defeat against a county 
Warwickshire and their two off-colour outings in the first two one-day 
internationals, one could not help praising their single-mindedness and 
consistency with which they were able to maintain superiority. At times 
even in the face of provocation and mind-boggling umpiring decisions, they 
displayed tremendous restraint. Not that they were not tested. They were, 
by a certain section of the media and a couple of malicious and impish 
comments on television at the beginning of the tour. But if tolerance is 
virtue then I can assure you that this Pakistan team led by Wasim Akram 
passed the test by miles which others before him failed.
    
For this the credit goes not only to all the members of the team but to the 
management on tour consisting of Yawar Saeed and Nasim-ul-Ghani, two 
experienced hands in this game who as incharge of man-management and team 
management left nothing to be desired. They made sure that every member of 
the team is well looked after and well advised whenever advice was needed.
    
Not many teams on a tour of England have left so much good will and so many 
friends as did this Pakistan team which fact has even been recognised by 
the local media and the officials of the game in England.
    
Immaculately dressed in their green Pakistan blazers, they travelled in 
their team coach and entered the grounds as an international team should do 
thus raising their profile as the members of a country which is 
unquestionably, the best. That they suffered very few injuries on this tour 
was mainly due to the effort of Dan Kiesal, their Eveready physic whose 
expertise kept them well tuned.
    
Pakistans 164 runs win in the first Test at Lords, their well contested 
drawn Test at Headingley and their breathtaking victory at The Oval in the 
final Test which gave them their fifth successive win in a series against 
England would not have been possible if their batting line-up had faltered 
or their bowling had failed.

Pakistan should be proud of this team.

<a name="hase">Pakistan has edge over India: Akram</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Sept 8: Pakistan captain Wasim Akram on Sunday opined that 
Pakistan enjoyed a psychological advantage over India for the Sahara Cup 
but advised his players and followers of the game not to be complacent.
    
I agree that at the moment, we enjoy a cutting edge over India but we 
should not forget that India is a strong team and has beaten us in the 
past, the skipper said from his Lahore residence.
    
Pakistan put up a much impressive show in the second half of summer in 
England winning the Test series 2-0 though lost the one-day series 1-2. 
India, in the first half of English summer, failed to win a single match 
losing the Test series 1-0 and the one-day series 2-0. Indian problems 
compounded in Sri Lanka where they failed to qualify for the finals of the 
quadrangular event won by the world champions, Sri Lanka.
    
The Indian team possesses some very talented players and if they click, 
they can make things difficult for the opposition, Akram said.

Akram expressed his displeasure over the itinerary of the Sahara Cup. I 
dont think it is ideal. It is very difficult for the cricketers to play 
back-to-back one-day matches. I feel that while preparing the itinerary, 
the organisers considered the comfort of the spectators rather than the two 
teams.
    
The Sahara Cup matches will be played on Sept 14, 15, 18, 21 and 22.
    
Discussing the quadrangular tournament in Kenya where Pakistans main 
rivals will be South Africa and Sri Lanka besides Kenya, Wasim Akram said 
the stakes will be high because nowadays, the enthusiasts want to see top 
grade one-day cricket.
    
Pakistan, this season, will be playing at least 26 one-day internationals 
in Canada, Kenya, Sharjah, Australia and at home.

<a name="lamb">Lamb joins Botham in libel appeal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Athar Ali

LONDON, Sept 11: The former England Test cricketer Allan Lamb has now 
declared that he also intends to file an appeal against the High Court 
verdict in the libel case he had jointly brought with Ian Botham against 
Imran Khan. The jury by a majority of 10-2 had on July 31 dismissed the 
case against the former Pakistan Test captain. The plaintiffs were asked to 
pay the legal costs which are estimated to be 500,000 pounds.
    
The jury verdict came after 13 days of hearing during which several cricket 
personalities, past and present, including the England captain Mike 
Atherton, appeared to give testimony. Ian Botham and Allan Lamb had alleged 
that Imran in a news magazine interview had accused them both of being 
racists and attacked their upbringing and class. Ian Botham also accused 
Imran Khan of saying that he had cheated at the game and that all top 
England bowlers of the past twenty years had on occasion indulged in ball-
tampering.
    
Imran Khan had denied both the allegations. he said he was misquoted the 
racist remarks and had offered to publicly state this but the plaintiffs 
refused his offer. He also denied having called Botham a cheat in a 
newspaper interview. The interviews were given when the ball-tampering 
accusations against Pakistani bowlers on the 1992 England tour were fresh 
and were being repeated by the British media.
    
Imran Khans solicitor on Monday, following reports of Ian Bothams 
intention to file an appeal, had said that the action if brought will be 
vigorously fought. Now Lamb has decided to join with his former team mate 
to go for appeal.
    
Lamb today instructed his lawyers to file an appeal against the High Court 
verdict. Ian Botham, who was the first to make the decision, is taking the 
plea that the jury in the trial was misdirected.
    
If the appeals by Botham and Lamb are admitted the hearing will not take 
place before next summer. The appeal can only be made on technical grounds 
and no fresh evidence can be admitted.

<a name="hong">Hong Kong Open Complacent Jansher gets a jolt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

Before launching his assault for the eighth victory in the Hong Kong Open 
squash championship defending champion Jansher Khan, stated at the 
Islamabad Press conference, that he was mentally and physically fit for the 
coming event but his defeat in the final against Australia world number two 
Rodney Eyles and that too in straight games showed that he was not in top 
fitness and form.
    
The great Khan, the number one player of the world circuit, is a great 
retriever and even after losing the first two games he had demonstrated his 
fighting capabilities to overcome the challenges. This had happened on 
several occasions. The score-line (10-15, 10-15, 5-15) suggests lack of 
preparation and stamina.
    
The surprising failure of top seeded Jansher the pre-tournament favourite 
at the hands of stroke-maker Rodney Elyes whom the Khan had several times 
humbled hands down. About four months back the mighty Khan crushed Rodney 
Eyles 1513, 158, 1510 in the British Open final for his fifth victory  
is nonetheless a warning for the Champion.
    
Press reports about the Hong Kong final led the keen observers of the game 
to believe that Jansher Khan did not go through the required hard training 
before the tournament as he used to do, before embarking on a super series 
event.
    
After winning the AlAhram International in Cairo on May 22, Jansher Khan 
had almost three months lay-off as there had been no other super series 
event in between the Hong Kong Open, which he had won seven times. He might 
have got complacent and did not go through the required regimen.
    
Rodney Elyes domination of the front of the court further post-match 
indicated that Jansher Khan could not dislodge him from the Tee obviously 
because the Khans length fell short. The Australian proved dangerous on 
the front court as he produced a variety of strokes to make his rival 
commit unforced errors.
    
The Khan, in his statement, also accepted that his winning backhand volleys 
let him down and he would work harder for the next tournament.

WASHINGTON: A young Pakistani-American, son of a Peshawar University 
Engineering graduate who emigrated to the US in early 70s and carved out a 
successful engineering business for himself, is creating history on the 
American tennis scene. He is poised to become the first Pakistani to hit 
the top 10 ranking players in America and he is still not yet 16.
    
Rameez Qamar, a high school freshman (a student of the 9th class) of the 
Robinson School in Virginia, is already hitting the headlines in the US 
media. He has won the singles title of the State of Virginia, Washington 
D.C. and Maryland and is ranked No.1 in the US Tennis Associations Mid-
Atlantic Region. He is ranked number 4 in the overall under-16s.
    
Rameez, a shy lanky youngster, has only one passion, to play tennis, win or 
lose, and he is doing it with full support and back-up of his family his 
engineer father Syed Javed Qamar and an understanding mother who knows the 
kid and his dad have to travel all over the country, leaving her and a 
younger son behind.
    
The tennis big sponsors are already homing in on the boy. Prestigious firms 
provide him with all his outfits take care of his rackets and playing gear 
and at a tender age, Rameez is beginning to feel what stardom looks like.
    
He has won title after title in Virginia and the US schools circuit and has 
created a record of becoming the first 9th grader to ever become the state 
champion. Once 16, he will enter the main US circuit and already he is 
preparing himself for the big show.
    
I am going to try and make it by playing tennis and playing it well, he 
told me in his Fairfax county home. Sitting in the middle of what looked 
like a wholesale store of trophies, medals and certificates, stacked in 
every open space in his living room, Rameez is mindful that his brilliance 
is earning him a special status in the US, being the first immigrant to 
reach the top.
    
While he keeps his focus on the ball and his next match, Rameezs father 
Javed, himself a recognised table tennis player of the middle 60s in 
Pakistan, who represented the NWFP in national championships, has his eyes 
on what the new status of Rameez can do to help tennis in Pakistan.
    
Javed, who officiates as the manager for Rameez, says tennis in Pakistan 
could get a big boost if talented players like his son could contribute to 
their countrys efforts in coming up to the world standards.

<a name="goah">Go-ahead given to city sports project</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Saghir Ahmed

KARACHI, Sept 11: KMC was given a go-ahead signal on Wednesday by the Chief 
Minister, Syed Abdullah Shah, for reviving the development project for 
sports activities on the Kashmir Road Complex, spread over 30 acres.
    
The project envisages mainly laying of an astroturf for hockey, tartan 
track, a football ground and velodrome, besides construction of five 
swimming pools in each district.
    
The KMC Director of Sports Saifur Rehman Grami informed the Chief Minister 
that the plan had earlier been approved and tenders had been floated after 
designing the details of the project for which a sum of about Rs 55 million 
was earmarked in 1995-96 but it lapsed for various reasons and the project 
was put into cold storage as no funds have been earmarked in the current 
financial year, he added.
    
The Chief Minister expressed his displeasure over the situation and 
directed KMC Administrator Sibghat Mansoor to inquire under what 
circumstances the funds got lapsed.
