Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 11: Defence Minister Shahid Hamid said the caretakers had 
surmounted most of the difficulties and elections would definitely be held 
on schedule.
    
Making a statement in the Senate, the caretaker defence minister dispelled 
the impression created by remarks of a US official that Pakistan might not 
be able to hold election on Feb. 3.
    
He denied reports that the caretaker Foreign Minister, Sahibzada Yaqub 
Khan, during his meeting with US Secretary of State Warren Christopher had 
talked of some difficulties faced by the caretaker government, which might 
lead to the postponement of elections.
    
He said the government recently promulgated Representation of People (4th 
Amendment) Ordinance and all members on the election commission had been 
appointed. Thus, most of the difficulties in the way of holding elections 
on time had been removed, he added. Elections shall be held on Feb. 3, he 
said in categoric terms. There should be no misgiving or doubt that the 
caretaker government would put off the elections.

<a name="cjhi">CJ hints at deciding fate of 8th Amendment</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 10: The Supreme Court said it might give an authoritative 
judgment on the issue of the 8th Amendment deciding whether or not the 
amendment should remain part of the Constitution.
    
A former member of the National Assembly, Mahmood Khan Achakzai has also 
filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the 8th Amendment.
    
His attorney Qazi Jamil the Supreme Court bench that he could wait for the 
hearing of his petition and instead the petitions of Ms Bhutto and the 
Speaker should be heard first.
    
During the hearing, the chief justice asked Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, who is 
assisting the court as amicus curiae, whether the Indian Supreme Court had 
struck down any constitutional provisions.
    
Pirzada said that the Supreme Court had recently struck down a 
constitutional provision for all practical purposes when it declared that 
Article 209 would prevail over Article 203-C as the former article was 
incorporated by the chief martial law administrator through 8th Amendment 
and that the latter article was enacted by the framers of the constitution. 
These articles related to the powers of the president in the appointment of 
judges in the Federal Shariat Court.
    
Mr Pirzada submitted that the 8th Amendment had changed the basic structure 
of the constitution from the parliamentary to presidential form of 
government. He referred to Article 90 where, before the 8th Amendment, the 
executive authority of the federation vested in the prime minister. 
However, after the amendment, this power was vested in the president.
    
He regretted that at least one government of Nawaz Sharif enjoyed two-third 
majority in the parliament but did not repeal the 8th Amendment.
    
He said articles 238 and 239 which relate to bringing amendments in the 
Constitution have been altered in such a manner that now it has become 
difficult to amend the Constitution. Mr Pirzada said the original provision 
provided passage of an amendment by two-third majority in the National 
Assembly and absolute majority in the Senate. But now two-thirds majority 
was required to change the Constitution. Pakistan may be among the 10 top 
countries where it is difficult to amend the Constitution, Mr Pirzada 
added.
    
The chief justice expressed his intention to hear the petition filed by Mr 
Mahmood Achakzai as this was the main cause of the dissolution of 
successive assemblies in the country. He told Qazi Jamil that the court 
could go into this issue and give its decision.
    
Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah said that all these cases involved very high 
law points. He said the court would take up the case of Benazir Bhutto next 
week, though the grounds of the dissolution would also be contested by 
Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) which has requested the court for making it a 
party to the case.
    
Hafeez Pirzada explained difference between inherent and permissive 
fundamental rights. He said the speaker had no fundamental right to 
approach the court when his tenure or his assemblys tenure is cut short by 
the prime minister himself. If he has no right when the prime minister 
dissolves the assembly he cannot have a right to directly approach the 
Supreme Court when the president exercises his constitutional powers, he 
said.
    
Mr Pirzada said if at all there was anybody who had a right to approach the 
court directly was the prime minister because in a parliamentary form of 
government the prime minister represents the entire nation.
    
Hafeez Pirzada said it was provided in the principles of policy that the 
president and the governor would lay a report on the implementation of the 
principles of policy before the assembly but regretted that this was not 
done.
    
When the chief justice asked whether the court could be approached for non-
implementation of principles of policy, Mr Pirzada said the court can even 
issue mandamus (a command of the court to an official to fulfil his legal 
obligation).
    
Mr Pirzada also referred to Indian Supreme Court decision in a case where 
four state governments had moved the Supreme Court against the declaration 
of the home minister dissolving the state assemblies on the grounds of 
fundamental right violations and invoking the original jurisdiction of the 
court.
    
He said the issues in those petitions were similar to the one raised in the 
speakers petition.

<a name="bena">Benazir alleges conspiracy to harm PPP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 5: Deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto alleged that the 
presidents men were negotiating with the imprisoned criminals belonging 
to the Shaheed Bhutto and Altaf groups for their release, on the condition 
that they would attack PPP leaders and disrupt its meetings.
    
Ms Bhutto said when such elements, most of whom were Indian-trained, would 
be released on such conditions, peace would be endangered as well as the 
life and property of the common man. They would not only attack PPP 
leaders but there would be an increase in bomb blasts and bank robberies.
    
The deposed prime minister said: I am shocked to see that the Presidents 
men were negotiating a deal with the Indian- trained criminal elements in 
their anti-Benazir obsession.
    
Replying to a question, Ms Bhutto said not all the elements of MQM were 
involved in criminal activity and that her government had always emphasised 
this point in dealing with the MQM. In this context she said that her 
government had released some MQM activists in August on assurances from 
their parents that in future they would not indulge in criminal activities.
    
The PPP chairperson unleashed a tirade against the president and demanded 
his trial because he had failed to prove any of the charges mentioned in 
the proclamation of dismissal, despite a lapse of one month. she said 
adding that if Ehtesab is intended it should begin with the president 
because serious charges have been levelled against him.
    
She alleged President Farooq Leghari was spearheading the group which had 
conspired to eliminate the PPP and the Bhuttos from the politics of 
Pakistan and set up a kings party.
    
Ms Bhutto alleged that she was being threatened that if she did not succumb 
to pressures, Asif Zardari could face the gallows. She said that her 
brother Murtaza was killed by the anti- Bhutto forces to get her government 
out and implicate her husband to pressure her for accepting the fait 
accompli.
    
Ms Bhutto said she could not expect justice in the Murtaza case as long as 
President Leghari was at the helm of affairs. 
    
Ms Bhutto challenged the president and her opponents to prove the 
allegations that she or husband owned the Surrey mansion or owned any 
mansion in France or elsewhere, or had sold out Gwadar or Chakwal. Now I 
am not in the government, why they have not yet proved any of the 
allegations they had unleashed through the press to generate hatred against 
my government and the party.

Ali Zardari and Ahmed Sadiq were in detention under MPO-16 while the other 
22 have been challaned and booked in specific cases, he told Dawn.

<a name="ghin">Ghinwa rules out mending fences with Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 7: Ms Ghinwa Bhutto, chairperson PPP (SB) group ruled 
out any possibility of rapprochement with Benazir Bhutto, and said there 
was a strong likelihood that she herself would contest against the 
ousted prime minister in the next elections.

Ghinwa accused her sister-in-law Benazir Bhutto of creating 
circumstances which led to the murder of her husband. If Benazir Bhutto 
believes that there was a conspiracy against her brother Murtaza then 
she should have provided protection to him, she said.

The PPP (SB) chairperson also rejected the ousted prime ministers claim 
that President Farooq Leghari was behind the murder of Murtaza and said 
that Benazir Bhutto should have investigated it when she was the chief 
executive of the country.

She said at one stage there was a possibility of a rapprochement when 
she had asked Benazir for help but instead of helping me and arresting 
the culprits who masterminded the brutal murder of Murtaza, she started 
to defend the police party which was directly involved in Mir Murtaza 
Bhuttos murder. She hoped justice would be done to her by the tribunal 
investigating into the murder of Murtaza Bhutto as changes have been 
made in the investigation team.

Ghinwa also claimed Benazir Bhutto has refused to recognise the rights 
of Murtazas widow and his children to the familys assets.

When asked from where she intends to contest next elections, Ghinwa said 
that there was strongly possibility that she might contest against 
Benazir Bhutto from Larkana. However, she said that the final decision 
on the allocation of party tickets would be made by her partys Central 
Committee. She declared that PPP (SB) will contest elections from all 
the constituencies and even against Benazir Bhutto.

Our channels are open for election alliance with all political parties 
including MQM but not Benazir, she said and hoped that elections will 
be held on time. She asserted that accountability must be held.

Asked about her political future in Pakistan as she faced problem of 
language, Ghinwa said that she was not worried at all on this count 
because she was surrounded by good and experienced people like Meraj 
Mohammad Khan. No other member of my family will join politics as my 
children are very young. We have provided a platform so that good, clean 
and new faces should enter politics through this forum, Ghinwa added.

She said her purpose was not to go after power. However, Ghinwa said she 
was keen to use this platform basically for those founder members of the 
PPP who have been mind and soul of the party. We have always advocated 
that Begum Nusrat Bhutto should be made chairperson of the party but 
Benazir had dismissed her and now Begum Sahiba is being used against 
us, she maintained.

Responding to a question, Ghinwa said she has immense regards and love 
for her mother-in-law and her children were also missing her very much. 
Begum Sahiba is the main source of consolation for us after Murtazas 
death, she said.

<a name="13co">13 corruption cases in OGDC sent to FIA</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 5: The Ministry of Petroleum has referred 13 cases of 
corruption and irregularities in the Oil and Gas Development Corporation to 
the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), caretaker Petroleum Minister Javed 
Jabber said.
    
In one occurrence, a proposal to undertake a study with an estimated cost 
of 2.394 million was moved and approved on the same day. The proposal was 
initiated by the Hydro Carbon Development Institute and it was passed by 
the ministry on the same day with out observing the normal procedure, he 
said.
 
The contract was eventually awarded to a company named IPR. The minister 
himself did not know what IPR stands for. When asked about the actual name 
of the company, he said the full name of company was not mentioned in any 
document.
    
In another case the former OGDC chairman Rifat Askari ordered the purchase 
of vehicles. Pir Koh Gas Limited on the verbal orders by the chairman 
allocated an amount of Rs 7 million. The vehicles were purchased, but the 
OGDC subsidiary from whose account the amount was withdrawn got no vehicle, 
he said.
    
When asked whether these vehicles had been used in the election campaign of 
Azad Kashmir legislative Assembly, he replied with a broad smile. He said 
the corporation had also borne huge expenses of maintenance and fuel of 
these vehicles.
    
Mr Jabbar said the cases of allotment of LPG quota in violation of the 
rules was also being referred to the accountability commission.
    
Earlier in the Senate he presented a long list of companies and individuals 
issued LPG quotas. Names of Mansoor Leghari a close relative of President 
Farooq Leghari and two ministers in caretaker cabinet were also included in 
the list.
    
President Farooq Leghari he said has given clear directives that the 
accountability should be carried out without any discrimination. The 
president has said that there are no relatives and friends when it comes to 
review of cases, he said.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 7: The Federal Investigation Agency on Saturday sent two 
more references on corruption to interior ministry for forwarding them 
to Chief Ehtesab (accountability) Commission (CEC) for accountability.

Sources in the FIA said that both the references relate to former 
Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA), Shafi Sehwani. These 
references are based on the charges mentioned in two separate FIRs 
earlier lodged against him.

So far the FIA has forwarded references to CEC against four persons. The 
earlier three references filed related to ex-minister Haji Nawaz 
Khokhar, ex-Chairman OGDC Rifaat Askari and former principal secretary 
to deposed prime minister Ahmed Sadiq.

<a name="deal">Benami deal of Legharis land justified</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 8: The Mehran Bank Commission had refused to entertain the 
audio-cassette evidence and affidavit of Hamid Asghar Kidwai, a main 
witness in the Mehran Bank scandal, who lives in self-exile in London, 
because his affidavit had not been attested by the high commission then.
    
The commission exonerated President Farooq Leghari but it did not mention 
to whom the land was sold by the president for Rs15 million and from which 
account the money was debited to make the payment.
    
The land price was transferred from the accounts of unknown buyers in 
Mehran Bank in Karachi to the presidents account in Mehran Bank, Lahore. 
Pakistan Muslim League(N) had then accused that the payments to the 
president were made by Younas Habib through front men.
    
There is no doubt that the president and his co-sharers in the ancestral 
land had sold such land and had received the price thereafter (Rs15 
million) .... Such a sale cannot be considered a dishonest transaction 
unless there are circumstances indicating dishonest or illegal acts, the 
report said. It is the confirmed opinion of the commission, based on the 
evidence before it, that the allegations against the president are 
unfounded.
    
The report has justified the Benami account from where the president 
received the money. In our country Benami transactions are common and had 
been recognised by the courts, and a seller of a property sometimes does 
not know nor is supposed to know who are the real purchasers, so long as 
the price paid is fair and the transaction is fair, the report said.
    
The inquiry report, released on Sunday by the press information department, 
surprisingly does not mention where it had been printed.
    
Three out of five members of the judicial inquiry commission had refused to 
entertain the audio-cassette and affidavit of Mr Kidwai, however, two of 
the members of the commission, its chairman Justice Abdul Qadeer Chaudhry 
and Justice Z.A. Channa, had agreed to place their reliance on the cassette 
and affidavit but the three members did not agree.
    
The cassette, released by the PML-N to establish that many politicians had 
been bribed through the Mehran Bank, allegedly contained secret 
conversation between various beneficiaries.
    
The report has held Younus Habib, ex-chief operating officer of the bank, 
at present imprisoned, for misusing and misappropriating huge public money.
    
We agree with the findings given and recommendations made by our brother 
Z.A. Channa, on all the terms of Reference relating to the Mehran Bank 
Limited, except that since the evidence has come on the record that Younas 
Habib, the principal actor in the whole drama has misused/ misappropriated 
huge sums of public money deposited in the Mehran Bank Limited, he should 
be further criminally prosecuted and necessary steps for retrieving the 
misappropriated amount be also initiated against him, three members of the 
commission said in their joint report.
    
We would also suggest that in view of the increasing evidence of white 
collar crimes such as bank frauds, punishment for such offences should be 
suitably enhanced, of course, by making necessary amendments in relevant 
law, they said.

<a name="iwas">I was not told by police before the action was planned</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied

KARACHI, Dec. 10: Testifying before the three-member tribunal investigating 
the cause of death of Mir Murtaza Bhutto and seven others, Tariq Niazi, 
said he as an area magistrate was not informed by the police before the 
action was planned against Murtaza and his companions on Sept 20.
    
He said neither the deputy commissioner of district south was informed 
about the planned action. The (police) did not inform me for which I cannot 
give any specific answer.
    
Q: Did you protest about this lapse ?
    
A: Yes, I told the DC about it and he also said it was strange that we were 
not informed.
    
Q: Are you aware of any inquiry held as to why the lights in the area were 
switched off ?
    
A: No, I am not aware of any such inquiry into the incident.
    
Q: Did you check the daily reports of the police station to find out the 
movements of the bodies ?
    
A: I did not, because the DC had already taken note of it.

Q: Did you visit the scene of the incident ?
    
A: No, because the DC had already visited the site.
    
Q: When you were there, why didnt you keep your eyes and ears open to see 
things which were very obvious, such as noting down the numbers of 
vehicles, and there were seven SDMs performing minor duties such as 
providing blood, arranging for the helicopter, making efforts for search of 
bodies, installing direct phone etc.
    
A: We were doing what the DC had asked us to do.
    
Q: What was the situation like at the Clifton helipad at the time of taking 
the body of Mir Murtaza to Larkana ?
    
A: An emotion-charged crowd of 2,000-3,000 was chanting anti-government and 
anti-police slogans. I could not control that crowd with the help of 30 
policemen and I pulled back the police force.
    
Q: Have you submitted the account to any other authorities other than the 
DC ?
    
A: No.

At this stage the tribunal felt that no useful information was forthcoming 
from the witnesses and nobody wants to share such information to enable us 
to come to some conclusion.
    
Q: When did you go to Clifton police station in search of bodies and what 
did you see ?
    
A: The SHO was not there and the duty officer was also not there. I looked 
around and there were no dead bodies there. I was told by the constables 
that they might have been taken to hospital from the scene of the incident 
and the other guards present there also gave the same answer.
    
Q: Did you check the lock-up at the police station ?
    
A: No.
    
Q: Did you check at Darakshan police station which is in the same compound 
?
    
A: No, I went back to MMC (Mideast Medical Centre) and at that time the DC 
knew that the bodies had already arrived at the JPMC mortuary.
    
Q: When you visited Clifton PS from MMC, did you see any obstruction on the 
road ?
    
A: I passed through the main road and three vehicles were stranded there, a 
blue Pajero, a Toyota Hi Lux and an small car. There was no traffic on the 
road as it was closed, and no police vehicles either. It was darkness all 
around and no lights which could illuminate the place.
    
Q: Did you see any dead body on the road ?

A: No, I saw pools of blood, patches of blood on the side of the vehicles 
and there were no police or rangers.
    
Q: What did you see when you reached the hospital where you were called by 
the DC ?
    
A: The DSP and I reached at the same time and the former asked me what was 
the problem to which I replied I dont know.
    
I went inside the ICU and was asked to call the anaesthetist, a thorasic 
surgeon and an ENT surgeon from JPMC, which I did. I saw Mir Murtaza 
gasping for breath, there was a wound on his neck and he was bleeding from 
mouth and nose.
    
Earlier, Ali Asghar Jatoi, special assistant to the managing director of 
MMC, Dr Abdul Ghaffar Jatoi, was examined for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. 
He said he heard the sound of gunshots at 8:35-8:45 pm and it was heavy and 
lasted about 10-12 minutes. It resumed after five minutes which was lighter 
and he did not visualise what had happened.
    
The witness, who was in his room at MMC, got down from the second floor at 
about 9:20 pm and saw Dr Ejaz Shamim, RMO, standing near a patient on a 
stretcher close to the lift. The patient was Mir Murtaza who had been 
profusely bleeding from mouth, nose and neck, and with his clothes drenched 
in blood, and was struggling to breathe.
    
He then made inquiries about Ashiq Hussain Jatoi, the PPP (SB) president of 
Hyderabad, because he always accompanied Mr Bhutto wherever he went. His 
brother, Dr Zahid Hussain Jatoi, had no knowledge about Ashiq and he was 
disturbed and the witness spent the whole night in search of the man.

<a name="chau">Chaudhris, Sharifs not defaulters </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Dec. 6: Punjab PML president Senator Chaudhry Shujaat Husain claims 
that neither his family nor that of Mian Nawaz Sharif is a defaulter in the 
light of the new presidential ordinance. Thus, they cannot be stopped from 
contesting the forthcoming elections.

Talking to newsmen, he welcomed the ordinance which amends various sections 
and clauses of the Representation of the Peoples Act, saying it would be 
an effective check against floor crossing and wasteful expenditure in 
elections. The caretaker government, the PML leader said, had taken a step 
which would have a very healthy impact.

Referring to the reports that Sharifs and Chaudhris were defaulters and 
thus ineligible to contest elections, Chaudhry Shujaat said the new 
ordinance negated the allegations against both the families.

Chaudhry Shujaat claimed that no government loan incurred by these families 
had been written off. Thus, under the law, they could not be branded 
defaulters. We dont fall in the category of defaulters. He said now
the character-assassination campaign unleashed by various quarters should 
come to an end.

As for the allegations levelled during PDF rule that the Chaudhris and the 
Sharifs were defaulters, Chaudhry Shujaat said these were baseless and 
engineered. He claimed that the then government had created a special 
situation to pin the blame on the two families. The PDF government, he 
alleged, refused working capital, cash financing and some other facilities 
to the industrial units of the two families and when these units were 
rendered incapable of returning loans, they were declared defaulters. We 
never refused to pay back the loans. We never got any loan written off, 
Chaudhry Shujaat said.

He alleged that the previous government had chalked out a plan to defame 
the industrialists as a class to distract public attention from the rampant 
corruption in which the rulers were involved.

Answering a question, the PML leader said his party would finalise its 
candidates for the national and the provincial assemblies by the time the 
Election Commission announced the election schedule.

<a name="pmln">PML-N invites other parties for alliance</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Dec. 8: The Pakistan Muslim League invited other parties, including 
those who have been strongly criticising it, for electoral adjustments, 
saying cooperation would not be possible if the opportunity was missed.

Without naming any party but leaving little doubt that he was referring to 
the Jamaat-i-Islami, the PML leader said certain parties had been using 
derogatory language against the PML. Still, he said, Mian Nawaz Sharif was 
a large-hearted politician and was ready to have electoral cooperation with 
such parties in the supreme national interests.

About the accountability, Chaudhry Shujaat said the accountability was a 
permanent process which could not be completed in a single day. The 
government should ensure that the process was not reduced to an eye wash.

He said his party was not afraid of any rival party or leader and it would 
have no objection if President Farooq Leghari, former prime minister 
Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif Zardari took part in elections. The 
people would let them know their worth.

He assured his partymen that election tickets would be awarded only to the 
deserving candidates. He said Mian Nawaz Sharif had gathered all 
information about applicants and he would select only those candidates who 
could serve the country better.

<a name="usau">US author fears of third force</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Dec. 9: US author and journalist Paula Newberg, who wrote the 
famous article The two faces of Benazir Bhutto predicted that if 
Pakistani politicians did not put their house in order, someone else 
might, and then no one will be satisfied.
    
In a lengthy piece in the Los Angeles Times headlined A familys 
travails threatens a nation, Ms Newberg said newspapers were openly 
surmising that the military might cancel the elections scheduled for 
February.
    
She observed that Pakistan was facing a crisis of governance. The 
governance crisis has landed in the laps of the World Bank and the IMF. 
Both want to balance the books by restructuring taxation and distribution 
but the non-interest of the wealthy in paying taxes and the political 
parties threats to scuttle any presidential commitments jeopardise this 
effort.
    
She described Pakistan's politics as high stakes politics, saying 
leaders who have not died in office have often been removed...corruption and 
government instability are constant reminders that while the country has 
grown exponentially and changed markedly, politics has not altered much 
from the 1950s.
    
Ms Newberg said the confusion about the presidents intentions was 
understandable. The caretakers are a motley crew, largely lacking 
ideology, relevant experience or organisation. This, she pointed out, 
contrasted markedly with the small cabinet of excellence assembled by 
former World Bank official Moeen Qureshi in 1993 which seems to have set a 
standard in the public mind.
    
While Asif Zardari and Ms Bhutto's other ministers were branded a rogue's 
gallery of self-enriching opportunists, she said, many officials also 
assumed to be corrupt, have retained their jobs. No one claims to know 
fully what is happening... Ms Bhutto has quickly donned a familiar cloak of 
political martyrdom...the presumption of guilt in dissolutions and 
detentions is already encountering difficulties...

<a name="wbwa">WB wants 40pc cut in staff of banks, DFIs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 10: The World Bank has set a reform package for Pakistan's 
financial sector seeking 40 percent cut in the workforce of major 
nationalised banks and closure of 20 percent of their branches as a 
precondition for the release of the proposed banking sector adjustment 
loan.
    
Source told Dawn that the World Bank specified 21 key actions for 
improving the countrys banking sector, which must be taken before the 
proposed loan could be presented before its board of executive directors.
    
They said the deadline for taking the key actions was Dec. 31, after which 
the proposed loan could be placed before the board on Jan 21. The key 
actions dictated by the Bank are:
    
 Prohibition of NBCs and DFIs from all project lending until they are 
privatised or liquidated;
    
 Change in the management of NCBs and DFIs and in the process for 
selecting and firing management to insulate it from political interference 
and base it solely on professional considerations;
    
 Imposition by the State Bank of rules and guidance for the governance of 
NCBs and DFIs for the period before privatisation to make certain that 
their managements function primarily as caretakers focusing on recovery of 
non-performing loans and preservation of assets;
    
 Reduction in the workforce of the HBL, NBP, NDFC, and RDFC by 40 percent, 
preferably through a severance payment programme, and imposition of a 
hiring freeze until they are privatised;
    
 Reduction of branches operated by the HBL, UBL, NBP and NDFC by 20 
percent by closing down units according to criteria defined by the SBP, and 
a freeze in the opening of new branches until they are privatised;
    
 Recovery from the stock of classified loans (estimated to be about Rs135 
billion) of at least 10 per cent, preferably from the largest defaulters, 
and a quarterly target of recoveries, including through the mechanism of an 
RTC.
    
 Initiation of liquidation proceedings for IDBP with the courts;
    
 Complete disinvestment of shares owned by the government or government 
controlled institutions in the MCB, ABL, PICIC and BEL;
    
 Sale of Habib Credit and Exchange Bank;
    
 Submission of a satisfactory privatisation plan for all NCBs and DFIs 
that includes the replacement of all classified assets, net of reserves and 
capital, by fully marketable government securities at market rates with a 
weighted maturity of no more than six years, at the time of privatisation, 
and the break-up of the HBL into two or three banks;
    
 Issuance of revised regulations on capital adequacy, loan classification 
and provisioning and interest accrual based on international standards and 
announcement of a satisfactory timetable by which all banks must comply;
    
 Requirement for all banks to uniformly follow international accounting 
standards and be audited according to international auditing standards, and 
announcement of a satisfactory timetable by which all banks must comply;
    
 Requirement for all banks to disclose provisioning, including related 
adjustment in net income, beginning in 1997;
    
 Recruitment by the SBP of an adequate number of skilled and experienced 
bank examiners locally and abroad;
    
 Abolition of the Pakistan Banking Council to unify bank supervision in 
SBP;
    
 Removal of controls on T-Bill auctions by pre-announcing volumes and 
taking up pre-announced volumes;
    
 Reduction in the liquidity reserve requirement of banks to 20 percent and 
announcement of a phase-down to 10 percent of demand deposits;
    
 Phase-out of mandatory and concessionary credits automatically refinanced 
by the SBP;
    
 Benchmarking the yields on the National Savings Schemes to market-
determined treasury bill rates;
    
 Enactment of appropriate ordinances to ensure that selection of 
management of state-owned banks and financial institutions is based on 
professional criteria and that these institutions are run without undue 
political interference; and to establish the autonomy of the SBP, in 
particular SBPs licensing and inspection powers; and
    
 Establishment of 35 fully operating banking courts with adequate budgets.
    
The sources said these actions were stated in a dispatch to the caretaker 
government sent on Nov. 26 by Mieko Nishimizu, director, country department 
I, South Asia Region, after reviewing the findings and recommendations of 
the bank mission.
    
They said the caretaker government preferred to exclude the NBP from the 
privatisation programme. The government also requested the mission to 
minimise the lay-off of redundant employees from the NCBs and DFIs, they 
added. However, the sources said, no agreement was reached on cut in the 
workforce. Similarly, no agreement was reached on measures to deal with the 
defaulters, they added.
    
Mr Nishimizu in his dispatch had urged the government to complete 
negotiations on a draft loan agreement, including a letter of development 
policy, by Dec. 13.
    
The sources said a high-level delegation, headed by the advisor to the 
prime minister on finance and economic affairs, was in Washington to hold 
talks with the World Bank. They said the caretaker government had already 
taken certain action as described by the bank. Pakistan would take up 
certain issues such as reduction in workforce and bank branches and try to 
get some concessions in this regard, they added.

<a name="rupe">Rupee revalued by 2.5% against $ in one month</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 9: Rupee was revalued by 2.5 percent against the dollar in 
kerb during the last one month as the US currency was said to be in 
oversupply because of a considerable fall in ready demand.
    
In a related development, Foreign Exchange Bearer Certificates (FEBC), tly 
traded on the open market, also eased by an identical percentage and were 
quoted at Rs 105.85 and Rs 106.00 for buying and selling respectively.
    
The decline in value of the dollar was more pronounced during the last 
three sessions as it has lost 35 paisa or over one percent against the 
rupee, dealers said. Another reason behind the current fall was a 
significant cut in the wedge between the official and kerb spot rates from 
Rs 3.50 to Rs 2.05, leaving a little profit margin for speculative currency 
traders, they stated.

<a name="the1">The 13th faultline in the economy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

THE CARETAKER finance ministry is mobilising about $ 500 million through 
swap arrangement reportedly at the generous rate of 22 percent. This 
would effectively devalue the rupee by at least 8 percent.
    
Meanwhile, the caretaker finance ministry advisor, Shahid Javed Burki has 
announced the good tidings that the UAE government has expressed its 
intention of making available to Pakistan as much as $350 million in 
balance of payments (BoP) support. He, however, did not say on what terms. 
If one went by the record of previous governments in such cases, the 
proposed balance of payment support from UAE would certainly carry an 
interest rate of at least about 10 percent over Libor which would cause 
further devaluation of the rupee by at least about 4 to 5 percent.
    
Earlier, he had informed the nation the wonderful news that the IMF had 
agreed to disburse by the middle of December more than $160 million from 
the suspended standby arrangement.
    
When newspaper reports said that, despite Mr. Burkis optimism, the Fund 
would not release more than one-third of the withheld $160 million after 
its Board meeting, the government in order to confuse the issue got the 
local IMF office to release the following terse statement: Following 
recent IMF staff talks with the Pakistani authorities, the IMFs executive 
board is expected to consider an extension of the current stand-by credit, 
as well as an increase in the total amount available thereunder. The board 
is expected to meet in the second week of December for this purpose.
    
This statement gives no indication about the amount to be released 
immediately after the board meeting. It only reiterated the Funds promise 
to consider the request of Pakistan for an extension of the current 
standby expiring in March, 1997 as well as an increase in the total amount 
available thereunder.

Caretakers desperation
    
In the backdrop of the reassurance of sorts from the IMF and rather a 
generous offer of $350 million from UAE it looked rather odd to see the 
finance ministry trying to arrange a paltry sum of $500 million at the cost 
of the rupees rate of exchange which has serious inflationary import. 
However, this desperation on the part of the caretakers becomes 
understandable if the reports that Pakistan would not get more than about 
$60 million in December are true.
    
The IMF in its annual report issued earlier this year had asked Pakistan 
(page 86) to do the following to qualify for the suspended standby 
arrangement: 1. Remove regulatory duty, 2. reduce further the tariff rates; 
3. impose general sales across the board (later they asked for reduction in 
the highest rate to 15 per cent and the number of rates to three from 
four); 4.impose agriculture tax; 5.phase out tax exemptions and 
concessions; 6. rationalise military expenditure, and 7. increase the 
amount in the development budget.
    
The package of measures announced by the previous government on October 22, 
1996 and which has been kept intact by the caretakers had instead proposed 
considerable decreases in the development budget (Rs 21 billion), and did 
not propose any phasing out of tax exemptions and concessions, did not 
decrease the highest GST rates or reduce the number of rates to three and 
neither did it propose to reduce the tariff further and nor did it remove 
the regulatory duty. And the package did not even mention the military 
budget.
    
Therefore, it is assumed by some circles that the Fund despite its polite 
sounds (misunderstood as approval) about the proposed package was in no 
mood to bail out Pakistan at such a critical juncture in its financial 
history.

Meaningful steps
    
The caretakers, instead of taking meaningful steps to win back the 
confidence of the Fund, have effected hefty increases in the administered 
prices during the first month of their three month tenure and continued to 
borrow from the banking sector in the same manner as did the previous 
governments.
    
What is keeping the caretakers from taking all those steps which the 
caretaker Advisor on Finance and Economic Affairs, Shahid Javed Burki, had 
listed in his article of August 24, 1995 (Dawn, A three-part plan of 
action)?
    
According to Mr Burkis own admission (Prerequisites for development  
Dawn, August 25, 1996),  ...our leaders have not been able to arrive at a 
political consensus without which no programme of structural reforms can 
succeed. If such a consensus was not available on August 24, 1996  
after nearly 50 years  the caretakers can hardly hope to get one during 
their limited tenure. So, the difficulty in carrying out Burkis agenda of 
reforms, perhaps.
    
Another matter which needs to be taken notice of is Mr. Burkis stand on 
military expenditure before and after he joined the government.
    
Before he joined the caretaker set-up he had said: However, even within 
the current definition of Pakistans strategic requirements, it would be 
appropriate for the military to conduct the same kind of expenditure review 
on waste as is required of the civil administration. (A three-part plan of 
action  Dawn, August 24)
    
After he became the caretaker finance adviser, he told a group of economic 
writers (November 30, 1996) that the matter of military expenditure should 
be left to the judgment of the military strategists.
    
On the day he expressed his first opinion he was talking like an economic 
expert with full knowledge of the thinking on this subject in the 
multilateral agencies like the World Bank and IMF. But when he became a 
full fledged representative of Pakistans Establishment, he spoke like a 
typical politician interested only in his job, no matter even if it is only 
for three months. He can now bag a lucrative international job with the 
qualification of being an ex-finance adviser of the Government of Pakistan.

Military expenditure
    
There is no way Pakistans fiscal problems could be resolved overnight 
without first rationalising the military expenditure or as Mr Burki 
suggested in his article, by conducting expenditure review on waste.
    
Who does not know that millions are being siphoned off every year from the 
military budget without let or hindrance behind the excuse of secrecy. The 
commissions and kickbacks involved in military contracts are a legend 
needing no proof. 
   
This has to be looked into in order to rationalise the military expenditure 
without blunting our defensive teeth.
    
In the same article he said: No source of income should be exempt from 
taxation .... the distinction between agricultural and non- agricultural 
should be done away with and the incomes that accrue from land should be 
brought within the ambit of tax system.
    
What is stopping the caretakers from doing all this through a presidential 
ordinance? Political expediency? In fact the two packages of incentives 
announced by the caretakers, one for the APTMA and the other for stock 
exchanges appear to be a transparent attempt to win the political support 
of the richest people of this country.
    
If not all the caretakers, at least Mr Burki should have known that you 
simply cannot revive any of the so-called emerging stock markets with any 
kind of incentives after the Mexico debacle.
    
In the pre-Mexico days, emerging markets were considered attractive by the 
international investors because they could buy big chunks of blue chips at 
highly depressed prices and then do profit selling in a market going up in 
response to the entry into the market of these very investors.
    
Most of the local private enterprises listed on Pakistani stock exchanges 
are 100 per cent family owned. Therefore, even with the most attractive 
incentive package, there would hardly be any noticeable activity on the 
local markets.

Vibrant sectors
 
Further down in his August 24 article, Mr Burki discovers that there are 
several other sectors of the economy which have managed to escape the 
fiscal net. 
 
These are more vibrant sectors and include such activities as small-scale 
commerce and small-scale industry. Why hasnt he taxed these sectors so 
far. He cannot be waiting for the restoration of the assemblies or 
elections to have the relevant legislation passed. He only has three months 
to do this. One month has already gone by.
    
On the issue of tax administration he had said: Without a credible effort 
at tax collection the government will not be able to take care of the 
serious problem... A relatively inexpensive project that computerised tax 
collection which, in turn, facilitated the ability of the tax collectors to 
undertake cross-checking of the returns submitted by the tax payers were 
some of the more important elements of this reform effort (World Bank aided 
reform in Argentina). So far, nothing has happened on this front too.
    
On the issue of State Banks autonomy, Mr Burki had suggested in writing, a 
totally autonomous central bank and a politically immune governor of the 
bank controlling without any interference from the government of the day, 
the inflation in the country and the credit policy. So far, the State Bank 
and its governor have seen no changes for the better.
     
The government is still resorting to bank borrowing for budgetary purposes.

Power of elite
    
In Mr Burkis opinion, the State Bank should not be involved in regulating 
the commercial banks. For this purpose he had proposed the establishment of 
a new institution that has the sole function and full authority and 
accountability, and total autonomy to regulate and supervise the banking 
sector.....all banks should be subject to the accounting principles being 
followed by the banks in the United States.
 
These principles go under the title of US GAAP  or generally accepted 
accounting principles. Where is the proposed institution? Instead he has 
ordered dismantling of the existing institution, the Banking Council, and 
resorted to the same old trick of replacing one set of scoundrels (theirs) 
with another set (ours) in the nationalised banks and investment 
institutions.
    
The dozen faultlines of the Pakistani economy which Shahid Javed Burki had 
so succinctly described in his first article on August 5, 1996 (Dawn), have 
seemingly now been joined by one more, that is himself.
    
What was the purpose of writing these articles, Mr. Burki, if not to put 
your sure shot remedies to work when you got a god sent opportunity exactly 
three months later? Perhaps you were looking for no more than a three-month 
winter vacation job.
    
Or perhaps you had no idea about your own limitations or the power of the 
Pakistani ruling elite and the permanent establishment.

<a name="newa">New accounting device to camouflage losses</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dilawar Hussain

For financial year 1995, the Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP) 
posted net profit of Rs 93.5 million: It had actually suffered a mind-
boggling loss of Rs 233.4 million- but could avoid the red through a 
timely change in accounting policy for valuation of investments.
    
The ICP did make provision of a huge Rs 78.5 million for diminution in 
value of quoted shares, which were carried on the balance sheet at Rs 
1,577.7 million against cost of Rs 1,656.3 million. But that year, the 
Corporation changed its accounting policy for valuation of quoted 
investments to lower of book and market value determined on aggregate 
portfolio basis, from earlier policy of valuing investments individually at 
lower of book and market value.
    
Auditors, A.F.Ferguson & Co. said they concurred with the change but 
calculated that had there been no change in the accounting policy, the 
profit for the year and carrying value of investments would have been lower 
by Rs 326.9 million. How many of the investors out there would know that 
had the financial statements been prepared in accordance with the 
accounting policies consistently applied, the ICP would have been in deep 
red in 1995 and the cash dividend at 12 per cent would have been in 
jeopardy.
    
All users of financial statements and particularly the small investors in 
stocks and mutual funds are not likely to be accounting experts and may not 
be able to read between the lines. Many may take the financial statements 
on the face value. The question then arises whether such timely 
accounting somersaults that radically change the financial picture- though 
absolutely by the book- do or do not tantamount to misleading shareholders?
    
The question assumes considerable significance as ICPs is not the lone 
case. The protracted bearish spell at the stock market has forced more 
companies than ever before to search for (legal) ways to skip the provision 
of losses on investments and yet be able to obtain unqualified reports from 
statutory auditors, certifying that the accounts present true and fair 
view of companys affairs and profit for the period.
    
In the bull markets of late 1993 and early 1994, numerous corporate 
entities with surplus cash and probably shorter foresight, diverted their 
money from fixed income securities to stocks. As the shares began shedding 
values, those who were quick to sense the advent of the bears, got out 
unscathed or slightly hurt. Others who dilly-dallied, were badly bruised.
    
The investment portfolios of scores and scores of listed companies are now 
worth only a shade of their actual cost. As a prudent accounting 
practice, such losses due to diminution in value of investments (difference 
between the cost of acquisition and market value at reporting date) ought 
always to be reflected in the profit and loss accounts.
    
But numerous companies have engineered several ways to dodge the loss. 
Thus, profits posted by such companies and certified as true by their 
statutory auditors, are grossly unrepresentative of the factual position; 
profits have been inflated, profits have been shown where there are none, 
or even loss represented as profit. All dependent on how the company chose 
to treat the all important item: diminution in value of investments.
    
Study of several cases- selected at random- shows that managements have 
exercised several options; Some companies do account for the plunge in 
prices of their portfolio, others provide only a part of the losses and yet 
others have chosen to sweep the issue under the carpet.
    
There are apparently no guidelines from professional bodies such as the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP) or Institute of Cost 
and Management Accountants (ICMAP)) or the corporate monitors (CLA, KSE 
etc) on how companies should treat the diminution in value of investments 
in their financial statements. The reference is almost always made to the 
International Accounting Standards (IAS).
    
And IAS-25 relating to Accounting for Investments simply lays down: 
Marketable equity securities should be treated at the lower of cost and 
market value determined on a portfolio basis. Professional accountants 
interpret the rule in various ways. It all depends on the accounting 
policies of individual companies, says Suleman Lalani, Associate chartered 
accountant (ACA) and secretary to a large brokerage house.
    
He explained that as a general rule, if the investment was for a short term 
(marketable securities), diminution in value of investment ought to be 
provided, while the provision could be skipped if the investment was for a 
longer period. Ostensibly this is on the premise that loss would be 
recovered during the term of holding of such investment.
    
Many companies have bent this rule to the breaking point: First UDL 
Modaraba reported net loss of Rs 2.5 million for the Jan-June period of 
this year. The company had invested Rs 182.6 million (at cost) in quoted 
companies and modarabas. Market value, as at the close of balance sheet, 
was reported to have plummeted to Rs 109.8 million, reflecting loss of Rs 
72.8 million or 39.9 per cent of the actual cost.
    
In order to escape the provision for diminution, the company simply re-
located the investments from previously shown current assets side (as 
short-term investments) to long term investments. Had the company provided 
the diminution in value of investments, the profit and loss account for the 
period would have shown loss of staggering Rs 70.3 million instead of the 
reported tiny deficit of Rs 2.5 million. Similar accounting policy was 
followed by Ibrahim Textiles Limited, which decreased its short-term 
investment on the balance sheet from Rs 149.8 million at March 31, 1994, to 
Rs 90.9 million at the same time in 1995 and shifted it to long term 
investment, which jumped up from Rs 5 to Rs 188.1 million, thereby avoiding 
the provision of loss of value of investments.
    
Yusuf Textile Mills had invested Rs 9.8 million in shares of associated, 
Indus Dyeing & Manufacturing Company. The market value receded 55 per cent 
to Rs 4.4 million, but the company did not provide for diminution and the 
companys auditors raised no objection on the plea that management had told 
them that these were sponsors controlling holding and as such carried much 
higher value than the market price. However, when the company did dispose 
off the shares in 1995, it fetched only the prevailing market price and the 
company had to book loss on sale of Rs 5.4 million.
    
Atlas Investment Bank showed Investment in quoted shares and bonds at Rs 
137.7 million at June 30, 1996; Aggregate market value at that date stood 
at Rs 83.9 million; the Bank did not provide diminution in value amounting 
to Rs 53.8 million, saying that it is considered temporary in the context 
of the companys intention to hold these investments on a long term basis.
    
The entire investment in shares and bonds was shown as long term investment 
with nothing of quoted stock and bonds in short term. For the 18 months to 
end-June, the Bank unveiled after tax profit at Rs 15.8 million. Consider 
this against the huge loss of Rs 53.8 million in the form of diminution in 
value of the portfolio and how the bottom line would have looked like, had 
the provision been made.
    
It is understandable, however, why companies with public stakes are loathe 
to show diminished profits or losses replacing profits, especially banks, 
insurance companies, modarabas, leasing and other financial services 
companies that depend on public confidence for business. And these are the 
very companies whose portfolio overwhelmingly comprise the investment in 
company equities. While most leasing companies such as NDLC had as much as 
60 per cent exposure in the laggard textile sector in early 1994, textile 
companies with surplus funds had taken stakes in the other worst performing 
sector: the modarabas. Both have come to grief.
    
Through the devise- though ofcourse perfectly legal- of change in 
accounting policies and relocation of investments all companies 
could gloss over the financial picture, but many have opted to follow the 
prudent course: Crescent Investment Bank Limited provided a whopping Rs 165.3 
million for diminution in value of investments against the profit for the 
18 months to end-June 1996. Though this slashed the Banks 1995-96 after 
tax profit to Rs 78.3 million against Rs 221.5 million for the year before, 
the Bank preferred to carry the balance sheet figure of investment at Rs 
840.1 million, reflecting the actual market worth of investments and not at 
cost at Rs 1,005.4 million.
    
Securities and Broking firm, Javed Omer Vohra & Company Ltd. provided Rs 
30.5 million for diminution in 1996 accounts, adjusting the balance sheet 
figure of marketable securities from cost Rs 142.7 million to market value 
at Rs 113.3 million. In the process, the company had to show loss of Rs 3.4 
million for 1996 against net profit of Rs 1 million in 1995.
    
National Development Leasing Corporation (NDLC), the pioneer in the leasing 
sector, posted pretax profit at Rs 83.8 million after provision of Rs 14.2 
million for permanent diminution in value of investment in 
July-December six months of 1995. The company had provided Rs 36.2 million 
in the corresponding six months of 1994 period, making an aggregate provision 
of a startling Rs 50 million to end-December 1995. This enabled the company to 
show marketable securities (listed companies/modarabas) on the balance 
sheet at actual market price of Rs 71.9 million at that date.
    
Between those who have provided the loss of value of investments in full 
and those who have made none, there are companies which have taken the 
middle course. The Bawany group company, Reliance Insurance Company had 
investment (at book value) of Rs 32.3 million in quoted shares/NIT units at 
December 31, 1995. These carried the market value of Rs 28.3 million at 
that date, reflecting diminution in value by Rs 4 million. The company 
provided Rs 2 million in the 1995 accounts, one-half of the actual loss of 
value. The short provision, enabled the company to show 4 per cent growth 
in after tax profit for the year to Rs 10.5 million from Rs 10.0 million 
the earlier year. Provision in full would have resulted in showing lower 
than earlier years net profit.
    
First International Investment Bank (FIIB) of the Babar Ali group provided 
Rs 1.8 million as diminution of value in trading investment in its 
latest accounts to June 30, 1996. The Bank reclassified Rs 42.9 million worth 
of shares from trading to long term investment and changed accounting policy 
for long term quoted investments from the lower of aggregate cost and 
market value to cost contending that the management considered 
that it presented a more realistic position; had the accounting policy 
remained unchanged, the long term investments would have stood reduced by 
Rs 19.6 million. The company however, provided adjustments of Rs 7.1 
million to lower cost and market value of trading investment transferred to 
long term investment.
    
And then there are other interesting cases as well. Prudential Stocks Fund 
Limited for the six months July-December 1995 unveiled pre-tax profit at Rs 
1 million. This though only a half of the profit of Rs 2 million earned in 
the corresponding period of the previous year, was not remotely as poor as 
it would otherwise have been had the company shown huge loss of Rs 27.5 
million suffered in the diminution in value of marketable securities. The 
company had stakes in marketable securities at the aggregate cost of Rs 
61.1 million but at the market price on balance sheet date, the portfolio 
had plunged to Rs 33.6 million.
    
Ingeniously, the company booked the loss of Rs 27.5 million in value of 
securities, but without showing such loss on the face of the profit and 
loss account. Thus securities were shown at market value on the assets side 
of balance sheet and the difference between cost and market value (Rs 27.5 
million) was adjusted on the liabilities side, against the small surplus of 
Rs 0.9 million brought forward from previous year and leaving the balance 
Rs 26.6 million as accumulated loss. By such extra-accounting 
method, the company managed to book the loss on the balance sheet but at the 
same time show on the profit & loss account a profit of Rs 2 million for the 
six months, in place of the actual loss of Rs 25.5 million.
    
The question of provision of diminution in value of securities is a subject 
of heated debate at meetings in numerous board rooms. The onus clearly lies 
with the Corporate Law Authority and the Institute of Chartered Accountants 
of Pakistan to issue unambiguous guidelines on how such losses should be 
(uniformly) treated in the financial statements.
    
It should be specified which investment constitutes long and which short 
term investments; whether a company is at liberty to dispose off long term 
investments earlier than a year and would diminution in investment become 
permanent and be provided for in case long term investment in a 
company remains unchanged for more than three years. Also, what would be the 
impact if the company does not liquidate marketable securities during 
the course of an accounting year.
    
There doubtless is virtue in outlining such prudent accounting policies 
where all losses are promptly booked, irrespective of the unsavoury impact 
on the current financial statements. It has to be realised that in the 
absence of accounting policy for uniform treatment, comparisons between 
companies in the same sector becomes impossible and the profit and loss 
accounts and balance sheets of scores of companies could be all, but 
misleading.

<a name="list">List of 40,000 defaulters to be disclosed next week</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 10 : The caretaker government has prepared a list of 40,000 
defaulters of banks and the DFIs who would be debarred from taking part in 
the election if they fail to repay their dues. The list will be made public 
early next week.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that whosoever had taken loan of half a million 
rupees or above would be subjected to strict scrutiny by the Election 
Commission. The Election Commission has reluctantly accepted the 
responsibility of monitoring the plan to ensure that no defaulter took part 
in the February 3 polls.
    
Most of the politicians have received loans from the Industrial 
Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP) and face disqualification if they do 
not repay their loans, said an official.
    
According to the latest figures, the banks and the DFIs have to recover 
about Rs.130 billion most of which is owed by about 40,000 defaulters.

<a name="expo">Exports fall 1.2% in Nov. despite devaluations</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 11: Pakistans exports declined by 1.2 percent during 
November, 1996, when compared with October, 1996, (from $666 million in 
October to $658 million), in spite of multiple devaluation of the rupee, 
according to official figures.
    
The multiple devaluation includes two major devaluations, first by 3.65 
per cent in September and then 8.5 percent on October 22, which failed to 
achieve any breakthrough in exports.
    
The import bill of Pakistan in dollar terms during a single month also 
dropped sharply by 14 percent to $961 million from $1.11 billion in 
October. Overall, in last five months, from July to November, the trade gap 
swelled to over $1.5 billion as against $1.30 billion suffered in the same 
period of 1995.
    
The import bill during the last five months was $4.75 billion while the 
export earnings amounted to $3.24 billion. As against this, the total 
imports in the same period of 1995 was $4.54 billion while exports had 
fetched $2.79 billion.
    
In the last five months, exports rose by about 16 percent while imports 
showed a sluggish growth of less than five percent, which is a key factor 
to keep trade deficit within the manageable limits. Further, analysis 
indicates that November witnessed a sharp drop in imports of all the 
categories except chemical fertilisers and pulses, which increased by 3.82% 
and 27.1% respectively.
    
During the five-month period of this year, the import, in dollar terms, of 
machinery excluding transport equipment declined by 11.15% over the 
corresponding period of last year, that of industrial raw materials 
/intermediate goods including plastic material dropped by 23.9%, medicinal 
products by 12.8%, iron & steel by 14.8%, synthetic & artificial silk yarn 
by 2.6%, synthetic fibre by 22% and rubber crude by 9.5%.
    
The import of petroleum crude has dropped by 8% in quantitative terms. 
There was a 24.4% increase in import of wheat. The exports dropped from 
68.2% during the first five months of the previous financial year to 61.5% 
in the corresponding period current year.
    
During July-October, 1996, the share of manufactured goods in exports was 
60.2%. It dropped to 59.8% in July-November, 1996. However, when compared 
with the period July-November, 1995, these categories accounted for 57.3%.
    
The value-added textiles improved their share in total exports from 45.8% 
in July-November, 1995, to 48.4% in the corresponding period of current 
year. In absolute terms, their exports stood at $1.28 billion and $1.57 
billion, respectively. All the manufactured textile categories have 
recorded a sizeable positive growth.
    
Manufactures other than textiles also increased their exports from $0.32 to 
$0.37 billion. Highest increase (35%) has been registered by carpets which 
fetched $67.2 million. The tarpaulin & canvas goods, however, continue on a 
downward swing, suffering a decline of 37.7% in dollar terms and 27.4% 
quantitatively.
    
Cotton yarn continued its position as the top earner of foreign exchange
about $553 million, that is 11.29% more than last year. Thus this item, 
involving a nominal value-addition, accounted for 17% of total exports.
    
The statistics show that the rice has suffered a sizeable drop in its unit 
value. The total quantity of rice exported during July-November, 1996, was 
0.43 million tonnes, 3.3% less than during the corresponding period of last 
year. But in dollar terms, the accrual therefrom was $141.6 million, lower 
by 5.5%, as compared to last year.
    
As regards raw cotton, the statistics report 95% drop in exports. Only 
1,232 tons have been exported this year, as compared to 25,011 tons during 
July-November, 1995.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 11: Stock prices eased across a broad front but selling was 
not that aggressive as it has been during the last few sessions.
    
The index was last quoted lower by 6.99 points at 1,409.70 as compared to 
1,416.69 a day earlier, reflecting the relative weakness of some other base 
shares.
    
Floor brokers said the current uncertainty is expected to prevail until the 
Supreme Courts verdict on the dissolution petitions as it will clear the 
way for long-term planning. They said the sentiment in part is also 
affected by the stock exchange elections due on December 15 as most of the 
leading members are busy campaigning for their respective candidates.
    
Leading shares again finished lower but this time mostly fractionally. The 
markets resistance to larger decline was led by Hub-Power, which came in 
for active short-covering at the lower level and though finished 
fractionally higher.
    
All the leading shares suffered fresh decline, although most of them 
fractionally. Most of the MNCs, however, remained under pressure and fell 
further by one rupee to Rs 6, the biggest fall being again in the Parke-
Davis, which had fallen by over Rs 50 during the last couple of weeks. 
Others to follow it included Lever Brothers, BOC Pakistan, Reckitt and 
Colman, Siemens Pakistan, Pak-Suzuki Motors and PSO, falling by one rupee 
to Rs 3.
    
Dadabhoy Insurance led the list of local leading shares, falling by Rs 7, 
followed by ICP SEMF, Javed Omer, KASB & Co, Premier Insurance, Gadoon 
Textiles, Pakistan Refinery, Pakland Cement and Dewan Salman, closing with 
fall ranging from one rupee to Rs 7.
    
A total of 40 shares were traded, out of the total 306 actives. Leading 
gainers among them were Pak Apex Leasing, Adamjee Insurance, Hinopak 
Motors, Dadabhoy Sack and First ICP Mutual Fund, which posted gains ranging 
from one rupee to Rs 3.75.
    
A cash dividend of 8.5 percent from the Board of Directors of Confidence 
Modaraba was good but it failed to enthuse investors. Its shares, ruling 
around Rs 5, also remained dormant at Rs 5 without any transaction.
    
Trading volume showed a modest increase over the previous figure at 36.552 
million shares as compared to 32.070m shares a day earlier, thanks to 
active short-covering in Hub-Power, which was traded higher by 25 paisa on 
11.335m shares. Other actively traded shares were led by PTC vouchers, 
lower 15 paisa on 8.167m shares, ICI Pakistan, lower 40 paisa on 5.112m, 
Dhan Fibre, off 25 paisa on 2.170m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, up 25 paisa on 
1.8836m, and Ibrahim fibre, lower 30 paisa on 0.347m shares. There were 
some other notable deals also.
    
There were 306 actives out of which 197 shares fell, 40 rose with 69 
holding on to the last levels.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

EMPIRES have been lost, countries have disintegrated, as did this country 
in 1971. Kings have been crowned and deposed and beheaded. Heirs to 
kingdoms have been hanged, garrotted, blinded, imprisoned, poisoned. 
Leaders have been made and unmade. Politicians, men and women, have risen 
and fallen.
    
Of late, more women have led governments in South Asia than in any other 
region of the world. Now, with the dismissal of Benazirs arrogant, 
autocratic, corruption-riddled government, anyone writing on feminist 
history needs to take a hard look at how these women, some stupid, some 
clever, have ruled.
    
When they burst upon the scene, the Westerners, observing them from afar, 
consider them to be charismatic agents of refreshing change, banishers of 
tyrannies, pure and untainted, champions of liberty and of the freedom of 
the people. Most of these women have been mothers, widows, and daughters 
thrust into power by pseudo-dynastic imperatives when there have been no 
adequate males at hand. When the electioneering hectoring ceases, they 
return to their traditional ways, laden with the baggage of mainstream 
political parties and their corrupt patronage systems fuelled by long lists 
of political debts.
    
The women learnt the rules growing up at their fathers knee or by their 
husbands side. The issues are old ones, and it has been their lot to lead 
some of the worlds poorest countries. Stupid or clever, they have had 
little impact on economic or social problems, such as population control, 
education, womens rights, human rights, and the welfare of the people 
at large.
    
Benazir was not alone in all this. Indira Gandhi ended her long tenure in 
1984 in a hail of assassins bullets, leaving a legacy of subverted 
democratic institutions and bags full of dirty tricks played on her people 
and on weaker neighbouring nations.
    
Benazir, since her dismissal, has done nothing but rant and rave, as is her 
wont. All quite justifiable. After all, for the second time she has lost 
the top job into which she was placed by dint of her heritage, on the 
shoulders of a hanged father to whom the nation felt it owed a debt. Father 
Zulfikar at least worked his way up the ladder, starting his political 
career as the favourite of Iskander Mirza and his wife and, on the latters 
recommendation, the former gave him a firm foothold by making him his 
minister of commerce.
    
Benazir started her political career at the pinnacle, as a prime minister, 
and as happens in countries such as ours, she was swamped and suffocated by 
sycophants. Her first misadventure was calamitous, she learnt nothing from 
it, and her second performance proved incalculably more disastrous, with 
all her previous wrongs wildly exaggerated and increased, ending with her 
bringing the country to its knees  economically, politically and morally.
    
Apart from the country, what has she done to her children? Shortly after 
her second dismissal, she told the world, on Reuters television, that she 
had advised her children on how to deal with any taunts there may be from 
schoolmates because their mother was no longer prime minister. She told 
them to say, So what? She has been prime minister twice. How often has 
your mother been prime minister? Arrogant mother Benazir felt sure that 
this advice gave them a sense of relief, comfort and confidence. Was 
it not grossly unwise of her, as a mother, to convey to them that the prime 
ministership was her birthright, that they all would have lived happily in 
the state-owned mansion for ever and ever, had a naughty, nasty man not 
turfed her out wrongly and undeservedly?
    
Her main target has been and continues to be what she tells us she 
considers to be her former lackey, her faithful number two man, whom she 
only elevated to the presidency as he had promised that he would not do 
what he has done, i.e. dismiss her. She forgot the old saying that the worm 
often turns. She is on record as having said, in one of her wilder and less 
sane moments, that had she made Ms Naheed Khan the president both she 
(Benazir) and the country would have been far better off. Earlier in the 
year, in an equally unbalanced Caligula-like barb directed at the 
judiciary, she stated that she was contemplating making Jehangir Badar 
Chief Justice of Pakistan.
    
The fact is that Benazir and her government are gone, and the fact is that 
almost the entire country was anxiously waiting for her to go, and was 
relieved when Leghari finally did his bit for the Republic and the people. 
She thinks she is coming back, that she will be restored to her former 
glory, but it is hard to imagine she will be brought back to continue the 
rack and ruin.
    
Leghari acted later than he should have, many say. Whatever she may tell us 
he is, he is no cattle-rustler, camel thief, or ironmonger. He was to the 
manor born and is the Tumandar of his tribe. Prodded he may have been, but 
he has shouldered his responsibility and cobbled together a caretaker 
government, which, whatever it may be, holds at least a two-point higher 
rating than did the dismissed freely and fairly elected government.
    
The Tumandar has been foolish in so far as the statements he has allowed 
his spokesmen to issue on his behalf in response to the PPP attack upon his 
having built in the Aiwan a swimming pool and installed a shooting range. 
Everyone knows he is a sportsman, the man looks fit (he does not have a 
bulging belly hanging over his belt), and he is quite right in wanting to 
keep himself trim. As the head of state, he could hardly be expected to go 
to a club swimming pool. Why could he not just have said, yes, I have built 
myself a swimming pool, I need the exercise, and the pool will remain as 
useful an attribute to the Presidential Aiwan long after I have gone. The 
shooting range will also be there when he leaves. He is also a keen 
horseman and the people would not mind him stabling his favourite charger 
(just one) in the grounds of the Aiwan.
    
As for the 30,000 acres in Balochistan, he has done wrong. All that can be 
said in his favour is that he went to court and did not just grab it. The 
big question is, why did Leghari wait until he was president to act as he 
did?
    
He and his caretakers are less blemished than those three freely and 
fairly elected governments that we have had since 1988. If they can clean 
up the filth and the mess while they are with us, if they can put the 
country on the right track, people will forgive them for their 
shortcomings. If they cannot, they should not be where they are. For the 
time being, we accept most of them, but with reservation. A few are 
unacceptable. However, one month is far too short a time to clean up the 
dirt and to restore order. Even three months is insufficient. A job half 
done is no good.
    
The sole purpose of the Constitution is the betterment of the lot of the 
people. It cannot, in any way, be read or used to the detriment of the 
people. There are three things that are sacred to a nation  its 
constitution, the confidence it inspires in the people, and the way it is 
administered or enforced. If it can only be interpreted in the way it has 
been over the past eight years, then this is not the Constitution we should 
have. If this interpretation be correct, and if the Constitution can only 
bring about the harm and chaos that it has, it must either be done away 
with or amended and amended again and again. If it has been wrongly 
interpreted and administered, then those responsible must never be allowed 
to do the same again.
    
The caretakers should look into this and do their duty, one way or another. 
They must also do their duty to see that a census is conducted and a full 
accountability process undergone and executed before any further elections 
are held. They must do this by legal means, or by innovating, by 
improvising. They must be dedicated and determined to do what is right by 
this country and its people.

This should surprise nobody, given the disparate nature and ambitions of 
the team put together by Mr Leghari and Mr Meraj Khalid. When Mr Moeen 
Qureshi parachuted into Islamabad three years ago, nobody seriously doubted 
his intentions of holding elections. People questioned his right to 
initiate a number of steps like publishing lists of loan defaulters and 
tax-dodgers, but nobody accused his cabinet of harbouring personal 
political goals.
    
The same cannot be said of the current crew. By picking a number of active 
(albeit marginalised) politicians, the PM has guaranteed that his brief 
tenure will be highly controversial. Already, a number of the caretakers 
are beginning to sound as though they were on the campaign trail. The Sindh 
chief minister, in particular, has spotted a very real opportunity of 
staying on in his office after February by cobbling together an alliance 
with Ghinva Bhutto and the MQM, thus keeping the PPP out of power in Sindh. 
After two decades in the political wilderness, he is determined to grab 
this chance with both hands.
    
At the same time, the group of unelectable ministers and advisers are 
pressing for accountability before elections in the full knowledge 
that this would push the elections back. But although they would never admit 
it, this is precisely what they want. There are thus two totally divergent 
schools of thought in the caretaker team, and hence the conflicting signals 
they are sending out.
    
Another factor compounding this confusion is the somewhat bizarre decision 
to undertake nothing short of the restructuring of the entire Pakistani 
economy. Although this is far removed from the original mandate of the 
caretakers to hold elections and avert a looming economic collapse, Mr 
Shahid Javed Burki and his band of whiz-kids have taken it upon themselves 
to initiate sweeping reforms. A multitude of task forces are examining 
everything from pension funds to fiscal laws. How and why the caretakers 
are getting into policy decisions that will require years to implement is 
not clear. Mr Burki has made several pronouncements on the state of the 
economy under the Bhutto government; even if we accept his version, all we 
want him to do is put the economy back on an even keel: we do not expect 
him to completely overhaul it in three short months.
    
The recent arrest of Mr Wajid Shamsul Hasan is an indication of how 
desperate this government is to somehow, anyhow, justify the extreme step 
of dissolving the assemblies. Here is our accredited envoy to the Court of 
St James being harassed and jailed without giving him a chance to explain. 
The British detectives who were called in to investigate Murtaza Bhuttos 
murder have stated that they have been paid in full, so what embezzlement 
has taken place? At most, Mr Wajid Hasan may be guilty of committing a 
technical accounting error, but he is no accountant. He is, however, an 
upright man I have known for years, and I refuse to believe that he  
unlike many in his party  could have stooped to pocketing government 
funds. It is disgraceful that an honourable man should be dragged through 
the muck because of his political beliefs and his loyalty to the ex- prime 
minister.
    
Indeed, by hyping up the whole accountability issue, the caretakers have 
created a problem for themselves. They are discovering  as many of their 
predecessors did  that it is one thing to know that somebody is corrupt, 
and quite a different matter to prove it in a court of law. Although a 
number of bureaucrats have been arrested under the conveniently vague 
Maintenance of Public Order (MPO), very little hard evidence seems to have 
emerged. I suspect they are being pressed to implicate Asif Zardari. 
Although it goes against my liberal grain, I must confess that in this 
particular case, the end justifies the means.
    
The post-February scenario that is unfolding seems to suggest that once 
again, the establishment has deluded itself into believing that it can 
control the flow and tempo of events. The game plan appears to allow the 
PML(N) a plurality, forcing it to form a weak coalition government; the PPP 
will be fragmented, and Ghinvas faction is expected to block the prospects 
of a PPP government in Sindh. Such an outcome would permit the caretakers 
to impose their agenda and ordinances on their successors through an 
assertive president, an aroused judiciary and a benignly neutral GHQ.
    
But there is many a slip between the proverbial cup and the lip. If past 
attempts to obtain positive results are an indicator, elections have a 
momentum and dynamic of their own. For instance, Ghulam Ishaq Khan was as 
shocked as anybody else by the PML(N) landslide in 1990. Bhutto was 
positively embarrassed by the result of the 1977 election. So if the 
February elections are free and fair, the caretakers should not take 
anything for granted. And if Nawaz Sharif is elected with a solid majority, 
he is not going to be the establishments creature. He has many scores to 
settle, but he is not likely to show his hand now.
    
Although there are strident demands from many politicians and journalists 
for both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif to be disqualified from the 
February polls, it does not seem that the caretakers have the stomach for 
such an extreme step. They are well aware that without Pakistans two 
political heavyweights in the ring, the electoral prize-fight will have 
very little credibility within the country or abroad.
    
To compound the current uncertainties is the very real prospect of the 
National Assembly being restored by the Supreme Court. What then? The 
constitutional and political fallout of such a development is too mind-
boggling to contemplate. And yet many experts are of the view that the 
dissolution of the assembly on the stated grounds was improper and not 
covered by the relevant articles of the Constitution. Unpalatable though it 
may be, corruption and inefficiency on the scale we have recently witnessed 
do not provide an excuse to dismiss the government.
    
It seems that we are once again dancing the Pakistani version of the tango: 
one step forward and two steps back.

<a name="poor">Poor water resources to cause food scarcity</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 7: Pakistan may have to resort to food shedding, in 
addition to electricity load-shedding, by the year 2010 unless timely 
action is taken to conserve its water resources, former WAPDA Chairman 
Engineer Shamsul Mulk has warned.

Delivering a lecture at the Centre for Nuclear Studies here on Saturday, 
he attributed the threat of serious food shortages in the foreseeable 
future to the twin menace of population explosion and pollution which 
had reduced the per capita availability of fresh water in Pakistan from 
5000 cubic meters in 1951 to 1200 cubic meters in 1996.

If the present trend of uncontrolled population growth continues, Mr 
Mulk apprehended, the availability of fresh water would further drop to 
700 cubic meters by 2020, making Pakistan a water-scarce instead of a 
country with adequacy of water resources.

In this context, Mr Mulk noted that the Indus River Basin had the fifth 
largest catchment area and that Pakistan had the largest contiguous 
irrigation system in the world. With the worlds largest glaciers 
feeding it, the Indus and its tributaries serve as Pakistans 
hydroelectric and food machines.

The pressure on fresh water resources had already reduced our food 
production drastically. He quoted from a Ford Foundation study of 1970s, 
which stated that out of all the river basins of South Asia, the Indus 
Basin alone had the capacity to triple its grain production in 15 years.

Mr Mulk, however, deplored that because of inaction in the field of 
water resource development since the commissioning of Tarbela reservoir, 
Pakistan had imported two million tons of grains in 1990. He expected 
this figure to grow to 6 million tons in 2000 and to 12 million tons by 
2010. This was because the water resource development, which until early 
70s had kept pace with the population growth, was abandoned, he 
regretted. 

The silting of Mangla and Tarbela since then had further reduced their 
water storage capacities. Thus the per capita availability of water and 
consequently our food production had been declining gradually since 
then.

Recalling that the availability of irrigation water had more than 
doubled after the storage of flood waters in Mangla and Tarbela 
reservoirs, the former WAPDA chief strongly advocated the development of 
all available water storage sites such as that at Kalabagh.

<a name="elec">Electoral reforms: some suggestions</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Safdar A. Butt

THE constitution of a country is the main political systems manual. 
All political activity in the country is regulated by its provisions. But as 
things stand, there is an immediate need to improve certain aspects of our 
constitution to ensure that politicians are not allowed to do as they 
please.
    
Four assemblies have been dissolved over the last eight years. Each time, 
the list of accusations levelled at the disgraced government has included 
corruption, incompetence and irresponsibility. Each successive election has 
produced a weaker parliament than before. The last parliament was in fact 
so divided that it was virtually ruled by the minority groups. Independents 
and leaders of smaller parties were enjoying weightage (and indeed 
privileges) far in excess of their true worth in the eyes of the 
electorate. The ruling party (and of course the country) had to pay the 
price in the shape of huge cabinets, undue favours to parliamentarians, and 
compromises on almost everything. All this made good governance very 
difficult, if not impossible. The inevitable consequence: dismissal of the 
government and dissolution of the assembly.
    
While one cannot forgive the politicians for taking an undue advantage of 
the system, I believe the real cure lies in correcting the system 
before we start trying individuals for their respective sins.
    
Rampant lota-ism is the main problem facing the country. The manner in 
which some of the elected representatives have recently conducted 
themselves has brought shame on the whole nation. An ordinance putting 
restrictions on floor crossing was issued by the acting president before 
the Benazir government took over. However, PDF leaders conveniently allowed 
this presidential ordinance to lapse in order to enable them to buy 
adequate representatives to topple a provincial government and to ensure 
their own continued stay at the centre.
    
What we need is a change in the constitution that ensures automatic 
termination of membership of a legislator if he crosses floor. If an 
elected member of parliament strongly feels about a particular issue, he 
should resign from his seat and seek re-election on the ticket of the party 
that he now wishes to align with.
    
Currently, the constitution allows a person to contest election from 
anywhere and from any number of constituencies. We have seen gross abuse of 
this provision when a person contesting election from a score of seats wins 
just one and goes on to become a power broker. It is proposed that a 
candidate should be allowed to contest election only from the constituency 
where he or she is registered as a voter for at least one year prior to the 
date of the election. This will achieve two objectives; true local 
representation that is the essence of a good democratic system and 
commitment of leaders to their respective constituents.
    
All candidates of a party that secures less than, say, 20% of total votes 
cast at the appropriate level of election should automatically stand 
disqualified whether they win or lose the election as individuals. Each 
independent should be considered a separate party. This provision will 
ensure that only two or three major parties will reach the parliament while 
smaller parties will either die out or merge into larger parties. This will 
bring political stability that is so necessary for the promotion of 
democratic norms.
    
The present constitution has conferred great powers on the president. This 
office acts as a watchdog on the performance of the government. In order to 
make the office of the president closer to the people and to avoid the type 
of accusations the PPP has levelled against a person of their own 
nomination, it is proposed that the president should be elected on direct 
vote basis. However, to give greater weightage to elected representatives, 
rules should be made to the effect that while ordinary voters will have one 
vote each in the presidential election, each local body member shall have, 
say, 100 votes, each MPA shall have, say, 500 votes and each MNA shall 
have, say, 1500 votes. This proposal is a simplified variation of the 
American presidential election system and I believe is more suited to our 
conditions.
    
One of the major faults of our system is that elections are supposed to be 
held every five years. So upon winning an election, parties simply forget 
that they have to go back to the electorate and start indulging in the type 
of activities that culminate in dissolution of assemblies. While formal 
channels of accountability have their utility, I believe the strongest tool 
of accountability available in a democratic set-up is the ballot box. There 
is a need to send political parties to the electorate more frequently than 
once in five years.
    
The idea is to spread the elections. The tenure of the president, national 
assembly, provincial assemblies and local authorities should be set at four 
years. However, the election of each of these offices should be staggered 
in such a way that there is an election held every year. It is proposed 
that March 23 (or such other nationally important date) be set as election 
day each year.
    
In the present situation when national and provincial assemblies as well as 
local bodies stand dissolved, I propose that elections be held in February 
1997 as follows:
    
* national assembly for a tenure of four years, so that the next national 
assembly election takes place in 2001.
    
* provincial assemblies for a tenure of three years, so that the next 
provincial assemblies election takes place in 2000. The provincial 
assemblies to be elected in 2000 will of course have a four-year tenure, 
expiring in 2004.
    
* local bodies election for a tenure of two years so that the next local 
bodies election takes place in 1999. The local bodies to be elected in 1999 
will have a four-year tenure, expiring in 2003.
    
* No presidential election should take place in Feb. 1997, but it should be 
held in 1998 on the semi-direct election basis outlined above for a four-
year term. The next presidential election will therefore be in 2002.
    
Currently, there are no reserved seats for women. Given the nature of our 
countrys population and its attitude towards women, it is necessary that 
at least 20% of our legislators be women. I propose that either through 
drawing lots or by use of statistical methods a schedule be prepared on the 
following lines:
    
* 20% of the seats are reserved for female candidates. No male candidate is 
allowed to contest election on these reserved seats. These seats should 
spread right across the country or province as the case may be.
    
* At the following elections, another set of 20% of seats is reserved for 
female candidates. This should be repeated till such time that each 
constituency has had a woman representative elected.
    
Women should be allowed to contest election on the seats not reserved for 
women but men should not be allowed to contest elections on seats reserved 
for women. Again, should a need for bye-election arise, only women should 
be allowed to contest bye- elections on the reserved seats. In this way, at 
any given time at least 20% of legislators will be women and at the same 
time, each constituency will send a woman member to the assembly for at 
least four out of every twenty years. This proposal is an improvement on 
nomination method used previously as nomination to an elected assembly 
is against the basic concept of democracy. This is also better than electing 
women MNAs on a nationwide election basis as proposed by Mian Nawaz Sharif 
as few women would be able to sustain that magnitude of expenditure or 
stress

<a name="paki">Pakistan win 2nd one-dayer, series against N. Zealand</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

SIALKOT, Dec. 6: An excellent performance by Pakistans opener Saeed Anwar 
(91) and Zahoor Elahi (86), and Ejaz Ahmad (59) and later good effort by 
Pakistani bowlers, spearheaded by Wasim Akram, enabled the home team to 
register a convincing 46-run win over the New Zealand side in the second 
one-day international at the Jinnah Stadium.
    
Pakistan had won the first match by a narrow margin of 11 runs at Municipal 
Stadium Gujranwala on Wednesday and with this win, the hosts also clinched 
the three-match series of limited overs 2-0. The third match to be played 
at the National Stadium, Karachi. However, a win in that match can be 
morale-boosting, since the visitors had started their tour of Pakistan by 
winning the first Test at the Qadhafi Stadium in Lahore but the host, 
bounced back into the series by not also levelling the two Test series 
after a win at Rawalpindi but also registering these two consecutive 
successes thereafter.
    
Captain Wasim Akram won the toss and elected to bat first. His decision 
proved right. But important is the fact that the Pakistani top three 
batsmen made up for their earlier failures by batting well. Once Pakistan 
reached a good score of 277 for 9 in 47 overs, New Zealand had little 
chances of winning.
    
The match began 26 minutes late and was reduced to 47-over a side game. 
Stephen Fleming (88) and Adam Parore (37) caused a little anxiety in the 
Pakistani camp by putting on 118 runs for the third wicket partnership. 
Once that stand was broken the New Zealand side could never recover. 
Fleming hit a superb knock of 88 and like Ejaz Ahmad was the eighth batsman 
out at the total of 213. Saqlain also clean bowled Cairns on not ball after 
being hit for a huge six over the players pavilion.
    
Wasim Akram claimed three New Zealand wickets and Waqar Younis created 
early dents by claiming Bryan Young (5), Mushtaq Ahmad and Shahid Afridi 
also bowled well to claim two wickets each. The Kiwis were all out for 231 
in 42.1 overs.
    
Saeed Anwar was declared Wills Man-of-Match in a split decision of jury of 
five experts. Zahoor Elahi of Pakistan and Chris Harris of New Zealand also 
had claims to the honour.
    
At the total of 177, Zahoor Elahi was bowled by Chris Cairns. While forcing 
the run-rate, he missed the line of Cairns straight delivery and lost bail 
of his off-stump. But before that he had laid a solid foundation of the 
Pakistani innings and totally blunted the New Zealand attack. Zahoor 
Elahis and Saeed Anwars partnership eclipsed the earlier highest 
record of 152 between Shoaib Mohammad and Ramiz Raja against New Zealand at 
Wellington in 1988-89. For the third wicket partnership both had added 
highest number of runs (152) for any wicket against that country.
    
Zahoor Elahi, failing in his first two one-day international matches, found 
his touch finally and hit five sixes during his knock of 86 which also 
included seven scorching boundaries. Zahoors first six was a freakish 
square-out over point boundary as he failed to control his shot off the 
delivery of Chris Cairns. Zahoor hit Cairns over long off boundary to take 
Pakistans total past 50. Then he drove Justin Vaughan straight over his 
head for his third six which also took Pakistans total to 102.

Zahoor Elahi took his individual score to 86, by hitting Nathan Astle over 
mid-wicket fence for his fifth six before falling to Cairns. Zahoor 
exhibited his cuts, pulls and drives, which had the stamp of a matured 
batsman. This knock has enhanced Zahoor Elahis chances of inclusion in the 
Pakistan team for the tour of Australia. In the opinion of some experts the 
bouncy pitches suit this type of batting, if given a chance to prove his 
capabilities.
    
Saeed Anwars knock was a mixture of defence and aggression. He hit 11 
exquisitely-timed boundaries in his top-score of 91 for Pakistan. Saeed 
Anwar neatly drove, cut and pulled the ball. In fact, in his usual style, 
he sent the ball to the ropes to all parts of the ground using his wrists. 
At the total of 225, Saeed Anwar was run out on a direct throw by Harris. 
On both the occasions in the one-day series against New Zealand, Saeed has 
been run out, Saeed Anwar completed his 17th half-century in style and also 
improved Sachin Tendulkars record of the highest number of runs (1497) in 
a calendar year in one-day international matches, by accumulating 1576 runs 
after this knock of 91.
 
In walked Ejaz Ahmad amongst thunderous applause from the spectators and 
hit a brisk knock of 59, studded with two big sixes and four boundaries, to 
further bolster the Pakistani score. He swept Nathan Astle over square-leg 
boundary for his first six and later one-drove Simon Doull for his second 
six. While on one end, Ejaz Ahmad kept exhibiting his flurry of strokes, 
the wickets kept tumbling on the other end. Ejaz was the eighth Pakistani 
out, caught at long-on boundary off Justin Vaughan at the total of 269. 
Ejaz hit 59 runs in only 71 minutes, consuming 57 deliveries.

<a name="defe">Pakistan defeat Australia 4-2 in Champions Trophy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sydney Friskin

MADRAS, Dec. 8: Pakistan bounced back into contention on the second day of 
the 18th Champions Trophy hockey tournament with a convincing 4-2 victory 
over Australia.
    
>From the start Pakistan took the match by the scruff of the neck and never 
let go, leaving the Australians wondering what had hit them.
    
Rahim Khan, who impressed on the previous day in the 2-0 defeat by Holland, 
put Pakistan ahead in the 21st minute with a brilliant goal well struck 
into the corner of the net. The lead was consolidated five minutes later by 
centre forward Kamran Ashraf after a fine bout of passing with Mohammad 
Anis and Babar Abdullah. 

Australia who had been knocked off their feet recovered some of their 
composure when the wing half Baoden Choppy rounded off a combined movement 
with a well-taken goal in the 30th minute.
    
Maintaining the pace with which they had started, Pakistan went in search 
of more goals immediately after the resumption of play and Mohammed Usman 
scored off the rebound for a 3-1 lead.
    
The match was briefly flickered into a contest when Jeremy Hiskins, a 
substitute, scored for Australia. This goal spurred the Australians on to 
greater endeavour but towards the end a goal by Ali Raza from a penalty 
corner put the issue beyond doubt.
    
Pakistans next match is against Spain on Tuesday. It might be recalled 
that in the Olympic Games at Atlanta Spain destroyed all chances of a medal 
for Pakistan by defeating them 3-0.

<a name="bowl">Bowlers have tough task ahead, says Akram</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 8: Pakistan captain Wasim Akram said the bowlers had a tough 
task ahead in Australia as the conditions there were more conducive to 
stroke-makers than bowlers.
    
He said he was going to Australia with a positive approach and thinking to 
win the tournament. The West Indies and the Australians, will be aiming at 
the same glory but I think we have an edge as we have been playing together 
for quite sometime now. Secondly the West Indies are playing below par and 
the Australians are not getting the practice they would have loved to 
before entering the tournament.
    
I think if we have a real chance to win the WSC for the first time, it is 
this time. But one-day cricket is very funny and anything can happen.
    
Akram said he was happy with the selected outfit. I am glad specially for 
Aamir Sohail who got back into form in the Patrons Trophy. He is a very 
gutsy and utility cricketer and I am looking forward for him to shoulder 
most of the responsibilities with bat and ball.
    
Salim Maliks absence will be certainly felt but we have Ijaz Ahmad and 
Saeed Anwar who are in sparkling form and then Inzamamul Haq must be hungry 
for runs. I am also in form while Moin Khan can also score valuable runs. I 
need not mention Shahid Afridi who has scored the quickest century in one-
day cricket. In this background, I feel that we will be much at ease 
batting second, said the left-hander.

<a name="mali">Malik withdraws from trip, back problem for Inzamam</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 9: Pakistans senior-most current batsman, Salim Malik, 
pulled out from the tour of Australia to take part in the World Series Cup.
    
No official announcement has so far come from the Pakistan Cricket Board, 
but it is learnt from well-placed sources that the former skipper has been 
advised two weeks rest. As the situation stands at the moment, the 
selectors have decided to stick to the remaining 14 players and three 
officials.
    
Besides Salim Maliks injury, Inzamamul Haq is also carrying a bad back 
while paceman Mohammad Zahid has made complaints of pain around the inter-
coastal muscle little down the left rib cage.
    
Inzamamul Haq was to undergo MIR tests for his back at Ziauddin Hospital as 
the team manager wanted to be absolutely sure about the fitness of the 
player. However, Inzamam disappeared and was known later in the day to be 
heading for his home in Multan. When efforts were made to locate him there, 
no one responded said Mushtaq Mohammad.
    
Cricket manager, Mushtaq Mohammad, when contacted said he was unaware of 
the latest development. As far as I am concerned, Salim Malik is going 
with the team as no official of the PCB has till this time informed me of 
Maliks inability to proceed with the side because of injury.
    
Mushtaq admitted that he had tried to contact the batsman on Sunday but all 
his efforts went in vain as Malik didnt make a return call. I had left
 a message when told that he was not at home. But until now, I am waiting for 
his call.
    
Desperate attempts to locate Salim Malik were also made from the PCB 
Karachi office but this time no one responded from Maliks home. 
Nevertheless, it was later confirmed from Maliks in-laws that he was in 
Lahore. Maliks ankle has been tapped and he has been advised bed rest 
for another eight days before the specialists take another look at the wound,
 family sources in Lahore said.
    
Pakistan captain Wasim Akram also said he has not been informed about Salim 
Malik `directly. I have come to know about Malik from other people. 
As far as Inzamamul Haq is concerned, he also has a bad back but I am 
optimistic that he will be able to overcome the problem.
