STOCKHOLM, May 9: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in an interview with 
Swedish TV-4 news channel, directly held India responsible for the latest 
bombings and other chronic political violence in Pakistan saying. It is to 
turn the world attention from the ongoing farce that is called democratic 
elections in Kashmir.
    
Thereby she changed the intensity of her charges giving rise to speculation 
that she had received some definite information from home during the day.
    
In the morning, meeting with a Press-pool at the Haga Castle, Ms Bhutto, 
had refrained from naming India, and had not connected it with the recent 
bombings.
    
We have problems in Karachi, she had told a questioner, and they are 
stirred up by a neighbour.
    
Ms Bhutto said: The tensions between India and Pakistan are a reality, 
even though there exists no immediate threat of a war. But as a mother I 
hate the thought that my children should grow up in the shadow of nuclear 
weapons.
    
Responding to the question that neither India nor Pakistan had, as yet, 
ratified the Nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, Ms Bhutto said peaceably: 
No, unfortunately that is no. However, I have hopes that with Swedish 
assistance we will achieve a nuclear-free zone in South Asia.
    
She also held India responsible both for the cold war between the two 
countries and risks for nuclear-weapons war in the region.
    
This threat greatly increases if the Hindu nationalist party, the BJP, 
wins the just finished parliamentary elections. According to an electoral 
manifesto, the BJP said that it would test a nuclear device. It is like 
receiving a cold shower whenever one seeks to believe in the promises that 
India gives.
    
Ms Bhutto also showed her understanding of the problems faced by India and 
Indian Polity: India finds itself in an enormous stage of transition. From 
a state-controlled economy towards a new liberalising. That is bound to be 
a difficult period for the Indians.
    
But she also, pragmatically, accepted that India is not responsible for all 
Pakistani woes and enumerates the domestic problems: First comes economy, 
with inflation and budget deficiency. Then the low development of human 
resources, with just 27% of Pakistans population being able to read. To 
remedy this situation, she proudly announces an ambitious plan to provide 
10,000 schools every year.
    
The third problem is said Ms Bhutto, the population explosion. Pakistan 
has 133 million people compared to 500 million in Europe and 700 million in 
India. She quickly accepted when corrected that Indias crosses 900 
million.
    
On democracy in Pakistan, the Prime Minister said: The armed forces have, 
now, come to realise that only a democratic Pakistan can command respect 
around the world. However, the Pakistani democracy continues to be 
perilously threatened by elements among the bureaucrats and the military as 
well as the religious parties, which enjoy neither support nor following 
among the people.

<a name="paki">Pakistan also armed Bosnia, claims WP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, May 12: Pakistan has been named as one of the several allies of 
the United States which supplied arms to Bosnia in addition to Iran, at a 
time when an arms embargo was in force.
    
The Washington Post said in a front-page report on Sunday that Pakistan, 
Brunei, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Hungary and Argentina were the 
other countries which violated the embargo with a wink from the Clinton 
administration.
    
The issue is now under intense investigation by Congress and is set to 
become a hot election issue as the probe is to continue until November when 
the presidential elections take place.

US officials learned in 1992 than Iran had opened a smuggling route to 
Bosnia with the assistance of Turkey, two years before a controversial 
decision by President Clinton to give Croatia a diplomatic green light for 
the shipments, national security adviser Anthony Lake said on Friday.
    
Bosnian government officials said that by 1993, arms or money for arms 
purchases also were being supplied through the Turkish pipeline by Saudi 
Arabia, Malaysia, Brunei and Pakistan, and that other weapons shipments 
came from Hungary and Argentina.
    
US officials knew of most of the arms shipments but took no action, 
despite Clintons public support for a United Nations-sponsored arms 
embargo against Bosnia, Croatia, and the other nations of the former 
Yugoslavia. That policy marked a break with the Bush administration, which 
strongly protested when an Iranian plane flew into Zagreb in September, 
1992 with 4,000 assault weapons, prompting Croatia to impound the cargo.

<a name="trag">Tragedy near Khairpur 45 feared dead as bus falls into canal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim Shamsi

SUKKUR, May 13: At least 45 passengers of a bus, including women and 
children, are feared to have drowned in Rohri Canal, near Therhi in 
Khairpur district, after the vehicle, on way from Khairpur to Sukkur, 
plunged into the canal.
    
The accident took place after the tie-rod of the bus broke and the driver 
of the ill-fated bus, Gul Shah, lost control over the steering. The bus 
after colliding against the railing of the bridge fell into the canal.
     
The ADM of Khairpur told Dawn on telephone that the bus had been taken out 
of the canal, and water had been blocked near Tando Musti to retrieve the 
bodies of the victims. He said the irrigation department had closed the 
canal gates within an hour of the accident and the water level was 
gradually falling.
    
Personnel of the rescuing party told this correspondent at the site of the 
incident that the bus driver, Gul Shah, and cleaner Sanaullah Phulpoto, 
after learning that the tie-rod had broken jumped out of the moving bus. 
Both of them were not traceable.
    
The extent of the tragedy, which is believed to have been the biggest in 
the area, could have been much less if adequate rescue and relief measures 
were taken promptly, local people said.
    
Eye witnesses told this correspondent that the bus was over-loaded and some 
passengers were also travelling on the roof of the bus when the tragedy 
occurred.
    
Soon after the accident officials of district administration assisted by 
police and rangers rushed to the site of the accident and attempts began 
for the rescue of survivors and recover bodies of the dead. Villagers and 
irrigation staff also joined rescue operation which started at about 4 pm, 
an hour after the incident.    
    
This correspondent saw only a couple of boats and a few divers taking part 
in the rescue operation. The crane which was brought to the site to salvage 
the bus could not be mobilised for more than one hour after the accident.
    
Meanwhile, hundreds of people from the adjoining villages, including the 
relatives of the bus victims, were sitting helpless on the canal bank and 
the atmosphere was extremely gloomy.
    
It was learnt that majority of the passengers belonged to Therhi, Baberloi, 
Karamabad, Khairpur and Sukkur.
    
Although 12 bodies had already been recovered, the Khairpur ADM said 
identification process would take some time as the entire machinery was 
engaged in rescue.

<a name="kala">Kalabagh dam controversy emerges anew</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
R.M.U. Suleman

In recent weeks, Kalabagh dam polemics have emerged in a manner that marks 
the fresh launching of a vital project. Federal Minister Khar and the 
Punjab Chief Minister Nakai have described the project as a matter of life 
and death and President Leghari has forcefully backed it, but emphasised 
the dams energy role.
    
These assertions have not gone uncontested from the smaller provinces. 
Chief Minister Sherpao has called it damaging to the NWFP and dubbed it a 
dead horse due to the investment focus of the World Bank having shifted 
decisively from big projects and big dams to drainage and other small 
projects. Mumtaz Bhutto, the Sindhi nationalist, has just claimed that the 
dam will start the inexorable process of turning his province into a 
desert. Balochistan is also not happy.
    
Prime Minister Bhutto has remained completely silent on the issue for there 
is no rational economic issue more as a balance between sanity and madness. 
No economic issue has portrayed Pakistan more as a fragile republic, 
questioned and attacked from different sides since its very inception.
    
Kalabagh dam has already brought to the fore an upstream - downstream 
conflict of almost international dimensions. The issues highlighted are 
displacement, sedimentation, seismic safety and general environmental 
hazards.

Financing

The central point of the whole debate is financing. If the project is to 
take off, it needs very strong support from IMF, the World Bank and other 
international donors. These donors are all opposed to the project seemingly 
on environmental grounds, but really by the new theology of privatisation 
and unbridled private sector development.
    
IMFs Changed stance

The IMF has developed a new philosophy against big dams based on 
displacement of people, water-logging and damage to the environment. On the 
contrary, said President Leghari, the World Bank was itself supporting 
electricity generation through thermal and coal-fired plants and has set up 
a fund for this purposed. But thermal power is far less environment-
friendly. President said Pakistan has untapped hydel resources and can 
produce 30,000 MW of hydel power against its present electricity generation 
of a little more than 6,000 MW but no one is helping us to tap 30,000 MW 
power potential on Indus.
    
You cannot adopt this environment religion of World Bank preaching. Every 
country has its own priorities. The President said adding that the 
electricity consumption gap between the rich and the poor countries was 
constantly widening.

Threatened habitats

With the present level of marginalisation of the local people, whose 
habitats are threatened by submersion, adequate and satisfactory 
compensation and rehabilitation may continue to be elusine. There is no 
doubt that in an era characterised by growth of free market and 
privatisation official policy for land acquisition should not be driven by 
colonial instruments like the Land Acquisition Act. Instead market value 
and individual agreements should be the basis for such process. Such a 
step, however, is sure to push up the cost part of the project.
    
The opposition to Kalabagh dam from the lower riparian Sindh is the most 
bitter. It is widely believed there that if the dam is built the forests in 
the province, including the mangroves, will be destroyed and the Kacha and 
Delta lands would become barren. According to Dr. Shag, the famous 
Hyderabad hydraulics expert, it was not correct that Southern Punjab was 
getting dry dur to Pack of water and Sindh was floating on a lake due to 
excess of water.
    
Fresh Indus water flowing into the Arabian Sea is no wastage, adds Dr. 
Sohag. It is considered essential for the growth of mangroves, maintenance 
of riverine forests, replenishment of ground water reserves and control of 
sea water intrusion into the domains of fresh water.
    
Dr. Yaqoob Bhatti, another hydraulics expert has countered all the 
objections raised by Dr. Sohag. Anxiety that Sindh will turn into a desert 
is countered by asserting that dams do not consume any water. Instead, they 
store water during flood seasons and then supply it to support irrigation 
during the dry Rabi period. Due to Tarbela dam, diversion to Sindh, he 
asserted, had increased from 10.7 to 15.2 maf.
    
Sailaba area in Sindh, Dr. Bhatti added., was a mere 66,000 acres and its 
water supplies will not be locked. He discounted all possibility of sea 
water intrusion. Mangrove forests, according to him, cover an area of 
320,000 acres and 95 per cent of the tree population there consisted of 
salt-tolerant varieties. The real threat to mangroves were seen as arising 
from over-grazing and tree cutting due to extreme population pressure.

A decade of discussions by politicians and engineers have failed to produce 
consensus on Kalabagh dam. The issue should now be thrown open for the 
people to discuss and decide.

<a name="tehr">Tehrik will end all VIP perks if comes to power</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 13: Former cricket hero Imran Khan said on Monday that his 
newly-formed Tehrik-i-Insaf (Movement for Justice) after organising itself 
into a political party would purge the countrys political system after 
sweeping national elections in 1998. It would also end perks to politicians 
like foreign medical treatment and abolish VIP lounges at the countrys 
airports, he said.
    
Mr Khan criticised Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos recent CNN interview and 
said the situation in the country was completely different from what she 
was telling the international media.
    
Anyone in the country can see there is corruption everywhere and yet the 
Prime Minister tells CNN there is no corruption. Nobody is fooled by these 
stories, he said.
    
 I know its [politics] a really difficult task. I expect that the young 
people of the country will be in the forefront of this movement because 
they feel helpless and frustrated at what they see being done to the 
countrys resources by the ruling elite, he said.
    
 I dont understand why the government spends so much money on expensive 
Mercedes and huge state-owned palaces when the countrys social indicators 
are ranked among the lowest by the UN. The small ruling class which your 
tax money puts up never sends its children to government schools, never 
goes to a government hospital for treatment. Only if they waited in long 
lines like everybody else at government offices would they realise how bad 
it is for ordinary citizens, he said.
    
Mr Khan said a team was at work on a comprehensive party constitution, and 
manifesto was already under way. He declined to give any specific names of 
people who might have already become involved in the Tehrik.
    
These are names most people wouldnt know of because they are part of the 
silent majority. But let me tell you, they are people who can deliver.
    
Mr Khan said overseas Pakistanis  several of whom he had met during the 
Shaukat Khanum hospitals fund-raising  were another group which wanted to 
use its immense talent and economic clout to invest in the country but 
had always been discouraged by the corruption they faced here.

<a name="ussp">US speaks of Chinas assurance to end supplies</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, May 11: China has promised to stop all nuclear co-operation 
with Pakistan including shipments for the Kahuta and Khushab facilities, US 
officials claimed on Saturday after Fridays announcement that no sanctions 
would be imposed against China or Pakistan on the ring magnets issue.
    
These unidentified officials were extensively quoted by the US media as the 
administrations decision evoked a mixed response on the Capitol Hill, with 
President Clinton saying he was delighted and his rival Bob Dole accusing 
the administration of being too slow.
    
To many observers, however, the decision not to impose sanctions did not 
come as a surprise as the administration had dropped broad hints in the 
past few weeks that evidence collected by the US was not enough to take 
such a major political step that would have created more problems for the 
US businesses than the Chinese.
    
US officials tried to present the Chinese statement issued as result of the 
negotiations as a major success but Pakistani sources said the statement 
contained nothing that could be of any concern to Islamabad as China is a 
trusted and reliable friend, proved to be so over decades.
    
Washington Post quoted officials as saying that Beijings new pledge meant 
that Chinese companies would not supply more such magnets to Pakistan and 
China would have to halt other assistance to the Kahuta facility, as well 
as to a separate Pakistani reactor being constructed at Khushab.
    
China further agreed to hold consultations with the United States on 
policies for controlling exports of nuclear-related equipment so that 
questionable nuclear equipment is not shipped to foreign purchasers.
    
These commitments were precisely what we would have sought as a basis to 
remove sanctions had it been necessary to impose sanctions, State 
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
    
One US official predicted Chinas new pledge to suspend assistance would 
cause a lot of dismay and unhappiness in Islamabad, which had counted on 
buying more magnets from China. But he conceded Pakistan probably could 
build the magnets itself.
    
But Pakistan sources dismissed the observations saying China had not 
promised anything in its public statement which it had not been saying 
before.

<a name="earl">Early start of transit trade stressed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ASHKABAD, May 14: The heads of the ECO member states called upon the member 
countries to focus attention on transport and communication, trade and 
energy sectors to accelerate the process of regional economic co-operation 
and to make them meaningful.
    
The summit urges the member governments to ensure their participation and 
speedy implementation of projects in priority areas envisaged in the ECOs 
plans of action by including them in their respective national plans or 
through bilateral and regional arrangements, a communique issued at the 
end of the ECO summit said.
    
The two-day summit, attended by 10 member countries, was reduced to one day 
after the heads of the member states passed the recommendations of the 
Eminent Persons Group adopted by the council of ministers at its meeting 
held on May 11. The next meeting of the council will be held in Izmir in 
autumn 1996 to sign the Treaty of Izmir.

The communique called for the early establishment of ECO institutions on 
the basis of agreements signed during the third ECO summit and expeditious 
implementation of the ECO transit trade agreement by finalising transit 
regulations including mutually-agreed customs procedures within the region 
in accordance with the international conventions as well as multilateral 
transit agreements signed by the member states.

The plan envisages access to adequate seaport facilities for landlocked 
countries of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, 
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan through Iran, Pakistan and Turkey, with 
priority to transit roads connecting Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and 
Uzbekistan with the port city of Karachi and Gwadar through Afghanistan.
    
The heads of states noted with satisfaction the proposed gas and oil 
pipeline network in the region with priority to the construction of a gas 
pipeline from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey, and Iran to 
Pakistan. They observed that other member countries could also use these 
pipelines for their exports.
    
The communique recommended that keeping in view the ECOs existing 
preferential tariffs arrangement, the possibility of progressive removal of 
trade barriers within the ECO region should also be considered. However, 
for this purpose the experiences of other regions, global economic trends 
and international commitments should also be taken into account.

<a name="10ub">10 UBL officials including MNA arrested</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, MAY 14: In a first major move after the State Bank took over 
management control of the sinking United Bank some three weeks ago, the 
Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) arrested ten officials and staff 
members, including the union chief and the ruling party MNA from Karachi  
Abdul Aziz Memon.
    
We are going to arrest about a dozen more who include senior executives 
within next 24 hours, the director-general of the FIA Rahman Malik told 
newsmen at a Press conference while indicating a countrywide sweep.
    
Called hurriedly, on hardly four hours notice after morning newspapers 
published reports of rangers deployment at the UBL head office including 
the UBL Presidents office and many branches in the city late on Monday 
night the Press conference was addressed by the State Bank Governor Dr 
Mohammad Yaqub, who anticipating counter moves from the UBL Labour Union, 
warned that any miscreant will be picked up and dealt accordingly. 
   
Rehman Malik initially refused to divulge the name of persons arrested as 
he explained We are making a countrywide sweep and would release names of 
all arrested persons tomorrow, but later on insistence of the journalists 
confirmed the arrest of Abdul Aziz Memon.
   
He said Memon has been charged under 409 and 419 PPC and section 16 and 17 
of PPO 1969. Arrest has been made on complaint of UBL President under FIR 
No 5/96. Memon has been accused of misappropriation of Rs 100 million and 
would need surety bond of Rs 200 million if he moves to the court to obtain 
release.
    
This is just the first FIR and as the ongoing investigation reveals more 
information, further FIRs will be lodged, a senior official of the FIA, 
who assisted Rahman Malik, said.
    
Earlier, the State Bank Governor, Dr Mohammad Yaqub charge-sheeted Aziz 
Memon and his accomplices in the UBL for taking over control of 180 to 190 
vehicles of the bank whose bills for petrol consumption and over-time 
payment of drivers were being collected at gun point, and employing ghost 
workers.
    
Accusing them of extortion he charged them of causing a loss of Rs 680 
million to Rs 690 million every year to the UBL.

<a name="psdp">PSDP may not get any increase in budget</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 12: The authors of the new budget have expressed inability 
to give even a five per cent increase in the Public Sector Development 
Programme (PSDP) for 1996-97 and have recommended only the last year level 
of Rs96.5 billion because of the acute funding position of the federal 
government.
    
The officials maintained that if at all the conditionalities of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) were to be met, then it was simply 
difficult to offer any increase in the PSDP. They said that since the 
government had been forced to achieve 4 per cent budget deficit of the GDP 
and bank borrowing ceiling of Rs39 billion (both from the State Bank and 
other banking sources) for the next fiscal, it was almost impossible to 
enhance the size of the next PSDP.
    
Now it all depends on the prime minister and she too is not likely to 
concede much and may allow maximum Rs3 to 4 billion increase in the 
proposed PSDP, said a senior official. He told Dawn that the budget-makers 
were perturbed how to manage resources to fund the next budget, including 
the PSDP.
    
The deputy chairman of planning commission is said to have proposed that 
without allowing at least 10 per cent increase keeping in view the rate of 
inflation and price-hike, it will be difficult to cover most of the 
development schemes. The priority committee of the ministry of finance has

<a name="plun">Plunderers of national wealth will be taken to task</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Intikhab Amir

PESHAWAR, May 10: Imran Khan, chief of the Tehrik-i-Insaaf (Movement for 
Justice), said that after coming to power, the movement would eliminate the 
VIP culture from the country and make accountable the plunderers of the 
national exchequer.
    
Addressing his first public meeting in the NWFP at a village in the 
outskirts of Nowshera, some 50 kilometres from Peshawar, Mr Khan reiterated 
that the movement would be concentrating on its single point agenda of 
ensuring justice for all in the country.
    
He said the rulers had failed to resolve the peoples problems and the 
country needed a new political party with true representatives of the 
people to bring a positive change  a change for justice.
    
Since the inception of Pakistan, the Tehrik-i-Insaaf chief said, no one had 
been made accountable for his or her misdeeds but, after coming to power, 
the movement would make accountable the corrupt and those found guilty of 
plundering the national wealth.
    
Giving his agenda after coming to power, he said merit would strictly be 
followed, especially for the government functionaries and in his 
organisational set-up.
    
He said as change could not be brought about without going to the 
parliament, the movement would contest the next general elections.
    
Terming joblessness as one of the main problems of the country, he said 
youths were not given their due rights and for that matter, he added, the 
prevailing VIP culture would be eliminated from the country where all the 
high cost residential palaces of the elite would be converted into schools 
and colleges so that a healthy and fair society could be established.
    
The Tehrik-i-Insaaf chief said he did not believe in hollow slogans and 
would never make such claims which could not be given practical shape.
    
During his speech, he said the minimum age limit for voters would be 
brought down to 18 years instead of prevailing 21 years, and the change 
would be made according to the Constitution.
    
He said complete programme and manifesto of the movement would be prepared 
within three to five years and the situation would be clearer then.

<a name="feud">Feudalism main obstacle in economic progress</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, May 14: Pakistan has the prospects of a bright economic future 
provided it sheds the shackles of embedded feudalism and reforms its 
colonial infrastructure to conform with the realities of the emerging new 
economic orders.
    
So observed most of the speakers at a seminar on Pakistan: contemporary 
conflicts and realities at the Columbia University on Sunday, organised by 
an organisation of technocrats and professionals called Friends of 
Pakistan.
    
Dr Nadeemul Haque, an economist working for International Monetary Fund 
credited the so-called informal sector in Pakistan for keeping countrys 
economy afloat despite drawbacks of inconsistent and uncertain economic 
policies of successive governments.
    
But, the speaker who drew most applause and standing ovation from a crowd 
of over 300 Pakistanis, cramped in a small auditorium was professor Eqbal 
Ahmed. 
    
Prof Ahmed essentially blamed Pakistans intelligentsia for the 
degeneration and corruption in Pakistan.
    
While saying that he was optimistic about the future of Pakistan because of 
the honesty of its forsaken people, he listed six categories of crisis 
facing the nation  legitimacy, development, distribution (of wealth), 
democracy, integration and culture.
    
Prof Ahmed observed that the ideological ambivalence pervasive in Pakistani 
politics was rooted in its intelligentsias failure to tackle the issue 
head-on.
    
Prof Hasan Askari Rizvi who sits at the Quaid-i-Azam chair, at the South 
Asian Institute at the Columbia University expounded on Military and 
political dilemma in Pakistan.
    
Prof Manzooruddin Ahmed, the former vice-chancellor of Karachi University, 
spoke about the relevance of ideology of Pakistan  then and now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 13: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto directed the concerned 
authorities to avoid massive taxation in the next budget as proposed by 
the ministry of finance and the CBR. She was presiding over a meeting held 
to discuss budgetary measures for 1996-97.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the prime ministers adviser on finance and 
economic affairs told the meeting that without resorting to new taxes it 
would be simply difficult to achieve 4 per cent GDP budget deficit target.
    
Nevertheless, sources said the prime minister called for avoiding burdening 
the masses with heavy taxes. She agreed that the present weak tax base be 
widened by finding out new tax payers specially those who have not been 
paying their taxes despite their good financial position. The prime 
minister, sources said, favoured the introduction of agriculture tax as was 
being demanded by the IMF and the World Bank.
    
She also favoured increasing the present Rs50,000 ceiling of income tax 
exemption for the salaried classes.
    
Sources said Mr Jafarey told the meeting that 4 per cent GDP budget deficit 
target will be achieved during the next fiscal and that tariffs to be 
lowered at 55 per cent along with achieving 8 per cent rate of inflation.
    
The Capital outlay of the budget has initially been fixed at about Rs475 
billion compared to current years level of Rs431 billion. But the final 
decision will be taken at a NEC meeting to be held on May 30.
    
Deputy Chairman Planning Commission Kazi Alimullah briefed the meeting on 
the Public Sector Development Programme(PSDP) of 1996, seeking to allow 
considerable increase over the last year of Rs96.5 billion.

<a name="fore">Foreign trade gap rises to alarmingly high $2.83bn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, May 12: The foreign trade gap of Pakistan rose to an alarmingly 
high $2.83 billion during the period July-April of the current financial 
year, showing an increase of close to one billion US dollars or 53.1% more 
than the corresponding period of 1994-95, according to official statistics.
    
At the end of July-March, 1995-96, it will be recalled, the imports had 
outstripped the exports by $2.690 billion.
    
The incomplete trade figures, obtained by Dawn unofficially, show, however, 
that the gap between exports and imports last month narrowed from $213 
million to $156 million of April, 1995. The exports amounted to $810.3 
million, 10% more than during the corresponding month of last year when 
Pakistan was able to earn $736 million. However, a slight increase of $17 
million in imports is indicated. Last month, imports amounted to $966.7 
million.
    
The fact that the rupee depreciated against the dollar by 12.87% from 
April, 1995 to April, 1996, may mean that the cascading effect of 
devaluation and the slowing down of economy indicated by decline in exports 
of value-added items also contributed to the unprecedented trade gap.
    
This trend is confirmed by a comparison with the statistics in March, 1996. 
In that month, exports declined by 4% over last month, while the imports 
fell from $1.174 billion to $966 million or by more than 17.66 per cent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, May 9: The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and 
Export Credit (ICIIEC) has offered Export Credit Insurance facility on the 
principles of Shariah  on profit and loss basis to the Pakistani 
exporters.
    
The Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit, 
of which Pakistan is also a member, is a subsidiary of Islamic Development

The corporation is initially providing Export Credit Insurance facility to 
the exporters of its member countries but plans to offer investment 
insurance at a suitable juncture in future.
    
While carrying out its operations in accordance with the principles of 
Shariah, the corporation will endeavour to achieve mutual co-operation of 
policy holders through their collective sharing of losses, which any policy

the insurance and reinsurance operations to policy holders after meeting 
statutory reserve obligations.

credit or investment loans, and invest its own funds in accordance the with 
Islamic principles.

Individuals and institutions of member states who could be eligible to 
receive the services of the corporation include banks, any person, who is a

<a name="ecco">ECC okays Rs16.8bn energy projects</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 13: The Economic Co-ordination Committee (ECC) of the 
cabinet, which met with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in the chair, 
approved five projects worth Rs16.8 billion in the energy sector and 
allowed re-export of imported machinery to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and 
Maldives.
    
Commerce Secretary Salman Faruqui said the approval of the projects was 
important, but the decision to allow the re-export of machinery which 
remained in the use for more than five years in Pakistan was equally vital.
    
He told Dawn that the government had accepted the request of exporters by 
allowing them to re-export their machinery. He said this machinery could be 
purchased by many Third World countries, including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka 
and Maldives.
    
We plan to provide unlimited credit line to exporters to import modern 
machinery by disposing of the five-year-old one, he said, adding that 
suppliers credit and bank credit will be available in this behalf.
    
Then we have decided to provide 1,500 acres of land to the industrialists 
of Faisalabad, Gujranwala and other places in Punjab to set up modern 
industrial plants there, he said.

He termed the ECC decision of allowing the re-export of machinery very good 
for both the country and the investors. We are sure that this will help us 
to increase our exports with all the potentials, the commerce secretary 
added.
    
The following projects were approved. The largest project approved by the 
ECC envisaged the construction of a total of 613 kms of 500 KV transmission 
lines and allied grid stations for dispersal of power from Ghazi Brotha 
Hydropower Project. It will be completed by October 1999 at a cost of 
Rs14.1 billion. The second project was the 2nd 220 KV Guddu-Sibbi-Quetta 
Transmission Line which would remove the bottlenecks in power transmission 
to Balochistan. Involving a cost of Rs2,022 million, the project would be 
completed by the end of 1996. The ECC approved another project to upgrade 
and modernise the Gas Turbines Repair Workshop at Faisalabad. Under it, 
repair facilities at the existing workshop, established in 1982, would be 
upgraded to undertake the repair of heavy gas turbines which are presently 
sent abroad, thus saving Rs363 million annually in foreign exchange. The 
project would be completed by April, 1998 at a cost of Rs364 million. The 
ECC approved a project to carry out detailed analysis of energy planning 
and related financial data with a view to enhancing governments 
capabilities to assess future energy requirement and to draw up feasible 
plans to meet them. The project would cost over Rs5 million. The ECC 
approved a project to conduct a pre-feasibility study to construct the 
1,290 MW Bunji Hydropower plant on Indus river. The study, to be carried 
out at a cost of Rs293 million, will be completed by June, 1998.

<a name="loca">Locally assembled automatic car to roll out in October</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aamir Shafaat Khan

KARACHI, May 15: The Ghandara Nissan Ltd (GNL) will roll out Pakistan's 
first locally assembled, 1,400cc, automatic transmission system car, 
'Nissan Sunny' in October.
    
Besides, the company intends to roll out another gasoline version, 1,400cc, 
'Sunny', in the same month, an official of the GNL said. Subsequently, the 
company has scheduled to introduce 2,000cc cars in diesel version after the 
launching of two models, he added.
    
'Preparations to roll out the two versions are already underway at the 
modern plant, located in the Port Bin Qasim area. The cost of the plant is 
Rs 550 mn, having capacity to produce 6,000 cars every year on single shift 
basis,' he said.
    
The official added that the GNL has planned to market the two versions very 
shortly.
    
The two sedans, he said, include additional features like multi link beam 
suspension system coupled with electronic concentrated engine control 
system.
    
Automobile analysts believe that the new Sunny will get a good response as 
its previous imported models from 1985 to 1987 had captured a sizeable 
market share.

<a name="stoc">Stocks recover on strong institutional support</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, May 9: After early steep decline on some nervous selling prompted 
reportedly by an expected results of the Indian elections and partly to 
weekend profit-taking, stocks recovered during the mid-session on strong 
institutional support.
    
An apparent defeat of the Congress or its inability to form a stable 
government could well mean a policy change by the new comer and this fact 
triggered selling. investors here, most analysts believe.

The KSE 100-share index finally ended around 1,768.17 as compared to 
1,761.04 a day earlier, showing a gain of 7.13 points as base shares 
subsequently recovered initial losses.
    
Trading volume failed to pick and was contained below the 20 million shares 
mark as both the current favourites, Hub-Power and PTC vouchers were not 
traded massively as they are still on the spot list.
    
Hub-Power did show signs of lively trading during the session but PTC 
vouchers were neglected and were removed from the most active list for the 
first time after they were listed. Only half a million shares were traded 
in the PTC, that too on the lower side, reflecting that there were more 
sellers than buyers.
    
However, Lucky Cement was traded actively and proved itself one of the most 
active scrips on active short-covering at the lower levels.
    
Plus signs, however, dominated the list under the lead of 2nd and 4th ICPs, 
which rose by Rs 8 to 20 amid active two-way trading.
    
They were followed by 8th and 9th ICP, ICP SEMF, Dewan Salman, Shell 
Pakistan, Attock Refinery, PSO and Rafhan Maize, which rose by Rs 2.75 to 
5.
    
Losses on the other hand were fractional barring sharp setback in PIC and 
Balochistan Glass, which suffered decline ranging from Rs 4.75 to 10.
    
Other prominent losers were led by Adamjee Insurance, Pakland cement, 
Telecard, BOC Pakistan and Century Insurance, falling by one rupee to Rs 
1.5.
    
The Board of Directors of Smith and Kline has announced a maintained 
dividend at the rate of 30 per cent for the last year.
    
The most active list was topped by Lucky Cement, up 50 paisa on 2.979m 
shares, followed by Hub-Power, lower 10 paisa on 2.053m shares, LTV 
Modaraba, easy 15 paisa on 1.519m shares, Fauji Fertiliser, off 50 paisa on 
1.180m shares, D.G.Khan Cement, lower 50 paisa on 0.643m shares, PTC 
vouchers down 60 paisa on 0.500m shares and Dewan Salman, higher Rs 2.75 on 
0.579m shares. There were several other notable deals also.
    
Trading volume fell to 17.269 m shares from the previous 17.773m shares 
owing to the absence of leading sellers.
    
There were 285 actives, out of which 117 shares rose, while 104 fell, with 
64 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="fall">Stocks fall across a broad front on hasty selling</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, May 15: Stocks fell across a broad front on hasty selling prompted 
by news of arrest of some top officials of the United Bank for alleged 
irregularities but there were buyers at the dips.
    
The opening was a bit subdued but there was no nervous selling from any 
quarter as the index was down only about 14 points.
    
However, after mid-session the selling gathered momentum on fears that some 
more bank officials might face an identical action, pushing the index down 
by 38.96 points at 1,735.45 as compared to 1,774.41 a day earlier.
    
For the last about four months, the index is fluctuating between 1,550 and 
1,750, that is within the range of 200 points contrary to predictions of a 
big quantum leap to 2,000 points, he added.
    
But the interesting feature was that there were buyers at the falling 
prices, signalling that the reaction is temporary and the bulls could fight 
back any time.

Bank shares fell across the board in response to news of UBL operation but 
losses were manageable as selling was well-absorbed at the decline. Big 
losers among them included Askari Bank, Bank of Punjab, Faysal Bank and 
MCB, falling by one rupee to Rs 1.75.
    
But bulk of the selling was centred around most of the current favourites, 
notably Dewan Salman, Dhan Fibre, PTC Vouchers and Hub-Power, which fell in 
unison, although there were buyers at the dips.
    
Cement shares also came in for active selling and fell under the lead of 
leading among them, notably Cherat Cement, and Mustehkam Cement.
    
Insurance sector was, however, an exception, which did not toe the market's 
general line of action as most of the leading shares attracted good support 
under the lead of Adamjee, Business & General Insurance, Central, IGI and 
EFU Insurance, which rose though modestly.
    
Most of the MNCs played on both sides of the fence amid rolling of 
positions from one counter to the other. While PSO, Engro Chemicals and 
some others managed to finish higher, Shell Pakistan, ICI Pakistan, Reckitt 
and Colman, SK&F and Lever Brothers suffered fall ranging from Rs 1.25 to 
6.
    
Synthetic shares were traded actively as a section of leading operators 
took profits at the inflated levels in line with the market's general 
behaviour.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, off Rs 1.20 on 12.280m 
shares followed by Hub-Power, easy Rs 1.65 on 9.741m shares, Dhan Fibre, 
lower 25 paisa on 2.140m shares, and Dewan Salman, off Rs 3.75 on 1.520m 
shares.
    
The other actives were led by Lucky Cement, off Rs 1.20 on 0.844m shares, 
ICI Pakistan, easy Rs 1.25 on 0.575m shares, Maple Leaf Cement, down 75 
paisa on 0.536m shares, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser lower 90 paisa on 0.506m 
shares, and KESC, easy 25 paisa on 0.413m shares. There were some other 
notable deals also.
    
Trading volume rose to 34.817m shares from the previous 22.638m shares 
thanks to active profit-selling in the pivotals.
    
There were 313 actives, out of which 198 suffered decline and 52 rose, with 
63 holding on to the last levels.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

IN OUR expressive language, Gujerati, this is the question asked of anyone 
who has taken risks and acted stupidly without considering the 
consequences. A literal translation: On the strength of whose father have 
you acted  a question oft asked of a chess player who has moved his queen, 
leaving her bereft of support or defence.
    
I follow on from my column last Friday on the plight of octogenarian 
Professor Nusrat Ashraf.
    
The good news is that contrary to the designs of the abductors, she is not 
dead. Although in pain from her fractured femur and other injuries caused 
to her when abducted and dumped in a Sabzi Mandi flat and then in Edhis 
shelter, she is in good spirits, ready to fight back those who conspired to 
deprive her of her home and possessions: Mein muqaddama karungi, she 
says.
    
In the FIR 85/96 filed by Nusrats cousin, Abdul Khaliq, at the Frere Road 
Police Station, amongst the 20-30 ransackers and abductors four are named: 
Nuzhat Fatima, her brother Faiz Ahmed, Haji Minhal Khan Jatoi, Yousuf 
Chandio.
    
To recap, the day Professor Ashraf was abducted and the breakers commenced 
demolishing her house, a conveyance deed for her property was executed. The 
sellers named were Faiz Ahmed and Haji Minhal. The buyers were three: 
Waseem Yousuf, Mrs Ayesha Jamal (the wife of Brigadier Farouque Afzal) and 
Vishandas Versimal.
    
Of the four named in the FIR, only Nuzhat has so far been arrested, the 
other three using their clout, roam free. Chandio hails from a land-owning 
family of Sindh. Minhal Khan is a resident of the Royal Duchy of Larkana, 
where his family owns the hotels, Gulf and Sapna, reportedly the favourite 
watering holes of ministers, MNAs and wealthy citizens on pilgrimage to the 
august abode.
    
Nuzhat, in custody, was produced before Special Terrorist Court Judge Rafiq 
Awan on May 6 and has been sent to jail charged under PPC Sections: 147 
(rioting), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 342 (wrongful 
confinement), 364 (whoever kidnaps or abducts any person in order that 
such person may be murdered...), 427 (mischief, damage to property, etc), 
13-D (possession of unlicensed arms).
    
When Ms Ashrafs abduction, was reported, the police knew where to find 
her. She was arrested from Sea Breeze Condominium, flats No. 107/108 
belonging to Dr Mustafa Kamal Khan (working in Sharjah) and his sister. 
Unlicensed arms and stolen property in Nuzhats possession were also 
recovered. Towards the end of last year, when the furnished but unoccupied 
flats were opened to the workers, Nuzhat and a group of ten simply walked 
in, threw them out, and forcibly occupied the flats. When Dr Khans sister 
went to find out what was happening, she was abused and threatened. On 
making inquiries, she was told that Nuzhat operated under police 
protection. A widow, living alone with her two children, she did not dare 
file a complaint with the police.
    
Later, on learning that Nuzhat has been arrested, Dr Khans sister appealed 
to Jameel Yusuf of the CPLC for help to recover the two flats.
    
Now, to fathom kaon na baap na jor per?  on whose strength do the 
culprits ride so high?
    
Chandio and Jatoi are protected by MPAs and ministers. Nuzhat Fatima has a 
sister, Rahat Javed, and a brother, Faiz. All claim that they work for our 
agencies. Another brother, Shoaib, who operated a gambling den somewhere 
in North Karachi, in true Chicago gangster-style, was gunned down in a 
barbers shop. The police who arrested Nuzhat, and are now holding her, 
have been warned that her godfather, Tariq Lodhi, will provide licences for 
the unlicensed arms, and will spring her.
    
As is well known, Squadron Leader Tariq Lodhi rose to be the Area Traffic 
Controller at the PAF base, Quetta. 1988: He managed to get a transfer to 
the ISI. 1991: The then DG, General Asad Durrani promoted him. Wing 
Commander Lodhi became the Detachment Commander of Islamabad. 1992: End. 
Transferred to Karachi. 1993: July. The new DG, General Jawaid Ashraf Kazi 
sent him back to PAF Kamra. 1994: Early. PPP 3. Lodhi was recalled to head 
the IB at Karachi. 1995: Mid. Was called to the inner sanctum to replace 
General Raja Saroop and chair the Research and Analysis Committee of the 
PMs secretariat. 1995: End. Though not in the police cadre, he was made 
DIG, special branch, at bomb-prone Lahore. He reports directly to Interior 
Minister General Naseerullah Babar.
    
Police Headquarters in Karachi now receives telephone calls from Lodhi in 
Lahore on the subject of Nuzhat Fatima, about whose predicament he displays 
great concern.
    
Nusrat Ashrafs demolished home and her plot are guarded by armed men from 
Dr Ishtiaqs Muhafiz Security Agency. When I inquired from Ishtiaq as to 
who was paying for the guards, he was on the offensive and would give no 
names, presumably because he was infringing the Code of Conduct of the All 
Pakistan Security Agencies Association, one term of which lays down the 
rule that no security company will guard / protect the interests / property 
of any parties involved in criminal / civil property disputes. Should, 
however, an agency unwittingly become involved, when they do learn about a 
dispute, they immediately withdraw their guards. To prove his bona fides, 
he announced that he was a nephew of Major-General Majid Malik, who later 
denied any family connections.
    
On May 7, two of the three named buyers of Ms Ashrafs property, Waseem 
Yusuf and Vishandas Versimal, and their lawyer Neel Keshav, visited me. 
They claimed that they and the Brigadiers wife, Ayesha Jamal, were the 
innocent victims of a fraud perpetrated by the sellers. They had seen the 
property papers, accepted them as being genuine, and had not suspected foul 
play. I addressed myself to Vishandas: Although you wear a shalwar-kameez 
and have bootblacked your hair, I see you in a Hindu dhoti and kurta 
through which your janoi can be spotted. You are every inch a seasoned 
Hindu-Sindhi banya, one of that large hard- working prosperous clan that 
proliferated in pre-partition days. Just who would take you to be an 
innocent man? I informed him that he had survived in Pakistan, was living 
in a penthouse, and asked him whether he knew that land grabbers, house 
grabbers, and qabza groups, fake documents.
    
I told him how our family had been harassed. A band of goondas, helped by 
the Keamari police, had broken into and forcibly occupied one of our Mules 
Mansions flats, just vacated by an employee of ours, paying no heed to the 
protestations of our chowkidars. They went on to file a civil suit against 
my father and another, attaching fake documents, one of which bore my 
fathers forged signature, stamped and attested by an Additional City 
Magistrate, First Class. The goondas (the plaintiffs) stated that they were 
in physical possession of the flat, and prayed for a permanent injunction 
preventing us from making any effort to dispose of them and repossess our 
property.
    
Vishandas shed his innocent act and pleaded that I, as a senior citizen, 
help settle their dispute. They would provide the professor with a flat. 
Impossible, I told him. You cannot deprive an old, single, helpless woman 
of her family property worth crores, in a desirable area, and then expect 
her to be satisfied with taking some sort of a flat in any old area. If the 
sellers had defrauded them, they should sue them and get their money back.
    
As for Professor Ashraf and her property, her cousins (who have cared for 
her over the years), I, and other concerned citizens, have already been 
soundly advised by sympathetic public-spirited lawyers Sharifuddin Pirzada, 
Khalid Anwer, Gilbert Naim-ur-Rahman, Rustom Virjee, Makhdoom Ali Khan and 
Shahida Jamil, who have all willingly offered their professional services 
and any other assistance to pursue the suit of the distressed professor. 
The usurpers of her property will also have to brave the wrath of her 
erstwhile colleague, Professor Anita Ghulam Ali, the fiery managing 
director of the Sindh Government Educational Foundation.

<a name="sayn">Say no to terrorism</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto

MY life has been struck by terrorism in many forms  terrorism from 
faceless gangs, terrorism sponsored by foreign lands and terrorism by the 
hand of a ruthless dictatorship in my own country.
    
My father, prime minister of Pakistan, was executed by terrorists unleashed 
in the name of the state against the common people. It was a loss that 
steeled my determination to challenge all forms of terrorism, no matter 
under what pretext those acts are committed. To me, terrorism can only be 
described as an exhibition of mindless violence against innocent people  
there can never be proper justification for such acts.
    
But that doesn't stop the excuses from being made. Frantz Fanon, in his 
book "The Wretched of the Earth", asserts that colonised people can become 
whole again by participating in violent politics and that violence used to 
create the colonial world can only be destroyed by violence.
    
What people like Fanon don't understand, however, is that the power of 
violence can never match the overwhelming power that comes from the will 
and determination of a people. Although it is important to maintain a clear 
distinction between terrorism for its own sake and terrorism as part of a 
struggle for self- determination, in either case violence is not the 
answer.
    
If developing nations are to overcome the problems facing them, they will 
do so through a victory over the hearts and minds of the world, and not the 
impact of a bomb.
    
Oftentimes, Islamic extremism has become synonymous with terrorism. Some 
argue that it was the Iranian revolution that began this association in 
people's minds. That, however, was not the case. The Iranian revolution was 
a reaction against the authoritarian Shah, who was seen by the Iranians as 
a "Western" ruler who used torture to crush them. The good that the Shah 
did was buried in a sense of betrayal among his people. But this sense of 
betrayal and anger toward the West did not translate into the rapid spread 
of terrorism that we have seen in the past decade.
    
Rather, it was the Afghan freedom movement that gave birth to real Islamic 
militants across the Muslim world. Trained in religious schools, these 
terrorists believed they had single-handedly beaten the Soviet superpower 
and that violence could solve any and all problems. It is our duty to prove 
that they are mistaken.
    
When Pakistan opposed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, our country was 
the target of numerous bomb blasts and random killings by terrorist gangs 
sent to dissuade us from our position. And, after the Soviet forces had 
been removed, "volunteers" who had gone to Afghanistan from other Muslim 
countries to fight the Soviets also ended up starting their own brand of 
terrorism, using Pakistani soil to stage extremist activities in other 
parts of the world.
    
But Pakistan survived the terrorism of these foreign agents because the 
minds and the hearts of our people were strong. We cleaned up Pakistan, 
extraditing terrorists and expelling extremists who would shed innocent 
blood.
    
For instance, the city of Karachi  my birthplace and a former stronghold 
of extremist elements  has been made peaceful once more. This success was 
not without a price, however, as 250 police and 175 members of my party 
lost their lives in the struggle.
    
Despite these efforts, terrorism, particularly state-sponsored terrorism, 
continues to have a hold on our region. Tens of thousands of people in 
Jammu and Kashmir, for instance, have been killed at the hands of the 
brutal Indian state. "Twenty killed in the valley" is the kind of headline 
that has become a daily routine for Kashmir.
    
Bodies of innocent Kashmiris are discovered daily, brutally tortured and 
thrown away with utter disregard by the Indian security forces. Special 
laws in Indian-held Kashmir give the Indian security forces licence to 
arrest, torture, rape or kill a Kashmiri without any accountability.
    
This is state terrorism at its most despicable, and because of this, India 
has morally and politically lost Kashmir and forced some to turn to 
militancy as a means of last resort.
    
The fundamental truth that will, in the end, lead to our victory over the 
forces of terror in this world is this: Terrorism will only anger the 
decent and honest people of the world and push them to renew themselves to 
the cause.

<a name="imra">Imran and the cynicism of the chattering classes</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

AT this stage of his political career, when he has just got off to an 
uncertain start, it is all too easy for Imran Khan to attract the cynicism 
of the drawing room classes. Quite apart from the fact that the staple 
commodity in which these classes deal is cynicism, Imran Khan has added 
grist to their mills by exposing himself to the charge of contradiction: 
saying things which sit uncomfortably with what he himself was practising 
(and practising with some panache) in the past.
    
This may be an Islamic country but its common people have always been 
suspicious of preachers, which is why the so-called Islamic parties have 
always fared so badly at the polls. Last year when Imran Khan took to 
column-writing (an exercise he has mercifully forsaken) he sounded with his 
born-again Islam very much like a preacher. This grated on the public 
consciousness all the more when it was remembered that in London and 
elsewhere Imran Khan had won as much renown for his cricketing exploits as 
for his success  how gently can I put this?  as a playboy. Someone who is 
inordinately successful with the other sex leaves his fellow-men envious. 
To entertain feelings of envy for a famous Lothario is bad enough. But then 
to see the same person in the guise of a born-again evangelist is to test 
ones patience beyond the limits of human endurance.
    
Imran Khans Brown Sahib philosophy also made him vulnerable to the jibes 
of the drawing room classes. Here was as eminent a Brown Sahib as one could 
think of  Atchison, Oxford and all the other right stops  inveighing 
against something of which he was very much a part. Furthermore, some of 
his thoughts on the drawbacks of representative democracy, the virtues of a 
jirga system and the loss of national self-esteem as a result of our 
colonial experience gave the impression of naivete: of someone who was 
guilty of over-simplification.
    
But one lives and learns. If people were to be judged only by what they had 
done or said once upon a time, few of us would ever Be saved. There was a 
time when I genuinely and sincerely considered the Daughter of the East as 
the answer to Pakistans problems. If that were to be thrown in my face all 
the time, what hope would there be for me? Like other mortals Imran Khan 
too has gained from his experiences. It is no small cause for mercy that he 
has got over his preaching phase. He also seems to have learnt to be more 
discriminating about the company he keeps. I have a lot of respect for 
General Hamid Gul but having heard him expound his fanciful theories on a 
number of occasions I am convinced that no political enterprise in which he 
is involved can ever prosper.
    
But all this should be behind Imran Khan. There is nothing more pointless 
than to live up to the prejudices of Pakistans chattering classes who 
trade in cynicism and whose members hate nothing more than to see one of 
their own strike out on new paths of discovery. The Pakistani 
privilegentsia never forgave Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for speaking in an idiom 
(which is all he did) whose harsh sounds it did not like. The chattering 
classes are unlikely ever to forget Imran Khans contradictions. This 
would matter if these classes were politically important. But for the kind 
of politics that Imran Khan is trying to practise they are totally 
irrelevant. Their support or opposition will not have any effect, one way 
or the other, upon the attitudes of ordinary people because the people have 
yet to discover anything about the chattering classes.
    
Unless Imran has a masochistic streak in him he should keep the revivalist 
streak in him and his Brown Sahib philosophy under a close check because 
when he talks of these things, which are of absolutely no concern to the 
masses, he is merely giving the chattering classes a stick with which to 
beat him.
    
Far better for Imran Khan to stress the other, more substantive part of his 
programme: the determination to strike at the roots of corruption; the need 
to eradicate the VIP culture which is stifling the nation and playing no 
small part in eating up its resources; and the need to give a more just and 
fair deal to the people. Whether Imran Khan is the person who can bring 
about these changes or infuse the Pakistani people with a fresh spirit or 
hope is something which can be open to debate. After all, there has been no 
shortage of do-gooders in Pakistan who have promised great things and then 
done their bit to add to the nations problems. But about one thing there 
should be no dispute: at the present time Imran Khan with his Tehrik-i-
Insaf is the only person on the national scene who is talking of issues of 
burning public concern and who, moreover, is doing so in a manner which can 
be expected to draw a public response.
    
Imran Khan today stands for a movement whose aim is to eradicate corruption 
and give justice to the Pakistani people (by which presumably is meant the 
reform of the police and the criminal justice system because in the 
practical world, as opposed to the world of political rallies, it is only 
practical steps such as these that lead to practical results). This may 
sound like a woolly agenda but at least it is an agenda and it is something 
that the people can identify themselves with. Can anyone say what Benazir 
Bhutto stands for? If there is an election tomorrow what exactly will she 
fight it on? It is all very well to say that she is macro-managing the 
economy. But we have seen the fruits of macro-economic management harvested 
by the Congress-I in India. People are not impressed by hollow slogans 
which have little bearing on their real lives. Macro- management indeed 
when rampant inflation and an excessively high unemployment rate are giving 
an edge to public discontent. Contrast this with high-level corruption and 
the spendthrift and ostentatious ways of the governing classes, and we have 
a situation which is crying out for some kind of deliverance.
    
If Benazir stands for nothing but more of the same, what does Mian Nawaz 
Sharif and the PML-N stand for? It is true that Nawaz Sharif by his 
defiance of Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and subsequently by dint of sheer energy, 
has built a popular constituency for himself and given the Muslim League 
(for the first time since 1947-49) a mass political base. But can anyone 
answer with any certainty as to what Mian Nawaz Sharif will do, what are 
the reforms he will carry out, if he again comes to power? Will Pakistan be 
cleaned of corruption? Will a new political morality hold sway over the 
country? Will nepotism come to an end and will jobs be given only on the 
basis of merit? Will the countrys political masters realise that there is 
something called a conflict of interests whereby it is not considered 
seemly for public officials to use their official positions to further 
their private advantage? Ask any Muslim League stalwart as to what his 
party is doing or will do in the future and he will say we are trying to 
save the country. Edifying as this answer may be, it is not very helpful 
in trying to figure out the nuts and bolts of the Muslim Leagues 
programme.
    
In any case, it is a refrain heard loudly during the last few years that 
there is nothing fundamental which distinguishes the PPP and the Muslim 
League. They are chips off the same block: mouthing the same slogans and 
being represented by people whose class and political background is the 
same. If tomorrow there is a change of government, a different set of 
people will come to power. But in what other respects will the situation 
change? or does the Muslim League have some programmatic aces up its 
sleeves that the rest of the nation has yet to discover?
    
This is a situation in which another alternative is badly needed. Left with 
no other choice, the people will vote either for the PPP or the Muslim 
League. But it should be apparent even to the most obtuse amongst us that 
the people are not enthused by these choices. If they were to have an 
alternative to what is in effect a bipartisan dictatorship of mediocrity, 
the chances cannot be ruled out that they would plump for it.
    
There may be many things wrong with Imran Khan the messenger. But there 
cannot be much quarrel with his message. Scan the political horizon from 
one end to the other and it will be obvious that today if anyone stands for 
change it is him. He is talking of things which the other politicos are 
not. And he is talking of things which touch the real concerns of ordinary 
people. After all, what is at issue is the VIP state whose perks and 
privileges will be the death of Pakistan. If anyone with the right brand 
name and image (an important consideration in politics) has entered the 
lists against this monster, it is Imran Khan. As I say, he may have many 
shortcomings (who of us does not?) but then he must be credited with 
entering the political arena at the right time and with saying just the 
right things. Through his cricketing career and later through his cancer 
hospital he has given sufficient proof of his determination. It would be 
foolish to underestimate such a man.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

BACK from my brief holiday in Nathiagali, I masochistically scan the 
newspapers to catch up. Usual bombast and hot air. Also mayhem and madness.
    
But the text of Imran Khans letter to the Chief Justice of the Supreme 
Court caught my eye. The ex-cricketer and chief of his newly-formed Tehrik-
i-Insaaf has complained about the harassment he is receiving from various 
intelligence agencies. Welcome to the club, Imran. I know that advising him 
has become a cottage industry among my tribe of columnists, but now that he 
has taken the plunge into the sleazy world of politics, he should know that 
he will henceforth have to accept surveillance, phonetaps and irritating 
pinpricks from officialdom as part of his life. In fact, it is almost a 
truism to say that politicians of all stripes are followed and bugged, and 
I do not exclude important members of the ruling coalition.
    
After all, intelligence outfits have to justify their existence and bloated 
budgets. Just to recap, we have the CID, CIA, FIA, IB, MI and the ISI to 
keep an eye on civilians. True, the original mandate of the last two was 
entirely military and strategic, but along the way, a succession of leaders 
decided they werent getting enough information on their opponents, and 
gradually expanded the sphere of their activities. Since our rulers have 
long decreed that dissidence and opposition are synonymous with treason, it 
follows that those who are against the government of the day are traitors 
to be tracked, harried and where possible, jailed.
    
And because our security services are perceived to underpin the government, 
nothing is too good for them. Pampered and cosseted, their agents are the 
elite among public servants. With ever-expanding but unaudited budgets, 
their numbers swell every year despite the sporadic ban on government 
hiring. Their officers are allocated perks and allowances far beyond what 
their lowly colleagues in other services enjoy. They exercise enormous 
clout that enables them to get priority in housing schemes, and whatever 
other benefits they can derive. Above all, they are above the law as they 
go about infringing the fundamental rights of thousands of citizens like 
Imran Khan.
    
But at the end of the day, their output remains unquantified and 
unquantifiable, unless stereotyped reports of the telephone conversations 
and the movements of politicians and senior civil servants can be seen as a 
national asset. If our sleuths were to restrict their time and attention to 
the daily incidents of terrorism, random violence, rampant corruption and 
drug-smuggling that have warped our society, I would have applauded their 
efforts. But they have been directed to concentrate on the activities of 
politicians instead, and the result of these skewed priorities is before 
us.
    
In order to gain favour with the rulers of the day, agencies weave 
intricate webs of conspiracies and plots to play upon the paranoid 
tendencies of insecure politicians. Once they swallow these theories, they 
are hooked. Every chance meeting of opposition leaders is twisted into a 
diabolical plan to destabilise the government; the most innocuous telephone 
conversation is closely studied for clues of conspiracy. The results of 
these half-baked, self-serving analyses are then sent to the chief 
executive of the day with recommendations to step up surveillance.
    
This chain of thought reminds me of the story about the man who used to go 
around the city snapping his fingers. When somebody asked him why, he 
replied: To keep the elephants away. When the curious fellow pointed out 
that there were no elephants within hundreds of miles, the man replied 
triumphantly: See how effective my trick is! Similarly, our omnipresent 
agencies invent non-existent dangers and then claim to have thwarted them.
    
Unfortunately, they are unable to anticipate or penetrate genuine 
conspiracies. When Benazir Bhuttos first administration was ignominiously 
bundled out in 1990, she was the last major player to know about it. 
Granted that the ISI was apparently in on the Aslam Beg-Ghulam Ishaq plot, 
but other agencies should have warned the prime minister. Similarly, 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was given no hint as to the extent of the forces 
arrayed against him in 1977, or about the groundswell building up against 
his government in cities across the country. The PNA movement continued for 
months without our intelligence agencies being able to give any useful 
advice to the government. Equally crucially, General Jilani, the Director 
General of ISI, advised Bhutto to appoint Zia COAS on the grounds of 
personal loyalty.
    
In all these turning points in our history, our secret services had no clue 
about what was going on. Nevertheless, they have continued to influence and 
misguide politicians virtually at will by exploiting their feelings of 
insecurity. Even elected leaders quickly forget that they owe their 
position and their power to the people, and become totally dependent on the 
intelligence community for support and advice. However, when the chips are 
down, these props are exposed for the fragile reeds that they really are.
    
Imran Khan has boasted of the many retired and serving technocrats, 
generals and civil servants who have rallied to his banner. He should 
beware of the natural bias this community has towards secret files and 
bureaucratic fudging. By assuring him that they know the inner working of 
government and will thus guide him to power, they may well gain the ear of 
an inexperienced and rather naive aspirant to power. This is the first step 
towards dependency on the very agencies Imran is complaining about today. 
The fact that his early mentor in politics was none other than a pan-
Islamic ex-Director General of the ISI is replete with irony.
    
How often we have seen politicians in the wilderness railing against the 
oppression of the government. But as soon as they come to power themselves, 
they use the very same tools of oppression, and the same intelligence 
agencies to bully and browbeat those opposing them. Being a cynic, I wonder 
how long it would take for our shadowy sleuths to convince Imran to crack 
down on his political enemies on the grounds of national security if he 
were ever to come to power.
    
These tactics will only be shunned by those in power if and when democratic 
values are truly absorbed, and when the opposition is allowed to play its 
proper role.
   
Equally, the opposition will have to accept the right of the party in power 
to serve its term without constant attempts to topple it through extra-
constitutional means. Until this happens, Imran Khan will have to put up 
with the harassment he may now be undergoing.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="team">Pakistan team for England on 21</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter
 
KARACHI, May 15: The Chairman of the National Selection Committee, Dr Zafar 
Altaf, confirmed that the team for the England tour will not be named on 
Saturday.
    
"We are meeting to discuss various things and have four items on the 
agenda," Altaf said from Islamabad, adding: "The team for the England tour 
will be announced on May 21."
    
"Besides the captain, the manager will also be invited on Tuesday and minor 
changes might be made in consultation with him. The manager will only be 
invited if the Council had announced him before 21st," Altaf clarified.
    
Altaf, about the agenda, said the committee will discuss the fitness and 
psychology of the players, and handling of the British Press besides the 
selection of 17 players for the tour.
    
About the composition of the team, Altaf said it would comprise eight 
batsmen, two wicketkeepers, two spinners and five bowlers. "In eight 
batsmen, there might be three openers or even two. The fact of the matter 
is that in a place like England, every batsman should have the ability to 
play the moving ball because the conditions are wet there. So it doesn't 
make any difference if we selected two openers or three."
    
Altaf said his committee wanted to induct fresh blood in the team but while 
doing so wanted to keep the balance of the team. "We are not only looking 
for the England tour but also for future assignments.
    
The Chief Selector, however, confirmed there would be modifications in the 
team for the one-day series. "We will make a few changes and will send some 
one-day specialists because they are in the last phase of the tour. In 
addition to this, we have to play one-day tournaments in Canada, Kenya and 
Sharjah before travelling to Australia for World Series Cup."

<a name="wasi">Wasim confident about his role as captain</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, May 11: Pakistan cricket captain Wasim Akram has said that he is 
glad that Pakistan Cricket Board has shown confidence in his captaincy and 
he has enough time to try out various theories and other stuff in the team 
before the England tour begins. The skipper was talking to this 
correspondent at the end of the second days trials at KRL cricket field, 
on Saturday.
    
Im glad that they have done such a thing and the boys have backed me up, 
because the captain needs stable conditions to try out different theories 
for which I think I have enough time to do that.
    
About his own fitness Wasim said that gradually he is improving and by the 
time the English tour starts he will find his rhythm. We have more than 15 
days in England to gear up for the game, he said.
    
The total count at the national trials termed as `re-grouping reached 24 
out of the 41 invited by selection committee at KRL.

During the evening session Wasim Akram played some aggressive strokes, 
including hitting a towering six while Waqar Younis, the recipient of Pride 
of Performance Award was seen in full flow. Ejaz Ahmed, Rashid Khan, Mustaq 
Ahmed looked fit, while Saeed Azad, and Azam Khan struggled and they may 
adjust to the conditions.
    
Col. Noushad, member selection committee indicated that the re-grouping 
process may be wound up after the morning session on Sunday if more players 
do not participate. We will have a morning session with the players who 
have joined, we will look into all the aspects to see if another session is 
required in the evening, he said at the close of second days session 
here.
    
The selector added that the main objective for the re-grouping was to try 
to get the right adjustments while assessing the team from various angles 
which includes fitness, cricketing potential etc. We have to make certain 
adjustments and accordingly besides, watching the established cricketer, 
their fitness, we are also watching youngsters to finalise the team.
    
The re-grouping is also aimed at trying to tap potential all- rounder in 
order to fill in the void created by Imran Khans retirement. The selector 
stated that it was one of the important reasons and owing to forthcoming 
load of one-day  games, the committee is also looking into tapping 
promising all rounder. We have a number of one-day games during the tour, 
and naturally, we are looking into this aspect of the team which is a must 
to win matches, he said.

<a name="inza">Inzamam surprises all with his fitness</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, May 13: Inzamamul Haq surprised all and sundry at the National 
Stadium when he appeared for United Bank in the Pentangular Cup final in a 
new style.
    
Inzamam, who was facing axe from the England tour because of doubts over 
his fitness, shocked the followers of the game when he appeared in a 
physical shape he has never been in his career.
    
The Multan batsman has lost more than 20 pounds of weight while his waist 
has been reduced to 35 from 38.
    
The once burly batsman showed no signs of any knee injury when he remained 
in the field throughout Allied Banks innings and even picked up two good 
catches. He was not only sharp in the slips, he was agile in the close-in 
position on the bowling of Tauseef Ahmad and Mohammad Husain.
    
A few sprints before the ball further confirmed that he has completely 
recovered from the injury that had been hampering him for the past couple 
of years.
    
I was not relaxing in Multan as rumours were. I was training and really 
training hard because I had realised that if I would be dropped it would be 
because of fitness and not form, Inzamam said.
    
The batsman with a Test average of 44 said he not only trained for four 
hours daily, he also controlled his diet. I am not taking any food which 
is increasing my calories or fats. I am also not eating up to my throat 
because I realise that my physique responds immediately to rich or heavy 
food.
    
Inzamam, after the close of play on the opening day, went to PIA Squash 
Complex for physical session of two hours. I am determined to get even 
fitter because I have now reached the conclusion that the knee injury I had 
was only because I was overweight.

<a name="inte">International hockey Preparing for Junior World Cup contest</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

Though we had reclaimed the seniors World Cup hockey at Sydney in 1994 
after a lapse of 12 years, the juniors (under-21) World Cup has yet to be 
regained as Pakistan had miserably failed to do so in its previous four 
attempts.
    
Having won the inaugural 1979 juniors World Cup, Pakistan finished third 
thrice in 1982 at Kuala Lumpur, in 1985 at Vancouver and in 1989 at Ipoh. 
In 1993, however, we managed to reach Barcelona juniors World Cup final to 
get the silver medals. Pakistan juniors performance in the four successive 
cups was doubly disappointing as despite tall claims we could not recapture 
the title.
    
In the absence of any systematic or objective study one can assume that 
there had been something wrong in spotting talented youngsters for final 
selection of a Pakistan side and also in the management and training of our 
players resulting in our four successive failures.
    
Next year the sixth juniors World Cup will be staged in England. 
Preparations for raising a winning combination had been put in operation 
for about two years by providing foreign tours to our juniors which 
included participation in the world youth hockey festival which Pakistan 
won at Islamabad last year.
    
The juniors teams first target is a qualification round during the coming 
11-nation Juniors Asia Cup, scheduled at Singapore, from May 29.
    
Three teams will qualify from the Asia Cup for the 1997 Juniors World Cup 
in England to be contested among nine nations which included Germany, 
Australia, the Netherlands, being the most formidable challengers to the 
three Asian qualifiers.
    
The 11-nation in the run for three qualifiers places at Singapore are 
Pakistan, India, South Korea, Malaysia, hosts Singapore, Japan, China, 
Uzbekistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lank and Thailand.

<a name="jans">Jansher wants to stay in top form for some years</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

PESHAWAR, May 11: World squash champion Jansher Khan is leaving here for 
Cairo on Wednesday (May 15) for participation in the 1,00,000 U.S. dollars 
Egypt Open scheduled for May 17 to 22.
    
Informally talking to newsmen at a local hotel on Saturday, where the world 
champion was guest of honour of the Servis Industries, he said he was 
confident to continue his present form and winning spree for another five 
to six years and would like to bring the country as many laurels which no 
other player will be able to break. Giving reasons for reducing 
participation in the world circuit tournaments to 8 from an average of 12 
he said he wanted to play only in top contests which carry high prize money 
and maximum points so as to keep his number one position in the world 
ranking.
    
Jansher Khan further said after the Egypt Open which would be the last big 
tournament of the present circuit, he would be going to U.S. Open in the 
next circuit starting from July.
    
Responding to a question, the world champion expressed his optimism that a 
couple of young squash players from Pakistan, would emerge on the 
international circuit in next few years to give a hope of retaining the 
world championship when he passes his climax and has to quit. Presently, he 
said all the world top rankings from 2 to 9 were dominated by players other 
than Pakistans.
    
Explaining reasons for his participation in Egypt Open Jansher said it was 
for gaining maximum points since the tournament carried maximum prize 
money, even more than the coveted British Open. He expressed confidence 
that his number one position will not change in the upcoming circuits since 
he was 400- 500 points ahead of number 2.
    
To a query, Jansher said in his meeting with Pakistan Squash Federation 
(PSF) president Air Chief Marshal Abbas Khattak the other day, he was given 
an assurance that his suggestions for the improvement of the game would be 
given due weightage. He said he had advised the PSF to send junior players 
to participate in tournaments abroad to get maximum playing experience 
instead of featuring more and more within the country. When questioned 
about his reluctance to the proposal forwarded to him by the PSF president 
to contribute 5% of his income towards the promotion of squash in the 
country, he said, in fact he had said that he was too busy on the 
international circuit right now and cannot make himself available in 
personal participation in the games promotional activities. So far as the 
contribution of money was concerned, he said he was ready to go by the 
suggestion. All he desired was that squash championship should be retained 
by the country even if he was out of form and game and he would do his best 
to this end.

ISLAMABAD, May 11: Pakistan Greens by routing India 3-0 in the final of the 
Quaid-i-Azam International Volleyball tournament today proved that their 
victory over the archrivals in the penultimate round was no flash in the 
pan. The gathering at the Liaquat Gymnasium gave a sonorous applause to the 
home team as it upset the applecent of the archrivals.
    
Pakistan took just 51 minutes to demolish India in clean straight sets 15-
5, 15-4, 15-2. At no stage during the game the traditional rivals could 
match the aggression of the hosts. By comparison the opening set produced 
the best game from the opponents who obviously struggling mainly owing to 
defective reception kept Pakistan engaged for 23 minutes. The Indians 
were so low in spirits that they gave away as many as five points due to 
their own mistakes.
    
The Greens spikers, on the contrary, blocked three opponents first attacks, 
including the set point against 5, over the net to completely shackle their 
side.
    
The story of Indian setback continued in the second set with much greater 
force, as Pakistan grabbed the set in 17 serves in 13 minutes with southpaw 
Ghulam Abbas and Mazhar Hussain shining with seven points.
    
The chances of a fightback from the opponents turned dim once Pakistan 
built a 6-0 lead following which Indias Kamal Singh won a service point 
while a Reddy-Thulasi blocking made it 2-6, but that was all India could 
get as the vibrant Greens spikers, encouraged by home crowd, ran away with 
the set and the final at 15-2.
    
As reported earlier, Indias complete reliance on spiker Amir Singh to 
receive the ball proved a loss, as the spiker struggled with an aggravated 
right shoulder muscle injury. He was replaced in the second set and 
reintroduced in the third but failed to produce anything spectacular.
    
Secretary Sports and Culture, Hassan Raza Pasha, gave away the medals and 
trophy at the end.</pre>
