<a href="#isla">Islamabad ready for talks on Kashmir: PM</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, April 10: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto reiterated Pakistan's 
stance for holding a meaningful dialogue with India to solve the long-
standing Kashmir issue.
    
The dispute, Benazir said, continues to cast a dark shadow on the 
security environment of South Asia.

She said the people of Jammu and Kashmir have been waging a valiant 
struggle to determine their own destiny despite the massive use of 
brutal military force by India.

ISLAMABAD, April 10: Pakistan has told the envoys of the Aid to Pakistan 
Consortium that it could not reduce its defence budget nor alter its 
peaceful nuclear programme in view of India's continued huge military 
build up in the region.
    
Informed sources said that Prime Minister's Adviser on Finance Mr V.A. 
Jafarey briefed the pre-consortium meeting of the European envoys about 
the overall economy of the country with special reference to 
justification of the high defence expenditure and pursuance of the 
peaceful nuclear programme.
    
The other major points of the written agenda of the pre-consortium 
meeting which were discussed were: the IMF's certificate of Pakistan's 
economic health, successful privatisation process, discussion on poverty 
assessment and social sectors (successes of SAP-1 and intended SAP-2), 
report by resident representative of the UNDP on the proposal for Local 
Dialogue Group (LDG).
    
The envoys, sources claimed, expressed their confidence in the 
improvement of Pakistan economy and accepted the IMF's certificate of 
health in this regard.
    
Pakistan has sought about 2.7 billion dollars from the Aid to Pakistan 
Consortium which is meeting in Paris on April 22. Pakistani officials 
when contacted said that the envoys have appreciated macro economic 
stability and reforms for restructuring the economy. They said that they 
were confident that Paris club would accept Pakistan's request for 
enhanced assistance for 1996-97 compared to 2.2 billion dollars of the 
current year.
    
Mr Jafarey told the envoys that Pakistan was quite confident to achieve 
6.5 per cent GDP growth rate for the current year and said the next year 
target was expected to be fixed at little over 7 per cent. He said 
exports have registered an upward trend specially in February this year 
after having faced problems in the beginning of the January.

<a name="brow">Brown says Pakistan to get back arms, money</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 9: US Senator Hank Brown declared that Pakistan would 
soon receive the military equipment withheld since 1990, but admitted 
that there were hitches in the reimbursement of the money paid for 28 F-
16s, as well as in resumption of economic assistance, on account of 
speculation about the transfer of nuclear technology to Islamabad by 
Beijing.
    
As author of the Brown Amendment, he was confident that Pakistan would 
receive the money and equipment because Americans would never allow the 
administration to hold back the arms and the money paid by Pakistan 
before the Pressler Amendment.
    
He, however, acknowledged differences of opinion between Pakistan and 
the United States on certain issues, but hastened to add that such 
irritants would not erode the firm foundations of friendship set by the 
passage of the Brown Amendment.
    
"This is the first step towards renewal of our friendship," he told a 
news conference, saying that America had great admiration for Pakistan. 
Despite calculated leaks in Washington about Pakistan's nuclear 
programme and anti-Pakistan lobbies on the Capitol Hill, Mr Brown struck 
a note of optimism, predicting deep friendship between the two 
countries. However, he said the NPT and CTB would be the 'subject of 
discourse between the two for many years to come.'
    
He also predicted that in the long run Pakistan and India would become 
good friends because of regional economic interests. Asked how long was 
long in his opinion, he was unable to give a specific period but said 
once the Kashmir issue was resolved, which even the United States wants 
settled, the two neighbours could become friends as opposed to enemies.
    
To a question about him being refused an Indian visa, he clarified: "I 
was told I should come another time because of the Indian governments 
preoccupation with the forthcoming elections. I look forward to my visit 
to India and Kashmir to try to understand the Kashmir problem."

To a question about the 'missing' 280 million dollars which Pakistan was 
claiming it had paid and the US was denying, Sen Brown emphatically 
replied: "Non-tallying of accounts is quite normal. There is nothing 
wrong or mystical about it."

<a name="paki">Pakistan sure of its N-arms capability</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, April 8: Gary Milhollin, a professor at the University of 
Wisconsin Law School and Director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear 
Arms Control told the Washington Times in an interview that Pakistan had 
not tested their device so far because `they have judged that the 
negative effects would be greater than the benefits.'
    
In an accompanying piece on the size of the global nuclear arsenal, the 
newspaper reported Pakistan had nearly 12 first-generation fission 
bombs, deliverable by aircraft and possibly missiles. The warheads are 
considered reliable and Chinese components have been imported to boost 
nuclear warhead production.
    
India, it said, had 20 to 50 first-generation fission bombs and was 
preparing for a second nuclear test, while Israel possessed 100 to 200 
nuclear warheads, some with thermonuclear fusion. These warheads are 
deliverable by aircraft or missiles capable of reaching targets 
throughout the Middle East.
    
Milhollin said Pakistan had a uranium warhead that can be delivered by 
aerial bombs that the United States thinks are quite reliable.

<a name="call">Pakistan calls for arms embargo in Afghanistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Our Correspondent

UNITED NATIONS, April 10: Pakistani and Afghan diplomats crossed swords 
during a debate in the United Nations Security Council which at the end 
offered no tangible or workable solution for the festering Afghan 
conflict which threatens to destroy peace in the region.
    
Afghanistan's Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai, accused 
Pakistan of perpetuating the conflict.
    
Pakistan's delegate, Ahmad Kamal, maintained that the "nominal central 
authority on self extended term" in Kabul controlled only five of the 
thirty-two provinces, while the Taliban controlled more than half the 
country and were locked in a struggle with the nominal central 
authority. A quarter was controlled by General A.R. Dostum and other 
smaller factions.
    
In order to control the unabated flow of arms into Kabul, Pakistan 
called for the United Nations mandated arms embargo on Afghanistan to 
stop the loads of ammunition being flown into the country. 
    
It also suggested convening of a representative gathering of Afghan 
leaders under United Nations umbrella in order to launch the intra-
Afghan peace process.
    
The United States delegate, Edward Gnehm, in a speech earlier, said, "We 
are aware that several countries are considering an arms embargo on 
Afghanistan. We believe this is worth exploring further if it could be 
effectively implemented."

<a name="pled">Islamabad pledges $1m for Azeris </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 10: Pakistan pledged one million dollars in 
humanitarian assistance to Azerbaijan for its refugees who had fled 
their homes due to Armenian aggression in Nogorno Karabakh. Azerbaijan, 
on the other hand offered to continue its unequivocal support to 
Islamabad on Kashmir.
    
"We are deeply moved by the plight of Azeri refugees and would like to 
make a token assistance of one million dollars for their 
rehabilitation," Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto declared.
   
Referring to the signing of nine agreements between the two countries, 
Ms Bhutto told a questioner that Pakistan will always stand by 
Azerbaijan on the Armenian question because: "Aggression must not be 
rewarded and we will always raise our voice against it wherever it takes 
place." She lauded President Aliyev for initiating a democratisation 
process in his country and the establishment of a free market economy.
    
She said among the agreements signed, the "most important" were 
convention on avoidance of double taxation, agreement on consular 
issues, the consular convention, the memoranda of understanding in the 
field of tourism and in the sphere of sports. "These have laid concrete 
foundation for further strengthening of our bilateral relations," 
declared the prime minister.

<a name="bill">Billions lost in Lahore dry port inferno</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sajid Iqbal

LAHORE, April 8: Imported goods worth billions were gutted when fire 
broke out in the largest covered shed of the Lahore Dry Port.
    
While the railway police and customs officials said that they were 
ascertaining the causes of fire by an inquiry body, however, none gave a 
convincing explanation of the lapse that caused the colossal loss. News 
agency PPI estimated the initial loss at rupees two billion, but other 
reports say the loss could be more.
    
The fire started at 5.30pm in a heap of scrap plastic outside E-shed, 
the flames enveloped the whole shed shortly after. The shed was burning 
till our going to the press. Brand new imported tyres put near the shed 
walls were burnt to ashes. A few containers lying beside also caught 
fire at around 8pm but the fire fighting staff succeeded in overcoming 
the blaze there. No loss of life was reported.
    
"The fire which erupted in a waste scrap lying in the Dry Port area for 
the last three years, engulfed the shed containing local and imported 
tyres, plastic material, imported cloth, machinery, chemicals and other 
industrial raw material," said Asad Khan, an importer of scrap at the 
Lahore Dry Port. He complained that the fire-fighting staff of Pakistan 
Railways reached the spot at 6pm, half an hour after the start of fire. 
"No lift machine was available to move the containers stationed near the 
shed," he complained.
    
The E shed of the Lahore Dry Port is one of the five covered sheds 
having more covered area than all the four other sheds taken together. 
It was the latest addition to the Lahore Dry Port building.

Mr Sarfraz Khan said an Assistant Director of Customs Intelligence, who 
had come for the inspection of some imported goods, left the E shed at 
4.30pm while the fire was reported to him an hour later.

Fire-fighting staff of the Railways, Metropolitan Corporation, Civil 
Aviation Authority and Pakistan Air Force were battling the flames. 
However, 16 vehicles on the job were found to be insufficient in face of 
the huge blaze which exposed the inefficient security arrangements at 
the dry port.

<a name="stri">Strike multiplies patients' sufferings</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, April 4: While a strike affects the normal activity of the city 
with varying degrees, it definitely hampers most of the performance of 
the city hospitals, particularly of those run by the public sector.
    
In the last two days of strike in Karachi, hundreds of scheduled major 
and minor surgical operations could not take place owing to a variety of 
reasons. The Civil Hospital, District South, was the hardest hit where 
more than 100 major surgeries were cancelled or postponed.
    
However, emergency operations in all the big city hospitals, including 
the CHK, continued to be performed.
    
The number of daily operations runs into three figures at Civil Hospital 
where, according to its deputy medical superintendent, routine 
operations were postponed.
    
According to Prof Karim Siddiqui of Civil Hospital, the cases postponed 
in these two days would become a backlog and those who were scheduled to 
have been operated upon during these two days would now have their turn 
subject to the situation of the future lists.

"Such a situation not only results in loss of time and money, but it 
also leads to added load on emergency," said Dr Sher Shah, medical 
superintendent of Sobhraj Maternity Home.

However, the number of road accident cases is reduced during strike days 
owing to less traffic which in turn reduces the number of orthopaedic 
and neuro-surgery cases reported to hospitals, said another CHK staff 
who takes care of all the nine operation theatres at hospital.

<a name="kara">Karachi to have five district corporations</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 4: Karachi's municipal government is to be decentralised 
again. There will now be five district corporations though the `mother' 
Metropolitan Corporation will continue to exist. But all of them will be 
controlled by bureaucrats  the district corporations by the deputy 
commissioners and the KMC by the commissioner, according to a bill to be 
moved in the Sindh Assembly shortly.
    
If passed, the bill will also affect the status of the Karachi Water and 
Sewerage Board and the two building controlling authorities.
    
Now, according to the proposed bill, there will be five `district 
corporations,' instead of the four ZMCs, the fifth one being for the 
newly created Malir district.
    
More important, the bill will detach the Karachi Water and Sewerage 
Board from the KMC and turn it into an independent board with the chief 
minister as chairman. Its managing director, to be appointed by the 
chief minister, will be the chief executive.
    
While the new scheme will naturally involve a redistribution of powers 
between the KMC and the DMCs, its financial implications do not augur 
well for the city, unless the provincial government chooses to make the 
KWSB financially viable by large doses of provincial, federal and 
foreign aid instead of making the KMC give more money to the water 
agency.
    
Besides, the distribution of the KMC's finances into six bodies will 
completely erode its ability to run maternity homes and hospitals, 
including Abbasi Shaheed, and over 500 schools, besides sanitation.

<a name="cons">Conservation plan envisages 150.7b investment</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, April 6: As many as 68 projects in 14 core areas have been 
identified by the federal government in its National Conservation 
Strategy (NCS) aimed at efficient use and conservation of natural 
resources with the help of the private sector.
    
The NSC, approved by the federal government in March 1992, envisages 
investment of a huge amount of Rs 150.7 billion up to the year 2001. Of 
this Rs 61.1 billion will be funded by the government by revamping some 
of its ongoing and some future projects in specialised fields. About 59 
per cent of the remaining investment (estimated to be Rs 52 billion) is 
expected to be made by the private sector, whose involvement is being 
given great importance by the government.
    
A federal government report indicated that the NCS would make a 
significant impact on 18 economic sectors. A significant part of it 
would be the importance of community-based management of resources. The 
report also envisaged approximately 800,000 jobs within the next decade.
    
The 14 core areas identified by the NCS where investment is to be made 
include maintaining soils in crop lands, increasing irrigation 
efficiency, protecting watersheds, supporting forestry and plantation, 
restoring rangelands and improving livestock, protecting water bodies 
and sustaining fisheries, conserving biodiversity, increasing energy 
efficiency, developing and deploying renewables, preventing pollution, 
managing urban wastes, supporting institutions from resources, 
integrating population and environment programmes and preserving the 
cultural heritage.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, April 8: The Minister for Education, Syed Khursheed Shah, 
told the National Assembly that under the Eighth Plan, out of a total 
allocation of Rs69.031 billion, Rs39.31 billion had been allocated for 
basic education.
    
Mobile and crash teachers training programmes of short-term duration had 
been launched for the expansion in teacher training network, the 
minister said, adding that a district basic education survey had been 
made to develop district basic education plan for all the four 
provinces.
    
Apart from motivational campaigns, he said, primary education had also 
been made compulsory through legislation in Punjab.
    
The minister further said that a project for the establishment of 10,000 
non-formal basic education schools at the national level had been 
approved and was being launched in the provinces.
    
To another question, Mr Shah, referring to the World Bank Atlas, 1996, 
said, "Pakistan stands at 194 among 209 countries" as regards the 
literacy rate.

<a name="glob">Global warming Rise in sea level to hit Pakistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 6: Pakistan is among the 10 developing countries which 
will be seriously affected by the rise in sea level due to global 
warming within the next 20 to 30 years.
    
No less frightening, Dr S. Taseer Husain, the internationally respected 
scientist of Pakistan-origin, said is the sudden outbreak of cholera 
epidemic that may occur any moment in the South Asian region. For a new 
strain of cholera, presumed to be an effect of environmental change, has 
been discovered in the algae in the Bay of Bengal.
    
The World Health Organisation is aware of it but the problem is that 
there is no vaccine against this particular strain, observed Dr Taseer, 
a pioneer in environmental palaeontology and research on relationship 
between climate change and public health and a member of advisory 
committees of the United Nations and NATO on science and technology.
    
Currently, he is associated with the Faculty of Medicine, Howard 
University, USA. He shared the findings of latest international research 
with local scientists in the course of his lecture on `Human Influences 
on Geological Environments' which was organised by the Minrock 
Foundation, a subsidiary of the Geological Survey of Pakistan.
    
Even by a conservative estimate, 20 centimetre uplift in sea level will 
inundate large parts of the United States and Europe as well as the 
developing world, including Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, the Maldives, 
Indonesia, Senegal, Mozambique, Thailand, Egypt, Surinam and Gambia.

What, in terms of greenhouse effect, was done by the industrialised 
world in 200 years, the developing world can bring about in a matter of 
decades owing to sheer preponderance in demographics, he remarked.
   
The latter should, therefore, strive for the kind of development that is 
environmentally and economically sustainable. `If we don't take these 
challenges, we will have only ourselves to blame.'

<a name="euto">EU to study sanctions against Pakistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shadaba Islam

BRUSSELS, April 10: The European Union's 15 member states will once 
again study international trade unions' demands for ending trade 
benefits for Pakistan because of the alleged use of child labour in the 
country.
    
A meeting of the EU's so-called "advisory management committee" on the 
Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) is scheduled to meet on May 7 
and 8 to discuss the problem of labour standards in Pakistan.
    
Sources say the European Commission, which runs the EU's preferential 
trade scheme for developing countries, is seeking "a final opinion" from 
EU governments before it takes a decision on whether or not to 
investigate the trade unions' claims.
    
The ICFTU has produced what its officials describe as "hard evidence" of 
the employment of children in Pakistan's carpet industry. Under the EU's 
new GSP rules, countries accused of using forced labour can lose their 
preferential trade advantages. The withdrawal of the GSP benefits can be 
"partial, temporary or total".

That's easier said than done, however. EU countries are still deeply 
divided over the wisdom of using trade sanctions to improve labour 
conditions in the developing world.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="govt">Govt decides to privatise revenue collection</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 4: The federal government has decided to privatise the 
assessment and revenue collection of the country's major business 
markets.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here that the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) 
has started a major exercise in this regard with a view to increasing 
the overall revenue collection.

Secretary Privatisation Commission, Mr. Abdullah Yousef, and Member 
Income Tax of the CBR, Mr.Iqbal Farid, have been asked to deliberate the 
issue in the light of the directive given by Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto.
    
A significant portion of Customs duties are already being collected by a 
private international import appraising firm M/S Cotecna. It is said to 
have once again signed a fresh agreement with the government to collect 
revenue for 1996-97.

Now the CBR is examining a proposal given by the PPP MNA Khalid Javed 
Gurki to privatise the collection of presumptive income tax of shops of 
Lahores Liberty Market. Sources said Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has 
agreed with the proposal and sent it to the officials of the CBR for 
detailed study and action.
    
The CBR has acquired documents from Karachi about Cotecna to study the 
case in detail in order to evolve a workable arrangement under which the 
collection of presumptive shop tax in Lahore's Liberty Market could be 
contracted out to Khalid Javed Gurki, the only PPP MNA who was able to 
win a National Assembly seat from the ten-seat city.
    
Presumptive shop tax was first imposed about five years ago. It brought 
in a good amount of revenue in the first year. But in the following 
years the collection declined to nothing because of collusion between 
the CBR collectors and the shop keepers. As a result shopping centres 
which had a turn-over of millions of rupees a day were paying paltry 
amounts in taxes.

<a name="with">Withdrawal of Sales Tax exemption to bring Rs1.2bn</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 6: Prime Ministers Advisor on Finance and Economic 
Affairs Mr. V. A. Jafarey has said that the withdrawal of sales tax 
exemption on 46 items would provide additional revenue of Rs 1.2 billion 
annually to the government.
    
"This decision will have a good impact on revenue and would reduce the 
government borrowings and largely curtail our budget deficit", he 
further stated.
    
Mr. Jafarey said that the government has not levied any additional taxes 
over which the opposition should make any hue and cry.  We have only 
withdrawn sales tax exemptions on various items through an executive 
order, he said adding that the measure had the necessary legal 
protection and could not be challenged.
    
Asked to comment on statement of former finance minister Senator Sartaj 
Aziz that his party would go to the high court against the decision, he 
said let them adopt any course they want because we have not done any 
thing illegal or unconstitutional.

<a name="revi">Review of tax on stock exchanges' income demanded</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Our Reporter

KARACHI, April 7: The Karachi Stock Exchange wants the government to 
exempt tax on bonus shares, wealth tax on shares of listed companies, 
end harassment of tax payers and to review tax on income of stock 
exchanges.
    
These proposals are incorporated in a draft sent to the Advisory 
Council, Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, for consideration 
in its meeting on April 9 at Islamabad.

It also contended that in the larger interest of the capital market and 
development of the economy, shares of the listed companies be exempted 
from wealth tax, especially since they are risk oriented savings 
instruments.
    
The draft proposal also urged the government to review the withdrawal of 
deduction of wealth tax from taxable income.
    
It also urged the government to make the income of stock exchanges tax 
free because these institutions were not profit oriented entities.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange urged the government to implement its 
commitment to the capital market, allowing development expenditure of 
stock exchanges on research, automation and modernisation as deductible 
expenses against their taxable income.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 6: The Export Processing Zones Authority will set up 
software technology parks at Karachi and Islamabad.
    
Chairman, Export Processing Zones Authority, S. T. R. Zaidi, in an 
interview said the project would be undertaken as a joint venture with 
the Pakistan software board.
    
A firm of Singapore is likely to provide assistance in implementing the 
project. The firms representatives have shown keen interest in the 
project after visiting the site, EPZA chief said. The project is part of 
the EPZA diversification programme under which the remaining parts of 
the Karachi Export processing Zone would be devoted to diverse 
industries.

Zaidi said 100 acres of land would now be earmarked for the software 
technology park while 150 acres would be developed for other industries.
    
The government has appointed Nespak as a consultant to work out details 
of the project including cost estimates, layout plans and PC I, he said 
adding that the systems of KEPZ were working smoothly and exports from 
zone have increased.

is expected to issue it soon and the National Assembly will adopt it at 
its next session.
    
Officials at the Ministries of Finance and Commerce are said to have

Various trade bodies and chambers of commerce too had called for 
enforcing anti-dumping duties, specially keeping in view the threat from 
China and India.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 8: One of the three gas pipeline projects for import of 
gas either from Iran, Qatar or Turkmenistan will be operational by the 
end of this century.
    
"We have also decided to allow Iran to extend gas pipeline to India 
through Pakistan's land route," said the Minister for Petroleum Mr Anwar 
Saifullah Khan.
    
He also believed that economic inter-dependence and co-operation would 
make India and Pakistan sit across the table to resolve their 
outstanding disputes.
    
Referring to gas import projects, Anwar Saifullah said that the gas 
demand-supply would be around 1.5-3 billion cubic feet per day by the 
end of year 2000 and it could rise up to 10 bcfpd by the year 2010.
    
"Every effort is being made to, at least, make one of the three gas 
pipeline projects for import of gas either from Iran, Qatar or 
Turkmenistan operational by the end of this century," he said adding 
that Islamabad has allowed Iran to sell its gas to India via Pakistan 
with a view to have good friendly political and economic relations with 
New Delhi.

<a name="cott">Cotton growers harvest second crop</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Aslam

KARACHI, April 9: The progressive cotton growers of the lower Sindh 
cotton belt have successfully harvested a second crop for the first time 
in Pakistans history and their experience has created interest in the 
other major growing areas of the country.
    
The idea to harvest a second crop from the earlier sown plants 
originated, probably on the pattern of sugarcane, in the minds of some 
progressive growers as after the final picking they did not destroy the 
plants as has been the practice since time immemorial but watered them 
with due dozes of fertiliser and other inputs.
    
"The result was simply amazing as within two months there was normal 
flowering and maturing of bolls, paving the way for fresh picking," said 
a leading grower.
    
After the final picking in December, growers generally destroy the 
plants or use it for burning purposes but after the new experiment they 
water the leafless plants, which grow like normal crop and mature in 
late March for picking.
    
The cotton in the lower Sindh belt is sown a bit earlier during the 
month of February and March and it matures by the middle of July or 
August and in late November or early December plants are destroyed to 
sow wheat crop by rotation.
    
"We call it a test tube cotton as it has no staple length or micronaire 
but is widely used for blending purposes to produce fine quality yarn,"
growers said.
    
Most of the spinners are after each lot of the test tube cotton as its 
blending with the normal variety gives a tremendous boost to fine 
quality of cotton yarn meant for exports.
    
I have 1,500 maunds of the new cotton crop ready for sale in my ginnery 
and have buying offers around Rs 850 per maund but I will not sell it 
below Rs 950, said a ginner. Although the size of the second crop is 
still to be determined in terms of quantity but as the arrivals showed 
it run into thousands of maunds.

<a name="worl">World Bank wants terms met before loan talks</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, April 10: The World Bank has told Pakistan that no further talks 
will be held for a $800 million loan unless Islamabad enacts legislation 
for the establishment of provincial irrigation and drainage authorities 
(PIDAs) and submits a rolling business plan for the first three years.
    
The federal government, official sources said, has informed provincial 
governments about the World Bank's condition, which, it is said by the 
bank, is meant to ensure that the establishment of the PIDAs was not 
delayed.
    
The sources said Pakistan needed the loan for its budget for the year 
1996-97 and wanted the provincial governments to take early steps for 
the establishment of the PIDAs.
    
Experts say that the World Bank is wrong in its assertion that after 
implementation of the new system, the farmers will get water according 
to their requirements. "This is simply not possible. Water available in 
Pakistan is not sufficient to meet all irrigation requirements of the 
country and lands get less water than their needs. If water is sold like 
the World Bank is suggesting, big farmers will buy it all, leaving the 
small farmers in a state of helplessness. They will be left with no 
option but to sell their lands and seek some other source of 
livelihood," experts say.
    
An important provision in the legislation proposed by the World Bank is 
that any farmer who fails to pay his water charges on time will have his 
water supply disconnected. "This is the best way to starve the poor 
farmers", experts say. "Once irrigation water is disconnected during the 
season, entire crop will be destroyed and the farmer will get punished 
along with his family for the whole year."

<a name="stra">Stray covering purchases in leading scrips</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, April 10: Leading shares on the Karachi Stock Exchange came in 
for stray covering purchases at the lower levels but bulk of the buying 
remained centred around some current favourites.
    
The KSE 100-share index recovered in part the last three sessions' 
losses at 1,548.91 as against the previous 1,545.05, showing an increase 
of 3.86 points.

After steep early week decline in response to withdrawal of sales tax 
exemptions on about four dozen items, which could well mean cost-push, 
the market showed resistance to larger fall after mid-week but the 
technical rally could not manifest itself.

What seemed to have taken technical steam out of the market was said to 
be Opposition's threat to launch a drive against the government to 
unseat it.

The heating up of the political scenario could lead to a fresh 
confrontation among the contenders of power and that is a bad thing for 
the already battered market, most analysts believe.

Bank shares did attract modest support under the lead of MCB, Citicorp, 
Bank al-Habib and some others but short-covering did not go beyond 
filling in some technical gaps.
    
ICP mutual funds were also traded lower, although fractionally barring 
ICP SEMF, which managed to show resistance to larger decline and so did 
most of the modarabas and leasing shares.
    
After early distinct weakness under the lead of Adamjee Insurance, some 
of the leading insurance shares including Adamjee, EFU Life, Askari Life 
and some others recovered but Dadabhoy remained under pressure, losing 
heavily in each session.
    
Synthetic shares were traded modestly after the withdrawal of sale tax 
exemptions as even most active them including Dhan Fibre, and Ibrahim 
Fibre lacked normal speculative activity.
    
All eyes remained centred on Lucky Cement as did on Hub-Power in the 
energy sector as investors were not inclined to move out of them even 
for a short-term. Both were massively traded amid either-way movements. 
Leading among them including PSO, and Pakistan Oilfields fell.
    
Auto shares came in for stray covering purchases at the fag-end of the 
week-end session and rose under the lead of Indus Motors, and Pak-Suzuki 
Motors.
    
Fauji Fertiliser was heavily traded in the chemical and pharma sector, 
finishing on-balance on the lower side and so did Engro Chemicals after 
early rise but Dawood Hercules, which is not a very active scrip rose 
appreciably.
    
Most of the MNCs in this section, notably Parke-Davis, BOC, Reckitt and 
Colman, and some others fell modestly.
    
PTC vouchers again proved the most active scrip after Hub-Power and 
traded both ways amid alternate bouts of buying and selling as investors 
were not inclined to take long positions. Telecard fell on late selling.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, firm 35 paisa on 
16.807m shares, followed by Hub-Power, higher 40 paisa on 14.141m 
shares, Fauji Fertiliser, lower 45 paisa on 1.340m shares, Lucky Cement, 
up 25 paisa on 0.771m shares and D.G.Khan Cement(r), unchanged on 1.905m 
shares.
    
Trading volume fell to 36.340m shares from the previous 52.915m shares 
owing to the absence of leading sellers.
    
There were 359 actives, out of which 179 shares suffered fall, while 107 
rose, with 73 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="thej">The judiciary triumphs-III</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

WADERASHAHI tactics, i.e. the intimidation and harassment of those who 
do not fall in line with executive wishes, have this time, so far, not 
worked. Despite heavy pressures, the judges of our Supreme Court, and 
their senior-most amicus, have not allowed themselves to be browbeaten 
into submission.
    
Neither did they allow dissension to be created in their ranks. They 
stood firm and the March 20 short order was delivered, as scheduled. 
(The full judgment came out on April 2.).
    
We have read in the Press the spate of words written by some of our 
retired judges, who have in the past held, or who now hold, government 
appointments, and by the government-inspired legal lights and bar 
associations (Larkana, for instance), who hold that the Supreme Court 
has jumped its mark and has acted unconstitutionally. The same has been 
said by the freely and fairly elected representatives sitting on the 
Treasury benches in the august and honourable Lower House. We can easily 
swallow all this with a smile.
    
Of more weight are the observations made by neutral outside observers. 
For instance, an editorial of March 28 in The Times of India, headed 
Landmark ruling:
    
Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, has reacted against the 
countrys Supreme Court landmark ruling that wrested judicial 
appointments from the exclusive control of the executive government. The 
Prime Minister has gone on record that the Court might have overstepped 
its power. The Supreme Court does not take away the prerogative of the 
President to appoint the judges but stipulates that the appointments 
must be based on judicial recommendations... The court has also ruled 
against the practice of appointing ad hoc judges.
    
While the court has not ruled out candidates for judgeships on account 
of their political affiliations, it has insisted on unimpeachable 
integrity, sound knowledge of law and recommendation of the concerned 
Chief Justice as preconditions for such appointments. This judgment has 
resulted in making the appointments of ad hoc judges unconstitutional. 
The judgment is a severe indictment of the way judicial appointments 
were made in Pakistan, especially by the Benazir Government. The 
cavalier attitude of the government towards the judiciary is exemplified 
by the confirmation of 17 ad hoc judges of the Lahore and Sindh High 
courts the day prior to the Supreme Court judgment, and these 
confirmations are likely to be impugned under the new ruling of the 
Supreme Court (this was done). The lawyers have threatened not to 
cooperate with the affected judges. The Pakistan Supreme Court has 
prescribed a crucial test for the democratic credentials of President 
Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The principles laid 
down by the Pakistan Supreme Court are unexceptionable. Not only the 
people of Pakistan but also all the inhabitants of South Asia will be 
interested in the assertion of judicial autonomy and independence in 
Pakistan.
    
Then, from The Economist (London) of March 23:
    
The judges of Pakistan are proving as feisty as those of India. 
Pakistans government is often accused of appointing judges because of 
their loyalty to the ruling party rather than their competence. But a 
judgment by the Supreme Court on March 20th removes from the government 
its exclusive power to make appointments to the higher courts. The Court 
said that such appointments have to have the consent of the chief 
justices of the high courts and the chief justice of Pakistan. It also 
insisted that new judges should have proper legal qualifications.
    
The court was ruling on a petition by a lawyer challenging the 
appointment of several judges to high courts last year by the prime 
minister, Benazir Bhutto. Apparently anticipating the ruling, Miss 
Bhutto had the previous day confirmed the permanent appointments of 17 
judges who had held their jobs in an ad hoc arrangement.
    
Some lawyers believe that, when the Supreme Courts full judgment is 
released, previous appointments made by Miss Bhutto may be struck down. 
The government claims all appointments have been made on merit. But the 
lawyer who brought the case is delighted. For the first time in 
Pakistans history, the judiciary is getting independent, he said.
    
Again from India, from one of her most eminent jurists, Fali Sam 
Nariman. To introduce him to those unfamiliar with his name: He was born 
in 1929, in Rangoon. He enrolled as an advocate of the Bombay High Court 
in 1950 and has been a senior advocate of the Supreme Court of India 
since 1971. From 1972 to 1975, he was the Additional Solicitor-General 
of India. He resigned from this post the day after Indira Gandhi 
declared her Emergency. In 1979 he became the Founder Chairman of the 
LAWASIA Standing Committee on Human Rights and during 1985-1987 was 
President of the Law Association for Asia and the Pacific.
    
Right now, he is President of the Bar Association of India, the 
President of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration, the 
Vice-Chairman of the International Court of Arbitration (Paris), a 
Member of the London Court of International Arbitration, Chairman of the 
Executive Committee of the International Commission of Jurists (Geneva), 
and a council member of the International Bar Association Human Rights 
Institute.
    
The message to us all from the President of the Indian Bar Association 
reads:
    
The order of March 20, 1996, of a Constitution Bench of the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan, presided over by its Chief Justice, has been welcomed 
by the entire fraternity of lawyers in India. The decision is in accord 
with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Independence of the 
Judiciary, which reaffirmed more than ten years ago that the judiciary 
shall have jurisdiction over all issues of a judicial nature and shall 
have exclusive authority to decide where an issue submitted for its 
decision is within its competence.
    
It is not without a struggle that successive governments of India have 
come to realise, and later accept, that an understanding of the 
provisions of a written constitution is not reached by a mere reading of 
them. For, as a former Chief Justice of the United States once said: We 
are under the Constitution but the Constitution is what the judges say 
it is.
    
Governments first begin to subvert a written Constitution when they 
undermine the authority by which they are constituted. On September 5, 
1970, when the Indian Constitution Twentyfourth (Amendment) Bill was 
defeated in Parliament, an attempt was made by the government of the day 
to overreach the verdict  by the issue on the same night of an 
Executive Order by the President. This Midnight Order, as it later came 
to be known, was struck down by a special eleven-member Bench of the 
Supreme Court of India. Since then, we have experienced several 
constitutional crises, but no Midnight Orders!
    
Our Constitution has survived because of the farsightedness of the 
justices of our apex court. We all hope and pray that your Constitution, 
enriched by the farsighted order of March 20, 1996, will survive all 
future onslaughts. With an independent judiciary in place the people of 
Pakistan have nothing to fear.
    
As far as we here are concerned, our most recent Midnight Order came 
on March 19. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah had announced on March 18 
that the Supreme Court would announce its short order in the Judges case 
on the morning of Wednesday, March 20. The worthies of our government 
then advised the President to issue orders on the evening of Tuesday, 
March 19:
    
... in exercise of the powers conferred by Article 193 of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the President is 
pleased to appoint the following Additional Judges of the High Court 
of... to be the Judges of the Court with immediate effect...
    
The notifications from the ministry of law, justice and parliamentary 
affairs were signed by the Secretary, Justice Muhammad Arif.
    
The 10 names listed for the Lahore High Court were Justices Rao Naeem 
Hashim Khan, Amir Alam Khan, M. Javaid Bhuttara, Miss Talat Yaqoob, 
Karamat Nazir Bhindari, M Asif Jan, Riaz Hussain, Sharif Hussain 
Bokhari, Nasira Javaid Iqbal, and Rana Muhammad Arshad Khan. The Lahore 
High Court was opened at night and these judges were sworn in by the 
Acting Chief Justice, Irshad Hasan Khan.
    
At 0830 on the morning of March 20, one hour before the Supreme Court 
was to sit, Justices Rasheed Ahmed Rizvi, Abdul Hameed Dogar, Amanullah 
Abassi, Ghous Muhammad, Hameed Ali Mirza, Shahanawaz Awan, and Agha 
Rafiq Ahmad Khan were sworn in the Sindh High Court by the Acting Chief 
Justice, Abdul Hafeez Memon.
    
The short order of 1100 hours on the 20th has invalidated all these 17 
appointments.
    
Our judiciary has asserted itself. Our judges now command more respect 
(and now less will be their need to demand it) by abusing the contempt 
of court jurisdiction which is very rarely used in advanced democratic 
countries. And, the thousands of political prisoners languishing in our 
jail now have more hope.

<a name="book">Book industry in the throes</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Zubeida Mustafa

HOW would one describe the state of the publishing industry in Pakistan 
today? Some feel that it has picked up, with a variety of books seeing 
the light of day. But others, especially those in this trade, are not so 
optimistic about its prospects and say the future of books in the 
country continues to be as grim as before, suffering as the industry 
does from utter neglect at the hands of the government.
    
The answer to the question, thus, would depend on how you look at the 
matter and what yardstick you use to measure success or failure. But 
there are no two opinions about the fact that the political climate has 
never been so good for book publishing as it is today. The advent of 
democracy has made it easier for writers to express their opinions 
freely and many historical events have been recorded which was not 
possible when the country was under military rule or an autocratic 
democracy. As a result there has been an upsurge in political writings 
which has been widely welcomed. But certain holy cows still have to be 
protected and publishers have to be wary about the sensitivity of 
different groups. Issues relating to religion, culture and even some 
historical personalities are deemed to be above criticism.
    
But if you were to evaluate the progress of the book industry in 
Pakistan in terms of the criteria generally employed, such as the number 
of titles published, the print run, the quality of the contents of 
publications and the affordability of books, a sorry picture emerges.
    
It is not any specific government which has hurt the publishing 
industry. Shams Quraeshi of Mackwin, the doyen of the book trade in 
Pakistan, has lamented the pathetic treatment traditionally meted out to 
his profession in this country since its inception.
    
It is not just those striding in the corridors of power who do not care. 
This indifference permeates all levels. Recently, we had a painful 
demonstration of this lack of concern for the publishers. At the 
launching of a book on the Quaid-i-Azam where the prime minister was the 
chief guest, the publisher was pointedly ignored. The author did not 
even acknowledge his publishers (OUP) services. As for Ms Bhutto, she 
chose to take no notice of what the managing director of the OUP had to 
say in her speech a few minutes earlier. Ameena Saiyid, the OUPs head 
in Pakistan, had in vain tried to draw the attention of those in office 
to some of the problems the book industry has been facing.
    
The step-motherly attitude vis-a-vis books adopted by the government has 
received reinforcement from public apathy. Of course the dismally low 
literacy rate of 36 per cent (not all of the so-called literates are 
capable of reading a book) is one factor responsible for the poverty of 
our book world. But the literacy rate would not have been so low if the 
successive governments had cared more for knowledge and learning which 
are enshrined in books. The failure to boost literacy and book 
publishing is symptomatic of the same malaise.
    
The two major problems that the OUP chief in Pakistan highlighted but 
which fell on deaf ears are two sides of the same coin. One is the very 
high cost of book production which makes all publications so 
prohibitively expensive. The other is piracy which denies the publisher 
and the author their rightful earnings from the sale of their products.
    
Small wonder, the growth of the book industry is so badly stunted in 
Pakistan. At the most 2000 titles are published every year with a 
maximum print run of a thousand copies. In India on an average 15,000 
titles hit the stands every year and the print runs, at least for 
popular fiction, are much higher than in Pakistan. A popular Hindi novel 
is said to have reached a record of 500,000 copies in print recently. 
Popular writers in Pakistan such as Mushtaq Ahmed Yusufi are lucky when 
their books have 3,000 copies printed.
    
Shams Quraeshi very rightly points out that the difference in the size 
of the populations of the two countries and thus the potential market 
size does not account for this disparity. Had it been so, the print run 
of a popular Urdu novel in Pakistan should have still been about 50,000. 
Since it is not, there is something seriously wrong somewhere.
    
This disparity is underscored in UNESCOs World Education Report which 
gives the data for the printing and writing paper consumed in the two 
countries. While India uses 1861 kg paper per 1000 people, in Pakistan 
the corresponding figure is only 1297.
    
The governments negative approach is best reflected in the economics of 
book production, which lies at the heart of the problem. It is now 
commonplace for even modestly sized books to be priced at Rs 200 or so. 
The small print run of course works against the economy of scales. But 
even otherwise the government has not been overly helpful. For instance, 
paper accounts for about 70 per cent of the production cost of a book. 
With the price of paper having jumped up nearly four times in the last 
ten years, book publishing is by no means a low cost business.
    
With no indigenous production of paper worth the name in the country, 
publishers have had to depend on imported material. Instead of 
recognising the predicament of the book trade the government has 
proceeded to give it a crippling blow in the form of an injudicious tax 
structure. The import duty of 55 per cent on paper at once raises its 
price for all other levies, be it the sales tax of 15 per cent, income 
tax of four per cent, Iqra of five per cent, and the Regulatory Duty of 
13 per cent.
    
When the end product of the publishing industry is so frightfully 
expensive, the scope for piracy naturally knows no bounds. By not being 
required to invest in overheads, pay any taxes to the government or 
royalty to the author, the pirate can produce books which are cheaper. 
Therefore they sell more easily and his profit margin is bigger.
    
Piracy can undermine the publishing industry badly. The recent 
tightening of the copyright law which has enhanced the punishment and 
made it possible to nab the wrongdoers has not caused much relief 
either. A case can drag on in the court for years and the publisher 
could end up spending more than what he loses because of piracy. The 
most effective strategy to combat piracy would be to reduce the price of 
books so that there is not much margin for an artificial cut in price. 
But given the governments taxation structure, the publisher cannot 
lower the price of books any further.
    
The small market  ensured by the low literacy rate and the poor reading 
habits of people which have been made worse by television  does not 
help publishers boost their sales. In other countries, a conventional 
outlet for the book trade has been a vast library network. This has 
woefully been lacking in Pakistan. There are about 1200 libraries in the 
country with less than 10 million books. This is a very small number for 
a population of 140 million.
    
Moreover, these libraries do not have a sizable budget for the purchase 
of books. At one time the university libraries were spending only half 
their budget on books. The college libraries have a smaller book budget. 
No comprehensive statistics are available to assess the share of the 
library purchases in the book trade in Pakistan. But it is definitely 
not too impressive.
    
The government has not adopted any concerted policy of book promotion 
either. For instance, no funds are made available to subsidise 
publishing so that low cost books are made available to the people who 
might then be encouraged to buy and read them. This is specially true 
for serious books such as reference works, encyclopaedias, research 
publications and science books. They are costly to produce and can 
hardly be done profitably by a publisher. That would explain why the 
bulk of the books produced comprise Urdu poetry, collections of so-
called literary articles, religious discourses and impressionistic 
writings giving the opinions of writers but containing no information or 
data.
    
Shams Quraeshi points out wistfully that the Indian government spends 
millions  Rs 400 millions or so  on the promotion of 15 regional 
languages and Hindi. Paper is subsidised for books and calculated 
measures are adopted to keep prices down.
    
Textbooks, which have been described as the bread and butter of any book 
industry because of the large sales assured, have been virtually the 
governments monopoly in Pakistan since the sixties when the Textbook 
Boards were set up. Book publishing suffered a grievous blow because 
textbooks, potentially the most paying product of a publisher, were not 
allowed to be produced in the private sector.
    
Mercifully the situation is changing somewhat. The government has on an 
experimental basis tried to involve private publishers in textbook 
production. Last year it invited publishers to submit samples of 
textbooks for seven specified subjects for four classes. Although 64 
publishers were registered, only eight or so actually offered samples 
and five were selected.
    
But they will again be required to compete with the Textbook Boards on 
an unequal footing. Since the publishers will have to purchase duty-free 
paper from the Boards but pay a royalty on it or buy paper from the open 
market on which import duty has been levied. Ameena Saiyyid says that 
this boosts the price of the OUP textbooks two-fold as compared with the 
Boards publications.
    
The issue which ultimately emerges as the key one is whether the 
government is prepared to heed the voice of the publishers. The tendency 
has so far been to ignore them. This has not helped. If knowledge and 
research is to be promoted in this country, our approach to the book 
world will have to change.

<a name="nota">Not a drop to drink</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mushtaq Ahmad

IT IS atrocious that in this God-given country of snow-fed rivers, lakes 
and mountain springs, one has to spend as much as Rs. 1,200 a week for 
domestic consumption of water. In the higher income brackets people have 
a much higher price to pay and they pay it without compunction and 
complaint. For, money flows into their coffers the way water used to 
flow once into our tanks.
    
I cannot help being bitterly critical because I cannot afford to foot 
such a fabulous bill, although I am certain that there must be hundreds 
of thousands who must be more painfully deprived. I can at least 
ventilate my grievance. The large majority must bear the agony in 
silence if it does not have the will and the power to openly protest 
against this cruel deprivation.
    
The much maligned anarchist school of thought, now almost extinct, was 
maliciously blamed for propagating the cult of anarchy. Its adherents 
were incomparably more humanistic and humane than the present breed of 
politicians who are utterly insensitive to the pains and privations of 
the deprived and the disadvantaged. It was their commitment that if they 
ever came to power they would make bread free like water. Now the tables 
have been turned. If we have to spend all that money on water, not much 
would be left to buy the bread.
    
Water, as defined in elementary textbooks on economics, has utility but 
no value except in conditions of scarcity. In a land of plenty its 
scarcity is inexcusable. The explanations offered for the increasingly 
frequent breakdowns and failures in water supply can hardly satisfy any 
one, much less reassure the harassed and harried public. Sometimes it is 
the shortage in dry seasons resulting from excessive evaporation. At 
other times it is due to a breach in the canals and water courses. 
Shortage is also caused by the bursting of the concrete pipelines 
apparently made of substandard material. Announcement through Press 
releases that in certain areas supply would be suspended for four days 
or a week is considered an adequate ground to relieve them of their 
responsibility, by the concerned functionaries without making an 
alternative provision even for a basic minimum of availability. It is a 
strange phenomenon that even while it rains pipes go dry, reminding one 
of the famous rhyme: Water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink.
    
The water tax of our municipal and local authorities, unlike other taxes 
imposed by the provincial and central governments, is related to a 
specific service for whose failure they are legally accountable, and its 
consumers justifiably entitled to compensation. It is a duty they cannot 
evade without making themselves liable for legal action and even penalty 
for non- fulfilment. This relationship has a universal application in 
law and practice. Under extraordinary circumstances the supplying agency 
may rationalise or ration the distribution of water but not deny 
accessibility to it without inviting conditions of anarchy and chaos. 
For, while men can live without gems and jewellery, they cannot survive 
without water. A regular supply of water at the cheapest possible rate 
is a dire necessity of existence and its cessation the surest sign of 
trouble and turbulence.
    
The extent of shortage people are inclined to believe is often 
artificial and intentionally created. One can see it from the 
overspilling tankers that ply on the roads from daylight to sunset. They 
have strong reasons to suspect that between the management and the tank 
operators there is a conspiracy to defraud them. To that suspicion the 
price of water supplied by tankers lends plausible credence. Water is 
bought from hydrants at Rs 20 for two hundred gallons and sold to the 
consumers at Rs 125 to Rs 250 under the inexorable law of supply and 
demand. Each tanker makes roughly twenty trips a day and some of them 
even more. From the operations of 4,000 of them on the roads, one can 
well imagine the high profitability of the business. The collusion among 
the parties has converted what is an essential service into a money-
making scandal, against which public criticism goes unheeded.
    
The representatives of the people at the local and provincial levels 
appear least bothered. If they do not have to face the problem 
themselves, they think the masses can have no cause for grievance. The 
ghost of Marie Antoinette still seems to haunt their luxury abodes which 
are no less luxurious than the palaces of the kings and emperors. In the 
context of their non-chalant and casual attitude, her ill- informed 
advice to the people of eighteenth century France is worth recalling: 
If they cant get bread, why dont they eat cakes? Our politicians 
might turn round and say; If they cannot get water, why dont they take 
soft drinks? Not very long ago, they had asked them to eat apples if 
potatoes were not available for their daily diet, and then ordered 
several thousand tons of them to be imported from India which were 
allowed to rot at the border after payment for the consignment had been 
made from the treasury in hard currency.
    
There is something basically wrong with the management of water 
distribution in Karachi. Instead of improvement, we have witnessed a 
progressive deterioration in its supply. For mismanagement a host of 
reasons are responsible. Inefficiency and corruption, lack of planning 
and co-ordination, feverish building activity that has converted a city 
of small houses into a metropolis of high-rises, and, above all, a 
ceaseless drift of the population from the interior are among the major 
contributory factors. The essential services have consequently come 
under severe strains, water being the most indispensable among them. 
Officials and clerks and even valve men, at the bottom rung, look upon 
it as a business proposition in which bribery and corruption abound 
and where service is a casual consideration and not an act of necessity, 
which, in any case, is handsomely paid for.
    
Yet, the consumer is treated as if he is not a customer but the 
recipient of a favour. His plight is obvious from the energy consumed in 
running after the private supplier. The administration is heedless to 
the complaints about non-supply or erratic supply, but is exacting in 
the realisation of charges which he must pay or else risk his water 
connection being cut off, whether or not water is in the pipeline.
    
Residents are often told that there would be no water for a week or so 
and that alternative arrangements for its procurement should be made. Of 
such an alternative source no indication is given. Perhaps it is the 
fleecing tanker operators they have in mind. Their prohibitive price tag 
is enough to deflate a hardpressed customer, who must cut down his 
expenses elsewhere to meet the extortionate demand of the supplier. At 
this rate, we might well face a situation of anarchy in a state where 
order and progress are supposedly among the top priorities of the 
governments, whose spokesmen proclaim from housetops day in and day out 
that the provision of basic necessities of life is their legal and moral 
obligation from which they would not resile. What we are witnessing, 
however, is the very opposite of what is promised as peoples basic 
right.
    
Solutions to the chronic problem of water shortage afflicting urban 
centres like Karachi are there but they have not been tapped seriously 
and systematically enough. For instance, the Indus flood water that 
flows into the sea in unlimited quantities every year is so much life-
sustaining substance wasted through lack of planning. If conserved 
through building storage capacities, it can enormously supplement the 
available resources in the dry season. Mini-dams and small lakes built 
upstream and downstream at suitable locations can meet recurring 
shortages that continually plague the lives of millions in Karachi. The 
50 square mile Keenjar Lake, seventy miles from Karachi, created in the 
early years of Pakistan is a shining example of bold planning and 
dedicated efforts which unfortunately was not followed in the subsequent 
period. Or else there would have been plentiful supplies of water to 
meet the rapidly growing demand of Karachi and other cities of Sindh. 
Had the government been conscious of their responsibilities, we would 
have had by now nearly half a dozen supplementary reservoirs to ensure 
an abundant and uninteruppted supply of water to this beleaguered city. 
Provision of water is a fundamental duty of the government, which it can 
ignore only at the risk of forfeiting its mandate to rule.

<a name="newe">New enterprising vocations</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hafizur Rahman

MAYBE it is a sign of progress that more and more people every day are 
taking to larceny, dacoity and the occasional murder as a wholetime 
vocation.
    
At this rate the time may soon come when families which have no son 
engaged in any of these activities will have to hide themselves for 
shame. People of the new respectability will shun them as pariahs, and 
they will feel that they are perhaps the lowest that one can get in such 
an advanced society.
    
It is heartening to note that the intellectual level of persons engaged 
in larceny and dacoity (and the occasional murder of course) is also 
gradually rising. It is no longer the field for those rejected by 
society  the riff raff and the good-for- nothings who couldnt think of 
anything better to do.
    
Gone are the days when a man involved in these activities wore a guilty 
look and was looked down upon by the genteel and the noble even if they 
were poor. He would rather have died than admitted his nefarious 
profession. Happily it is no longer so.
    
In Sindh it is said that half the jungle dacoits are graduates. In 
Punjab nothing could have done more to impart respectability to these 
enterprising vocations than what happened some time ago in Multan, the 
city of saints. (Apparently the saintly part of the population is all 
below ground level).
    
It was discovered by the Multan police that a group of four lawyers had 
been masterminding dacoities and other such work. The four were also 
alleged to have killed a companion who, they believed, had ratted on 
them, and thrown his dead body in a nearby forest.
    
They might have been justified in that because he was only a student of 
B.A. Lawyers are men of law. In a way they are the biggest opponents of 
crime and criminals. With lawyers joining the most popular profession, 
its ranks will be greatly strengthened. It is like important MNAs 
deserting the government and teaming up with the opposition.
    
This incursion of lawyers into the crime business is not going to be 
without its repercussions. It is true that lawyers are always the first 
everywhere, but do you think the other professions are going to take it 
complacently? I am sure they have already started watering at the mouth.
    
I shouldnt be surprised if the really forward-looking among doctors 
(for example) have not become jealous enough to decide on a change of 
profession  a change for the better. Apart from dacoity they should do 
well in murder. Ill tell you why.
   
The Multan lawyers were found out when they killed their young companion 
and threw his body in the forest. They couldnt ascribe his death to 
such Latin phrases as Corum non judice or Mutatis mutandis. On the other 
hand, doctors wanting to get rid of a snake in the grass, a traitor to 
the cause, have only to say that he died of a new virus called veritas 
fornicatis or due to excess of antiphlogistine, or some such name which 
nobody understands, and the body will be given a decent burial.
    
And if someone does shout Murder! afterwards, and the body has to be 
exhumed for post-mortem examination, who will conduct the autopsy? You 
are right. The very same doctors or their friends.
    
Would engineers want to be left behind in the race for crime? How can 
they when they are otherwise the foremost in making money on the side? 
They will benefit from the fact that they have long practice in that 
art. The very day they enter a job they start their work. In fact their 
old parents would die of disappointment if they werent able to buy a 
car (or get one from a contractor) within a month of their sons 
appointment. And engineers are somehow so altruistic that if you dont 
pay them their salary they wont mind in the least.
    
In fact they are so obsessed by the thought of public works that they 
just want to build and build and go on building. They construct a road 
one day and reconstruct it again after three months, as if they were not 
satisfied with their own work. Same with public buildings like schools 
and hospitals. Absolute perfectionists they are.
    
Also they are conscious of the fact that going to all this trouble 
provides employment to hundreds, and sometimes thousands of labourers  
right in the Moghul tradition. What attitude they are going to adopt 
after becoming real dacoits (and committing the occasional murder) I 
cannot say.
    
School and college teachers are usually slow to react. For example, very 
few among them are able to realise that they are there to teach. By the 
time this realisation sinks in, they are too old to do anything about 
it.
    
But if the teachers decide to go the lawyers way it will be for 
understandable reasons. Their emoluments are so meagre, and 
opportunities for Fazl-i-Rabbi  overhead income  so few, that actually 
they should have been the first to take to larceny, dacoity (and the 
occasional murder too if needed).
    
You see, doctors and lawyers and engineers are already termed as dacoits 
by unthinking people, although Im sure they dont do anything to 
deserve that appellation. At least I have never been held up at pistol 
point by anyone belonging to either of the three groups.
    
The poor teacher, on the other hand, has always had a raw deal at the 
hands of the public, who, instead of being grateful to him for keeping 
their children away from the harmful effects of modern education, treat 
him as something the cat had brought home. If anyone deserves a change 
of profession it is the teacher.
    
And do you think maulvis and pirs are going to be left behind when 
everybody else is forging ahead? Certainly not. But let me keep them for 
some other day. Theyll need a whole column to themselves.

<a name="thep">The parwanas of democracy</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

TODAY politics in Pakistan is identified with reference to Quaid-i-
Awam. On one hand are lovers (parwanas in Urdu) of Bhutto, while on the 
other his opponents. His lovers want democracy... his opponents support 
dictatorship...
    
PM Bhutto speaking in Garhi Khuda Baksh on the death anniversary of 
Quaid-i-Awam, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
    
Imagine my depression and gloom after reading this statement because 
according to it I find myself in the camp of the supporters of 
dictatorship. In its all-embracing sweep, this declaration does not say 
that you have to actively or intellectually sympathise with fascism in 
order to qualify as a supporter of dictatorship. If you are not one of 
Bhuttos parwanas you are of the devils party and hence automatically 
cast beyond the pale of redemption.
    
My own position is especially parlous because there was a time when, if 
not exactly a parwana of the Quaid-i-Awam, I was at least a minor flag-
bearer in the revolutionary caravan whose leadership had by then 
devolved, according to the iron laws of heritage which continue to hold 
sway in the sub-continent, on the shoulders of his daughter. Since this 
is confession time let me say that my enthusiasm for the cause at the 
time was no less great than that of any other runner with his eye on the 
future who was trying to keep up with Ms Bhuttos Pajero (the Pajero 
then being the undisputed symbol of upward political mobility in the 
Republic). But such being my fickle nature, or call it my wayward 
energy, by the time the Daughter of the East had settled into the Prime 
Ministers house (during her first incarnation, that is) my enthusiasm 
had begun to wane. Seeing the leaders of the people at close quarters 
had cured me of the desire for upward political mobility (temporarily I 
must hasten to add because for the germ of political ambition there is 
no lasting remedy).
    
Those of my friends who are not given to looking kindly at me or my 
endeavours say that I was miffed because I was denied a party ticket for 
the 1988 elections. I myself tend to favour an explanation that lies in 
this quote from Eugene ONeill: You asked why I quit the Movement. I 
had a lot of good reasons. One was myself, and another was my 
comrades... For myself I was forced to admit, at the end of thirty 
years devotion to the Cause, that I was never made for it... As history 
proves, to be a worldly success at anything, especially revolution, you 
have to wear blinders like a horse and see only straight in front of 
you. You have to see, too, that this is all black, and that is all 
white. As for my comrades in the Great Cause, I felt as Horace Walpole 
did about England, that he could love it if it werent for the people in 
it.
    
Seeing the camp fires of revolution from close quarters had cured me of 
most of my illusions. Even so, the formal act of excommunication was 
performed by Ms Bhutto herself. Somewhere in the middle of 1989, at a 
meeting with senior columnists (a breed which, as far as I can tell, 
exists only in Pakistan) things became a bit hot when the conversation 
turned to Mr Hakim Ali Zardari. Trying to act as a fireman, Mushahid 
Hussain (who till then was still a senior columnist) said with a smile 
to Ms Bhutto that she should not be upset with me because I was a member 
of her party. Not any more, was the instant and imperious answer.
    
Why I recount this is to explain that much as I may want, to be a Bhutto 
lover and hence counted as a supporter of democracy, I am condemned to 
be in purgatory along with all the other supporters of dictatorship 
having been excommunicated from the ranks of the faithful by the leader 
herself. Since then a lot of water may have flowed down the rivers of 
Pakistan but distance in this case is of no comfort because if you are 
not a parwana of Bhutto you become, in Ms Bhuttos own words, a 
supporter of dictatorship. Salvation or perdition. Like in heaven there 
is no middle ground in Ms Bhuttos theology.
    
But if more than half the country stands condemned by this definition, 
is it not instructive to take a look at those who remain as the 
champions of democracy?
    
Any such list has to be headed by the two governors doing yeoman service 
in Punjab and Balochistan: Lt. Gen. Raja Saroop and Lt. Gen. Imranullah 
Khan. Both attained high military rank under General Zia-ul-Haq but for 
all we know either they must have been part of a secret cell working 
against the dictator or, alternatively, they must have been closet 
Bhutto parwanas, their secret yearning known only to Ms Benazir Bhutto. 
Sindhs formidable governor, Kamal Azfar, is an interesting example of 
someone who remained a Bhutto lover, and hence a lover of democracy, 
despite a series of amazing U-turns which found him first in the company 
of Maulana Kausar Niazi when he formed his Progressive Peoples Party and 
later in that of Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi when he formed his National 
Peoples Party. (The Maulana having departed into the eternal shades, it 
would be churlish to ask about his party, but where has the NPP gone?) 
Anyway, Kamal Azfars heart must obviously have remained in the right 
place because after his various forays into the wilderness he is back 
where he belongs: among the supporters of democracy.
    
In Islamabad the list of leading Bhutto lovers is long and 
distinguished. It includes Pillar of the Regime and Soul of a Poet (Ms 
Bhuttos own title), Shahid Hasan Khan, whose pro- democracy role in the 
Zia years is such a closely guarded secret that it is known only to the 
Prime Minister; Keeper of the Royal Seals, Sir Ahmed Falstaff Sadiq, who 
as it now transpires was always a jiala; my friend Naveed Malik whose 
occasional pro-Zia statements back in the eighties were a cover for his 
PPP activities; Culture Symbol Raana Sheikh who despite being a Foreign 
Office wife did underground work, of a vaguely dangerous kind, for 
democracy; and the Lodhi clan, now heavily into the defence of Pakistan, 
whose members went without food for days when Mr Bhutto was hanged.
    
The PPP has always had a gift for polarisation. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto may 
never have said idhar hum, udhar tum (a headline actually concocted by 
the journalist Abbas Athar) but the course that he adopted after the 
1970 elections  refusing to acknowledge the Awami Leagues title to 
power despite its having won a clear majority in the National Assembly  
amounted to saying just that. Benazir Bhutto now says that those who are 
parwanas of Bhutto are lovers of democracy. Everyone else is a supporter 
of dictatorship and obscurantism. In this diktat whatever else there may 
be, there is not much of humility.
    
The problem, however, is slightly more complicated than Ms Bhutto 
thinks. How does someone actually prove that he is a Bhutto-lover? The 
most active spirits who took part in the struggle against Zia are 
largely forgotten. There were PPP men who set fire to themselves in 1978 
as part of the disjointed effort to stave off the hanging of Bhutto. 
Misguided activists who took to the paths of violence against the Zia 
regime were tortured before being sentenced to long terms in prison. A 
few of them were sent to the gallows. Does any one even remember their 
names?
    
Not that the PPP has been alone in using its workers as cannon fodder. 
In all the political movements which have sprung up from the soil of 
Pakistan a sharp distinction has always been drawn between those meant 
to bear the brunt of the lathis and those destined to taste the rewards 
of success. Who remembers the martyrs of the PNA movement? Do Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan, Maulana Abdus Sattar Niazi and Maulana Fazlur Rehman 
remember the names of those five people who were shot by the police when 
in 1989 these luminaries led a demonstration in Islamabad against Salman 
Rushdies Satanic Verses? Does Altaf Hussain really care about the 
lengthening list of the dead in Karachi? But the PPP is supposed to be 
different because is it not the party of the people?
    
These grim thoughts, however, are best left aside. It is more cheerful 
to keep in mind the patience and perseverance of those PPP leaders (my 
friendship with most of them preventing me from taking their names) who 
have turned the cult of mediocrity and the bearing of insults into 
closely-entwined art forms. From the garden of the PPPs second coming 
these canny souls have picked the choicest fruits. Need anyone be 
surprised, therefore, if in Ms Bhuttos view of the world they also 
qualify as the leading lovers of democracy?</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="amet">A metamorphosis in cricket culture</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
John F. Burns

When Englishmen introduced cricket to the Indian subcontinent they 
brought more than a game.
    
Along with white trousers and games that lasted for days, the English 
grafted an entire culture into the consciousness  and the language  of 
those they ruled.
    
Nearly 50 years after the British Empire faded into history, people in 
this region still say, "It's not cricket," meaning something is not 
fair. Saying that somebody "plays with a straight bat," in business or 
politics, signals integrity. A "sticky wicket" means conditions that are 
disagreeable. And so on.
    
But in the past month, all across the region, cricket's inherited 
culture has come under challenge.
    
The World Cup, played in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, has shown that 
cricket, enveloped in distinctly un-English passions on and off the 
field, has changed so much that old-timers might say cricket itself is 
"not cricket" anymore.
    
When the final was played in Lahore with Sri Lanka scoring an upset 
victory over Australia, the organisers could look back on a month of 
turmoil. For the first time in the 20 years the championship has been 
staged, one game  a semifinal between India and Sri Lanka in Calcutta 
had to be abandoned because of crowd violence that threatened the 
players.
    
As glass bottles were hurled onto the field and fires burned in the 
stands, Sri Lanka's players, on the verge of victory anyway, were 
escorted from the field by police commandos with bulletproof jackets and 
submachine guns.
    
The incident set off an outburst of self-recrimination. Headlines in 
Indian newspapers proclaimed "Shame!" Calcutta businessmen placed front-
page advertisements to apologise to Sri Lanka: "Sorry, gentlemen. It was 
just not cricket at Eden Gardens," referring to the 110,000-seat stadium 
in Calcutta "It will not happen again."
    
Ashoke Mitra, a columnist, wrote in The Telegraph of Calcutta, "Cricket 
is civilisation: India, let us have the grace to admit, we're yet to 
attain that level of civility."
    
The emotions were a somersault from days earlier, when India beat 
Pakistan in a quarterfinal at Bangalore. As the Indian crowds danced in 
the stands, an Indian television commentator gloated at the victory 
"over our old enemies  er, rivals."
    
Indian headlines, three inches deep on the front pages, announced 
"Victory!" Some commentators urged Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to 
call a coming general election without delay, to profit from the 
"bounce" that victory over Pakistan would give the ruling Congress (I) 
Party.
    
The loss pitched Pakistan into despair. In the city of Mardan, a college 
student fired a burst with a Kalashnikov rifle into a television set, 
then shot himself dead; similar suicides in India followed India's 
Calcutta defeat. In Pakistan's Parliament, legislators called for the 
arrest of Pakistan's captain, Wasim Akram, on suspicion of throwing the 
India game for bribes.
    
On the field, as off, the championship made clear that the game has 
migrated, and metamorphosed. As if to underline the point, the English 
team departed the championship early, humiliated in a quarterfinal by 
Sri Lanka, a team that English overlords of the game kept out of top-
level cricket until a few years ago. The defeat prompted Denis Silk, 
whose position as chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board makes 
him England's equivalent of the baseball commissioner, to say, "If our 
team keeps going the way it has been going, then our game will die."
    
Scandals have become commonplace. The Australians recently accused the 
Pakistan team of attempting to bribe them and the Sri Lankans of ball-
tampering.
    
This gave an added edge to World Cup final. So did Australia's decision, 
earlier in the championship, to boycott a game against Sri Lanka in 
Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital after a terrorist truck bomb exploded in 
Colombo's financial district in February, killing nearly 90 people.
    
But when reporters asked Arjuna Ranatunga, the Sri Lankan captain, if 
final would be a grudge match for Sri Lanka, he reverted to the game's 
traditions. "Revenge is a word that has no place in cricket,'" he said.

<a name="lift">Pakistan lift Cup in Singapore</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

SINGAPORE, April 7: Pakistan staged a sensational turnaround on Sunday 
to win the Singer Cup after being hammered by Sri Lankan opener Sanath 
Jayasuriya for the quickest half-century in one-day cricket.
    
Chasing a modest 216 on the Padang grounds, World Cup champions Sri 
Lanka collapsed for 172 in 32.5 overs after appearing set for victory 
when Jayasuriya, who five days ago struck the quickest hundred, was in 
full flow.
    
Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq and medium-pacer Ata-ur-Rehman shared six 
wickets, and Waqar Younis and Aaqib Javed grabbed the remaining four to 
bowl Pakistan to a brilliant victory for the 30,000 US dollar first 
prize.
    
Sri Lankas chances of adding the Singer Cup to the World Cup they won 
last month disappeared when their top order collapsed after Jayasuriyas 
dismissal.
    
I had the feeling that once we got Jayasuriya, it would not be too 
difficult, said Pakistan skipper Aamir Sohail. It was a collective 
team effort.
    
Jayasuriya, who had Tuesday taken the quickest hundred in a one-day 
international against the same team, rewrote the record books again by 
reaching a half-century off just 17 balls.
    
His fifty, which contained five sixes and four fours, was quicker by a 
ball than Australian all-rounder Simon ODonnells effort against New 
Zealand in 1990.
    
The balding 27-year-old left-hander, who showed no respect for any 
bowler, was eventually out for a magnificent 76 off just 27 balls when 
he looked on course for smashing his Tuesdays record for the quickest 
ton.
    
There were five sixes and eight fours, each beautifully timed and 
powerfully struck, before he skied an easy catch to Saeed Anwar at extra 
cover off fast-bowler Waqar Younis.
    
Jayasuriyas dismissal with the score at 96 saw a sensational collapse 
as four wickets fell for the addition of 10 runs.
    
Earlier, Pakistan were bowled out for a modest 215 in 48.3 overs after 
being asked to bat first by Sri Lanka, who lined up the same side that 
beat Australia in the World Cup final.
    
None of the batsmen stayed long enough in the middle to play a big 
innings against a nagging attack that gave nothing away and was backed 
by splendid fielding that made Pakistan fight for every run.
    
Ijaz Ahmed top-scored with 51 off 75 balls, inclusive of two huge sixes 
near the end, before becoming the last batsman to fall when he was clean 
bowled by Sanath Jayasuriya, trying a mighty heave.

<a name="aami">Aamir Sohail happy; has no claims to captaincy</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Special Representative

SINGAPORE, April 7: A happy and smiling Aamir Sohail said that he would 
hand over the captaincy to Wasim Akram because it was he who was the 
best man for the job.
    
Talking to journalists after the match, Sohail said: When Wasim 
recovers from the injury and makes himself available, he will be the 
captain. But what I have learnt from this experience will be available 
to Wasim and even the team.
    
Sohail said until Wasim Akram was playing, he has no chance of taking 
the leadership. Wasim is the right man. He is a match-winner and a born 
leader. I will only think of becoming a permanent captain when Wasim 
decides to hand his boots.
    
Sohail, replying to a question, said he was in no position to make any 
claims with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB). If I have won a 
tournament, that doesnt mean I have claims to become a permanent 
captain. I still have to learn and perform. Moreover, it is the board 
which has the right to appoint captain. Players have no say in that.
    
Aamir Sohail has leadership qualities. The way he has handled the team 
and that for the first time in his career, its really appreciable. As 
far as Wasim Akram is concerned, well thats up to the board to decide 
how is the most suitable man for the captains job, Intikhab Alam 
commented.
    
The aggressive skipper said he was optimistic about win when Pakistan 
collected 215 runs. I knew that the wicket was getting worse. Even when 
Jayasuriya was whipping us, I knew that he would play a bad shot and 
will throw away his wicket.
    
All we were waiting was for Jayasuriya to make mistake and he did 
because he was getting after every ball. One cannot hit  all the balls. 
After that what happened, you all know, he said.
    
Sohail was all praise for Waqar Younis, Aqib Javed, Ataur Rahman and 
Saqlain Mushtaq. I had faith in them because they have delivered the 
goods quite often and in difficult stages. I am glad they lived up to my 
expectations.

<a name="saql">Saqlain Mushtaq confirms his promise</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

LAHORE,April 8:Promising off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq finally proved his 
mettle by winning his first Man of the Match award in guiding Pakistan 
to success in the Singers Cup.
    
The 18-year-old youngster emphasised his talent with three for 46 from 
42 balls and was promptly praised by his captain Aamir Sohail as the 
best off-spinner in the game .
    
Saqlain who finished the three-nation tournament with eight wickets for 
129 runs began his cricketing career at the age of 15 years by 
representing Lahore in the national Under-19 tournament in the 1992-93 
season.
    
He then went onto represent Combined Universities in the Patrons Grade 
II Trophy in the 1993-94 season where his performance was noted and this 
led to his selection against the visiting New Zealand Youth team.
    
Twice during the 1994-95 winter he was chosen to tour Bangladesh with 
Pakistan A for the SAARC Gold Cup and then to New Zealand with the 
Pakistan youth side.
    
Saqlain claimed 52 wickets at 18.23 runs apiece in his initial season 
and finished ninth in the final first class averages.
    
The youngster went to New Zealand as vice-captain of Pakistan Youth side 
and his best efforts was seven for 70 in the second Test at Hamilton.
    
His continued improvement finally earned him a place in the national 
senior team during the one-day series against Sri Lanka at home last 
October.
    
On the subsequent trip to Sharjah, Saqlain earned his best one-day 
figures of four for 47 against the West Indies and also scored his 
highest score of 30 against Sri Lanka.

<a name="hayn">Haynes quits first class cricket</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KINGSTON, (St Vincent), April 6: Desmond Haynes, the illustrious former 
Barbados and West Indies opening batsman, formally announced his 
retirement from international cricket.

The 40-year-old Haynes informed the West Indies Cricket Board of Control 
(WICBC) of his decision in a fax sent through Sussex County Cricket Club 
in England, where he has been appointed coach for the next three years.
    
In making this decision, I have taken a number of factors into 
consideration, not least of which is the need to move on to a new phase 
in my life while seeking to provide for the future well-being of my 
family, Haynes wrote.
    
He added: May I take this opportunity to say thank you publicly to the 
Barbados Cricket Association and the WICBC and to express my 
appreciation to these bodies for affording me the great honour of 
representing my country and the Caribbean as a professional crickeer for 
the 16-year period from 1978 to 1994.
    
Haynes, whose career ended contentiously in 1995, wished West Indies 
cricket success in the future and once more offered himself to serve the 
people of the Caribbean.
    
In offering his support to Tony Marshall, the new manager Clive Lloyd, 
his former West Indies captain and the teams new coach, along with 
Courtney Walsh, the new captain, Haynes said: I hope that this is the 
start of a successful rebuilding process which is greatly desired by all 
persons who are interested in seeing West Indian cricket live up to the 
potential of its players and resume its former glory.
    
He continued: It is my earnest desire that I will be given an 
opportunity to contribute in some meaningful way to cricket in the 
Caribbean at some time in the future.

<a name="inth">Pakistan in the right groove in Sharjah</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Viren Varma

SHARJAH, April 10: Pakistan, to some extent, have atoned for what they 
termed a "disaster" against India in the World Cup, by winning the 
recent triangular in Singapore, comfortably edging out their old nemesis 
on run rate en route to the final.
    
So their victory - over India, in particular - must have eased the 
pressure from an oversentimental home crowd. And now they are looking 
forward to another good run in the Sharjah Cup which gets under way at 
the Sharjah Stadium tomorrow.
    
The Pakistanis are relieved a lot now under stand-in skipper Aamir 
Sohail, who almost overnight was hailed as a "cool-headed" skipper after 
his deft handling of the team in the dramatic Singapore final against 
world champions, Sri Lanka.
    
Well, at the moment, it might be a little premature to say that the once 
temperamental Sohail poses a serious threat to Wasim Akram, but then you 
never know, it's cricket and that too Pakistan cricket where captains 
are known to live dangerously.
    
"I have already made it very, very clear that I am not harbouring any 
such ambitions. At present, I am captaining the side simply because 
Wasim has been advised rest by the doctors. Even talking about the 
subject is ridiculous," Sohail told Khaleej Times yesterday.
    
"I wouldn't say the team is relieved after the victory in Singapore.
    
`Confident and happy' is the correct expression. With the Singapore win 
we have got into the right groove and hope to continue in the same vein.

<a name="jans">Jansher wins 5th British Open title in a row</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dicky Rutnagur

CARDIFF, April 8: All talk about Jansher Khan, the world champion having 
come underprepared to defend his title in the British Open 
Championships, was stilled by the manner in which he won his final, 15-
13, 15-8, 15-10, in 50 minutes, against the World number two, Rodney 
Eyles, of Australia.
    
The achievement was the greater for the fact that Eyles himself played 
with great inspiration, keeping his errors to a minimum. Even when 
tired, he was not wanting for fight, but it was only in the first game 
that he posed a positive threat.
    
It was a long game of 19 minutes, the Australian moving briskly round 
the court and playing incisive shots. A factor that hindered Jansher was 
the referees strictness in making sure that Jansher moved clear of the 
ball after playing his drop shots. Quite a few penalty points were 
awarded against him.
    
Eyless resolve showed in the manner in which he neutralised Janshers 
7-5 lead to himself go 8-7 up and then stay level with him until 13, at 
which point Jansher played a fantastic backhand drop. The winning point 
came from Eyles hitting down with a backhand drive intended to be a 
killer.</pre>
