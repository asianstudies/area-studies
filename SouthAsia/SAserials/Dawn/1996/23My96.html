<a name="vajp">Vajpayee sworn in as premier</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Umashanker Phadnis

NEW DELHI, May 16: The leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party, Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee, was sworn in as the tenth prime minister of India with a compact 
ten-member cabinet for the time being.
    
In choosing the members of his government, Mr Vajpayee has to tread the 
ground carefully at any rate till he is able to test out his strength in 
the house. Hence, in the initial round he has been cautious not to include 
too many hot heads which would be setting out signals of an aggressive 
government he heads. At the same time, he has had to bear in mind that he 
does not offend the radicals among the rank and file of his party and in 
its ally, the Shiv Sena, who have been waiting for this moment of triumph 
of their Hindutwa war cry.
    
Thus, represented in his council of ministers is Murali Manohar Joshi, the 
former president of the party who had played the cheer leaders role in the 
run down to the events leading to Babri Masjid demolition. Mr Vajpayee has 
balanced this by including Mr. Jaswant Singh, a former army major from 
Rajasthan who is known for his sober approach and also for the rapport he 
was with Mr Vajpayee. He has also had considerable administrative and 
parliamentary experience and Mr Vajpayee will pay heed to his views and 
assessment of specific situations.
    
The council of ministers has also a balanced composition of various straits 
of society and represented in it are the scheduled tribes and castes as 
well as those of the other backward castes. One reason why Mr Vajpayee has 
currently kept the council of ministers a small one may well be the scope 
he needs for expanding it to accommodate some of the BJP allies, namely, 
the Shiv Sena, the Shiromani Akali Dal, the Samata Party and if necessary 
the others who might join the coalition to provide the government with a 
stable majority.
    
Mr Vajpayee appears to have excluded studiously in his council of 
ministers, Jag Mohan, the fire eating former governor of Jammu and Kashmir 
although he was a favourite with rank and file of the party for the ultra-
chauvinistic line he has been projecting on the Kashmir issue. Nor has Mr 
Vajpayee taken in any of the prominent hard-liners like Sundar Singh 
Bhandari who were in the reckoning in party circles.
    
With the sword of Democles hanging over him, Mr Vajpayee has been 
projecting the human face of Hindutwa, assuring minorities of a square deal 
although he has made it clear that the central thrust of his government 
would be the implementation of the commitments made to the electorate in 
the partys manifesto. He has made it clear that the temple would be 
constructed at the disputed site at Ayodhya but has said this would be done 
through a process of negotiations and talks with all concerned.

<a name="bjpg">BJP govt no threat to Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

LAHORE, May 18: Every government in India, irrespective of its party 
affiliation, has been hostile to Pakistan and so is true about the new BJP 
government, Defence Minister Aftab Shahban Mirani said.

He dispelled the impression that the danger to Pakistans security had 
increased after the installation of the BJP government in India. Pakistan 
has a very strong defence and we are fully aware of developments across the 
border, the minister said
    
However, Mr Mirani said, since Pakistan had a long border with India and 
there was turmoil and confusion in Afghanistan, Pakistan had to be fully 
vigilant. He said there was no question of a reduction in the defence 
budget unless the level of danger came down.
    
To a query, the defence minister said Pakistan was fully aware that India 
had deployed mobile missiles near the border. But, he said, We know how 
to respond to the situation.

<a name="alte">AI team arrives to assess HR situation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
  
KARACHI, May 17: A three-member Amnesty International (AI) delegation, led 
by its Deputy secretary-general Here Berber, arrived here on a week-long 
tour.
    
The delegation would hold meetings with various government officials and 
seek their opinion on some controversial issues pertaining to the alleged 
human rights abuses in Pakistan.
    
Two months back, a Pakistani delegate at a human rights forum in Geneva had 
announced that his government was committed to abolish all forms of 
slavery, including the bonded labours, he added.
    
Mr Berber said: The AI has a limited scope as it deals with cases of 
political prisoners. However, it usually exerts pressure through the UN on 
countries for provision of basic needs to their citizens.
    
In Pakistan, he said, the delegation would hold meetings with the GO 
community, politicians and journalists to seek their opinion on the human 
rights situation in the country.
    
The delegation, he said, would also visit homes of those who had reportedly 
been killed in police encounters, lock-ups and police custody.

<a name="corr">Corruption, rights situation in Pakistan upset US</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaken Serbia

WASHINGTON, May 22: The US state department has expressed concern over 
some recent trends in Pakistan, including corruption and the human rights 
situation, and stated that US efforts to strengthen relations with Pakistan 
were based on a number of important considerations but are not a specific 
endorsement of any particular Pakistani government.
    
These views have been conveyed to Democratic congressman James P. Morn, who 
had written a letter to the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, in 
March, raising concerns about corruption and other domestic issues in 
Pakistan.
    
In a reply sent on May 1 to Rep. Morn, on behalf of the secretary of state 
by a senior state department official, Barbara Lark, stated: Pakistan is a 
large, democratic, moderate Islamic state located in a dangerous and 
strategically important part of the world. To meet US national goals in 
South Asia (e.g. non-proliferation, regional stability, protection of human 
rights, counter-terrorism and narcotics control), the United States must 
remain closely engaged with Pakistan. 
   
The Brown Amendment provides the US government with new tools with which to 
build closer ties.
    
Like you, we are troubled by some recent trends in Pakistan. As elsewhere 
in South Asia, corruption saps economic vitality and slows economic growth. 
As documented in our annual country reports on human rights practices, the 
human rights situation (in Pakistan) is worrisome. We remain concerned 
about proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in South Asia. 
   
But our best hope for making progress in each of these areas is to continue 
our dialogue with Pakistan.
    
I hope this information is useful to you. If you have any further 
questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
    
Rep Morn, a known supporter of Pakistan on the Hill and president of the 
Pakistan Day celebrations committee, had in his letter stated that the 
level of corruption in Pakistan had increased and become even more 
pervasive.
    
He had also referred to the religious radicalisation in Pakistan, gross 
human rights violations and exploitation of children as well as the rush 
to develop nuclear capability.
    
He had requested the state department to state the official policy on all 
these issues.

<a name="ngos">NGOs concerned over govt move</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 21: Some noted non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have 
scheduled a meeting with the Secretary, Social Welfare, Sindh, Amities 
Barakzai, to discuss the government actions which have created a scare 
among social welfare organisations throughout the province.
    
The NGO representative said the majority of the social bodies did not know 
at all whether they had to submit an annual audit report to the department.
    
However, the secretary was of the view that the government had done nothing 
in contravention of the set rules and those bodies had been issued notices 
who were violating the rules laid down at the time of their registration.
    
He said any organisation getting registration had to provide an undertaking 
that it would always follow the guidelines, which also included submission 
of annual and audit reports.
    
According to him, there are over 250 social bodies in interior Sindh and 
over 300 in Karachi which are untraceable.
    
He said the social welfare department was fully prepared to extend the NGOs 
the help they needed for their interaction with other government 
departments.
    
However, he made it clear that no NGO would go scot-free if it did not 
provide the department with the audit and annual reports.
    
The NGOs have shown their concern in the wake of reports that the 
department has been setting up inquiry committees to initiate disciplinary 
actions against social welfare bodies which have not submitted a single 
annual report of their accounts ever since they were registered.

According to the sources, the issuance of the notices is the first step 
towards de-registering all those organisations which are not maintaining 
their accounts properly and are not making appropriate utilisation of the 
funds they receive from the government or the donor agencies.

<a name="govt">Govt, MQM hopeful of breakthrough after talks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamimur Rahman

KARACHI, May 20: In dramatic moves MQM and the government held another 
direct, though informal, talks during which both sides expressed their 
desire for a negotiated and peaceful solution to the problems of Karachi 
and other parts of Sindh.
    
The MQM delegation which met Sindh Governor Kamal Azfar, was led by its 
chief negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi and included the deputy opposition leader in 
the Sindh assembly, Shoaib Bokhari.
    
After the talks the governor was quoted by official sources as having said 
no impediments be placed on the agenda and the talks be started 
unconditionally as soon as possible in order to build confidence and 
strengthen the ground conditions for the continuation of peace in Karachi.
    
Before the talks, the PPP secretary general, Sheikh Rafiq Ahmed, also held 
discussions with the governor on the prevailing political situation in 
general and the relationship with the MQM in particular.
    
This second informal contact between the government and the MQM in less 
than four days is being seen by observers here as part of the quiet 
diplomacy by the principal actors to remove the irritants before a formal 
dialogue.

Briefing newsmen at an unscheduled news conference at Karachi Press Club 
shortly after the talks at the Governor House, Mr Dehlavi said the prime 
objective of the meeting was not only to discuss the resumption of talks, 
but also to appraise the governor of alleged extrajudical killings and the 
administrations policy of obstructing collection and disposal of hides and 
skins and the siege of the MQMs Khidmat-i-Khalq committee.
    
Whenever some progress is made for the restoration of peace and normality, 
some hidden forces go into action to sabotage the process, he said without 
identifying these elements.
    
He said the governor had promised to take up with the federal government 
the MQMs complaints about the alleged extrajudicial killings as well as 
its preconditions for the resumption of negotiations besides removal of its 
grievances with regard to collection and disposal of hides and skins of 
sacrificial animals.

<a name="over">Over half KMC parks annual budget spent on wall </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar R. Quraishi

KARACHI, May 20: More than half the KMCs budget for developing the citys 
parks and playgrounds has been spent on constructing a wall at the Bagh 
Ibne Qasim park in Clifton, it is reliably learnt.
    
A high-level KMC source said that the annual budget of the KMCs Parks 
department was Rs 60 million. Out of this, he said, Rs 32.8 million had 
been set aside to pay for constructing this wall at the Clifton park.

There are around 2000 parks and playgrounds in Karachi. Out of these 
seventy per cent or close 1400 are parks. Not more than 700 of these parks 
are fully developed, the source said.
    
Fully developed means that there is at least a chowkidar and a gardener to 
look after the park, and that water and electricity supplies are assured. 
If you dont sanction staff and funds to develop a park it will die like a 
hospital with no doctors would, he said.
    
The largest city park is the 400-acre Safari Park near Karachi University. 
Most of the others are smaller with areas going down to half an acre.

The KMC Parks department, the source said, is seriously thinking of 
advising the government that if the parks budget is not increased, at least 
participation by the private sector should be encouraged.
    
The government should introduce something like an adopt-a-park scheme you 
find in other countries. Multinational corporations or philanthropists 
should be targeted by the government for this, the source said.

<a name="dmcs">DMCs likely to begin working in July</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Saghir Ahmed

KARACHI, May 22: Except for the formal concurrence of Sindh Chief Minister 
Syed Abdullah Shah, all is now set for the functioning of the five newly-
created district municipal corporations from July 1  the beginning of the 
new financial year  informed sources said.
    
The tax-sharing formula between the KMC and the DMCs, finalised by the 
government committee on resource distribution, has already been sent to the 
chief minister for his consent by the secretary of the local government 
department, Nur Ahmad.
    
Sources said the KMC finance department has begun preparation of statements 
of receipts and expenditure, i.e. the budget estimates for the KMC and 
draft budgets for five district municipal corporations (DMCs)  East, West, 
Central, South and Malir  year 1996-97, on the basis of the tax-sharing 
formula, anticipating approval of the recommendations by the Chief 
Minister.

The committee, in its recommendations, has urged the government to notify 
the Unified Municipal Service Board (as provided in the Act) so that the 
question of service matters relating to seniority, promotion, transfer, 
posting and other benefits are dealt with jointly by the board, avoiding 
anomalies which were experienced during the period of the defunct ZMCs.
    
Meanwhile, it is also learnt that the said committee is still engaged in 
the work of distribution of assets and liabilities between the KMC and the 
DMCs, including transfer of staff, equipment, movable and immovable 
property, etc.
    
Inquiries show that as per the recommendations regarding revenue sharing, 
it has kept five taxes in the KMCs divisible pool i.e. octroi, fire, 
conservancy, drainage and slaughtering fee, providing collection of octroi 
and slaughtering fee by the KMC whereas fire and conservancy taxes by the 
KWSB as per existing practice.
    
The KWSB will, however, transfer the collected amount on these counts to 
the KMC after deducting service charges at the rate of 15 per cent.
    
As to the newly introduced drainage tax, the committee has recommended that 
the KMCs newly-elected council may decide its future i.e. its rate and 
time of its levy. The committee has declared advertisement tax, trade and 
licence fee, property tax, betterment tax, vehicle tax would be the DMC 
taxes which would be collected directly.

It has suggested that all the eight development schemes under the Karachi 
Package (costing Rs 284.50 million) should be executed by the KMC, 
irrespective of any consideration of districts in which work is proceeding.

The PMs Karachi Package includes widening of Lasbella Bridge, Liaquatabad 
flyover, construction of Clifton flyover, Lilly Road Bridge, link road 
between Tin Hatti and Shaheed-i-Millat Road, storm-water drain in Manzoor 
Colony, construction of truck stand at Hawkesbay and special development 
projects  Rashid Minhas Road flyover, Sharea Faisal overhead bridge and 
overpass at Christians Cemetery.

<a name="body">Body soon to probe existence of private jails, says minister</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From Our Correspondent

MIRPURKHAS, May 17: Federal minister for agriculture and food, Nawab Yousuf 
Talpur, has said that committees comprising peasants, representatives of 
human rights committee, landlords and journalists, would be set up at 
district level in Sindh to investigate into the existence of any private 
jail and to solve the problems of peasants and landlords.
    
Speaking at a Press conference at the circuit house here, he said the 
foreign Press was busy in propaganda about the private jail of landlords. 
For jails have a boundary wall, cells and locks, but these were missing and 
hence these cannot be called jails, and advised the landlords should not be 
disturbed. However, he said ,stern action would be taken against those 
landlords who had private jails.

<a name="usto">US to clear citizenship cases backlog by November</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From Our Staff Correspondent
   
WASHINGTON, May 20: The Clinton Administration has announced it would clear 
the backlog of hundreds of thousands of applications for US citizenship 
before the November presidential polls this year.
    
Announcing the initiative, vice-president Al Gore said the process 
strengthens the nation and is one which the Administration wholeheartedly 
supports.
    
Reports said on Monday hundreds of government servants from other 
departments were being transferred by the Administration to the Immigration 
and Naturalisation Service (INS) to help complete the job.
    
Applications for US citizenship have increased manifold after Congress 
began discussing new anti-immigration laws and fears grew in the immigrant 
community that many privileges they now enjoy may be withdrawn.
    
After the new curbs on immigrants were revealed in Californias Proposition 
187, designed to deny social services to illegal immigrants, figures show 
the number of citizenship applications doubled in volume.
    
In fiscal 1995, more than one million people applied for US citizenship  
nearly twice as many as in 1994  and the INS was able to process only 
about half of them. In March this year the backlog was close to 900,000 
applications, figures revealed.
    
The INS has asked other federal agencies, specially in Los Angeles, San 
Francisco, Miami, Chicago and New York, to detail their employees in the 
INS to clear the backlog which accounts for 75 per cent of the applications 
nation-wide, a report in Washington Times said.

<a name="rupe">Rupee sheds 35 paisa more against dollar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Aslam

KARACHI, May 22: The rupee shed another 35 paisa on the open market on 
Wednesday, breaching the psychological barrier of Rs38 to a dollar as 
rumours of an imminent official devaluation of the rupee triggered panic 
buying for the US currency.
    
In late evening, the dollar was traded as high as Rs38.25 but it was in a 
terrible short supply.
    
The rupee has fallen by seven per cent in kerb dealings during the last 
about two weeks or Rs2.60 to a dollar and Rs4 since July 1,1995, currency 
dealers said adding: The spread of Rs3.16 between the official and the 
kerb rates gives much-needed leverage to speculative traders.
    
The spot buying and selling rates were quoted at Rs38.05 and Rs38.08 as 
compared to Tuesdays Rs37.70 and Rs37.75 in kerb dealings but official 
spot rates were held unchanged at Rs34.75 and Rs34.92 respectively.
    
However, central bank officials were least worried over the virtual turmoil 
in the open currency market and an unprecedented squeeze on the US dollar 
telling investors that in a free market anything could happen at the risks 
of speculative traders.
    
According to one estimate dollar worth about Rs8bn have been purchased 
during the last about one week and despite a steady inflow from the 
neighbouring markets, the dollar is in short supply.
    
Strong demand from Islamabad dealers has generated a good bit of local 
speculative buying as signals from the capital mean some special 
significance for the currency dealers, financial analysts said.

The US dollar is now worth Rs38.08 for selling and the rumoured target of 
Rs40 might not now be a distant possibility, said a leading currency 
dealer.

<a name="blan">Blanket GST not possible, IMF told</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 22: The five-month-old 600 million dollar IMF Standby 
Arrangement scheduled to conclude in March 1997 is in serious jeopardy, as 
the government, during on-going negotiations with the IMF, is reported to 
have expressed its inability to levy General Sales Tax (GST) across the 
board in the next budget.
    
Informed sources said that the visiting IMF mission headed by its Regional 
Director  Andre Hovaguimian, again held wide-ranging talks with Pakistani 
officials and called for implementing various conditionalities attached to 
the 600 million dollar Standby Loan.
    
The Pakistani negotiating team is headed by V. A. Jafarey, the Prime 
Ministers Advisor on Finance and Economic Affairs. 
    
The government side is said to have refused to levy GST at any stage on 
food, fertilisers and medicines, and for the next year it has consented to 
withdraw GST exemptions from a limited number of other items. Also, it has 
asked the Fund to allow extension of full GST coverage up to the retail 
stage in a phased manner over the next three years.
    
But the IMF, sources said, believes that without imposing GST across the 
board in the budget for 1996-97, the present revenue crisis could not be 
overcome and the process of documentation would be delayed unnecessarily.
    
The issue of achieving 4 per cent GDP budget deficit target for the next 
fiscal year was another hot topic of discussion, with Pakistani authorities 
trying to convince the IMF not to insist on the issue.
    
Mr V.A.Jafarey conveyed to them that the 4 per cent deficit target would 
mean imposition of at least Rs 50 billion of additional taxes on the one 
hand and slowing down of the economy to a snails pace on the other, which 
would cause serious stagflation.
    
Officials of the Ministry of Finance were privately airing their views 
about the possible reaction among the masses over both, imposition of the 
GST and 4 per cent GDP budget deficit target, in case they were 
scrupulously implemented in the next budget.
    
The impact of the taxation related to 4 per cent budget deficit was also 
discussed with the IMF and it was informed that the government would have 
to go for massive taxation to implement what is being termed a real hard 
task for the government.

<a name="faci">Govt facing difficulties in meeting IMF terms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 17: Pakistan is facing difficulties in implementing the 
conditionalities of the IMF in the next budget and the government has 
decided to arrange meetings between the Fund officials and the political 
representatives to ease out pressure from the Washington based 
organisation.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the visiting IMF mission met here with 
State Minister for Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin and insisted that 
conditionalities relating to budget deficit, tariffs and monetary expansion 
should be implemented, failing which Pakistan would not be able to qualify 
for third tranche of 600 million dollars standby loan.
    
However, the mission was told that there was a duly elected political 
government in Pakistan which has to take into account lot of political 
considerations while implementing various fiscal policies and that it 
could not blindly accept IMF conditionalities.
    
A number of meetings will be arranged between the MNAs of both the 
government and the opposition with the visiting IMF mission with a view to 
convince it to be lenient towards Pakistan.
    
He told Dawn that the IMF conditionalities were aimed at implementing 
structural reform programme with a view to improving socio-economic 
conditions of common man.

Pakistan has agreed with the IMF that conditionalities like 4 per cent GDP 
budget deficit, reducing of tariff to 55 per cent and achieving 8 per cent 
rate of inflation will be achieved during 1996-97.
    
Sources said that Pakistan has made it clear to the IMF that it was unable 
to reduce its defence budget keeping in view the security situation in the 
region. The IMF said that it was also asking India to reduce its defence 
budget and that the Fund was treating both the countries at par on the 
issue.

<a name="huge">Huge govt borrowing weakens rupee</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, May 22: The excessive government borrowing from banking channels 
is one of the factors behind the increase in money supply that in turn is 
weakening the rupee. The trend can hardly be reversed without the 
government slashing its borrowings.
    
Money market analysts link the recent huge depreciation in rupee value in 
the kerb market to an unusual increase in the money supply that the State 
Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has managed to contain only partially because of 
excessive government borrowing.

The SBP Board of Directors that met on Tuesday at Islamabad asked the 
government to cut down its borrowing that is believed to have touched Rs 74 
billion mark  more than double the Credit Plan limit of Rs 30 billion 
projected for the entire fiscal year 1995-96.
    
In the kerb market, rupee lost 35 paisa against dollar on Wednesday and 23 
paisa on Tuesday and market analysts fear the fall may continue.
    
Although foreign exchange dealers say an official devaluation of rupee is 
imminent yet senior bankers and money market analysts think otherwise.

Since the October 29 huge devaluation of 7.0 per cent that came in one go 
the SBP has made several downward revision in the value of rupee calling 
them corrective adjustments.

Money market analysts say the money borrowed by the government finds it way 
back into the system in the form of various government payments. This 
vicious circle is hard to break.

<a name="stat">State Bank projects monetary expansion at 13-14 per cent</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 21: The Board of Directors of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) 
asked the government on Tuesday to cut down its bank borrowing that is in 
excess of the 1995-96 credit plan target. It also approved a tentative 
credit plan for 1996-97 targeting to keep monetary expansion at 13-14 per 
cent.
    
The government bank borrowing stood at Rs 66 billion by mid April  more 
than double the targeted Rs 28.1 billion for the entire fiscal year 1995/ 
96 that ends on June 30.
    
Containment of government borrowing is very vital for enforcing financial 
and monetary discipline and as such more than 100 per cent increase in the 
borrowing limit has to be taken serious by the central bank. The SBP 
release did not specify the 1996-97 target for bank borrowing.
    
The government borrowing for budgetary support had bypassed the 1994-95 
target of Rs 15 billion by a wide margin of Rs 12 billion as the figure 
stood at Rs 27 billion by the end of that fiscal year.
    
The 1995-96 Credit Plan envisaged Rs 64.0 billion limit for credit to the 
private sector. Till mid-April the credit to the private sector stood at 
52.6 billion. Finance managers of the country feel the figure was well 
within limits and the target would not be surpassed.

Bureau Report

LAHORE, May 19: A leading American telecom concern, GTE, is reported to 
have contacted the Privatisation Commission officials in Islamabad, this 
week to discuss prospects to purchase Pakistan Telecommunication 
Corporation shares. Reliable sources said that top officials of the GTE 
dashed to Islamabad a few days ago and held detailed interrogation about 
the PTCs current financial outlook and future viability, in case 
corporations 26 per cent holding was sold to the private sector. 
   
It is understood that the GTE is trying to make a syndicate with a German 
concern, which has been operating in Pakistan for the last three decades, 
to evaluate matters pertaining to PTCs privatisation. The PTC officials 
confirmed the GTE officials visit to Pakistan in connection with the 
corporations privatisation, and added that in fact the visitors also 
called on the PTC officials. Sources said that cash-rich US company was 
eagerly looking forward to making massive investment in Pakistan in 
different sectors, and the telecommunication is one such area in which it 
would initially do some business. It is understood that cash reserve of the 
American company stands at $8 billion at present.

<a name="expe">Expert opinion sought on trade with India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 21: The government has decided to formally take up the issue 
of bilateral trade with India and is seeking expert opinion from a group of 
local and foreign consultants, it is learnt.
    
The ministry of commerce as well as other economic ministries are said to 
have given the go-ahead to open trade with India, saying that it would not 
harm the political or economic interests of Pakistan.
    
Internal exercises conducted especially by the ministry of commerce 
suggested that the matter should not be delayed for a very long time.
    
The businessmen of Punjab, particularly those of Lahore, the ministry 
officials claim, are eager to have trade with India as early as possible 
and that is why have established initial contracts with their counterparts 
in various places across the border, including New Delhi, Jalandher, 
Amritsar, Luddhiana and Hariana.
    
The representatives of trade bodies and officials of the ministry of 
commerce are believed to have rejected the point of view of the 
intelligence agencies that trade with India would hurt Pakistans 
interests. The ministry has also rejected the objections of Pakistans 
ambassador in Delhi, Riaz Khokhar, terming them as being without substance 
or logic.
    
Commerce Minister Chauhdary Ahmad Mukhtar, too, sees no harm and he is 
confident that Pakistan could beat India almost in every department of 
trade and industry. India, despite being so big, produces cotton which is 
almost equal to Pakistans level and similarly does no have any substantial 
edge on us in any particular field, he maintains.

The government has also asked the experts group to advise it on the 
question of granting the status of Most Favoured Nation India which it had 
already offered to Pakistan. Here, too, we cannot linger on the issue for 
a very long time as it is against the rules of World Trade Organisation 
(WTO), Mr Mukhtar said. He pointed out that the issue was first discussed 
during the late Gen Ziaul Haqs period and was decided in principle by the 
government of Nawaz Sharif.

<a name="isla">Islamic Equity Fund launched in Britain</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From Athar Ali

LONDON, May 20: Flemings, one of the largest UK-based international 
investment banks, which set up a world-wide Islamic equity fund in March 
this year, has now launched it in Britain for the benefit of more than 2 
million Muslims living in the country. 
   
The worldwide response, said Mr Shane ORiordin, a Flemings spokesman, has 
already yielded $7 million investment. It is expected that the fund could 
bring in US$ 100-150 million internationally. The UK market is expected to 
result in $5-10 million investment.
    
The fund is to be called Oasis and is to be supervised by a board of 
Islamic scholars, including Mr Justice Taqqi al-Usmani, former member of 
the Sharia Appellate Bench of the Pakistan Supreme Court who is currently 
vice-chairman of Dar-ul-Uloom, Karachi. The other two members are Dr Abdul 
Sattar Abu Gaddah and Dr Nazih Hammad, both associated with the Jeddah-
based Islamic Fiqh Academy. 
   
These Muslim scholars will supervise the investment made by the equity fund 
and see that it conforms to the correct Islamic tenets with regard to 
interest-free financial dealings. 

At $9.63 per share, the fund will be open to investment with a minimum of 
$50,000. Mr ORiordin said that Flemings felt there was big equity market 
in which Muslim investors had a very small share. 
   
They have launched the fund in the hope that it will grow. Flemings have 
started investing in over 80 companies which were found to be Islamically 
correct. 
   
These include pharmaceuticals and electronic firms. Some names such as 
Roche (Swiss), Emerson Electronics (US), Myers Squibb (US) and Cable and 
Wireless are worth mentioning.
    
The companies in which the fund will invest will be chosen so as to find 
approval with the committee of experts. 
  
Companies deriving income from gambling, distribution or sale of alcohol 
and partaking in promiscuity will not be chosen. 
  
Oasis, the Islamic equity fund, is incorporated in Luxembourg and its 
shares are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Initial subscriptions 
will be accepted at the Net Asset Value per share plus an initial charge of 
5% which will be reduced for larger orders.

<a name="stoc">Stocks show fresh decline on panic selling</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, May 16: Stocks showed fresh sharp decline on renewed hasty selling 
prompted by news of nomination of Atal Behari Vajpayee of BJP as the new 
prime minister of India.
    
What seemed to have triggered panic selling was his statements on the Azad 
Kashmir and nuclear issues.

The opening was distinctly easy as the index was about 50 points down and 
there were fears in some quarters that the Vajpayee factor could trigger 
fresh sellstops but institutional traders came to the rescue of the market 
and it managed to recover about 12 points till the final bell.
    
However, in the process it lost seven billion and 14 billion during the 
last two sessions as the market capitalisation fell to Rs 371 bn.
    
The KSE 100-share index breached the 1,700-point barrier and was last 
quoted at 1,698.06 as compared to 1,735.45 a day earlier, reflecting the 
relative weakness of the base shares.
    
Opinions about the direction of the market are now divided as the 
leadership change in India could well mean a confrontation. Militants in 
the BJP might not like to ease tension between the two countries after 
Vajpayee managed to secure vote of confidence from the house.

Minus signs, therefore, dominated the scene, although losses in most cases 
were fractional and reflected lack of support rather than large selling.
    
Most of the indexed shares, however, remained under pressure and took the 
entire market along with them in the minus column, notable losers among 
them being ICP SEMF, Adamjee Insurance, Dewan Salman, Shell Pakistan and 
Engro Chemicals, which suffered fall ranging from Rs 3 to 3.50.
    
Other prominent losers were led by National Fibre, Wellcome Pakistan, 
Pakland Cement, Citicorp, Faysal Bank, Askari Bank, Indus Motors and Pak-
Suzuki Motors, but falls were modest.
    
Some of the leading shares managed to put on fresh good gains under the 
lead of Lever Brothers and Rafhan Maize Products, , which rose by Rs 5 each 
followed by Central Insurance, Friends Spinning, MCB, Dawood Hercules, 
Quality Steel, and Mitchells Fruits, rising by one rupee to Rs 1.75.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, off Rs 1.70 on 13.071m 
shares on heavy weekend selling but there were buyers at the dips followed 
by Hub-Power, lower one rupee on 8.712m shares, Dhan Fibre, easy 55 paisa 
on 3.469m shares, Dewan Salman, sharply lower by Rs 4.50 on 1.739m shares 
and FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, easy 35 paisa on 1.232m shares. Lucky Cement was 
also actively traded, off Rs 1.35 on a million shares.
    
Other actives were led by Faysal Bank, off Rs 1.40 on 0.507m shares, ICI 
Pakistan, down one rupee on 0.485m shares, LTV Modaraba, lower 10 paisa on 
0.450m shares, and Sui Southern, easy Rs 1.25 on 0.293m shares.
    
Trading volume rose further to 35.047m shares from the previous 34.817m 
shares as most of the current favourites were actively traded both ways.
    
There were 292 actives, out of 206 shares fell, while 40 rose, with 46 
holding on to the last levels.
    
Dividend: The board of directors of Exide Pakistan has announced a cash 
dividend at the rate of 25 per cent for the year ended March 31, 1996, 
while Askari General Insurance Company and Arju Garments Accessories have 
omitted the dividend for their last financial years.

<a name="mark">Stock market remains under pressure</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, May 22: Stocks remained under pressure as the new account buying 
failed to figure prominently on any of the blue chip counters.
    
Turmoil in the free money market after a steep decline in the value of the 
rupee against the US dollar at Rs 38.08 for selling was the central point 
of discussion among the leading brokers.
    
There might have been stray selling to buy the dollar but its evidence in 
the rings was not immediately confirmed by any of the leading dealers.

The rupee might not be officially devalued as the last massive devaluation 
of about 10 per cent failed to boost exports, but the market now is in the 
tight grip of speculative forces and they are manipulating to their own 
advantage, they added.
    
It was perhaps in this background the index lost another about 18 points at 
1,685.97, making the total during the last two sessions to about 40 points, 
which means a market capitalisation loss of about Rs 9 billion at Rs 368 
bn.
    
The KSE 100-share index was last quoted at 1,685.97 as compared to 
1,703.56, breaching the 1,700 points after about a week.
    
Floor brokers said the near-term direction of the market is uncertain as 
investors are not inclined to make fresh commitments even at the falling 
prices.
    
What has unnerved them is heavy selling in most of the pivotals under the 
lead of PTC vouchers and Hub-Power, which have prompted a good bit of 
sympathetic selling from other quarters.

Minus signs, therefore, again dominated the list but losses in most of the 
cases were fractional and reflected lack of large selling from some of the 
big dealers.
    
However, some of the local blue chips, which had risen sharply over the 
last few weeks came in for active selling and were quoted lower by Rs 3.40 
to 5 for Dewan Salman, Gharibwal Cement and EFU.
    
Other prominent losers were led by Askari Leasing, Atlas Leasing, Atlas 
Bank, Adamjee Insurance, Abbott Lab, Fauji Fertiliser, Highnoon Lab and 
Parke-Davis, falling by one rupee to Rs 1.50.
    
Some of the leading shares managed to finish modestly higher on active 
short-covering under the lead of Al-Abid Silk, Quality Steel, and Dawood 
Hercules, rising by Rs 2 to 3.
    
They were followed by ICP SEM, Polypropylene, and Quice Foods, but the 
biggest gain of Rs 11 was noted in Ideal Energy, which remained in strong 
demand apparently from the management.
    
The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, sharply lower by Rs 
1.75 on 13.745m shares followed by Hub-Power, lower 20 paisa on 5.525m 
shares, Dhan Fibre, easy 20 paisa on 2.00 m shares, Dewan Salman, off Rs 
3.40 on 1.748m shares, and FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, of 95 paisa on 0.833m 
shares.
    
Other actives were led by Faysal Bank, easy 50 paisa on 0.436m shares, 
Lucky Cement, off 30 paisa on 0.559m shares, Quice Foods, up Rs 1.25 on 
0.404m shares, and LTV Modaraba, unchanged on 0.163m shares. There were 
some other actives also.
    
Trading volume fell to 28.872m shares from the previous 34.307 m shares 
owing to the absence of leading sellers.
    
There were 328 actives, out of which 211 shares fell, while 58 rose, with 
59 holding on to the last levels.
    
A dividend news from the Orient Insurance was disappointing as its 
directors have omitted the dividend for the last year. While others have 
came out with good announcements under the lead of Adamjee and EFU 
Insurance during the last three sessions and there were rumours that others 
might follow suit.

<a name="them">The man of a hundred faces</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

 WHAT is the derivative of the name Saroop? I asked of another General. 
Its misspelt, I was told, it should be Sao (meaning a hundred) roop 
(faces). But, then, whats in a name?
    
In October 1993, before the loyalists could completely devour and demolish 
the samosas and tea that was served to those who had graced the second 
swearing-in of Benazir as prime minister, she left with her nearest and 
dearest hangers-on to fly to Peshawar to topple the Sabir Shah provincial 
government and ensure the installation of acolyte Aftab Sherpao.
    
This accomplished, Raja Saroop Khan, a former Lieutenant-General of the 
Pakistan Army, chairman of the newly formed Committee for Research and 
Analysis (COMREAN) set up in the Prime Ministers Secretariat, targeted 
Punjab. The Raja produced a Strategy Paper. It opens:
    
Since the last meeting convened by the Prime Minister to discuss strategy 
regarding Punjab, a lot of water has passed under the bridge. The strategy 
requires to be reviewed as the contours of the political scenery have 
undergone certain changes. The current situation is as under:
    
(i) The PPP is no longer locked in a stalemate in the NWFP. The federal 
government can now concentrate its energies and attention on Punjab. The 
bold manner in which the government has leapt over the political and 
judicial hurdles in the NWFP would definitely serve to discipline its 
coalition partner in Punjab.
    
It continued: The PPP relations with Manzoor Wattoo have moved from the 
stage of total mistrust to muted suspicion... Wattoo has effortlessly 
stripped Makhdoom altaf off the writ of the post of senior minister 
established by Faisal Saleh Hayat... as a direct consequence thereof even 
minor issues cannot be resolved locally and all problems are transferred 
upwards to be settled at the level of the Prime Minister and President. 
This is an undesirable state of affairs as the highest pillars of the state 
structure, the PM/President, are losing their awe due to over-exposure.
    
Wrote Saroop, the induction of Chaudhry Altaf Hussain as Governor of Punjab 
had provided a much needed power centre to the PPP but that his position 
needed to be strengthened by giving him effective powers over Wattoo, 
whose insecurities continue to condition his behaviour even now... 
demolishes this bulwark too.
    
The Objective follows:
    
In spite of the facts that Manzoor Wattoo has started masquerading as 
playing ball with us and we have also succeeded in distancing him from Mian 
Nawaz Sharif, our objective of ditching him should not be altered. Our real 
enemy lurks within our gates, as Mian Manzoor Wattoo has damaged the PPP 
more than its enemies General Zia-ul-Haq and Nawaz Sharif. He has snatched 
pride and hope from the partys workers. In case Wattoo continues in power, 
the PPP would be slow-poisoned to political demise. The PPPs political 
survivial depends upon Albatrosss removal.
    
Then, the Strategy:
    
Redefining of Roles... Our main shortcoming is that we have so far not 
been able to put our act together. The Prime Minister / President are 
single-handedly fighting the political battle... The biggest contribution 
of nine MPAs so far has been made by the Prime Ministers personal agency, 
the Intelligence Bureau... The political leadership of the Punjab is even 
not being able to retain the MPAs spoon-fed to them by the IB...
    
The paper suggests that the Governor should head the partys team in the 
province and that he should be responsible for retaining the MPAs joining 
the PPP through the IB also. The major concentration of the Joint Director 
of the Lahore IB was to be on opposition MNAs. Once they, and any MPAs he 
may target, were ensnared, he was to pass them on to the Governor in the 
province and to Syed Ijlal Haider Zaidi in the Centre.
    
As for multi-faceted Syed Ijlal Haider Zaidi: He may monitor the progress 
of targets assigned to federal ministers / MNAs and co-ordinate with Joint 
Director, IB, Lahore for fulfilment of promises in respect of MNAs joining 
through him. He may co-ordinate with Chief Minister, Punjab, on 
instructions of the Prime Minister in specific matters.
    
Saroop recommended that power be moved imperceptibly to the Governors 
House. The Governors constitutional role was to be beefed up. He was to 
freely give interviews to victims of administrative excesses on their 
requests (arranged by IB) including Wattoos political victims... He was 
to build up written records that would lead to the imposition of Governors 
rule or the dissolution of the provincial assembly, involving himself in 
such matters as the price hike, corruption, Wattoos high handedness with 
his relatives and friends, the ineffectiveness of the administration, 
increase in crime, drug trafficking, hoarding, collapse of the education 
system, and so on. All was to be put on record to be used.
    
The master-stroke was headed taming of the Judiciary:
    
As early as possible the Chief Justice of the Lahore High Court Justice 
Mehboob may be replaced with a judge loyal to the Prime Minister and 
President. Appointment of a pro-PPP Chief Justice would demoralise Mian 
Nawaz Sharif on the one hand and curb the initiative of Mian Manzoor Wattoo 
on the other. We would also attain the capability to humiliate / embarrass 
Wattoo in cases of political harassment of his opponents, corruption of his 
relatives, friends, agents, etc.
    
Lastly, The Final Decisive Blow:
    
Till the target number of MPAs have joined the PPP and the odds are 51 to 
49 for the coup, we should continue hiding our iron fist in the velvet 
glove. The final assault may be made by abrupt resignations of PPP members 
from the cabinet and simultaneous directive of the Governor to the Chief 
Minister to take a fresh vote of confidence. In case the PPP is not sure of 
the majority of MPAs supporting it, the Governor may suspend the assembly 
on the pretext of collapse of the administrative machinery, rampant 
lawlessness and complaints of cabinet members against Wattoos 
highhandedness, corruption, nepotism, victimisation of political opponents, 
etc. Note: Secrecy is the essence of the plan. This may be kept from the 
Governor also at this stage.
    
To update entrants into the political field, Raja saroop Khan of Jhelum 
learnt his soldiering at the Pakistan Military Academy (7th PMA, 1953), and 
possessing the requisite political ability, rose swiftly. He was Vice-Chief 
of General Staff, then he commanded an armoured division, went back to GHQ 
as Military Secretary, was promoted Lt-General and given command of the 
Multan Corps. Whilst at Multan, he attempted to paint Lahore red, was 
chastised but forgiven by the Mard-e-Momin. With leanings towards the right 
party, come Caretaker Moeen Qureshi, the then governor of Punjab and 
Saroops friend, General Iqbal, inducted him as provincial minister for 
local bodies. On Benazirs second arrival, his loyalty and prowess were 
acknowledged, he was made chairman of the PMs own COMREAN, and, in 
collaboration with Ijlal Haider Zaidi, worked and delivered. They destroyed 
the judiciary, got rid of Chief Justice Mehboob, and sent Wattoo to 
pasture. In 1995, Raja Saroop moved into Governors House, Lahore.
    
He has not been well recently, and Lahoris have it that he may well be 
replaced by his tactical companion, the ever- surviving Ijlal.
    
Our question: Has whatever Saroop done since his retirement been done in 
the interests of the country, or is he, and his cohorts, being supported at 
our expense to keep the PPP in power? He has at least been honest enough to 
term the IB as the Prime Ministers personal agency.
    
Our just concern: Following the strategy, the Prime Minister exiled Chief 
Justice Mehboob of the LHC and Chief Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid of Sindh to 
the Andamans. Justice Zahid took the oath and went to the Federal Shariat 
Court. Justice Mehboob refused, chose to retire, and was supplanted by 
amenable Acting Chief Justice Ilyas, who gave way to more amendable 
Acting Chief Justice Irshad. Prior to the March 20 Supreme Court order 
Justice Irshad, sailing close to the wind, requested Chief Justice of 
Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah that he be reassigned to his confirmed seat on the 
Supreme Court Bench. Subsequent to the March 20 order, Justice Khalilur 
Rahman was confirmed as Chief Justice of the LHC, and has now sent his 
recommendations regarding the confirmation of 31 judges of the LHC to 
Governor Saroop.
    
Knowing Saroops mindset, CJ Sajjad Ali Shah would better serve Pakistan by 
completely disregarding the Governors recommendations.
    
Those reading the above excerpts from Saroops Strategy Paper, would do 
well to also read Saroops second Paper, Implications of Local Bodies 
Elections in Punjab and Proposed Measures to Gain Favourable Results. Both 
Papers have been published in full by Aristoon Basit of the Idara Tehrik 
Qanoon, at Qanoon Manzil that stands behind the Lahore High Court.

<a name="agov">A government that refuses to grow up</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

REMEMBER that scene from Julius Caesar where an angry mob gets hold of 
Cinna the poet, thinking that he is Cinna the conspirator? When he tries to 
clear up the confusion, someone from the crowd shouts: Hang him for his 
bad verses.
    
Quite apart from the contents of the reference filed by the government in 
the Supreme Court asking it to clarify some aspects of its judgement in 
the so-called judges case, the drafting of this peevish document (for 
peevish it is) is so bad that those grammarians who may have had a hand in 
it richly deserve the fate of Cinna the poet.
    
Sloppy drafting usually indicates muddled thinking or mala fide intentions. 
In this instance it reflects both these characteristics. What is the 
government up to and what is it trying to prove? The occasion for the 
judges case would not have arisen if the government had kept to some 
minimum standards while appointing judges to the Sindh and Punjab high 
courts and if, later on, its functionaries in Sindh (no doubt because of 
instructions from Islamabad) had not been so zealous in getting on the 
wrong side of his lordship the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
    
But the original folly having been committed, and the Supreme Court having 
delivered its verdict, wisdom lay in putting the best possible face on 
something which the government, short of annulling the Constitution, could 
do nothing about. If one must rant and rave it should be over things one 
can influence and change. But disregarding something which would have been 
pretty obvious to most people, Prime minister Benazir Bhutto, employing 
anger and ridicule as her weapons and picking a leaf from Don Quixotes 
book of strategy, chose to pick a fight with the windmills. In doing so she 
caused no damage to the windmills. She merely drew attention (certainly not 
for the first time) to her own lack of judgment.
    
Even then, despite these hectic efforts to manufacture an artificial 
crisis, the dust raised by the Supreme Court verdict has settled. Permanent 
chief justices have started working in Lahore, Karachi and Quetta and they 
in turn, wherever necessary, seem almost to have finalised their 
recommendations about the ad hoc judges whose fate was affected by the 
Supreme Court judgment. There is no constitutional crisis in the country. 
The phrase judicial activism has come into great favour after the Supreme 
Court verdict but the Supreme Court is not threatening the government. If 
the government faces any threat, it is from its own incompetence and (lest 
we forget) the insatiable cupidity of its leading field commanders.
    
But it is a measure of the wisdom that is currently on offer that this 
government is once again trying to stoke the embers of a dead fire. The 
reference it has filed in the Supreme Court is a quibbling document whose 
aim seems more to settle scores with the Chief Justice than to gain 
elucidation on any point of law. Of the six questions that the government 
has put to the Supreme Court, two are almost wholly of an academic nature, 
two take a jab at the Chief Justice, one attempts to make a virtue of hair- 
splitting while only one relates to anything serious.
    
Question number 1 asks as to what is the test for determining the 
existence of constitutional conventions in a country governed by a written 
constitution? and can ...the convention, if any, be read in the written 
constitution in alteration of its express provisions? Question number 5 
seeks to clarify, in a convoluted manner, the doctrine of necessity. 
Important as these points may be they relate to no pressing problem facing 
the government. Where Ms Bhutto should get on with the business of 
governing, she seems more obsessed with getting her own back from Chief 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah. Had her government been dedicated to strengthening 
the rule of law, its zeal in seeking clarifications from the Supreme Court 
on points of law would have been understandable. But since that is hardly 
the case, what are the people to make of its new-found passion?
    
Questions 3 and 6 which are aimed at the Chief Justice are of a piece with 
the petulance which has been the hallmark of the governments attitude 
towards the Supreme Court ever since the latter took up the original 
petition in the judges case. Question 3, proceeding from the assumption 
that the Chief Justices own appointment is sub judice, asks as to ...What 
is the course appropriate in law for the federal government to adopt, for 
the appointment / confirmation of judges in the (superior courts)...? 
Question number 6, again basing itself on the premise that the appointment 
of the Chief Justice is disputed, asks as to how the verdict in the judges 
case may have been affected by the constitutional provisions which prohibit 
a judge from acting in a case involving his own interest...?
    
First of all, the mere filing of a writ petition by a private citizen 
against the appointment of the Chief Justice does not make his appointment 
disputed. Just as a writ petition filed by me against the President or the 
Prime minister would not make their appointments disputed. If, on the other 
hand, anything pertaining to the CJ was pending before the Supreme Judicial 
Council, the only forum which can take action against members of the 
superior judiciary, then of course we would be left with no recourse except 
to say that his appointment had become controversial. Certainly in view of 
the Supreme Courts ruling that the senior-most judge in a high court can 
legitimately expect to be made the chief justice when a vacancy occurs, the 
propriety of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shahs own elevation is all called 
into question because he was not the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court 
when the position of CJ became vacant. But if anything, this is a moral 
dilemma for him to resolve. Having been confirmed in his position by the 
very government which is now calling his appointment into question, he 
faces no legal disqualification which makes his appointment disputed.
    
Question 4 is too clever by half: What is the position of the judges, who 
were appointed / confirmed as judges in the superior courts by the acting 
chief justices during the period of martial law (1977-85) and during 1986-
88? Governments must live in the present and solve the problems for which 
they have been elected instead of fighting the battles of the past. General 
Zia did not behave kindly with the judiciary but when for that matter 
neither did Zulfikar Ali Bhutto who got several constitutional amendments 
passed whose sole purpose was to bend the judiciary to the will of the 
executive. How far back should we go in our history in order to settle the 
quarrels of the past?
    
Question 2 touches an important point: Whether all provisions of the 
Constitution, which were enacted by the framers of the Constitution, 
prevail over those which were incorporated by the chief martial law 
administrator? This is relevant in view of the Supreme Courts ruling in 
the judges case that Article 209 of the constitution (which speaks of 
security of tenure for members of the superior judiciary) takes precedence 
over Article 203-C (which allows the government to transfer judges to the 
Federal Shariat court) because the first was part of the original 1973 
Constitution while the second was incorporated into it by a military ruler. 
Consequently, what is the status of other amendments made by the military 
regime?
    
The common sense answer to this question of course is that in view of the 
Supreme Court ruling, where two such conflicting provisions occur, what 
exists in the original Constitution should take precedence over what was 
arbitrarily added to it by General Zia-ul-Haq. But this rule cannot extend 
to provisions which are no longer part of the Constitution. The Supreme 
Court can interpret the Constitution but it cannot restore to life parts of 
the Constitution which no longer exist.
    
This is not to say that the Supreme Court verdict in the judges case is in 
all respects perfect. At places reliance has been placed on less-than-
complete analogies from Islamic history. In part it is also inconsistent 
because whereas at one point it disputes the validity of amendments passed 
by a martial law dictator, at another point it presses into service the 
Objectives Resolution which was made a substantive part of the Constitution 
by a flourish of the same dictators pen. The government has every right to 
seek clarification of these points. But its intentions become suspect when 
seen against the peevishness and petulance which permeate the reference it 
has filed.

<a name="half">Half dead, or simply retired?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafizur Rahman

I heard a nice expression the other day. We were talking about the 
retirement of government officers and their re-employment, one of the 
favourite topics for gossip in Islamabad. The talk turned to a re-employed 
gentleman who would count senior even among senior citizens. A wag among us 
used the idiom of second- hand tyres to describe him. He has been re-
treaded after the bypass and is now good for another five years, he said.
    
Long superannuated and now re-employed officers are not inclined to be 
flippant about themselves. For them the words used to obtain the Prime 
Ministers approval for extension in service are sacred words: invaluable 
experience, proven ability, unimpeachable integrity, definitely 
irreplaceable and similar other epithets culled from Rogets Thesaurus.
    
They are not just ordinary expressions. For the officer concerned they are 
golden testimonials (even if untrue) which may win him a further year or 
two in service, because, failing that, he would be shoved into the limbo of 
powerlessness and oblivion.
    
Not that all officers who get extensions really need them, financially 
speaking that is. It is rare that an officer has no house of his own to 
live in, or his children are not yet out of college. Nine out of ten 
retired officers are fairly well-off and have no money problems to speak 
of.
    
There are cases of bachelor or childless federal secretaries retiring in 
the highest scale that the government can give, with nobody to spend their 
gratuity on. But they still crave for extra service after superannuation, 
and even after superfluity, and would be willing to give five years of 
their lives for another year in service. The reason is that most of them do 
not know what to do with themselves after they have been sent home.
    
For the government officer, service has been the be-all and end-all of 
existence. He knows nothing apart from the business of government service. 
His whole thinking, the language he uses, the outlook he displays even in 
domestic problems, the entire idiom of his life style, all are derived from 
the routine daily drudgery of office work, of meetings and discussions, of 
minutes and agendas, of budgets and accounts.
    
Since these are of no use to him in after-life  retirement for him is 
almost after-life  and he has no hobby, no pastime, no other vocation, he 
becomes a lost cow, to use a Punjabi expression. No wonder he will beg, 
borrow or steal to get as much extra time as he can. The evil day when he 
must vacate his office chair and lose the company of his PA and his naib 
qasid must be put off somehow. A good half of him dies when he finally goes 
home.
    
There are sound reasons for this. The truth is that today, notwithstanding 
the development of big business and industry and modern methods of 
agriculture and the arts and the sciences, the non-official genius is still 
counted lower in status and prestige than the official mediocrity.
    
He may have made a name for himself at the international level in any one 
of these fields, yet he is not a patch on the higher- grade wallah in 
government service.
    
Tangible respectability in social life is still for the so- called senior 
officer. A Faiz Ahmed Faiz or a Sadequain or a Dr Abdus Salam are denied 
admittance into the VIP lounge at our airports, and the flunkey in charge 
will feel indignant at their temerity if they dared to consider themselves 
entitled to this facility. But see how he welcomes an Additional Secretary, 
bowing and scraping before him, even though intrinsically he may not be fit 
to be a medical salesman.
    
Private organisations, philanthropic bodies and social welfare agencies 
would rather cancel a function than be obliged to invite as chief guest a 
public figure not connected with the government of the day.
    
They know that if they ask the Director General of Animal Husbandry for the 
purpose, they are likely to get a better Press and a larger turnout of 
guests and invitees, and may even have the PTV cameraman around if they 
know the ropes, than if they are silly enough to request Seth Ahmed Dawood 
to do the honours.
    
The organisers would fare no better if in place of the Seth they were to 
ask a retired officer, even though he were a pharoah in his time, to be the 
guest of honour. The guests would be there but the honour would be sadly 
missing.
    
The most pathetic aspect of this state of affairs is that the poor retired 
officer does not even command the respect and attention of his erstwhile 
colleagues who are still in office. His visit to his old place of work is 
termed a nuisance, and any requests that he may have to make, either about 
his pensionary dues or to obtain help in other personal matters, are faced 
with ill-concealed annoyance.
    
It is then that he gets an entirely different view of the world, but 
completely forgets that this is exactly how he too used to behave. I can 
vividly recall a lecture I heard by a retired federal secretary, a terrible 
snob in his time, but now considerably chastened, advising the audience of 
government servants to treat the public with consideration, patience and 
sympathy, something he had never done himself while in office.
    
The only administrative reform needed in a democratic Pakistan is to stop 
the concentration of power and authority in a comparatively small number of 
officers, to involve political cadres in ever greater numbers at all levels 
of the administration and to privatise whatever government activity can be 
possibly given up. No amount of harangues and homilies and courses in NIPA 
and the Administrative Staff College can serve the same purpose.

Mazdak

WHENEVER a particularly unsavoury aspect of life in Pakistan is uncovered 
and makes headlines locally and internationally, the first reaction is not 
to do something about it, but to blame somebody, anybody, for maligning us.
    
This knee-jerk reaction was in evidence when the Human Rights Commission of 
Pakistan sent a task force into rural Sindh to identify private jails being 
maintained by waderas, and free bonded haris who were being kept there, 
often in chains. In a series of raids, HRCP volunteers accompanied by 
journalists released around a thousand haris, some of whom had been in 
bondage for 24 years. Foreign reporters and TV crews flew in to cover this 
scandalous story, and initially, officials helped the HRCP team, and even 
registered some FIRs against the feudals and their managers, something 
unheard of in the rural areas.
    
So far, so good. Then the backlash set in. A chorus of statements, articles 
and letters to editors have appeared, all aimed at informing us that we are 
ignorant of rural realities, and the practice of literally tying haris to 
the land was actually a partnership between tenant and landlord. The whole 
thing was a plot to reduce Sindhs agricultural output, and thus weaken 
Sindhis as a whole vis-a-vis non-Sindhis. Some defenders of this system 
have even justified enslaving haris on the grounds that they had taken 
loans from feudals and therefore should be restrained from leaving their 
lands until they had paid their debts back.
    
If we extend this argument a little further, all those feudals, politicians 
and businessmen who have taken loans from banks should be held captive by 
bankers until they have cleared their debts. A friend suggested that they 
be locked up in bank vaults. Instead, they default on their loans and then 
grace obscenely opulent houses, parliament buildings and corporate 
boardrooms. Thus, those who welsh on loans worth billions of rupees are 
rewarded, while poor haris who take advances worth a few thousand rupees 
have to be locked up until they have repaid these small amounts, something 
they can seldom do because of the burden of the crippling compound 
interests.
    
In theory, these unfortunate haris are supposed to get a third of the 
produce they grow. Although this compares poorly with the fifty per cent 
their counterparts in upper Sindh retain, they are denied even this 
pittance in the districts of lower Sindh where these recent incidents have 
occurred. According to some of the haris who have been freed from 
captivity, their families were lucky to get a hundred rupees a month. 
Basically, all they received was a minimum of simple food. Thus, most of 
their legitimate share is being forcibly expropriated by their feudal 
masters, and this helps to explain the indolent and dissolute lifestyle of 
so many of this class.
    
A sad but unsurprising aspect of the whole affair is the fact that 
virtually all the enslaved haris are Bheels, Kohlis and Meghwars  Hindu 
tribes that have inhabited lower Sindh long before the advent of Islam. 
They are true aboriginals in the sense that they are very close to nature, 
and have passively resisted the advance of our so-called civilisation. 
Gentle, self- effacing folk, they have seen their land, their very world, 
encroached and expropriated by outsiders. No longer able to live free, they 
have been subjected to the ultimate indignity of slavery. No politician 
raises his voice on their behalf because they are effectively 
disenfranchised. In any case, their plight counts for nothing when compared 
with the dictates of the wadera. To make matters worse, there are people 
who are saying that because of the recent uproar, members of the scheduled 
castes should no longer be given work.
    
The relationship between feudal and tenant, loaded in favour of the former, 
is even more lopsided in Sindh. Here, the droit de seigneur  that 
revolting medieval practice of giving the feudal landlord the right to take 
any new bride on his lands to his bed on her marriage  is still alive. No 
daughter of a tenant is safe, and Hindus are specially vulnerable to these 
depredations. The Bheels, Kohlis and Meghwar of lower Sindh are regularly 
subjected to this institutionalised rape by waderas and their underlings.
    
The role of the Sindh government during this furore has been highly 
equivocal. Initially, police and district authorities paid no heed to the 
letters sent by HRCPs Hyderabad representative, Shakeel Pathan. But after 
he took a group of journalists with him to release scores of imprisoned 
haris, the Deputy Commissioners of Hyderabad and Badin districts were 
supportive, and FIRs were registered against some of the offending farm 
managers. However, there has since been a volte face: the few people who 
had been arrested have been released, and the two DCs have been 
transferred. It seems that the feudals have triumphed again.
    
Despite progress in other parts of the world and in our own region, the 
stranglehold of feudalism has been strengthened in Pakistan with the shaky 
return of democracy. the present government, of course, has a strong feudal 
base, but even Nawaz Sharif depended heavily on the support of Punjabi 
landlords. Thus, despite the chronic fiscal crunch successive governments 
have faced, no agricultural tax has ever been imposed. Similarly, no leader 
has been able to push through meaningful land reforms aimed at 
redistributing land and political power.
    
Although the Sindh Chief Minister has stated that his government is against 
bonded labour, his actions belied his words. By transferring officials who 
had helped to free the enslaved haris, he has sent a clear signal to their 
colleagues in the field not to move against the interests of the landlords. 
Shakeel Pathan, the courageous chief of the HRCP task force, has received 
many death threats. An MPAs sidekicks have forcibly released detained 
employees from police custody in Shakeels presence, and to date, no action 
has been taken against them.
    
Some of the released haris were given shelter in a Christian mission. These 
missionaries are now being criticised for aiding and abetting those who 
want to see the present system abolished; some voices have been raised in 
favour of closing down the mission altogether. As I.A. Rehman said at a 
recent HRCP Press conference, instead of doing something ourselves to help 
the released haris, we are carping at those who are assisting them. So what 
else is new?
    
Nobody knows how many more haris are living in shackles, brutalised for 
paltry sums they borrowed years ago, and have repaid many times over 
through their hard work. Although a law banning this cruel practice was 
enacted in 1992, it is observed in the breach by powerful waderas who know 
that neither the federal nor the provincial government will move against 
them. When the chips are down, class interests are much stronger than 
convictions</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="aqui">Aqib, Basit dropped on disciplinary grounds</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, May 21: All the floodgates of criticism were opened here on 
Tuesday by the Pakistan Cricket Board when they announced three uncapped 
players, retained Ataur Rahman and instead bowled out Ramiz Raja, Aqib 
Javed and Basit Ali from the 17-member England-bound team announced at the 
National Stadium.
    
The three uncapped players include Shadab Kabir, Shahid Nazir and Shahid 
Anwer without any notable performance in the season. Paceman Ataur Rahman 
succeeded in getting into the team through the back door, courtesy Wasim 
Akram.
    
Asif Mujtaba, former Pakistan vice-captain, fought his way back into the 
national squad due to hard work and performance in the field by scoring a 
record eight centuries on his way to score 1,350 runs in the just concluded 
1995-96 circuit.
    
Former first choice wicketkeeper, Moin Khan, also managed to safeguard his 
position. Wasim Akram, of course, was an automatic choice after he resumed 
his duties as captain after making himself available for the prestigious 
but quite a difficult tour.
    
The team named by the Chief Executive of the PCB, Arif Abbasi, is:
    
Aamir Sohail (vice-captain) (ABL), Saeed Anwar (ADBP), Shahid Anwer (NBP), 
Shadab Kabir (Karachi), Salim Malik (HBL), Ejaz Ahmad (HBL), Inzamamul Haq 
(UBL), Asif Mujtaba (PIA), Wasim Akram (captain) (PIA), Waqar Younis (ABL), 
Mohammad Akram (ABL), Ataur Rahman (ABL), Shahid Nazir (Faisalabad, Rashid 
Latif (ABL), Moin Khan (PIA), Mushtaq Ahmad (UBL) and Saqlain Mushtaq 
(PIA).
    
The nine reserves are:
    
Basit Ali (UBL), Sohail Jaffar (PNSC), Salim Elahi (UBL), Aqib Javed (ABL), 
Aamir Nazir (ABL), Sajid Shah (PNSC), Azhar Mahmood (UBL), Arshad Khan 
(ABL) and Wasim Yousufi (UBL).
    
The PCB official tried all the tricks he had in his bag to justify the 
selections and ousters, though he was apparently unconvincing.
    
Abbasi, who tried to handle a crowded Press conference alone, didnt answer 
most of the queries, saying: This question should be directed to the 
Chairman Selection Committee or this information can be sought from the 
Chief Selector.
    
However, Arif Abbasi admitted that the reasons for the ouster of Ramiz 
Raja, Aqib Javed and Basit Ali was indiscipline, lack of commitment and a 
lax attitude towards the game and team. The Selection Committee has given 
significant importance to discipline and from now on, it has become a 
policy decision.
    
Any of the players found misbehaving on the England tour and onwards, will 
simply be handed over the return ticket. There will be no hanky panky now, 
he said.
    
The players dont seem to realise that it is because of this country that 
they are respected the world over. Had it not been Pakistan, they would 
have not seen a cricket ground, let alone playing on it. It is very sad 
that they are doing this to this country, Abbasi, in an emotional tone, 
asserted.
    
Abbasi was, nevertheless, dumbfounded when asked if only Basit, Aqib and 
Ramiz came in the bracket of discipline.
    
If the PCB starts the scrutiny of players involved in misbehaviour or 
indiscipline, well, then half of the team members would be dropped 
including skipper Wasim Akram himself.
    
Interestingly, Abbasi accused Aqib, Basit and Ramiz of violating players 
Code of Conduct, but no specific incidents were mentioned. In the just 
concluded season none of the three players was either warned, reprimanded 
or disciplined by the cricket board or even by the cricket manager.
    
It is believed that the ouster of the trio is on the recommendation and 
insistence of skipper Wasim Akram. According to well placed sources, a 
couple of selectors were in favour of Basit and Aqib but surrendered before 
the whims of the skipper.

KARACHI, May 22: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) named Yawar Saeed, having 
experience of English county cricket, and Nasimul Ghani, former Test 
spinner, as managers for the tour of England.
    
The decision, having been approved by the Council, was announced by Chief 
Executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, Arif Abbasi.
    
Saeed is to be the tour manager while Ghani will be the cricket manager.
    
Abbasi stated that the two were the best choices the board had under the 
present circumstances. The board official stated that stress of the two 
managers will be on discipline.
    
The Chief Executive further emphasised that the list of nine standbys 
should be considered very seriously since they may be sent on any 
emergency.
    
The two managers were not at the National Stadium on Wednesday afternoon 
but they along with skipper Wasim Akram have an appointment with the Chief 
Executive at 11:00 a.m. The trio is expected to be briefed about their 
respective assignments on the most difficult tours.

<a name="isit">Is it the end of Ramizs fine career? </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter
    
KARACHI, May 21: When a player at the age of 34 is dropped and not placed 
in standbys also, does it not indicate that the international career of 
that cricketer has ended?
    
Ramiz Hasan Raja, born on Aug 14, 1962 at Faisalabad, finds himself in that 
awkward position after he was not considered for selection for the England 
tour and even failed to get into the list of nine reserves.
    
Since making his Test debut in 1983-84 against David Gowers Englishmen, 
Ramiz Raja played 55 Tests and scored 2,747 runs from 91 innings. He 
averaged 31.94. In his 13-year career, Raja could reach the three figures 
only twice but managed to scored 32 half centuries. He held 32 catches.
    
However, Ramiz Raja earned the reputation of a brilliant batsman in one-day 
internationals in which he represented the country in 177 games scoring 
5,386 runs at a healthy average of 33.04.
    
Raja scored nine centuries which is an all time record for Pakistan. Saeed 
Anwar (8), Javed Miandad (8) and Zaheer Abbas (7) are the other main 
century scorers.
    
Raja is Pakistans only the third batsman to have scored more than 5,000 
runs in one-day cricket. Javed Miandad (7,381) and Salim Malik (5,833) are 
the two other batsmen.
    
Ramiz Raja, who modelled himself into his childhood idol Majid Khan, 
remained one of the most respected, scandal-free and noncontroversial 
figures.
    
Raja, who was dropped after the 1993 tour of the West Indies, achieved the 
distinction which every cricketer wants to havecaptain his team in a Test
when he was appointed to lead Pakistan in the home series against Sri 
Lanka. However, it was a bitter experience as evident from the result, 
Pakistan lost both the Test and one-day series 1-2. To rub salt to the 
wound, Rajas team failed to qualify for the Champions Trophy final last 
October.
    
Raja was removed from captaincy but no one figured out that Raja was 
leading a team which was a depleted one. Raja didnt have Wasim Akram, 
Waqar played only one Test, Salim Malik and Ejaz Ahmad were not considered 
because of betting and match-fixing allegations and Basit was considered 
only for the Sialkot Test.
    
Even then, Raja emerged as the second leading scorer for Pakistan with 208 
runs in five innings behind Moin Khan. In the same series, Raja became the 
first Pakistan skipper to win a Test by an innings in his debut as skipper.
    
Rajas handling of the ball tampering issue at Lords one-day game on the 
1992 tour will be long remembered. Raja was incharge when Javed Miandad and 
Salim Malik were in the dressing room because of injuries.
    
During his fine career, Raja played three World Cups and his most memorable 
moment should be the catch of Dermott Reeve at the Melbourne Cricket Ground 
on March 25, 1992 which gave Pakistan a historic World Cup triumph in the 
final over England.
    
Raja has been a great ambassador for cricket and of his country. His role 
and services to the sport will be long remembered. But no one knows if he 
will make another miraculous comeback to the national team as he did 
earlier in the season.
    
No one but the selectors actually know the reasons for Ramizs ouster from 
the England tour after he scored 504 runs with five half centuries from 13 
Test innings.

<a name="inti">Intikhab expresses displeasure</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, May 22: Outgoing Pakistan cricket manager Intikhab Alam on 
Wednesday expressed his disappointment that he was not considered for the 
job for the coming tour of England.
    
Speaking from Lahore, the former manager said: Yes, I am disappointed. I 
think I have always rendered my services when the country needed me. I 
always made myself available when either the team or management was in 
crisis.
    
The former Pakistan captain stated that his last tenure was not as bad as 
presented. We won the Singapore tournament and the performance of the team 
was also not bad on the tour Down Under. We lost the Sharjah Cup and the 
World Cup because certain leading players were unfit.
    
It is not the right way to proceed. Will the board change the newly 
appointed manager if the team lost either in England or Canada or Kenya? 
Intikhab questioned.
    
The former Surrey and PIA captain commenting on his future association with 
Pakistan cricket said he thought it was time to settle down. I have had a 
long innings with Pakistan cricket and I must thank my wife who always 
stood alongside me under very trying situations and circumstances.
    
Intikhab maintained that if it is alleged that he couldnt handle the 
players how come he remain manager for 16 years. It has got to do more 
with professional jealousy than other things.
    
Managership is basically a very thankless job. When the team wins, all 
credit goes to the skipper but if the team loses, manager is on the 
receiving end.
    
Nevertheless, I have thoroughly enjoyed my 16 years as manager, Intikhab 
said.
    
The former leg-spinner made it clear that he never recommended that Aqib 
Javed or Basit Ali be dropped on disciplinary grounds. I have never 
mentioned in my report that I faced any disciplinary problems on my last 
two tours.
    
Intikhab congratulated the new management, saying: My best wishes are with 
them. I pray that they come up to the expectations of the country. England 
is a very difficult tour but I am hopeful that they (managers) will be able 
to give their best and the team will return triumphant.

<a name="burk">Burki for strengthening club cricket</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

KARACHI, May 16: Mr Javed Burki, Adviser to President Farooq Ahmed Khan  
Leghari on cricket affairs, said here today several attempts had been made 
for stabilising the system and even the existing one, under which Pakistan 
Cricket Board is being run, is aimed at achieving the desired objective.
    
Former Pakistan captain Javed Burki, who had been associated with the board 
directly or indirectly for considerably long time, stated that no less than 
three times the ad hoc committees were appointed to improve the affairs. 
The prevailing system for running the cricket board, with a council of 
elected representatives,  according to the former Pakistan captain, 
reflects democracy.
    
The Adviser to the President who is Patron of the PCB, underlined the 
imperative need of strengthening club cricket, the foundation and base of 
national cricket.
    
He expressed his dissatisfaction over the affairs of club cricket and in 
this connection he praised Sri Lanka and Australia where club cricket is 
the real base.
    
Sri Lanka has a systematic and strong club cricket, highly competitive 
producing talented youngsters for further polishing and grooming at the 
international level despite the fact that they have no first class 
tournaments.
    
Now Sri Lanka is the World Cup champions in a short span of time, he 
stressed.
    
Similarly he was all praise for the grade cricket in  Australia and the 
talented and promising youngsters on their performance make their mark in 
Test sides as well as in one day internationals, Mr Javed Burki opined.
    
However, he called England club cricket  as gymkhana cricket, friendly 
encounter and the gentlemens game lacking high competitive spirit as 
compared to Australias grade cricket and Sri Lanka club competitions.

<a name="anot">Another battle for Imran in London</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, May 21: In 1977 when the Australian millionaire Kerry Packer took 
the authorities at Lords to court to defend and win the rights to employ 
cricketers for his privately-organised World Series Cricket, it had come as 
a shock t6o the cricketing world. Nearly a two decades on, now libel cases, 
involving cricketers and cricket, is a sort of common occurrence.
    
The recent being the case between former Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz 
and his Northamptonshire county colleague, the South African born Allan 
Lamb. The case in London court challenging Lambs accusation of ball 
tampering by the Pakistanis fizzled out mid-way when Sarfraz for personal 
reasons decided to withdraw and back out fearing enormous costs in case he 
lost.
    
In another case of that sort, the Derbyshire and England fast bowler Devon 
Malcolm of West Indian extract won substantial damages against `Wisden 
Cricket Monthly for an article published last year by a freelance 
journalist which implied that the black cricketers playing for England do 
not give their hundred percent to the team as do the homebred Englishmen.
    
Early this year former England captain Mike Gatting received apology in 
writing from the former captain of Pakistan, Imran Khan, and five-figure 
damages and apology from the writer Ivo Tennant and the publishers Cassells 
for slurs in Imrans latest biography.
    
The utterances in the book such as, Gatting epitomised and brought to the 
England game the outlook of a racially prejudiced Englishmen, and that 
Gatting had been responsible for stripping from international cricket any 
remaining veneer of honour and decency, had prompted Gatting to take the 
libel action against the writer and the publisher. Imran was not sued but 
had apologised in writing to Gatting stressing that he held the former 
England captain in great respect as a sportsman.
    
The offending sections in book was later removed before the paperback 
edition of Imrans biography published in 1994 was brought back to the 
shelves.
    
For Imran, the battle is not yet over because another court case is to be 
heard on July 15, only 10 days before the first Pakistan Test against 
England at Lords this summer.
    
Not far from the home of cricket, both Ian Botham and Allan Lamb will be 
claiming damages and an apology by the former Pakistan captain Imran Khan 
in separate actions alleging libel over interviews published in `India 
Today which is in circulation in England as well and an Imran interview in 
`The Sun following the publication of his biography in which he had; 
admitted that he gouged the ball 11 with a bottle top in a game involving 
Sussex and Warwickshire and that the practice of raising the seam was 
practised by many other bowlers in county cricket.
    
Both the cricketers have not sued the offending papers but have brought 
their court action against Imran personally.
    
Neither of them is backing out of it nor is Imran who is adamant to see it 
through.
    
Ian Botham after Imrans interview in The Sun had retorted: I have never 
cheated nor, to the best of my knowledge, did the England guys with whom I 
played in Tests and one-day international cricket for 16 years.
    
Imrans allegations that ordinary county cricketer is `fairly racist has 
also prompted the two, Botham and Lamba to take the legal action.
    
In `India Today, in an answer to a question by Shehkar Gupta about the 
hype about balls tampering, Imran had allegedly replied, It is the English 
media and a section of cricketers who have blown it out of all proportions. 
There is a lot of racism here. When Bob Willis or Freddie Trueman were 
tearing the heart out of Indian or Pakistan batting, we never heard an 
outcry about short-pitched bowling. How come the noise started when the 
West Indies and the Pakistanis began winning matches with their fast 
bowlers? How come we never heard about slow over-rates until the West 
Indies fast bowlers came along? The Australians can get away with anything 
because they are whites. There is a lot of racism in this society. Look at 
people such as Lamb and Botham making statements like: `Oh, I never thought 
much of him anyway and now it has been proven he is a cheat. Where is this 
hatred coming from? You remember the way Bishen Bedi was victimised in the 
Vaseline incident because he dared to question John Lever, for cheating in 
Delhi.
    
In an answer to a question about whether English cricket suffers from class 
problem, Imran had replied: Yes look at people who have taken a rational 
side in the controversy. Tony Lewis, Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Derek 
Pringle.
   
They are all educated, Oxbridge types. Look at the others, Lamb, Botham, 
Trueman. The difference in class and upbringing makes a difference.
    
There are the sorts of comments which are likely to be probed by the 
lawyers of Botham and Lamb.
    
There will be a lot of cricketers involved as witnesses for both the 
parties. Derek Pringle who once wrote on his retirement that, Any seam 
bowler worth his salt picks the seam of a ball, has however reported to 
have declined a request from Imran to support his statement. This is a 
squabble that should be sorted out over a drink or a cup of tea. It is not 
a fitting way to conclude their rivalry, he had said.
    
Imrans solicitor, Howard Cohen is however sure that the announcement of 
Imrans political aspirations will not have any impact on the case: He is 
very determined to defend this action and I have not heard anything to 
suggest that these events have affected his determination, he had said.
