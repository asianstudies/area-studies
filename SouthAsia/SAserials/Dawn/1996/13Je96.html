<a name="21pe">21 perish in Hyderabad building collapse</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aziz Malik

HYDERABAD, June 12: At least 21 people were killed and an equal number 
injured when a four-storey old building collapsed near Market Tower here at 
5.30am on Wednesday. The number of casualties was feared to rise once the 
rubble was removed.
    
The rangers moved in and started rescue operation, army engineering corps 
volunteers, Edhi centre and other social welfare organisations also joined 
the rescue operation.
    
Army cranes, bulldozers and dumpers of a Chinese firm of the Jamshoro grid 
station and excavators and loaders of Hyderabad Municipal Corporation are 
working to lift the rubble.
    
The entire staff of the Hyderabad Municipal Corporation reached the Civil 
Hospital and put up a camp there to provide medicines and other help to the 
injured.
    
The occupants of the building, about eleven families comprising 94 persons, 
belonged to the Arain community were close relatives.
    
The catastrophe would have been even greater but for a power breakdown, 
which had compelled the male members to leave the building and sit or sleep 
outside.
    
The cause of collapse was a 15-feet deep excavation adjacent to the 
building by a builder and abandoned for three years which had weakened its 
foundations. 
    
The area people held the builder and the building control department of HDA 
responsible.
    
Mohammad Yousuf's family was most unfortunate whose entire members " wife, 
two daughters and a son " died with him.
    
The bodies were removed to civil hospital here and finally laid to rest 
after last rituals performed by the Edhi volunteers.

</a>Pakistan has deployed M-11s, says US report
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, June 12: US intelligence agencies have claimed that Pakistan 
has deployed nuclear-capable Chinese M-11 missiles and that the transfer 
was part of a plan to skirt missile-control agreements, the  Washington 
Times reported.
    
The finding is expected to trigger US economic sanctions against both 
Pakistan and China based on a 1990 law, the paper claimed in a special 
report by correspondent Bill Gertz, who first reported the alleged transfer 
of ring magnets to Pakistan from China earlier this year.
    
The intelligence agencies declaration, the paper claimed, contained in 
inter-agency reports produced last month, confirms for the first time 
that Pakistan now has a strategic nuclear delivery capability.
    
CIA and State Department spokesmen would not comment on the intelligence 
reports. A Chinese embassy spokesman also declined to comment.
    
A Pakistani embassy spokesman denied that any M-11s were operational in his 
country or that any were bought from China.
    
State department officials, however, are trying to block the intelligence 
judgement through bureaucratic manoeuvring to avoid imposing sanctions, 
according to intelligence sources, the report said.

<a name="govt">Govt set to achieve 39 percent literacy rate</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Habib Khan Ghori

KARACHI, June 11: Sindh Minister for Education Agha Siraj Durrani said the 
government had adopted a new approach to make education public-oriented and 
community-supported at the grassroots level.
    
Highlighting the silent features of the government policy, he said: The 
new strategy is based on Parent-Teacher Associations to monitor and 
supervise the performance of all private and public sector schools while 
the Educational Advisory Council, a steering body headed by the 
provincial minister of education, will be entrusted with the task of 
implementing the government policy and attaining social targets.
    
Agha Durrani said the government was attaching top priority to education 
because development and prosperity could never be achieved without 
acquiring modern education and raising the literacy rate.
    
We are optimistic that our efforts would pave the way for achieving the 
literacy rate of 39 per cent as against the 31.4 per cent in the province 
according to the 1981 census.
    
The governments commitment can be gauged from the fact that despite 
financial constraints the provincial government allocated Rs 1255.669 
million for the education sector from the annual development programme 
which is 18.8 per cent of the total size of the ADP of Rs 7000 million.
    
Besides, the government allocated Rs 1.260 billion as counterpart funds 
for the foreign-aided projects in the education sector.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 10: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Monday denied 
opposition charges that she had purchased a mansion in Surrey, England and 
termed them part of the oppositions plan to oust her from power by playing 
dirty tricks.
    
I consider it below my dignity to reply to them other than to say that I 
am too busy running the country instead of buying houses, she told 
reporters at a news conference in her assembly chamber.
    
She said the opposition was spending huge money on getting such fabricated 
stories published in foreign newspapers. I know that all the vested 
interests who had earned black money have once again united against me and 
want to oust me before March 1997 when the term of the chairman of Senate 
would expire.

<a name="resi">Residential plots for the poor to be developed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 9: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has directed the provincial 
government to develop residential plots for common people at Tehsil and 
district headquarters levels on a priority basis, said provincial Housing 
and Town Planning Minister Abdul Hakeem Baloch.

Besides, the town planning department has also been directed to launch an 
incremental housing development programme, starting with two pilot projects 
at Tando Mohammad Khan and Tando Adam, providing 120-square yard plots to 
the poor on affordable and easy instalments. The scheme will take off next 
month on the pattern of Khuda Ki Basti.
    
The minister explained that the government would provide land and municipal 
services would be at cost. Initially, 250 plots of 120 square yards each 
would be made available in Bhitai Nagar Housing Scheme in Tando Adam and 
Miran Mohammad Shah Housing Scheme in Tando Mohammad Khan, he added.

<a name="kmct">KMC to get 100 more seats before LB polls</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Reporter

KARACHI, June 7: The strength of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation will be 
increased by another 100 seats before the local bodies elections this year, 
official sources said.
    
Ms Bhutto said increase in the KMC seats had become inevitable due to 
increase in the population of the megalopolis, said the spokesman.
    
She said since the number of KMC seats had been fixed at 220 about two 
decades back, municipal units had become as big as provincial assembly 
constituencies.
    
Delimitation of the constituencies would have to be undertaken soon to make 
it more uniform and rational, she added. She said due to lack of uniformity 
some constituencies comprised 40,000 votes while others were comparatively 
small. This discrepancy, she said, made her party secure less seats.
    
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said the decision to increase the number of 
seats was in conformity with the governments promise to devolve power to 
the grassroots level and added it was necessary to reduce the size of the 
constituency.
    
She said the commission for conducting local bodies elections was 
independent and as such the ruling party will have to make its case very 
strong to convince the commission to increase the number of constituencies.
    
For this purpose, she said, the PPP had formed a committee, headed by Abdul 
Khaliq Jumma which would provide legal assistance to the PPP councillors in 
presenting their case before the election commission.

<a name="hari">Haris accuse govt of depriving them of legal rights</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

HYDERABAD, June 7: The Sindhi Hari Tahreek has regretted that instead of 
protecting the rights of poor haris some landlords and the government 
itself were trying to deprive the peasants of their legal rights.
    
The meeting, under the chairmanship of Vishnu Mal, observed that the haris 
had pinned great hopes on the present government but they had been greatly 
disappointed.

The meeting resolved to launch a struggle through out the province in 
furtherance of the above objectives.
    
Meanwhile, the chairperson Sindhi Qaumi Saath (Sindhi Nation Association), 
Ms Fahmida Qureshi, in a statement has charged that a big zamindar of 
Sanghar Mureed Mari, who owned 12000 acres of land, was holding 2500 haris 
in bondage.
    
She claimed that during her recent tour of Sanghar, she had personally 
given 200 names of bonded haris to the deputy commissioner of Sanghar.

<a name="prop">Proportion of workers goes down, except in agriculture</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, June 11: The proportion of workers in all sectors except 
agriculture has gone down in Pakistan during the last three years, 
according to the economic survey for 1995-96 released here on Tuesday.
    
The share of agriculture workers increased from 46.62 per cent in 1992-93 
(reported in labour force survey, 1992-93 and 1993-94) to an estimated 
49.06 per cent in 1995-96.
    
As against the share of 25.66 per cent in 1992-93, production workers 
account for 24.69 per cent in total labour force in the current year. The 
proportion of professional workers declined from 4.83 per cent to 4.59 per 
cent; administrative workers from 1.19 per cent to 0.94 per cent, clerical 
workers from 4.54 per cent to 4.37 per cent, sales workers from 12.56 per 
cent to 11.98 per cent and services workers from 4.60 per cent to 4.56 per 
cent.
    
In conjunction with the shrinkage of workers in most occupations, the 
survey also reports substantial rise in the number of unemployed from 1.23 
million in 1994-95 to 1.78 million in the current year, said the survey. 
That the situation may be much worse is indicated by the definition of 
employment given in the document. It does not include workers who have 
stopped seeking employment due to frustration.

<a name="econ">Economic Survey released : GDP goes up but deficit persists</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, June 11: The overall economic situation during 1995-96 improved 
significantly, with 6.1 per cent GDP growth, 5 per cent budget deficit and 
monetary expansion brought down at 8.4 per cent but the balance of payment 
position came under pressure and prices showed upward trends.
    
According to the Economic Survey for 1995-96, there has been marked 
improvement in macro-economic indicators specially 6.1 per cent GDP growth 
rate compared to 4.4 per cent in 1994-95.
    
The growth rate improved considerably specially due to growth in 
agriculture sector which was recorded at 6.7 per cent with record 
production figures for rice and wheat.
    
Cotton has been a major factor which contributed to overall agricultural 
growth during the current year when it recorded an increase of 21.8 per 
cent.
    
Although the budget deficit came down to 5 per cent the target of 4.6 per 
cent envisaged for the current year could not be met. The survey claimed 
that there was a greater elasticity in government revenue because of fiscal 
checks taken during the year.
    
The growth of value-added items in the manufacturing sector increased by 
4.8 per cent in 1995-96 from 2.9 per cent during the previous year. Growth 
in large-scale manufacturing based on the production of 96 items, having 
73.7 per cent weight in the large-scale manufacturing sector, improved by 
3.1 per cent during 1995-96 as against lower growth of 0.5 per cent 
achieved in 1994-95.
    
Balance of payment position and prices remained a matter of concern. 
However, the survey said the overall BOP position showed an improvement 
during 1994-95. Exports revived with 17. 9 per cent (FOB) increase which 
took them to 7.8 billion dollars from 6.6 billion dollars recorded in 1993-
94. This substantial increase brought the trade deficit down from 3.8 per 
cent of GDP in 1993-94 to 3.7 per cent in 1995-96. The inflow under private 
unrequited transfers (net) increased by 7.0 million dollars and aggregated 
at 2.3 billion dollars (exactly 2397 million dollars).
    
Workers remittances swung from negative growth of 7.5 over cent in 1993-94 
to a marked increase of 29.1 per cent and stood at 1.8 billion dollars in 
1994-95 compared to 1.4 billion dollars recorded in 1993-94. As a result, 
current account deficit amounted to 2.4 billion dollars which was about 3.9 
per cent of GDP. The inflow on account of long-term capital (net) rose from 
2.5 billion dollars in 1993-94 to 2.9 billion dollars in 1995- 96, showing 
an increase of 416 million dollars or 16.3 per cent. The netting out of 
necessary adjustments has closed the year with a foreign exchange reserves 
build of 242 million dollars.
    
The budget estimates for 1995-96 envisaged further improvement in the BOP 
position. It was anticipated that as a result of better performance of 
exports, trade deficit would decline to 1.9 billion dollars from 2.2 
billion dollars in 1994- 95, reflecting an improvement of 12.1 per cent. 
Thus, trade deficit was expected to come to 3.1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. 
The total balance of payments position during the first half of the current 
year came under pressure due to decline in exports coupled with higher 
imports. The corrective measures were taken in October 1995 which include 
devaluation of rupee by 7 per cent against dollar and imposition of 
regulatory duty of 10 per cent on imports.
    
As regards prices, the survey said the Consumer Price Index (CPI), with 
1990-91 as its base, covers 467 items encompassing almost the entire range 
of familys basket of goods and services. It is, therefore, the most 
frequently used indicator of inflation. During July-April 1995-96, the CPI 
for all income groups recorded an increase of 9.77 per cent which is less 
than the increase of 10.82 per cent in the same period last year.
    
The mining and quarrying sector experienced a shift from a negative growth 
rate of 4.3 per cent in 1994-95 to a positive growth of 8.3 per cent in 
1995-96. The output of coal crude oil and mineral sector, witnessed an 
increase of 10.2, 4.4 and 14.5 per cent respectively. Limestone production 
decreased by 5.3 per cent while the production of rock salt recorded an 
increase of 6.1 per cent.
    
About savings and investment, the Economic Survey said that total 
investment outlay in 1995-96 was estimated at Rs425.2 billion against 
Rs349.1 billion during the last year which showed an increase of 21.8 per 
cent. Fixed investment increased by 21.5 per cent from Rs320.9 billion in 
1994-95 to Rs390.0 billion in 1995-96. The share of total investment in GNP 
(market prices) came to 19.4 per cent during 1995-96 compared to 18.6 per 
cent the previous year.
    
National Savings was estimated to finance 71.3 per cent of total investment 
and 28.7 per cent was financed by foreign savings. Foreign savings 
increased by 10.2 per cent during 1995-96.
    
About expenses, it said out of total expenditure of Rs494.9 billion, 
Rs371.3 billion related to federal government and Rs123.6 billion to 
provincial governments. The growth of total expenditure of 15.6 per cent 
during 1995-96 was slightly less than the growth of nominal GDP at 16.5 per 
cent. Federal expenditure increased at 16.7 per cent compared to the 
provincial expenditure which grew at 12.1 per cent. The ratio of 
expenditure to GDP i.e. 22.8 per cent during 1995-96 is marginally lower 
than 23.0 per cent last year.
    
Gross revenue receipts, from tax and non-tax (excluding SAP) were targeted 
at Rs374.5 billion during 1995-96 to meet current as well as development 
expenditure of the federal and provincial governments. These revenues are 
75.6 per cent of the total expenditure during the current year whereas 
current expenditure constitutes 80.5 per cent of total expenditure. Tax 
revenues constitutes 79.9 per cent of total revenues and non-tax revenue 
20.1 per cent. The tax revenues are classified as direct tax and indirect 
tax.
    
Discussing trends in monetary expansion, the survey said the National 
Credit Consultative Council adopted the Annual Credit Plan after it was 
approved by the NEC in its budget meeting held in May 1995. It noted total 
credit expansion of Rs100.49 billion (13.0 %) for 1995-96. Of this, 
domestic credit expansion was targeted at Rs114.24 billion (15.0%) while a 
contraction in net foreign assets of Rs13.75 billion was projected in view 
of a large trade gap. Of this main constituents of domestic credit, Rs30.00 
billion had been earmarked for budgetary support, Rs5 billion for commodity 
operations, Rs3 billion for five autonomous bodies and Rs64.24 billion for 
private sector. In addition to the budgetary support of Rs30 billion, 
financing to the extent of Rs12 billion was clubbed with the government 
sector out of sale proceeds of PTC vouchers. No separate provision was made 
for public sector enterprises.
    
On foreign economic assistance, the survey said that the country had been 
faced with inadequacy of domestic capital to meet its development 
requirements as is reflected in persistent saving - investment gap. To 
bridge this gap, it has been relying on foreign economic assistance since 
early 1950s. It has been estimated that total commitments of public and 
public guaranteed medium and long-term loans and grants would add up to 
56.1 billion dollars by 30th June 1996.
    
Out of this, 44.7 billion dollars are likely to have been disbursed. The 
disbursed amount would comprise loans amounting to 34.8 billion dollars and 
grants worth 9.9 billion dollars, while repayment are estimated at 14.0 
billion dollars.

<a name="trad">Trade imbalance shoots up to $3bn during 11 months</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 11: Pakistans trade imbalance in the last 11 months has shot 
up to almost $3 billion mainly because of sluggish growth, less than six 
per cent, in exports and 15 per cent rise in import bill.
    
Trade deficit during July 1995 to May 1996 represents a rise of about $1 
billion over the trade imbalance suffered in the same period of 1994-95 
when it amounted to a little over $2 billion.
    
Figures of international trade revealed that exports during the last eleven 
months fetched $7.56 billion showing a growth of 5.84 per cent over export 
earnings of $7.15 billion realised during July 1994 to May 1995 period.
    
Import bill during the last eleven months went up to $10.56 billion, up by 
14.78 per cent, over $9.20 billion import bill in the same period of last 
fiscal year.
    
As the trends indicate, total exports till end of June would hardly touch 
$8.3 to $8.4 billion and would be short by over $800 million of the $9.2 
billion officially fixed export target for 1995-96.
    
Exports in May amounted to $837.29 million and are likely to remain more or 
less at the same level in June. Import bill during 1995-96 is expected to 
exceed $11.5 billion as imports during May were worth $998.41 million and 
is expected to be about $1 billion in June and trade imbalance would exceed 
$3 billion mark to match trade gap reflected during 1992-93.
    
More than $900 million have been contributed by two primary commodities 
which are cotton and rice in the export earnings of the current fiscal 
year.
    
Cotton export till May this year fetched $500.46 million, showing a growth 
of more than 1000 per cent. Export of rice fetched about $400 million in 
the current fiscal year so far.

On the import side, the striking feature is the import bill of edible items 
which now amounts to $1.5 billion and would exceed $2 billion till the end 
of June.

Machinery import is worth $2.21 billion, showing an insignificant growth of 
6 per cent, petroleum products $1.34 billion, showing a rise of 34 per 
cent, chemicals $1.91 billion, a rise of over 40 per cent, motor vehicles 
$401.26 million, synthetic yarn $52.79 million and synthetic fibre $115.42 
million.

<a name="61pe">6.1 percent growth rate seen in 1995-96</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, June 10: The Economic Survey of Pakistan, a pre-budget document 
which depicts in numbers the economic gains and losses made by the country 
in the outgoing year has portrayed a picture of mixed trends for 1995-96, 
according to provisional estimates contained in this years document to be 
released.
    
The overall growth rate which was targeted to grow at the rate of 6.5 per 
cent during the year is said to have recorded a growth rate of 6.1 per cent 
which is better than last years achievement of 4.8 per cent.
    
The significant improvement in the overall growth rate compared to last 
years is the result of a dramatic increase in the production of raw 
cotton; and the failure to achieve the target set for the year on the other 
hand has been attributed to slower growth in transport & communications, 
banking & insurance and public administration.
    
The rate of inflation which was targeted to slow down to 9.5 per cent in 
1995-96 from the previous years 13 per cent, however, lingered between 10 
and 11 per cent.
    
The total investment increased from 18.7 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 19.6 
per cent of GDP in 1995-96 of which private sector fixed investment has 
increased from 8.9 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 9.9 per cent of GDP this 
year. In the manufacturing sector, investment has increased by 40 per cent. 
Similarly, foreign direct investment increased to nearly 700 million 
dollars compared to nearly 400 million dollars last year.
    
The exports which were projected to increase by 16 per cent to 9.1 billion 
dollars could improve by only about 10.4 per cent during the year at over 8 
billion dollars, but less than 9 billion dollars. Imports at 11 billion 
dollars on the other hand shot up by over 15 per cent against the projected 
growth of 9.2.
    
As a result, the trade account deficit which was projected at nearly 2 
billion dollars is likely to expand to nearly three billion dollars. Since 
remittances also fell to 1.7 billion dollars from last years nearly 2 
billion dollars, the current account deficit projected at 2.8 billion 
dollars is expected to go much beyond three billion dollars against 
previous years achievement of 2.4 billion dollars.
    
The country is still in the transitional phase of reforms. The cost of 
structural adjustments in certain areas is still outweighing the gains 
expected from such adjustments. These costs including very low per capita 
income growth and higher inflation during the last two years at times, have 
imposed compulsions constraining the pace of structural adjustment. During 
1995-96, such compulsions led to slowing down the pace of fiscal deficit 
reduction as well as tariff reduction.
    
The budget for 1995-96 had envisaged a reduction in overall fiscal deficit 
from 5.6 per cent of GDP in 1994-95 to 5 per cent in 1995-96. This 
improvement was expected with new taxation measures of Rs17 billion. 
Furthermore, receipts from privatisation of public sector enterprises were 
to offset the outstanding national debt, thereby reducing the interest 
payment liabilities. In November 1995 some corrective measures were carried 
out to further improve the fiscal position by another Rs. 15 billion and 
the target for overall fiscal deficit was revised downward to Rs98.9 per 
cent ,i.e. 4.6 per cent of GDP.
    
However, by the end of the year the projected fiscal deficit had to be 
revised back to 5 per cent due mainly to a significant increase in non-
development expenditures and equally significant decline in revenue 
collection. And in view of the fact that by mid-May the borrowing for 
budget had shot past the whole year target by Rs40 billion, the overall 
fiscal deficit is expected to be over 5 per cent but less than last years 
figure of 5.6 per cent.

<a name="sbpm">SBP may withdraw special reserve requirements</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, June 8: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Governor Dr Muhammad Yaqub 
indicated on Saturday the SBP may withdraw the additional reserve 
requirement provided the commercial banks do not expand their advances 
recklessly.
    
Dr Yaqub indicated he might consider withdrawal of the requirement once 
the banks assure him they would not misuse it, a local bank chief told 
Dawn after attending a meeting of all 41 commercial banks at the SBP head 
office.
    
The meeting chaired by Dr Yaqub also reached a consensus on maintaining a 
certain level of foreign currency deposits throughout the year to prevent 
any crisis-like situation.
    
Currently banks maintain 33.5 per cent of their time and demand liabilities 
with the SBP as mandatory reserve including the additional 3.5 per cent. 
The SBP pay the banks a return of around 13 per cent per annum on the 
additional reserves but the bankers say they can get a higher return on 
their funds in the market.
    
Dr. Yaqub underlined and we recognised the need for developing a mechanism 
to ensure it, said a foreign bank chief adding no specifics were 
discussed. The two bankers refused to be quoted. They said the SBP 
governor announced he would soon start holding separate meetings with 
individual banks as a follow-up of the Saturday meeting.
    
Sources privy to the meeting said the SBP chief lamented that excessive 
credit expansion had resulted in a drawdown of foreign exchange reserves. 
They said the governor linked it to the excessive government borrowing for 
budgetary support that according to him had already reached Rs 74 billion 
mark more than twice the target of Rs 28 billion set for 1995/96. They 
quoted the SBP chief as saying that monetary expansion stood at 12.2 
percent as on May 23 due to these reasons.

<a name="300m">300 more items to come under Sales Tax net</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, June 8: As many as 300 additional items will be brought in the 
Sales Tax net following the withdrawal of exemptions in the next budget. 
   
This will result in full coverage of Sales Tax at the import and 
manufacturing stages for commodities numbering 830 in all. In addition, all 
fixed Sales Tax schemes will be withdrawn from July 1, 1996.
    
Informed sources said that most of the additional revenues amounting to Rs. 
40 billion which the Prime Minister the other day said her government 
proposes to mobilise through the next budget will come from the non-
cascading Sales Tax head.
    
The receipt of Sales Tax has shown tremendous buoyancy during the last five 
years as it more than doubled from Rs. 20.79 billion in 1991-92 to nearly 
Rs. 45 billion this year, according to provisional estimates.
    
During the last five years percentage share of Sales Tax in total 
collection increased from 15 per cent to over 20 per cent and in indirect 
taxes from 20 per cent to 30 per cent.
    
In 1993-94 there were 23, 572 registered units in the country paying Sales 
Tax. During 1994-95 the registered units increased to 32,234 or up by 37 
per cent as compared to the preceding year. The figures for the current 
year are still being compiled.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 8: Minister for Commerce, Chaudhry Ahmad Mukhtar has 
favoured trade with India and said under the Marakish Accord, Pakistan 
would have to offer the status of Most Favoured Nation(MFN) to New Delhi. 
He said India could be given MFN status in the next few months.

He said, Pakistan had an international commitment to fulfil to offer this 
MFN status to India. He said the government had in principle agreed to 
offer MFN to India and to have meaningful bilateral trade. But it was still 
studying the likely practical impact of opening trade with its giant 
neighbour. The report is not yet finalised, he said, adding that it could 
be ready by August.
    
We are carrying out studies in different sectors, the engineering sector, 
the agriculture sector, and then we have narrowed the sectors in which we 
play a very major role and once the report comes back on these studies then 
we will be able to finally decide granting of this status, Mukhtar added.

<a name="stoc">Stocks recover on strong covering purchases</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, June 12: After initial steep decline on panic selling spurred by 
news of heavy taxes of Rs 40 billion in the new budget, stocks recovered 
before the closing well on strong covering purchases at the lower levels.
    
The recovery was led by the pivotals, notably PTC vouchers and Hub-Power, 
who encountered massive selling early and then attracted buying at the 
lower levels.
    
At one stage the KSE 100-share index was down by 35 points, breaking the 
barrier of 1,700-point but managed to finish above the psychological 
barrier thanks to late covering purchases.
    
The index was last quoted at 1,706.58 points as compared to previous 
1,715.01, showing net decline of 8.43 points.
    
Bulk of the alternate bouts of buying and selling remained confined to PTC 
vouchers, which because of its size has a weightage of about 20 per cent in 
the KSE 100-share index and any either-way movement in its share value is 
well-reflected in the behaviour of the index.
    
It was massively traded owing to a tussle between some leading foreign 
investors after the news of its securitisation through a foreign bank but 
buyers finally dominated the scene as they covered positions at the lower 
levels.
    
A massive activity of about 29m shares in a single session for any share 
was said to be a record in the recent past as it demonstrates its liquid 
position and investors' willingness to play on both sides of the fence.

Nestle Milkpak added another Rs 10 to its overnight rise of Rs 8, making 
the total in the two pre-budget sessions to Rs 18 apparently for some good 
news.
    
Siemens followed it, which also scored a fresh gain of Rs 10 adding to the 
previous gains of Rs 5 on news that engineering industry might get some 
incentives in the budget to boost exports.
    
Some of the pharma shares followed them under the lead of Sandoz Pakistan 
and Recitt and Colman on an identical news. Both rose appreciably.
    
Other good gainers were led by Rafhan Maize, Gatron Industries, Singer 
Pakistan, Lever Brothers, and Al-Abid Silk, which posted gains ranging from 
Rs 2 to 5.
    
Prominent losers were led by Dewan Salman, Nishat Mills, Mustehkam Cement, 
PSO, and Packages, falling by Rs 2 to 5, the biggest decline of being in 
PIC.
    
Other losers included Burshane Pakistan, Pakistan Refinery, Shell Pakistan, 
PTC vouchers, Engro Chemicals, and Highnoon, which suffered fall to the 
extent of one rupee to Rs 1.75.
    
It was in this background that Gauhar Engineering made debut at the face 
value of Rs 10 and steadily rose to finish the day at Rs 13, showing a gain 
of Rs 3 on volume of 2,500 shares.
    
On the corporate front, the directors of United Insurance company have 
announced cash dividend at the rate of five per cent for the year ended Dec 
31, 1995.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, off Rs 1.15 on 28.600m, 
followed by Hub-Power, lower 40 paisa on 12.431m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, 
easy 30 paisa on 1.627m, Dewan Salman, off Rs 2.35 on 1.245m, Lucky cement, 
up 30 paisa on 1.311m, Dhan Fibre, lower 20 paisa on 0.521m, and LTV 
Modaraba, unchanged on 0.231m shares.
    
Trading volume rose further to 49.367m shares from the previous 42.829m 
shares owing to large business in pivotals.
    
There were 312 actives, out of which 145 shares fell, while 87 rose, with 
80 holding on to the last levels.

IMMIGRATION TO CANADA
A DAWN Special Report: June 18, 1996.


In May 1995, DAWN, Pakistan's most widely circulated English newspaper, 
published a Special Report on Immigration to Canada. This feature was 
intended to provide an insight into the essentials of the subject for the 
readers who aspire to migrate to the country but lack the necessary 
information required to give them an idea of what is involved in the 
immigration process.

As expected, the above feature received a tremendous response from our 
readers and was considered one of the most comprehensive sources of 
information on the subject. As a result, immigration consultants from other 
parts of the world including Australia and New Zealand, stepped up their 
efforts to reach a larger audience through DAWN and provide relevant 
information which was previously limited to only a handful of prospective 
immigrants.

Following the success and constant demand for up-to-date information on the 
subject,  DAWN plans to publish another Special Report on Immigration to 
Canada. The upcoming feature would provide and update of immigration 
procedures, amendments, if any, in the legal process as well as 
advertisements and editorial coverage of the services provided by various 
immigration consultants and advisors.

DAWN is read throughout Pakistan and enjoys nation-wide influence. Its 
circulation stands at over 115,000 copies and its total readership 
exceeds 4,95,000. In view of the contents of the Special Report: 
Immigration to Canada, I believe a presence in the same will be a timely 
opportunity for Canadian immigration consultants and advisors to 
establish their credentials among a precisely targeted audience.

The advertisement costs are as follows:

Full page b/w (432 col cm)		US$5490.00
Half page b/w (216 col cm)		US$2790.00

<a name="herr">Herr Generalfeldmarschall Attiq von Rachmann</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

NO toy soldier he, no desk-top general. He went to war with Slim's 14th 
army. An officer and a gentleman of total integrity was my soldier friend, 
Attiqur Rahman, who died at Lahore on June 1.    

Attiq was the son of Lt Colonel Mohammed Abdur Rahman of the Indian Medical 
Service. Born on June 24, 1918, he was educated at St Paul's School, London 
and at the Indian Military Academy, Dehra Dun, where he was awarded the 
Sword of Honour. Commissioned on February 1, 1940, he joined the 4/12 
Frontier Force Regiment and was posted to Thall, Kurrum (Ahmedzai 
Operations) and then to Datta Khel (Lower Tochi Operations). In November 
1941 his regiment went to join Slim's 14th Army to fight in Burma. Attiq 
saw action at Moulmein on the Salween River, at the Sittang River, at the 
Siege of Imphal and was awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous bravery 
in the face of the enemy. He was sent back to India and put through the 
Staff College at Quetta and just before the war's end returned to Burma as 
DDA/QMG 33 Brigade, with 7 Division at Waw. Come to the end of the war, he 
was posted to the Indian Military Academy as an Instructor (GSO-2).
     
In 1947, with the birth of Pakistan (Army number PA 103) he was sent as 
Chief Instructor to the newly formed Pakistan Military Academy, Kakul. 
After that he was given command of his own regiment, the 4 FFR, until in 
1950 he was sent to the Command and General Staff College, Fort 
Ldeavonworth, USA. He returned to Pakistan in 1951 to command 101 Brigade. 
Back to Quetta in 1952 to do a couple of 'old boy' courses at the staff 
College, after which he stayed on as Deputy Commandant. 1956 saw him 
commanding 53 Brigade in Comilla (East Pakistan) and later that year he was 
posted to GHQ first as DMO and then as VCGS.

In 1959, he was given command of 15 Division, then of 7 Division. He did 
the Imperial Defence College (London) course in 1962, and came back to GHQ 
in 1963 as AG. During the 1965 war, he was posted to HQ-1 Corps, and later 
given command of 12 Division. In 1966, promoted to Lieutenant General, he 
commanded his firs Corps, 4 Corps at Multan. He later moved to 1 Corps, and 
come 1969 and Yahya's Martial Law he was appointed MLA and Governor West 
Pakistan. With the break-up of One Unit in 1971, he took over as Governor 
of Punjab. He retired from the army and from the governorship in December 
1971. 

As Colonel Commandant of the Frontier Force Regiment and as Colonel of the 
6 FFR and the 27 FFR, during his retirement he devoted much time to the 
welfare of his regiment and its men. It was during his early retirement 
that he wrote and published seven books on matters military. In 1977, Zia 
pulled him out of retirement and persuaded him to take over as Chairman of 
the Federal Public Service Commission, a position he held with distinction 
until 1985 (interestingly, his father, before coming to Pakistan, had 
headed the Public Services Commission of the Nizam's Hyderabad).     

When Ahmed Jaffer, Attiq's great friend and tennis partner, died in 1987, 
he succeeded him as President of the English Speaking Union of Pakistan.

I got to know him better when he became Chairman of the FPSC, and visited 
Karachi frequently. I awaited his visits with joy, for we had a lot of fun 
together, always laughing and joking, mostly at our-selves, and exchanging 
strange anecdotes of our varying experiences in life.

My other good friend and neighbour Admiral Ahsan, was alive in those days 
(he died in 1989) and whenever the three of us met the conversation in one 
form or another centred around the loss of East Pakistan. Attiq was, during 
those dreadful days preceding the final split, Governor of West Pakistan 
and Ahsan Governor of the East Wing. None of us had any doubts in our mind 
as to which selfish self-centred blackguard was truly responsible for the 
loss of half our country.

But Attiq's first and prime interest was World War 1, the subject he 
preferred reading about above all others, and on which he was extremely 
knowledgeable. He would discourse at length and with passion on the 
awfulness of the battles of the Somme, of Paschendaele, of Ypres, of Arras 
and of Cambrai. WW2, in which he had fought, of course, also occupied hours 
of his reading time. He greatly admired the German army commanders, above 
all, Field Marshal Erich von Manstein.

Dinners at my house were a ritual. Always, but always, a minute before the 
prescribed time, precisely at 2029, my dogs would bark to announce Attiq's 
arrival. My mother enjoyed the company of the two old warriors with their 
old-time manners. The way they greeted her, the way they addressed her, 
their conversation, all took her back to the good old days when men were 
gentlemen. At one of  these dinners we decided that Lieutenant-General was 
too curt a title for Attiq, and that henceforth he would be known as 'Herr 
Generalfeldmarschall Attiq von Rachmann' and to complement which tall Ahsan 
(who had, during the Arakan campaign, won his DSC at sea) would bear the 
title 'Grossadmiral von Ahsan.'

I was most keen that both these friends of mine, with their distinguished 
careers, holding high crucial office as they did at the saddest time in the 
country's history, should publish what they knew of the betrayals, the 
sordid deals, the wicked coercive powers, and all that led to the fall of 
East Pakistan. Ahsan said he would not, for if he were to write the truth 
as he knew it, he would hurt many that were still living and many relatives 
of those that were dead: He remained adamant, despite our protestations 
that he was denying history.   

Attiq did write his biography, which I had the great pleasure and the 
honour of publishing in 1989. Ahsan wrote the Foreword, from which I quote: 

Back to the Pavilion is a scintillating account of the life of an 
outstanding military leader of our times, adept at the use of pen as well 
as sword, with friendship for all and malice for none. Attiq is a fine 
example of courage, modesty and self-denial. Quite unconsciously, perhaps, 
he has always lived in accordance with the words inscribed on the walls of 
the Indian Military Academy at Dehra Dun: 'The safety, honour and welfare 
of your country comes first, always and every time. the honour, welfare and 
comfort of the men you command next. Your own ease, comfort and safety come 
last, always and every time.' Here is a totally honourable Army 
officer'..."

Apart from all this, Attiq had a delightful sense of humour and was always 
game for a bit of horseplay. On one occasion when he arrived in Karachi on 
an FPSC visit, Amina Jilani (who had known him well since she was a child) 
and I went to meet him at the airport armed with a large red and black 
swastika on a very long pole. We grandly walked into the VIP room, 
satisfying the security men that we were there to greet our 'Leader.' A 
very apparent 'agency' man sidled up and asked, "Of which party?" The 
Pakistan People's Liberal Nazi Socio Democratic Communist Front, the 
alarmed spook was told. Attiq stoically smiling, didn't turn a hair. He 
played along.    

On the last visit he was able to make to Karachi, for an ESU meeting in 
November 1995, we took a drummer and a trumpeter to the airport with 
instructions that they play a military march as he emerged from the arrival 
lounge. They assured us they could play 'Colonal Bogey', but we failed to 
confirm their familiarity with military music and what greeted Attiq was a 
Punjabi wedding tune.

As for these two photographs, on one occasion to prove that all army men 
are 'pongos', I handed the photo of Hesky Baig receiving the Sword of 
Honour at Dehra Dun in 1936 to Attiq, and to Hesky I handed Attiq's photo 
taken in 1939, and asked them to tell me which was which. Neither was able 
to say. can any of my readers spot the difference? 

How I will miss the Generalfeldmarschall.

<a name="rich">Rich and poor, were all in this together</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto

LATER this month, the leaders of the Group of Seven  the seven most 
economically and militarily advanced nations  will sit down at the same 
table in Lyon, France. These powerful heads of state have many concerns, 
but their main focus should be the nations without seats at the table.
    
The G-7 countries need to figure out what they can do to ensure a stable 
world, not only politically, but economically and socially. Why? If the 
current gap between the wealthy few and the disadvantaged many continues to 
grow, the whole world will suffer.
    
Despite temporary economic difficulties, the G-7 nations are enjoying 
unprecedented prosperity. This prosperity has been accompanied by a growing 
indifference toward less prosperous nations, however. The upcoming meeting 
in Lyon is a perfect opportunity for the haves of the globe to demonstrate 
their willingness to assist the have-nots. Through their words and actions, 
they can make a real difference in the lives of millions.
    
The troubles of the have-nots are great: too many countries lack resources, 
are mired in deep debt and have high levels of malnutrition. Other problems 
include low levels of medical care, illiteracy, no access to clean drinking 
water and no system of sewage, sanitation and drainage.
    
Here in Pakistan, for example, I was horrified when, just after I became 
prime minister, I discovered that many major hospitals in our cities had no 
human-waste disposal systems. Hospitals lacked specialised care centers, 
such as burn units, which could have saved countless lives. Many died for 
want of proper medical care.
    
We know what our problems are and we know what we must do to overcome them 
 but too often, we dont have the money required to meet our goals. 
Despite our best efforts, our countrys debt leaves very little room for 
human investment. The governments total income is 278 billion rupees. Of 
that, we spend 187 billion rupees on debt repayment alone. Thats 67 per 
cent of our budget!
    
The golden years of the oil boom and foreign aid during the Afghan freedom 
struggle have faded away. Pakistan now has to stand on its own feet, but it 
is not an easy task. I have no doubt our people will rise to the challenge.
    
But even our best efforts for years to come will leave too little for 
investment in social infrastructure and programmes to eradicate poverty... 
too little to spend on our women and children... to little for our future.
    
These are the types of problems that the G-7 nations need to address in 
their upcoming meeting. They should look at the example set by the 
Scandinavian nations, which allot 1 per cent of their gross national 
product for assistance to developing countries. The Scandinavians have a 
truly global and humanitarian outlook to their foreign policy  an outlook 
the G-7 nations would do well to follow.
    
French President Jacques Chirac, chair of the Lyon conference, is a man of 
immense understanding and great experience. I believe he understands the 
importance of reducing the gap between rich and poor, so I urge him to 
spearhead a drive to renew the G-7 pledge to devote at least 0.7 per cent 
of the member nations GNP to developing-country assistance.
    
Another way the wealthy of the world can assist the developing countries is 
through mutually beneficial trade. I applaud the recent efforts of the G-7 
nations to open global markets to the fruits of developing nations labour. 
Easier access to the markets of more affluent countries will give a welcome 
boost to the trade balance of developing nations, allowing them to purchase 
more of the sophisticated products that G-7 nations are so adept at 
producing.
    
Now is not the time to introduce new conditions to enforce the social 
standards of the western world. These standards are made possible by 
prosperity  and if developing nations are not given a chance to attain 
that prosperity, they wont be able to achieve those standards.
    
In this time of opportunity, when the ideological divisions of the cold war 
have ended, our responsibilities are in direct proportion to our abilities. 
We should all do our part in a new partnership for development and peace 
 a partnership that embraces not only East and West, but North and South.
    
So, as the great leaders of the world gather around the table in Lyon, they 
can send a powerful message to the developing world: Were all in this 
together.

<a name="poli">Politics of corruption</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi

IN politics the only issue that is receiving maximum attention is the 
question of corruption, especially in high places. The daily exchange of 
accusations between the government and opposition in every assembly and on 
the platform is the stuff of much of daily politics.
    
Newspapers are full of it, both as news and comment. A lot of pontification 
is being done on the subject. This is so in many other countries also, 
especially neighbouring India. However, the issue should be seen in some 
perspective. Hard-headed practical people and pessimists among students of 
human behaviour assert that some corruption was always there and will 
always be there. Any conventional analysis of decision-making would show 
that some degree of discretion among officers of the state at many levels 
has necessarily to be permitted.
    
It is impossible to constantly to supervise everyone in taking the 
necessary decisions or made to explain in detail every single decision 
taken. Wherever there is discretion, there is the scope for misuse of 
authority. Other things being equal, instances of corruption would 
correspond to the cultural and educational level of the society: it is a 
question of how permissive that society is of those who compromise their 
rectitude without enough opprobrium or whether the educational and cultural 
milieu of the society discourages greed and lack of integrity in 
individuals and places premium on rectitude in private and public affairs 
alike. We have to look inwards.
    
Cries of corruption were loud and shrill from the very beginning in this 
country. Extraordinarily harsh laws were framed in the earliest years of 
independence and extensively used. The propaganda against politicians for 
being both corrupt and inefficient has been long and persistent. Indeed 
there are reasons to believe that there were certain unseen powers that 
organised regular vilification campaigns against all (civilian) 
politicians. No doubt, not all of it lacked a basis in fact, though most 
facts of corruption under military and authoritarian regimes go undisclosed 
and unpublicised because the Press is prevented from airing such facts.
    
A credible presumption can be made that the level of corruption during 
unaccountable authoritarian regimes could only be higher  by virtue of 
being unaccountable. At one remove, our very folklore include plenty of 
stories that show what can only fall under the category of corruption. The 
civilisation as it grew on the subcontinent always included some corruption 
in public affairs, even if the standards of morality in individual lives in 
ancient times can be romanticised.
    
The question arises why people show so much shock and disbelief when there 
is actual social acceptance of those who accumulate wealth through 
obviously corrupt means  well above their station in life. In fact 
possession of wealth is now virtually a justification of its own self, with 
no questions being asked about the means adopted except when there is some 
motivation to denigrate that person. Have people become generally more 
naive?
    
Also if we look around, the incidence of corruption in the society is so 
widespread that almost all are ready to offer bribes, usually petty, to any 
government functionary to get their jobs done  not necessarily getting 
something illegal done. That would involve more than petty bribes. The 
things have come to such a pass that even for getting lawful things done by 
a common man, some amount of bribery has now become necessary. Indeed, a 
clerk in the Customs House once told the writer when queried over the 
informal fee for stamping the entry number on a Bill of Entry (for personal 
luggage): my salary is just Rs.; do you think I can live on it; I treat 
this salary as merely the payment for coming and going to the Customs 
House; if you want me to stamp the number, pay me a fee that will sustain 
me. The point is why should people be so prudish about such a prevalent 
thing.
    
There are good reasons to believe that most major decisions and deals in 
recent years during different governments tenure were made in which the 
element of bribes could not have been absent. Should anyone now assert that 
a particular contract was awarded without kickbacks, it would raise more 
eyebrows than a contrary assertion would. Such is the prevalent level of 
corruption which in real life is the accepted thing. Why else would it be 
so prevalent?
    
The question remains. Why so obsessive interest in corruption is being 
shown by our political class which has become its daily preoccupation, one 
way or another? One less-emphasised aspect needs to be noted. It cannot be 
without significance that this overemphasis on corruption is serving to 
hide a large number of hard and real problems facing the public life that 
should be a matter of far greater interest to the citizens. Are not common 
Pakistanis facing serious economic hardships because of high and persistent 
inflation for such a long period? Is unemployment not assuming alarming 
proportions? Every single service the state is (was) providing has gravely 
deteriorated in quality and is fast diminishing in quantity also even as 
its cost goes on escalating. Should that or should not that subject be 
discussed?
    
The globalisation and free market policies, recommended by the multilateral 
agencies, have brought excruciating pain during the implementation of 
supposed reforms; should this not be widely discussed and more 
meaningfully? Pakistans sovereignty, especially in economic matters, seems 
to have gone for a Burton; the economy is virtually bankrupt and its credit 
rating in the world is less than desired. Is this being adequately debated? 
Clouds of war keep lowering between Pakistan and India and yet the 
politicos have little else on their mind than corruption. Is that not 
strange?
    
It is not that one does not wish to contain the corruption phenomenon. Nor 
is it a fact that familiarity should breed de facto acceptance, thought it 
seems to be happening. Only, one merely wishes to keep the perspective 
straight: let us realise that fighting corruption is a long-term 
proposition and the more gimmicks are resorted to for cosmetically 
containing it the more it spreads. Look at the past instances: whenever 
more anti- corruption laws were made and more anti-corruption departments 
set up the more corruption grew. The process is well known. The political 
accountability process has invariably been misused for political purposes  
another facet of secondary corruption.
    
The point being made here is that the overemphasis on corruption serves as 
a shabby political manoeuvre: it is intended to shift attention from the 
problems that are crying to high heavens for attention. It is also a right-
wing nostrum  a variant of the politics of God and country or its other, 
later version: clean and efficient government with the proviso that 
this or that saviour will, by virtue of his being more clean, inaugurate a 
veritable Wallahala. Let us guard against making corruption an all-
absorbing obsession to hide other and uglier facts of national life. Let us 
think and do something about corruption by all means. But do let us be 
honest with facts and explanations. The problem should be approached in a 
proper, scientific frame of mind  and not for making a political ballyhoo.
    
Corruption will begin being contained when the products of our schools, 
colleges, institutes, universities will possess a character and integrity 
and who are habitually truthful, law- abiding and cannot bring themselves 
to offer or accept bribes or do or accept undue favours. In their cases, 
their parents, spiritual and cultural influences and teachers will have 
done their duty by making them recognise the happiness that comes from 
pursuing higher values: human freedoms, truth, common weal and the desire 
to leave the world a bit better than one initially found. Goodness and 
rectitude cannot be forced on human beings  only hypocrisy can be or at 
least encouraged easily.

<a name="lost">Lost in cyberspace</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

FOR a country that professes daily that it wants to catch up with the rest 
of the world, successive governments have been doing everything they can to 
make that task an impossible one.
    
Take the Internet revolution that has taken the world by storm as an 
example. Here is an inexpensive and accessible way of communicating with 
people around the world, accessing all kinds of information and being 
entertained without moving out of your home or office. Millions of people 
are using this exciting new technology for business and pleasure, and it is 
expected that the Net will alter the way computers are used and how we work 
within the next few years.
    
When faced with the tremendous opportunities offered by this global 
network, what does the government do? It effectively slams the door shut. 
While the government is talking about software export, the Pakistan 
Telecommunication Corporation has retained its stranglehold on data 
transmission. Digicom, the only Internet server in the country, cannot 
accept more subscribers because it is not being given any more telephone 
lines. At the same time, PTCs few dedicated lines remain mostly 
unavailable. So effectively, PTC has virtually stifled on-line, real-time 
Internet access.
    
For readers who are not plugged-in to what is happening out there in 
cyberspace, let me quickly sketch the contours of things to come. 
Basically, the Internet is a vast, autonomous network of computers that 
communicate with each other over telephone lines. Thus, sitting in Karachi, 
I can access libraries and databases in America, order books from London, 
and chat with my son who is studying in Los Angeles. In most other 
countries, charges for this digital globetrotting are nominal, and even 
Digicom in Pakistan bills you around a hundred rupees an hour. The catch, 
of course, is that lines are not available.
    
Think about the possibilities of this breakthrough for a minute: much of 
the worlds vast store of information is now instantaneously available to 
us no matter where we live. Students, scientists and journalists can now 
tap into reference works, journals and newspapers in countries around the 
world. Similarly, Pakistanis and foreigners can now read this newspaper 
from wherever they are. Already, you can shop in electronic malls by 
simply browsing through the contents on your computer screen and ordering 
whatever you wish by punching in your credit card number. More and more 
people are working at home and sending and receiving documents to and from 
their offices.
    
But this is not a column about the changes being wrought by the Internet; 
rather, it is about our reaction to it. Instead of propagating this 
technology and making it as widely available as possible in schools, 
colleges and laboratories, PTC has restricted its use by the simple 
expedient of limiting the number of telephone lines that can be dedicated 
to the Net. Basically, access is affordable only when a carrier obtains 
bulk rates which he can then pass on to subscribers. Ideally, entrepreneurs 
who use their own satellite links to make lines available as well as 
transmit data electronically on a commercial basis have made it possible 
for million to plug in. But here, a government monopoly refuses to permit 
the private sector a toe-hold in the market while it does nothing to give 
people access itself. This dog-in- the-manger attitude is depriving us of 
the opportunity to surf the Net.
    
By its very nature, the Internet is a decentralised, anarchic network that 
has caught the major players in the computer world by surprise by its 
popularity and exponential growth. Belatedly, hardware and software 
manufacturers are scrambling to keep up with its rapid evolution. 
Typically, most governments are uneasy with the fact that no one person or 
organisation controls it: the Net has acquired a life and tempo of its own. 
You either keep up or get left behind. The problem in Pakistan is 
compounded by the fact that those making policy have no idea about the 
scale or potential of the Net. They have probably not surfed it themselves, 
and do not have the intellectual curiosity to attempt a glimpse into the 
future. And yet, despite this ostrich-like attitude, government spokesman 
never tire of announcing the intention of becoming an Asian tiger, and of 
soon becoming a major software exporter. India is already exporting a 
billion dollars worth of software a year, mostly to the United States. But 
the authorities there have shown more foresight by permitting exporters to 
set up their own satellite links.
    
One of the concerns of authorities everywhere is about the possibility of 
the electronic transmission of pornographic material. Every medium is open 
to this misuse. Should we stop printing because the printing press can be 
used to produce smut? Ban all cinema and videos? The sad truth is that 
there is a widespread fascination  occasionally bordering on the perverse 
 in sex. But we cannot stop communicating because any medium can be used 
and abused for pornographic purposes.
    
Another unstated fear of the government here is that messages and 
information on the Internet are virtually instantaneous and therefore not 
subject to censorship. While this is equally true for fax messages, at 
least intelligence agencies can get a copy by tapping a particular line. 
This is much harder on the Internet. But surely a new and vital technology 
cannot be kept out simply because it is difficult to keep tabs on.
    
In his recent book Power Shift, Alvin Tofler has made the point that 
recent advances in computer technology have made it easier for developing 
countries to catch up. But by severely limiting access to the Internet, PTC 
is ensuring that we get left even further behind. This is the same 
compulsion that has impelled successive governments to try and brainwash us 
by controlling the electronic media. And while the Information Ministry has 
not been able to stop us from seeing and hearing the truth on CNN, BBC and 
Zee TV, it has done its worst by sending its dancing squares to block out 
offending sights on the foreign news broadcast locally by NTM. As pointed 
out by a columnist in these columns a fortnight ago, this kind of asinine 
contortions fools nobody, and succeeds only in revealing the uncertainty 
and paranoia of the government.
    
While I am not plugged into the Internet, I do have e-mail, and it has 
become a pleasure bordering on habit to check my computer every morning for 
mail from my son. I fill him in on what is happening here, and he tells me 
about his life in the United States. In a sense, we have never been closer 
than we are now despite the vast distance that separates us. Although the 
endless possibilities of cyberspace beckon, PTC guards the doors to 
infinity.</pre><hr><pre>

KARACHI, June 9: Pakistan Juniors defeated India 2-1 in a sudden death 
playoff in the final of the Junior Asia Cup hockey tournament at the Delto 
Stadium, Singapore, according to a message faxed to Dawn.
    
The match was played at a brisk pace and both the teams tried hard to gain 
ascendancy.
    
Pakistan opened its account in the 5th minute through a penalty corner 
goal. India was awarded a penalty stroke through a foul by Pakistans full-
back. Centre forward Arbheet Singh netted the goal in the 10th minute and 
levelled the scores 1-1.
    
The Indian players gaining their confidence went ahead 2-1 through their 
centre forward Hasrat Qureshi, who scored from a direct penalty corner hit, 
a lead which India maintained till the breather.
    
Full back Salim Ali netted the second goal for Pakistan after two minutes 
into the second half with a powerful shot from the rival goal-keepers 
rebound to draw abreast 2-2. The players of both teams then raided each 
others goal several times but in vain. Even penalty strokes could not 
break the stalemate as the fate of the match was decided through a sudden 
death.
    
Pakistan then edged out India 2-1 and went on to win the final.
    
Earlier, Japan shocked South Korea 4-1 on a penalty shoot-out and secured 
the third position in the Asia Cup junior hockey tournament.
    
The match was drawn 2-2 and penalty strokes were awarded to decide the fate 
of the encounter.

KARACHI, June 10: Former Olympian Samiullah, new manager of the hockey 
team, after his return from Singapore, said Pakistans target is to win 
back the Atlanta Olympic title and for that we all have to work together 
like one man to come up to the expectation of the nation.
    
Talking to Dawn, Samiullah, called in his hey days as Flying Horse on the 
left flank, said the Pakistan squad is good and capable of meeting the 
challenge successfully in the 12-nation Olympic hockey. The centennial 
Olympic Games will commence on July 19.
    
Managing the Pakistan senior team for the first time, Samiullah, serving in 
the Pakistan Customs, stated our entire efforts should be directed to 
achieving the gold at Atlanta. The time is short and we face testing task 
of overcoming the challenges awaiting us within six weeks time, added the 
former Olympian.
    
I know almost all the players of the Pakistan selected squad. They all also 
know me. We would be finding no communication problems in working out our 
plan to attain laurels and glory for Pakistan, emphasised manager Samiullah 
who tonight joined the team staying at a local hotel.
    
I was immediately informed by the Pakistan Hockey Federation about my 
appointment of manager for the senior team Olympic as well as for the two 
European contests on telephone in Singapore where I was managing the 
juniors team competing in the Juniors Asia Cup, a qualifying round for next 
years juniors World Cup in England.
    
I consider it an honour as well as a challenge as never before I had 
managed the Pakistan seniors team, stated Samiullah.
    
I delayed my departure till Pakistan retained the juniors Asia Cup beating 
India last night and took the first available flight to take up my new 
assignment, said the new manager

<a name="stif">Stiff challenge in European contests: Mansoor</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, June 11: Captain Mansoor Ahmed, with 209 international caps to his 
credit said here today that Pakistan would be facing a tough challenge in 
the six-league matches of the two four-nation hockey tournaments but we are 
confident that we would put up a gallant fight for victory.
    
The other competing teams are reigning Olympic champions Germany, World Cup 
runners-up the Netherlands and host Great Britain, the 1988 Seoul Olympic 
winners.
    
World renowned goalkeeper Mansoor, 29, stated like Pakistan, Germany, the 
Netherlands, are also strong contenders for the Atlanta Olympic gold and 
the coming two tournaments would provide a great opportunity to assess our 
own capabilities and also to overcome our weak points before we launch our 
assault on Atlanta Games, starting there on July 19.
    
He said our target is Atlanta Olympic gold but Pakistans participation in 
the coming tournaments would further help in develop understanding and co-
ordination on the 12 day tour of Europe. Both the tournaments are equally 
important for all the competing teams but for Pakistan it has assumed 
extraordinary importance as 1992 Barcelona Olympic champions Germany is in 
our group at the Atlanta hockey draw, emphasised the skipper.
    
Germanys challenge had always been tough but Pakistan is equally 
determined to face it on the coming twin contests of Europe, as well as in 
Atlanta, he said.
    
The Pakistan team is scheduled to fly tomorrow morning for London and from 
there it will go to Milton Keynes where the first four nation league starts 
on June 13. Pakistan would be getting hardly 20 hours rest before facing 
the Netherlands the next day on June 13. The next match will be against 
Great Britain on June 14. After a days rest the World Cup champions, 
Pakistan, will be up against Olympic gold winners Germany on June 15. The 
second two-nation league starts in Amstelveen (Holland)and Pakistan first 
meets Great Britain on June 19, play against Germany on June 20 and after a 
days rest the green-shirted Pakistanis face hosts the Netherlands on June 
22 before returning home on June 25.

The team is:
    
Goalkeepers: Mansoor Ahmed and Khalid Mahmood
    
Fullbacks: Danish Kalim, Naveed Alam and Rana Mujahid
    
Halfbacks: Mohammad Usman , Mohammad Khalid, Malik Shafqat
     
and Irfan Mahmood. Forwards: Tahir Zaman (vice-captain), Shahbaz Ahmed, 
Mohammad Sarwar, Mohammad Shahbaz, Rahim Khan, Mohammad Anis and Aleem 
Raza.

<a name="shah">Shahbaz drops out of hockey teams European tour</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

KARACHI, June 12: Olympian inside left Shahbaz Ahmed of PIA was bitterly 
critical of the Pakistan Hockey Federation and pulled out of European tour 
of the national team, claiming that present atmosphere was not conducive 
for him as he fears vengeance from the team management.

Addressing a Press conference at a local hotel former Pakistan captain said 
it does not make any difference whether he plays or he does not play in the 
present Pakistan selected team. The Pakistan team , even without me , had 
won the six- nation Atlanta pre-Olympic Tournament , cited Shahbaz an 
example in support of staying back here at the eleventh hour.
    
I feel happy that I am not playing in such an atmosphere as my relations 
with the PHF bosses are very strained. My mother and wife both advised me 
to skip the European tour in the present situation created by the hockey 
establishment, stated Shahbaz Ahmed, under whose captaincy Pakistan had won 
the 1994 Sydney World Cup.
    
Shahbaz, with 230 caps in his belt, expressed his apprehension that he 
might have not been given a fair treatment by the team management whose 
appointment was not made in consultation with seniors players, including 
himself, in the wake of Senate Standing Committee on Sports meeting held in 
Islamabad on June 3 to resolve the hockey crisis.
    
When questioned that the Senate Standing Committee on Sports, so far, has 
made no observation and comment over the naming of the team management and 
other related issues, Shahbaz replied that it has surprised him also.
    
To another question whether he has also opted himself out of the Olympics, 
commencing in Atlanta from July 19, Shahbaz replied that he cannot say it 
just now. I had always played for the countrys honour and glory and acted 
against the medical advice in 1993 when the experts in London medical 
check-up advised me to stop playing for the good of your health he said.
    
The nation wanted my services and I continued to play and Pakistan won back 
the Sydney World Cup in I994, stated the Olympian inside left who captained 
Pakistan for the bronze medal in 1992 Barcelona Games.
    
However when further questioned, in case, the countrys higher authorities 
ask you to reverse your decision as you did last year when you altered your 
retirement decision after winning the World Cup, Shahbaz replied, One has 
to do it.

LAHORE, June 10: Tour Manager of the 17-member England-bound Pakistan 
cricket team, Yawar Saeed, said on Monday that he was totally satisfied 
with the response of the players after his first meeting with them.
    
They were conscious of their responsibilities as ambassadors of Pakistan, 
on-and-off the field and looked confident to fight as a single unit to beat 
England on its soil in the ensuing Tests and one-day international series, 
Saeed said.
    
Talking to this correspondent shorty after the meeting at the Qadhafi 
Stadium, Yawar Saeed said he could not say anything on behalf of the 
Pakistan Cricket  Board (PCB) or the national selectors.
    
However, he had been assigned the task of talking to the 17 cricketers and 
develop an understanding with them so that the team does its best on the 
tour.
    
While replying to a question, the Tour Manager said that the cricketers 
from Karachi will return home on Tuesday (June  11)  evening. The boys 
belonging to Lahore may continue their training here till the departure of 
the team.
    
The 17 cricketers will re-assemble at a five-star hotel in Lahore on the 
evening of June 16 and fly to Amsterdam through a PIA flight on June 17 at 
5-00 am to play two goodwill matches against Holland at The Hague.
    
The team official said that Pakistan cricket team will leave for Birmingham 
from The Hague on June 21.
    
That implies that no change is expected in the England-bound Pakistan team.</pre>
