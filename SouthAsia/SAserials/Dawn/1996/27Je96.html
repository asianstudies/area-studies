Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 21: A government spokesman has denied the news report, 
World Bank cuts aid by half, appearing in  Dawn  (June 19, 1996), 
regarding reduction of assistance from the World Bank and termed it totally 
incorrect.
    
Clarifying the position, the spokesman said that there were two aspects of 
project assistance from the World Bank which were commitments and 
disbursements. Regarding commitments, he said that these were based on 
mutually agreed lending programme which for the year 1994-95 was 911.10 
million dollars as compared to 1.07 billion dollars committed for 1995-96. 
The disbursement received from the World Bank during 1994-95 were 694. 41 
million dollars, and they were 376.67 million dollars up to March 31, 1996.
    
The spokesman further said that disbursement from the Bank funded projects 
once signed did not involve any decision on the part of the Bank. In fact, 
it was contingent upon the ability of the Government of Pakistan to utilise 
foreign assistance. In this regard he said that the support and commitment 
of the World Bank for Pakistan was as strong as before.

<a name="pmre">PM rejects idea of UN control over Kashmir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 22: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Saturday rejected the 
suggestion of giving the disputed Kashmir territory under UN trusteeship 
and said Pakistan fully sticks to its principled stand on the lingering 
problem.
    
I cant subscribe to his views (on Kashmir), she said in reference to the 
proposal of former caretaker prime minister Balkh Sher Mazari that the 
Kashmir state be given to UN trusteeship for five to ten years. Rejecting 
the proposal she said: I have lot of respect for Mr. Mazari but I dont 
know whats he upto? Whom is he favouring and whom he wants to please with 
such suggestions. The prime minister was talking to newsmen after 
attending the National Assembly session where she listened the speeches of 
Mazari and chief of Pukhtoonkhuwa Milli Party Mehmud Khan Achakzai.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

LONDON, June 22: Pakistan is in danger of moving towards anarchy and civil 
strife if its leaders fail to address to its problems with integrity. These 
views were expressed by Mr Shaharyar M. Khan, a former Pakistan foreign 
secretary, who has just completed a two-year assignment with the United 
Nations as its special representative to Rwanda.
    
Speaking at a gathering of the UK-Pakistan Cultural Foundation of which he 
was president when serving as Pakistans High Commissioner to London, Mr 
Khan regretted that the country, during its 50 year life has gone backwards 
in many respects - in literacy, education and in its values. A new 
beginning has to be made. We have to begin from the beginning, he said.
    
Mr Khan considered corruption to be one of the root causes of the decline. 
State corruption, he stressed, corrodes the whole being and one goes 
towards degeneration. It becomes a way of life.
    
With his experience of UN service in Africa, Mr Khan cited the example of 
Zaire, at one time considered to be the jewel in the Belgian Crown, but 
which after a succession of failed and corrupt governments now presents a 
pathetic sight.
    
Mr Khan criticised the lavish expenditure recent governments in Pakistan 
have incurred on trips abroad. 
    
He gave the example of the last years Commonwealth heads of government 
meeting in Auckland, New Zealand, where the Pakistan delegation consisted 
of 73 members when not more than five from each country are allowed in the 
conference hall. 
     
The Pakistan delegation to the UN General Assembly last year consisted of 
103 members when in the past not more than 14 members used to go.
    
Mr. Khan said since he was no more in government service he felt free to 
open his mind on the issues concerning Pakistan. When other countries did 
not indulge in such waste, why did Pakistan do it, he asked. The former 
foreign secretary made a plea for ending privileges and making a society 
full of integrity. He asked the people at the top to set an example. But, 
he added, each one of us has to light the candle of integrity, following in 
the footsteps of the Father of the Nation, Mohammad Ali Jinnah.

RAWALPINDI, June 24: Army was called out in Rawalpindi on Monday to help 
control law and order after two workers of right-wing Jamaat-i-Islami were 
killed and 80 wounded when police opened fire to stop the protesters from 
marching on the Federal Capital.
    
Doctors at Civil Headquarters Hospital, said two people died of bullet 
wounds and 60 were injured including 12 policemen in firing and stone-
pelting around Liaquat Bagh on main Murree Road. The remaining 20 injured 
were taken to Rawalpindi General Hospital and Cantonment Hospital.
    
Troops were called in after clashes and army trucks mounted with machine-
guns were deployed at trouble spots.
    
The federal cabinet which met in Islamabad on Monday decided to hold a 
judicial inquiry into killings.
    
A senior government official said Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held a 
special meeting of the cabinet in the afternoon to consider the Mondays 
events.
    
Doctors at Civil Hospital said that some of the injured were released after 
treatment while others have been admitted. We have received only two 
bodies, a doctor at Casualty Department said. He said Abdus Samad, 26 and 
Muhammad Shafiq, 17, died of bullet wounds.

Information Minister Khalid Kharal told reporters at a briefing in the 
National Assembly that 30 per cent of the protesters were armed. He said 
many veterans of Afghan and Kashmir war participated in the protest.
    
Residents of areas adjacent to Murree Road said police fired hundreds of 
teargas canisters on the main road and adjacent side- lanes where the 
protesters had entered to play hide-and-seek with the police.
    
Jamaat-i-Islami had given a call for staging a sit-in in front of the Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhuttos office in the federal capital and asked its 
workers to gather at Liaquat Bagh for the march.
    
Since early morning police blocked the Murree Road and other roads leading 
to Islamabad by trawler-trucks, tractors, erecting temporary barricades and 
laying barbed wires. No vehicle was allowed to enter Islamabad or 
Rawalpindi since morning due to which attendance in government offices 
remained thin.

<a name="reac">Reactionaries conspiring to uproot democracy: PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 25: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto asserted that reactionary 
forces had once again joined hands to uproot democracy and put the country 
on the path of fundamentalism. These forces are against the parliamentary 
form of democracy and want to establish the presidential form of government 
or dictatorship, she declared while talking to reporters in the National 
Assembly cafeteria.
    
Ms Bhutto alleged that these anti-democratic forces had used the army, 
the constitution and the presidency for achieving their objectives in the 
past, but this time they were trying to use some other institutions as 
the armed forces were performing their duties in accordance with the 
constitution, presidency was not available for hatching conspiracies 
against an elected government and the Eighth Amendment had been rendered 
ineffective.
    
She claimed that these reactionary forces wanted to put Pakistan on the 
track of fundamentalism, but declared that her government was committed not 
to allow anyone to use Pakistans soil against any brotherly country. She 
pointed out that her government had already signed extradition treaties 
with Algeria, Egypt, Afghanistan, France and Maldives to fight terrorism 
and it was on this account that Ramzi Yousuf had been extradited to the 
United States and a number of Arab terrorists expelled from Pakistan.
    
They (the so-called reactionary forces) are opposed to all these measures 
taken by the government and know that they cannot achieve their nefarious 
designs if the PPP remains in power, she said.
    
The prime minister claimed that the reactionary forces had prepared a six-
week plan to create political instability in the country with the help of 
some institutions. We are aware of their plans and will not allow them to 
carry out terrorism.
    
She said it was the right of every citizen to oppose or criticise the 
policies of the government but no one can be allowed to create unrest and 
chaos. She claimed that there was complete political stability in the 
country. We have restored peace in Karachi and in spite of conspiracies to 
create unrest in Punjab, we have controlled the situation, she said. We 
cannot allow the Klashnikov culture to flourish in this country. We cannot 
allow sectarianism to spread in this country.

<a name="orde">Orders term completion : SC restores local bodies in Punjab</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, June 26: The Supreme Court restored on Wednesday the local 
bodies institutions in Punjab which were dissolved by the caretaker 
government of Moeen Qureshi before the general elections in 1993, and 
directed to let them complete their term ending Feb 9, 1997.
    
We ... order restoration of all the local bodies/councils in the province 
of Punjab to enable them to complete their term up to 9.2.1997 as 
contemplated under Section 26 of the Punjab Local Government Ordinance 
1979, the Supreme Court said in its short order after hearing the case on 
Wednesday.
    
The court over-ruled Lahore High Courts order of restoring only the 
petitioners if elections were not held within 90 days of its decision and 
instead restored all the local bodies in the province.

<a name="tech">Technology, science budget cut</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, June 26: The development budget of Ministry of Science and 
Technology 1996-97 has been reduced by over 43.7 per cent, as compared to 
Rs408.879 allocated under the Annual Development Plan 1995-96.
    
The ADP for 1996-97 has set aside only Rs229.930 for S & T in a country 
which already stands out in the comity of nations for its abysmally low 
expenditure on improving its manpower and infrastructure for S & T 
development. Does the reduced budget mean that Pakistan does not need S & 
T, wondered a veteran scientist. On the basis of 12 per cent inflation 
estimated by the government, the cut in S & T development for the next 
financial year is as high as 50.6%!
    
Interestingly, the utilisation of funds in the current year fell short of 
the budget due to economy cut and delayed provision of funds for various 
projects.
    
Notable among these projects is the Pakistan Museum of Natural History the 
construction of which has proceeded at a snails pace over the past seven 
years. Low priority evident in under-allocation of budgeted funds may force 
reduction in size of the museum project.
    
Even the minuscule development budget is fritter away substantially through 
lop-sided priorities. New projects are undertaken without proper 
consideration of the real needs of the country, while the existing ones are 
deprived of essential funds for research. For many years, existing R & D 
institutions have been provided with funds that are sufficient only for 
paying their staff salaries and meeting other recurrent expenditure.
    
Most universities are seriously handicapped due to non-availability of 
funds for replacing the outdated equipment, purchase of chemicals and 
science journals because it so happens that these are also catering for 
sons and daughters of ordinary Pakistanis, while the educational 
institutions created especially for the rich have surfeit of funds.

<a name="edhi">Edhi's biography launched</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, June 21:  Mirror to the blind, a biography of the world famous 
social worker, Abdus Sattar Edhi, was launched in a unique manner.
    
Simplicity and humbleness, the main features of Edhis personality, marked 
the book-launching ceremony.
    
A simple stall, set up at the Aabpara Jumma Bazaar by Edhis volunteers, 
presented the book for sale in the presence of Edhi and Tehmina Durrani, 
the author of the book.
    
Hundreds of people visited the camp during the day, and we have not yet 
counted as to how many books have been sold out, Javed Athar, an Edhi 
volunteer, told  Dawn. 
    
Mr Edhi, in a brief chat with reporters, described the book as a part of 
his mission to serve the humanity. It is a revolutionary step, and people 
should benefit from the book, he said.

Lamenting on the plight of the common man in Pakistan, he said they have 
been cheated by every successive government since Ayubs Martial Law, and 
the rulers were least bothered about their sufferings.

Regarding Karachi situation, he said it has improved a little under the 
present government, but a lot was required to be done. He called for a more 
sincere effort for restoration of lasting peace in the city.
    
Tehmina Durrani, who had earlier written  My Feudal Lord, said that she has 
done a service to humanity by writing the biography of Maulana Edhi. Ms 
Durrani was also planning to write the second volume of the book.
    
Dearth of any role-model is a serious dilemma of our society, she said 
while adding that Mr Edhi can become a good role model for those having the 
flair to serve humanity.
    
Interestingly no politician of any significance visited the Edhi camp. 
However, a large number of diplomats visited the camp and purchased the 
book. Among those were ambassadors of France, Finland, the Philippines, 
Malaysia and South Africa. South African mission purchased 25 books.
    
People also made huge donations at the camp. We have not counted, but 
these must be in thousands, another Edhi volunteer said.

<a name="hars">Harsh, tough, realistic, and reformist</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin
   
IT IS too harsh a budget for the masses to suffer in silence. Perhaps the 
harshest ever in the Pakistans fiscal history. It is a tough budget for 
the government to sell. Perhaps the political risk is totally that of the 
Prime Minister. It is, in fact, a make or break budget for her.
    
Nevertheless, it is a realistic budget to the extent that it does not play 
to the galleries with any gimmickry of relief for the so-called common man. 
It is also realistic in the sense that the government has not rushed in to 
placate the ever-watchful IMF with reductions in tariff rates to 55 per 
cent which would have increased the budgetary deficit by another Rs15 
billion.
    
It is a reformist budget in the sense that it proposes to take the first 
small step towards documenting the economy by withdrawing all sales tax and 
income tax exemptions. There is an element of equity as well in the 
measure.
    
However, first the severity of the budget:
    
The increase in the rates of sales tax from 15 per cent to 18 per cent, 
from 18 per cent to 20 per cent, and from 20 to 23 per cent, a measure 
estimated to bring in over Rs 12 billion, plus the increases in central 
excise duties on a number of items projected to yield about Rs 2.5 billion 
is likely to seriously impact on the general price line kicking off a new 
round of inflation, perhaps adding as much as two additional percentage 
points to the current rate while at the same time awarding a bonus of Rs 5 
billion in bribes to certain CBR staff for helping evade as much as Rs 7 
billion from the projected total additional yield of Rs 15 billion from the 
two measures.
    
Another paltry sum of Rs 400 million is being proposed to be squeezed out 
of the salaried classes, the only ones who pay their dues honestly. Over 
the years, in order to protect the salaried classes from the inequitable 
pressures of the taxation system and the ever-increasing prices a part of 
their incomes, like house rents, company car expenditures and entertainment 
had been exempted from the income tax.
    
Now these exemptions have been withdrawn cutting the take home salaries of 
the these people by almost half. This new measure is discriminatory too, 
because the government servants continue to enjoy the exemptions. What is 
more, while government owned bank employees have retained these exemptions, 
their colleagues in private banks have lost them. Can there be a more 
glaring instance of discrimination!
    
The argument of the budget bureaucracy is perhaps that the corporate sector 
through the tax free perks and perquisites to its employees puts too much 
of spare resources in their hands which brings supplies under pressure, 
thus pushing up prices. This is true to a point. But those who earn a gross 
salary of around Rs500,000 per annum with medium-sized families and having 
to look after their ageing parents, send their children to good schools 
(which have become too expensive) and maintain a respectable lifestyle (not 
ostentatious, by any chance) would find the world collapsing around them 
with the imposition of this new measure.
    
Perhaps, if the government were to amend the proposal so as to let those 
with a gross salary of Rs 500,000 per annum continue to enjoy the exemption 
and at the same time fix different, but lower rates for calculating the tax 
dues on perquisites and perks of employees earning more than Rs 500,000 
gross per annum, the consequent pain of the corporate employees would be 
largely diminished.
    
On one count it is a reformist budget as it has attempted to inculcate a 
measure of equity in the tax system by withdrawing almost all sales tax and 
income tax exemptions (except agricultural incomes which is discussed in 
its proper context in subsequent paragraphs) irrespective of its 
consequential impact on any section of society.
    
The upheaval and the economic dislocation, this measure, if implemented 
honestly, will cause is likely to be colossal. But this again, will serve 
as the first small step towards documenting the economy which is the only 
way one can minimise corruption and ensure elasticity in the taxation 
system. A fully documented economy will pave the way for increased revenue 
incomes which in turn will reduce dependence of the budget on borrowings.
    
With everybody required to account for every single penny he or she earns, 
the temptation for blatant bribery, commissions, kickbacks and siphoning 
off will be much less. This of course will not eliminate corruption and tax 
evasion. But it would surely reduce their incidence to a tolerable extent 
in the course of time.
    
The business community which runs its business on two books would surely 
find the measure unacceptable and oppose it tooth and nail. It will 
probably also try to bring the populace on the street and give a helping 
hand to the opposition in street agitations to somehow have the government 
removed or at least force it to withdraw the questionable budgetary 
measures as they did in 1987.
    
Sales tax is actually a consumption tax and its wide coverage will dampen 
demand for sometime and the measure in the first instance will reduce to a 
large extent wastes indulged in by the rich while increasing hardships for 
low and middle income groups.
    
However, with the elimination of anomalies in the tariff structure which 
has been promised to be completed by end September, this year and the 
likelihood of reduction in the overall tariff rates to 55 percent in the 
budget for 1997-98, the general price line will be positively affected as 
imports of consumer goods and industrial raw materials will become cheaper 
and it will then be time to replace demand management philosophy with 
supply induced growth which will make the life of the masses less 
intolerable.
    
However, in order to reach this point, the country would need another good 
cotton crop and the government meanwhile will have to overhaul the CBR and 
avoid as much as possible such scandals as the Mirage-III and Surrey 
mansion deals, alleged sale of jobs by MNAs, allotment of precious 
residential plots to parliamentarians in Islamabad at throw away prices , 
allowing luxury cars for the ruling elite etc.
    
One detects an element of political realism on the part of the government 
in not rushing Punjab into following the other three provinces into 
imposing tax on agricultural income. The Punjab politics has its own 
dynamism, especially, in view of the fact that the province is being ruled 
by a coalition government made up of PPP and PML(J) which is essentially 
the feudal arm of the Muslim League which chose to breakaway from the 
parent body because it felt its interests were not being looked after 
properly by party leadership which had gone into the hands of urban based 
industrial lobby.
    
However, the PM seems still hopeful that in the course of the budget debate 
and before the commencement of the next financial year, the Punjab will 
keep its promise made at the NEC meeting on May 30, 1996 and impose tax on 
agricultural incomes.
    
The rate of tax on agricultural incomes imposed by Sindh is too negligible 
to have any positive impact on the overall income of the province. Still, 
one cannot minimise its symbolic effect and cannot also ignore the fact 
that whatever the rate, a small step has at last been taken towards 
formalising 40 per cent of the national economy which had so far remained 
out of the official reckoning with its attendant adverse consequences.
    
If the Punjab were to follow suit before July 1 , 1996, its feudals would 
not lose much of their unearned incomes but the step will pave the way for 
resumption of the 1.2 billion dollars of ESAF and EFF assistance of IMF 
which in turn would improve the international risk rating of Pakistan 
facilitating an accelerated inflow of foreign investment badly needed to 
fill the wide gap between the demand and availability of resources to 
trigger the much needed GDP growth rate of 7-8 per cent per annum.
    
In one sense, the 1996-97 budget is two years too late. Many of the reforms 
introduced in this budget should have come along with the budgetary 
proposals of 1994-95. Had this happened, by now we would have had our 
tariffs reduced to at least 45 per cent and as a result an accelerated 
inflow of foreign investment would have taken place and the rate of 
inflation would have come down to around 8 per cent. And the growth rate 
would have jumped to around 8 per cent because as a result, industrial 
growth would have taken an upturn instead of stagnating, thereby augmenting 
the dramatic jump in the growth of agricultural sector this year.

<a name="amaj">A major damper for savings, investment and growth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

WHILE the urgent need of the country is to ensure higher and sustained 
economic growth by promoting larger bank deposits, higher overall savings, 
and greater productive investment, the new budget continues the old policy 
of focusing on mobilising larger tax revenues to meet the growing current 
expenditure of the government.
    
Current expenditure, which rose to 80.2 per cent of the overall budget this 
year as a result of the Rs. 15 billion rise over the budgeted figure, is 
expected to come down to 19 per cent next year, but usually the current 
expenditure far exceeds the budgeted one, as it did this year too while it 
jumped from 77.8 per cent of the GDP to 80.2 per cent while the development 
outlay plummeted from 22.2 per cent to 19.8 per cent.
    
But in a country with a population growth of 3 per cent in which private 
sector investment growth crashed to 10.24 according to the Economic Survey 
from a 30.31 per cent rise in 1991-92 (an altogether poor performance for 
the last three years) not enough efforts to promote domestic private sector 
investment are being made.
    
In fact, while a campaign is being conducted to attract foreign investment 
while the public sector investment has plummeted to a mere 13 per cent of 
the GDP at market prices (and hence the overall private investment is 
suddenly claimed to have risen to 29.43 per cent this year) there is real 
urgency to promote domestic private sector investment. And, that is all the 
more imperative as an investment growth of 20 per cent at current prices is 
no real growth at all because of inflation which is far higher the 
investment areas.

Taxing savings

All investment begins with getting more and more of the people to put their 
money into banks of other savings institutions or buying shares of 
companies or NIT units and ICP certificates. By now if anyone goes to a 
bank to open an account he has to pay 0.02 per cent of this deposit in cash 
as tax. He has to pay a similar tax when he wants to send money to anyone 
as a draft or pay order. And he has to pay the same kind of tax when he has 
to get a pay order to pay a tax to the income tax department, which means a 
tax on tax or paying a tax on paying the tax which is utterly absurd.
    
If he keeps the money in the bank and earns a profit, he has to pay 2.5 per 
cent of his deposits as Zakat and 10 per cent of his very profits as 
withholding tax. As a result, his profits may be as low as 5 per cent while 
inflation is 20 per cent or more. And he is a heavy looser for keeping his 
money in the bank.
    
If he wants to draw the money he had to pay Rs. 2 per leaf of a cheque book 
to the Centre as central excise and 50 paisa more as stamp duty to this 
Sindh government. As if all that robbing the depositor were not enough, the 
new federal budget raised the excise duty to Rs. 5 per leaf. Over and above 
that it has imposed sales tax of 18 per cent on cheque books even when they 
are given free by the banks. And that made many to fear a cheque book of 
ten leaves would cost around Rs. 68.
    
When the rise in the excise duty on a leaf of a cheque book to Rs. 5 was 
brought to the notice of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto she expressed her 
disapproval and suggested its revision. But raising the tax to Rs. 5 shows 
the insensitivity of those who framed the budget or their total lack of 
realism.
    
Even if the excise duty is reduced to Rs. 2 the 18 per cent sales tax on 
cheque books given free remains. And that could force the banks to pass on 
the tax to their clients along with the Sindh governments stamp duty of 50 
paisa per cheque.
    
Is it not extraordinary that in a country in which government banks until 
recently exhorted the people to open savings accounts with just Rs 5, a 
cheque should not cost that much or more, and the federal and provincial 
governments and heads of various tax departments should treat the cheque 
books as a hobby horse for raising larger revenues any time.
    
That this should happen in a country in which the slogans of documentation 
of the economy has been reverberates everywhere, and the need of the times 
if to bring in a much of the money as possible, and not only dollars only, 
into the banks, is astounding.
    
Such a drive for promoting savings is imperative at time when the rate of 
national savings has been coming down for the last five years from 16.90 
per cent of the GDP in 1991-92. It came down to 15.61 in 1993-94, 14.92 per 
cent last year and sank to 13.85 per cent this year.

High Inflation

A major reason why savings are down is the high and sustained inflation, 
far in excess of the under-stated official figures. It was stated 
officially to be 13 per cent last year, and is said to be 11 per cent this 
year but following the heavy tax levies of the new budget it may end at 12 
per cent according to official reckoning.
    
Those with large savings for sometime put their money on slicks and shares 
when the going was very good recently. After the stock market collapse the 
richer among them switched to real estate and made large profits, while 
others moved to make dollar deposits in our banks which have risen to $6.5 
billion, inclusive of deposits made by overseas Pakistanis.
    
They like making dollar deposits after converting their rupees into the US 
currency as that is exempt from income tax and Zakat and insulated against 
the devaluation of the rupee which has become a constant, and the deposits 
are generally beyond questions by the taxation authorities. And they 
provide profit of over 6 per cent and a total profit in rupees is over 20 
per cent.
    
But the government instead of making use of this large deposit - about $8 
billion in all - for productive purposes has been using it for current 
consumption and hence the governments liabilities in this area in terms of 
rupee has risen to Rs. 280 billion, which is now regarded as the short-term 
debt of the government. However, the liabilities if adjusted against the 
rupee loans given by banks against their dollar deposits can be lower.
    
When it comes to private investment in terms of the GDP has been both low 
and constant at a time when public sector investment is shrinking in 
following the steady privatisation. Private investment has been above 9 per 
cent and below ten per cent of the GDP and it came down to 8.82 per cent 
last year, and is estimated at 9.91 per cent this year. And this is at 
current prices which is very discomforting.
    
One of the major indicators of the poor investment growth is the state of 
the Karachi Stock Exchange index and the number of new companies listed on 
it each year. The general index of the KSE which rose by 79.5 per cent in 
193-94, fell by 35.6 per cent last year and by 2.3 per cent this year, 
according to the Economic Survey.
    
The government should have intervened in a positive manner to relieve the 
stock exchanges from the vicious grip of recession, but the budget has 
taken no step in that direction. Even the promise of lifting the 10 per 
cent withholding tax on bonus shares has not been fulfilled.
    
The government is hardly gaining anything by that tax as the number of 
bonus shares issued by companies suddenly dwindled after the 10 per cent 
tax levied last year. And yet the government has failed to lift this tax, 
although a paralysed stock market would undermine the privatisation process 
of the government and get low prices for the public sector units to be 
sold, like the United Bank, Bankers Equity, and Habib Bank.

Investors reaction

Foreign investment except in the power production sector, too, is 
discouraged by the paralysed state of the stock market for over two years. 
The fall in the KSE index by 51 points on Sunday following the reopening of 
the market after the budget and the quick was holidays shows how the 
investors are reacting to the budget with its shower of taxes all around.
    
Modaraba is one sector which needs real assistance as successive 
governments have given a raw deal to them. 
   
Now instead of the Modarabas being helped in any manner 1 per cent excise 
duty has been levied on loans given by them as well as the leasing 
companies which do not have the same facility as banks DFIs and investment 
banks to raise money from the public and hence deserved special treatment. 
   
The only help the budget has given to the stock exchanges is to make it 
obligatory for transactions in ICP certificates and NIT units to be done 
through the stock exchanges.
    
When it comes to the companies themselves, the budget has given a blow to 
the six-year schedule for reduction of taxes under which the rate of 
corporate taxation would have this year come down to 33 from 36 per cent. 
   
Similar relief available to the private companies and banks has also bee 
frozen. And that has been done after the companies were made to extend 
their business year by six months this year to 18 months and make their 
business year similar to the financial year. The government wanted to 
collect 18 months tax this year, which means revenues larger than last 
years.
    
Above all, when it comes to making investment they investors are not sure 
of the rate of taxes interest rates and profits to come. 
   
They realise that higher taxation, a wild sweep of sales tax which has been 
raised from 15 per cent to 18 per cent, would inflate prices, reduce demand 
and lower production and shrink their profits. 
   
They are aware, too, that such an aggressive fiscal policy would promote 
smuggling at one end and a parallel or tax evaded economy at the other. 
And, that is not a good climate for investors and manufacturers.

Faith in dollars

That is the reason a lot of people converted their money into dollars and 
placed it in banks. This tendency will become stronger now, particularly 
when devaluation of the inflation-hit rupee has become a regular feature. 
   
When instead of doing away with the regulatory duties imposed through the 
October 28 mini-budget, the five per cent regulatory duty is doubled to 10 
per cent to raise Rs. 4 billion as customs revenues, the investors faith 
in the system is shattered and he seeks to insulate himself and takes to 
trading or smuggling instead of making a productive investment.
    
That makes it imperative for the Prime Minister and the cabinet to review 
the whole fiscal policy instead of sacrificing everything at the altar of 
larger tax revenues and lower budget deficits however, urgent they seem to 
be now.  The fact is that when over-ambitious tax targets are set and taxes 
are sought to be collected rigorously, it reduces economic growth and 
lowers the total of the revenue collection. 
    
That has been happening all the time in Pakistan, including this year 
despite the fact 18 months taxes have been collected this time instead of 
the usual 12 months.
    
When domestic prices rise high as a result of heavy taxation or high as a 
result of heavy taxation or high cost of production or both, as in Pakistan 
now, smugglers have a run of the market particularly when Commerce Minister 
Ahmad Mukhtar says the cost of smuggling now is 23 per cent, and the 
parallel economy thrives making a hash of the much-vaunted privatisation 
process. Clearly the fiscal policy adopted and escalated now is a self-
defeating policy which will stifle and distort its proclaimed objectives 
and make the economic square far worse.

<a name="rura">Rural unemployment: a crippling constraint to development</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rao Abdul Rauf Khan

THERE IS a gaping disparity between the living standards of the rural and 
urban populations. Not only is the average rural per-capita income a 
fraction of the urban one, but the rural areas are also ill-provided with 
essential services like health, sanitation, recreation, education, safe 
water, electricity, farm-to-market roads and the like.
    
Availability of these facilities varies significantly, resulting in a poor 
economic base with no productive opportunities of life and a weak 
unorganised labour market. Thus if we want to develop Pakistan, the 
development of rural areas has to be considered at all costs.
    
Like any other developing country, Pakistan also suffers from a population 
problem characterised by a severe pressure on land creating the problem of 
employment and under-employment. Urban development is also hampered if 
there is no rural development. The fact seems to have escaped the notice of 
our planners and researchers as yet.
    
This is because of the push factors that the rural populace are migrating 
on a massive scale to urban areas and abroad in search of a living and 
raising of their social status. Today the urban population has increased to 
31 per cent as against 10 per cent in 1947-48.
    
Despite the poverty in urban areas, the most serious problems exist in the 
rural areas, a fact which we are facing today. Among those most affected 
are the rural youth, specially educated ones who in the absence of achieved 
opportunities of life failed to bag remunerative jobs.
    
In South Korea, it is the governments policy to curb the growing 
population of cities, saving them from turning into slum areas. Interested 
youths are invited to absorb themselves in agriculture and allied 
activities. Furthermore in order to give a boost to agriculture and absorb 
surplus labour productively, backward and forward linkage of industry with 
agriculture has been carried out. This in fact, has revolutionised the 
entire rural set up.

Economic base
    
Rural areas having agriculture as a base provide food and other raw 
materials not only to the urban sector, defence and local industry but also 
earn substantial foreign exchange by exporting surpluses on which rests 
future technological development. This is necessary as no developing 
country can afford to rely on imported food and other consumption times, 
for which rural development must take place to broaden participation of the 
people in those areas.
    
To bring development along practical lines, let us take a look at rural 
activities. When we talk about agriculture in Pakistan, we think of visible 
activities such as arable farming based on growing of majority and minor 
crops, including fruits, vegetables and other specialised enterprises and 
its ancillary activities based on rearing of cows, sheep, goats, poultry 
and the like.
    
Thus agriculture with its branches of animal and crop husbandry, forestry, 
horticulture, and fisheries is the largest segment of Pakistans economy. 
What we need is to distinguish between what is grown for personal use of 
growers and that which goes to market.
    
As many semi-agricultural activities can be started for example, 
silviculture, hunting, sericulture, apiculture, collecting fruits and 
vegetable, fishing and the like, thus, agriculture is the art of getting as 
many useful products from nature as is possible.
    
In an agrarian society most of the people indulge in multifarious 
activities one way or the other. The main characteristics of Pakistans 
agriculture are the fertile soil of the country, a generally favourable 
climate with a network of canal irrigation. The unhappy aspects are low 
yield because of primitive mode of cultivation, uncertainty of weather 
conditions, fragmentation of holding, the twin menace of waterlogging and 
salinity, and injudicious use of irrigation water because of a lack of 
other socio-economic infrastructure, slow pace in induction of appropriate 
technology and low farm investment. These are the other reasons why 
agriculture is not considered economically viable, specially of the small 
farming community comprising 93 per cent owning up to 10 hectares of land.
    
In fact, it is the low productivity level and the laying of less emphasis 
on growing of value-added remunerative crop enterprises which is 
responsible for the creation of poverty, resulting in unemployment in the 
rural sector.  We can consider activities directly connected with 
agriculture. For example manufacture of tools and other farm equipment, 
transport, fertilisers, pesticides, seeds and other inputs for agriculture, 
physical infrastructure like roads, water, electricity, irrigation devices 
etc. storage, processing and trading/marketing of produce and the like.
    
Agriculture cannot exist without these associated activities. However, who 
will perform these services? Certainly all of them cannot be performed by 
agriculturists themselves or by people from outside agriculture. Then we 
have activities which are not directly connected with agriculture, but 
pertain to the localised economic and social situation, like, housing, 
clothing, manufacturing on small scale-cottage industry like shoe-making, 
poultry, and utensil making etc.
    
These articles should be produced in cottage industries serving the needs 
of the rural population but in reality very few are. Further we should not 
forget service activities such as repairs, recreation, health, education, 
administration, local trade marketing and local fairs etc.
    
Cultivators and agricultural labour who are directly or indirectly involved 
in agriculture form 68 per cent while of other services falling within the 
purview of non-agricultural sector forms 32 per cent of the rural labour 
force.
    
In fact, a cultivator or a labourer directly involved in agriculture, does 
not find jobs for more than 100 and 120 days in a year. According to the 
Agricultural Census 1990, out of the 17.46 million rural labour force only 
12.30 million are absorbed mainly on share cropping basis where as 5.11 
million are employed as part time workers in which a major portion are 
women whereas out of 2.56 million casual disguised labour less than half 
are employed on seasonal operations like harvesting, inter-culturing and 
marketing of produce etc.  With the introduction of farm mechanisation the 
number of working hours have been further reduced. Completing agricultural 
operation per acre within 10 hours against 76 to 80 hours through a pair of 
bullocks. This means that both the agricultural and service class in the 
rural sector have to be absorbed in part time remunerative jobs on the 
pattern of South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, if at all their services are 
productively utilised.
    
The share of rural population in industry is nominal which is neither in 
proportion to resources nor to population. The set-up of agro-based 
industries in the rural sector by envisaging a liberal policy on the 
pattern of Turkey without obtaining permission from the government has to 
be evolved.

Rural development
    
Rural development can take place only when all segments of the rural sector 
of which agriculture is the base, are developed at the same time. Only then 
can accumulation of surplus skilled and non-skilled rural youth be ensured. 
As development progresses, its needs change. In the beginning we need more 
agricultural activities, but as a developing country, there is a greater 
need for off-farm activities.
    
Agricultural development cannot be considered in isolation. It is dependent 
on micro-economic and other economic policies. The reality is that the 
problems that have to be overcome are essentially ideological and political 
and not social and economic.
    
It is a firm conviction that in any country if any reform or programme is 
introduced with only the political effect in view then there are little 
chances of attaining success, as has been seen in the case of introduction 
of land reforms, rural development programmes like village aid, basic 
democracies, rural works programme (RWP), Integrated Rural Development 
Programme (IRDP) the Five-Point Programme for rural development, Tameer-e- 
watan programme and the Peoples Works Programme and SAP by the present 
regime.
    
It is due to social stratification in our rural society because of the 
feudal system, a weak environmental set-up, lack of opportunities that the 
rural people are migrating.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 26: The National Assembly passed a Rs.500.2 billion budget 
for 1996-97, carrying one major amendment in the Finance Bill that will 
allow the appointment of a private agency to exercise the functions and 
powers of assessment of income and collection of taxes.

The amendment also provided for delegation of powers to any tax authority 
of the provincial government for assessment and collection of wealth tax on 
agriculture.
    
The budget for next fiscal was adopted without the presence of the 
opposition which on Tuesday boycotted the budget session saying that it 
could not become a party to what it termed the harshest taxes ever imposed 
on the people of Pakistan.
    
Since it was an opposition-less house, the passage of the Finance Bill took 
less than two hours.
    
Although no details were given about the proposed tax collection agency in 
the private sector, it was learnt that PPP MNA Khalid Ghurki will be given 
the contract for the assessment and income tax collection for Lahores 
Liberty Market.
    
Official sources told Dawn that CBR officials had vehemently opposed the 
tax collection through the private agency. They said that at present the 
shopkeepers of Lahores Liberty Market, were paying less than one million 
rupees annually and even if a new contract was given ten time higher than 
the previous revenue levels, the additional revenue would still not pass on 
to the government coffers.
    
The CBR, sources said, told the government that if at all the tax 
collection system was to be privatised, there should be auction and the 
highest bidder be awarded the contract for the purpose.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, June 26: The State Bank of Pakistan made a key amendment in the 
rules for the release of foreign exchange to overseas travellers , 
apparently to save foreign exchange reserves from further depletion.
    
A SBP circular said that those intending to go abroad by any means of 
travel would be allowed to carry foreign exchange up to only $100 in cash. 
Previously the restriction applied only to travellers using land routes.
    
The SBP has already conveyed the decision to all banks dealing in foreign 
exchange. The decision has already become effective from June 24.
    
Several bankers, interviewed by Dawn, said the move apparently aimed at 
saving foreign currency deposits and ,in turn, foreign exchange reserves 
from further decline. The SBP had approved foreign exchange worth slightly 
more than $700 million as on June 20.
    
The circular directed the banks to issue foreign exchange up to only $100 
in cash and the rest of the permissible amount under Private Travel 
Exchange Quota (PTEQ) in the form of travellers cheques, TTs, MTs or draft 
to all Pakistanis aged 12 or more, who intend to travel abroad. Under PTEQ, 
an adult Pakistani , intending to travel abroad, can carry maximum foreign 
exchange up to $2,100 in one calendar year.

The bankers said the SBP decision aimed at checking flight of foreign 
currency in the form of dollars taken out from the country under PTEQ. A 
vast majority of businessmen visit foreign countries every now and then, 
which results in heavy withdrawals of foreign currency notes from the 
banks.

<a name="isou">Is our foreign debt still manageable?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aslam Sheikh

Pakistans foreign debt is no longer as manageable as it used to be till 
recently. The net transfer of foreign credits in the fiscal year just 
closing was only 16 per cent of the gross disbursement of $ 2.4 billion. 
This means most of what we borrow is used to service our mounting debt 
burden.
    
What is the latest foreign debt profile in more detail? The relevant budget 
documents do not tell a happy story. The USA, once our single largest donor 
in the good old cold war days has now become net importer of capital from 
Pakistan. We are now repaying $ 400 million to Washington annually to 
service our old bilateral debt.
    
Inflow of concessional credits or grant assistance from this old friend is 
negligible thanks not only to the lingering impact of the well-known legal 
hurdle stemming from the Pressler Amendment but also because of the post 
cold war shift in US policy.  Even the debt negotiated during the cold war 
period was not as soft and concessional as sometime assumed. Except for the 
fifties and early sixties, the so-called softening has been on the decline.

Poor mans largesse
    
This is evident from the huge debt service burden that we have been 
carrying for the last decade and half. The outstanding and disbursed 
external credit from the US till June 30th, 1995 was over $ 2.6 billion but 
its servicing cost has been quite heavy. Annual repayment to the US, both 
in principal and interest has been rising over the past decade. From $ 235 
million in 1985-86 it climbed to $ 349 million five years later in 1990-91 
and was $ 400 million by the current fiscal.
    
Over this decade Pakistan has repaid over $ 800 million in interest alone. 
Add to this the repayment in principal, the total repayment between 1986 
and 1996 was over $ 3 billion to the US alone.
    
Japan has been the largest second beneficiary of our debt servicing. We 
repaid it $ 311 million in the current fiscal including interest charges of 
$ 127 million. Ten years ago this annual repayment was only $ 60 million.  
Japans outstanding debt is of over $ 4 billion of which over $ 2 billion 
worth of credit remains to be disbursed. Japan has always been lending on 
hard terms, therefore its annual debt servicing has been heavy from the 
beginning. For instance, for many years when its annual flow was small the 
interest repayment was always more than the principal.
    
Annual repayments to Germany third important donor are also significant 
and were over $ 150 million in 1995-96 including interest of $ 44 million. 
Repayment to France has also been rising and is now $ 100 million (1995-
96).
    
Pakistans debt servicing of credits received from financial institutions 
like the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, International Development 
Association, IMF trust fund and some others is now over $ 750 million 
including interest of $ 58 million.
    
Islamic countries which emerged as important donors in the seventies after 
the oil boom have become insignificant lenders in 1995-96 Pakistan repaid 
over $ 77 million to 12 Muslim countries including OPEC and IDBP.
    
Of this Saudi Arabia was repaid $ 15 million including interest charge of $ 
1.5 million with UAE a close second with $ 12 million including interest 
payment of $ 3 million.
    
Repayment on loans contracted with the former Soviet Union was over $ 46 
million while we paid China more than $ 92 million.
    
Pakistans outstanding debt (excluding roughly $ 9 billion not yet 
disbursed) now is over $ 23 billion (1995-96) of medium and long-term 
nature. Its debt servicing cost during this year was $ 2.1 billion 
including interest of $ 756 million.
    
In 1990-91 outstanding debt was $ 15 billion. In 1993-94 it was over $ 20 
billion. It is 35.7 per cent of GDP now whereas it was 34 per cent in 1990-
91. Excluding debt servicing on short term loans and IMF charges, debt 
servicing has soared from a mere $ 17 million in 1960-61 to $ 2,100 million 
in 1995-96.
    
According to the latest budget, interest on foreign debt next fiscal (1996-
97) will be Rs 28 billion while the repayment of principal will be close to 
Rs 44 billion.
    
We have been claiming credit for not defaulting on foreign repayments so 
far and underplaying the magnitude of external indebtedness compared to 
domestic debt burden. Nonetheless the evolving situation does not rule out 
the danger of a possible debt explosion in the external sector.
    
After all we did face an uneasy situation in late sixties when we imposed a 
unilateral moratorium on conversion of debt repayment in foreign currency. 
Unless we adopt a multi-dimensional strategy of boosting our external 
earnings through a dramatic jump in diversified exports and stimulating 
inflow of remittances from our own nationals keen to invest in Pakistan 
inspite of political and economic uncertainty, even foreign debt can be 
unmanageable.
    
The other day in an exchange of views with economic writers the Prime 
Minister revealed her plans to arrange consultants for this purpose.
    
According to the economic survey, workers remittances have slumped to $ 
1,148 million in 1995-96 from $ 1,446 million in 1993-94 and the peak of 
almost $ 3 billion in the early eighties. Even if the fall is almost 
compensated by an increase under the government scheme of resident foreign 
currency account, there is no cause for complacency.

Workers remittances

The nature of resident currency accounts is different and these are not 
comparable to remittances. Pakistan told the consortium meeting in Paris 
earlier this year that prospects for the invisible balance would continue 
to be governed largely by the behaviour of the workers remittances.
    
This area therefore needs to be attended to with more than routine effort. 
The potential is far from exhausted even if the boom in the Gulf is over. 
Remittances from USA where there is considerable increase in our nationals 
in recent years still have considerable promise as the trend of recent 
years indicate. The flow from USA now is greater than UK, once the biggest 
source from the western world.
    
Now nearly 10 per cent of the total comes from the USA and Canada combined. 
Above all external concessional loans are now unobtainable without strings 
and excessive reliance on them distorts our priorities. The experience of 
the last four decades clearly demonstrates that our real economic 
development depends on our own resources and not on expensive tied 
credits.

<a name="stoc">Stocks turn easy as index declines by 5.17 points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, June 26: Stocks turned an easy performance as investors took 
profits at the overnight inflated levels as fears of political uncertainty 
gripped the market.
    
The other destabilising factor was news of reported failure of Islamabad 
talks on the budget between the top business and the officials and threat 
of business strike to press for the acceptance of demands.
    
But investors appear to be more worried over the political polarisation 
between the contenders of power, notably after the Islamabad incident in 
which two persons were killed early this week, dealers said.
    
But they dont think that the market is in for a major shake-out as 
institutional traders are in the rings and are active buyers at the dips.
    
The KSE 100-share index suffered fall of 5.17 points at 1,707.36 as 
compared to 1,712.53 a day earlier, reflecting the weakness of some of the 
base shares.

Wellcome Pakistan, which has been under pressure for the last two sessions, 
for instance came in for renewed strong support and shot up by Rs 20, 
indicating that it has resumed last week run-up on expectations of higher 
earnings after an increase in the sale tax from July 1.
    
But by and large, many blue chips, which scored sharp rallies overnight 
finished with extreme clipped under the lead of Ghemini Leasing, and some 
others.
    
Soneri Bank, which rose by Rs 7 on Tuesday, was put on the spot list by the 
KSE authorities to forestall further speculative rise in its share value. 
It ended Rs 3 lower.
    
Along with Soneri Bank, three other scrips are now on the spot list as they 
have already witnessed a price flare-up under the lead of Ciba-Geigy, 
Singer Pakistan and Siemens Pakistan.
    
Singer Pakistan showed a further decline of Rs 10, while Siemens fell by an 
extended fall of Rs 5.
    
But the biggest fall of the day was noted in Kohat Cement, which fell by Rs 
12.50 on hasty selling not backed by negative news.
    
Al-Abid Silk also maintained its downward course falling by another Rs 10 
to make the total loss during the last four sessions to Rs 40.
    
Shell Pakistan, Askari Leasing, Adamjee Insurance, General Tyre, ICI 
Pakistan, Dawood Hercules and Philips were among the other prominent 
losers, which suffered fall ranging from Rs 2 to 5.
    
Among the gainers, KASB, Metropolitan Bank, Alico, Prudential Commercial 
Bank, Bhanero Textiles, Musrat Textiles, Glaxo Lab and Reckitt and Colman 
were leading, which rose by Rs 1.50 to 3.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 20 paisa on 13.035m, 
followed by Hub-Power, unchanged on 6.007m, Dewan Salman, higher 95 paisa 
on 1.548m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, lower 25 paisa on 0.603m, Sui Southern, 
up 25 paisa on 0.253m, Kohat Cement, off Rs 12.50 on 0.231m, and Soneri 
Bank, off Rs 3 on 0.156m shares. There were some other notable deals also.
    
Trading volume totalled 2.646m shares as compared to 26.798m shares a day 
earlier.
    
There were 376 actives, out of which 177 shares fell, while 116 rose, with 
83 holding on to the last levels.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

ONE hundred and eighty-one years ago, to the day, as I write this, Alt 
Vorwarts (as Field Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher, Prince of 
Wahlstadt (1742-1819) was affectionately known), had just finished writing 
to Baron Muffling:
    
Say in my name to the Duke of Wellington that ill as I am I will march at 
the head of my army to attack without delay the right flank of the enemy, 
if Napoleon should attempt anything against the Duke. In case the French do 
not attack today, I am of the opinion that we should attack the French army 
together tomorrow.
    
As it happened Napoleon did attack at Waterloo on June 18, 1815, and the 
small narrow field witnessed one of the most decisive battles. Wellingtons 
troops that day numbered 63,000, two-thirds of them other than British, 
against Napoleons 70,000 and between both sides there were some 400 guns. 
It proved to be Napoleons last battle, as it was the Dukes.
    
Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington (1769-1852), was an amazing man, an 
over-cautious general for whom today there is widespread appreciation of 
his military genius and of his character, and as an honest and selfless 
politician, uncorrupted by vast prestige.
    
He cut his teeth in India, where he arrived in 1796 to command the 33rd 
Foot, which later became the Duke of Wellingtons Regiment. In 1799, he 
commanded a division in the campaign against Tiger Tipoo Sahib, and after 
the capture of Tipoos capital, Seringapatam he was made Governor and 
military and civil administrator of Mysore. In two campaigns in Mysore he 
crushed the great freebooter, Dhoondiah Wagh. He was promoted Major- 
General in 1802 and his first major victory of independent command was in 
1803 during the Second Mahratta War, when with 7,000 men and 22 guns he 
defeated 40,000 Mahrattas with a 100 guns at Assaye. He was then appointed 
chief military and civil administrator in the Deccan, where he fought on 
against Holkar and Scindia, taking Ahmednagar and defeating the Mahrattas 
again at Argaum. He later stormed Gawilghur, and concluded peace with the 
Raja of Berar and with Scindia.
    
India gave him invaluable training for his coming campaigns. He learned all 
the aspects of organising a large army in the field and importantly about 
the need for moderation in eating and in drinking. He often rode 50 miles 
in one day, becoming physically tough, and he learned to put worries to one 
side and to sleep soundly, however trying the conditions. His recipe for 
good health was good temper. It was in this subcontinent that he learned 
complete self-confidence, and developed his successful qualities  the 
ability to make decisions, common sense, attention to detail, care of his 
soldiers and their supplies, good relations with the civilian population. 
Above all, he found his lifes purpose. It was to give service.
    
In 1827, after the Napoleonic wars, he became the British Commander-in-
Chief, resigning in 1828 when he was appointed prime minister which post he 
held to 1830. He resigned as PM after being defeated on the issue of 
parliamentary reform. He remained in opposition till 1843, subsequently 
holding the office of foreign secretary. He finally resigned from public 
life in 1846 at the age of 77. No non-royal had ever, up to then, enjoyed 
such respect among the mass of the population.
    
He laid the foundations of many an institution, all of which still survive 
 amongst them the Royal United Services Institute for Defence Studies 
(RUSI), founded in 1831, one of the oldest institutions of its kind in the 
world which throughout its history has been at the forefront of 
contemporary political and military thought. (We too have our Institute of 
Strategic Studies, the chairmanship of which provides a perch for perks for 
my friend and religious scholar-strategist, Agha Murtaza Pooya).
    
In London Wellington lived at Apsley House, Hyde Park Corner (where the 
present Duke still lives), and in the country at Stratfield Saye, bought 
for him after Waterloo by a grateful nation.
    
As a young man he was of vigorous disposition and Harriette Wilson, in her 
Memoirs claimed to have sometimes consoled him. The publisher of the book, 
Stockdale, sent a blackmailing letter to the Duke. He simply wrote upon it 
the words Publish and be damned, and sent it right back. But then he was 
a straightforward outstanding man.
    
What is happening to us now is that we, the 130 million people, are being 
internationally, rightly or wrongly, adjudged and damned. Disturbing 
articles and adverse news reports are being published abroad in newspapers 
and magazines that matter about our leaders, and our country.
    
The year started badly. Barrons, The Dow Jones Business and Financial 
Weekly (published in New York) is read by the men of every financial 
institution and bank of standing. It holds annual conferences to which it 
invites men of stature in the world of finance and investment. At the 1996 
round-table conference held in January, Banker Jim Rogers said of Pakistan: 
The market has caved in. There is violence in the streets. The cotton crop 
failed three years in a row  their largest source of external exchange. It 
has just been an unmitigated disaster. Benazir Bhutto is a ... and a .. and 
a ... and a ... And you can quote me. Anyway, they are going to have a 
cotton crop again. And the government has started buying shares  its 
starting to do everything it can to support the exchange.
    
This was damning indeed. The credibility of our Prime Minister had been 
attacked at a top financiers meeting. According to a Dawn report from its 
Washington correspondent printed at the end of January, the Prime Minister 
was considering serving a notice on Barrons if it refused to apologise and 
express its regrets. Nothing was done by her to uphold her honour, or our 
countrys reputation. No official protests were raised. Did our Ambassador 
to the US go to Rogers to find out why he had said what he had and on what 
he had based his findings?
    
Next came the bombshell from Germany. We read about the information on 
international corruption stored and analysed at the University of 
Gottingen. It defines corruption as the misuse of public power for private 
benefits such as the bribing of public officials, taking kickbacks in 
public procurement or embezzling public funds.
    
Besides their own research, also relied upon are report perceptions from 
people in international business, mostly emanating from industrialised 
nations who deal regularly with foreign companies and governments. The 
rating we got from Gottingen was that, despite our best efforts, we stood 
second, to Nigeria. Again, our government seemed satisfied with the 
Gottingen findings. No one went to Gottingen to challenge the placing, or 
to find out about their method of indexing. Did our Ambassador in Germany 
bother?
    
Thirdly, the question of the Surrey estate measuring some 350 acres 
reportedly bought by the Prime Minister and/or her spouse, with a private 
landing strip, an indoor swimming pool and alarm systems connected to 
Scotland Yard (a facility only available to a head of state or government). 
Londons Sunday Express stands by the story, as reported on the front page 
of Dawn on June 16.
    
The Economist, widely read all over the world, in its issue of June 15-21, 
under the heading Muck and money reports that: Miss Bhutto and Mr 
Zardari have stoutly denied the allegations. How can anyone think of 
buying a mansion in England when people in Pakistan dont even have a roof 
over their heads? protested Mr Zardari. The allegation is petty and 
mean, said Miss Bhutto angrily. It is against the Koran to level false 
charges against a woman. Both say they are thinking of suing the British 
paper. The Sunday Express has said it stands by its story and is prepared 
to defend any libel action.
    
The people of Pakistan say that, Benazir and Asif will not be foolish 
enough to sue, and they ask, Is this what we are taxed for?
    
I would commend people to reread what Shahid Hussain wrote in Dawn on June 
10. Shahid has just retired as the Senior Executive vice-president of the 
World Bank, having been with the Bank for 33 years. Shahid, a very worried 
Pakistani, says that when the Prime Ministers economic team was last in 
Washington, our high and mighty privately admitted that expenditure 
control had broken down and that the target for tax collection was highly 
exaggerated. Why are they not admitting it to the people of Pakistan? The 
same officials complained in the US that the heads of public financial 
organisations were appointed on the special instructions of a high-up. 
Shahid also reports that there are seven billion dollars of foreign 
exchange deposits against which the State Bank has no reserves.
    
He will be coming to Karachi next month and I have invited him to meet me 
and my business friends and apprise us about Washingtons perception of 
Pakistan. My question: How many inches of water are there under our keel?

THE annual budget exercise is much like a visit to the dentist: you know 
its going to hurt even though the dentist keeps assuring you that it 
wont. This year, the agony has been especially excruciating.
    
And to add insult to injury, those responsible for inflicting this pain are 
giggling at our discomfort from the sidelines, safe in the knowledge that 
their vast agricultural incomes remain outside the purview of the tax-
collectors. 

To rub further salt into our wounds, newspapers here and abroad inform us 
every day of the fiscal skulduggery and the extravagant lifestyle of our 
leaders who insouciantly keep sweeping this dirt under the carpet. And who 
cares if the pile under the carpet now threatens to touch the ceiling?
    
We remain so busy ducking for cover at the end of the fiscal year that we 
forget that the budget, apart from being a balance sheet indicating the 
governments expenditure and income, is also supposed to reflect the 
governments economic philosophy. In effect, it is a statement of intent of 
the ruling partys approach to economic development. OK, so in Pakistan the 
whole exercise has come to resemble legalised highway robbery, but we 
should not lose sight of the larger policy aspect of the annual budget. 
However, we can be excused for overlooking this as it is doubtful that 
those responsible for framing this document have any purpose in mind higher 
than the intention to gouge as much out of us as possible. It goes without 
saying that the land- owning gentry are excluded from the list of 
sacrificial victims.
    
If this particular budget seems more extortionist than its producers, it is 
largely because the governments expenditure keeps rising exponentially. 
Rather than accepting the pain involved in cutting costs, our rulers have 
decided to take the easier route of hitting us for increases in defence 
spending and the salaries and allowances of our elected representatives, 
and the heads of the government and the state. No doubt this enhancement in 
pay and perks is viewed by them as a well-deserved bonus for a job well 
done. Had we been consulted in the matter, we might have expressed a 
different opinion. Indeed, most people I know would have responded with a 
jeer and a rude gesture.
    
Given the callousness of most of our legislators  not to mention their 
obscurely-gained wealth  it is inconceivable that they will ever stand up 
for us when the budget is being rammed through Parliament. With all its 
sound and fury, the Opposition will do no more than scoring a few debating 
points: remember how they shafted us when they were in power? So I suggest 
that everybody involved with the budget-making exercise should be forced to 
live on the income of a middle-class Pakistani for one month. This way, 
when they slap on their GST and sundry other rapacious levies, they will 
know exactly how much pain they are causing the average housewife.
    
Returning to the larger question of economic development, The Economist 
recently devoted a cover story (The mystery of economic growth) to the 
subject. In brief, the London-based weekly attempted to isolate those 
factors that enabled certain poor countries to sprint ahead, and tried to 
identify the reasons why some societies remain backward. 
   
The conclusion reached by the magazine is that liberal economic policies 
and a democratic dispensation play a pivotal role in determining success or 
failure. Although this seems fairly obvious and self-evident, Mr George 
Ayittey, president of The Free Africa Foundation, has taken issue with this 
approach in a letter to the editor published in last weeks Economist. I am 
quoting his views at some length because some of them may be of relevance 
to us:
    
As a black African, I find your treatise... missing a key factor: the 
nature of government itself. The political character of the state 
(democratic or authoritarian) is not particularly important.
    
In most Third World countries, the state itself has been hijacked by 
gangsters, with every key institution (judiciary, banking, military, Press, 
etc.) debauched. Sub-Saharan Africa  the poorest region in the Third World 
 is a prime example. Brutally inefficient and grotesquely incompetent 
authoritarian regimes proliferate. The underlying ethics of 
authoritarianism are self-aggrandisement and self-perpetuation. Access to 
political power guarantees fabulous wealth. (The richest people in Africa 
are heads of state and ministers). Thus, the political and economic systems 
are fused: it is futile to reform one without the other. What keeps 
Africans poor is their powerlessness to remove predatory governments or 
force existing ones to adopt the right policies in a peaceful way.
    
This stinging indictment reinforces the recent findings of Transparency 
International, the Berlin-based organisation that issues annual rankings of 
the most corrupt countries in the world: out of the top ten of the venality 
sweepstakes, just about every one is a Third World nation. And all the most 
honest countries are developed Western societies. So much for those who see 
Western society as a moral cesspool.
    
But as Lenin asked in the title of a famous booklet, Where Do We Go From 
Here? How do we reform the system and purge it of our tormentors? Clearly, 
those at the helm of affairs have to set an example in austerity and 
integrity. Until this happens, we can hardly expect others occupying the 
lower rungs of the hierarchy to clean up their act. Also, before lecturing 
the rest of us to pay our taxes, it would help us to maintain a stiff upper 
lip if we saw our leaders coughing up their share. Unfortunately, the list 
of taxpayers made public by Mr Moeen Qureshi during his brief tenure as 
caretaker prime minister revealed the full extent of tax evasion in this 
country: some of the richest families in Pakistan  including some of our 
most prominent politicians  pay virtually no taxes. At the same time, they 
flaunt their vast wealth in the most obscene manner.
    
Given their thick hides and utter lack of shame, it would be expecting too 
much of our elites to think they will change their ways. They consider it 
their God-given right to live off the fat of the land while we subsidise 
their extravagant and vulgar lifestyle. As far as they are concerned, only 
suckers pay taxes. Alas, they are not far wrong: by voting in the same 
class of exploiters time after time, we deserve what we are getting. Or 
rather, what is being extorted from us.
    
So if we want the system to change for the better, we will have to change 
our own attitudes first.

WHAT will remain of the Republic when its masters (I dare not say its 
present masters) have finished with it? An empty till, Air Marshal 
Khattaks Flying Circus (consisting of his hi-tech Mirages) and a people 
carrying the burden of the realisation that their patience and intelligence 
have been abused yet again.
    
It is not just the acquisition of Rockwood, the Zardaris estate in Surrey, 
which is accentuating Pakistans current summer of discontent. A single 
estate changing hands in the English countryside should not come as a 
surprise to anyone who is even remotely aware of what has been happening in 
the Republic over the last two and a half years. What is breath-taking is 
the effrontery accompanying this disclosure. If it is a cock-and-bull 
story, as the Prime Minister and her spouse have heatedly insisted, why 
hasnt a libel notice been slapped on the Sunday Express? The powers that 
be (a wonderful euphemism when you cannot name anyone directly) have not 
been so cautious in serving defamation notices on errant journalists 
(including myself) in Pakistan. Why the hesitation in doing so when it 
comes to a foreign publication, especially one which has caused more damage 
to the already tarnished credibility of this government than any other 
single item of prurience or scandal?
    
Brazen audacity, however, compels admiration. On Saturday evening the Prime 
Minister could again be seen on television squatting on the ground (no 
doubt a handsome gesture towards the awam) and telling newsmen in Islamabad 
that her governments priority, for which it had to impose a harsh budget, 
was the eradication of poverty. What do you make of such a statement? 
Rockwood and poverty. They indeed go hand in hand with each other. 
Meanwhile, the Sunday Express, with a cruelty bordering on the sadistic, 
reports yet again that local authorities around Rockwood have refused 
permission to the owners of this property to set up a stud but have 
approved another application to build 63 loose boxes (whatever these are) 
to keep polo ponies in.
    
What kind of a democracy have we built in Pakistan? Democracy is not only a 
system of checks and balances. It also means a system of accountability 
which prevents those in power from committing excesses. In this country the 
concept of the rule of law has always had a weak grip on the people. As for 
rulers, they have always considered it their prerogative to be above the 
law and to use public office for self-enrichment. But in these last ten 
years this tendency has broken all previous records. Today the people of 
Pakistan (that is, those who think about these problems) are not just 
concerned about the acquisition of one country estate in England. If that 
was all it would be no great matter. What they are asking is whether there 
are any limits to high-powered greed?
    
Remember Tolstoys short story How much land does a man need? Well, how 
much wealth does a man need? What is the extent of it that would satisfy 
him? Ruling and administration are great privileges that are not bestowed 
by the heavens upon every mortal. Even though it may have enormous 
problems, Pakistan with its 130 million souls is not a small country. Being 
called upon to administer its affairs is a great privilege. And yet 
consider the outlook of the persons who over the years have enjoyed this 
privilege.
    
Admittedly, it is not easy for every ruler to become Akbar the Great. A 
camel-driver will behave like a camel-driver even if you make him king. 
Still, even if people do not expect greatness from their rulers, they look 
for a modicum of restraint and good sense from them. It is also true that 
at times even small men are touched by the greatness of the offices that 
through the intercession of a blind providence they happen to occupy. But 
look at the people of Pakistan whose destiny it has been to be lorded over 
by rulers the mediocrity of whose talents has been inversely proportional 
to the extent of their greed.
    
India next door has not been gifted with great rulers either. But at least 
there is some residual sense of shame amongst its ruling circles. If a 
minister or a son of the prime minister is caught in a scandal there are 
red faces all around and there is some attempt at independent investigation 
and prosecution. Contrast this with Pakistan where the biggest scandals 
sink without a trace into the cesspool that national politics has become. 
Other democracies pride themselves on their accountability. In the United 
States most people would be hard- pressed to come up with the precise 
details of the Whitewater scandal. And yet President Clinton and his wife 
for all their efforts cannot break free from its tentacles. Pakistan, on 
the other hand, must take the prize for unaccountability. Anything, 
virtually anything, that someone in a position of power does, he can get 
away with. Not only that but woe betide anyone who comes too much in his 
way.
    
Just consider in this connection what happened in the case of M.B. Abbasi, 
the head of the National Bank. Not long ago there was a newspaper story 
which spoke of his rise and rise. When the intrepid journalist who was 
behind the story had some discreet questions put to him, he found himself 
unable to hide his sources. Although all of those putative sources were 
fairly senior bankers, they were picked up like so many flies by the 
ubiquitous FIA and kept in the clink till they or their families had 
abjectly apologised to M.B. Abbasi. What is the moral of the tale? That 
cross a person like Abbasi only at your peril. Also that the Whitewater 
scandal would never have erupted in Pakistan. My friend Rehman Malik of the 
FIA would soon have taken care of it. As for M.B. Abbasi with his powerful 
connections, I have no hesitation in admitting that if I were to see him 
coming from the opposite direction, I would move over to the other side of 
the street.
    
If we really had a system of checks and balances, the excesses of one 
branch of the government would be balanced by the correcting hand of 
another. But in Pakistan today we have a President who has been acting like 
a Postmaster General. Send him something and he will receive it and then 
probably mark it to some other destination. If he hears of something he 
will pull a long face and try to look like a Solon. But he has amply shown 
that it is foolish to pin any other hopes on him.
    
It is not that he should become an interfering Tom like Ghulam Ishaq Khan 
did in his dotage. But must he acquiesce helplessly in every questionable 
act of the government? Did he have to confirm the appointment of the jiala 
judges whose position had become disputed as a result of the so-called 
judges case just a day before the Supreme Court was to announce its 
verdict? That surely was going beyond the call of constitutional duty. And 
what about the reference or the review petition sent by the government to 
the Supreme Court? Anyone who says that the President had no choice in the 
matter is guilty of naivete. If a president empowered by the Eighth 
Amendment is not capable of sending back a reference conceived in spite, 
then he is not living up to his constitutional responsibilities. But then 
it is the Presidents loss that he squandered this opportunity. If he had 
done the right thing, he would have earned the plaudits of the people 
instead of being seen, as he continues to be, as someone who has not 
outgrown his political roots.
    
All the same, the people of Pakistan should be grateful for small mercies. 
In a country like Pakistan which has been accursed by the blight of 
military putschism, it is never a good thing to glorify the army. But 
imagine if at this critical juncture  a juncture defined by Rockwood and 
the present incendiary budget  anyone other than General Jehangir Karamat 
had been chief of the army. Imagine if either of the two loyalists who were 
lobbying so hard for the post, Naseer Akhtar or Javed Ashraf Qazi, had 
become chief of the army staff. The mind boggles.
    
That at least was a decision for which the President deserves the nations 
thanks. Had he allowed himself to be influenced by what interested quarters 
in the government wanted, the country would have been in a sorry mess. 
Which is not to say that the country needs a saviour in khaki. Of this 
breed we have had enough. It is only this that the mere presence of an 
upright and competent person in the armys driving seat is creating some 
sort of a balance, however tenuous that this may be, in the affairs of the 
Republic. Otherwise it is not too much to suppose that the last barriers of 
restraint would have been removed from the tree- lined avenues of 
Islamabad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

A few weeks ago I wrote about power-cuts in Karachi and how the erratic 
supply of power had rendered my electric typewriter hors d combat. It was 
a light-hearted attempt to highlight a deadly serious problem.
    
As other columnists will testify, what we write and in whichever mood, 
rarely influence those who are blessed with the authority to alter the 
course of our destiny. I am aware that this column, which is about power-
cuts, will not shake up KESC or WAPDA or whoever. So why am I writing it? 
The alternative would have been to write about the Budget which is an even 
more painful subject.
    
Power-cuts are a familiar part of our tortured lives but this time the cuts 
seem to be far more severe and far more whimsical. There is no pattern to 
them. There is the added misery of a heat wave and this has taken a toll of 
many lives, in the bargain exposing the limitations and incompetence and 
indeed callousness of hospitals, in itself a subject worthy of a separate 
column.
    
In 1987, I reproduced a letter I had received. It was written by Capt. Z.N. 
Mirza, Master Mariner. It is so relevant that it bears reproducing it 
again. He said in his letter that he was an old man now and a sailor to 
boot and in his lonely hours he had been musing about his chances of 
survival in the Hereafter. The process involved much thought for him and he 
listed the problems of the world generally and of this country in 
particular. These were power-cuts, telephones, water shortages, the traffic 
problem, the police high-handedness, the cost of living and price 
increases. He then concluded: When I die, in accordance with what Ive 
learned, I shall report at the Pearly Gates, humbly present my bio-data and 
declare my nationality. The Angel Keeper of the Keys shall say unto to me, 
Pakistani, eh? Welcome, good and stalwart friend, enter Paradise... Youve 
had your share of hell!
    
There is about the power-cuts this time a certain bloody- mindedness as if, 
the KESC has just washed its hands off the whole business, given up the 
ghost. There isnt even an attempt to explain their position or hold out 
any hope, even though we know that it would be false hope. But why should 
we expect the KESC to function efficiently when the entire infrastructure 
of the city is crumbling? Why do we expect miracles from them when nothing 
else seems to work?
    
The power-cuts have aggravated the water shortages but, in their own right, 
there is a major problem of water which has nothing to do with power-cuts. 
The telephones remain as temperamental as ever, working whenever the mood 
strikes them and not working when the mood is off. They appear to have a 
will of their own. Consider simply the condition of the roads and with the 
advent of the rainy season whatever roads we have will be washed away, as 
they are, year after year, whenever it rains. The condition of public 
transport would form a part of the share of hell of Capt. Mirza.
    
One allows for the fact that Karachi has grown out of all recognition. It 
is a mega-city with a population in excess of 10 million. And it has grown 
haphazardly with no semblance of town planning. It has also become one of 
the most polluted cities in the world. The lungs of the city have been 
choked, the parks and playgrounds are fast disappearing. I am frankly 
astonished that Frere Hall is still there and has not been turned into a 
shopping mall. Why have we allowed what was once a lovely city to become a 
gigantic sprawling slum? And I include the posh areas for there is nothing 
posh about them except the rental of the houses. In these posh areas, one 
sees garbage dumps that have been piled up for days, if not months and 
nobody seems to care. Our sense of community appears to have been frozen.
    
I will not dwell on the safety aspects of the city. That there has been 
some improvement cannot be denied but we still get random killings of a 
political nature and the fear persists that the violence can flare up any 
time. But political problems need political solutions and civic problems 
need civic solutions. Why cant the infrastructure be improved? Is it 
because of financial constraints? Or is it simply because we lack the Will?
    
I remember a Federal Secretary telling me as long ago as 1980 that Karachi 
as a functioning city will cease to exist in the nineties. Even then 
Karachi was a bit of a shambles but nothing like it has become. What 
Karachi needs is meaningful social and civic action and not promises and 
rhetoric. We need to bring a sense of order in the city. I admit it is a 
gigantic task but not an impossible one. When I went to Calcutta in 1987, 
it was a dying city and I saw no hope for it. Yet I went there earlier this 
year for the opening ceremony of the World Cup and even allowing for the 
fact that the city had been tarted up for the occasion, there were signs of 
a re-birth of the city. 
   
Somebody had got down to some serious work. I really do not know why we 
cannot have a dependable electricity system in Karachi. I dont know what 
the constraints are or the impediments. But the prospect of having power-
cuts with a vengeance as we are having now is totally unacceptable. We have 
always responded to emergencies by carrying out patch-work repairs and in 
due course of time these very patch-work repairs become a part of the 
problem. Thats the sort of rut we have got ourselves into.

<a name="toge">Pakistan to get $10m as World Cup profit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, June 24: Pakistan and India are expected to get over $10 million 
each as profit from the Sixth World Cup Cricket Tournament hosted jointly 
by the two countries along with Sri Lanka. The overall profits are 
estimated to be around $ 21 million. Both the countries have already 
received $6.5 million, each.
   
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Finance Adviser Mujahid Eshai, who recently 
visited India to discuss and verify the finances of the Pakistan-India-
Lanka Committee (PILCOM), told Dawn that the proposed visit of the Board of 
Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) representatives I. S. Bhindra and J. 
Dalmia to Pakistan this month had to be cancelled due to the pre-occupation 
of the two officials in their own country.

PCB Finance Adviser said that the total estimated revenue of PILCOM was 
over $40 million. Major contributors (about 50 per cent) in that were the 
TV sales. Besides the main sponsors  Indian Tobacco Company (ITC)  had 
contributed eight million pounds  (about $13 million). The sub-sponsors 
 Coca-Cola contributed $3.69 million. The rest of the amount was 
contributed by sub-sponsors and ground advertising etc.
   
While replying to a question Mujahid Eshai said that the total expenditure 
of the World Cup was $18.5 million. So the expected profit was $21.5 
million. Giving details of  the expenses, he said that TV production cost 
$four  million. Guarantee money to ICC, nine full member countries and 23 
associate member countries was estimated to be $8.8 million. Insurance 
obtained cost (premiums paid was $1.012 million. Registration of trade 
marks and advertising cost $0.570 million.. Joint reimbursement tournament 
costs by both India and Pakistan was $two million.
   
Out of the surplus, $13 million have been equally distributed between 
Pakistan and India (as per terms of the agreement). The balance of 
receivables and bank-balances is eight to $8.5 million.
   
While replying to another question, Mujahid Eshai said that Sri Lanka had 
been allowed to get all the revenues for hosting matches besides her share 
of guarantee money. However, due to refusal of Australia and the West 
Indies teams to play matches in that country, Sri Lanka was given $2.5 lakh 
to compensate for the losses. Mujahid Eshai said that the PILCOM would 
decide whether to pursue a claim against the boards of the two countries 
for the loss caused.
   
The PCB Finance Adviser said that the nine full ICC members were getting 
2.5 lakh pounds each as guarantee money. The three associate members  UAE, 
Kenya, Holland  who took part in the World Cup would get 1.25 lakh pounds 
each. The non-playing associate member countries were to get one lakh 
pounds, each.
   
Mujahid Eshai said that he pointed out some errors and omissions to the 
Indian members about the reimbursable statement during his visit there. The 
PILCOM will discuss expenditure of the opening ceremony of the World Cup 
and expenses on guests of the semi-finals. He said that issue of taxes by 
the Indian government was also discussed. The dispute of telecasting the 
matches among World-Tel, Doordarshan and Star TV will be resolved through 
arbitration by Mr N. P. K. Salve. That may also fetch revenue of a few 
million dollars.
   
The deduction of some amount from the guarantee money to be given to some 
teams, who brought more than the permitted number of players and officials 
for participation in the World Cup, was also yet to be decided.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, June 26: Pakistan start their nine-week tour of England tomorrow 
(Thursday) with a 50-over match against the National Cricket Association 
(NCA) England XI at Trowbridge, a small picturesque village in the 
countryside of Wiltshire, and they go onwards to Cardiff for the opening 
first class game against Glamorgan.
    
So far they remain the only team to win a jackpot of Pound 50,000 by 
defeating the counties while on tour in 1992. On their last tour under 
Javed Miandad they were offered the challenge of beating eight counties out 
of twelve. They won nine and thus bagged the jackpot. The present tour 
being brief, Pakistan plays only six major counties and the prize money is 
not that big as the last time.
    
Having arrived in England without much publicity because the second Test 
against India at Lords and the Europe 96 football fever, they have had so 
far peaceful nights and quiet sessions in the nets.
    
After three days of workout and practice at Edgbaston in Birmingham where 
they landed after their successful four-day tour of Holland which ended 
victories for the visitors, the tourists drove into London in the team 
coach on Monday.
    
On Tuesday while practising at Lords they were mobbed by students from 
Eton and Harrow who had occupied the stands for their traditional annual 
game at the home of cricket. It was a fine opportunity for the young school 
boys to have a look at them and seek their autographs.
    
The Pakistan team had come in at Lords after having lunch in the houses of 
parliament along with the Indian touring team and members of the British 
Parliament from the House of Lords and the Commons.
    
They were taken around the historical building and showed around and were 
greeted with speeches made by the members. It was a unique and memorable 
occasion, said Yawar Saeed, the manager of the team.
    
After another practice session yesterday at Lords, the tourists left for 
tomorrows game straight from the ground.

AMSTELVEEN, June 23: Pakistan turned the tables on Great Britain here on 
Sunday with a 3-0 victory which enabled them to take third place in the 
four-nation hockey tournament for the NGM Trophy.
    
Apart from the result which helped avenge the 1-0 defeat on the previous 
day, Pakistans performance looked more reassuring with a change of 
tactics. Instead of trying unavailingly to rush through the middle they 
exploited their wing forwards and the man who inspired them to victory was 
Mohammad Nadeem on the left wing. Mohammed Anis at centre forward scored 
two goals.
    
On the other wing Mohammed Sarwar was equally effective, so was Rahim Khan 
when he replaced him in the second half. In fact by using the width of the 
field Pakistan were able to combine better than on the previous day.
    
Mansoor Ahmad did not again keep goal for Pakistan but they had no worries. 
His deputy Khalid Mohmood discharged his duties with much confidence and 
made several smart saves. He rose to the occasion in the eighth minute by 
saving off Calum Giles at a penalty corner.

Teams were:
    
Pakistan: Khalid Mahmood, Danish Kalim, Rana Mujahid, Mohammed Usman, 
Mohammed Khalid, Irfan Mahmood, Mohammed Rahim Sarwar, Tahir Zaman (Capt), 
Mohammed Anis, Mohammad Shahbaz, Mohammed Nadeem. Subs used: Rahim Khan, 
Aleem Raza.
    
Great Britain: D. Luckes; J. Wyatt, J. Halls, S. Hazlitt, K. Takher, Soma 
Singh J. Shawr. Garcia, R. Thompson, J. Laslett, N. Thompson, Subs used. D. 
Hall, G. Mayer, C.Giles, P. McGjuire.
    
Umpires: P. Von Reth (Holland) and C. Siebrecht (Germany).

<a name="topa">Pakistan to participate in World Snooker Cup</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, June 24: Pakistan will be among the 20 countries participating in 
the 1996 World Snooker Cup, which will held at the Asmari Watergate Hotel 
in Bangkok, Thailand, from Oct 29 to Nov 10 inclusive.
    
This was stated by Ali Asghar Valika, President, Asian Billiard and Snooker 
Federation (ABSF) and Pakistan Billiard and Snooker Association (PBSA), at 
a function held at the Karachi Club to felicitate Ali Asghar Valika for 
being re-elected as the President of the Asian Billiard and Snooker 
Federation.
    
The ABSF & PBSA President said that 12 countries were seeded and eight have 
qualified for the first World Cup snooker contest after the qualifying 
rounds were held earlier this year.
    
Pakistan did not have to qualify, ranked among the 12 seeded countries due 
to the fact that Shokat Ali, the English-based Pakistan cueist, is ranked 
59th in the World Professional rankings. Countries having snooker players 
in the first 64 in the professional rankings, automatically qualified for 
the world cup extravaganza.
    
The 12 seeded countries are : Australia, Canada, England, Malta, New 
Zealand, Northern Ireland, Pakistan, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, South 
Africa, Thailand and Wales. The eight qualifying countries are : Belgium, 
China, Hong Kong, Iceland, Malaysia, Netherlands, Singapore and United Arab 
Emirates (UAE).

Three players will represent each country and will play one frame against 
every player in the pool. 
    
The three players representing Pakistan will be Shokat Ali, Saleh Mohammad 
and Farhan Mirza ranked No.1 and No. 2 respectively. Former world amateur 
champion Mohammad Yusuf, ranked now at No. 3, failed to make the team.</pre>
