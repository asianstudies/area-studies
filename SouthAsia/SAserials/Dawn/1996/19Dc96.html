Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec 16: The Returning Officers will start receiving nomination 
papers from candidates for National and four provincial assemblies from 
Tuesday, Chief Election Commissioner Sardar Fakhr Alam said.
    
Announcing the schedule for February 3 general elections in his televised 
address to the nation, Fakhr Alam said the nomination papers will be 
received up to December 21.
    
Nomination papers will be scrutinised from December 26 to 28; appeals 
against rejection or acceptance of papers can be filed up to December 31 
which will be heard till January 7 and candidates can withdraw their papers 
up to January 8.
    
The final list of candidates will be published on January 9 and polls for 
National and provincial assemblies will be held simultaneously on February 
3.
    
This is for the first time that it has been decided to hold National and 
provincial assemblies elections on the same day, Alam said adding that 28 
out of 33 political parties had suggested to hold the elections on one day. 
It will save election expenses of the government as well as of the 
candidates and save a holiday, he added.
    
Alam said the people of the semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal 
Areas (FATA), bordering Afghanistan, will also for the first time 
participate in the general elections. He said the voters lists were being 
prepared in FATA.
    
Previously only a few thousand Maliks or tribal chiefs were allowed to 
elect eight members of the National Assembly (lower house) and these eight 
members in turn elected equal number of senators.
    
The ballot boxes for National Assembly will be of green colour while for 
provincial assemblies of off-white colour. The voters slips for the 
National Assembly will be of green colour while for provincial assemblies 
these would be white. The ballot boxes will be sealed in the presence of 
the candidates or their agents before the start of polling. Two polling 
officers and two assistant presiding officers will be deputed at every 
polling booth.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Azizullah Sharif

KARACHI, Dec 17: The election process kicked off on Tuesday with the 
display of election schedule at the offices of returning officers as well 
as the distribution of nomination papers for the national and provincial 
assemblies.
    
Most of the nomination papers, particularly by candidates belonging to 
political parties, are likely to be submitted over the last two days of the 
schedule, not only because the parties are still busy in making alliances 
or seat adjustments with one another but also on account of a plethora of 
new conditions imposed on prospective candidates like various declarations 
and affidavits which must now be submitted with the nomination papers. 
   
Since the new format requiring the contestants to make a number of 
declarations on oath obviously make the job of commission officials 
extremely complicated, observers believe they may have to seek expert 
legal help to cope with the workload related. Even the political parties 
may need lawyers help in filling in the nomination forms.
    
Nomination papers during the first two days of the schedule are usually 
submitted either by independent candidates or those who often pull out 
before the polls, commented a senior election officer. The major parties 
step in during the last two days of the schedule.
    
The new format has been imposed under the recent amendments made in the 
Representation of Peoples Act, 1976.
    
A candidate is now required to declare on oath that he, his wife or 
children or parents have not defaulted on repayment of loans to any bank, 
DFI, co-operative society etc., for more than a year.
    
A contestant will also have to declare on oath that he got no loan written 
off except in case of natural calamities allowed under the directives of 
government.
    
Through yet another declaration, a candidate is required to declare that he 
has not been a defaulter of taxes, government dues, utility bills, for more 
than six months. He is also to give details of his assets, wealth tax, the 
national taxation number (NTN), educational qualification, the NID number, 
etc.
    
Moreover, the candidates will also have to make a statement that they also 
meet conditions mentioned under Articles 62 and 63 of the constitution 
which pertains to qualification or disqualification for the members of 
parliament.
    
Since whosoever will not meet the conditions of Articles 62 and 63 will be 
subjected to disqualification, it is expected that some political parties 
will be hiring the services of lawyers so that nomination papers of their 
candidates are not declared invalid, sources observed.

<a name="noca">No case received against Benazir, Nawaz: Mirza</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec 18: The Ehtesab Commission has not received any case against 
the deposed prime minister Ms. Benazir Bhutto or her spouse Asif Ali 
Zardari or any other mainstream political figure, Chief of the Commission 
Justice (retd) Mujaddid Mirza said on Wednesday.
    
Speaking at his first press conference after assuming the office of the 
chief of the Commission, he disclosed that six to seven cases of corruption 
were ripe and would be referred to accountability tribunals within next few 
days.
    
Justice Mirza disclosed that the Commission was examining cases of 52 ex-
parliamentarians who had jointly purchased medicines worth Rs. 60 million.

Justice Mirza said that he was surprised to learn that the medical bill of 
these ex-parliamentarians was to the tune of Rs.60 million. I was 
intrigued to know what disease these ex-legislators have been suffering 
from, he said.
    
He said so far only two cases, one against former federal minister Haji 
Nawaz Khokhar and the other ex-chairman of the OGDC Rifat Askari have been 
referred to a tribunal, he said.
    
Justice Mirza did not disclose the nature of cases or the people involved 
in these cases to be referred to the tribunal. However, he disclosed that 
Mr. Khokhar with the connivance of five revenue officers had not paid 
duties amounting to Rs.8 million while acquiring a piece of 150 kanals of 
land in the outskirts of federal capital.
    
Nawaz Khokar, he said, in another case had exchanged 69 kanals of land with 
one kanal of land.

<a name="shco">SHC orders release of Zardari</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
KARACHI, Dec 18: Sindh High Court on Wednesday ordered the release of Asif 
Ali Zardari by declaring the order of his detention illegal.
    
Asif Zardari had been under detention since Nov 5 under the Maintenance of 
Public Order Ordinance 1960.
    
The habeas corpus petition was filed by Mrs Faryal Talpur, sister of the 
detainee, through Farooq H. Naek, on Nov 28, challenging the detention of 
her brother by the caretaker government.

He further argued that on the date the detention order was passed in 
Karachi the detainee was already under detention in Rawalpindi under the 
same ordinance.
    
The deputy commissioner, Karachi South, while passing the order didnt 
apply his mind and issued the order in a cyclostyled manner, merely on the 
opinion of the police functionaries, without recording the reasons for his 
detention, he said.
    
The order of detention was passed without jurisdiction and in contravention 
of the law laid down by the superior courts.

Mr Naek further argued that under Section 3 of the MPO Ordinance 1960, a 
person could only be detained if he was acting or about to act in a manner 
which was prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order.
    
He said no material had been produced which could show that the detainee 
was acting or about to act in a manner which was prejudicial to public 
safety.

LAHORE, Dec 12: Pakistan Muslim League President Nawaz Sharif said here on 
Thursday that his removal from the political scene in the name of 
accountability will be disastrous for the country and would amount to 
blocking the process of elections.
    
But Ms Benazir Bhutto, he said, must face the consequences of what she and 
her government had done to the nation. Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari 
should be punished for the loss of billion of rupees to the national 
exchequer caused by them for engineering a default against my family as 
part of my political victimisation, Mr Sharif told a news conference.
    
He demanded that the government should monetarily compensate his family for 
the loss caused to its industries which would have contributed to the 
countrys revenues. In reply to a question, he said he estimated a loss of 
Rs4.5 to Rs5 billion, and pointed out that a case to this effect was 
pending in a law court.

<a name="cash">Cash seizure from Asif denied </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Dec 14: The Pakistan Rangers have denied having recovered any 
amount or any briefcase containing cash from (former) federal minister Asif 
Ali Zardari on the night between Nov 4 and Nov 5.
    
In his para-wise comments and report to the Lahore High Court, the 
director-general of Rangers, in fact, refuted the very allegation that his 
force raided the Governors House, Lahore, that fateful night.
    
The report came on a writ petition filed by Advocate M D Tahir for recovery 
of Rs 700 million allegedly seized from Mr Zardari at the time of his 
arrest from the Governors House, Lahore. The former prime ministers 
husband was allegedly carrying the amount in a briefcase for buying the 
loyalties of Punjab Assembly members on the eve of a confidence vote sought 
by Mr Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo.
    
Reports appearing soon after the Benazir Bhutto governments ouster also 
said that about 26 maunds of gold, being smuggled out by Mr Zardari, were 
also intercepted and brought back from Karachi to the Dry Port at Lahore.
    
Advocate M D Tahir has also sought the surrender of the seized gold, and a 
deputy collector of customs is to appear before the high court on Dec 17 to 
clarify his departments position. The petitioner-lawyer has alleged that 
about 1,430 pieces of antiques, mainly busts, were also reportedly being 
smuggled out together with gold, they, too, have reportedly been brought 
back from Karachi to the Lahore Dry Port in a container.

<a name="bena">Benazir fears for Asifs life</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 12: Deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto met her interned 
husband Asif Ali Zardari in the Landhi jail on Thursday for over an hour.
    
This was their second meeting in less than a week for which special 
permission had been obtained. Unlike the previous meeting, which was held 
across three rows of wire-mesh and bars, this was held face to face in the 
jail superintendents office.
    
Briefly talking to newsmen afterwards Ms Bhutto expressed the apprehensions 
that there could be a conspiracy to poison her imprisoned husband. She said 
she had come to know of this conspiracy at Nao dero and had told Mr Zardari 
to be careful with the food given to him in the prison.

The ousted prime minister said the caretakers were trying to wriggle out of 
their commitment to hold elections on Feb 3, and declared that her party 
would not let them do so.  We will launch a movement if they did so, Ms 
Bhutto said.

<a name="chal">Challenging task for EC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Izharul Hasan Burney

THE Election Commission will record several firsts when it conducts Feb 3 
general election and will need extraordinary mobilisation and the best of 
luck to come out unscathed.
    
Besides the maiden experience of Same Day poll for the national and the 
provincial assemblies, the task becomes more challenging on account of the 
timing and the extremely unfavourable weather during this part of the year.
    
Weather-wise, it will be the coldest part of season with snowfall in many 
parts of the northern region including Quetta Valley and mercury close to 
zero in the NWFP and most parts of the Punjab and Balochistan.
    
Add to it the fact that it will be the third week of the holy month of 
Ramazan posing electioneering problems to the contesting candidates / 
political parties which in our case depend so much on public meetings, 
rallies, processions, etc.  most of these at night.
    
The faithful will detest any of these engagements in the afternoon when 
they prepare for Iftar. Thereafter it is the busy two-hour schedule up to 
taraveeh, followed by much needed rest; late night nawafil and recitation 
of the Holy Quran for quite many of them.
    
The problems of the Election Commission will however be manifold. Polling 
hours have been fixed from 7 am to 4 pm (nine hours without break). But 
much serious issues are involved in this exercise.
    
But the next problem will be when the polling ends and the sorting and 
counting of votes begins. That will be close to Iftar time. Tempers will be 
high; so also the work in hand. There will have to be a break. That can 
give cause of grievance and suspicion.
    
And there has to be demand for yet another short break for taraveeh from 
the representatives of the contesting candidates as well as the polling 
officers. Could the counting process be suspended at that stage, and how? 
The commission has to be well prepared for all such situations.
    
In the past, the transportation of the sealed ballot bags and other 
election materials from the polling stations to the offices of the 
returning officers has been a badly managed affairs. The commission can 
ill-afford it this time as the polling officers and the candidates 
representatives would be in a hurry to get back home for the much needed 
rest and the Sehri for next days fasting.

<a name="piap">PIA, PTCL, PR, banks to be privatised in 50 days</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec 15 : The Privatisation Commission has finalised regulatory 
framework to privatise within next 50 days PIA, Pakistan Railways, 
airports, PTCL, banks and couple of other state owned enterprises.

While we are speeding up existing transactions, we have worked out a plan 
to disinvest major public sector corporations like PIA, Railways etc. in a 
shortest possible time, said the new Chairman of the Privatisation 
Commission, Dr. Suliman Shah.

In an interview with Dawn here on Sunday he said the regulatory framework 
was urgently being put in place to get the job done quickly.

He said since the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) and 
Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) have been separated, the share 
price of the PTCL had considerably increased. Market reaction is very good 
and more PTCL share are selling, he added.

Answering a question he said that caretakers have speeded up the 
privatisation process and as  a first step we will have an autonomous 
board for Pakistans Railways for its early privatisation.

This board will work as a commercial group which will have track company, 
freight and passenger company and a manufacturing company, the Chairman 
Privatisation Commission added.

Talking about the PIA, Dr. Suliman said that International Finance 
Corporation (IFC) has been given the task of looking into its various 
operations. He said that the services of the IFC have been hired to reform 
the entire PIA.

We have decided to have an alliance of some foreign airlines with PIA to 
improve its image and modernise its ageing fleet, he stated.

He further disclosed that a decision has been taken to offer at least 25 
per cent PIA shares to some foreign airline to get its management improved 
and bring new technology and better marketing skills. He said 50 per cent 
of its shares will be floated for general public.

<a name="natu">Nature of Burki mission and its achievements</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi

The FULL results of Shahid Javed Burkis mission to Washington will soon be 
known. His very accession to the top economic and financial slot in this 
country, ostensibly temporarily, and on loan from his employers, the World 
Bank, smoothed the ruffled feathers in the IMF management vis-`-vis their 
relationship with this country.
    
The success of his mission, it seems, was built into the politics of what 
happened on Nov. 5 last. The question is the nature and extent of what has 
Mr Burki achieved in the worlds monetary and financial capital.
    
What is known is that he has gone, at least, to ensure the resuscitation of 
the December 1995 IMFs Standby Arrangement that was suspended in February 
this year; at least two tranches worth $ 160 million are overdue  and in 
one version $ 320 million. 
    
Moreover, Mr Burki is keen to, at least, start the negotiations for another 
ESAF agreement with the IMF for the likely $ 1.5 billion 3-year credit on 
easier terms. That, it is said, will radiate the right signals all around 
to enable his other expectations to come true. What are these?
    
He is known to have desired to build up the monetary reserves to the $1 
billion level by the end of December 1996  a distinctly modest aspiration. 
But it is not so very modest an objective if it is remembered that quite a 
few heavy payments liabilities have to be discharged before the year runs 
out.

Heavy payments
    
How much is not known? What is known is that payments in hard currencies 
have to be made on several counts, some as heavy as $ 500 million or 
somewhat more. Therefore a safe guess will be $800 million, although a 
little bird tells me that the total figure might be much closer to $1 
billion, if regard is to be had of having to pay interest on all the short-
term credits this country has had to contract. 
    
So, building up reserves of $ 1 billion after making all those payments 
would seem to require obtaining credits of the order of $2 billion and more 
before the year says good-bye. One can only express admiration for Mr 
Burkis abilities and sang-froid.
    
Doubtless, his capacity to raise credits seems immense. 
    
Suddenly a disclosure was made that UAE was going to make a loan of $350 
million in BoP support. It came at a time when one was wondering why 
Pakistans traditional friends and supporters did not come forward, or were 
approached, even at a time when monetary reserves were depleting fast.
    
And if the UAE has come forward, or agreed to, will Saudi Arabia, Kuwait 
and or Oman not like to chip in with more, though it would be good to know 
who took the first initiative regarding the UAE credit and what precise 
shape it will take, especially its rate of interest.

Building reserves
    
It is also known that the aim of Mr Burki is to build up monetary reserves 
of the order of $3 billion by Feb 3 next year. That build-up would require 
somewhere between $ 4 and 5 billion being raised during these caretaker 90 
days  because provision for further repayments, again roughly of the order 
of another $1 billion, must necessarily be also made first. But the common 
assessment is that given the general acceptability of the present World 
Bank officials team in the BWIs  as insiders  it should not be too 
difficult.
    
So Pakistans caretaker regime will leave something like $3 billion reserve 
when we, hopefully, will see their back. But by that time, by my back-of-
envelope calculations, our quarterly payments liabilities will have 
increased by at least $ 50 to 60 million per quarter. But that burden will 
be felt after March next year, if not later still in the June to September 
quarter. But the question to be asked is, if this is the answer to all 
Pakistans prayers? What Mr Burki is doing and is proposing to do is to 
borrow more from no matter where.
    
Other questions also arise. Is this a solution? Pakistan at the end of 1996 
will stand indebted to the tune of about $32 billion or more on a more or 
less long-term basis. In addition, its short-term loans  frowned upon by 
all including BWIs would amount to an estimated level of $ 7 to 8 billion, 
thanks largely to the borrowing efficiency of the Burki team.

Increase in liabilities
    
The net result will be a big increase in debt servicing liabilities  both 
for interest at about 5 to 6 per cent for short term loans and a proportion 
of repayment of the principal  say about $500 million or more per quarter 
in additional burdens or nearly doubling todays.
    
The real skills demanded of the new Finance Minister will be to go on 
borrowing hard both for the longer term and for short term purposes. All 
his time is sure to be spent in worrying about getting new and servicing of 
older loans.
    
However, a question that needs to be asked is: is the BoP problem the only 
problem before the common people of this country? What is in it for the 
common people in all this; not a penny of it will reach any Pakistanis 
pocket. The BoP has little to do with the life of a common man: his import 
requirements are extremely limited; not even all the food-item imports are 
meant for him, except perhaps a small part of edible oil and perhaps tea 
imports. And when that is allowed for, his interest can only go up only 
marginally.
    
He is far more interested in other problems: endemic large-scale 
unemployment, poverty, illiteracy and ill health of his children and wife. 
The caretakers can remonstrate: why do people always come up with 
absolutely impractical, permanent and structural problems? So the common 
citizen raises his immediate problems: spiralling prices and ever-
increasing taxes and charges he has to pay. Why should he undergo these 
hardships and what does he get in return for all his miseries?
    
Would Mr Burki enlighten him why should he go on paying the ever higher 
prices and ever more indirect aimed-at-himself taxes when he is not being 
looked after by any state policy or scheme. 
    
It is the small man who ultimately pays all the indirect taxes that are the 
bulk of the countrys taxes and who gets nothing from the state  not even 
good law and order or an effective administration of justice.

People suffering
    
The question of questions is: why should the common folk go on paying 
through their nose for everything they do not need or use: they get 
virtually no help in transport, food, medicines, school fees, cloth, 
hospitals charges, no assistance from government hospitals, or in securing 
a job, getting training, or even guidance. 
  
The government is they in Islamabad which do unknown and unrelated 
things.
    
The fact of the matter is that the solution that Mr Burki is implementing 
is what Ms Benazir Bhutto and V.A. Jafarey would have done more or less 
just as well. Even the BWIs would have, in the end, co-operated if they 
could be convinced that all their wishes were not supreme and that the 
state of Pakistan exists not for BWIs but for the people of the country. It 
is the powers that be above the nominal government that bowed before all 
the venial wishes of the BWIs. 
    
So we are where we are. But where are we? The question is what will be the 
net achievement of the loaned World Bank team by February 3, next?
    
Well, they are not tackling the problem of capacity utilisation. They are 
not tackling structural unemployment. They are not tackling the land tenure 
system. They are not tackling low productivity of labour or machines. They 
are not attending to the costs of production. They are not looking at 
managements modernisation. Nor are they worried about the low savings and 
low domestic investments. Can foreign investments really come in a big way 
when Pakistanis are not investing in their own country? In short, what are 
the caretakers taking care of? Only the BoP, important as it is!
    
There is no doubt that the BoP is extremely important  for the state and 
some people abroad. But, pray, do let us attend to some of our real 
problems that blight the lives of a vast majority of Pakistanis. After all, 
there must be some examination of why this country is in the BoP crisis it 
is?
    
Are common Pakistanis responsible for the mess their governments have made 
over the decades? If not, why should their resolution of government created 
problems put ever more burdens on the common folk? Let those whose actions, 
privileges and corruption has brought Pakistan to the straits it is in, pay 
for its rescue. Instead, it is the common Pakistanis who are being asked to 
foot the bill for this rescue operation. Why is it so?

Poor to pay
    
Well, more loans will have to be repaid? The money will come from new or 
more taxes, user charges, higher duties or cess. Who will pay is obvious. 
No rich man pays any direct tax honestly; the government has to resort to 
indirect taxes, cesses and surcharges, excise duties and the like, for the 
common citizen to pay. But mighty little is being attempted to set right 
Pakistans real structural problems, as mentioned a while ago.
    
Do the poor people of Pakistan know their true cash payments liability for 
the new year, 1997, that is almost upon us. One does not mean the figures 
shown in the 1996-97 Budget; we all know that it is, by Dec 96, a dated 
document.
    
The real requirement on external account alone have exceeded all its 
projections. It is sure to be wrong on the domestic debt servicing count 
too. But one is referring to the total allocated amount of external debts 
repayment of the principal and especially interest.
    
What we need to know is the actual total that includes servicing of the 
short term loans including what SBP borrows to balance its books. Knowing 
the overall figure for the year would correct many impressions, especially 
as there seems to be no emphasis on increasing the economys capacity to 
repay. But someone will ultimately pay even when the Burkis of today are 
borrowing to pay interest charges. Who will it be?

<a name="dono">Donors oppose WB action in Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec 15: Pakistans major bilateral donors including Japan and 
Canada have taken strong exception to attempts by the World Bank to force 
the government of Pakistan to slash even the core projects of other donors 
simply to protect the Banks aided projects from being affected by the 
decision to curtail the development budget this year by Rs.21 billion.

The missions of the two countries in Islamabad are said to have advised 
their respective governments to take up the matter with the World Bank. 
These missions are said to have already lodged a strong protest with 
Pakistan on the matter.

The government had decided to curtail the development allocations for 1996-
97 by a hefty margin to bring down the budgetary deficit to 4 per cent of 
the GDP this year as envisaged in the understanding reached with the IMF on 
October 22.

The original decision was to have the saving of Rs.21 billion made through 
the stoppage of work on non-core projects irrespective of donor source.

However, soon after the take over of the finance ministry by a World Bank 
Vice President now on three months leave, a new exercise was reportedly 
conducted in the ministry which virtually retrieved all the World Bank 
aided projects and in the process even projects having immediate socio-
economic benefits but funded by bilateral donors were slashed.

<a name="imfr">IMF restores standby credit facility to Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai   
  
WASHINGTON, Dec 17: The IMF on Tuesday announced restoration and 
enhancement of Pakistans suspended standby credit, increasing the total 
amount to be disbursed by an additional $ 231 million to $550 million until 
September next year.

The IMF will now disburse a total of $550 million to Pakistan until 
September 1997, of which $ 320 million would be the amount due from the 
previous arrangement and $ 231 million would be the increase, a Pakistan 
official told Dawn.
    
The IMF announcement said the programme supported by the standby credit was 
designed to reduce Pakistans macro-economic imbalances and to address a 
range of structural issues.
    
The press release issued by the Fund said the achievement of these 
objectives had been undermined by slippages in policy implementation in 
1995-96 and the first four months of 1996-97.

<a name="doll">Dollarisation of economy rises from 2.6 to 14%</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Dec 17: The dollarisation of Pakistans economy, measured by the 
ratio of resident Foreign Currency Deposits (FCDs) to total domestic 
liquidity, rose steeply from 2.6% to about 14% during the first half of 
1990s.
    
This was stated by the Commerce Minister, Dr Mohammad Zubair Khan, in a 
study presented at a seminar of economists held here recently.
    
In the paper, he dwelled on the implications for policy making of the use 
of foreign exchange as a store of value, commonly referred to as 
dollarisation.
    
While reviewing the prospects for private capital flows in Pakistan and the 
options available to the State Bank for managing the effects thereof, Dr 
Zubair noted that the total private capital inflows increased from $2.3 
billion (5.2% of GDP) in 1990-91 (prior to the inflow phenomenon) to a peak 
of $4.5 billion (8.7% of GDP) in 1993-94.
    
However, in the subsequent year, these subsided somewhat to $4.3 billion 
(7.1% of GDP) in 1994-95. Inflows financed 68% of the current account 
deficit (excluding workers remittances and Resident Foreign Currency 
Deposits) in 1990-91, and nearly 115% of the current account deficit in 
1993-94.
    
The author noted that workers remittances, FDI and resident FCDs represent 
considerable stable forms of inflows. But the most striking feature of 
private capital flows into Pakistan, according to him, was that portfolio 
investment, non-resident currency deposits and other short-term capital 
present a potential risk of a reversal of flows in a very short-term.
    
The flow reversal can create a banking crisis and result in both exchange 
rate and interest volatility. If the State Bank lacks an adequate stock of 
international reserves to meet the inflow, it may trigger a balance of 
payments crisis.
    
Already, the ratio of banking system reserves to cumulate volatile inflows 
declined from 1.27 in 1990-91 to 0.69 in 1992-93 and then remained below 
0.8 in subsequent years. The same ratio excluding FCDs (a component which 
has displayed greater stability in recent years) peaked at 2.89 in 1992-93, 
but declined to 1.42 in 1994-95.
    
The ratio of exposure warns of a weak reserve base to support growing 
capital inflows, whose composition is rapidly changing towards the more 
volatile components, Dr Zubair remarked.

<a name="inve">Investors rush on IMF news helps stocks resist decline</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 16: Stocks on Monday resisted larger decline as investors 
rushed in to cover positions at the lower levels on news that the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF) will soon release stuck up credit of $60m 
under the standby arrangement.
    
However, some others said it was a welcome gesture to the election victory 
of Arif Habib who was voted to power on Sunday for the second-term as 
president of the Karachi Stock Exchange.
    
Although his victory was narrow, by five votes, but the important factor 
was that he defeated a very strong opponent, as analysts earlier predicted 
even chances and a close fight, which proved true.
    
The KSE 100-share index, however, showed a smart recovery as some of the 
leading base shares rose appreciably, finishing higher by 15.94 points at 
1,407.87 as compared to 1,391.93 a day earlier.
    
Analysts, however, doubted the markets ability to sustain any run-up, even 
technical one, at this stage as the uncertain conditions will not allow 
investors to make bigger commitments.
    
The rally could be deceptive as it is not backed by objective positive 
background news, they added but did not rule out the possibility of strong 
selective support on the blue chip counters.
    
Most of the blue chips and leading shares have hit the bottom and ripe for 
technical correction but investors might think twice before committing 
themselves in a big way.
    
The entire trading activity appeared to be a jobbing affair as political 
uncertainty and some other negative news kept investors at their toes all 
the time.
    
Liquidity problems are also there as banks are not that liberal even for 
expensive credit line owing partly to year-end closing, some dealers said.
    
They said alternate bouts of buying and selling have assumed an added 
importance as it is the only scapegoat to avert major losses in the 
situation as the prevailing one.
    
Terribly low institutional support, both from the NIT and ICP owing to 
liquidity crunch, has limited trading options for others who are also 
toeing the general line of action, brokers said.
    
So it is pretty difficult to predict about the direction of the market as 
the situation is fraught with high risks, they added.
    
Most of the rallies were modest and reflected filling in the technical gaps 
here and there but there was no big rebound owing to strong buying.
    
Bank, leasing and some of the insurance shares came in for stray support 
and finished partially recovered and so did some of the leading textile 
shares, notable gainers among Central Insurance, Nazir Cotton, Nishat 
Fabrics and Nishat Mills, Al-Faysal, Schon and Crescent Bank.
    
Synthetic shares were actively traded under the lead of Dewan Salman and 
Dhan Fibre but generally ended with pared off gains.
    
Cement shares came in for stray short-covering at the lower levels on news 
of incentives for exports and recovered under the lead of Kohat, Lucky and 
Pakland Cement.
    
Energy shares were actively traded and marked up modestly, major gainers 
among them being PSO, which soared after being quoted ex-dividend and ex-
bonus at Rs 275.
    
Sui Southern, Hub-Power and National Refinery and some others followed it 
rising on active short-covering.
    
Chemical and pharma shares also performed well after initial weakness and 
managed to look up under the lead of Engro Chemicals, Fauji Fertiliser, ICI 
Pakistan and Sandoz Pakistan, but BOC and some others remained under 
pressure.
    
Blue chips on other counters, notably Brooke Bond, Hinopak Motors, PEL and 
Haji Dossa, also came in for active support and ended recovered.
    
Trading volume showed a modest increase at 28.794 million shares from the 
overnights 23.316m shares, thanks to active short-covering in some 
pivotals.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 30 paisa on 8.631 
million shares, followed by Hub-Power, up 30 paisa on 8.505m, ICI Pakistan, 
steady 10 paisa on 4.960m, Dhan Fibre, firm 10 paisa on 1.810m, and FFC-
Jordan Fertiliser, easy five paisa on 1.165m shares.
    
There were 311 actives out of which 139 shares fell, 104 rose with 68 
holding on to the last levels.

<a name="ehte">Ehtesab or Intekhab?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

PROGRESS! PTV is now willing to risk a live discussion, obviating 
censorship. So when Ayaz Amir asked if I would appear on his weekly 
programme Mizaan, together with two political stalwarts from our two 
corruption-riddled majority political parties, I unhesitatingly said yes. 
The front rankers sidled off, the second tier were reluctant, but turned 
up.
    
We had long-winded Raza Rabbani, who skilfully conveyed absolutely nothing, 
and the relatively likeable Chaudhry Nisar who did attempt some sort of 
remorse. But in the main, their theme was: corruption is merely public 
perception fuelled by the media. Emulating their leaders, they threw down 
the gauntlet: produce proof, catch me if you can.
    
My theme: thieves never ever give receipts. And, had the last three 
horrible governments not mercilessly and massively robbed the national 
exchequer, the country might now not be staggering and broke. Where has all 
the money gone?
    
Our caretakers are a mottled crew. People accept the President, 
disregarding his shortcomings, because he finally did act to save what was 
left of the country. The majority seems now prepared to overlook his past 
conduct and alleged misdeeds. But many of the caretakers are unacceptable, 
including the Caretaker Prime Minister, as loose a cannon as Benazir and 
Nawaz, though less wily and wicked.
    
One continues to be amazed at how fast heat rises from the power seat. The 
caretakers came on November 5. The next morning, Talented Brother-in-law, 
Commerce Minister Zubair, had it conveyed to the then Chairman of the 
Capital Development Authority, Zafar Iqbal, that he wished to immediately 
have carpeted the service lane, a roughly paved pedestrian-cycling path, 
that runs along the side of his house linking 90th Street to 91st Street 
(off Attaturk Avenue). Transformers at each end of the lane allowed no 
vehicular traffic.
    
Vitiating and violating the Islamabad master plan, the transformers were 
moved to the sides, a vehicular two-way road was created (though two cars 
cannot possibly cross), and named Street 90-A. The purpose was to allow 
Omar Farooque, Zubairs relative, direct access to his house situated 
behind Zubairs house, access to which was via Zubairs gate on Street 90. 
Work was directed to be completed by the evening of the 7th, and it was. 
Farooque now has a spanking new gate on Street 90-A.
    
Could this have been accomplished in any capital of a democratic country? 
Whenever one talks about Zubair one is reminded of the old saying: Sari 
khudai aik taraf; Joru ka bhai aik taraf.
    
Caretaker Communications Minister Ghaffar Jatoi has managed to have a park-
sized amenity plot (ST-11 Block 9 Kekhashan Scheme 5, opposite the Mideast 
hospital) and measuring some 15,000 sq. yds. converted into a commercial 
plot and allotted to himself at a ridiculously low price (the process was 
commenced in the days of Abdullah Shah).
    
Efficient Caretaker Law Minister Fakhruddin Ebrahim would seem to have 
virtually sabotaged the disqualification process. The ordinance he drafted 
is heavily diluted in comparison to that promulgated by Benazir. It will 
succeed in letting quite a few wrong-doers off the hook. For instance, in 
Benazirs ordinance, any person holding over 10 per cent shares of a 
defaulting concern stood disqualified, whereas Fakhruddins ordinance only 
disqualifies a person holding the majority share, i.e. over 51 per cent.
    
Should the President wish the people to respect his standing, whatever it 
be, he must have Zubairs service lane restored, cancel Jatois foul 
allotment, and have the disqualification ordinance redrafted. If 
credibility is to be maintained, the offending caretakers and those 
acquiescing should be sent home.
    
Reverting to the disqualification ordinance, it has to be tailored, 
stringently and ruthlessly, to suit the circumstances  nine out of ten, in 
all good conscience, can be legitimately disqualified. The ordinance must 
cater for this. No one is being convicted and jailed; they are merely being 
disqualified from posing again as public representatives, entitled to rob 
and loot the country.
    
To illustrate: The President was prevailed upon to sanction the transfer of 
9,154 acres of state land, with a seafront of 1,000 ft, to the Pakistan 
Navy for the use of their naval base, PNS Nathiagali, at Cape Monze 
(20/4/95). Out of the blue, Captain Liaquat Malik of Naval HQ returned 100 
acres to the Sindh government, saying it was no longer required by the 
Navy (10/10/95). The Chief Minister of Sindh allotted these 100 acres 
(484,000 sq. yds.) to Mst Muneeza Shaikh, w/o Tufail Shaikh (Tony Casino), 
Adviser to the Chief Minister of Sindh, at Rs 6 per sq. yd. for the 
construction of a tourist complex, in relaxation of existing 
policy/ban/rules (24/10/95). Captain Liaquat Malik instructed COMKAR to 
hand over 100 acres along the length of the entire seafront (30/11/95).
    
The Presidents men are divided, rightly or wrongly, as to whether to 
complete the process of Ehtesab, to weed out the corrupt and then hold 
elections, or to hold Intekhab, and continue from there. The realists know 
that if Intekhab comes first, the process will cease once the freely and 
fairly elected again come in to hold the country to ransom. Should this 
happen?
    
Our Constitution was not written by the hand of God. It was written, 
amended, amended again, and again, by self-perpetuating mortals to condone 
their misrule. As Chief Justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah said from the 
Bench the other day, the same constitutional Articles can be interpreted 
differently at different times, to suit the current situation. He said this 
in full knowledge of how various Articles have wickedly and selfishly been 
misread and misused over the years. Elections within 90 days were not 
inscribed for a situation where nine out of ten can safely be disqualified. 
The cardinal issue is that all that has been written in the Constitution 
must be interpreted for the betterment of the people, so that their 
travails may be lessened and they may be granted, as far as is possible, 
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
 
For whatever reasons it may have been inserted, Article 58(2-B) is a must 
if we are to try to aim for true democracy rather than the travesty we have 
suffered since 1988. It was used against Benazir in 1990 and 1996, against 
Nawaz in 1993  on each occasion, to many a mind, correctly applied, as it 
at least gave the country breathing space, preventing total collapse and 
chaos.
    
We have never had true democracy. To quote Paula Newburg (Los Angeles 
Times, December 9), Once again the country is scrambling to adjust to 
another interim government, once again, disputatious politicians are 
risking the countrys political future... Elections dont make democracy, 
democratic behaviour does, obeying the law, placing collective needs above 
personal gain, conserving and sharing resources, acknowledging differences 
of opinion. Once again, politics has stopped just short of a precipice. If 
Pakistans politicians dont put their house in order someone else might  
and then no one will be satisfied. The lesson is clear.
    
Never have we been nearer the edge of the precipice. The people must be 
taken into confidence and their will must prevail. A direct reference must 
be made and this caretaker government must ascertain what it is the masses 
want. The Constitution adequately provides in Article 48(6):
    
If, at any time, the President, in his discretion, or on the advice of the 
Prime Minister, considers that it is desirable that any matter of national 
importance should be referred to a referendum, the President may cause the 
matter to be referred to a referendum in the form of a question that is 
capable of being answered by yes or no.  Like the Fifth Caliph of the 
Abbasid dynasty, Harun-ar-Rashid Ibn Mohammad al-Mahdi Ibn al-Mansur Ibn 
al-Abbasi (766-809), ruler of the Islamic empire at its zenith, our 
President should disguise himself, emerge from his backdoor, mingle with 
the awam of all four provinces and ask what it is they wish: ehtasab or 
intekhab? And which should precede which? He might get a clear, almost 
unanimous, response: Ehtesab! No intekhab without ehtesab! Elections could 
surely be held back for a further six months, by which time the corruption-
riddled institutions of the state dealing with accountability can be 
cleansed, reorganised and reactivated.
    
The people are the final arbiters of their destiny and that of their 
country. It is for them to decide whether elections should be held in 
haste, haphazardly, or whether they should be held so as to ensure that the 
rot does not set in again.

Omar Kureishi

EVER since we have had television in this country, it has been shamelessly 
used to project the government and to deify its rulers and to create a cult 
of personality. There were no exceptions, no pauses and, therefore, this 
practice has become entrenched and it can be said that a precedent has been 
set, albeit a bad precedent.
    
It is all but impossible to unset it. The opposition cries foul and vows to 
restore the balance. It does not when the torch is passed to them. It is 
willy-nilly accepted by the viewers that since it was always thus, it will 
remain thus. Those who are promising to abolish VIP culture should give 
some thought to television for there is no better example of VIP culture 
than Khabarnama.
    
No matter what happens in the world, some country can drop an atomic bomb 
on another, the first lead on Khabarnama will be one of the rulers, laying 
a foundation stone, presiding over a committee meeting or receiving some 
supposed distinguished visitor. The chances are that the nuking of a city 
wont even be the second lead. It is not that the people in charge of 
Khabarnama do not have news sense. They do not have the independence. They 
are helpless and stuck with what is really an audio-visual press release. I 
have always found it unfair that it is PTV that has to bear the brunt of 
criticism for Khabarnama.
    
But there is a lot that PTV could have done, both to educate and entertain 
the viewers, to change social attitudes and indeed to fight corruption, not 
necessarily at the penthouse level for that would not have been allowed but 
at lower levels where it really hits the common folk. Two of the best TV 
programmes, at least in my opinion, were Alif Noon and Fifty-Fifty. They 
were genuinely funny programmes but they packed a hefty social punch. Their 
strength came from the fact that they dealt with problems with which the 
people could identify. This is what satire is about. I remember once that I 
had been tipped off that Fifty-Fifty was planning to do a take-off on PIA 
and it was suggested that I approach the powers-that-were to get the Fifty-
Fifty people to cease and desist.
    
I didnt think it was a good idea at all and argued that if the programme 
took the micky out of PIA, it would do nothing but good. Our employees 
needed to see what others thought about them and if the programme sent up 
PIA, the PIA may come down from its pedestal. Not everyone agreed with me 
but I did nothing to stop the programme. In fact it gave me an idea to do 
an in-house cartoon book, the thrust of which was that if you (the PIA 
employee) were a passenger, how would you like to be treated? I exaggerated 
situations, like the booking-office staff drinking tea and playing cards 
while a queue of customers were waiting. This did not win managements 
favour. But it was a good idea and was better than all the exhortations we 
subjected the employees to from time to time.
    
But without any question, the best satirical programme was Yes Minister 
that PTV showed and then stopped showing because our own bureaucracy felt 
that it was too close to home. I thought of Yes Minister, and indeed the 
subject of this column, because rummaging through some of my old stuff, I 
found a copy of the book that had been brought out, the printed version of 
Yes Minister. And I read it with the same enjoyment as I used to get when 
watching the television programme. Yes Minister series achieved a unique 
hat trick: it became the first programme ever to win the British Academy 
award for the Best Comedy series for three years running. As was said about 
Yes Minister the series had progressed from an innovation to an 
institution, as more and more people realised that behind the laughter 
there was a great deal of accurate observation and pertinent revelation 
about the way the British are governed.
    
The principal characters are Jim Hacker, the Minister for Administrative 
Affairs, Sir Humphrey Appleby, the Permanent Under-Secretary and Bernard 
Woolley, the Principal Private Secretary. Yes Minister is about the 
attempts of the Minister to assert himself and how he is obstructed by the 
civil servants. The dialogue and indeed the inter-action is hilarious but 
bears a strong resemblance to actuality. Sir Humphrey informs the Minister 
that he is not there to run the Department. In an exchange of inter-office 
memos between Sir Humphrey and Bernard Woolley, Sir Humphrey makes the 
observation: These meetings (with junior staff) must be stopped at once. 
If the Minister talks to underlings he may learn things that we dont know 
ourselves. Our whole position could be undermined. Here are some more 
guidelines. There is the law of Inverse Relevance: the less you intend to 
do about something, the more you have to keep talking about it. On Open 
Government: if people do not know what you are doing, they dont know what 
you are doing wrong. There is the Light-in-the-Refrigerator syndrome, i.e. 
is the light on when the door is shut? The only way to find out is to open 
the door in which case the door is not shut any more.
    
I am sure that our own bureaucracy (which was given to us by the British) 
follows this model, adjusting to local conditions. For instance, if you try 
and telephone a bureaucrat, all levels, you will be told he is in a 
meeting. Even if he is sitting in his office, listening to cricket 
commentary, he is deemed to be in a meeting.
    
I have tried to induce some of our top television stars to do a Pakistani 
version of Yes Minister. I am not sure whether it will be allowed to be 
aired but it is worth a try. It would be immensely entertaining and may 
bring some of our bureaucrats a peg or two down. I am sure that British 
bureaucracy must have been chastened by Yes Minister. Besides, we could do 
with a laugh or two in these grim times.

<a name="anat">A nation plagued by lawyers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

OF ALL the irrelevant scenes to crowd the life of this unfortunate country 
none is more bizarre than the sight of black-coated lawyers trooping with 
solemn mien to the Supreme Court and there arguing with recondite eloquence 
about issues messed up not by any confusion in the laws but made 
intractable and perverse by the primeval stupidity of their political 
masters.

>From this results another confusion of staggering import. When their 
lordships of the Supreme Court are called upon to adjudicate in matters 
which are more political than legal it is scarcely surprising if the 
judgements they hand down, instead of being carved in stone and therefore 
meant for the ages (as judicial luminaries often flatter themselves by 
thinking that they are), are writ on water and therefore subject to second 
thoughts in a time scale much on this side of eternity.

Thus it is that every dissolution of the National Assembly since 1988 
(barring the present one regarding which the Supreme Court has yet to 
decide) has led to the breaking of fresh constitutional ground. Thus also 
the eel-like flexibility of Pakistans leading lawyers who can move from 
one position to another with a facility that would be the envy of the 
foremost commanders. My friend Mr Sharifuddin Pirzada has defended in his 
time the Doctrine of Necessity (the unwritten law on which all Pakistani 
dictatorships have been based) with as much fervour and conviction as he 
now brings to the cause of democracy. Or take the Ciceronian eloquence of 
Mr Khalid Anwer which was put to one use in 1993, when on behalf of Mian 
Nawaz Sharif, he was arguing against the dismissal of the then National 
Assembly and which is being put to quite another use now because as the 
Presidents counsel he finds himself on the other side of the legal 
barricades. (Or is it that with his Ciceronian eloquence he will convince 
us that whereas the world may be out of joint he remains where he has 
always been?)

Not that constitutional law should remain encased in iron and concrete. To 
keep pace with the times, it must develop and grow. But over the years 
political parties in Pakistan have sought to turn the higher judiciary into 
a laundry for dirty political clothes. They expect the Supreme Court to do 
their cleaning for them when more often than not it is through their folly, 
rather than the malevolence of their stars, that they found themselves in 
the sewers.

Zulfikar Ali Bhutto through his actions and lapses invited military 
intervention in 1977. Having done that he (or rather his wife) went rushing 
to the Supreme Court for succour. In 1988 it was Muhammad Khan Junejo who 
brought upon himself the dissolution of the then National Assembly by 
biting the hand that had fed him and raised him to political glory. A 
politician can be forgiven every sin in the world except closing his eyes 
to reality because dealing with reality and appreciating its contours and 
nuances is the foremost requirement of the political craft.

What was it that brought about Benazir Bhuttos first dismissal in 1990? 
Not some evil genie locked in the Eighth Amendment but her own foolish and 
unthinking ways. Certainly General Aslam Beg and President Ishaq worked 
against her, but they would not have succeeded if her corruption and 
ineptitude (a familiar refrain with Ms Bhutto) had not provided grist to 
their intriguing mills. In Nawaz Sharifs case, his own associates (when 
pressed in private) admit to the mistakes he made and which led to his 
governments dismissal in 1993. As for Benazir Bhutto in 1996, rare would 
be the mortal who could bring himself to say that she did not bring her 
troubles on her own head. When one is clean one can afford to be brave. But 
if temptation is hard to resist, the least one can do is to play a cautious 
hand. Hand it to Ms Bhutto and her husband therefore, who were not only 
audacious about their corruption (the caretakers failure to nab them on 
specific charges notwithstanding) but also heedless about their politics, a 
sure combination to tempt the Fates.

This being the record of the recent past, is it not ironic that when 
political leaders receive what they have richly deserved, they go rushing 
to the Supreme Court for deliverance? By doing so they place the Supreme 
court in an invidious position. If it upholds the Doctrine of Necessity, as 
in 1977, it is accused of pandering to the wishes of a dictator. If it does 
not restore a dismissed National Assembly, as in 1988 and 1990, it finds 
favour in some eyes and condemnation in others. If it provides relief, as 
in 1993, it invites the charge (at least from one side of the political 
spectrum) that it is passing judgement on matters which lie essentially 
within the political sphere.

To interpret the laws and the Constitution is one thing. But since 1988 or, 
to go back further still, since 1977, the higher courts are being expected 
to right political wrongs and rescue political parties from the 
consequences of their own follies. Besides putting an unconscionable burden 
on the courts, such a course of action allows ruling parties to play a 
double role: first as political incompetents and then as judicial martyrs. 
The standard-bearers of Pakistani democracy have done nothing to deserve 
this unreasonable luxury.

If the Eight Amendment is a bad piece of legislative baggage the political 
parties should do something to get rid of it. They certainly cannot 
complain that they have not had ample opportunity to do so. Nawaz Sharif 
and Benazir Bhutto had the chance to do something about it when the former 
was in power. But at that time Ms Bhutto thought it the greater virtue to 
throw tantalising feelers to Nawaz Sharif in public while flirting with 
President Ishaq behind the scenes. When she returned to power she could 
have made Nawaz Sharif an offer for the repeal of the Eighth Amendment. But 
she had other priorities then and let the moment pass. In the event, it was 
Nawaz Sharif, himself a victim of the Eighth Amendment in the past, who 
publicly started urging President Leghari to use article 58-2(b)  the real 
sting in the amendment  to get rid of Benazir Bhutto.

The record as it stands today is that both of Pakistans leading democratic 
champions have welcomed this article when it has been used on their 
opposite numbers but have invoked the heavens and the Supreme Court when 
its edge has fallen on their own necks. In a land dedicated to the pursuit 
of double standards, there is no more glaring an example of daylight 
hypocrisy than this.

In truth the Eighth Amendment is the most effective protection that 
Pakistan has ever had against martial law. Remove it and prime ministers 
here will be fighting not with presidents as at present but after every two 
or three years coming into direct conflict with the army. It is a 
completely false notion that the presence of the Eighth Amendment has 
cramped the style of our political masters. Had their competence been any 
greater, or their greed any less, there is no reason why after the death of 
General Zia they should not have expanded the frontiers of democracy.

After all, other countries (Spain and Portugal coming instantly to mind) 
have had to contend with far more crippling dictatorial legacies but which, 
because of the skill of their political leaderships, have managed not only 
to exercise the demons of the past but also to lay the foundations of 
secure democratic polities. But in Pakistan the leading contenders, while 
doing everything they can to bring democracy a bad name when they are in 
power, become the greatest champions of democracy and the most fervent 
advocates of judicial activism when, as a result of their own actions they 
are thrown out of power.

Far from forging a consensus to do away with the Eighth Amendment, both the 
PPP and the PML-N should thank their stars that a dictators sense of 
expediency gave them a protective wall behind which to play out their 
shenanigans. Without it Pakistani democracy, moth-eaten as it is, would 
have been hard put to survive the sustained loot and plunder of the last 
eight years.

<a name="thel">The lure of English</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafizur Rahman

IN the years following partition there was a war of words in East Punjab 
whether Hindi should be the language of that province or Punjabi written in 
the Gurmukhi script. Tempers ran high on both sides.
    
Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru once made a caustic comment on this 
linguistic quarrel. He said, Funnily enough, the battle between Hindi and 
Punjabi is being fought in Urdu. At that time all but a few daily papers 
in Indian Punjab were still being published in Urdu.
    
Something of the same kind is constantly going on in our midst too. The 
respective merits of Urdu and English as medium of instruction and as 
official language are being hotly disputed all over the country. But the 
most passionate votaries of Urdu choose to express their preference for 
that language in English newspapers. One wonders whether they are able to 
write equally well in Urdu also.
    
Since I too am writing on this sensitive subject in an English newspaper, 
you wont find me committing myself to any side, for or against. Im too 
clever for that. But write on the subject I must, otherwise I shall be the 
only semi-educated person in Pakistan who has not expressed his views on 
the language issue.
    
Seriously speaking, we are going through a national trauma in this regard. 
This realisation that ones own language should be the national language is 
very much there. But the habit of English is too old and too deep to be 
shed without a fight.
    
There is also the complex that Urdu stands for a desi and slightly backward 
culture, while English denotes modernity and enlightenment and higher 
education. The intelligentsia and the elites take pride in reading, writing 
and speaking English. Even the uneducated, in fact the illiterate too, like 
to be seen using common English words as a matter of prestige.
    
The desire to show off in English when no English is there to show off, is 
a very old phenomenon in the subcontinent. I am reminded of the well-known 
Hakim Abdul Latif of Aligarh. Completely devoid of English himself, he 
would make it a point to use English words while giving directions to his 
usually unlettered patients. Barley water pia karo, mian, barley water. 
Kya samjhe? Are bhai, jau ka pani. Yaar, bilkul hi jaahil ho. I do not now 
recall if the patients were impressed or not.
    
And then there was the West Pakistan minister in the One Unit days, who, as 
Lahoris are fond of saying, was quite pedestrian in English and educated 
upto Shahdara only. But he would spout English expressions in profusion  
his own version of them sometimes. For instance, when asked to state what 
his department had decided about a certain new project, he replied that 
there was no hurry; Graduately karenge.
    
I have myself seen him dictate a D.O. letter to a cabinet colleague. He 
called his P.A. and started speaking. The letter opened with the English 
words My dear Malik Sahib, and then he dictated the entire letter in 
Punjabi, concluding again in English with Yours sincerely. Hurry up. Of 
course the last two words were addressed to the P.A. who was expected to 
come back jaldi with a correct fair draft in English for the minister to 
sign.
    
It never occurred to old Chaudhry Sahib that there was no harm if he didnt 
know English as long as he had been elected by the people to represent 
them, and as long as he was a fairly good minister, which he was. It is a 
different matter that later he was proceeded against for corrupt practices, 
but that was only a professional hazard.
    
No government officer worth his salt would like to be found deficient in 
qualities that go to make the conventional officer. One of them is the 
ability to give dictation to the P.A. in clear, fluent and correct English. 
An old PCS hand, who managed to become the provincial Home Secretary of 
West Pakistan just before retirement, rather than fumble for words would 
write out the letter on a piece of paper. He would then hold the paper 
under the table and read it out slowly to the P.A. as if he was dictating 
from memory.
    
He happened to get a new P.A. who was not only blunt but also impish by 
temperament. The P.A. had got on to the Secretarys stratagem. He bore with 
him for a week or so, but then he could no longer resist the temptation to 
show off his cleverness. One day he calmly asked the boss to hand over the 
paper to him so that he could copy the text from it. Itll be easier this 
way, sir, he said, tongue in cheek. Imagine the poor Home secretarys 
discomfiture!
    
Talking of P.A.s, there is a characteristic common to all of them. If they 
are in doubt about an English word which they have taken down in shorthand 
they will never go back to the boss and ask him about it. That would be 
infra dig. They will try their damnedest to decipher it, and even rummaging 
through the dictionary.
    
A typical story of old which I often narrate is about my own man. I had 
ended a rather personal letter with the words Good luck to you. He took 
an unusually long time over typing out the letter, and I found later that 
he had been consulting both his colleagues and the dictionary. Eventually 
when he came to me with the fair draft, the words typed by him were, Good 
lunch to you!
    
In the situation we have in Pakistan today, Urdu is certainly suffering 
from disuse, while poor English, much maligned in the debate about the 
national and official language, is the victim of flagrant misuse. I suppose 
it will go on like this, and one day well have to have a SPCE (Society for 
the Prevention of Cruelty to English), if, by that time, somebody knows the 
spelling of these words.
    
I have carefully read this piece twice over and find that I have not 
betrayed, by anything that I have said, my own preference for either urdu 
or English. Thats good!

<a name="dutc">Dutch lift Champions Trophy, beating Pakistan 3-2</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
S. Thyagarajan

MADRAS, Dec 15: The Netherlands completed the Olymplc year in a blaze of 
glory, winning their third major tournament with a 3-2 victory over 
Pakistan in the final of the Champions Trophy hockey competition in Madras.

Earlier, Germany overwhelmed India 5-0 to take the bronze medal. Spain 
prevailed 5-2 against Australia to take fifth place in the six- nation 
competition.

The Dutch, who at the start of the year won the qualifying event for the 
Olympics at Barcelona, then achieved the dream of winning their first gold 
medal at Atlanta. On Sunday they added the Champions Trophy after a gap of 
14 years since a win in Amsterdam in l982.

I am extremely happy. This team has to be developed for the 1998 World 
Cup. Our game plan was to attack and score as many goals as possible. In 
the second half, only one team was controlling the game, and that was the 
Netherlands. That showed the confidence of my boys, said Roelant Oltmands.

Defending champions Germany breezed to bronze with a comfortable 5-0 
against India. The highlight of the match was a hat-trick by Christoph 
Bechmann.

Olympic silver medalists Spain beat Australia 5-2 in driving rain, playing 
with confidence from the push-off and dominating the exchanges.

<a name="neth">Netherlands establish supremacy in hockey</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
S. Thyagarajan

MADRAS, Dec 16: Treated as a test for reconstructed squads, the 18th 
Champions Trophy in Madras established the supremacy of Dutch hockey.
    
For the Netherlands, which regained the five-kilogram silver trophy after a 
gap of 14 years, the Olympic year symbolised the golden age.
    
The third win for the Netherlands  the previous two were in 1981 (Karachi) 
and 1982 (Amsterdam)  was the culmination of a glorious year. They won the 
Olympic qualifier at Barcelona in January, the first gold at Atlanta, and 
the Champions Trophy on Sunday.
    
The first major FIH competition after the abolition of the offside rule 
produced 74 goals, 17 on the last day, in 18 games at an average of 4-l.
    
Reaction to change was mixed. Some feel the Asian countries will benefit in 
the long run.
    
Roelant Oltamans, the Dutch coach, assessed the sequence of triumphs as a 
mirror of the quality and depth of the Dutch, preparing to stage the next 
World Cup at Utrecht in June.
