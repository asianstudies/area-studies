<a name="miss">Missile facility near completion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, June 5: Pakistan is on the verge of completing a modern 
domestic installation capable of producing missiles with a 1000 kg payload 
and a striking distance of 600 km, the US armed forces Newswire Service 
claimed on Wednesday.
    
In a brief report, it said: "Work on the construction of the facility is 
scheduled for completion by August, with Pakistan reportedly having managed 
to obtain sufficient quantities of key solid fuel ingredients."
    
In addition, it claimed, Chinese experts were also working on the guidance 
and control system and on domestic production of solid fuel.
    
The missile is expected to be a close variant of the M-9 type ballistic 
missile already developed by the Chinese.

<a name="indi">India to build aircraft carrier</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai
   
WASHINGTON, June 4: India is to build its own 20,000-ton aircraft carrier 
for its navy in collaboration with Spain after the Russians have refused to 
sell second-hand carrier for less than $ 1.4 billion.
    
Defence sources said here a high level technical team of Spanish experts 
has already visited the Cochin shipyard in India where the new $750 million 
carrier is to be built.
    
The Indians call their new project an 'air defence ship' and it will be 
able to accommodate 20 combat helicopters. Sources said the Indian navy had 
already approved the project and final approval and funding was being 
awaited after the elections and the settling down of the new government in 
New Delhi.
    
The Indian navy's aircraft carrier 'Vikrant' has already been 
decommissioned and is docked at Bombay since November 1994 after its 
excessive corrosion.
    
Their second carrier, 36-year old 'Viraat' is also due for decommissioning 
in the next five years and the authorities have decided that instead of 
spending some $250 million on maintenance of these two old aircraft 
carriers, they should build a new one.
    
Sources said India was planning to buy an 18-year old Kiev- class aircraft 
carrier from Russia to replace its old ships but differences over the cost 
led to a breakdown in negotiations.

<a name="indo">Indonesia to purchase F-16s meant for Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, June 5: The Clinton administration is close to completing a 
deal to deliver 11, and possibly all the 28, Pakistani F-16 combat jets to 
Indonesia and reimburse Pakistan, the Washington Post said.
    
"Indonesias initial purchase will be 11 planes," officials said on 
Tuesday.
    
Defence industry sources told Dawn the deal with Indonesia for all the 28 
planes had been made possible after Pakistan agreed to make substantial 
defence purchases directly from Indonesia, including some old civilian 
planes.
    
Jakarta would also be asking Washington for easy terms of payment for the 
F-16s, if all the 28 were to be purchased, the sources said.
    
"Even if Indonesia eventually decides to buy all 28," a Pakistani 
government spokesman told the Post, "their value has diminished since the 
original purchase and there probably would still be a shortfall of at least 
$150 million."
    
Pakistan agreed to the transaction on the understanding that it still wants 
full reimbursement and expects Washington to make up the difference, the 
spokesman said.
    
The Post quoted administration officials as saying completion of the 
transaction would go a long way toward ending a long-standing dispute 
between Washington and Islamabad, but it is drawing criticism from human 
rights advocates, who oppose military sales to Indonesia because of that 
countrys occupation of East Timor.
    
Pakistan probably will use the proceeds from the sale to Indonesia to buy 
reconditioned Mirage combat planes from France, US officials and diplomatic 
sources said.

<a name="hami">Hamid Gul sees civil war in country</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, June 2: Former ISI chief, Gen Hamid Gul, said on Sunday that 
Pakistan was heading fast towards a civil war and needed "a strong, honest, 
competent and courageous leadership" to check the free fall.
    
In an interview telecast by the International TV Channel 56, in its 
Pakistani programme 'Mehfil, Mehfil', the retired general said weak and 
timid leadership would not be able to steer the country out of the present 
morass.
    
The former ISI chief said if democracy could not provide the fruits that it 
should to the people, it was useless. "You cannot name a cactus as a mango 
tree and claim that it will give you fruit," he remarked.
    
He said what was now prevalent in Pakistan was not democracy. "There is 
practically a situation of apartheid in Pakistan with the Pajero/Paktel 
class trying to enter the 21st century and the poor deprived classes 
sliding back into the 13th century."
    
Gen Gul said people in Pakistan had lost their dignity, and respect for 
humanity was non-existent. "The state is not under threat but the country 
was heading towards a revolution, a civil war, when the people would no 
longer be able to tolerate the injustices."
    
He said Pakistan was fast moving towards becoming another Rwanda or 
Burundi. "I don't understand why the ruling classes think we will not meet 
the same fate when we are committing the same mistakes?"
    
Asked how the situation could be remedied, Gen Gul said cosmetic changes 
would not make any difference. "Let there be a complete reaction and let 
the people rise against this system. They will because political parties 
have become personal fiefdoms and jagirs."

<a name="azfa">Azfar, Dehlavi indicate resumption of talks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, June 2: A breakthrough could take place next week in the context 
of the resumption of stalled talks between the government and the MQM if 
positive signals emanating from the people who matter in Islamabad are to 
be taken seriously.
    
Indications for the resumption of formal talks were given at a joint press 
briefing by the Sindh governor, Kamal Azfar, and the chief MQM negotiator, 
Ajmal Dehlavi, at the end of their over 100- minute exchange of views.
    
During the meeting, which both sides emphasised was informal "talks about 
talks", they had a detailed review of the Karachi problem, including the 
law and order situation, the MQM's boycott of the assembly and other 
political matters.
    
Talking to newsmen at a joint briefing after the talks, the governor urged 
the MQM to resume talks and come to the negotiating table to sort out its 
grievances and make the prevailing calm permanent and effective.
    
Mr Azfar was confident that this time the negotiation would definitely 
succeed.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 4: The Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Pakistan 
Peoples Party on Tuesday said the local bodies election should be held on 
party-basis throughout the country. 
    
Sheikh Rafiq Ahmad while briefing the newsmen after the CEC meeting said 
the party discussed at length the local bodies elections in the country. He 
said the party is of the considered opinion that local bodies elections 
should be held on party-basis throughout the country.
    
Asked about the reported opposition by PML (J) to this proposal, Sheikh 
Rafiq Ahmad said the party would try to convince the PML (J) leadership to 
hold elections on party-basis.
    
He said local bodies elections in the remaining three provinces would be 
held on party-basis. We want that they should also be held on party basis 
in Punjab.
    
Sheikh Rafiq Ahmad said the local bodies elections would be held before the 
end of 1996.

<a name="10%n">10% NFC pool for backward regions</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, June 2: In a last-minute attempt to formulate a consensus 
National Finance Commission Award, the federal government has proposed 
distribution of 10 per cent of the provincial share of revenues from the 
divisible pool on the basis of need and the rest on population principle.
    
Under the formula, the need of a province/area has been proposed to be 
estimated against the scale of national averages of socio-economic 
indicators.  Provinces / areas with below national average socio-economic 
indicators will receive a lumpsum reflecting the difference between the 
national socio-economic indicator averages and the averages of that 
particular province/area for the same.
    
Thus the federally administered tribal areas (FATA), Northern Areas and 
Balochistan are likely to get the lion's share from the provincial pool's 
10 per cent allocated for distribution on need basis.
    
The Punjab, which would lose the most from this formula, is expected to be 
asked to accept it as a trade-off for having obtained an indefinite 
postponement of census.   
    
If the house census which has been completed, is taken as an indicator, a 
fresh census would have in any case shown that since 1981 the populations 
of Sindh and NWFP together have gone up by not such an insignificant extent 
while that of the Punjab had declined pro rata.
    
A consensus Award has not been evolved so far because, the three smaller 
provinces would like revenue collection, development level, resource 
generation efforts and population control endeavours to be included among 
the distribution criteria.
    
In the 1991 NFC Award, the biggest beneficiary was Punjab while the NWFP 
had gained the least.
    
This anomaly was a consequence of the lack of innovation in the revenue 
sharing formula and the exclusion of important considerations like 
backwardness, urbanisation and land area, etc.

<a name="isla">Islamabad, Manila fabricated case: Ramzi</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider 

NEW YORK, May 31: Ramzi Ahmed Youseff, the main defendant in the terror 
trial, spurned the advice of the federal court judge, Kevin Duffy, and said 
here on Thursday that he was being tortured in a Pakistani jail at the time 
when the US authorities put him in Manila, Philippine, planning to launch 
an international campaign of terror.
    
After Judge Duffy reluctantly allowed him to waive his right to a lawyer, 
Ramzi Ahmed Youseff, said the case against him was based on evidence 
fabricated by Pakistani and Philippines authorities who were trying to 
please the United States government.
    
Youseff is charged by the US prosecutors for planning to launch an 
"international campaign of terror" from Philippine, by blowing up 11 US 
jumbo jet airliners, en route to destinations is South Asia, in which as 
many as 4,000 people could have been killed.
    
Youseff, who was coherent and eloquent in his defence contended that he 
could not have planted the bomb that exploded on the Philippine airliner on 
Dec 11, 1994, in what the US prosecutors say was a rehearsal for a much 
broader plan, because he was being held by the Pakistani military police 
from late November 1994 until Feb 8, 1995. That was the time he was turned 
over to the US federal agents for extradition to the United States.
    
He said that the evidence would show that he was tortured during that 
period of time, he was deprived of food. He was shackled in a very painful 
way. He maintained that his blood had stained some objects in Pakistani 
jail which would be shown to the jury as evidence.
    
Speaking in third person while turning towards the jury at the trial which 
opened here on Wednesday said that during the course of the trial "you will 
learn that defendant Youseff was a victim of two governments that wanted to 
please the United States and showing that they were making favour for the 
United States by building this case and fabricating most of the evidence."
    
"So I would like also to ask you to ignore whatever you hear from the media 
about the defendant Youseff, and I would also ask you to ignore all the 
spectators in this courtroom and just to concentrate on the evidence. And 
if you do so, I believe that the only just verdict which you would find 
after the end of this trial is 'not guilty'."
    
However, Youseff did not explain on Thursday as to why the Pakistani 
authorities wanted him locked up. He is also to account for his whereabouts 
during the World Trade Center bombing for which he faces another trial.

<a name="arre">Arrears exceeding Rs1000 : Consumers face power cut</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim-ur-Rehman

KARACHI, May 31: The KESC has decided to disconnect connections under a 
recovery drive to overcome the liquidity crunch.
    
The field staff of the KESC has been instructed to snap connection of 
consumers whose arrears exceed than Rs 1000.00 irrespective of the due date 
mentioned on the bill, said a spokesman of the KESC on Friday.
    
Admitting paucity of funds, the spokesman said the KESC was in urgent need 
of funds to carry out its development projects to overcome the problem of 
frequent breakdowns in their areas.
    
While mentioning paucity of fund as one of the reason for the recovery 
drive for financing development projects, the spokesman in another 
statement said "sufficient funds and material is available" for 
reinforcements of PMTs, laying of additional cables and feeders etc. under 
the 11 kV rehabilitation programme.
    
The electricity company did not explain where all the funds already 
procured and released for the distribution system improvement had gone 
especially when about 80 per cent of the work had not been carried out as 
yet.
    
The spokesman claimed that final disconnection notices had already been 
sent to all defaulters and added that advertisements, which should be 
treated as final notice, are also being published in local newspapers on 
Saturday for information of defaulters, who might not have received 
notices.
    
Inquiries revealed that about 80 per cent of the KESC's over 1.3 million 
consumers had not received the bills. Many of the lucky ones, who have 
arranged for courier service, received the bill on Thursday afternoon after 
banking hours, in may cases just a day before the due date.
    
Many of the KESC consumers complained that they have been receiving 
inflated bills which were not being rectified while others said they 
received disconnection notices even when they had paid the outstanding 
dues.
    
The general consensus was that a majority of the KESC consumers had become 
defaulter because the billing department had not properly fed the required 
data into the computer.

<a name="piao">PIA offloads student in New York</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, May 30: As summer holidays approach, the PIA overbooks to 
maximise its payload, and then offloads the passengers, telling them it was 
the fault of their travel agents who did not confirm their seats before 
issuing the ticket.
    
In most cases PIA officials allegedly misrepresent the facts. This happened 
in one particular case, which is microcosm of the norm existing at the 
airlines airport counter. Adnan Ahmed, a student returning to Karachi for 
summer holidays, like several hundreds of his counterparts, was offloaded 
and the PIA staff told him he had a request seat. They promised him a seat 
on the next available flight. However, Adnan was offloaded again last 
Friday and asked to stay in the airport lobby for another day. He was 
eventually put on a flight on Saturday.
    
When the PIA staff at the airport was asked about his whereabouts by his 
family members here, they were simply told: He was a No-show on the 
Thursday flight. We do not know where he is.
    
When General Manager Salim Jehangir was asked to comment on the incident, 
he said these things happen every day. 
   
He put the blame on Pakistani travel agents who he said issued tickets with 
OK stickers without confirming the seats.
    
When he was informed that in this particular case, after being offloaded 
the PIA offered Adnan hotel room, but told his relatives they had no idea 
about his whereabouts, insisting that he was a No-show in writing, Mr. 
Jehangir said: "I will have to look into this particular case."
    
He accused all travel agents in the United States of having ruined the 
image of the national carrier by overbooking.
    
He, however, conceded that similar incidents had happened in the past 
wherein police had to be called in to stop the passengers from physically 
manhandling the staff. 
   
"Hundreds of people were issued confirmed seats by these unscrupulous 
agents last year during the peak season and the PIA had to take the brunt 
of the whole mess."

<a name="neig">Neighbourhood group makes PECHS area cleaner, safer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar R. Quraishi

KARACHI, May 31: Government inaction and the inefficiency of the city's 
civic agencies have caused many city neighbourhoods to degenerate. However, 
some people decided that they would stand by the wayside and silently watch 
the rot. Partially successful in their efforts, they have now been 
approached by residents of other areas to expand this community action.
    
A neighbourhood group of residents in PECHS's Block 6 has stepped in where 
the government and its civic agencies seem to have abdicated their 
responsibilities.
    
The Neighbourhood Care-Citizen's Police Liaison Committee (CPLC) project 
has done what other Karachiites can only wish for: a secure, safe and a 
well-lit neighbourhood; streets that are cleaned regularly and have no open 
manholes; garbage and trash that is picked up and disposed off properly and 
not thrown indiscriminately outside anyone's house; no overflowing smelly 
gutters polluting the area; and a local park that is properly looked after.
    
Started in March 1995, Neighbourhood Care (NC) runs on the material and 
financial donations of local residents. 
   
Close to 80 people give between Rs 1500 to Rs 3000 every month to the NC, a 
few have contributed larger sums for a 'capital fund' which is used is set 
aside for larger projects or contingencies.
    
The area the NC tries to look after stretches from the Nursery market in 
the south to just before Hill Park in the north, and from where Block 6 
starts near Tariq Road to where Sharea Faisal runs.
    
The NC has an office on Hamid Hussain Road (36/M, Block 6), open 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week, and manned by supervisors working in three shifts.
    
Danial Mehmud is an NC volunteer who spends an hour every morning at the 
office, before he goes to work. He told this reporter that several people 
in neighbourhoods adjacent to Block 6  Rohelkhand Society, Block 2, the 
Hill Park area, the rest of Block 6 on the other side of Sharea Faisal  
were interested in copying the NC programme in their areas.
    
"Many of them have even come to the NC office and seemed quite determined 
to do something on the lines the NC is doing in Block," Mr Mehmud said.
    
Next to the office is a large plot which used to be a rubbish dump but was 
actually meant for a park. The NC lobbied the KMC to help to clear the 
place and convert the plot for its intended use.
    
A visit to the site on Friday by this reporter showed that conversion work 
was well underway. NC's co-ordinator Sami Nustafa told Dawn that this 
refurbishment would cost around Rs 800,000 and the money had been raised by 
an NC member and an anonymous donor.
    
To provide security in the neighbourhood, the NC first bought a Suzuki 
Khyber and two motorcycles. The car, used for patrolling the neighbourhood, 
has a donated mobile phone (out of use these days because of the 
prohibition on mobile phones) and a wireless system connected with the 
office.
    
The CPLC helped facilitate the permanent assignment of twelve policemen to 
the NC by the inspector-general of the Sindh police. They work in two 
shifts and get a salary from the group in addition to the one they get from 
the Sindh government. 
   
The patrol car is on call 24 hours a day and a number " 4528888 " is 
advertised throughout the neighbourhood for this purpose.
    
Ms Farah, one of three NC office managers told this reporter that the 
office occasionally gets calls from residents who want the patrol car to 
drive by their house because they think a stranger is around.
    
"Recently, though our office has come in handy for a different reason. 
There are a lot of schools in this area. We have got calls several times 
from female drivers who are on their way to these schools to pick up their 
children, and suspect that some shady people are following their car. These 
women have come to our office and we send our patrol car to escort them to 
their home. The last incident of this kind happened three or four weeks 
ago," she said.
    
The NC also believes that better lit streets are a deterrent against crime. 
Since April 1995, it has spent Rs 75,000 on replacing and repairing street 
lights and lighting up previously unlit lanes.
    
The NC has managed to procure six sweepers courtesy the KMC health 
department, and they are assigned with them permanently. They are 
responsible for picking up the garbage and trash in the neighbourhood. A 
Suzuki pickup was bought for this purpose in August 1995.
    
All houses within the NC's coverage area  it doesn't matter whether they 
are members or not  get thirty plastic bags every month in which they are 
told to put their trash. The pickup goes around six days a week collecting 
the trash-bags and takes them to large waste-collection bins provided by 
the KMC. The NC van is also made available for a fee to members who want to 
use it for disposing garden or plant waste or other cartage purposes.
    
Since December 1995 the NC has also spent about Rs 95,000 on paying a 
private contractor to fix collapsed manholes and damaged water and sewage 
lines. It also successfully asked the KWSB to give 65 manhole covers for 
the neighbourhood. These were provided at no charge.
    
Although the NC thinks that electricity breakdowns are too big and 
widespread a problem for it to tackle, it did manage to get the KESC " with 
much help from the CPLC " to install what are called pole-mounted 
transformers (PMTs) ; these reduce voltage fluctuations. The first PMT 
began working in November, two more will be installed.
    
Neighbourhood Care every month spends Rs 125,900 on its programme.

<a name="visa">Visa rules to be simplified for foreign investors</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, May 31: The government is seriously considering a proposal to 
simplify visa rules for foreign investors and executives of multinational 
corporations visiting Pakistan in connection with investment activities.
    
The proposal envisages that foreign 'investors' and 'expatriate employees' 
from major investing countries like USA, Canada, UK, Germany, Japan, Korea 
and Malaysia, and their families should be granted multiple entry visa for 
the period they need to stay in Pakistan for purposes of investment or for 
a period of three years.
    
It has also been proposed to exempt foreign investors and expatriate 
employees from the above mentioned countries from police registration and 
resident permits requirements. For identification purposes company's 
appointment letters authenticated by the Board of Investment (BoI) is 
proposed to be taken as proof.
    
It has also been proposed that foreign investors and expatriate employees 
from the seven countries mentioned above, who have to often travel on short 
notices will be exempted from obtaining exit permits from the police.
    
And finally it has been proposed that foreign investors and expatriate 
employees coming to Pakistan on business visa from countries mentioned 
above, who subsequently get employment in Pakistan, may be allowed on 
furnishing the proof of employment, conversion of their visa to work visa 
so that they may continue to work here.
    
For investors and expatriate employees from other than the seven countries 
mentioned, problems arising may be sorted out on case by case basis by the 
interior division but not later than 15 days after referral of the case.

<a name="meas">Measures yielding Rs18bn tax finalised</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, June 4: The four-member special committee constituted in 
February, 1996, under the commerce minister to examine the tax regime and 
its system of collection has submitted a 17-point strategy to the 
government, the implementation of which is estimated to generate additional 
revenues amounting to Rs18 billion.
    
The committee has recommended allocation of Rs100 million in 1996-97 budget 
for undertaking nation-wide survey, data-entry of survey information, 
printing of income tax stamps and provision of necessary infrastructure 
for monitoring the flat tax regime.
    
The committee proposes that all incomes including agricultural income may 
be subjected to income tax; all persons, irrespective of the amount of 
their income, may be made liable to income tax and; non-corporate taxpayers 
earning their incomes from business, profession and vocations conducted 
through shops and small manufacturing units (other than those opting out of 
the system or specifically excluded) may be taxed at flat rates. There may 
be no requirements for filing of income tax returns.

<a name="pmok">PM okays proposal for trade with India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, June 5: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has finally approved a 
proposal for the opening of formal trade with India ruling out the 
possibility of any political repercussion as a consequence.
    
I have submitted a report to the prime minister and she has advised me to 
go ahead with the opening of formal trade with India, said the Minister 
for Commerce Chauhdry Ahmad Mukhtar.
    
She has told me that the officials of the commerce ministry should only be 
concerned about the economic repercussions of initiating trade with India 
and should forget about any political repercussion, Ahmad Mukhtar said 
quoting further Ms. Bhutto as having said that Pakistans political 
interests would not be compromised over the issue.
    
However, Pakistans High Commissioner in New Delhi is said to have opposed 
the opening of formal trade with India but without offering any plausible 
explanation. Few weeks ago some of the officials of the security agencies 
were called in the Ministry of Commerce to air their views whether trade 
with India would cause any political and economic harm to Pakistan.
    
However, they too reportedly could not convince the officials over the 
issue except repeating that the people of Pakistan would not endorse the 
idea. It was in that backdrop the officials of the ministry of commerce 
specially the commerce minister and commerce secretary favoured formal 
trade with India. They have decided to favour trade with India after having 
met the representatives of Pakistan Federation of Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry and many other business leaders of Pakistan.
    
The commerce minister further stated that Pakistan would have an advantage 
to start trade with India and that it was wrong to presume that Pakistan 
will be a looser in the game.
    
Mr. Chander Ram, who was earlier the minister of commerce and now the 
minister of finance of India has assured me that India would certainly 
consider Pakistans demand to offer special incentives on import tariffs, 
Ahmad Mukhtar said.
    
We have received a positive response from India to have both way trade 
which I am sure will also lessen political tension between the two 
countries, he believed.
    
He said currently India was ready to start trade through Bombay and Karachi 
but, we are sure they would also accept to have this trade from other 
channels as well.

<a name="repo">Report sought on rise in landing charges</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

LAHORE, June 5: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Wednesday cited the 
enormous increase by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in landing charges 
for aircraft as a major disincentive for foreign investors to come to 
Pakistan and directed the authorities concerned to submit to the government 
a set of recommendations within two months to solve this problem.
    
The prime ministers remarks came after she had performed the ground-
breaking ceremony of Lahore airports new $220 million passenger terminal 
complex which is scheduled to be completed in 30 months.
    
Ms Bhutto said it was painful for her to hear that the number of foreign 
flights coming to Pakistan had gone down because of a substantial increase 
in landing charges.
    
This is very bad, a disincentive for foreign investors. The policy of the 
CAA is based on narrow-mindedness.
    
The Prime Minister was given a briefing by Defence Secretary Salim Abbas 
Jilani and the CAA director general about the salient features of the 
project after which she started asking questions.

When she was told that the project would be completed by December 1998, she 
said in a lighter vein that it should be made operational in August of that 
year, when the constitutional term of the present government would be 
coming to an end.
    
Defence Secretary Salim Abbas Jilani, in his address of welcome, said the 
new terminal building would be equipped with all modern facilities. The 
existing building, he admitted, did not have enough facilities for 
passengers and at time it caused a lot of inconvenience to air travellers.

According to him the CAA had now acquired a radar system which had a wider 
coverage.
    
CAA Director-General Khalil Ahmed, in his briefing to the prime minister, 
said the existing terminal building at the Lahore airport was insufficient 
to take the increasing load of passengers. The new terminal building would 
be able to handle six million passengers a year and the capacity could be 
doubled as and when required. The new terminal has been designed by NESPAK.
    
The terminal will have the capacity to have seven planes on one side and 13 
on the other with a parking facility for 800 vehicles.
    
The economic rate of return of the project would be 18.5 per cent and 
Lahore would get benefits worth Rs33 billion over a period of 20 years. 
About 3,000 people would work on the project to complete it.

<a name="nbpm">NBP may launch Rs 1bn bond</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, June 2: After floating a $75 million commercial paper in the US in 
April, National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) plans to launch a Rs 1.0 billion 
rupee-denominated debt instrument in Pakistan.
    
A source close to NBP say the proposed instrument  possibly a term finance 
certificate (TFC) of three years maturity  may offer an annual return of 
more than 15 per cent. Three-year Federal Investment Bonds (FIBs) offer 13 
per cent.
    
"The proposed debt-instrument may be a bond or a TFC," said the source. He 
said in either case the instrument would be of 3-year maturity and traded 
across the country through NBP branch network. He said the return would be 
paid by way of six-monthly coupons in case the proposed instrument is a 
bond.
    
Overseas Pakistanis and foreigners would also be able to purchase the NBP 
debt-instrument  going to be the first one of their kind launched by any 
Pakistani bank. These are likely to be offered in Rs 5,000 and Rs 100,000 
denominations for individual and corporate buyers respectively.

<a name="cheq">Cheque bouncing to become punishable act</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, June 1: The government plans to introduce a budgetary measure from 
July next, which will make all business transactions of Rs 0.1 million and 
above , compulsorily cheque based, in a bid to move ahead on path of 
documentation of the national economy.
    
Senior bankers and economists, consulted by budget makers in Islamabad 
recently, hinted at the possibility of 1996-97 budget incorporating a 
measure which would forbid cash transactions of Rs 0.1 million and above.
    
For this purpose, the government is framing a law to make bouncing of bank 
cheques a punishable offence either by way of fine which could be double 
the amount of cheque which could not be encashed or in default a maximum 
imprisonment of one year.
    
Draft of the proposed law, which seeks to amend the Negotiable Instrument 
Act, 1881, has been finalised after years- long exercise in which the 
finance and law ministries and legal departments of the State Bank of 
Pakistan and Pakistan Banking Council and nationalised commercial banks 
were involved.
    
Likely to be tabled in the form of a Bill in one of the next sessions of 
the National Assembly, the proposed law stipulates that if the amount of 
cheque is not honoured within 30 days of the receipt of information of non-
payment of the cheque to the person in whose favour it is drawn, the person 
who has drawn the cheque will be liable for punishment.
    
It lays down three specific conditions which can make the drawer of the 
cheque liable for punishment. The first condition is that when a person 
draws a cheque knowingly that such a cheque will not be honoured. In the 
second condition, when there is no or insufficient funds in the account on 
which a cheque is drawn, and the third condition is when a cheque is drawn 
on an account which is not in the name of the drawer.
    
The law holds director, partner or employee of a company, a corporation, a 
firm or an institution equally responsible for the offence if it is 
established that such a cheque which has been eventually dishonoured by a 
bank has been issued with his knowledge.
    
Bankers expect the bill to be adopted as law by the National Assembly in 
the near future as they consider it linked with the budgetary measures for 
the next fiscal year.

<a name="rs12">Rs12 billion being spent on uplift schemes in the city</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 1: The Sindh government is taking up 112 development schemes 
in Karachi at a total cost of Rs 12.46 billion, Syed Asad Ali Shah, Advisor 
to Chief Minister on Finance and Development announced.
    
Speaking at a Press conference in which he gave an overview of Sindhs 
finances and development during 1995-96, as first of the series of such 
Press briefings planned for next 12 days every day by the Provincial 
Information Department, the Advisor said Karachi development programme 
includes 55 water supply schemes, 24 sewerage and 17 communication schemes 
in addition to the schemes for storm water drains, solid waste management, 
fire fighting equipment, recreational development which, according to him, 
are at different stages of execution.

In context of water supply to Karachi, he said another scheme of augmenting 
water supply by 42 million gallons a day will be completed by December, 
1996, while work on project to further increase the supply by 54 MGD is in 
full swing. Yet another mega-project to increase water supply by 100 MGD is 
being taken up with foreign assistance for which Rs 720 million has been 
provided from local sources.
    
Despite these schemes, Syed Asad Ali Shah said, Karachi will continue to 
suffer water shortage as by the time these projects are completed, the 
demand for water increases. At present, he said, there is a gap of 200 
million gallons between supply and demand in the city.
    
Giving an overview of 1995-96 development effort in Sindh, the Advisor said 
a gigantic outlay of Rs 15.5 billion was involved. It included Rs 7 billion 
ADP, Rs 3.5 billion Tameer-i-Sindh programme and the foreign-aided 
programme was raised to Rs 5 billion from original Rs 3.5 billion.
    
He said that bulk of the Rs 3.5 billion Tameer-e-Sindh programme was for 
Karachi amounting to Rs 1.6 billion while the remaining amount is being 
invested in all parts of the province.

<a name="acti">Active foreign support sends KSE index up by 26.24</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, May 30: Leading shares came in for strong short-covering aided by 
active foreign and institutional support, pushing the index by over 26 
points.
    
There was a virtual scramble for the blue chips at the current levels on 
predictions that the market might witness heavy pre-budget speculative 
buying in some pivotals as foreign investors are after them to make up 
portfolio shortfall.

The KSE index rose by another 26.24 points at 1,737.25, putting it back in 
a relatively safer area as compared to 1,711.01 a day earlier. Fears were 
allayed that it could again breach the barrier of 1,700 points by the end 
of current week.
    
Volume was massive around 50m shares, sending signals in the bear quarters 
that the market was back on the rails.
    
Analysts, however, doubted the markets ability to sustain any snap pre-
budget rally as uncertainties associated with the budget could work against 
the sentiment.
    
They said speculative buying might figure prominently on selected counters 
but it was uncertain that it could sustain the run-up in the sessions 
preceding the budget.
    
The market advance was led by the energy sector where all the blue chips 
recovered smartly on pre-budget buying on predictions of increase in the 
petroleum prices in the new budget.
    
PSO added another Rs 20 to last two sessions gains of Rs 17, which pushed 
well above its chart point of Rs 402. The interesting feature was that 
54,300 shares changed hands at this higher levels.
    
Other energy shares, which rose appreciably were led by Ideal Energy, Hub-
Power, and Shell Pakistan including its right share, which spurted by Rs 8.
    
Some of the MNCs in the chemical and pharma sectors also attracted good 
support and ended with smart rallies under the lead of Searle Pakistan, 
Fauji Fertiliser, Dawood Hercules and Engro Chemicals, rising by one rupee 
to Rs 5.
    
Other leading shares, which showed good gains were led by 24th ICP, which 
rose by Rs 24 followed by 6th ICP, ICP SEMF, MCB and KASB & Co, rising one 
rupee to Rs 2.10.
    
Some of the textiles shares also came in for active short-covering at the 
lower rates and rose under the lead of Apex Fabrics, and Friends Spinning.
    
SK&F led the list of most actives, off Rs 8 followed by Pakistan Refinery, 
Mari Gas, Lever Brothers, Brooke Bond, ICI Pakistan and Knoll Pharma, 
falling by one rupee to Rs 2.
    
Despite a higher divided by the Central Insurance, insurance shares 
attracted weekend selling and finished lower under the lead of EFU, IGI and 
some others.
    
A cash dividend at the rate of 50 per cent from the Central Insurance and 
an interim dividend of five per cent from the directors of Olympia Spinning 
were well-received in the rings. But the interim from the Olympia Spinning 
presented a pleasant surprise to many brokers.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up Rs 1.35 on 19.300m, 
shares, Hub-Power, higher one rupee on 18.320m, Dewan Salman, firm one 
rupee on 1.160m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, steady 10 paisa on 0.663m shares, 
Lucky Cement, lower five paisa on 0.449m, MCB, up Rs 2.10 on 0.329m, Faysal 
Bank, firm 35 paisa on 0.247m and Dhan Fibre, unchanged on 0.274m shares.
    
Trading volume rose to 49.440m shares from the previous 34.671m shares 
thanks to massive activities in PTC and Hub-Power.
    
There were 352 actives, out of which 155 shares suffered fall, while 119 
rose, with 78 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="ksei">KSE index recovers 27 points amid massive buying</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, June 5: The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100 shares staged a 
broad rally, recovering 27 points amid massive buying in some of the 
leading base shares, notably PSO and Shell Pakistan.
    
But analysts said the rally could be deceptive as it was not backed by the 
broader market and could falter half way any time as the required follow-up 
support to sustain it is not there.
    
A big rise of Rs 26 in PSO after the news of its sale promotion deal with 
Coca Cola appears to be the chief inspiring factor behind the snap rally, 
said a leading dealer.
    
What was more important was that the price flare-up in PSO, which is said 
to be the largest in a single session in any 10-rupee share in the recent 
past was not speculative as it was matched by a big volume of over 0.100m 
shares, they said adding which means the rise is genuine and not 
speculative, he added.
    
The notable feature is that it just followed the PSO-Coca Cola deal and 
reflected foreign buying for good reasons, analysts said.
    
The PSO in early 1994 boom had touched the high mark of Rs 450 owing to 
massive increase in its sales to Rs 62bn from Rs 42bn but during the 1995 
stock market slump it had touched the low level of Rs 275 before recovering 
to the current highs.
    
The market sentiment was influenced favourably after the advent of strong 
speculative buying in PTC vouchers, which again broke the Rs 40 barrier and 
was last quoted around Rs 42.40 on a massive volume of 25 million shares.
    
Without PTC, the performance of the market is lacklustre and that was 
perhaps why the snap rally could be deceptive as it has more than 30 per 
cent weightage in 100-share index owing to its size and the market 
capitalisation, analysts said and so is PSO.
    
Bulk of the support elsewhere remained centred around local blue chips and 
most of the MNCs, notably Shell Pakistan, which maintained its upward drive 
and has risen well over Rs 30 during the last few weeks on news of a 
substantial increase in sales and expectations of higher dividend.
    
Others followed it included Glaxo Lab, Wyeth Lab and BOC Pakistan, which 
also showed good gains. Among the local blue chips, which rose appreciably 
ICP SEMF, National Fibre, Al-Abid Silk, Sui Southern and some others were 
leading.
    
But bank, cement, energy and chemical and pharma sectors as a whole gave 
mixed performance as dealers played on both sides of the fence, although 
their current low levels are attractive enough for any pre-budget 
speculative buying.
    
Some of the leading shares including MNCs, such as Wellcome Pakistan, 
Hoechst Pakistan, Reckitt and Colman, Siemens and Dawood Hercules did fall 
but fractionally, reflecting the selling was motivated for replacement 
buying rather than any other reason.
    
Owing to good dividend from most of the leading companies, insurance shares 
were traded higher and so did synthetic ones on expectations of duty cuts 
on the polyester fibre in the new budget.
    
On the corporate front, the board of directors of Pakistan Guarantee 
Insurance Company have announced a cash dividend at the rate of 5.5 per 
cent for the year ended Dec 31, 1995, while the directors of Crescent 
Spinning have omitted the dividend for the year ended Sept 30, 1995.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up Rs 2.15 on 24.831m 
shares followed by Hub-Power, steady 30 paisa on 5.750m shares, FFC-Jordan 
Fertiliser, firm 45 paisa on 0.911m shares, Dewan Salman, up 25 paisa on

Ardeshir Cowasjee

LETS discard the icing, throw the marzipan to the birds, and get down to 
the fruit cake.
    
Every citizen of this country who can read, write and think, can say 
without any fear of contradiction that it is, and always has been, the 
intent of all our leaders (barring the first), to enforce their will, to 
tailor the constitution and all of the laws of the land and to interpret 
them to suit their own special needs so that they may remain in power for 
ever. During the early years, the leaders did make some sort of effort to 
pretend that they had the interests of the country and its people at heart, 
bogus thought it may have been, but since 1971 even pretence has been 
discarded. Now, it is total blatant glasnost; machinations, schemes and 
scams are publicly, fearlessly and contemptuously aired.
    
The whole wise world knows that whatsoever be the foundation of a 
democratic government, whether it be the Magna Carta, the Declaration of 
Independence, Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite, the Objectives Resolution, or 
whatever, the democratic grundnorm is firmly based on the belief 
expostulated by Jefferson: that all men are created equal and independent, 
that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent and inalienable, 
among which are the preservation of life and liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness.
    
Now to our much-mutilated 1973 Constitution (its original form now 
unrecognisable), to the makers of which and to the intent of these makers 
some fifty references have been made by the drafters of the governments 
review petition filed in the Supreme Court in the Judges Case. Just what 
was the intent of the makers of our Constitution, and just how mangled were 
their minds?
    
Memories are short-lived. In 1972, soon after the worlds first civilian 
martial law administrator became our president he appointed a constitution 
commission headed by Law Minister Mahmud Ali Kasuri, that good lawyer and 
forthright man, to come up with the make or frame a constitution for this 
country. That same year, Kasuri resigned as he was unable to agree with 
Bhuttos idea of democracy and the form of the constitution he wished the 
people to have, with power centralised and personalised, and the federating 
provinces not being granted the autonomy fairly due to them.
    
Our democratic leaders do not take kindly to resignations. Kasuri, still a 
member of the National Assembly, suffered reprisals at the hands of his 
master. He was framed in murder cases in Kasur, and to ensure his liberty, 
Barrister Ijaz Batalvi had to seek bail before arrest. After the exit from 
the commission of Kasuri, the task was redelegated to the masters pliable 
and servile servants. The intent of the constitution was to make the prime 
minister all powerful and keep the president as a non-entity. So, when 
Bhutto, in 1973, decided to step down to become prime minister, he looked 
around for a suitable person to replace him.
    
This true story I relate again to exemplify the working of the then 
democratic thought. Rumours were rife that Bhutto was considering Sir 
Mohammed Shafis daughter, Begum Shahnawaz, a good Punjabi. Was she not 
dead? I asked myself, and turned to her autobiography, Father and Daughter. 
The fly-leaf bears two inscriptions: To Rahim with sincere good wishes Apa 
Jehanara 27 August 1971, and Her brother preferred to give this book to 
his pal Ardeshir Cowasjee, Karachi 20.3.1973. Begum Shahnawaz had asked 
her brother, Iqi Shafi, to deliver the book to Minister Jalaluddin Abdur 
Rahim. He never did. In it read, A new village was built on the Grand 
Trunk Road, about one mile from the Shalamar Gardens and became known as 
Baghbanpura. It was there, in my grandparents house, that I was born on 7 
April 1896.
    
She was not old by Chinese standards, but I phoned Iqi. Is it true that 
your old sister is being seriously considered as a candidate for the 
presidency? True, replied Iqi, absolutely true. Is she up to it? I 
asked. She qualifies, pal, she qualifies. She cant see, she cant hear, 
she can barely talk, and needs assistance to walk. But shes on to a good 
thing, so are we. She will have a special train in which she can tour the 
country and we can tag along with her. So pack your bags, pal. Shes 
confident. She is even furbishing her wardrobe.
    
A few days later, Iqi rang. Unpack, pal, unpack. Jehanaras chances are 
receding. Unfortunately she has regained her hearing, her speech is 
becoming clearer. No go, pal, no go, unpack.
    
It was Fazal Elahi Chaudhary who was finally chosen. He was pliant, and 
delivered without demur what was asked of him. Four hours after the 
Constitution was promulgated on August 14, 1973, guaranteeing to the people 
their fundamental rights, the President was made to put his pen to the 
following Order:
    
The Gazette of Pakistan, Extra, August 15, 1973 Islamabad, the 15th 
August 1973 No.F.24 (1)/73-Pub.- The following Order made by the President 
on the 14th August 1973, is hereby published for general information: 
Order.
    
Whereas Article 280 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of 
Pakistan provides that the Proclamation of Emergency issued on the 23rd day 
of November, 1971, shall be deemed to be a Proclamation of Emergency issued 
under Article 232 thereof:
    
And Whereas clause (2) of Article 233 of the said Constitution provides 
that while a Proclamation of Emergency is in force, the President may, by 
Order, declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such 
of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter 1 of Part II of the 
Constitution as may be specified in the Order, and any proceeding in any 
court which is for the enforcement, or involves the determination of any 
question as to the infringement, of the Rights so specified shall remain 
suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force;
    
And Whereas the aforesaid Proclamation of Emergency is in force;
    
Now, Therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by the said clause (2) 
of Article 233, the President is pleased to declare that the right to move 
any court, including the right to move the Supreme Court, vide clause (3) 
of Article 184, for the enforcement of the Fundamental Rights provided for 
in Articles 10,15,16,17,18,19,23,24,25 and 27 of the Constitution, and all 
proceedings pending in any court which are for the enforcement, or involve 
the determination of any question as to the enforcement, of any of the said 
Rights shall remain suspended for the period during which the said 
Proclamation is in force.
    
Signed: Fazal Elahi Chaudhary President
    
Countersigned under Article 48(3) of the Constitution. Shah Nawaz Khan 
Joint Secretary, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Prime Minister
    
Thus were the people deprived of their freedoms, of their constitutionally 
guaranteed fundamental rights. The very next day, the dissenters and 
opposition leaders were arrested and remained incarcerated until Bhutto 
fell four years later. Did the framer-in-chief not know on the morning of 
the promulgation that he would take back from the people, that same 
afternoon, their inalienable rights given four hours earlier? The intent 
was to befool the people for yet another time, all in the name of the law.
    
Kasuri, still an MNA, was one of the 13 who did not sign the Constitution. 
In 1975, when the Rules of Procedure were suspended and the Fourth 
Constitution Bill concerning the liberty of the individual was rushed 
through, Kasuri and a few others in the opposition opposed it. The Speaker 
ordered that the opposers be physically thrown out of the chamber. This was 
done.
    
It is indeed unfortunate that the leaders of this country consider the 
thinking of the teeming 130 millions-plus (the majority illiterate and a 
very insignificant minority literate) to be as juvenile and delinquent as 
their own. Thanks to them and their cringing selfish sycophantic 
supporters, backwards is the only direction in which we can progress. Soon 
after Jinnah made Pakistan, I remember buying a dollar for Rs. 3.80. The 
other day I bought it for Rs 38.00.
    
This country is being ruled by progressively more and more edicts and 
ordinances. The government does not budget the increased charges for 
utilities. They merely increase, time and time again, the surcharges. The 
prices of bare necessities are increasing by leaps and bounds. The poor and 
oppressed are agitated. The executive cannot afford an independent 
judiciary.
    
The judiciary, on the other hand, supported by the people, has asserted 
itself. Despite the efforts of the executive to create a rift in its ranks, 
it has so far remained united. It owes it to the people to interpret the 
Constitution in keeping with the original universal democratic intent: to 
uphold the inalienable inherent rights of the people, to preserve their 
life and liberty, and to allow them to pursue, as best they may, happiness.

Ayaz Amir

THE strength or the spirit to howl with pain the people of Pakistan lost a 
long time ago. Like children exhausted by crying they have learnt to mute 
their sorrows. Now a revolution is at hand because even this privilege they 
may be on the verge of losing. Twelve more months of Ms Bhutto's macro-
management of the economy and they will be deprived of the strength even to 
whimper with pain.
    
This is what the sustained inflationary onslaught of the last three years 
has done to the proud people of Pakistan: beaten them into a state of 
abject submission and robbed them even of the power of protesting. The 
Black Label / Turbo Cooler classes, whose leaping prosperity has been the 
most conspicuous achievement of the Islamic Republic during the last 
fifteen years, may not be aware of the plight of their less fortunate 
countrymen but those who live on a fixed salary or those families whose 
grown-up sons have been looking for a proper sifarish so that they may get 
a low-paying job have somewhat different experiences to relate. In Mr V.A. 
Jafarey's economic hothouse it is becoming increasingly difficult for such 
people to survive and at the same time keep the last shreds of their 
dignity intact.
    
It has taken the combined wisdom of Ms Bhutto (who is her own finance 
minister), the inevitable Mr V.A. Jafarey, Shahid Hasan Khan (wherever did 
he come from?) and the various secretaries of finance to bring not the 
country (because who cares about the country?) but the hapless people of 
Pakistan to this desperate pass. It is a measure of the economic successes 
of the last three years (this inflationary spiral having been started by 
that answer to Pakistan's dreams, Mr Moeen Qureshi) that a hundred rupee 
note is now treated even by those who have it in their hands like a ten 
rupee note of yore. When the present thousand rupee notes were first 
introduced some years ago they were considered by ordinary people (that is, 
those not belonging to the Black Label classes) to be too big to handle. 
Nowadays one of these notes is no sooner encashed than it begins rapidly to 
disappear. And Mr Jafarey, our answer to Maynard Keynes, says that the 
inflation rate is ten or eleven per cent. If there is a national prize for 
keeping a straight face while saying outrageous things, surely he deserves 
to get it.
    
But what, pray, is the essence of bhuttonomics, that which distinguishes it 
from other momentous economic doctrines? It consists of a paradox: a 
mixture of audacity and stealth. The audacity lies in raising prices  that 
of utilities, furnace oil, petroleum products, etc.  as and when Mr 
Jafarey and his advisers see a vision in their dreams. The stealth lies in 
not announcing these rises. In Ms Bhutto's Republic you can have one set of 
prices when you go to bed at night and an altogether different one by the 
time you are reading your newspapers the next morning.
    
Or take another example. The rupee, that most flexible and gymnastic of 
currencies, has been slipping ever since my generation grew to manhood. 
Under Ms Bhutto's stewardship this slipping has become a precipitous slide. 
But is ever an announcement made of the rupee's devaluation? No, it is just 
allowed to happen  audaciously and stealthily. Just a few days ago the 
dollar was selling at Rs 34/35. Today it is touching 40. But not the 
faintest squeak will anyone have heard from Mr Jafarey or the State Bank. 
Indeed, under Ms Bhutto budget-making has become a redundant exercise. The 
forecasts made in a budget are supposed to have some sanctity. It is a 
tribute to the economic management of the past three years that no one 
takes the budget seriously any more: not the people of Pakistan, not the 
IMF and the World Bank and certainly not those officials directly 
responsible for calculating its phantom sums. In other departments of 
national life the art of make -believe, of living in a world entirely of 
our own invention, has already been taken to lofty heights. Thanks to the 
ministrations of Ms Bhutto's economic wizards, it has now been installed as 
the ruling deity even in the arid fields of finance.
    
If this were all, the people of Pakistan would still not complain. They are 
inured to hardships. They do not expect much from their rulers. They are 
used to the corruption of the administration  of the bribes that they have 
to pay to the patwari and the thanedar. Anyone who has a doubt about the 
patience of the Pakistani people should see one of those queues outside a 
bank when people line up to pay their utility bills. In any other country 
these queues which are replicated across the length and breadth of the land 
would cause a revolutionary upheaval. Or at least they would be the angry 
cause of an assault on the banking system. Here people for whom standing in 
queues is foreign to their nature squat outside banks with the patience of 
the ages.
    
But as I say even these things would not matter if the people of Pakistan 
were left alone in their misery. Why must their intelligence and patience 
be insulted all the time by the constant refrain from on high that the 
economy is being macro- managed and that things were never better for them? 
The non-Black Label classes are finding it difficult to make both ends meet 
and here is the Prime Minister telling them (this clip comes on television 
every other evening) that her Awami Government has given them cellular 
telephones and FM Radio. This is as good a variation on the Marie 
Antoinette theme as any. What if the people do not have bread? Let them 
listen to FM Radio.
    
Who are these surreptitious men anyway who get these fat contracts in the 
Republic? Makhdoom Sahabuddin may know as much of economics as I do but at 
least the people have elected him. Whoever elected Shahid Hasan Khan to 
anything? What is his claim to fame? And who is Javed Pasha? For what 
services to the country has he been given permission, without public notice 
or tender, to open FM Radio, the regime's substitute for bread and 
subsistence? He must also be a defence expert (every Johnny in this country 
being a defence expert) because even Air Marshal Abbas Khattak's Shaheen 
Foundation has teamed up with him to open a cable television service. How 
are these deals cobbled together in the dead of night without the people or 
our sovereign Parliament being any the wiser about them?
    
In any case, is it seemly for the PAF leadership to be spending so much 
energy in running toyshops like Shaheen Air and going into business with 
the likes of Mr Javed Pasha? If hostilities break out, will Air Marshal (or 
is it Air Chief Marshal?) Khattak pit cable television against India's air 
fleet?
    
It is just not Bhuttonomics which is a product of audacity and stealthy. 
Everything in this country gets done the same way because our rulers are 
answerable to no one except their own primitive notions of grandeur, 
parliament is an irrelevant talk shop while the people after calculating 
the effects of inflation are left with no time to think about anything 
else.
    
Consider the PAF's latest marketing coup: its acquisition of 40 Mirage-111s 
from France. These aircraft were commissioned into the French air force in 
1962; into the PAF in 1967. Thirty years later they are no better than 
junk. And we have paid 120 million dollars for them. In aerial warfare, as 
the greenest aviation novice is well aware, bulk does not count, quality 
does. What to talk of 40 Mirage-111s, even 400 of these obsolescent birds 
are of no use to us. And yet this deal which would not have gone through in 
any other country of the world except perhaps Mobutu's Zaire is being 
presented as some kind of a master-stroke by our Flying Barons. Is there 
never going to be any accountability in our Republic? And will defence 
purchases forever remain outside the ambit of public scrutiny?

Benazir Bhutto

TODAY, on the eve of World Environment Day, my thoughts return to my 
childhood. I recall walking on the sands of Clifton Beach, watching 
fishermen bring in the days catch, picking up sea shells and listening to 
the sounds of the ocean.
    
I remember the serene beauty of a clear star-studded night, the fragrance 
of flowers wafting in the air and the silver sheen of a brook tumbling on 
its way. All these scenes are the essence of international efforts to 
conserve the environment  clean air to breathe, pure water to drink and 
productive soil.
    
But will this natural bounty be available for our children? If we dont 
mend our ways, the answer is no. Fishermen no longer come to Clifton Beach. 
The sea is filled with carelessly discarded garbage. Empty cans and plastic 
trash have replaced the shells on the sand. And factories spew out 
chemicals and smoke, polluting our cities air.
    
For centuries, we took nature for granted, expecting it to replenish 
itself. But we cannot count on the Earth to heal itself. It is time we woke 
up to the reality of our responsibility to preserve the planet for our 
children and our childrens children.
    
One of the consequences of our irresponsible actions is the widening of the 
ozone layer, which is leading to the warming of our planet  a change that 
is melting glaciers and affecting the global climate. This development can 
have a devastating effect on crops and lead to famine and starvation. And 
some countries in our neighbourhood, like the Maldives and parts of 
Bangladesh, face even more serious consequences owing to the rising ocean 
level.
    
In Pakistan, we have made a modest beginning. We have set up the Marine 
Pollution Control Board, banned non-biodegradable plastic bags, planted 
millions of trees and taken steps to preserve our juniper forests (juniper 
trees grow only 1 inch a year).
    
But we still have a long way to go in explaining to and educating our 
people about the importance of protecting our environment and preserving 
the beauty of the natural world.
    
Our people  and the people of the world  need to realise that the 
planets environment is only as strong as its weakest link. Our ecological 
chain will snap unless every living organism has the wherewithal to fulfill 
its purpose in creation.
    
Our natural surroundings, from water to air to soil, are in a delicate 
balance. We can bring about the apocalypse at any time by neglecting our 
responsibility to preserve this order.
    
Can we rise to the challenge? I believe we have no choice  we must.
    
Large cities today suffer from inadequate infrastructure, poor roads and 
communication lines, erratic power supplies and overflowing sewage systems. 
More importantly, they suffer from administrative and financial 
mismanagement.
    
It is in the cities that we must begin our battle. We need fresh and 
innovative ways of management. We need cogeneration of resources, using the 
end-product of one industry, as the raw material of another. We need 
integrated treatment plants and more efforts to increase productivity and 
reduce costs.
    
The environment is a concern for us all. Every small effort makes a 
difference, and every individual can and should help.
    
Let us, individually and collectively, popularise the slogan Reduce, Reuse 
and Recycle. That is the goal of World Environment Day  and that should 
be our goal every day of the year.Copyright 1996 Dawn-Creators Syndicate,

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rifaat Hamid Ghani

CORRUPT, how? was the rejoinder everyone found memorable for his own 
reasons to Riz Khans question on corruption in Pakistan.
    
The Prime Ministers counter-question is indeed hard to answer. Where to 
begin? A Berlin business-researchers publication has come up with a rather 
precise answer: Pakistan is number two in their listing of the most corrupt 
countries in the world. With a proper respect for exactness, the journal 
elaborates that its listing does not include each and every country of the 
world. Just the ones the major industrial nations do business with. And the 
findings are only valid for one business year. If we stay the course, 
surely we can make it to number one in time for the next count. We repose 
full faith in our system and those who are presiding.
    
Corrupt, how? Intoning the phrase variously would be a good exercise for 
a lesson in diction at RADA or one of the theatre workshops the Arts 
Council ran recently. Consider the possibilities: Instead of the way the PM 
intoned it, it could be inflected: Corrupt? How corrupt! Thats the way 
the average Pakistani would say it, and does say it in the common course of 
conversation several times a day. A Yunus Habib, on the other hand, 
wondering whether he should offer wine, women or song or just cash to the 
VVIP would ask briskly of himself corrupt, how corrupt?
    
It is hard to imagine a context in Pakistan which would require thoughtful 
musing as to how to set about corrupting the incorruptible, or occasion the 
simple note of angry contradiction. But a good drama school would teach 
those tones as well, for however unlikely the eventuality, one must be 
prepared for the show to go on.
    
Actually it is not the kind of corruption the journal specifies that 
bothers common people. What does it matter to them whether a kickback is 
picked up for, lets suppose, an MIG or an F-10? That money would not be 
coming to them anyway, or helping improve their own living conditions. What 
hurts is the smaller, workday instances of corruption.
    
Contractors where half the money goes into individual pockets and the road 
repair is substandard. KESC wires that snap and fray too soon because 
purchase went astray. Telephones that get used by X and billed to Y. 
Services that people pay taxes for and dont receive. Government grants and 
donor money that gets used the wrong way by the wrong people. Scams. 
Joyrides. Rackets. State-paid Umras. Inflated entourages.
    
Not technically corruption at all, but what else to call it in a situation 
where taxes rise because the country is broke and its public 
representatives live like kings while the common man is slowly ground to 
dust, and the middle class lowers its standards each week? If we produce a 
society where only the corrupt can survive, isnt that the ultimate 
corruption?
    
Corrupt, how? Cheating at exams corrupt. Cheating with results. Rigging. 
Falsifying. Intimidating. Doling out employment, plots, excessive 
facilities at state expense to promote party interests and reward the 
faithful. Manipulating tariffs and taxes to make a killing.
    
What about the erosion of moral values? How insidiously corruption is 
projected as incidental to the times. Everyone does it; it happens 
everywhere. Look at Italy. Take Japan. What about Bofors, Hawala? So lets 
not even try to stop doing it here. Shrug your shoulders and take it for 
granted. Thats how corrupt. So corrupt in fact that corruption has lost 
its meaning. So corrupt we cannot even recognise corruption anymore.
    
Corrupt? With the economy booming, IMF smiling, deposits rising, MOUs 
mounting? Yes, corrupt. How? Disgustingly.

Omar Kureishi

WHAT is a passport? It is a travel document. It is no more than that and in 
most countries of the world it can be acquired through a post-office by 
filling in a simple form. It is no big deal except in Pakistan.
    
We have this genius for nit-picking and given the choice between a simple 
procedure and one that involves stepping through a bureaucratic mine-field, 
we will unhesitatingly choose the latter. Are we gluttons for punishment? 
One of the reasons for finding problems for every solution is that 
government offices are hopelessly overstaffed and there is not enough work 
and work has to be created and then sub-divided, the file as such, like the 
proverbial hat, has to be passed around and quite often for the same reason 
that a hat is passed around! 
   
Whatever bureaucracy does, it does the hard way, by bringing into play the 
whole coercive apparatus of the state, in the process reducing an applicant 
to a supplicant.
    
We have these high-sounding human rights organisations and I am surprised 
that none of them have turned their attention to the plight of an ordinary 
citizen, the confluence of whose unhappy stars, makes it necessary for him 
or her to go to a government office, any office to get even the most 
elementary form attested. I wont state the obvious. These hindrances, 
these obstacles provide an incentive for palm-greasing. But we are 
confronted by the age-old question: which came first, the chicken or the 
egg? Are government procedures deliberately cumbersome so that they can 
facilitate corruption or is corruption inevitable because the procedures 
are cumbersome?
    
I know that it is fashionable to blame the British for babu- bureaucracy 
and to some extent we would be right to do so. Thats the way the sahib 
dealt with the natives but the British left 50 years ago and one would have 
thought that we would have been able to devise some administrative 
improvements that were citizen- friendly. Before I get to Maulana Sattar 
Edhis difficulties with the passport department (since then resolved 
triumphantly) let me recount my own experience when I first applied for a 
passport. This was sometime in May 1947, that is to say in British India.
    
I had got a letter from the University of Southern California informing me 
that I had been accepted. The first thing I needed was a passport to get 
other formalities started. I was told that it wasnt all that simple and 
among other things, a police inquiry would be required. Inter alia, the 
same police inquiry that exists to the present day. I knew an Anglo-Indian 
Police Sergeant called Brown. His daughter Ninette studied in the same 
school as my sister. I went to see Sergeant Brown. He was a cheerful man, 
uncomplicated but he cautioned me that a Congress Ministry was in power and 
they tended to be self-righteous and very Jai Hind, as he put it in his 
Anglo - Indianese. 
   
Sergeant Brown loved his curry and rice but tended to be disparaging about 
these freedom-wallas. He said that he would do his best.
    
The point is that even in those days the shortest distance between two 
points was not a straight line. One had to devise artful ways of beating 
the system. He got my police clearance but there were other miles to go. 
The passport got stuck up in some factotums office. I was 19 years old and 
no babu was going to stop me from my tryst with destiny (which was to get a 
passport).
    
Accompanied by my cronies, Jagat Vats and Zavareh Kabraji, we decided to 
make a call on the chief minister. I think his name was B.G. Kher. Mainly 
through bluff and bluster we managed to meet him. I made a speech, accusing 
the Congress government of preventing a Muslim student from getting higher 
education. He had absolutely no idea of what I was saying but was 
sufficiently flustered to pass orders that I should be given my passport 
there and then. 
   
He then gently chided me and hoped that I wouldnt make a fool of myself 
when I got to the University as I had done a few minutes earlier.
    
Maulana Sattar Edhi, arguably one of the great men of our times, not only 
found that he was tripped by red-tape but if Press reports are to be 
believed, was treated in a somewhat cavalier fashion at the Passport 
Office. It is entirely possible that someone failed to recognise him but it 
is also possible that some high-minded official decided that rules being 
rules, no exceptions could be made. The latter is a bit fanciful but I am 
giving a best-case scenario.
    
If it can be established without any doubt that no exceptions are made, not 
even for Maulana Sattar Edhi, then its a good precedent. But we know that 
is not so. Or to take a more convoluted view, may be that not even Maulana 
Edhi is exempted from the usual terms of business. Maulana Edhis passport 
made front-page news but spare a thought for thousands of applicants who 
fall upon the barricades of bureaucratic bloody-mindedness.
    
There is one solution. That is to simplify the rules. A passport should be 
available on demand. We must also get into the habit of justifying the 
imposition of rules and regulations that so needlessly inconvenience the 
general public. For instance, we should be told why it is necessary to have 
a police enquiry for getting a passport. What exactly is the police 
expected to inquire into? 
    
That a citizen is a fit person to travel abroad? Who decides and what is 
the yard-stick? We spend too much time in finding macro solution to macro 
problems. We tend not to pay any heed to the availability of justice at the 
basement level. That is why as a society, we appear to be standing on our 
heads.

<a name="time">Time to put out your cigarette</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar R. Quraishi

KARACHI, May 30: Put out your cigarettes and cigars, extinguish your pipes, 
stop bothering others with your smoke. Friday, May 31, is World No-Tobacco 
Day and the World Health Organisation (WHO) wants you to up this harmful 
and wasteful habit.
    
The WHO and its member-nations every year dedicate the Day to what the 
WHOs parent body, the United Nations, calls the cause of ensuring a 
tobacco-free society.
    
This year, on the 8th such annual commemoration, the Day is dedicated to 
the theme Sport and the Arts without Tobacco and is sponsored by the United 
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) and the 
International Olympic Committee (IOC).
    
The WHO says that the growing tendency of star athletes, sports 
personalities and music and cultural celebrities being sponsored by tobacco 
organisations has a harmful effect on especially children and the younger 
generation.
    
An impressionable audience that often looks up to these personalities as 
excellent role-models, young people need to be shown images of people who 
are successful but at the same time lead a healthy smoke-free lifestyle, 
the WHO says.
    
This malleability  and the capability of sport and entertainment 
personalities to communicate and influence young people  is used, the WHO 
says, by tobacco companies to build up a positive image in society.
    
The WHO specifically mentions a government-sponsored initiative in the 
state of Victoria in Australia that uses a tax on the use of cigarettes to 
counter advertising and art and sport sponsorship by tobacco companies, and 
says that other governments should try to follow such examples. It further 
quotes a study that shows for every 1 per cent increase in such a tax, 
cigarette consumption can be expected to fall by half a percent.
    
Perhaps closer to home, the WHO gives the example of Nepal saying it is one 
of the few countries in the world  and a developing one at that  that has 
introduced a health tax on cigarettes. It has not only made tobacco smoking 
costly but also increasingly difficult, banning it in public places, 
transport and government offices and introducing health warnings with all 
tobacco advertising.
    
It has estimated that half of the adolescents who start smoking and 
continue throughout their lives will eventually die from tobacco-related 
diseases.
    
Recent data have confirmed, the WHO says, that smokers have a death rate 3 
times higher than non-smokers at all ages.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="sele">Selection of jr team makes Jansher unhappy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, June 4: Current squash worlds golden boy, Jansher Khan, expressed 
his anguish at the games governing body in the country over fielding of 
over-aged players in next months World Junior Squash Championship to be 
held at Cairo, Egypt.
    
Talking to Dawn during his brief stay in the city, the maestro termed 
Pakistan Squash Racket Federation (PSRF) decisions as unfair.
    
It is injustice with the deserving players as well as with the 
international body as the age limit is 19 whereas the selected boys are in 
their early 20s, the legend said.
    
Jansher, in the light of his experience, had no hesitation in saying that 
the selected boys were ordinary players. They were selected for the 
previous championship in New Zealand and all of them failed to go beyond 
the second round.
    
If the federation thinks that these boys will deliver the goods, well, I 
am sorry to say that they are mistaken because these guys have no talent 
which could make them top class players, the seven-time world champion 
said.
    
Jansher emphasised that PSRF was cheating the Professional Squash 
Association (PSA). We, the players, have taken the name of Pakistan to the 
highest level and the federation is trying to dent the countrys reputation 
by using illegal means. What happens if the PSA disqualifies the team and 
imposes a ban? Who would be responsible?
    
Jansher called for an immediate probe into the matter before things were 
out of hand.

<a name="cric">Cricketers in the political field</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

LONDON: Sportsmen, like people in show business or in politics, suffer from 
identity crisis when they are out of limelight or start to fade away. A 
great majority of them are lost for ever and also without trace. Some are 
known to have committed suicide for not being noticed, once out of focus. 
Some do make an effort to attract attention and remain active in public 
life as sports administrators or politician.
    
Not many however succeeded though but of course there are a few who reached 
the pinnacle of their adopted endeavours. Politics is one of such pursuits.
    
For Pakistan's former captain Imran Khan who has now stepped into the realm 
of politics which he once strongly abhorred, the crisis of identity was 
rarely there since he shot into limelight with 12 wickets in a Sydney Test 
and then later joined the rebels to play in World Series Cricket for Kerry 
Packer.
    
Somehow or the other he was involved and always in focus because of being a 
fine all-rounder of the game and also because of his playboy image.
    
But he surely is not the first cricketer to aim for high office of his 
country in politics. There were many before him in his own country and 
overseas. At home late Abdul Hafeez Kardar, Sarfraz Nawaz and opening 
batsman Aftab Gul had their own stint with politics. Sarfraz despite losing 
his seat in the provincial assembly in Punjab remains a sports adviser in 
the present government in Pakistan. Former hockey captain of Pakistan 
Akhtar Rasul was once a cabinet minister.
    
Whether Imran will make it to the top is a question which remains to be 
answered and only time will tell whether he makes it or fails to do so.
    
The only instance of a first class cricketer becoming a prime minister of 
his country is that of Sir Alec Douglas-Home who played for Middlesex in 
the twenties and for Oxford University.
    
Sir Edmund Barton of Australia was another, but he had not played first 
class cricket, only at club level. He did umpire in first class matches and 
achieved the honour of becoming the first prime minister of Australia in 
1901.
    
John Arlott, the famous commentator failed as a liberal candidate as did 
the handsome Ted Dexter who stood against James Callaghan, the future 
Labour prime minister of England.
    
C.B. Fry who excelled in Tests for England and was also as good at football 
having won a medal in the FA Cup final and a fine athlete and writer also 
had his ambitions dashed but he did serve on the League of Nations.
    
Lord Harris, an England captain became Governor of Bombay. Sir Robert 
Menzies, the late Prime Minister of Australia was known for his interest in 
cricket and so was Bob Hawke, prime minister in the eighties. He played 
grade cricket at Perth, Melbourne and Canberra and like Menzies played for 
the Prime Minister XI against visiting teams.
    
The present Prime Minister of Australia John Howard is another who is 
hooked on the game as is John Major of England, a club standard cricketer 
who is always seen watching Tests in England.
    
Ian McLachlan, once a 12th man for Australia in a Ashes Test of 1962/63 is 
now a cabinet minister in Australian government, he also gained 'blue' at 
Cambridge in 1957-58.
    
The Indians had their own share of cricketers leaping into the political 
arena. The recent being Manoj Prabhakar, Chetan Chauhan and Kirti Azad are 
also known to have indulged in it. Sunil Gavaskar is now the Sheriff of 
Bombay. Prince Duleepsinhji of Nawanagar who like his uncle Prince 
Ranjitsinhji played Test cricket for England was a High Commissioner of 
India to Australia in 1950.  New Zealand's Sir Edmund Blundell who played 
first class cricket was a High Commissioner in England and later became the 
Governor General of the New Zealand.
    
And if we look towards the Caribbean, we would find that there are many 
famous names in the game who became prominent figures in the politics of 
their country. Their famous all-rounder Learie Constantine of Trinidad and 
Tobago first became member of the parliament in the island later a high 
commissioner in England. He was knitted and at the time of his death, he 
was Lord Constantine.
    
Fearsome fast bowler Wesley Hall after he left the game entered politics 
and was made Sports Minister in Barbados government, so was left-handed Roy 
Fredericks in Guyana. Sir Frank Worrell had a stint as a Member of 
Parliament in Jamaica.
    
The list of those who have made it had those who have failed is a long and 
interesting one. Now, whether Imran will do any justice to his attempt in 
this direction will be watched with guarded interest by many.</pre>
