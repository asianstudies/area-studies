-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Nov 11: President Farooq Leghari had urged ousted Benazir 
Bhutto to resign with dignity on Nov 4 but she adamantly refused, a London-
based authoritative think-tank, Oxford Analytica, said in its latest 
analysis of the Pakistan situation.

She adamantly refused, believing that he would not act against her. On 
this front, she appears to have underestimated the extent of national 
opposition to her government, the analysis said.

It said although Mr Leghari was within his constitutional powers in 
dismissing Ms Bhutto, he could not have acted without the firm support of 
the army. Army Chief General Jahangir Karamat had privately expressed to 
both Leghari and Bhutto his displeasure over government behaviour.

The caretaker government  led by Malik Meraj Khalid, and backed by Mr 
Leghari and the army  is likely to initiate major social and structural 
reforms, and seek to tackle corruption across the political spectrum, it 
said.

The Bhutto governments lack of credibility and support could be judged by 
the fact that there were no protest demonstrations by the PPP against the 
presidents action. None of Ms Bhuttos former ministers was prepared to 
speak up in her defence after the sacking. Instead, many people openly 
celebrated her dismissal, notably in Lahore, the home city of opposition 
leader Nawaz Sharif, and Karachi, where the government has violently 
suppressed demands by local Mohajirs for political autonomy. Despite the 
presence of troops, the situation in Islamabad quickly returned to normal, 
it continued.

The interim government can be expected to take action on three main policy 
fronts, it said. The government is likely to launch a major crackdown on 
corruption across the political spectrum, but in particular focusing on 
Zardari. The president and the army are already believed to have built up 
files on alleged abuses of power, and firm action is likely to be popular 
with the general public.

<a name="chan">Changes in economy must: US think-tank</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Nov 10: The key thing for the new interim government in 
Pakistan is to begin structural changes in the economy, restore law and 
order and hold corrupt people to account, an international think tank and 
aid-donor foundation chief said on Saturday.
    
The reform agenda in Pakistan has to take a leap forward, George 
Perkovich, Director of the Secure World Programme at the W. Alton Jones 
Foundation, a $300 million grant-making organisation based in 
Charlottesville, said in an interview.
    
The interview was published by leading newspaper Washington Times as part 
of a full-page review of South Asia in which Pakistan was the only subject 
for news analysis and reports.
    
The papers Assistant Foreign Editor, Gus Constantine, said in a news 
analysis the ouster of Benazir Bhutto had returned power to its traditional 
holders, bureaucrats acting with the support of the army.
    
He quoted an unnamed US source saying the politicians have created a mess 
with rampant corruption, economic stagnation, inflation and budget 
deficits. The source was understood to be an official one.

Our Correspondent

JHANG, Nov 10: Every citizen can submit, to the proposed accountability 
commission, evidence and proof against corrupt politicians, government 
officials and businessmen.

The commission, to be a part of judiciary, will be set up shortly under a 
presidential order, says Syeda Abida Hussain, caretaker Federal Minister 
for Education, Science and Technology.

Addressing a Press conference here at Shah Jewana House on Saturday 
evening, she said the accountability process would not delay the Feb 3 
general elections. Abida said that former parliamentarians, if declared 
corrupt, would be debarred from contesting the elections. Those whose cases 
were decided after Feb 3, would be unseated if elected, she observed.

She said that corrupt elements would not only face disqualification (from 
contesting elections) or dismissal (from service) but would also have to 
pay the looted money. Political and out-of-merit recruitment would be 
cancelled.

<a name="pppv">PPP voices fears about caretaker cabinet
</a>-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, Nov 7: The central executive committee of the Pakistan Peoples 
Party has observed that certain steps taken by the caretaker government 
have endorsed its fears and made its credibility doubtful in the eyes of 
the people.

The PPPs highest policy-making body, which met in Islamabad on Wednesday 
with secretary-general Rafiq Ahmad Sheikh in the chair, cited the 
constitution of the federal cabinet and appointment of Mumtaz Ali Bhutto as 
caretaker chief minister of Sindh as the evidence which substantiates our 
suspicion

According to a party spokesman, two members of the cabinet are batch mates 
of the president in the civil services academy and one is related to him. 
This is nothing but clear nepotism by a person who claims to have an 
unblemished past. If the president has the courage to start with unfair 
practices only a day after he dissolved the National Assembly unlawfully, 
no-one is going to believe that his future steps will be above board, the 
spokesman says.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Nov 7: Caretaker Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid has indicated 
that his government plans to bar some politicians from contesting the 
forthcoming polls by disqualifying them through an accountability law 
likely to be enacted in a few days.
    
Well proceed according to the law. If anyone is disqualified under the 
law, he wont be allowed to contest the polls, he told newsmen during his 
first visit to the city here on Thursday after being sworn in as caretaker 
prime minister.
    
Malik Khalid said the accountability law would be drafted in a few days. He 
said the accountability had actually started and his government was taking 
economic, administrative and other measures in this regard.
    
He reassured the reporters that elections would be held on Feb 3 as 
promised by the president in the National Assembly dissolution order. He 
conceded that people were suspicious about the governments intentions to 
hold fresh polls. But, he said, it was due to the existing political 
polarisation and distrust.

The caretaker prime minister arrived here in the afternoon by an ordinary 
PIA flight. 
    
He was accorded a bare minimum security and protocol. No pilot car or 
motorcycle was present to lead him to the Governors House and then to the 
Alhamra Arts Centre where he attended a function.
    
The small flat owned by Malik Meraj Khalid in Laxmi Mansions (off Beadon 
Road) has been declared the Prime Ministers House, but only a uniformed 
constable and two plainclothesmen were guarding it.

<a name="sees">Benazir sees Legharis hand in Mirs killing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov 12: Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto on Tuesday 
implicated President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari in the murder of her 
brother, Mir Murtaza Bhutto, who was killed in a police shoot-out in 
Karachi on Sept 20.
    
Ms Bhutto, who was talking to newsmen after moving into a house owned by 
Senator Gulzar from her official residence, said: There is a nexus between 
my brothers death and Leghari.
    
She demanded of the President Leghari to bring back the British detectives 
called by her to investigate the killing of her estranged brother.
    
I ask Leghari that if your hands are clean bring back those British 
detectives else nobody in this country is going to believe you,  she said.
    
I always felt that my brothers death was part of a grand conspiracy 
against my government, she added.
    
She said the day her brother was killed she told her colleagues that nobody 
could dare kill prime ministers brother unless somebody more powerful 
and more strong had assured the killers that she (Bhutto) would no longer 
remain in power.
    
Ms Bhutto pointed out that she had set up a judicial commission to 
investigate the case but I was not satisfied. 
   
Therefore, she said, she had enlisted the services of the British 
investigating team comprising experts decorated by the Queen for solving 
some major international crimes.
    
She said she wanted a foreign team to investigate the case because they 
would not have any roots in the country nor they would be pressured, 
coerced or intimidated.
    
I wanted them to get to the bottom of the story, she said.
    
Ms Bhutto, whose detained husband has been charged by the president in the 
proclamation order for conspiring to kill Murtaza Bhutto, accused Mr 
Leghari for the first time directly in the incident.
    
The president has made some foul accusations. This convinces me that 
directly or indirectly there is a nexus between my brothers death and the 
president because he has tried to justify the presidential action in terms 
of my brothers death, she said.

<a name="inhe">Benazir inherited cruel streak of her father</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

NEW YORK, Nov 12: The fall of Bhuttos is a family tragedy and a national 
one for Pakistan. The glorious legacy Zulfikar Ali Bhutto hoped to leave 
his children, tightly held for almost half a decade by his daughter, lies 
in ashes, says Stanley Wolpert.
    
In an article in Tuesdays New York Times, the author of books on Quaid-i-
Azam and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, says: Few Pakistanis mourn the dismissal of 
Benazir Bhutto any more than they mourn the fate of her father.
    
Wolpert who was commissioned by Ms Bhutto to write a biography of her 
father, says of Ms Bhutto: She staged a bloody crackdown on armed rivals 
who conducted a campaign against her in Karachi. She directed a campaign of 
harassment against judges and reporters. Meanwhile, her husband, Asif Ali 
Zardari, has been widely accused of enriching himself from government 
contracts.
    
Lamenting Ms Bhuttos failed rule, he observes: It was a brief interlude 
of hope and pride, specially throughout the Sindh province, where cries of 
Jiye Bhutto greeted the prime minister.
   
But that euphoria quickly ended, even among those who worked closely with 
her in the Pakistan Peoples Party. Instead of focusing on efforts to help 
develop the economy and trying to provide education and work for tens of 
millions of poor Pakistanis, Prime Minister Bhutto worried about how best 
to immortalise her father, planning costly monuments and hoping to persuade 
the world court to exonerate him.
    
Wolpert concludes that Ms Bhutto inherited her fathers charisma, passion 
for politics and insatiable ambition, but also his cruel streak and 
willingness to undermine democratic institutions.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz wants ID condition for voting</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov 13: Leader of the Opposition Mian Nawaz Sharif held here on 
Wednesday a detailed meeting with caretaker prime minister Malik Meraj 
Khalid and demanded from him the reconstitution of Election Commission and 
the production of ID cards compulsory in the February 3 elections.

While he stressed the need for producing National Identity Card for polling 
vote, he also called for the retention of October 1993 election 
constituencies to ensure fair and free elections in accordance with the 
constitutional requirements.
    
The leader of the opposition also gave a letter to the caretaker prime 
minister in which he discussed nine proposals for having transparent 
elections throughout the country.
    
The most important pre-requisite for free and fair elections was an 
independent election commission. As required under Article 218 of the 
Constitution, a new election commission should be re-constituted, as early 
as possible, he added.

OVERSEAS PAKISTANIS: It is vital that millions of Pakistani voters living 
abroad should be given the right to vote. The Supreme Court had decided on 
15 November, 1993 that voters registered in Pakistan and living abroad 
cannot be denied their right of vote and the government should make 
arrangements to enable them to vote at the next general elections.
    
The chief election commissioner accordingly asked the ministry of law to 
amend the relevant laws to enable the Election Commission to appoint 
returning o officers in locations abroad with a large Pakistani population.
    
On 8 November, 1994 it also asked the ministry of foreign affairs to study 
arrangements for this purpose. Just before the October 1993 elections, he 
said the PML had made certain proposals in its letter dated 15 September, 
1993 to extend voting facilities to the overseas Pakistanis. This was 
followed by more detailed proposals in July 1994.

<a name="getr">Get rid of feudal lords in assemblies</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Nov 13: Caretaker Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid said here on 
Wednesday that time had come to get rid of feudal lords who had no interest 
in peoples problems but had been occupying assembly seats generation after 
generation.

Addressing a function arranged by a local traders group, Mr Meraj Khalid 
said although his governments term was limited to 90 days, it would devise 
strategies to streamline the much messed up political and economic matters 
and ensure that the next government followed the guidelines given.

He said his government did not want to postpone elections fixed for Feb 3 
next year on any pretext, but would introduce the accountability law at any 
cost. This law, he said, would cleanse the political arena of feudal lords 
who always managed to return to assemblies only to plunder public funds and 
grossly misuse their positions causing all sorts of problems for the 
society.

It now depends on the nation to help the caretaker government in achieving 
the goal of providing clean governance to the country. February 3 is going 
to be a decisive day in our history. Hopefully, the people will give a bold 
verdict and reject parties which did not prove worthy of the voters 
trust, Mr Khalid said.

<a name="imfw">IMF, WB pledge to help revamp economy: Burki</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov 10: Adviser to the caretaker Prime Minister on Finance, 
Planning and Economic Affairs Shahid Javed Burki on Saturday announced his 
structural reforms programme to revamp the flagging economy and disclosed 
that the World Bank and the IMF would offer more resources to attain the 
objective.
    
We are determined to devise a mechanism to stop slippages and corruption. 
While the IMF has promised to provide a new funding line other than the one 
already pledged, the World Bank too would be extending generous resources 
to help improve the countrys overall economy, he added.
 
Speaking at a news conference immediately after taking the charge of the 
finance ministry, he pointed out that the job of the caretaker government 
was to revamp the economy by providing what he termed a solid base. 
President Leghari has assured me that the policies introduced by the 
caretaker government would continue beyond 90 days specially during his 
(Legharis) remaining two years in office.
    
He said he planned to pick up the thread from where Mr Moeen Qurashi had 
left to bring about a qualitative change in the socio-economic scene and 
with a view to ensuring a sustained economic growth.
 
Mr Burki pointed out that a number of task forces had been set up to 
recommend improvements in the following areas: Fiscal reforms, review of 
public expenditure and acceleration of the privatisation process.
    
Its a fairly difficult task, but we would certainly try to achieve our 
objective of reforming the economy, he said.

<a name="pici">PICIC, IDBP scare siphons off Rs 165m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Nov 10: Two leading financial institutions witnessed a virtual 
panic run on Sunday resulting in withdrawal of Rs 165 million from their 
deposits following a statement of caretaker Advisor on Finance Mr Shahid 
Javed Burki.
    
In his first press conference at Islamabad on Saturday, Mr Burki was quoted 
by official news agency APP as saying that the government plans to abolish 
and consolidate various financial institutions including the Pakistan 
Banking Council, Industrial Development Bank of Pakistan (IDBP), Pakistan 
Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC) and Regional 
Development Finance Corporation.
    
While IDBP reported withdrawal of Rs 95.0 million from its deposits, the 
PICIC lost Rs 70 million on Sunday, the first working day of the week, 
officials of the two institutions informed Dawn.
    
There was a huge withdrawal of Rs 70 million from PICIC offices across the 
country today, a senior official of the corporation told Dawn adding the 
normal daily withdrawals range between Rs 5.0 million to Rs 10 million.
    
We lost to our depositors Rs 95 million throughout Pakistan, said an IDBP 
official. He termed the withdrawal unusually high compared with normal 
withdrawals which he could not quantify.
    
Both the officials said PICIC and IDBP brought the huge withdrawals to the 
notice of the ministry of finance relating the same to the newspaper 
reports about the possible winding up of PICIC and IDBP attributed to Mr 
Burki.
    
The ministry responded quickly and issued a clarification  also carried by 
official news agency APP  saying the government had no plans to abolish 
PICIC and IDBP or any other financial institutions for that matter.
    
But by the time the clarification was flashed by APP in the afternoon the 
damage was done. PICIC share value dropped to Rs 6.0 from Rs 9.0 recorded 
on last trading day depicting the confidence-shaking of the investors. 
Once something shakes the confidence of the investors it is very hard to 
rebuild it, remarked a senior PICIC official.
    
He said out of the total Rs 70 million worth of withdrawals on Sunday Rs 16 
million flew out from PICIC offices in Karachi alone. He said the panicky 
depositors made a run not only on current and saving accounts but also on 
term-deposit accounts. The run was so severe that it also wiped out the 
daily inflow of around Rs 5.0 million in our recently-announced term-
deposit scheme with life insurance.
    
He said the issuance of a clarification by the ministry of finance would 
probably halt further withdrawals from PICIC but it would not be of much 
help in securing back the lost deposits.

<a name="wbsm">WBs magic man to revamp the economy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

THE BAD news, despite the change of government is that the Rs. 41 billion 
package of the IMF-approved additional budgetary measures announced late 
last month would stay. But, the good news is, World Banks another miracle 
man Shahid Javed Burki is coming to Pakistan to set the countrys economic 
house in order within three months.
    
Burki had actively helped the former caretaker prime minister Moin Qureshi 
during the latters three month tenure in August-October, 1993, but from 
behind the scene.
    
He would now have an opportunity to begin from where he had left off. He 
would do well by losing little time in criticising the economic policies of 
the previous government and paying more attention to remedying the 
situation in the short time he has been allowed for the job.
    
There is hardly anything which he does not know about Pakistans economy. 
And his experiences in the World Bank as the incharge, first at the China 
desk and then at the Latin American desk, should enable him to tackle the 
problems confronting the economy of his own country with greater dexterity 
and despatch.
    
Burkis recent newspaper articles on Pakistans economy give a clue to his 
thinking on the subject. He surely must have some ready made prescriptions 
for the sickness from which our economy is afflicted with.
    
To start with, there is this problem of abysmally low savings rate which 
has continued to keep the rate of investment even with borrowed resources 
at equally low levels of around 18- 19 per cent affecting adversely the 
rate of economic growth while the population has been galloping at the rate 
of 3.5 per cent.
    
This problem is directly related to the problem of massive tax evasion in 
the country where out of a population of 120 million, only one million pay 
taxes. And this problem has two dimensions. One, the corrupt to the core 
personnel in the CBR. Second, our national culture of contacts and 
influence.
    
It should not be difficult for the new finance minister to get the economic 
wing of the FIA to give him the real low-down on all the CBR field staff 
who live beyond their legitimate means. And using the existing rules he can 
send them all home. This will take care of more than half the problem. The 
other half, that is the problem of culture or contact would wither away in 
time on its own if bribes, contacts and influence fail over time to yield 
the desired results for the tax evaders.
    
Moreover, not only the income tax rates in Pakistan are forbiddingly high, 
but the slabs are also too many making the whole exercise of filing income 
tax returns highly complex and cumbersome for the honest tax payers.
    
It would make every Pakistani into an honest tax payer if all slabs are 
abolished and every one earning more than Rs. 60,000 a year (whatever be 
the source of income) is asked to pay 10 per cent of their income as income 
tax.
    
Also, if all excise duties and existing sales tax are removed and a 5 to 10 
per cent consumption tax( at every point of consumption ) is imposed in a 
graduated manner (affecting luxury consumptions the most and not affecting 
at all food items and such other essentials), not only the entire economy 
will get documented but the collection would be more than what one is 
getting from the existing indirect taxes.
    
Simultaneously, the interim government could consider lowering the maximum 
import tariff rates to 35 per cent. This will bring down the cost of 
imported raw materials and intermediaries.
    
All these steps will have a salutary effect on the overall rate of savings 
and investment , consequently pushing up the rate of economic growth to the 
desired levels.
    
In the meanwhile, the interim government could consider speeding up the 
process of privatisation of the nationalised commercial banks and public 
sector investment banks. One commercial bank and one investment bank in the 
hands of the government should more than suffice.
    
A banking sector largely in the private sector would ensure that bank 
defaults remain within reasonable limits and no advances are made on the 
basis of political influence or other non-economic factors.
    
The menace of burgeoning budgetary deficit could also be tackled by the 
interim government first by dismantling all the unwanted divisions, 
ministries and departments ruthlessly, without being afflicted by the 
thought that the action would result in intensifying the problem of 
joblessness. More money in the hands of the private sector would finance 
increased economic activities creating more jobs which would eventually 
take care of those who will lose jobs by the reduction in the size of the 
government.
    
Shahid Javed Burki like most of his technocrat colleagues is a great 
champion of the idea of making the agriculturists pay tax on their incomes. 
The ousted government had taken a decision in principle to impose the tax 
after having reached an agreement with the IMF. Now all that is required is 
to impose the tax which the interim government should shirk away from on 
the excuse of having no mandate to take such steps.
    
While at it, Mr. Burki can also look into the logistics of collection of 
this tax without, on the one hand, letting the collectors harass the tax 
payers and, on the other, making it impossible for the agriculturists to 
evade their legitimate dues. This way, he can ensure collection of more 
than Rs. 2 billion, the previous government had estimated under this head. 
According to one calculation, if he goes about it in the right way, may 
succeed in ensuring collection of more than Rs. 20 billion in the first 
year.
    
With more revenues in hand and less government to look after, enough 
financial space would be created for taking in hand well thought out socio-
economic development projects having the right priority in the national 
scheme of things.
    
However, in order to ensure that the annual borrowing limits are not 
breached by even a billion, it would be advisable to bring in a clear cut 
law making it punishable by demotion or dismissal if any project director 
comes back with an escalated financial re-evaluation of his project before 
the end of the year.
    
The President in his address to the nation on Nov. 5 rightly said that only 
an elected government had the mandate to bring in far reaching changes in 
the economy and other sector of national life. But the points raised above 
have received bipartisan support from both the large parties from time to 
time. Both the Muslim League and the PPP whether they were in power or out 
of power have supported these ideas. Some of these points are also 
mentioned in their election manifestos. So, if the interim government takes 
some unilateral actions on these issues, they would actually be only 
helping out in advance the party which will win the next elections.

<a name="priv">Privatisation proceeds only for debt retirement</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

The caretaker government has started looking for new avenues to generate 
funds and all the five major public sector corporations were being asked to 
urgently clear their dues to ease the current acute treasury position. 
   
With the change in the government the World Bank and the IMF are said have 
called upon Pakistan to implement their agreement in letter and spirit to 
receive $360 million for Pakistan. This includes $160 million of the IMF 
and $200 million from the World Bank on account of Social Action 
Programme(SAP).
    
It was in this context that new caretaker government headed by Malik Miraj 
Khalid has asked the officials of the five major corporations to clear 
their dues as was decided by dismissed PPP government. 
   
Regular instructions to the authorities of the major corporations were 
issued to clear their dues failing which strict action would be taken 
against them. A fresh move has been made for the recovery of government 
dues from various organisations so as to improve the liquidity position.
   
The new government has pledged to live in its financial means and President 
Leghari has reportedly directed the new caretaker prime minister to ensure 
cut in non development expenditure. The previous government had even cut 
its development budget and funds worth Rs.20 billion are to be taken away 
by the government due to which many development projects are likely to face 
lot of problems.
   
Even the Karachi Mass Transit System will now be delayed for one year. The 
Rs. 25 billion project would not get Rs.2 billion during the current 
financial year as the new government is also not in a position to arrange 
funds for this project.
   
Major corporations which have been asked to clear their dues include OGDC, 
Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) and State Cement Corporation of Pakistan (SCCP). 
To deal with this issue the previous government had first held a top level 
meeting presided over by ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto.
   
According to the minutes of that meeting, the following decisions were 
taken and reportedly being pursued by the caretaker government. WAPDA - 
Privatisation proceeds from Kot-Addu must be used for retirement of WAPDA 
debt.
   
The State Bank will reverse the transfers of any such proceeds to federal 
government. However, no amount of proceeds will be used for payment of 
interest or any other revenue expenditure of WAPDA. WAPDA was to pay 
arrears of its liabilities in first four months by the end of October, 96.
   
With a view to improving the financial position of WAPDA it was further 
decided that 10 per cent disinvestment of Kot Addu will be effected 
immediately at the original price of disinvestment. The proceeds from this 
would be used by WAPDA. WAPDA will ensure timely payment of its dues to the 
government and will re-examine its development budget with a view to 
facilitating payment of its obligations to the government. Low priority 
projects, wherever needed, will be cut down.
   
PTCL must clear its dues to the Ministry of Finance as early as possible. 
Thereafter, all obligations will be paid as and when they fall due. 
Proceeds from securitisation of PTCLs receivables should be used to make 
payments for the arrears of principal and interest of foreign re-lent loans 
paid by the EAD on PTCs behalf.
  
The State Cement Corporation - SCC will make payments to the government of 
all outstanding arrears on account of foreign cash development loans/debt 
servicing liability. The SCC will transfer to the government the balance of 
cement development surcharge, if any.
  
The SCC will take immediate action to relieve itself of responsibility for 
running cement factories which have been sold but where disposal has been 
held up by stay orders. The OGDC would reconcile the position of its dues 
owed to the Ministry of Finance.
  
The SNGPL must discharge its liabilities of OGDC immediately. If needed, 
SNGPL may review its development projects with a view to facilitating 
payment of dues to the OGDC. Regarding the Pakistan Steel Mills, a 
committee was to examine the financial position of the Mills.
   
The PSM, however, was asked to pay all its dues to the government or 
Banks/DFIs. It is said that the caretaker government has particularly 
decided to look into cases of corruption and financial mismanagement of the 
PSM due to which things are deemed to have deteriorated.

<a name="paki">Pakistan to get $160m IMF loan by next week</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov 13: Pakistan is expected to receive two tranches of $160 
million ($80 million each), immediately from the IMF after the signing of 
an agreement on Standby Arrangements before the end of next week.
    
An Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) worth $1.5 billion is 
also expected to be finalised by about this time following which about $200 
million would be released by the Fund under this arrangement.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here on Thursday that the visiting head of the 
IMF delegation, Mr Paul Chabrier, held a long meeting here on Wednesday 
with caretaker prime ministers adviser on finance, Mr Shahid Javed Burki, 
and discussed with him details of both the agreements.
    
There would be a special cabinet meeting on Thursday which would be 
apprised about the new funding arrangement with the IMF.
    
The former Bhutto government had already negotiated a fresh agreement with 
the Fund for securing $160 million as part of two tranches of 600 million 
dollars Standby Arrangements. The third instalment of $80 million was due 
in December.

<a name="care">Caretakers firm to bring tariff down to 35% soon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Nov 13 : The Task Force on Tariff reforms met here on Wednesday 
under the chairmanship of Minister for Commerce, Muhammad Zubair Khan and 
constituted 5 sub-committees to mainly propose bringing down tariffs to 35 
per cent, as early as possible.
    
The Task Force had been set up on the instructions of Prime Ministers 
Advisor on Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs, Mr Shahid Javed Burki. 
He is said to have assured the World bank and the IMF to rationalise 
Pakistans tariff structure specially bringing it down to 35 per cent.
    
Although World Trade Organisation (WTO) has decided not to call for 
minimising the tariff rate to 35 per cent and given time to year 2003, the 
World Bank and the IMF are said to be exerting pressure on the caretakers 
to do the job within 90 days. They wanted to have the tariffs reduced to 35 
per cent by the caretakers who should also set time-frame for its 
implementation which should be unchanged and the president Farooq Leghari 
who has two more years in power should guarantee its continued 
implementation.

<a name="kse1">KSE 100-share index breaks 1,500 points barrier</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 13: Stocks maintained their recovery drive on Wednesday as 
blue chips rose further on heavy buying originating mainly from the 
institutional traders but the market lacked general support.
 
The filing of petition against the dissolution of the National Assembly by 
the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the speaker seeking the 
Supreme Court verdict on the issue and restoration of the government evoked 
mixed reaction in the rings, although it certainly added to the uncertain 
future outlook, dealers said.
 
However, the KSE 100-share index finished with an extended gain of 24.14 
points at 1,506.72, breaking the 1,500 barrier, although the underlying 
sentiment remained highly volatile.
    
After losing massively in pre-mid week trading, the index gained 32 points 
during the last two sessions and whether or not it maintains its recovery 
tempo at the weekend session too is anybodys guess.
    
Opinions about the near-term direction of the market are, therefore, 
divided but there is a near-consensus among leading brokers that the index 
could hover around the current level, fluctuating either-way by about 50 
points.
    
Analysts said the current political uncertainty will continue to take its 
toll as investors might not like to hold long positions until the Supreme 
Court gives its final judgement on the two petitions.
    
And added to it are uncertainties tied to the February 3 elections, notably 
their outcome and economic policies of the winning parties, they stated.
    
So, there is not a single psychological depressant but a number of them, 
which will continue to haunt investors during the next three months.
    
Floor brokers said the market could witness flutter here and there but the 
outlook will remain uncertain until the political situation is clear.
    
That was perhaps why investors did not go beyond safe haven and indulged in 
alternate bouts of buying and selling in half a dozen sound shares.
    
However, some of the bank, cement, energy and chemical shares came in for 
active support at the lower levels and have raised hopes that the sailing 
on these counters will be relatively smooth.
    
Big gainers were, therefore, led by Askari Bank, Bank of Punjab, MCB, 
Cherat Cement, PSO, Sui Southern, ICI Pakistan and Fauji Fertiliser, which 
posted gains ranging from Rs 1.25 to Rs 2.75.
    
Other good gainers were led by 11th, 12th and 16th ICP, Central Insurance, 
J. K. Spinning, ICC Textiles, Hinopak Motors and Pak Datacom, which also 
finished modestly higher on active short-covering at the lower levels.
    
Losses on the other hand were mostly fractional and reflected lack of large 
selling barring PEL Appliances and Philips, which suffered steep decline 
ranging from Rs 14 to Rs 29 on news of lower sales owing to the imposition 
of sales tax.
    
Dadabhoy Insurance, which showed good gains during the last two sessions, 
again came in for profit-selling and was marked down by Rs 10.
    
Bannu Woollen, Javed Omer, Sapphire Fibre, Siemens Pakistan, BOC Pakistan 
and Engro Chemicals, which suffered fall ranging from rupee one to Rs 1.75, 
were among the other leading losers.
    
Trading volume suffered a modest fall at 42.284 million shares as compared 
to 45.167 million shares a day earlier owing to the absence of leading 
sellers.
    
Hub-Power again topped the list of most actives, up 75 paisa on 13.915 
million shares, followed by PTC vouchers, up 55 paisa on 9.565 million, 
Dewan Salman, firm 65 paisa on 9.401 million, ICI Pakistan (r), steady 15 
paisa on 3.425 million, and Dhan Fibre, higher 55 paisa on 1 million 
shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by ICI Pakistan, up 65 paisa on 
0.910m, Fauji Fertiliser, higher Rs 2.75 on 0550m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, 
firm 65 paisa on 0.450m, Pakland Cement, easy 25 paisa on 0.156m, MCB, up 
Rs 1.25 on 0.137m, Faysal Bank, higher 85 paisa on 0.136m, and Askari Bank, 
up Rs 1.15 on 0.110m shares.
 
There were 287 actives, which came in for trading, out of which 101 shares 
rose, 118 fell with 68 holding on to the last levels.
    
On the corporate front, the board of directors of Century Paper has 
declared cash dividend at the rate of 10 per cent plus bonus shares of an 
identical amount for the year ended June 30, 1996.
    
The directors of Hilal Tanneries, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation 
and Shaffi Chemicals have omitted the dividend for the same period.

<a name="1111">1,111 disastrous days</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

WHAT has Benazir left for us? An impoverished country, many more poor 
people, many more illiterates, and a damaged international reputation.
    
What has she gained for herself and her family? Wealth robbed from the 
nation, a very ill and heart-broken mother, a murdered brother, a brother-
in-law accused of murder, a defamed husband.
    
Benazir and her PPP stalwarts say they will fight back. Of course they 
will. They never had it so good. The fight, they say, will be for 
democracy. Are they democrats? Their fight will be for the reacquisition of 
power and pelf.
    
As for Ghinwa Bhutto, placed as she now so unfortunately is, I asked her 
what it is she wants for herself and her children. A mature young woman, 
for her 34 years of life, she wants her husbands murderers found and 
punished, and she wishes to secure for her children the legacy that is 
theirs by birth. A difficult agenda, but she has her priorities right.
    
What support has she from Mirs family? None, apart from that of her 
mother-in-law, she admitted  and Nusrat, very ill, has become extremely 
forgetful. She wishes to live in her home at 70 Clifton with Ghinwa and her 
children, but is not allowed to by her daughter. After Mirs death and her 
return from abroad, Nusrat came to Ghinwa one evening saying she would like 
to stay with her. She stayed the night, and the next morning before the 
household awoke Benazir arrived with muscle woman Rukhsana Bangash and 
whisked Nusrat away. Ghinwa was told that that Nusrat had gone on Umra. But 
she had no idea that day where she was at the moment.
    
I asked if there had been any rapprochement meetings before Murtazas 
murder regarding the settlement of any political or property disputes 
between brother and sister. The sister had sent her messenger, to inform 
Mir that, to start with, he would have to part with half the library built 
up by Zulfikar and housed in 70 Clifton (about which ZAB himself used to 
boast that most of the books had been acquired with other peoples money) 
and half of his gun and carpet collection (most of which were gifted). Mir 
had felt highly affronted and the messenger was shown the door.
    
Why are you not represented before the inquiry tribunal headed by Justice 
Nasir Aslam Zahid that is determining the circumstances of Mirs death, I 
asked. She did not agree with the limited terms of reference under which 
the tribunal was inquiring, and which stipulated that its report, when 
finalised, would be handed over to the home department of the Government of 
Sindh  in other words, to Home Minister Abdullah Shah. This meant, at the 
time we met, that it would never be made public. She would agree to be 
represented with the terms of reference expanded and with the proviso that 
the report be submitted to either the President or the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan for publication. And, with finality, she said that she was 
restrained by people and circumstances which she felt too embarrassed 
to discuss.
    
I explained that Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah had ordered that the 
tribunal be headed by one of his most fair and fearless judges, with whom 
sits Justice Dr Ghous Mohammed and Justice Amanullah Abbasi about whom only 
good is said. She could not hope for a better panel. These judges would not 
necessarily feel restricted in any way in their ascertaining of facts. Her 
representation at the tribunal can only help her cause. As for her personal 
restraints, with the dismissal and fall of Benazir and her government, 
these should largely lessen. I hope Ghinwa will now arrange to be 
represented before the tribunal, inform them of what she knows and feels, 
and exhibit to the judges the recording of the last Press conference held 
by Mir four hours before he died.
    
Tumandar Leghari must be praised for finding the gumption to do what he has 
done. Had he only done it six months earlier, we would have been better 
off. After the seventh day of the dissolution, he must stop talking about 
elections in three months. First there has to be accountability, and 
maximum recovery of what we have lost. Then, a census, which has not been 
held for 16 years. The engine of democracy can only be run by democrats, 
people who feel for the people. 
   
A constitution is made for the good (only the good) of the people. It 
cannot be read or interpreted otherwise. It cannot and should not be used 
to facilitate the designs of robbers.
    
Malik Mehraj Khalid, a good reasonable man of 80 years, prone to doing 
right, wore at his swearing-in what he has always worn rather than the 
costume innovated for the ushers at the court of Emperor Akbar.
    
We are happy that Lt.-General Sahibzada Yaqub Khan is our foreign minister 
and not our COAS. He understands the Great Game and is also attuned to the 
Americans. Should the forces of evil attack us, the Seventh Fleet will have 
anchored by the time our fuel and spares run out.
    
Shahid Javed Burki knows his finance and is held in high esteem in the 
capital of the world. Mohtarma Syeda Abida Hussain and Omar Afridi are good 
choices. Shahid Hamid has good portfolios  Defence and Establishment. He 
should be able to maintain a working relationship and liase with the 
fountainhead. The rest will have to prove themselves.
    
Fakhruddin has constantly and forcefully criticised Article 58(2)B under 
which he has now benefited and sworn an oath. Accountability in his hands 
will falter. Who will he side with while giving his opinion when Benazir 
goes to court seeking the restoration of her government? What sort of 
advice can he give the President?
    
The President must undoubtedly know that contrary to the advice of Finance 
Minister Babar Ali, Moeen had installed M.B. Abbasi as head of the NDFC. 
Moeen should come back and count how much Abbasi has made us lose. The 
National Bank of Pakistan, which he now heads, once a very prestigious bank 
and the only Pakistani bank whose letters of credit were accepted abroad, 
has been downgraded by Moodys to an E+ rating.
    
As this goes to Press, Governor Kamaluddin Azfar is still in the Governors 
House. Azfar has throughout his term in office aligned himself with Syed 
Abdullah Shah, his chief minister, and been a party to, among other things, 
the horrifying case of Feroza Begum and her son. He cannot approbate or 
reprobate. Send him home, Mr President.

<a name="down">Down the same dismal road</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

HOW many times have we been down this road before and yet how amazing that 
we learn nothing from the journey. Politicians no sooner in office than 
they begin to tempt the fates and Presidents, after using Article 58(2)b of 
the constitution, stuck repeatedly between the need to appear impartial and 
the more overriding need to justify their deed.
    
For any caretaker arrangement to have credibility it must be seen as 
neutral. It must not take sides no matter what the provocation or how 
corrupt and inglorious the government which it has just shown the door. Yet 
no sooner does a President dismiss a government than he has to submit 
himself to two necessities: first, to prove and justify his action and, 
second, to ensure that the dismissed government does not return to power. 
This virtually pushes him into a partisan corner, the more so because the 
dismissed entity usually loses no time in making him  that is, the 
President  its foremost target.
    
This is what happened in 1990 when Benazir Bhutto was dismissed by Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan and this is what is happening again now that Benazir has 
received her dismissal orders for the second time in her tumultuous career 
at the hands of her one-time lieutenant and confidant, Sardar Farooq 
Leghari. The caretaker set-up now in place is not as blatantly partisan as 
the team Ishaq chose in 1990. But for all that it has a distinct anti-PPP 
flavour. Consider some examples. The caretaker chief minister of Sindh, 
Mumtaz Bhutto, who makes Jam Sadiq Ali look like a soft cake, is no apostle 
of neutrality. Much the same can be said of Zafarullah Jamali in 
Balochistan who, even if not overtly anti- PPP, is a politician with his 
own axe to grind. The former PPP men taken into the federal cabinet 
(Shafqat Mehmood and Javed Jabbar) are disgruntled souls. Even Malik Meraj 
Khalid, who for all his unassuming manner is no ones fool, has had his 
differences with the former prime minister.
    
More questionable than this anti-PPP bias  which Benazir can be expected 
to put to good use when she again plays the martyr, a role which she has 
honed to perfection  has been the stance of the army. No explanation has 
been forthcoming as to why army detachments had to be used to seal off the 
Prime Ministers house on the morning of the governments dismissal. No one 
will deny the armys key role in national affairs but why must it be so 
obtrusive about its actions?
    
The caretaker set-up has also not been able to give a satisfactory 
explanation for Asif Zardaris detention. If there are criminal charges 
against him, by all means arrest him. But if there is no evidence on this 
count (which is not the same thing as saying that he is innocent), he 
should be allowed to walk a free man. Husband and wife may have presided 
over the most corrupt dispensation in Pakistans history  the 
circumstantial evidence in this regard being mind-boggling  but that is no 
excuse for denying them due process under the law.
    
Indeed, what the caretaker government is proving is that a week is a long 
time in politics. It has been unable to explain its priorities or remove 
the growing confusion in the public mind about whether circumstances can 
arise in which accountability takes precedence over elections. And it has 
not been able to give a satisfactory explanation for Benazirs dismissal. 
The presidential order dissolving the National Assembly is a masterpiece of 
clumsy drafting, while the Presidents address on radio and television was 
a public relations disaster. Even if a murder takes place in broad daylight 
it still has to be proved in court. The evil of Ms Bhuttos tale has not 
been adequately presented before the people of Pakistan.
    
The presidential proclamation rests heavily on three reasons for the 
governments dismissal: the violation of human rights in Karachi, the 
killing of Murtaza Bhutto and the hurdles raised by the government in the 
way of implementing the Supreme Courts verdict in the Judges Case. 
Examined closely, these reasons appear to be less than convincing.
    
Of course human rights violations have occurred in Karachi but, if there be 
any honesty in the matter, when they did happen they evoked little outrage 
on the part of the army or the presidency. Leghari and Benazir fell out for 
different reasons but certainly not over the situation in Karachi. In fact, 
if Benazir Bhutto can be credited with any single achievement it is for 
having crushed the MQMs mini-insurgency, something which the army itself 
found hard to do. In the zeal to make a damning enough case against Benazir 
Bhutto, it would be a pity if the clock was turned back in Karachi. 
Certainly the MQM should be brought in from the cold and certainly police 
excesses should be checked and investigated, but care should be exercised 
that in doing so the MQM is not allowed to resurrect its former reign of 
terror. In any case, proving the PPP leaderships direct involvement in the 
extra-judicial killings in Karachi, while certainly possible, will not be 
easy.
    
As for the hearings into Murtaza Bhuttos killing, no one knows what may 
happen tomorrow but with the DIG and SSP comprehensively contradicting each 
other, no vital link with Zardari, as the authorities might have hoped for, 
has so far emerged. Unless it does, it becomes a problem slapping criminal 
charges on him.
    
This leaves the verdict in the Judges Case. But the proclamation itself 
only avers that the government dilly-dallied in implementing it. 
Reprehensible though such procrastination may be, it hardly furnishes 
enough grounds for dismissing an elected government.
    
This does not mean that there were no grounds at all for dismissing what 
arguably was the most disastrous government in the countrys history. But 
it does mean that the President has not really succeeded in making out a 
convincing case for his action. Nor is this just an academic point because 
unless the President gives a more Churchillian performance, and unless the 
caretaker set-up is shorn of its anti-PPP bias, the danger will remain of a 
section of the electorate denouncing the results of the coming elections. 
There are not many more cycles of protest and upheaval that Pakistan can 
afford.
    
It is, however, one of the in-built contradictions of the Eighth Amendment 
that true neutrality in a caretaker set-up can never be guaranteed unless 
the axe-wielder too steps down after chopping the head of his victim. 
Something close to this happened in the latter half of 1993 when both Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif and President Ishaq agreed to step down together. 
Despite the reservations that Nawaz Sharif later came to entertain about 
the caretaker administration headed by Moeen Qureshi (a man who for all his 
other qualities was obsessed by the need for self- publicity) that was by 
and large a neutral government and it conducted a fair election. The 
challenge before Leghari is similar  to create a level playing field for 
everyone  but a challenge that will not be met easily with the Mumtaz 
Bhuttos and the Jamalis in the caretaker field.
    
Another thing to remember is that if Moeen Qureshis caretaker 
administration is supposed to have given a good account of itself, one 
reason for this was the simplicity of the baggage it carried. The aim 
before it was to hold clean elections, take urgently-needed measures to 
shore up the economy and, if possible, to address the problem of corruption 
in a general sort of way. It could concentrate on these tasks because it 
was neither driven by political prejudices nor distracted by the mirage of 
accountability.
 
President Legharis case is altogether different. He is not only expected 
to oversee the holding of clean elections. An articulate lobby is also 
expecting him to clean up the national stables by initiating a process of 
accountability. It is here that we come up against the second great 
contradiction in Article 58(2)b. Its use is justified only if the country 
is threatened with disorder or a government has been guilty of great evil. 
But once used in this manner, it arouses expectations of correction: that 
not only will the evil be lanced but the temple itself will be cleansed.
    
But three months  the constitutional deadline for holding elections  is 
not time enough for cleaning the temples of Babylon. These are competing 
imperatives which simply sow doubt and confusion in the public mind. If 
this is what is happening at the moment, it is scarcely being helped by the 
inarticulate noises coming from the presidency or from the pale shadows 
doing yeoman service in the caretaker government.

<a name="newb">New beginning or action replay?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Anis Alam

THE President has been pleased to dismiss the Benazir Bhutto- led PDF 
government, accusing it of rampant corruption and misgovernment. His action 
is a repeat of the then president Ghulam Ishaq Khans charges first against 
Benazir Bhutto in 1990 and against Nawaz Sharif in 1993.

In the eight years since parliamentary democracy was restored, three 
elected governments have been dismissed on charges of corruption and 
misgovernment. Both major parties, the PPP and the Muslim League, have been 
indicted. Innumerable cases of corruption against major functionaries of 
these governments are pending in courts.

With the latest dismissal new names will be added to those accused of 
corruption and misuse of power. What is, however, not clear is whether 
those accused of corruption and misgovernance will ever be made to pay for 
their deeds. In the last eight years, no-one has ever been convicted of the 
crimes that he has been charged with. One could rightly ask, what is new 
this time?

What is sad, however, is the fact that every time an elected government is 
dismissed, some people rejoice. PML(N) leaders and supporters celebrated 
the dismissal of the Benazir government. PPP leaders and their supporters 
were overjoyed at the dismissal of the earlier government of the PML(N).

Political opponents are hated with such vehemence that leaders are willing 
to destroy the very political system essential for their own political 
survival, in their desire to destroy their political opponents. This 
intolerance has now spread throughout Pakistani society, exacerbating 
sectarian, ethnic, tribal and denominational tensions.

The Presidents action has again demonstrated the fragility of the 
parliamentary democratic system in Pakistan. The extreme polarisation 
created during the long era of Zia-ul-Haq persists even today. The parties 
are unwilling to tolerate each other. There is a constant tussle to 
dethrone the party in power. This situation has enabled groups of the 
unprincipled elected representatives to blackmail every government in 
power. They change loyalties for personal favours in the shape of cash, 
plots, lucrative contracts, licences, loans and positions for their 
favourites.

Since 1985 these parliamentarians, emerging under the non- party system, 
have played havoc with the democratic set up and debased it in the eyes of 
the common people. Massive horse- trading takes place any time a government 
faces a vote of confidence. Parliamentarians are taken to Changa Manga, 
Saidu Sharif, Peshawar, Islamabad, etc., to isolate them from rival 
bidders. It is necessary that before election are held electoral reforms 
are enacted to debar people with such records in public office.

It is amazing to note that very little, if any, legislation has been 
discussed and enacted in the assemblies during the eight years since 
restoration of the parliamentary system. Universally criticised 
constitutional amendments and ordinances like the Eighth Amendment and the 
Hudood Ordinance enacted by a military dictator have not been removed 
because of lack of agreement among the main political parties. Most of the 
time governments have relied on the non-parliamentary practice of 
presidential ordinances that are hardly ever discussed in the assemblies 
and enacted again and again.

The main function of the assemblies is to legislate and discuss government 
policies and actions to ensure that they are legitimate and in the national 
interest. The assemblies have not functioned as they ought to have.

It is obvious that democracy in Pakistan has been reduced to election of 
parliamentarians. Once elected, a majority of them, especially those on the 
government side, tend to behave in the most dictatorial manner. They flout 
the laws of the land and demand, and usually get, privileges not due to 
them. They tend to use their position to enrich their kith and kin and 
themselves.

Both parties are weak on organisation. They have been organised from top 
downwards. There is no internal democracy in either of them. The PPP is 
Benazir, the PML is Mian Nawaz Sharif, the PML(J) is Hamid Nasir Chatta, 
the JUI is Maulana Fazlur Rahman or Maulana Samiullah, the JUP is Maulana 
Noorani or Maulana Abdul Sattar Niazi. These leaders nominate functionaries 
at the lower levels. At no time does the ordinary worker get a chance to 
elect his/her leader. The leaders are chosen for them by the supreme 
political leader. This keeps the political parties organisationally weak. 
Only at the time of agitation or election is the party machinery activated. 
At other times it lies dormant and dysfunctional. This is as true of the 
PPP as of this PML. If democracy has to take roots in Pakistan, political 
parties with well-defined programmes have to be organised from the 
grassroot level upwards.

Every government, whether representative or otherwise, only works for the 
benefit of its chosen group, be they industrialists, businessmen, trade 
groups, transporters, landowners, property developers, contractors or large 
landowners. Every government has favourites of its own. It is only the 
pressure of organised groups that forces governments to provide services to 
that group. In developing countries the political parties are usually weak. 
The only organised groups are the armed forces, propertied classes, 
industrialists and traders (chamber of commerce and industry), feudals, 
professionals and labour in large-scale industry. Working people, peasants, 
labourers, petty shopkeepers and peddlers are not organised. Hence their 
interest hardly ever gets prominence in the policies of the governments.

Governments the world over are now committed to development. Every 
government, whether democratically elected or otherwise, and every 
politician of some consequence, talks of eradicating poverty, disease, 
unemployment and ushering in an era of justice, peace and prosperity. It 
was not always like this. It is the present century which has demonstrated 
that with judicious and planned use of science and technology in the 
production processes, every country can be rich and prosperous. In the 
present century, one country after the other has risen from the ranks of a 
poor, backward agrarian society to become a prosperous industrial nation. 
Japan, China, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Brazil, Mexico, Greece, 
Italy, Spain and Portugal are just a few of the examples.

The World Bank Development Report for the year 1996 listed 51 countries as 
being low-income. These countries had a total population in excess of three 
billion and their average per capita gross national product (GNP) in 1994 
was put $380. In Pakistan the per capita GNP in 1994 was put at $430. 
However, a few of the low-income countries are also making giant strides 
along the road to prosperity. These are the so-called new tiger economies 
of Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia which have left the 
ranks of poor economies to join the ranks of middle and upper middle-income 
economies. China, a country of nearly 1,200 million people, has managed to 
increase the per capita GNP by a whooping rate of 7.8 per cent during the 
decade of 1985-94.

In Pakistan, however, this rate of growth was just 1.2 per cent. Even India 
managed a rate of 2.9, more than twice that of Pakistan. these countries 
have developed their human resources by investing heavily in education, 
health, and infrastructure and are now reaping the benefits in terms of 
very high growth rates. Pakistan remains one of the poorest among the poor 
countries. Our record in providing social services like education, health, 
safe water, immunisation, shelter, transport and communication is 
especially bad. Over two-thirds of the population are illiterate. Sixty per 
cent of the girls and forty per cent of the boys of primary school-going 
age remain without schools, nearly 80 per cent of boys and girls do not 
finish secondary school. Less than three per cent of the young reach post-
school educational institutions.

About 65 per cent of the population does not have access to safe drinking 
water, 70 per cent have no sanitation. The public transport system is 
either non-existent or has deteriorated over the years. In the villages 
hardly any social services exist. Most of the utilities like water, gas 
electricity and sanitation provided by the state are monopolised by the 
upper and middle- income groups. Most governments have not been responsive 
to the needs of the common people.

Dismissal of civilian governments has been frequent in Pakistans political 
history. These dismissals have been done some times by military dictators 
as in 1958, 1977 and 1988 but also by civilian heads of state as in 1990 
and 1993 and now in Nov. 1996. Every time these governments were accused of 
corruption and misgovernance. Why are civilian governments in Pakistan 
regularly dismissed, usually by authorities not directly elected by the 
people? To understand this, a little digression is needed. One has to 
understand the nature of state and its institutions in post-colonial 
countries like Pakistan.

A major source of tension is the fact that the state in post- colonial 
countries is not the creation of the indigenous social groups, the 
landowners, the merchants and the industrialists. It is a legacy of the 
colonial times. It was created by the colonial authority for the 
safeguarding and promotion of colonial interests. As colonialism is forced 
to retreat by movements for independence, the state with its institutions 
is inherited by the party leading the movement. Unless the movement was 
very strong with deep roots among the various social classes and people, 
the civil and military bureaucracy, instead of being subservient to the 
government, assumes an independent role. Making use of the subservient 
character of the landowners and merchant class during the colonial era, it 
starts to dominate and manipulate politicians coming from land-owning 
families.

Older, well-established nations evolved during a long time, during which 
dominant social groups created institutions to safeguard and promote their 
interests. The civil and military bureaucracy running state institutions is 
subservient to these groups. In countries like Pakistan the civil and 
military bureaucracy, instead of being subservient to the people, tries to 
lord it over them. Democracy does not suit them. hence attempts to bypass 
democratic rights and democratic rule. Elected governments are dismissed, 
giving way to direct or indirect rule by military.

Most post-colonial countries have thus been ruled by the military for long 
periods of time. In the absence of democracy and democratic institutions, 
brutal repression of less privileged nationalities, regions and smaller 
ethnic and religious group takes place. In the year 1988, 68 countries were 
being ruled by military. Violent conflicts often erupt.

People want a revolution which would bring peace and prosperity and restore 
their dignity as human beings, irrespective of their, cast, creed, colour. 
Post-colonial countries will, therefore, continue to be hotbeds of 
discontent till such time as they are able to provide justice, equity, 
dignity, and prosperity to all of their citizens.

The present tension and state of uncertainty in Pakistan have to be seen in 
the light of what has been discussed above. The only road that leads to a 
bright future and a place for us among civilised nations is the road of 
democracy. All political parties, social groups and interest groups should 
organise themselves for the defence of universally accepted human rights, 
rule of law, democratic values and democratic institutions.

Pakistan is beset with innumerable problems basically related to its 
underdevelopment. Our people are as industrious and ingenious as any in the 
world, our land as varied and rich as anywhere. But lack of vision and 
leadership from politicians allowed the civil and military, bureaucracies 
to assume a leadership role right from the early years of Pakistans 
independence. Their arbitrary, authoritarian rule has pushed Pakistan among 
the most underdeveloped of the nations of the world. Their attempts at 
nation building from the top have not only led to the dismemberment of the 
country but also to trebling the number of illiterates and the rise of 
ignorance, bigotry, sectarian and ethnic conflicts, inter-regional 
illiterates and the rise of ignorance, bigotry sectarian and ethnic 
conflicts, inter-regional and inter-provincial imbalances.

General Yahya Khans attempts at legitimacy led to the introduction of the 
so-called ideology of Pakistan by his fellow General, Sher Ali khan. 
Instead of cementing the people of Pakistan as one nation it led to civil 
war in the eastern wing and its eventual separation from Pakistan. General 
Zia-ul-Haqs search for legitimacy resulted in his policy of Islamisation 
that brought ethnic and sectarian conflicts to a pitch never witnessed 
before. Pakistanis stand more divided today than ever before. There are 
several well organised armed religious groups that openly declare their 
hatred of representative democracy.

A start can still be made to put the affairs of Pakistan on the right 
track. Let there be a national consensus on the following points:

1. Pakistan is for all the people of Pakistan. All Pakistanis, irrespective 
of race, colour, religion, sect, ethnicity, language and gender are equal 
citizens before law, all enjoying the same fundamental rights as enshrined 
in the United Nations Charter.

2. The development of Pakistan can only be possible through the development 
of its manpower potential. A massive programme for short as well as long-
term development in this respect should be launched.

3. The prosperity of the people and the country is possible only through 
the fullest development of the agriculture and industrial potential with 
maximum possible safeguards for the environment.

4. Pakistan is a developing country. It can develop only by drawing on the 
experiences of other countries that have become developed in the last 200 
years  France, Germany, the US, Japan, Korea and China among them. It is 
futile to try to chart any so-called Pakistani or Islamic course.

5. Pakistan is a poor country facing enormous problems; a galloping 
population growth, alarming concentration of wealth among a small minority 
leading to rising differences in well being among various sections of the 
population, and inter and intra-regional disparities. All this has raised 
the genie of obscurantism, sectarianism and ethnicity.

6. A realistic assessment of Pakistans position in the world ought to be 
made. Foreign policy adventures like that in Afghanistan ought to be 
shunned. Adventures in neighbouring regions as advocated by the likes of 
Qazi Hussain Ahmed should be firmly resisted. Undivided national attention 
should be paid to our own problems and their solutions.

Where brute force does not yield any solutions, wise diplomacy works 
wonders. Let us try to negotiate with India to reduce mutual security 
concerns and embark on a mutual reduction of arms and armies. We just 
cannot afford to spend all the government revenue income on defence, law 
and order and debt servicing, leaving the people without any social welfare 
services. After all, people must have something for whose defence they 
could be exhorted to sacrifice. In view of the fact that successive 
governments in Pakistan have spent insignificant percentages of revenue 
income on health education, social welfare of the people, it is no wonder 
that the average citizen sees government and its institutions only as 
oppressors and not as protectors. Politicians should come to an agreement 
among themselves to change this perception.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Viren Verma

SHARJAH, Nov 12: Pakistan, well known to make a mess of things, are equally 
an exciting side to watch when in full flow. On Tuesday, with their openers 
finally finding their usual delicate touch, they ruthlessly bruised the ego 
and pride of world champions, Sri Lanka, with a convincing eight-wicket 
victory in the Champions Trophy cricket tournament here.
    
With this glorious victory. Pakistan became the first team to book a place 
in the final. A surprisingly subdued Sri Lanka, who have rounded off their 
league engagements with three points from four matches, now await the 
outcome of tomorrows Pakistan versus New Zealand match. If New Zealand, 
who also have three points, win, its all and over for the Sri Lankans. But 
if they dont the run-rate will come into play, which is slightly tilted in 
favour of Sri Lanka.
    
On Tuesday Pakistan were simply impeccable in every department of the game. 
They bowled well, fielded excellently and batted with grace and conviction.
    
Saeed Anwar, who had scored an unbeaten 104 in Pakistans last match 
against New Zealand on Sunday, picked up from where he had left off. 
Striking the ball with authority, Anwar blasted a grand 112, again 
unbeaten, to post his second century in the tournament and 11th of his 
career, spanning 112 matches.

<a name="nzlo">N.Z. lose to Pakistan but sneak into Sharjah final</a>\
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Viren Varma

SHARJAH, Nov 13: How intriguing and ambiguous can interpretations of 
cricket rules be? One got a bitter taste of it during the last league match 
of the Singer Champions Trophy cricket tournament today.
    
The match between Pakistan and New Zealand, for a change, took the back 
stage and it all boiled down to which team - New Zealand or Sri Lanka - 
would qualify for the final...and how. Whether the net run-rate or the 
aggregate outcome of matches between the two teams in question - a new 
addition to the mind-blowing wordings of cricket rules - would decide the 
fate of the second finalist.
    
New Zealand finally sneaked into the final after a day-long drama and 
confusion over Rule 11.1. they will take on Pakistan, who topped the group 
by beating New Zealand by four wickets today with six points from our 
matches.
    
If New Zealand had won their last match there would have been no confusion, 
no problems, but their loss, threw open a debate over the standard playing 
conditions. With this defeat, New Zealand finished with three points from 
our matches, exactly the same as that of Sri Lanka. Since New Zealand had 
beaten Sri Lanka in a league match and tied the second, they earned the 
right to make it to the final despite an inferior net rates.
    
The confusion arose over the interpretation of Rule 11.1. Tournament 
referee Mike Smith, former England captain, contacted David Richards, the 
ICC Chief Executive, to seek his opinion. And it was decided during lunch 
time that the run-rate would come into play.
    
But the New Zealand team management was not satisfied. They contacted their 
board, who, in turn, sought further clarification from ICC. Richards then 
spoke to Ali Bacher of the South African Cricket Board, the architect of 
the rule, and the two finally decided that since New Zealand had performed 
better in the league stages against Sri Lanka, they would go through to the 
final.
    
The objective is to see which team performed better than the other, 
Richards said in a Press statement.
    
Unfortunately, the wording of the rule is ambiguous, as it refers to ... 
the winner of all of preliminary matches played between them... That, 
taken literally, could mean that the winner would be the winner of each and 
every match. Equally, the word `of can be taken to mean originating from 
(Oxford English Dictionary.), the statement said.
    
I have spoken to the South African cricket board and they have advised 
that the wording is the aggregate outcome of all matches played between the 
two teams. The exact workings of Rule 11.1 are: In the event of the teams 
finishing on equal points, the right to play in the final match or series 
will be decided by the most wins in the preliminary matches or, when teams 
have both equal wins and equal points, the team which was the winner of all 
of the preliminary match (as) (played between them) will be placed in the 
higher position or, if still equal, the higher net run rate in the 
preliminary matches. The Sri Lankan management later took things in the 
right spirit though Dhammika Ranatunga, Chief Executive of Sri Lankan 
Board, said the rule needs a bit of `tightening up.

The highlight of the match a superb six-wicket haul by Man-of-the-Match 
Waqar Younis and a 115-run stand between Adam Parore and Lee Germon which 
equalled the world record for the seventh wicket between Jeff Dujon (57 not 
out) and Malcolm Marshall (66) posted against Pakistan in Gujranwala on Nov 
4, 1986.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Walter Fernandez

KARACHI 12: Pakistan face off the Netherlands in the opener of the 18th 
Mens Champions Trophy World Hockey Tournament scheduled to be held at 
Madras (India) from Dec. 7 to 15.
 
Preparations continue in right earnest for the Champions Trophy Tournament 
organisation has been under the watchful eye of the International Hockey 
Federation (FIH), both from Brussels and in person. FIH Technical Manager 
Adrien Peters visited Madras in September to assess the tournaments 
progress on all counts.
 
Based on Mr. Peters report, the FIH affirmed the continuing organisation 
and approved the final match schedule, while still expressing concern about 
inadequacy of certain facilities. As the floodlighting will not be in place 
for the tournament, it was agreed that all matches would be played in 
daylight.
    
The tournament also marks the beginning of the FIHs official working 
relationship with API Television, the FIHs television distribution 
representatives. The London based company was awarded exclusive TV rights 
for a four-year period to a package of the FIH Tournaments, which they in 
turn sell and distribute.
 
The Champions Trophy is the first event covered under the contract. In one 
deal already negotiated, API TV have sold satellite rights for Asia and the 
Indian Sub-continent to ESPN Asia.
    
Within India, host broadcaster Doordarshan will be broadcasting all of the 
tournaments 18 matches live on national network as well as providing the 
feed for international distribution.
    
And on another television note, following its successful implementation 
during the Atlanta Olympic Games, the FIH is once again asking teams to 
adhere to a policy of `no white below knees during the Champions Trophy. 
This policy makes it easier for viewers, particularly those watching 
television, to follow the white ball.

ISLAMABAD, Nov 10: China extended its dominance at the 4th Asian Junior 
Rowing Championships by claiming a bulk of six gold medals, three each in 
mens and womens events, and one silver out of the eight finals here at 
the conclusion of the four-day regatta contested at Rawal Lake, Saturday.
 
Japan snatched two gold, a silver and a bronze, Korea secured three silver 
and two bronze medals, hosts Pakistan clinched three silver medals all in 
the mens category while Taiwan took a haul of four bronze. Uzbekistan also 
finished within the medal tally owing to its coxless pair crew which 
wrapped up third place.
 
The Minister for Education, Science and Technology, Syeda Abida Hussain, 
was the chief guest at the closing ceremony. Before distributing medals to 
the athletes she extended a special welcome to the participants from the 
great Asian nations and highly appreciated the number of women competitors 
in the event. Mumtaz Ali, President Pakistan Rowing Federation (PRF) 
admired the working to his team which made possible the harmonious manner 
in which the regatta was held.
 
China missed out on entering the final contest against all the eight gold 
medals at stake during the event, when its single sculler Gudlian Qin was 
not allowed to compete in the pre-finals on Saturday after he failed to 
provide his permanent ID card as an evidence about the age. Manager of the 
Chinese team Chen Chunxin, said member of Chinese Qins date of birth could 
not be checked although he claimed that the rower was under-18 years of 
age. I called back to reconfirm his age but since the boy lives several 
kilometres away from Beijing in the countryside it was not possible to 
provide the ID card before the finals here, Mr Chen said.
