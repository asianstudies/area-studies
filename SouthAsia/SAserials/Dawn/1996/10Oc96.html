SUKKUR, Oct 6: Federal Education Minister Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah has said 
that talks were going on with the opposition to work toward a unanimous 
bill on corruption in the light of the Presidents message and further 
added that progress was expected soon.
    
He said Rs. 91 billion had been plundered, and the politicians were being 
blamed for this massive looting of public money. He claimed that only five 
per cent politicians were involved in corruption.

wounded when attempting to rob an assistant sub- inspector of police on 
Saturday in Saddar police station limits.
    
Initial police reports said as Arif Osman, ASI of Bahadurabad police 
station, was in his car in mufti, near Masjid Romi roundabout on Sharea

injured after bullets hit him in the chest and in a leg. He was taken to 
JPMC where he was identified from his ID card as constable Aijaz Ahmed, 
posted in Gizri police station. He died in the hospital later on.

<a name="worl">World Bank lists Pakistan among corrupt countries</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Oct 4: The World Bank has listed Pakistan among the three most 
corrupt borrowing countries and has ordered surprise raids by special 
squads to audit projects funded by the Bank in these countries.
    
"Pakistan has recently been added to the list which consisted of Kenya and 
Poland and Bank President James Wolfensohn has hired the independent Swiss 
accounting firm Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) to carry out the 
audit raids," Bank officials said.
    
The new audit squads will hit countries comprising a World Bank portfolio 
of at least one billion dollars, and 20 on-going projects in these three 
countries have been targeted, including the Hub power project in Pakistan.
    
Mr Wolfensohn, who called on Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto at New York on 
Thursday after the cancellation of his visit to Pakistan during his 
forthcoming South Asian tour, ordered creation of special squads after he 
learned that "billions of dollars were being lost through corruption and 
negligent or non-existent supervision of projects".
    
The Bank decision to put Pakistan on the hit list came after Transparency 
International, the Berlin-based firm, recently rated Pakistan as the second 
most corrupt country in the world after Nigeria. The World Bank is said to 
have taken special note of the rating.

<a name="auth">Author was denied $15m, claims Shaikh</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

NEW YORK, Oct 3: A Wall Street Journal op-ed piece, which makes a strong 
case against any foreign investment, including funding by the International 
Monetary Fund, World Bank, and aid packages to Pakistan, was described as 
being "infantile, vindictive and without any credibility" by Foreign 
Secretary Najmuddin Shaikh.
    
At a Press briefing on Wednesday night, Mr. Shaikh observed that the 
article, written on the eve of the most delicate talks with the 
International Monetary Fund, was due to a "pique" that the writer, Mr. 
Mansoor Ijaz, had against Pakistan government since he could not "derive 
sufficient benefit" from projects he had given which were rejected by the 
government.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Pakistan Embassy in Washington told "Dawn" 
on Wednesday night that Mr Ijaz, who is chairman of the New York-based 
Crescent Investment Management, is vilifying and damaging Pakistan, because 
the embassy denied him 15 million dollars he had demanded to deliver votes 
in the United States House of Representatives for the passage of the Brown 
Amendment.
    
The spokesman said that in 1995, after the Brown Amendment had made it 
through the US senate and then had to be voted on by the House, Mr. Ijaz 
came to the embassy along with his lawyers with a proposal which smacked of 
a "sting operation".
    
Elaborating on Mr Ijaz's proposal, the spokesman said "Mr Ijaz wanted us to 
release fifteen million dollars for a satellite communications company 
R.D.D.A. which had done some work for Pakistan in 1979 for which they were 
not paid and they would sue the government to recover the monies".
    
"Ijaz told us that in this way you will kill two birds with one stone, one 
we will ensure votes in the US House for the Brown Amendment and the other 
the company R.D.D.A. will not sue you", the spokesman added.
    
The spokesman said that when Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi was given this 
proposal she saw it as a trap wherein Pakistan Government could land in 
bigger trouble; so she turned down Mr Mansoor Ijaz's proposal saying that 
"it was illegal".
    
In the Wall Street Journal article, Mr Ijaz has implied that Ambassador 
Lodhi used "aggressive tactics" in pushing for F-16 monies after the 
passage of the Brown Amendment because her brother, Amir Lodhi, was 
interested in the Mirage deal with France as he was the middleman as 
alleged in the article.
    
Describing the article by Mr Ijaz as being 'outrageous and malicious 
against Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States, and saying "this is a 
total travesty of facts", the Pakistan Embassy in a Press release pointed 
out "Pakistan's publicly enunciated policy on the embargoed military 
equipment has been the consistent demand for the release of this equipment 
or the full reimbursement of the money paid".
    
"It was the US Administration which took a decision in July 1995 to back 
legislation authorising the release of the military equipment except the F-
16s, for which the Administration pledged to return the money. 
   
This was not Pakistan's decision but that of the US Administration and 
Congress", the Press release said.
    
"Insinuations to the contrary make the preposterous assumption that 
Pakistan's Ambassador was in a position not only to determine the policy of 
the US Administration but also the decision of the US Congress on the F-16 
issue".
    
As regards Mr Ijaz, it was pointed out that he had been pushing Pakistan 
government to recognise Israel and he has himself visited Israel on several 
occasions, once on the invitation of Jerusalem's Mayor.
    
Last year, Mr. Ijaz was given an award by a major Jewish organisation as 
being the "Humanitarian of the year" for establishing clinics and schools 
in Belgium and parts of Eastern Europe for the Jewish communities there. 
Ambassador Ahmad Kamal, who attended the award ceremony, praised Mr Ijaz 
and his "philanthropist activities". Then in his speech Mr Ijaz thanked 
Ambassador Kamal's wife saying "thank you Mrs Kamal for Dal, Roti and 
Kabab".
    
When the Foreign Secretary was told about the incident he said, "We all 
make mistakes".

<a name="cuti">Cut in defence budget ruled out</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Oct 9: A special cabinet meeting will be held here on Thursday 
to consider a four-point proposal concerning the proposed IMF package of 
reforms. The four points are: cuts in current expenditure; review and 
reform of general sales tax; imposition of agricultural tax; and bank 
reform.
    
The government is seriously considering accepting all the new 
conditionalities of the IMF, except the one concerning reduction in defence 
budget.
    
However, a gradual and creeping reduction in the countrys military budget, 
to the tune of 30 per cent, starting from the next year, is not being ruled 
out.
    
In their discussions with the government, the defence authorities are said 
to have pointed out that while they understood the financial predicament in 
which the country was finding itself currently, they felt it would not be 
advisable to touch the defence budget at this juncture to bail out the 
economy.
    
They, however, are to said to have extended full support to the government 
in its efforts to increase revenues by taxing the incomes from agriculture.

<a name="paki">Pakistan to continue its N-policy, says Leghari</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, Oct 9: President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari said here on Wednesday 
that Pakistan was against the production of nuclear weapons but cannot 
neglect the nuclear option which, by and large, provides an effective 
answer to many of its needs.
    
Addressing the silver jubilee celebrations of the 137mw Karachi Nuclear 
Power Plant (KANUPP)  the only in Pakistan and the Muslim world  the 
president declared in unequivocal terms that Pakistan would continue with 
its right to acquire and excel in nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.
    
It was unfortunate that Pakistan was being hindered by some powers in 
acquiring this technology even for peaceful purposes, and pressure was 
being exerted to disband the nuclear programme, the president said.
    
Referring to Pakistans positive approach to nuclear non- proliferation and 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, President Leghari said that CTBT should 
be applicable to all, an implied reference to Indias refusal to sign the 
treaty or the General Assemblys resolution in this regard.
    
Emphasising that an energy-resource deficient country in terms of fossil 
fuel reserves, Pakistan needs to make large-scale use of nuclear power to 
meet its future energy requirements.

Bureau Report
    
ISLAMABAD, Oct 6: The Pakistan Bar Council, apex body of legal 
practitioners, has expressed deep concern over killings by intelligence 
agencies and the police.
    
In a resolution passed at its meeting here on Thursday but released on 
Sunday , the council said: Fake police encounters have become a rule of 
the day.
    
The PBC said that by giving a free hand to the police and agencies, the 
federal government had made Pakistan a police state. The PBC noted that 
gross violations of human rights and fundamental rights were taking place 
and these cases should be brought to the notice of the Supreme Court for an 
immediate remedial action under article 184(3) of the constitution.

<a name="chin">China sold nuclear furnace to Pakistan, says US newspaper</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Oct 9: China has once again sold a nuclear-related equipment to 
Pakistan, this time a special skull-shaped industrial dual-use furnace, in 
violation of a pledge to the US, the Washington Times  said on Wednesday 
quoting a top secret CIA memorandum.
    
A banner headlined first lead story written by the papers defence 
correspondent Bill Gertz said the State Department had sent a diplomatic 
note to Beijing protesting the latest sale of the furnace and some high-
tech diagnostic equipment with military applications.
    
The CIA memo reportedly said this time the sale had been approved by the 
Chinese leadership and Chinese technicians were already in Pakistan 
preparing to install the furnace which was delivered early in September.
    
The paper said the State Department spokesman Nick Burns and senior CIA 
officials had declined to comment on the story but a Pakistan Embassy 
spokesman had denied that his country received any illegal shipment of 
nuclear technology from China. A Chinese embassy spokesman called the 
report groundless and irresponsible.

By Athar Ali

LONDON, Oct 4: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said that if Afghanistan 
can now be unified it would be a welcome development for the whole world as 
it would have a government to deal with.
    
She was answering questions for a British television news programme, 
following the capture of Kabul by the Taliban. Ms Bhutto added that the 
unification of Afghanistan would be a welcome development because the 
country was a gateway to Central Asia, and unless there was peace in 
Afghanistan Central Asian republics could never be truly independent.
    
Those who also took part in the programme were former Pakistan army chief 
of staff Gen. Aslam Beg , and the former Pakistan foreign secretary, 
Shaharyar M. Khan. The risks to which the Taliban victory exposed Pakistan 
were emphasised by Mr Khan who said that their fanatical attitude towards 
Islam might well have an impact on Pakistan . He pointed to the sway of 
opinion, especially of the people in the north, who believed in such an 
attitude. He said it was now for the moderate and the centrist Pakistanis 
to stand up and say whether they want this kind of Islam.
    
Gen Beg confirmed Pakistan's links with the Taliban and said their bases 
were in Pakistan because all their madrasas were there.
    
However, Ms Bhutto denied that Pakistan alone had a hand in the creation of 
this new force which had now taken over Kabul, for which Islamabad was 
being held responsible. She said Britain, the United States, Saudi Arabia 
and Pakistan, during the Jihad, had set up Taliban schools and made them 
self-financing. They all must share the blame if the Taliban did something, 
she added.

<a name="kseo">KSE opens on Friday after 19 years </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 3: After about two decades, the Karachi Stock Exchange will 
resume trading on Friday and analysts said the investors' optimism 
suggested that the welcome could be spontaneous in the maiden session.
    
The board of directors of the Lahore and Islamabad stock exchanges have 
also decided to observe Sunday as closed holiday and will open on Fridays 
from Oct 4.
    
However, the other major local markets including the cotton, commodity and 
bullion markets will continue to close business on Fridays at least for the 
next couple of weeks but are expected to follow the lead provided by the 
KSE.
    
The first Friday trading session on Oct 4 at the KSE could be eventful as 
investors are inclined to make it an outstanding success apparently in a 
bid to seek the central bank's approval for opening of the bank branches, a 
floor broker said adding "funds have been lined up to give the short 
session trading a respectable look".
    
"We have provided the missing link to foreign investors after opting for 
Friday as a working day", claimed a leading member of the Karachi Stock 
Exchange adding "after the internationalisation of the KSE through the 
Reuter cable network it was long overdue".

<a name="reve">KSE reverts to Friday as holiday</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
KARACHI, Oct 9: The Board of Directors of the Karachi Stock Exchange again 
decided on Wednesday to observe Friday as closed holiday, reversing its 
last weeks decision to switch over to Sunday , apparently to defuse 
tension caused by a campaign launched by some religious parties against 
this change.
    
Sunday will again be a full working day and Friday a closed holiday for 
the stock traders, said a member of the KSE.
    
There was no official word from the bosses of Lahore and Islamabad stock 
exchanges but they would follow their apex body, dealers said.
    
Although there were some dissenting voices about the snap reversal and 
that, too, on some external pressure, a general body meeting of the KSE , 
which met here on Wednesday, decided to respond to the call of some 
prominent religious parties to maintain the sanctity of Friday.
    
The Board of Directors of the Karachi Stock Exchange had decided on Oct 1 
last to declare Friday a working day from Oct 4, in response to Federation 
of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industrys call and to express 
solidarity with the business community.
    
Though the decision was bold , it seemed to have been taken a bit hastily, 
without taking into account the objective political conditions and the 
great divide between the contenders of power, said a member of the KSE.  
But some others said the decision was not final and might be reviewed after 
a month.

<a name="peac">Peace in Afghanistan to open a vital trade route</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

The dramatic developments that have occurred across Durand Line in recent 
weeks augur well for Pakistan's economy in more than one way.
    
With the Kabul government falling to forces committed to bringing the eight 
year long fractional war to an end and rising hopes in the wake, of 
restoration of peace in a country that had remained in the grip of bloody 
turmoil for more than 16 years, it is anticipated that two-way trade 
between Pakistan and Afghanistan will soon be normalised and formalised.
    
Secondly, the transit trade which has over the years degenerated into a 
vehicle of smuggling, especially after the Afghan war, is expected to come 
under the discipline of international law impinging on such trade between 
two neighbouring countries once normalcy returns to Pakistan's land-locked 
northern neighbour.
    
Thirdly and more importantly, the trade routes between Pakistan and the 
resource-rich central Asian countries which pass through Afghanistan would 
hopefully become, as a result, secure from brigands of disparate warlords 
desperately looking for money and provisions to sustain their bloody 
misadventures.
    
War-ravaged Afghanistan produces next to nothing today and has become 
totally dependent on supplies from neighbouring countries, mostly Pakistan. 
Because the Iran-Afghanistan border is not as porous as that of Pakistan- 
Afghanistan.
    
In recent years Pakistan has suffered continuously from food shortages 
because of unchecked smuggling of these items across the Afghan border. 
This has had two unwelcome effects on Pakistan's economy. Shortages push up 
prices of food items domestically causing the rate of inflation to shoot 
up, which in turn affects the rupee exchange rate.
    
Secondly, the country is forced to import food items to overcome domestic 
shortages which in its wake causes the import bill to get out of control 
widening the trade gap which again impacts adversely on the rate of 
exchange. As a result of these two-prong negative pressures on the rupee, 
the Pak currency has been taking a tumble on a daily basis for a long time 
now.
    
This situation could be overcome more than adequately, if Pakistani 
producers of food items and manufactures, especially those in NWFP and on 
Punjab-NWFP border were to build up their inventories, keeping in view the 
20 million strong market of Afghanistan but not before establishing firm 
links with legitimate import houses in Afghanistan.
    
Today Afghanistan is not in a position to match its imports from Pakistan 
with exports to this country, and neither does it earn enough hard currency 
from any other sources to pay for these imports, it would be advisable if 
Pakistan were to agree to allow the two-way trade in local currencies 
(Afghans and rupees).
    
The Afghan transit trade has assumed the proportion of almost a menace for 
Pakistan's economy. The smuggling which it facilitates not only robs the 
government of its revenue, but it also impacts adversely on Pakistan's 
manufacturing sector by promoting dumping of high quality competitive items 
in Pakistani markets.
    
Pakistan can tackle the issue by entering into an agreement with a 
legitimate government in Kabul to lift all economic barriers between the 
two countries and let all imports meant for Afghanistan from beyond 
Pakistan carry import duties at the same rates as charged for goods meant 
for Pakistan (very soon the difference would become very negligible as 
Pakistan is obliged under the WTO agreement to drastically slash its import 
tariffs). These duties should be collected by Pakistan customs and then 
passed on to the Afghan government after these goods enter Afghanistan.
    
In a way, what is being proposed here is a gradual integration of the 
economies of the two countries, one of which is land-locked, for mutual 
benefit. There is nothing wrong in doing so, because already Pakistan is 
engaged in similar exercises in SAARC on the one hand and in ECO on the 
other which also includes Afghanistan.
    
Being an economically better-off neighbour, Pakistan could also negotiate 
with the Afghan government a transit fee to be payable in hard currency by 
Islamabad to Kabul for the movement of goods to and from Central Asian 
countries and Pakistan through Afghanistan. Traders from Central Asian 
countries who wish to use the Afghan/Pakistan trade routes to trade with 
countries beyond Pakistan could also be invited to enter into such 
negotiations with Afghanistan and Pakistan separately.
    
Pakistani businessmen could also probe the possibilities of setting up 
joint ventures having clear comparative advantages in Afghanistan in 
collaboration with Afghan nationals as well as other Central Asian 
entrepreneurs keeping in mind the expanding markets of ECO and beyond.
    
Peace in Afghanistan has become the key to prosperity of the entire region. 
It is, therefore, imperative that any attempt by any force to bring 
normalcy and restore peace in the country should not only be welcomed but 
actively supported by all countries whose vested economic interests are 
linked to this peace.
    
It would be too naive at this juncture to predict the future of the Taliban 
government in Kabul. But the way this faction has speedily taken control of 
the entire country and rendered all other factions, as of today, either 
totally irrelevant or of no consequence, makes them the new force with 
which Pakistan will have to deal with in the immediate future. 
    
Therefore, Islamabad should take full care not to put a wrong foot forward 
at this juncture.
    
The Rabbani faction which had ruled the country immediately after and since 
Najib was ousted had shown on a number of occasions through its deeds and 
utterances that it had misgivings about the intentions of Islamabad. It 
would be a waste of time to debate at this juncture how right or wrong the 
Rabbani faction was.
    
What should not be forgotten is the fact that during Rabbani's tenure, a 
schoolbus carrying Pakistani children was hijacked by a group of Afghans 
soon after Islamabad sealed off the borders to reduce smuggling through the 
vehicle of transit trade. Next, the Pakistani embassy was ransacked by 
Afghans in Kabul seriously injuring the Pakistani ambassador and some high 
officials.
    
No transit trade of significance between Pakistan and Central Asian states 
was allowed by the Kabul government during this period. In fact, a number 
of trade caravans were looted by bandits backed by warlords. And finally, 
the skies over Afghanistan were not considered safe for flying Pakistani 
aircraft as long as Rabbani was ruling the roost in Kabul.

<a name="mood">Moody's poor rating to increase cost of borrowing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem
    
MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE, one of world's most influential credit rating 
agency, has informed the Government of Pakistan (GOP) that the country's 
long-term credit rating for foreign currency that currently stands at B-1 
would be reviewed, with a distinct possibility of a downgrade.
    
Moody's review process may stretch over a couple of months, but the mere 
fact that a country's debt is being reviewed (with the possibility of a 
downgrade) shall scare away investors, raise the cost of GOP borrowing from 
the international market, and depress the price of both the $150 million 
Euro-bonds and the $140 million floating rate notes (FRN). Responding to 
Moody's move, the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) also lost an additional 0.28 
per cent of its value.
    
Moody's began rating credit in 1909 and has since developed a complex, 
highly credible "system of gradation by which the relative investment 
qualities of bonds" are measured. Institutional investors around the world 
have, over the years, become dependent on how a corporation or a country is 
rated and Moody's opinion is often treated as the last word on credit-
worthiness.
    
The credit rating agency maintains that a "rating change should serve 
notice that the Moody's observes some alteration in the investment risks of 
the bond or that the previous rating did not fully reflect the quality of 
bond as now seen".
    
To be sure, our current rating is nothing to be proud of either. According 
to Moody's Bond Record Manual, 1994: "Bonds which are rated B generally 
lack the characteristics of the desirable investment. Assurance of interest 
and principal payments or of maintenance of other terms of the contract 
over any long period of time may be small". Technically, GOP-guaranteed 
bonds already fall into the non-investment grade category which are 
sometimes referred to as "junk bonds".
    
A survey of Moody's 1994 publication reveals that Pakistan's rating is 
almost at the very bottom of the pool of countries regularly rated by the 
agency. Besides Argentina which was rated B1, Indonesia (Baa3), Korea (A1), 
Malaysia (A2), Mexico (Ba2), the Philippines (Ba3), Turkey (Ba1) and 
Thailand (S&P, A-) were all, way above Pakistan.
    
The agency at times also allocates a numerical modifier to its generic 
rating classifications of Aaa to C. "The modifier '1' indicates that the 
company ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the 
modifier '2' indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier '3' indicates 
that the company ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category".

Cold war's end
 
In the pre-Cold War days when the two superpowers were always on the look-
out for creating their own areas of influence, strategically located 
countries (like Pakistan) were always provided meat to chew on by either of 
the competing powers. In the post-Cold War era, there has already been a 
serious reduction in the pool of donor money and donor-dependent countries 
are now required to become more market-oriented.
    
International markets run on pure economics and international providers of 
investment capital base their investment decisions on ratings. In the 
international capital arena, rating is to a country what water is to fish. 
Even under normal circumstances, the possibility of a negative change in 
credit rating by an internationally recognised credit rating agency is a 
difficult pill to swallow.
    
It will be specially tough on Pakistan where the economy is under attack 
from all directions. The IMF has already withheld its tranches under the 
stand-by agreement, there is repetitive devaluation, depletion of foreign 
exchange reserves, a massive trade deficit, a banking crisis and a general 
crisis of confidence in the economy. While the once readily available donor 
money gradually dries up, our economy would find it difficult to strive 
without accessing the international capital market.

It is expected that between now and the year 2000, our economy shall need 
an accumulated foreign resource inflow of more than $15 billion. 
   
It is not that a lower rating shall halt all foreign investment, but that 
the cost of attracting investment would sharply go up while a whole class 
of foreign investors would turn their backs on GOP debt (a large number of 
Foreign Institutional Investors are barred from investing into poorly rated 
debt). 
   
Debt servicing has already become the single largest expenditure item and 
any addition to that burden shall simply break the back of the beleaguered 
economy.
    
In the energy sector, for example, we have previously been able to attract 
foreign utility investors by guaranteeing an 18 per cent rate of return 
while a rating downgrade would force us to offer even higher rates of 
return for attracting any future investment making the already expensive 
power beyond the reach of consumers.
    
The First Floating Rate Note (FRN) that was offered for subscription in 
June had to guarantee 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent over and above the 
comparable treasury while the government shall be forced to offer even 
higher rates for the contemplated $100 million second FRN. 
   
The multi-million dollar financing of PTC receivables, however, not 
directly related to the rating of sovereign debt, has also been delayed by 
Citibank for unexplained complications.
    
To be certain, all is not lost yet on the rating front. The rating review 
process has been initiated on the basis of increased political instability, 
higher levels of short term debt and the deepening of economic uncertainty.
    
The IMF, on the other hand, is expected to make a crucial decision shortly.
    
If the stand-by agreement is put back on track or a new short term lending 
support commitment is agreed upon, Moody's Investors Service may, after 
all, decide on maintaining its current rating. We can, for the time being 
at least, manage without IMF's money but a nod of approval is what is 
needed to pacify the shrieking rating agencies and calm cautious, watchful 
investors. The IMF has been supportive in the past and, in all likelihood, 
Michael Camdessus can once again be persuaded to offer a helping hand just 
when the incumbent government needs it the most.
    
It must, however, be understood that we cannot live without foreign capital 
inflows. Continued expectations from donors shall not bear much fruit and 
we must eventually compete for scarce capital on the basis of ratings. 
   
As our rating goes down, our cost goes up. But, we have already exhausted 
our allocated quota of sins and another cost increase may mean an end to 
the economic life that we have become accustomed to.

<a name="priv">Private foreign investment in Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Israr-ul-Haque

PRIME MINISTER Bhutto has been resting on her laurels with all that about 
attracting record foreign investment, signifying the vigour and vitality of 
the national economy during her regime.
    
In presenting the Federal Budget for fiscal 1996-97 the Finance Minister of 
State too staked the claim of the regime's "unprecedented economic success" 
on the same grounds, namely attracting record foreign private investment. 
Thus waxed eloquent the Finance Minister:
    
"By the grace of Allah, we have attracted $3 billion in foreign private 
investment in three years. Compare that to 2 billion dollars foreign 
investment over the last 20 years. Foreign investment does not come without 
social infrastructure" 
    
And, finally he ended upon an exhilarating note of achievement:
    
"The foreign investment is predicated on a sound fiscal management which 
enjoys the confidence of international finance institutions, including the 
IMF and the World Bank, on political stability in the country and our 
ability to project and promote Pakistan as an ideal place of investment".
    
According to Mr. M.I.Lashkar, in the News of June 21 '96, it is evident 
that the gap of Rs 100 billion between the revenue and expenditure is going 
to be met out of development aid of Rs 102 billion. The development aid 
will comprise project aid of Rs 42 billion, community aid of Rs 4.2 
billion, fund aid of Rs.13.7 billion and short-term borrowing of Rs. 42.1 
billion.
    
Of late, a wave of foreign investment has been sweeping across the 
developing countries. Studies made by the UN for its World Investment 
Report show that there has been an upsurge of foreign investment into the 
developing countries as the industrially developed countries have become 
less and less attractive for massive investments. While 17 per cent of the 
Foreign Direct Investment (F.D.I.) went to the developing countries in 
1986-1991, the percentage spiralled up to 32 per cent in 1992 and it has 
since continued to surge forward. The World Bank has estimated that the 
flow of FDI into the developing countries shot up from $45 billion in 1989 
to a whooping $170 billion in 1994 in response to the unification of 
markets across the world. According to estimates transitional corporations 
now Control one-third of the World's private sector productive assets. The 
US and UK are the biggest owners, followed by Japan. Japan dominates in 
Asia, the United States in Latin American and the European Community 
countries, and Eastern European and Africa.
    
It is the cheap labour and the locational advantage that has proved a 
catalyst in triggering off the upsurge of foreign investment into the 
developing countries. The German worker earns as much in four hours as his 
Vietnamese counterpart does in a month or the Indian counterpart in 20 
days. Many companies in Hong Kong, in order to escape coming under the 
sovereignty of China, have been planning to relocate themselves in Manila 
or elsewhere. 
   
During recent years when the yen has been constantly rising in value, 
rendering Japanese exports less competitive, Japanese companies, in order 
to stay competitive, have been sourcing more and more of their components 
as well as their entire products from affiliates in other countries.
    
In view of Pakistan being strategically located at the month of the Gulf, 
commanding easy access to the Middle East and Central Asia, with an 
abundance of manpower of which a good portion is trained and skilled, has, 
in its own right become a centre of attraction for foreign investment, and 
the Government instead of adding any feather to its cap, seems to have 
failed to fully exploit these highly favourable conditions.
    
The $20 billion MOUs signed by Pakistan in 1994 is nothing more than so 
many declarations of intent. As against this, New Delhi has approved a 
total of 4,063 projects financed by foreign investors between 1991 and 
November, 1995, amounting to $17.5 billion.
The much-vaunted MOUs
    
Even these much-trumpeted American M.O.Us of $20 billion have since bogged 
down in the administrative, economic and financial quagmire of the present 
regime. The US Ambassador, Mr Thomas Simons, the other day observed 
publicly that the law and order situation in Karachi had adversely affected 
the projects of foreign investments. His observations.
    
"Karachi remained the centre of investment. Major American companies were 
keen to invest here and elsewhere. However, the disturbed situation has 
held them up from bringing capital. the M.O.Us between American and 
Pakistan to the tune of 20 billion dollars has suffered from the lethargy 
and paralysis that could easily be avoided."
    
Subsequently, while speaking at a function arranged by the Rotary Club at 
Islamabad, he complained of the multiplicity of the Government agencies 
dealing with the foreign investors and the lack of transparency in 
processing cases of foreign investment. He also cited a case where one 
foreign investor was asked out of the way to contribute to the development 
of canal system.

IMF's coercion

The M.O.Us have been further stalled because of the IMF conditionalities. 
The Chairman, Board of Investment, Syed Mohibullah Shah, gave out the other 
day that the Special Industrial Zone programme which has been the main 
attraction for foreign investment had received a serious setback as the 
incentive package consisting of tax exemptions has been withdrawn under the 
pressure from the IMF and the attempt to persuade the IMF to let the 
Government revive the incentive package had not succeeded so far.
    
The Government of Pakistan has recently signed a number of M.O.Us with 
America and other investors of the world of which the Enron Thermal Power 
Station is going to be set up at Multan designed to generate 754 M.W. at 
the cost of $670 million with the guaranteed sale of the entire power 
generated by it at 6.5 cents (or more) by WAPDA with a contact of thirty 
years. The other one is the Power House that is going to be constructed at 
Keti Bunder by the Electric Power Asia (CEPA) a leading Hong Kong Company. 
It would be a coal fired, generating 600 M.W. at the first stage and would 
carry a guarantee by the Government of Pakistan of 18 per cent return on 
its capital invested. It would be a gigantic $8 billion US project which 
would also include exploration and exploitation of the coal reserve in the 
Thar area in Sindh.
    
The main feature of private enterprise is to bear risks and take initiative 
and the profit that it earns is the reward for its risk bearing and 
initiative taking.
    
Both the crucial traits of private enterprise are conspicuous by their 
absence in both these foreign ventures. These ventures have been guaranteed 
the sale of their entire power generation at 6.5 cents (or more) per unit. 
WAPDA will not only be under contractual obligation to buy up the entire 
power generated but would also be required to take on the entire cost of 
transmission and distribution, in addition to bearing the losses and thefts 
in course of transmission and distribution.
    
The cost of power to agricultural, industrial, and domestic consumers would 
be prohibitive pushing up the cost of living as well as the cost of 
industrial and agricultural production. 
   
As the payment will have to be made in dollars the rupee cost would keep on 
mounting as the lather would be sliding against dollar. In her briefing to 
the Press on June 16, 1996, the Prime Minister conceded that government was 
worried over the fact that it had to pay $4.5 billion annually for the 
private power in the shape of the price of power produced in the private 
sector and the price of the furnace oil. whereas its total foreign private 
investment that the country has attracted during the last three years 
amounts to only 3 billion dollars as against that it has created a net 
payment liability of $4.5 billion annually. 
   
The bankruptcy of economic policy could go no further. In addition, US 
investors, under the terms of the contract, would be able to import 
equipments and machinery free of duty, the power generation would 
therefore be highly capital-intensive resulting in labour displacement from 
the power sector.
    
In the case of the CEPA Power House Project a return of 18 per cent on the 
capital invested has been guaranteed. WAPDA, inspite of frequent increases 
and progressive rates of its charges and surcharges, has not been able to 
break even and is incurring huge losses amounting to billions of rupees per 
annum. 
   
There is hardly any venture in public sector in Pakistan which has been 
consistently earning a return of 18 per cent on its capital investments. To 
the cost of the generation of power the cost of transmission, distribution 
and losses in transit will have to be added rendering the cost of the power 
delivery to the power consumers simply prohibitive. 
   
The coal that this Power House near Keti Bunder would be using would be 
imported and not the coal from the Thar area as originally envisaged at the 
time of signing the MOUs in October 1994.
    
Why not take up the Kalabagh multi-purpose hydel project which is designed 
to produce 3,600 MW of power and irrigate 2 to 3 million acres of land 
where the cost of per unit of power would be much lower and the return to 
the investment would be much higher.
    
It is reported that the Enron Contract for investment in power generation 
in India had to be terminated having been found to be too costly and Enron 
had to sign a revised contract with substantial reduction in the cost. 
Similarly, it is reported that Gordon Woo ventures in China proved a flop. 
   
It remains to be explained why the Government of Pakistan should have 
rushed to sign such highly non-competitive, rather monopolistic M.O.Us with 
foreign investors. "Data from the United States Commerce Department reveal 
that the United States multinationals keep their highest wage jobs and 
critical Research and Development operations in the US itself. Of the 4.8 
trillion US dollars in sales garnered by US multinationals in 1991, parent 
companies were responsible for 68 per cent largely because value-added 
products were either produced or packed and sold from US territory.

<a name="moda">Modaraba committee to conclude findings</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim
    
KARACHI, Oct 6: The joint scrutiny committee on modarabas will meet next 
week here to review the progress on its findings against 17 poor-performing 
modarabas and suggest measures to steer out the sector from the crisis.

Headed by a member of Corporate Law Authority Mr Abdul Rahman Qureshi, the 
committee is made up of representatives from State Bank of Pakistan, 
Karachi Stock Exchange and Modarabas Association of Pakistan. Though its 
primary objective is to ascertain the reasons for poor performance of some 
selected modarabas, the committee can suggest steps to help out the entire 
modaraba sector.
    
The committee has already received the inspection report on one of the 17 
modarabas under scrutiny and that of another one may be ready any time.
    
We would discuss at the next meeting the inspection report on one of 
modarabas under scrutiny, said a member of the committee who refused to be 
identified. He added that a similar report on another modaraba was being 
finalised.
    
He said the committee might call for inspection reports on a few more 
modarabas after the meeting.
    
The committee that was set up in May this year to study the working of 
modarabas has already held several sessions to examine the affairs of 17 
selected modarabas whose financial position has long been on the decline.
    
It is assigned to ascertain whether the declining performance of these 
modarabas is because of wilful negligence or due to gross incompetence.

The performance of the modaraba sector has fallen to the extent that more 
than 90 % of them are unable to fetch even the face value of their shares.
    
Modaraba managers link this situation largely to over-regulations and 
unfavourable policies.

<a name="petr">Petroleum prices raised again</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar R. Qureshi

ISLAMABAD, Oct 7: A little over six weeks after the last increase, the 
federal government on Monday again raised prices of petroleum products.    
A spokesman for the ministry of petroleum said that the   prices of 
petroleum products have been increased due to price rise in international 
market.
    
According to the announcement Motor Gasoline (regular)   which was selling 
at Rs 15.42 (minus) octroi will now be available at Rs 15.85. Motor 
Gasoline (super) which was available at Rs 16.48 will now be selling at 
16.95.

The prices of petroleum products were last increased on August 20 when the 
government increased the rates of super grade petrol by 24 paisa per litre 
and regular grade petrol by 40 per litre.
    
Before this, prices of petroleum products were actually decreased. On July 
22, prices of regular grade petrol were lowered by 15 paisa and those of 
super grade petrol by around 9 paisa. Earlier the government had decreased 
prices on June 12, decreasing the price of super  by around twenty paisa 
and that of regular grade petrol by 22 paisa.
    
However, the end result of these two decreases and two increases is that 
the price of regular grade petrol is now 51 paisa more expensive than what 
it was before the government initiated the first of the two price decreases 
on June 12. Similarly, the price of super petrol now is a little over 43 
paisa higher than that of June 12 decrease.

<a name="usda">USDA predicts 9.53m bales of cotton output</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Oct 7: The output of cotton crop is likely to be 9.53 million 
bales during 1996-97, according to the estimate of the US Department of 
Agriculture.
    
This is one per cent more than the last years production estimate, 
although at world level, the cotton yield is shown to have dropped by two 
per cent by  the USDA bulletin World Agricultural Production.
    
This puts the 1996-97 output in Pakistan at only slightly higher by about 
0.1 million during 1995-96, although the ministry of food & agriculture 
claimed the output to have been 10.6 million bales. In the current year, 
the official estimates vary from 9.7 to 11 million bales, although the 
situation continues to be fluid because of the pest attack and sudden drop 
in temperature cotton producing areas.
    
According to the USDA projection, the world cotton production for 1996-97 
will be 89.0 bales (of 200 kg. each), down 2.0 per cent from 1995-96. In 
the United States, production for 1996-97 is estimated at 19.0 million 
bales, up 6 percent from last season.

<a name="blac">Black money now 50% of GDP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 9: Qazi Masud Ahmad, a research economist of Applied Research 
Economic Centre (AREC) has estimated current ratio of black economy in 
Pakistan at 45 to 50 per cent of GDP which comes to about Rs 1,000 to Rs 
1,100 billion.
    
In his presentation on Level of Black Economy in Pakistan made on 
Wednesday, at a breakfast session of Pakistan Corporate Leaders Forum, an 
affiliate of Economists Conferences, Qazi Masud explained that the black 
economy ratio is estimated universally on a methodology worked out by a 
Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Vitotanzi in 80s.
    
Estimation of black economy ratio in accordance with Vitotanzi methodology, 
he said showed it at 9 per cent in USA, 15 per cent in UK, 28 per cent in 
India and 39 per cent in Pakistan during 1987.
    
Elaborating on the issue he classified black economy into two components. 
One component of such economy, he said, is reportable as it generates 
through legitimate sources but remains unaccounted or concealed to evade 
all three taxes which are income tax, excise and customs.
    
However, the other component of black economy, he identified, was 
unreportable as it generates from entirely illegal methods that can be 
smuggling of goods, drug money and leakages from public finance. The PIDE 
has however quantified to some extent, the black money being generated 
through inflow of goods from unauthorised channels but no one has been able 
to estimate the amount of drug money and leakages from public finance.

<a name="lead">Leading scrips tend further lower</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 9: Leading shares on the stock market came in for renewed 
selling and generally tended further lower in the absence of strong demand 
from any quarter.
    
There are more sellers than buyers as the heating up of the political 
scenario continue to inhibit new buying from most of the genuine 
investors, dealers said.
    
However, there was no panic selling as bulk of the selling was centred 
around the overvalued shares as a section of investors appeared to be in a 
haste to get out of the market as early as possible on predictions of 
further price erosions.
    
The investors and dealers apparently rejoiced the hasty retreat of the KSE 
board to revert to Friday as closed holiday, although opinions differed 
from broker to broker. The coming Friday, therefore, will be closed holiday 
as usual after one weeks change to Sunday.
    
The KSE 100-share index, therefore, shed another 12.15 points at 1,352.93 
as compared to 1,365.08 a day earlier as leading base shares fell sharply.
    
An idea of investor reluctance to re-enter the rings may well be had from 
the fact that Fauji Cement made debut in a falling market. It came on the 
board at Rs 11 against the face value of Rs 10 and steadily dropped to 
quote the lowest for the day Rs 5. Although the closing was bit higher at 
Rs 8, it was below Rs 2 its face value.
    
If the new issues from big business houses such as the Fauji Foundation, 
which has over a dozen large units in its fold and is known for its good 
profit-sharing policy, makes such a disappointing debut what investors 
could expect from others, said a leading floor broker.

However, the market was not without some special feature both in terms of 
large volumes and good gains though on selected counters.
    
Dadabhoy Insurance, for instance, surged by Rs 41 to 85, with 2,800 shares 
changing hands at this peak level, reflected that selective buyers are 
there.
    
Hinopak, which announced a good dividend of 50 per cent including 15 per 
cent interim and bonus shares at the rate of 20 per cent continued to 
inspire new buying on predictions that it could rise further. It earned a 
profit of Rs 176m on sale volume of Rs 2.6 bn for the year ended June 30, 
1996. It was traded higher by Rs 5.50 on 100 shares.
    
Other good gainers were led by 21st ICP Mutual Fund, Kohinoor Textiles, 
Nafees Cotton, Shell Pakistan, Dawood Hercules, Wyeth Lab and Grays of 
Cambridge rising by one rupee to Rs 2. Fourth ICP rose by Rs 10.
    
Although losses dominated the list, most of them were fractional and 
reflected lack of support rather than large selling from any quarter.
    
Leading losers were led by PSO, which suffered a fresh fall of Rs 7 on 
renewed selling followed by Engro Chemicals, Gatron, KESC, Brooke Bond, 
National Foods and Crescent Bank, falling by one rupee to Rs 2.50.
    
Dividend news both from Dadex and Ghemni Leasing at 22.5 and 10 per cent 
final were good but they came at a time when the market was overshadowed by 
some other depressing external factors. Both have paid an interim dividend 
at the rate of 20 and 10 per cent in that order.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouches, off 90 paisa on 8.140m 
shares, followed by Hub-Power, easy five paisa on 5.301m, ICI Pakistan (r), 
lower 45 paisa on 1.726m, ICI Pakistan down 40 paisa on 1.110m, and FFC-
Jordan fertiliser, lower five paisa on 0.724m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Dewan Salman, up 30 paisa on 
0.255m, Fauji fertiliser, steady 15 paisa on 0.360m, MCB, off 75 paisa on 
0.138m, and Genertech, lower 35 paisa on 0.117m shares.
    
Trading volume rose to 19.698m shares from the previous 16.696m shares 
owing to large selling in the current favourites.
    
There were 282 actives, out of which 137 shares fell, while 66 rose, with 
79 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="demo">Democracy is a dirty word</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

TODAY, in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, democracy is a dirty word. To 
borrow Oscar Wildes famous phrase: It is the bludgeoning of the people, by 
the people, for the people.

When this age of democracy dawned in 1988, we had visions of ancient 
Athens, of Cleisthenes and his reforms that replaced the old tribal 
constitution with the novel idea that political power should lie with the 
entire citizen body. We imagined that the revolutionary idea would be 
introduced whereby all citizens would be equal before the law and would be 
free to say what they wanted without fear of their rulers, their peers, 
their fellow citizens, or the mob. We thought that the time had come when 
the people would be the rulers, and the son of a peasant would be as good 
as a landlord. We were mad, we were very, very stupid.

What we should have known is that the greater majority of those that came 
into power, posing as the peoples representatives, had not the vaguest 
notion of the meaning of democracy. All they knew was how to manage their 
free and fair election victories, how to use, dupe, and buy the 
electorate. They came to preserve democracy, not to practise it.

Of the 130 million people of the country, how many vote, and out of those 
who vote, how many are literate? The aim of those that claw their way into 
our parliament is to sit out their full term, by hook or by crook, to 
justify the amount spent and squandered on being freely and fairly 
elected, to rob, to plunder, to lie, to cheat, and to exit fatter and 
richer than when they entered, so as to be able to do it all over again.

We have a written constitution, there to ensure that the government works 
for the betterment of the people and the state and not to their detriment. 
When it is read it must be read as a whole, and when it is interpreted what 
must be borne in mind is how it has been abused in the past and how it may 
be abused in the future. The paramount consideration must always be its 
original unambiguous spirit and purpose  the larger interest of the state.

Elsewhere, it is presupposed that those men and women elected as the 
peoples representatives possess unimpeachable characters. Not so in our 
case. Taking into account the quirks and drawbacks of the national 
character, it has been specifically mentioned in Article 62 that to qualify 
for election to parliament a person must possess eight specific endowments, 
the most meaningful being: of good character, sagacious, righteous, non-
profligate, honest and ameen.

How many of our bludgeoners possess any such qualifications? If the laid-
down standards were even liberally followed, we would be left with empty 
assemblies. As these past eight years have gone by, during which we have 
suffered three free and fair elections, our representatives have steadily 
worsened. With the lot we now have, may we hope we have at last reached 
rock-bottom.

There are only two ways in which a sitting government in Pakistan can be 
constitutionally sent home  one is a vote of no-confidence, the other is 
dissolution. It is absolutely impossible that any sitting government could 
lose a vote of no-confidence. Our government goons bully the opposition, 
abduct legislators and transport them at state expense to safe houses 
where they are kept at state expense. They win by terrorising and by 
bribing.

Thus, the use of Article 58(2)(b) by the President is the sole way out. 
Constitutionally speaking, the President is supposed to be neutral, strong, 
just and generous. Our President, Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Tumandar 
Leghari, failed us. However, of late, realising his own predicament and 
having satisfied himself that under no circumstances will his former party 
nominate him for a second presidential term, with the support of the 
bayonet he is now attempting to walk the straight path. Having fortified 
himself with yet another free Umra at our expense, he is trying to do the 
right thing  to weed out corruption. He is likely to endorse, in toto, the 
lists prepared in Rawalpindi and to recommend punitive action against the 
persons listed. Should he continue to sail on this new tack, he must be 
supported.

Having changed his approach, having stiffened himself and taken cognisance 
of the sins of the government he has supported for too long, he should 
change his life-style and win over the people. President Gonez Arpad of 
Hungary, for instance, lived in a modest house, answered his own doorbell, 
made his own toast, boiled his own egg, drove his own car, and did not go 
hunting and shooting and on pilgrimages at the expense of the Hungarian 
people. Leghari should try to act as is expected of a leader in this 
poverty-stricken country, bankrupt and broke, reeling from the ever-
increasing blows it has borne over the years.

The single brightness in the gloom: the Chief Justice of Pakistan Sajjad 
Ali Shah, atop the other pillar of equal strength, supported by his brother 
judges (most of whom have refused to bow to pressure), has finally achieved 
the implementation of the Supreme Court judgement of March 20, 1996.

Adding to our woes is the slaying of Murtaza Bhutto, leader of the 
terrorist organisation, the AZO, and male head of a political family that 
deems its birthright is to rule Pakistan. He did not approve of the ruling 
princes, white, red or black, nor did the princes approve of him. Being the 
brother of the prime minister, he was a law unto himself and led his own 
army of unauthorised armed men, many of whom had allegedly trained in 
India. Days before his killing, in search of one of his lieutenants, Ali 
Sonara, who had been arrested on a series of charges of terrorism, he and 
his army raided two CIA posts in Karachi, disarmed and roughed up the 
police forces. This was an excuse for the authorities to be 
authoritative, and orders were issued to deal with Murtaza.

The Prime Minister, a student of Islamic history, knows that succession is 
determined by the length of the sword and the sharpness of its blade. She 
declared that the killing was a conspiracy, that her brother had been 
murdered. She did not name the conspirators or the suspects. The only 
person she named was an SSP, Wajid Ali Durrani, who had put himself in 
charge of the operation of September 20. Without any loss of time, she 
declared that he was totally innocent of any involvement in the 
conspiracy. Durrani has links with the Zardari family, was hand-picked by 
Islamabad and posted as SSP (South), Karachi. Also sent to Karachi by the 
Prime Minister, a few days prior to the 20th, was Petaro-crony Masud 
Sharif, Director of the Intelligence Bureau, ostensibly to help out in 
Sonaras interrogation.

So far, apart from Murtaza and his men, a police officer who allegedly 
suffered a self-suffered injury during the shoot-out on the 20th, has 
been mysteriously shot and killed. To help clear the haze, Interior 
Minister General Babar has deputed his own axeman, Rahman Malik, chief of 
the FIA, to join the investigation team.

Worse to follow, the Taliban, trained and armed by Pakistan, the United 
States and others, have conquered Kabul and are on their way North, a move 
serious enough for a sick Yeltsin to get out of his bed and take note. The 
Great Game of last century has resumed. This time, in the mountains, the 
challenge comes from Mullahs and Maulanas Omar, Ghous, Muttaqi, Hafizullah 
& Co and their heavily armed men who are taking on Dostum & Co. Whoever be 
the winner, we will be the losers.

I hope the ISI has reported to the Chief of Army Staff, General Jehangir 
Karamat, the recent exchange between Taliban Ameer-ul-Momineen Mullah 
Mohammed Omar and his foreign minister Maulana Haji Mohammed Ghous: Who 
was this man Mortimer Durand and where did he draw his Line the Pakistan 
keep hankering about? Queried the Ameer. Whoever he was, we know not, and 
whatever he may have drawn wherever, we see not, was Ghouss reply. Where 
is our Palmerston?

<a name="what">What price Taliban victory?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

THOSE of us hankering to bring back an idealised notion of the past have 
only to look across the border into Afghanistan to realise what nightmares 
such daydreams can turn into.

Aptly dubbed "donkey boys" by more sophisticated Afghans, the Taliban have, 
with suspicious speed, taken over Kabul and are now in charge of our 
unfortunate neighbour's destiny. Although a succession of their 
predecessors have not left them with brilliant models of governance to 
follow, the Taliban's initial moves have not exactly been designed to 
placate their detractors. Indeed, their contempt for the rule of law as 
well as all norms of civilised behaviour was evident in their first few 
hours in the Afghan capital. By gunning down and then hanging Najibullah 
and his brother for days after desecrating the bodies, they signalled that 
finally Afghanistan had regressed into the stone age.
    
With the Taliban victory has come the most backward attitude towards women 
in the world. No other society  not even Saudi Arabia  has relegated 
women to such an inferior position as the Afghans under the Taliban.
    
Although the new leaders of Afghanistan made no secret of their intentions, 
we tended to dismiss their zealotry and their viciousness as yet another 
localised bit of nastiness our neighbours had inflicted on themselves. 
Women in Kandhar and Herat had been virtually incarcerated after the 
Taliban established their rule in those historic cities.
    
But the reality of Taliban rule came home to us when their rag-tag army 
rolled into a virtually defenceless Kabul without having to fire a shot. 
One of their first decrees was to tell women to stop working and stay at 
home; several women have been severely beaten in public for not adhering to 
the strict Taliban dress code. Civil servants have been directed to grow 
beards in six weeks, or else. Children have been ordered not to fly kites.
    
Clearly, such a nation is bound to become first an international pariah and 
then a basket case. No country with any kind of liberal democratic 
credentials would want to have anything to do with such a government. No 
international agency will lend money to a country which treats its women 
like third class citizens.
    
What are the implications for Pakistan of a Taliban government in Kabul? 
Apart from the spate of refugees this latest crisis will inevitably cause, 
there are a number of internal and external problems that will flow from 
the change of guard in Kabul. For starters, the whole world is convinced 
that some organisations in Pakistan have helped the most backward group in 
Afghanistan (or anywhere else for that matter) to gain power, thus pushing 
that ravaged country back still further.
    
By looking at religious dogma in isolation from a swiftly changing world, 
we blind ourselves to how the world community views these utopian attempts 
to recreate an imagined ideal society. For one, the tribal order that 
existed hundreds of years ago has no relevance to present-day issues and 
problems. The world has shrunk too much to think we can go our own way. The 
only reason Saudi Arabia can insulate itself from notions like democracy 
and human rights is that it has the oil wealth to buy off internal and 
external pressures. We do not have this luxury.
    
It is not tenable to ascribe sundry excesses to our faith because Islam 
certainly does not condone torture, execution without due process or the 
subjugation of women. On the contrary, it was an enlightened religion when 
it was revealed and has enjoined justice and good governance on rulers. For 
the Taliban or our own home-grown begots to use the scriptures in support 
of their poisonous words and cruel deeds is utterly outlandish.
    
Almost inevitably, all obscurantist movements and parties place heavy 
emphasis on curtailing women's rights. It is almost as if religious zealots 
feel threatened by them. Indeed, they alienate much of the civilised world 
by their archaic desire to lock up half the population in an era where 
women are more active in every field than ever before. And while some of 
our religious preachers keep predicting the imminent collapse of an 
"immoral" Western society, we can see that the same society is making rapid 
progress while we stand still. Or, if the Taliban among us have their way, 
go back to the stone age.
    
An inevitable consequence of the change in Kabul will be the strain the 
Taliban victory will put on our relations with Iran. The reason we 
supported the Taliban is that in our calculus, they have the best chance to 
impose peace in Afghanistan, thus finally giving us access to Central Asia. 
Fat chance. It is inevitable that the Tajiks and other non-Pushtun elements 
will hole out in the north and continue to fight on with help from their 
brethren in the Central Asian Republics.

<a name="whoi">Who is conspiring against whom?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

ALTHOUGH, as every last newspaper reader in the country is aware by now, Ms 
Bhutto of the swinging gait and the sharp handbag has been tempting the 
fates, the furies and the other elemental forces which bring mortals to 
their doom, the game is still not lost for her. Even at this late hour she 
can retrieve it provided she can rein in her hard instincts and remove the 
blinkers from her eyes.
    
President Farooq Leghari has not taken to his assertive role in a void. If 
anyone has pushed him to it, it is Ms Bhutto herself. Indeed, with the 
entire country virtually howling that he should do something, the President 
would have had to be made of stone not to try even now to bring the 
government to its senses. It is only the malicious, therefore, who will 
charge him with intriguing against the bastions of democracy. No such game 
is afoot in Islamabad. Neither the President is scheming against Ms Bhutto 
nor for that matter the top brass of the army which has no desire to act as 
the fire brigade of democracy. Hard though it may be for hardened 
conspiracy theorists to believe, both want the democratic system to be 
strengthened and for the system itself to correct the failings of 
Pakistani-style democracy.
    
If there is any conspiracy afoot, the strands of it are being woven by the 
government itself, through its pure blindness and its refusal to see the 
light. If the government stands discredited, as it surely is, it is not 
because of any misinformation campaign mounted by its enemies. Through 
their actions and their brazenness the men and women (what need to recount 
their names?) running this latter-day Mughal court which passes for the 
government of Pakistan would have discredited a nunnery or a college of 
cardinals.
    
The question therefore is not what the President might do or what the army 
is likely to support. It is altogether different: can Ms Bhutto read the 
writing on the wall and, having performed this arduous task, can she bring 
herself to change her ways? The age of miracles might have passed but if 
she can suffer this transformation she can still, conceivably, sort out the 
mess in which she and her government are mired.
    
It was a Hitlerian maxim that one should always concentrate on the 
essential and eschew ruthlessly the non-essential. Ms Bhuttos great 
contribution to the art of government has been to focus her formidable 
energies relentlessly on the non-essential. In the process she has 
manufactured artificial crises which the government, to the exclusion of 
other business, is then required to resolve. The crisis with the judiciary, 
a prime example of the non-essential, need never have erupted. But through 
a mixture of short-sightedness and arrogance once it had, it should have 
been quickly settled. After all, Ms Bhuttos survival, which must be the 
first concern of every politician, did not hang upon the outcome. 
Similarly, the President, given a measure of sensitivity on the 
governments part, need never have been goaded into his present mode of 
self-assertiveness. But this having come to pass, wisdom lies in moving 
fast on accountability, which the Presidents message to Parliament 
desires, thus pre-empting further strictures or action from that quarter.
    
But the question again is: is Ms Bhutto capable of curbing her instinct to 
tilt at windmills? The omens certainly are not propitious. It is not only 
that temperament (more than character) is destiny. Ms Bhutto is also 
hamstrung by the quality of the people she is surrounded by. What good is 
it possible to expect from a dispensation whose Chief Magician is Mr Ahmed 
Sadiq, Lead Trumpeter Mr Kharal and Chief Policeman General Babar? These 
names are taken at random. There is not a sliver of independent thinking in 
all the glittering array of Ms Bhuttos court. Who then is to tell her of 
the elder von Moltkes dictum that cardinal strategic errors should not be 
made because once committed they are impossible to rectify? The fight with 
the Supreme Court was one such error. The straining of ties with the 
Presidency another.
    
In this dialectics of strategy consider for a moment the plight of the 
hapless people of Pakistan. If through a supreme act of self-control Ms 
Bhutto forsakes her fight with the windmills, all that will happen is that 
her present stricken chances of completing her term will improve. 
Otherwise, will it have the slightest effect on the public good?
    
It needs to be remembered that all the crises afflicting the Pakistani 
state over the last ten or twenty years have revolved around issues of 
power, not the welfare of the people. Bhutto vs Zia, Zia vs Junejo, Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan vs Benazir, Ghulam Ishaq Khan vs Nawaz Sharif: what was the 
relevance of these mighty battles to the common man whose lot has been to 
carry the burden of the extravagance and maladministration of the Pakistani 
state? And now Farooq Leghari vs Benazir Bhutto. This struggle is different 
from its forerunners if only because some issue of principle rather than of 
naked power is involved. All the same, even if it is satisfactorily 
resolved it takes a leap of faith to imagine that the frontiers of the 
extravagant state will be rolled back or that work will start in earnest to 
erect a more caring dispensation.
    
What a big deal is being made of corruption these days. But every one is 
aware of the hurdles in the path of bringing the corrupt to book. Even if 
an independent accountability commission is set up it would need an army of 
honest and vigilant investigators to come up with cases with evidence hard 
enough to stand the test of judicial scrutiny. We have seen in the recent 
past that even when governments have been bent upon victimisation, all the 
states resources have not been sufficient to bring foolproof cases before 
the courts. That is why every politician, general and bureaucrat worth his 
salt against whom a charge of corruption is brought is proudly able to 
declare his innocence.
    
Admittedly, an independent accountability commission (if government and 
opposition, overcoming their misgivings, can set about agreeing on one) 
will be a step forward in the present situation but it will face an uphill 
task. Fat cats in the business of making money by foul means are usually 
not in the habit of leaving any traces behind. In the capital it is no 
secret as to the governmental and bureaucratic figures who have grown fat 
on the slime and corruption of the last three years. But even if that 
bright day dawns when a crusade is launched against the pot-bellies of 
Islamabads richest and finest, what will be the chances of bringing them 
to book?
    
According to our Anglo-Saxon legal system, the onus of proving guilt rests 
with the prosecution, the most consummate blackguard being considered 
innocent unless otherwise proved. Unless the spirit of the proposed anti-
corruption laws is changed so as to put the burden of proving innocence on 
the shoulders of the defendant against whom a prima facie case of 
corruption can be made, cleansing the national stables will not be an easy 
task.
    
But all this is to anticipate the future. At the moment both sides in 
Parliament are yet to go beyond their thunderous rhetoric about corruption 
and get down to actual legislation even though they are well aware that 
delay in this regard would be fatal as it would compel the President to 
weigh other options in order to force the governments hands  options not 
necessarily to the oppositions advantage.
    
Will Ms Bhutto, therefore, recognise the necessity of taking urgent 
measures to meet the challenges she faces or, true to her temperament, will 
she keep giving hostages to fortune? In this predicament she could do worse 
than to consider what Edward Crankshaw (a biographer of Bismarcks) has to 
say about the masters ability to conduct an abrupt retreat: ...he knew 
better than anyone in the world how to go into reverse and extricate 
himself from a difficult situation. The trick was quite simple: it was to 
stop what he was doing and do the opposite without asking whether he could 
afford to lose face. He was one of the very few public men to understand 
that if you do not care about face you have nothing to lose.

<a name="andg">Pakistan and global disarmament</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto

WITH the madness of the cold war behind us, today, nuclear disarmament is 
both more feasible and more imperative. 
    
It is essential that we at last heed the very first resolution of the UN 
General Assembly and begin the elimination from national arsenals of 
atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction.
    
No one needs these weapons  including the current nuclear powers. And if 
the armaments are retained, they will only be more improved and are likely 
to proliferate. And in these uncertain times, the danger of nuclear 
miscalculation or accident is greater than ever before.
    
Pakistan finds itself squarely in the middle of the nuclear conundrum, and 
we stand firm in our support of both nuclear and conventional arms control 
and disarmament both globally and regionally. For instance, last month in 
the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, Pakistan and 27 other non-aligned 
countries proposed a specific plan for the complete elimination of nuclear 
weapons.
    
In fact, even the International Court of Justice has ruled that the nuclear 
powers have an obligation to undertake good- faith negotiations for nuclear 
disarmament. I certainly hope these talks begin in the Geneva Conference 
early next year.
    
Nuclear disarmament is just one side of the coin, however, with nuclear 
non-proliferation being the other important issue. This is of particular 
importance to Pakistan, given the development of Indias nuclear weapons 
programme. Although we voted in favour of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation 
Treaty in 1968 and have supported a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, India 
has been particularly resistant to any and all efforts to free our region 
from the nuclear threat.
    
When Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru inaugurated Indias Atomic Energy 
Commission in 1948, he spoke of the use of nuclear technology for 
protection. By contrast, when Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto began 
the Karachi Nuclear Power Reactor in 1972, he called for the creation of a 
nuclear weapons free zone in South Asia. Since 1974, India has been the 
sole opponent in the region to a zone of this type.
    
Beginning as early as the 1950s, India was assisted by many advanced 
countries in developing its nuclear programme, mostly outside international 
safeguards. Pakistans repeated and explicit warnings that India would 
misuse its civil facilities to build nuclear bombs were ignored.
    
Then, when India conducted its nuclear explosion in May 1974, Pakistan was 
confronted with tangible evidence of an open nuclear threat. Perversely, 
our International Atomic Energy Agency-sponsored nuclear energy programme 
was the primary victim of the Indian explosion. All peaceful nuclear co-
operation with Pakistan was stopped, and penalties were imposed on us for 
obtaining the same technologies that had been readily available to India.
    
The United States joined in with a series of laws that were aimed against 
Pakistans programme while ignoring Indias proliferation activities. And 
after 1991, the Pressler Law halted virtually all co-operation between 
Pakistan and America. Fortunately, the actions of Sen. Hank Brown and 
President Bill Clinton have begun to redress this injustice.
    
Despite repeatedly being the scapegoat of the international community, 
Pakistan has continued to make proposal after proposal to promote non-
proliferation in South Asia.
    
Among the suggestions we have made and India has rejected are: simultaneous 
signature of the non-proliferation treaty, simultaneous acceptance of IAEA 
regulation, reciprocal inspection of each others nuclear facilities, joint 
renouncement of the acquisition, manufacture and deployment of nuclear 
weapons on our soil, and a regional conference on non-proliferation.
    
More recently, Pakistan has proposed the creation of a Zero Missile Zone in 
South Asia, and once again, a deafening silence prevails in New Delhi.
    
For over 40 years, India has masked its nuclear ambitions by posing as the 
champion of nuclear disarmament. It spurned Pakistans proposals for 
regional non-proliferation in South Asia on the grounds that it could 
accept only global measures. But this hypocrisy has been exposed by Indias 
recent solitary opposition to the test-ban treaty.
    
How has the international community responded to Indias obstinacy? With 
appeasement and supplication, thereby emboldening Indias leaders. Now, 
preparations are underway for a second nuclear test at Pokharan, and short-
range Prithvi missiles are in the process of being deployed along our 
common border. In addition, India is now testing the Agni medium-range 
missile.
    
US Secretary of Defence William Perry has rightly described South Asia as 
the most dangerous place in the world. And Pakistan is committed to 
giving a matching response to any nuclear escalation by India.
    
It is essential, then, to find a resolution to this crisis. This could be 
accomplished through three interrelated goals: a just and peaceful solution 
to the Kashmir dispute, negotiation of agreements on conventional arms 
control, and non-proliferation arrangements beginning with some measures 
for nuclear self- restraint, such as the restriction of missile deployment 
and an end to nuclear tests.
    
Such a comprehensive dialogue was rejected by India two years ago, but we 
remain willing to try. The world community must recognise that a solution 
to the problems of conflict, arms control and non-proliferation in South 
Asia is essential for the safety of everyone. Nuclear weapons are a global 
problem  and they require a global solution.Copyright 1996 Creators

By Mohammad Shoaib Ahmed

When the Sri Lankan and Kenyan captains went in for the toss in Gymkhana 
Ground Nairobi on September 27, to mark the start of the first match of the 
four-nation tournament between the two countries, Kenya became the 14th 
country and 104th centre to stage a one-day International. Such matches 
have been played on 111 grounds. If the two grounds in London, Lord's and 
The Oval, are treated as separate ODI centres. Colombo has stayed one-day 
International at three different grounds while Ahmedabad, Bombay, Hobart 
and Rawalpindi each have hosted these matches at two different grounds.
    
Cricket in Kenya was first played in Mombassa on the coast at the turn of 
the century. The game began to spread as the country developed. The major 
fixture of the year being the three-day officials vs Colonial settlers, 
first played in 1910. European and Asian (people from the sub-continent) 
developed along separate lines as the Europeans formed the Kongoni Cricket 
Club in 1927 and the Asian, the Asian Sports Association, which started in 
1933.
    
In 1953 the Kenya Cricket Association was formed, uniting the Asian and 
European organisations. The year 1963 over the visit of MCC side led by 
M.J.K. Smith. Cricket until then was played on matting wickets. The first 
turf wickets were laid at Nairobi Club in 1969 and Suleiman Verjee Indian 
Gymkhana in 1973. The triangular tournament with Uganda and Tanganjika (now 
Tanzania) began in 1966 and was played on an annual basis, rotating from 
country to country. Zambia joined in 1973.
    
Since mid-60s numerous clubs and representative sides have visited Kenya, 
including Hyderabad Blues, Rajisthan, Warwickshire, Nigeria, Denmark, 
Combined Countries XI, Bangladesh, Pakistan "B", India as well as England 
"A" and Zimbabwe, both of whom were beaten by Kenya in one-day games. Kenya 
participated in a tour to England in 1972 as part of an East African 
cricket conference side and also took part in the first World Cup in 1975 
under that banner.
    
Kenya withdrew from the East African cricket conference in 1981 and toured 
UK in 1984 as guests of Minor Countries. Kenya has taken part in the past 
four ICC tournaments in 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994. In 1990 Kenya reached the 
semi-finals for the first time losing an exciting match to host Holland.
    
The 80s saw the emergence of some fine young African players, nine of whom 
made the squad to the 1990 ICC tournament. This augurs well and is one of 
the main reasons why Kenya looks forward to a bright future for cricket.  
When the Indian team stopped here on their way home from the South African 
tour for a friendly game in 1993, captain Azharuddin was full of admiration 
for the indigenous Kenyans. "Right kind of training and they could blossom 
into international stuff," observed the Indian skipper. Kenya has excellent 
infrastructure and together with Ireland Bangladesh are the only associate 
countries with grass wickets.
    
Four years ago Collin Eager, former President of Australian Cricket Board 
passed through Kenya and after looking at the grounds he was amazed at the 
excellent infrastructure and complimented the Kenyans on the quality of the 
wickets provided.
    
Many ex-Indian Test players play for the local club as professionals. 
Players like Sandeep Patil, Balwinder Singh Sandhu, Chanderkant Pandit and 
Ghulam Parkar have been playing for the last five years while Inshuman 
Gaikwad, Raju Kulkarni, Dilip Vengsarkar and Vinod Kambli have done short 
stints with some of the clubs.
    
Who would have expected Kenya to beat the West Indies? It was a big 
surprise West Indies once deemed invincible in the limited overs games and 
twice world champions, were humbled and humiliated by Kenya. If the Kenyans 
failed to use that stunning success as a springboard, then you can put that 
down to inexperience. For, there is no doubting their talent. Are said and 
done the Kenyans have succeeded in making a mark for themselves and, with 
greater exposure in future they might as well to knocking at the doors of 
test cricket.

<a name="need">Needed: a clear-cut selection policy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Lateef Jafri

THE recent string of illness and injuries among seasoned players has 
considerably depleted the forces trying to measure strength with the 
formidable assemblage of cricketers that South Africa and world champions 
Sri Lanka have in their ranks. The woes of the visiting squad in Kenya were 
compounded when even captain Wasim Akram, not in full health, had to rush 
back to the Punjab metropolis to attend on his father, having suffered a 
massive stroke.
    
However, the choice of the players to fill the breach created by such 
experienced campaigners as Inzamamul Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed and Aamir Sohail 
and latterly the dispatch of a replacement for Wasim betrayed utter 
confusion among the selectors for the time being reduced to a membership of 
two instead of the original and normal three. It also gave the impression, 
rather superficially, to the fans and followers of the game of extreme 
dearth of talent at home, whatever may be the activities of cricket round 
the year and official schedule of tournaments as chalked out by the board 
itself.
    
Initially the selectors spurned the demand of the tour committee, which 
included two of its ex-officio members viz skipper Wasim Akram and cricket 
manager Mushtaq Mohammad, for certain players and opted for a junior 
bowler, who was on tour of the Caribbean with the second string. Certainly 
his inclusion would strain the physical capabilities of Waqar Younis, 
Saqlain Mushtaq, the regular bowlers, and Salim Malik, who is only a casual 
and change bowler. Besides once the Waqar and Wasim combination, the two 
fastest of contemporary speed merchants, is broken, the former may be 
contained and countered, with comparative ease, by the opposing batsmen. It 
was surprising how one player, the junior Shahid Afridi, a leg breaker, 
would have made up for the absence of a wily spinner of world class and 
invariably an insoluble problem for the batsmen. Later on when Aamir Sohail 
also voluntarily opted out the Chief selector, Salim Altaf, had to make 
telephonic communication with his associate in Karachi, Zaheer Abbas, and 
it was decided that all vacancies, caused due to unfortunate circumstances, 
would be filled. Ramiz, a former captain, and Saeed Azad, a middle order 
batsman, were chosen to accompany the altered conglomerate for Kenya.
    
After one match in the quadrangular in Nairobi Wasim Akram too flew back 
home, leaving the selectors in a quandary. As media reports indicate the 
selectors tried to locate Mohammad Akram, presently in England, but could 
not contact him. Their choice, Mohammad Zahid, a raw pacer, came as a 
complete surprise to the cricket watchers. Everybody thought if at all the 
Kenya one-dayers are to be taken seriously and are not to be written off 
then Aqib Javed will get the chance. A hard trier with control over line 
and length, Javed has the scalps of many an organised batsman. He 
challenges the willow-wielders with his skilful pacers from the very first 
ball. Then his energy, rhythm and accuracy earn the appreciation of the 
onlookers. It is still not known why he is being passed over though the 
selectors' chief says he will get his pound of flesh during the coming 
season when foreign teams will be visiting this country.
    
The game's officials, cricket manager included, have been stressing that 
they are building up a squad for the next World Cup. However, if talented 
cricketers like Aqib Javed and Rashid Latif, who was twice mentioned as an 
essential requirement, once it was known that the knee problem of Mushtaq 
and Inzamam has aggravated, are ignored how the hunt for new faces for 
future will be successful.
    
One finds that Zahid, with 22 wickets last season, has superseded Ali Gohar 
(47 wickets), Sajid Shah (46 scalps), Ather Laiq (40 victims) and gutsy 
all-rounder Aamir Hanif (36 wickets) to name only a few from a long list of 
fine performers.
    
The logic behind the selection of Ramiz Raja and Saeed Azad cannot be 
understood. Ramiz, 34, had his baptism in Test cricket thirteen years ago 
and must now be at the end of his career. He is not a brisk strokeplayer 
for limited-overs ties. As can be seen from the scorecard in the match 
against low-rated Kenya he returned to the pavilion with a duck to his 
credit. Besides, how many openers are required in the line-up?
    
The selection of Saeed Azad, whose contribution in the match against Kenya 
was just 1, can hardly be justified. His score in an earlier exposure 
against Sri Lanka in Rawalpindi last year (a match lost by Pakistan) was 
insignificant. But why exclude Asif Mujtaba, a tried all-rounder, Sohail 
Jaffar (1,465 runs last season), Mohammad Nawaz (1,205 runs), Azam Khan 
(1,281 runs). The last-mentioned can be utilised at any position. Many are 
doubtful if the decisions of the selectors are based purely on merit. There 
is no clear-cut policy but experiments and makeshift arrangements.
    
One hopes that after the selectors trio is complete with the endorsement of 
former Test all-rounder Ejaz Fakih by the Council an in-depth discussion 
will take place on the right mode and method of selection. The quality 
players  batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders  are not in short supply in 
the country but fair judgement is needed for a balanced outfit and for 
lifting home cricket.

<a name="poin">Points to ponder for sports policy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Alauddin Ghuari

The Federal Sports Minister, like his predecessors, has gone on record to 
state that the National Sports Policy would soon be announced. However, it 
is to be seen as to when this long-standing commitment is honoured. We do 
not know as to what briefing he has received and by whom and whether or not 
various causes leading to the dismal state of sports have been brought to 
his notice.
    
In our humble opinion the Sports Minister should keep the following facts 
in mind. It is an accepted and recognised fact that Pakistan occupied a 
very respectable place in Asia during the first fifteen years of its 
existence. This country won 13 medals in the 2nd Asian Games in 1954; 26 in 
1958 and our tally in 1962 was 28. History is a witness to the fact that 
these achievements were due to dedication, devotion and sincerity displayed 
by the Federations.
    
The Federal government promulgated an Ordinance in 1962 and the Pakistan 
Sports Board (PSB) came into being. The new-born was a bad omen for 
Pakistan sports as we could only manage 8 medals in 1966 in Bangkok; 
Pakistan could not, thereafter achieve heights to win 28 medals in any of 
the subsequent Asian Games.
   
The reason for the sudden fall was the interference by the so called 
technocrats of PSB using the cover provided by the Ordinance which reads. 
This Ordinance shall be called the sports development and 'control' 
Ordinance 1962'. First part i.e. development, was totally ignored and the 
bureaucrats of PSB exploited the word control to their own advantage. 
Development to the bureaucrats meant building of an odd stadium, swimming 
pool and raising the economic standards of sportsmen.
    
The PSB, with a view to exercising tight and full control over the sports 
bodies, completely alienated honest and devoted sports administrators which 
caused abrupt decline in the standards and of course success role. 
Comparative amply confirm and prove the pound.
    
Success of any policy and system depends on the persons who implement it. 
Those responsible to ensure the success of the 1962 policy, however, 
demonstrated lack of sense of purpose and loyalty thus causing irreparable 
damage to the policy itself. The PSB did not pay any attention towards 
development of sports or infrastructure as people at the helm were neither 
mentally nor technically equipped for the task. The National Institute of 
Sports and Culture (NISC) a high sounding name established in 1975, has NOT 
done anything to justify its establishment or to help develop positive 
mental attitude of sportsmen which is the top prerequisite to improve 
standards.
    
News media, particularly electronic, plays an important role in the 
promotion of sports in any country. It is highly regrettable that the PTV 
does not have its own sports policy. Its sole consideration to fill its 
coffers. The Sports Minister can use both PTV and NISC to help develop 
positive mental attitude. The latter under the existing conditions should 
either be abolished or placed under the PSB.
    
It is an irony of fate that the officials connected with sports misused and 
misinterpreted the meanings of the word 'control 'used in the said 
Ordinance. All sports bodies, the world over, affiliated with the 
international sports organisations, carry out their functions in accordance 
with their constitution. Sports bodies of a country are controlled by their 
parent international federations. Similarly, all international federations 
are governed in accordance with the International Olympic Committee 
charter. Sports officials do not have the right or authority to exercise 
control over indigenous sports federations. They need only to regulate the 
functioning of these bodies within the bounds of respective constitutions.
    
The misuse of the word 'control' has brought two important institutions of 
sports i.e. Federations and PSB, to a state of confrontation rather than 
co-operation to the determent of both on the one have partial approach 
towards certain games has further aggravated the situation and on the other 
the enthusiasm and desire to improve economic standards of athletes has 
totally destroyed the club system which in the real sense helped to promote 
the standards through discipline.
   
Semi-government institutions fully exploited the situation to their 
advantage and managed to lure top athletes. The intention was also to deny 
services of the top athletes to other institutions. This policy took away 
the competitive spirit resulting in premature retirements. These 
institutions are wasting a huge sum on non-promotional measures.
    
The PIA sports, for example is headed by a Director who is assisted by 6 
GMs. The huge amount of money spent on their salaries, perks, facilities 
and TA/DA could have been better spent on the development of the games and 
expansion of facilities. Similarly the patronage of those sports which have 
glamour and ignoring of others which have talent in abundance in the 
country wrought havoc.
   
Why are sports like athletics boxing and swimming meted out step motherly 
treatment by these institutions which also come under some ministry? The 
government should in consultation with POA and Federations lay down terms 
and conditions including national pay scales for the employment of 
sportsmen at the national and provincial levels.
    
The Minister of Sports has the right and authority to formulate sports 
policy. It may, however, be advisable and prudent to assess the performance 
of the institutions and sports set ups at the Federal and provincial 
levels. His efforts would be productive if he ensured that necessary 
infrastructure exists and sports flourish in a conducive atmosphere.

<a name="safr">S. Africa lift cricket cup with 7-wkt win over Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

NAIROBI, Oct.6: Showing in a thoroughly professional manner, South Africa 
beat Pakistan by seven wickets to lift the four-nation cricket trophy at 
the Nairobi Gymkhana ground on Sunday afternoon.
    
Nothing went right for the Pakistan team, comprising half a dozen young 
players who came as replacement for the injured stars, during this all-
important match of the competition. Pakistan were shot out for 203 in 46.2 
overs after acting captain Saeed Anwar had won the toss and opted to bat 
first on a pitch full of runs. Alan Donald, Brian McMillan and David 
Crookes bowled superbly on this batting pitch and restricted Pakistan to a 
low and manageable score. Later, despite South Africa having lost two 
wickets on two consecutive deliveries from young leg-spinner Shahid Afridi, 
Gary Kirsten batted like a sheet-anchor to take his side home. He was 
lustily cheered by a strong jam-packed crowd of 12,000 when declared as Man 
of the Final.
    
By dint of excellent performance throughout the competition, Alan Donald 
earned the Man of the Series award and a prize of 3000 dollars. Pakistan 
team captain Saeed Anwar got the runners-up trophy and an award of 25,000 
dollars while South African captain Hansie Cronje was awarded a beautiful 
trophy (depicting traditional Kenyan wildlife) and a cheque of 50,000 
dollars.
    
Not a single Pakistani batsman could score a half-century. That was because 
of the dominance of the South African bowlers despite many dropped catches 
and fielding lapses early in the Pakistan innings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 6: Shahid Khan Afridi during his whirlwind knock of 102 from 
40 balls against Sri Lanka at Kenya on Friday made three records and not 
two, investigations revealed.
    
The two records mentioned in the agency reports are: quickest 100 from 37 
balls surpassing Jayasuriyas 100 of 48 balls; and youngest-ever batsman at 
16 to score a one-day century.
    
However, the record which went unnoticed is he has also hit the highest 
number of sixes in his 100 i.e. 11 which is equal to sixes hit by 
Jayasuriya in his 134 against Pakistan at Singapore. Previous record of the 
highest number of sixes in 100 was also with Jayasuriya who had hit seven 
sixesfour less than Shahid Khan Afridi.
    
Shahid Khan Afridis break-up of 102 from 40 balls is: 13 non-scoring 
shots, eight singles, two twos, six fours and 11 sixes.

<a name="zimb">Zimbabwean team arrive, hopeful of giving fight</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Reporter

LAHORE, Oct. 8: Zimbabwe cricket captain Alistair Campbell hoped his side 
would do well in the coming Test and one-day series against Pakistan. He 
was talking to newsmen on arrival of the team after a long journey here 
Tuesday afternoon.
    
Campbell, who was one of the few players to have left a serious impression 
when Zimbabwe last toured Pakistan in 1993, said his side was much more 
experienced than three years ago and that he was not much worried over the 
teams recent drubbing at the hands of Sri Lanka in the Test and one-
dayers.
    
It was very early in the season and we got undone by the spinners in Sri 
Lanka, who are quite formidable at home and have also beaten a number of 
top Test-playing countries. but we are not unduly worried, he said.
    
Alistair Campbell said his players have worked very hard for the series 
against Pakistan and would go all out to prove themselves against a mighty 
opposition. Zimbabwe, he added, were a much more experienced side as 
compared to 1993 when they last toured Pakistan.
    
I wont say our team is much more stronger than 1993. Its much more 
experienced...and experience counts a lot. Last time there were a lot of 
positive things that came out of our play and the Press here wrote very 
highly of us. I think weve come out leaps and bounds from that. And if we 
play according to our potential, I am sure we can achieve some results, 
said Alistair Campbell.

<a name="esse">Essex show interest in Saeed Anwar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 9: Flamboyant Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar is in serious 
negotiations with English county Essex for the 1996 season, well placed 
sources said.
    
Essex are looking for Stuart Laws replacement who will be touring England 
next year with the Australian team for the Ashes.
    
Saeed Anwar, who scored more than 1,000 runs on the England tour earlier 
this summer, has a tie with Inzamamul Haq for the vacant slot but sources 
said Anwar may overcome his team-mate and may be announced as Essexs 
overseas player later this month.
    
Another English county, Surrey, have shown their interest in Pakistan off-
spinner Saqlain Mushtaq. Surrey are searching a replacement for Australian 
Brendon Julian who is also expected to be in England with the Australian 
side next summer.
    
After Surrey lost Waqar Younis because of their laziness, the English 
county has now diverted its attention to a spinner and have also held 
deliberations with Indian Anil Kumble besides Saqlain Mushtaq.
    
Kumble, the Indian vice-captain, had a season with Northamptonshire in 1994 
in which he took 105 wickets but was replaced with West Indian Curtly 
Ambrose.
    
With Northamptonshire having signed Pakistan pacer Mohammad Akram for the 
1997 season, indications are either Saqlain or Kumble will be Surreys 
overseas professional.
    
Wasim Akram (Lancashire), Waqar Younis (Glamorgan), Mushtaq Ahmad 
(Somerset) and Mohammad Akram (Northamptonshire) have already confirmed 
their return to English Championships next season. If negotiations 
materialise, Saeed Anwar and Saqlain Mushtaq may take Pakistans 
representation in the summer of England to six.</pre>
