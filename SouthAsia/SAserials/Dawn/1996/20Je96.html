Bureau Report

LAHORE, June 19: President Sardar Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said he is 
in agreement with the people complaining that the rulers, including 
himself, and the elected representatives are not willing to set their 
living standards according to the economic conditions of the country and 
the well-to-do are not paying taxes according to their resources.
    
He regretted that Pakistanis, as a nation were prodigal, a tendency which, 
he pointed out, the national economy could not afford and Islam and 
collective justice did not permit.
    
Addressing the ceremony at which he administered oath to the new governing 
body of the Lahore Press Club on Wednesday, the president said Pakistan 
could not afford slightest negligence in defence or reduction in the 
defence expenditure, still the government should prepare such economic 
policies as could lower the burden on the common man.
    
I generally agree with the criticism that the rulers, including myself, 
and the elected representatives are not ready to adjust their living 
standards according to the economic conditions of the country.
    
He advised the people from all walks of life to pay their taxes honestly. 
The agriculture sector should also pay reasonable tax and the traders and 
industrialists should file their returns honestly.
    
President Leghari regretted that although tax culture was non-existent in 
Pakistan, the people should pay their due share to enable the government to 
make the country a welfare state. When the country will have enough 
resources, higher allocations for various sectors will become possible for 
the government.
    
Urging the rulers as well as the moneyed people to lead austere lives, the 
president deplored that as a nation Pakistanis were wasteful.

<a name="m11d">M-11 deployment may lead to sanctions on China: US</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, June 13: The Clinton administration will impose sanctions on 
China if nuclear-capable M-11 missiles sold to Pakistan are deployed, and 
it is already investigating new information about the missiles, the State 
Department said.

On Capitol Hill, Sen. Larry E. Pressler urged President Clinton to impose 
sanctions on China and halt a one-time transfer of US military equipment to 
Pakistan approved by Congress last year.
    
South Asia is known as the worlds most unstable region. Now, thanks to 
illegal activity involving China and Pakistan, it is even more unstable, 
the South Dakota Republican said.
    
Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations 
Committee, said the M-11 deployment is a cause for concern but the 
administration effort to water down the intelligence about the missiles 
is more ominous.
    
Skewing intelligence information for political purposes is not only 
outrageous, it can be downright dangerous to the health of out national 
security, the New York Republican said.

Mr Burns said the administration is evaluating information on the M-11s, 
which he said is a complex issue. The complexity concerns the information 
that you get, whether that information is credible information. And its a 
laborious, painstaking, detailed process to make a determination like 
this, he said.
    
The administration will not shy away from declaring the missiles deployed 
if the evidence leads to that, he said. So far, he stresses, we have not 
made a determination that either China or Pakistan have engaged in activity 
that would be sanctionable through the transfer of missiles from China to 
Pakistan.
    
Mr Burns refused to comment on whether the State Departments intelligence 
bureau is trying to water down recent US intelligence community reports 
declaring the M-11 missiles in Pakistan to be operational.
    
But the spokesman criticised what he said were leaks of highly classified, 
sensitive intelligence information related to M-11 issue. He called the 
leaks unlawful and unethical.

<a name="npro">N-programme not frozen: Nasrullah</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

LAHORE, June 15: Pakistan has acquired nuclear capability and it has 
neither capped nor frozen its nuclear programme, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, 
chairman of the Kashmir Committees of the National Assembly, said.
    
Speaking at a meeting of Kashmiri and Pakistani intellectuals called by the 
committee at a local hotel, he said that Pakistan cannot compete with India 
in conventional arms, and nuclear capability was the only deterrent which 
had prevented India from attacking Pakistan.
    
He also said nuclear capability once acquired cannot be rolled back.
    
Nasrullah was of the view that now that Pakistan had acquired nuclear 
capability, it should not say that it would sign NPT if India signed it. He 
said India was interfering in the internal affairs of all its neighbours in 
an effort to dominate them. The only country which was resisting India was 
Pakistan.
    
Nasrullah said the solution of the Kashmir issue lay in the complete unity 
of the people of Pakistan. Let us put our own house in order and focus all 
our efforts and energies upon solving the issue.

<a name="pmse">PM seeks unconditional talks with opposition</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 13: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto offered opposition to 
hold unconditional talks with the government on the basis of give-and-take 
instead of imposing pre-conditions for a dialogue on national issues.
    
Talking to reporters in her assembly chamber after the budget speech, the 
prime minister said pre-conditionalities would create hurdles in initiating 
any such parleys.
    
There should be some give-and-take by the two sides instead of taking 
rigid stands, she added.
    
The prime minister said the opposition wanted talks only on issues which 
benefit them but not on other issues which were vital for the nation. They 
should tell us what they were ready to give to the nation, she said adding 
that there were issues like the restoration of women and minorities seats 
in the assemblies, repeal of controversial 8th amendment, electoral and 
judicial reforms and appointment of a Chief Election Commissioner with the 
consultation of the opposition leader. Government wanted all these issues 
to be discussed with the opposition.
    
Ms Bhutto noted that now the opposition was demanding formation of a 
commission for accountability to delay the corruption cases being faced by 
the opposition leader in the courts. She said: whenever an issue has to be 
covered up a commission is formed. She recalled the Hamoordur Rehman 
Commission, Lone Commission and Mehran Bank Commissions which, she said, 
were used only as a cover to pacify the people though nothing came out of 
them.
    
If they want a commission, they will have to tell what they are ready to 
give to the people in exchange, she added.
    
Referring to the opposition demand of forming an interim government for 
holding fresh elections, the prime minister regretted that politicians were 
bringing bad name to their own breed.
    
Why should politicians say that a judge should be appointed or an interim 
government be formed? she asked and added that the opposition had even 
refused to accept the result of the elections held by the caretaker 
government of Moeen Qureshi in which she had been elected for five years.

<a name="expr">Express set to publish Surrey house photos</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Athar Ali

LONDON, June 15: The Sunday Express, which last week revealed that a large 
house built with a landing strip and indoor swimming pool with 355 acres of 
surrounding parkland in Surrey, in South of England, has been purchased for 
the Bhuttos, has in the latest issue, just ready to go on the news stands, 
published photographs of the manor with some other details which the paper 
says reinforce their story.
    
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto strongly denied the report when it first 
appeared and was also carried by the Pakistan media. Her husband Mr Asif 
Zardari said it was an effort to malign the family and that he was 
consulting his lawyers with the intention of suing the Sunday Express.
    
The newspaper says that the property was purchased in October last year in 
the name of a company registered in the Isle of Man, an offshore British 
crown dependency. The Sunday Express claims that Mr Asif Zardari is behind 
the purchase and they are not revealing all the details in their latest 
issue as they wish to keep some information with them in case Mr Zardari 
decides to file a libel writ against them.
    
The paper, however, said security arrangements made at the manor, which has 
a high boundary wall around it, have been approved by Mr Zardari. These are 
linked to Scotland Yard and have been confirmed by them to the Sunday 
Express. The paper has said that eight crates sent from the Zardari home. 
Bilawal House in Karachi, arrived on a PIA flight last month addressed to 
the Pakistan High Commissioner, Mr Wajid Shamsul Hasan. He is reply to 
newspaper queries had on May 27 said that these were gifts which arrived 
from the Prime Minister from time and time and also included mangoes meant 
for distribution to her friends.
    
These goods were marked as personal effects and, the airway bill showed, 
were sent by PIA free of charge. But the Sunday Express says these 
contained guns and antiques for decoration and were meant for the house in 
Surrey. The paper quotes the Pakistan High Commissions information 
minister, Kamran Shafi, as now admitting that these crates contained guns, 
which are not serviceable and only antiques. These were received by the 
High Commission. 
    
The Sunday Express has also revealed that Mr Hakim Ali Zardari has also 
purchased an apartment in Belgravia, an expensive London locality close to 
the Pakistan High Commission. But Mr Zardari senior was reported by the 
paper to be in France and could not be contacted. The pandemonium which 
the story  appearing in the Sunday Express has caused in Pakistan, has also 
been commented on by the weekly Economist. The story, the weekly says, has 
caused a stir because government and opposition politicians in Pakistan 
have recently spent much energy in trading allegations of corruption. The 
Sunday Express story, the Economist says is highly embarrassing for the 
Prime Minister.

<a name="mqmp">MQM plans mass protest</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, June 16: The Opposition MPAs belonging to the MQM in the Sindh 
Assembly on Sunday rejected the budget for fiscal 1996- 97 and decided to 
mobilise people to launch a protest campaign against "gross injustice" 
meted out to the urban areas of the province.
    
"The figures provided in the budget are, in fact, a kind of camouflage as 
the amount of real new taxes will be to the tune of Rs 2 billion, not Rs 
900 million as claimed by the government," stated the Leader of the 
Opposition in the Sindh Assembly, Dr Farooq Sattar, at his assembly 
chamber.
    
During the fiscal 1994-95 and 1995-96 additional taxes levied in Sindh 
amounted to Rs 2 billion and Rs 1.5 billion, respectively, against the 
government's original target of Rs 310 million and Rs 150 million, he said, 
adding the taxes generated through the increase on excise, stamps, motor 
vehicles and registration and transfer fees to meet the shortfall would add 
to the economic miseries of the people in urban areas.
    
Disputing the number of development schemes as described in the budget 
speech, he said during the last fiscal year work was done on hardly 50 
development schemes.
    
As far as the urban areas were concerned, he said, 80 per cent of the 
schemes had remained totally unattended, and on the remaining schemes only 
20 per cent work was carried out.

As far as the MQM was concerned, he said, his party had always been 
advocating for the due share of the province, he said, adding during the 
government of Jam Sadiq Ali and before under the Karachi Accord the MQM 
always demanded just share of province in the federal divisible pool.

<a name="mqmm">MQM may boycott LB polls: Dehlavi</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

LONDON, June 17: If the Mohajir Qaumi Movement continues to be victimised 
and targeted allegedly by the government, it may boycott the local bodies 
elections being promised for this year.
    
This was stated by Ajmal Dehlavi, MQMs chief negotiator, who is in London 
for consultations.
    
MQM leader Altaf Hussain in his speech urged the chief of army staff to 
remove the chasm that had developed since the operation June 1992 army 
during which, he added, his party became the main target. He said those who 
had conspired to create the gulf and damage the armys image ought to be 
punished.

The MQM, said Mr Dehlavi, was being made the target for trying to bring 
about a change in society controlled by a mafia consisting of feudal 
lords and bureaucrats. This class, he added, formed only two per cent of 
the population but rule the rest of the 98 per cent of the population. 
    
He claimed that 17,000 Mohajirs had been killed and nearly 500,000 had 
experienced torture, harassment and arrest. There was hardly any locality 
in urban Sindh where death from violence had not occurred.
    
The negotiations with the government to resolve the problem in urban Sindh 
got bogged down because of their refusal to implement the 10-point 
agreement reached with the MQM in 1994, said Mr Dehlavi. About the local 
bodies elections, the MQMs condition for participation would be that 
repression must end and victimisation and extra-judicial killings of MQM 
workers must stop.

<a name="free">Freed peasants demand action against landlord</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

HYDERABAD, June 17: Seven peasants, including three women, who were rescued 
from the private jail of landlord Mohammad Hayyat Rind of Mithi district, 
along with 64 other bonded peasants by the district administration at the 
instance of the HRCP special task force, Sindh, about ten day back, have 
demanded legal action against the landlord and his managers.
    
Talking to Dawn, Goven Bheel, Ghuneso Bheel, Mangal Bheel, Kheto Bheel, 
Siddi wife of Gullu, Haleema wife of Ghuneso and Geni wife of Mangal said 
that 70 persons including women and children had been kept in wrongful 
confinement by wadera Mohammad Hayyat Rind for 15 long years.
    
They alleged that they were paid no compensation for their manual labour 
nor share from agricultural produce adding that they were given only wheat 
flour as subsistence.
    
They complained that armed guards were posted to supervise their work and 
to see to it that no bonded hari escaped from the private jail. They said 
Hayyat Tangri and his son Ibrahim Tangri, the manager of the wadera, 
maintained a strict watch over the prisoners.

Answering a question, the liberated haris said that they were happy now and 
working on daily wage basis.
    
They, however, said that they had spent 15 precious year of their life in 
wrongful confinement for no fault of their and demanded that wadera Hayyat 
Rind should be prosecuted and made to pay 15 years compensation to the 
haris.
    
Answering another question they said that they were made to sign on some 
papers but they did not know about the contents of the documents. The co-
ordinator HRCP special task force for Sindh, Mr Shakeel Pathan, who was 
instrumental in the release of the bonded haris, called upon the government 
to rehabilitate all the liberated haris on permanent basis.

<a name="heat">Heatwave toll rises to 36 in city</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, June 19: At least 11 more people died in different city hospitals 
due to persistent heatwave on Wednesday while another one expired late 
Tuesday evening in the CHK, bringing the death toll to 36 in three days.
    
Besides, many others suffering from heat-related illnesses were brought in 
critical condition to hospitals.

Doctors said patients reported to different city hospitals were mainly 
elderly and those having pre-disposing illnesses, or those who were 
chronically ill.
    
Owing to this high rate of deaths because of the harsh weather, doctors 
have advised people that they must wear light clothing, ensure sufficient 
intake of fluids, use umbrellas and avoid heat exposure.
    
However, a number of attendants accompanying patients told doctors that 
even the patients who had not gone outside and remained indoors the entire 
day, also suffered from the heat effects and developed hyperpyrexia. Three 
patients in the intensive care unit of the Medical-IV of the CHK and living 
in hygienic and cool environment were among those who developed high-grade 
fever.

<a name="worl">World Bank cuts aid by half </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, June 18: The World Bank has cut Pakistans assistance to almost 
half despite the implementation of most of its conditionalities and the 
prescriptions of the IMF in 1996-97 budget.
    
Informed sources said that Pakistan had been offered only $433 million 
during the fiscal ending June 30 against $946 million of 1994-95.
    
Pakistan was expecting to have its World Bank lending level increased from 
$946 million to $1 billion during the current financial year.

The issue had been discussed between Ms Meiko Nishimizu, director of the 
South Asia department at Washington, during her current visit to Pakistan, 
and the high authorities here, including Prime Ministers Adviser on 
Finance V.A. Jafarey, but without any result.
    
Dawn tried to contact Ms Nishimizu many a time but was told every time that 
she was too busy. This was perhaps the first time that any bank official 
avoided to meet a reporter despite the banks policy of openness and access 
of information to everyone.

<a name="masd">NASDAQ team reviews bourses operation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, June 19: A four-member team of experts led by Mr Robert N. 
Reiss, Managing Director of NASDAQ, high profile computerised stock 
exchange based in New York has undertaken a review of the regulatory system 
and operations of the three stock exchanges of Pakistan.
    
Part of the Asian Development Bank-assisted Capital Market Development 
Project for Pakistan, the review will be the basis of comprehensive 
proposals for bringing the stock exchanges at par with the developed 
securities markets in the country particularly in terms of openness, 
fairness, liquidity etc., Corporate Law Authority Chairman Khalil Masud 
said.
    
The very fact that no less a person than head of NASDAQ (National 
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System), reputed for 
its transparent and easy operation, came here for starting the project 
indicated the future potential of Pakistan as an emerging market, Mr Masud 
remarked.
    
Mr Reiss, head of the Project and Mr Jalil, Chairman, Aries Group Ltd, have 
gone back after holding discussions with the CLA Chairman and other 
authorities. They were also provided with the report prepared recently by 
CLA about the stock exchanges of Lahore and Islamabad. The other members 
are now busy  studying the operation of Karachi Stock Exchange.
    
The project has been launched at the request of the Government of Pakistan 
for technical assistance in further improving the capital market, 
particularly, in view of the constant fluctuations capital market has 
suffered over the past couple of years. There has been the suspicion that a 
handful of operators have been trying to manipulate the markets. 
Notwithstanding these highs and troughs, the CLA Chairman said he had met 
during a recent meeting of the International Emerging Markets Committee in 
Warsaw (Poland) well-known financial wizards including Dr Mark Mobius, who 
operates an $8 billion fund, had expressed keen interest in the 
developments in Pakistans stock market. Dr Mobius was one of the leading 
operators who had continued to replenish their stock in Pakistan over the 
past three years.
    
Mr Masud noted, nevertheless, that foreign investment had grown at the rate 
of $one billion dollars per annum during the last three years, although the 
investment in emerging markets had multiplied from $185 billion to $205 
billion between 1994 and 1995. The prospect of Pakistan increasing its 
share of these inflows depended on reduction in budget deficit and 
inflation, he stressed.

<a name="budg">Budget tougher than expected</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporters

KARACHI, June 13: Calling it IMF inspired and tough beyond tolerance 
level, economists and business leaders believe that heavy tax loaded 
budget for 1996-97 presented by the State Finance Minister Makhdoom 
Shahabuddin is bound to trigger off a new wave of price spiral.
    
Makhdooms budget is bound to escalate prices by 8 to 10 per cent across 
the board, is the spontaneous comment of a number of businessmen on the Rs 
40.8 billion additional taxation measures. They, however, do not want to be 
identified because of their honey mooning with the government.
    
Businessmen looked jittery but were reluctant to offer on the record 
comments. Views offered by them vary. One section of businessmen believe 
that the government has no option but to follow the course chartered by the 
IMF experts for the debt ridden Pakistan and Prime Minister was herself 
more than candid to inform the people at least a week in advance on what 
was in store for them.

Businessmen are angry because feudals have been spared of all taxation on 
their incomes despite the fact that in 1995-96 they harvested bumper cotton 
and wheat crops and earned Rs 50 billion. While industry and trade has been 
subjected to heavy taxation by withdrawing all exemption from sales tax and 
raising the rate to 18 per cent from 15 per cent, the governments proposal 
to bring in fold of taxation, allowances of fixed salary earners will 
reduce the purchasing power and eventually result in shrinkage of market 
for the industrialists and traders.

<a name="sala">Salaried class to be hardest hit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 13: President of Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industry Mr 
Tariq Ikram termed the budget inflationary in nature. Talking to Dawn he 
said: Budget is likely to be inflationary in nature since the sales tax 
net is being expanded...regulatory duty has not been withdrawn and 
progressive reduction on import duties is not being made.
    
Mr Ikram felt the increase in the level of sales tax is likely to reduce 
the pace of GDP growth and that of the economy of Pakistan. He said the 
levy of taxation on salaried class by adding back perquisites without any 
relief in the tax level will significantly hurt the already burdened 
salaried tax-payers.
    
The measures to increase revenue from agricultural income are most 
disappointing inspite of the increase in the PIU price, he said. The OICCI 
chief lamented the absence of any incentives to increase in the number of 
the tax assesses. Insufficient attention to the need for reduction in the 
cost of national administration and improving efficiency is also 
disappointing, he said.
    
Mr Ikram lauded the setting up of the fiscal anomalies committee and the 
exemption of sales tax on exports.

<a name="with">Withdrawal of tax exemptions from employees slated</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, June 15: The withdrawal of tax exemptions from the corporate 
employees is likely to cause one of the worst brain-drain in the country as 
no one would like to pay tax on their gross income at the rate of 60 %.
    
It is a gross discrimination against a sector, which is an honest tax-
payer, said an executive of a top company.
    
We have yet to understand as to why the Central Board of Revenue is bent 
upon destroying the corporate sector, which is the most documented sector 
in the country, he added.
    
The Finance Bill 1996 has proposed that exemptions available to corporate 
employees in the form of house rent allowance (45%) and other types of 
accommodation, all types of conveyance allowances, concessional passage for 
travel, entertainment allowance and other benefits be withdrawn.
    
Mr Younus Rizwani Sheikh, former Tax Bar president and an Income Tax 
practitioner, while giving his assessment over the proposed withdrawal of 
tax exemption on perquisites of corporate employees, said: By very 
conservative estimates, these employees will be required to pay 50 to 60 % 
more taxes then they paid last year even if their emoluments remain 
unchanged.

He said the worst victims of the Finance Bill 1996 are the employees of 
companies as defined in Section 2(16). The effect of this proposed change 
in rules, he said, is that the employees of these companies will no longer 
be entitled to tax free incidental benefits attached to their employment 
except utilities and will have to pay tax on their gross income.

<a name="addi">Additional taxes of Rs41bn; GST net widened</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, June 13: The Minister of State for  Finance, Makhdoom 
Shahabuddin, presented a seemingly IMF- inspired reformist, but otherwise a 
highly inflationary budget with a total outlay of a little over Rs. 500 
billion, showing a massive gap of Rs. 160 billion proposed to be bridged 
with about Rs.41 billion of additional taxation and the rest through 
deficit financing amounting to about Rs. 120 billion, including Rs. 20 
billion of bank borrowing.
    
Tough on the middle and low income groups, especially the salaried classes 
which have lost their income tax exemptions on expenditures on 
entertainment, cars and house rent as well, the budget for the next year 
envisages withdrawal of Sales Tax exemptions from all items except on five 
at the import and manufacturing stages while at the same time increasing 
the rates from 15 to 18 per cent and from 20 per cent to 23 per cent.
    
The five exempted items which would continue to enjoy Sales Tax exemption 
include sugar, edible oil,  petroleum products, processed food items and 
agriculture produce. Essential items, such as medicines and raw material 
for fertilisers will be subjected to a rate of five per cent.
    
Central Excise tax has been enhanced on telephone services (40 per cent), 
cement (35 per cent ), arms and ammunition, beverages, cigarettes and some 
selected services the details of which were not immediately available.
    
Pleading that the budget deficit reduction was a more urgent task than 
tariff reforms, the minister announced that 10 per cent regulatory duty on 
imports imposed in October last year would continue and the maximum tariff 
would continue to remain pegged to 65 per cent.
    
Capital Value Tax has been extended to purchase of larger agricultural 
lands, bigger flats, foreign air travel and certain motor vehicles plying 
for hire.
    
The valuation of agricultural land for wealth tax purposes has been 
increased from Rs. 250 PIU to Rs. 400 PIU and exemptions in respect of 
houses, will be restricted to only one house, irrespective of number of 
holdings.

Foreign travel tax has been revised upward to Rs. 1000 per ticket for all 
foreign travel originating from Pakistan and exemption allowed on PTA 
tickets has been withdrawn.
    
It has been decided to discontinue the system of tax holidays for industry 
and replace it, where necessary, with tax credit schemes.  

As a result of new proposals, the government hopes to earn additional Rs. 
7.6 billion from Customs, Rs. 2.5 billion from Income Tax, Rs. 2.9 billion 
from Central Excise and Rs.13.5 billion from Sales Tax.

<a name="econ">Economic Survey presents a sketchy picture of the economy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

THE ECONOMIC SURVEY of PAKISTAN for 1995-96 presents largely a sketchy 
picture of the current state of the economy making it almost impossible for 
one to know exactly what is wrong with it or to pinpoint the causes for the 
mess.
    
Take for example, the figure of overall growth rate. It is recorded as 6.1 
per cent. But this jump in the growth rate from the previous years 4.8 per 
cent seems plausible only if seen in the context of a dramatic jump in the 
cotton crop production. Otherwise, most other factors that contribute to 
growth rate have shown improvement only on paper except of course 
consumptive imports and non-development expenditures( the increases which 
greatly expand the budgetary and trade account deficits) which galloped 
away as if tomorrow will never come.
    
Those who live in this country have never known to have accepted the 
official inflation figures. Still, the 10.5 per cent of inflation as 
recorded by the Economic Survey for 1995-96 is too insulting to the 
intelligence of even the most gullible of our teeming millions groaning 
under the ever increasing administered prices and ever galloping 
infrastructure tariffs.
     
Hiding facts
    
The chapter on balance of payments is a transparent exercise in hiding 
facts behind verbiage. Nowhere do the authors of the Survey identify, and 
even attempt to identify, the reasons why exports grew at the rate of less 
than six percent against the budgetary estimates of 15 per cent and why 
imports shot up by 17 per cent against the target of 10 per cent.
    
The latest figures for foreign trade for the eleventh month present an 
extremely panicky picture of a $ 3 billion dollar deficit. Exports during 
this period grew by only 5.84 per cent at $ 7.56 billion. There are strong 
indications that exports during the year ending June 30, 1996, would not 
fetch more than $ 8.4 billion against the budgetary estimates of $ 9.2 
billion.
    
Imports during the first 11 months cost the country over $ 11.5 billion. 
This figure is expected to go up by another billion dollars by the end of 
June 30, 1996.
    
Ironically this year the import bill has sky-rocketed not because of an 
increase in machinery imports but because of a steep rise in the import of 
consumption items like edible oil, wheat, tea, powdered milk, pulses, sugar 
and betel nuts. Machinery imports worth $ 2.21 billion show an 
insignificant growth of 6 per cent.
    
Nowhere in this chapter do the authors admit that the stagnation in 
exports, despite the 7 per cent devaluation in October 1995 and further 
crawling devaluation in the subsequent months of about another 7 per cent, 
was caused by official polices which discouraged exports.
    
Neither do they admit that despite the imposition of 10 per cent regulatory 
duties in October 1995, the government failed to improve its revenue 
collection from the customs because of lower imports of dutiable items in 
this period because of which it had to dip its hands into the duty-drawback 
kitty to the tune of over Rs 8 billion which in turn caused a liquidity 
crunch in the manufactured export sector, thereby bringing down export 
growth almost to a crawl.

Fudging figures
    
And it is also well-known how the ministry has managed to pull the wool 
over the eyes of the nation and the IMF by fudging the bank borrowing 
figures at the end of each quarter.
    
In this backdrop the claim of achieving overall budgetary deficit of 5 per 
cent of GDP for the whole year appears too tall to fit the low cunning of 
the countrys finance bureaucracy.
    
The actual bank borrowing for budgetary support by the end of June 30, is 
likely to be nearer Rs 100 billion against the Rs 29 billion fixed for the 
whole year. This was, again the amount shown to have been borrowed from 
banks for budgetary support up to March 31, 1996 through window dressing 
and creative accounting in order to claim a 5 per cent overall budgetary 
deficit for the entire year while in actual fact the borrowing by that time 
(March 31, 1996) had gone beyond Rs 68 billion.
    
Most of the additional bank borrowing for budgetary support, for the time 
being, is expected to be swept behind window-dressing and a significant 
part of this borrowing is also likely to be delayed until after the end of 
the current financial year in order to be able to keep the current years 
books in order.
    
But then, have these official economic managers any idea how much 
distortion they would be guilty of causing in the economy. And what about 
the delayed impact of such a huge budgetary deficit on the general price 
line? Probably, they are thinking that they would not be around when the 
prices hit the ceiling. Perhaps they are right.
    
But is it fair for a handful few to play with the economic fate of a nation 
just because there is no tradition of accountability in this country? In 
fact this fact should have been reason enough for all those who are 
officially assigned the responsibility of managing our economy to show more 
sensitivity and more care while spending the national resources.
    
In order to understand what is being hinted at, one need only to have to 
refer to the piles and piles of reports published since 1985 by successive 
Public Accounts Committees of the National Assembly.
    
These reports make it abundantly clear the fact that billions of rupees 
disappear from the official kitty every year from each and every department 
for which no one has so far been held responsible because either they have 
retired or have been transferred far away from the scene of crime.
    
It is rather interesting to observe the walk through the dark alley which 
each budget takes until rather belatedly the beans are spilled by the 
Public Accounts Committee.
    
First, the budget is presented for the coming 12 months and promises are 
made by the government to collect the targeted revenue and to keep the non- 
development expenditures within the limit. Next, in the din of the next 
years budget announcement, a supplementary budget for the outgoing year is 
presented and got passed by the National Assembly soon after the next 
years budget is passed. In the confusion nobody attempts to question why 
there were massive shortfalls both in the collection and expenditure 
targets fixed in the budget for the outgoing year.
    
It takes about five months more for the preliminary audit report for the 
previous year to be presented to the government. And by this time the glare 
of spotlight is on the current budget rather than what happened during the 
remote months of the previous year. And then it takes another three years 
for the Public Accounts Committee to present its department-wise report for 
that particular year. By this time these reports assume the form of 
historical documents about another world, of another century, to be filed 
away and forgotten.

<a name="2bnd">$2bn deficit likely in foreign trade</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, June 16: The Trade Policy for 1996-97 to be announced by the 
federal commerce ministry towards the end of this month would set targets 
of around $10 billion for exports and $12 billion for imports, making for a 
trade deficit of over $2 billion, according to an official source.
    
As the invisibles balance, which will continue to be governed largely by 
the behaviour of the workers' remittances, is expected to rise further to 
$1.06 billion, the current account deficit may stand at $3.06 billion, that 
is equivalent to 4.4 per cent of the GDP. This is, however, considerably 
lower than $3.64 billion, the current account deficit during 1995-96, 
according to the Planning Commission document Annual Plan 1996-97 relating 
to Economic Framework and Public Sector Development Programme.
    
On the basis of monthly average of $0.681 billion for exports during first 
11 months of 1995-96, the export target envisaging $0.830 billion may be 
too ambitious. However, authors of the document expect the growth of 
exports during the next financial year to be 14.4 per cent.

Imports are projected to increase by 5.3 per cent, "assuming some stability 
in prices for key imports like crude oil and edible oils as well as 
reduction in import quantum of wheat and sugar in view of increased 
domestic production".

Based on the situation in the current financial year, the workers' 
remittances are projected at $1.57 billion, slightly more than in the 
current financial year.

<a name="sell">Sellers stay away owing to new fiscal steps</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, June 13: Stocks turned in a relatively improved performance in the 
pre-budget session as sellers kept to the sidelines owing to some positive 
feelers about the fiscal measures from Islamabad.
    
The KSE 100-share index fell 1.59 points to 1,704.99 and did not breach the 
psychological barrier of 1,700 points as widely speculated and stood firm 
at 1,704.99 as compared to 1,706.58 a day earlier, reflecting the relative 
strength of the base shares.
    
The interesting feature was that unlike previous session, there was no 
massive selling as bears stayed away apparently awaiting the details of the 
Federal Budget.

They said direction of the market is expected to be set by the fiscal 
steps, notably the demands of the Karachi Stock Exchange in respect of tax 
relief on income on bonus shares and tax exemption for the insurance sector 
on its investment.

But there are already some indications of relief well-reflected in big 
gains in some of the shares. A big fresh rise of Rs 20 in Siemens, which 
has lifted its share value by about Rs 40 during the week indicated that 
the engineering sector is going to be benefited from the tax incentives.
    
An identical increase in price of Nestle Milkpak was also reflective of 
some positive news from Islamabad, dealers said.
    
As a whole the pre-budget performance of the market was not that bad as 
gainers, which have trailing far behind losers cut short lead and about 
evenly matched.
    
Apart from Siemens and Nestle Milkpak, which rose sharply, the other good 
gainers were led by Adamjee Insurance which rose by Rs 5 on expectations of 
tax exemption followed by Javed Omer, Al-Abid Silk and some others, rising 
by Rs 1.5 to 2.
    
Rafhan Maize, BOC Pakistan, Honda Atlas, Hinopak Motors, Bata Pakistan, 
Trust Leasing, Maple Leaf Cement and Alico also rose but modestly on active 
follow-up support.
    
Energy shares fell under the lead of Shell Pakistan(r), Attock Refinery, 
Pakistan Refinery apparently in response to cut in petroleum prices, 
falling by one rupee to Rs 2.
    
Some of the MNCs, which suffered decline included Engro Chemicals, Parke-
Davis, Brooke Bond and Lever Brothers also suffered fall on renewed 
selling.
    
But the biggest decline was noted in National Fibre, which fell by Rs 8 on 
active selling but no buyers at the falling prices.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, lower 30 paisa on 7.665m, 
followed by Hub-Power, off 55 paisa on 6.854m, Dewan Salman, easy 80 paisa 
on 1.059m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, steady 15 paisa on 0.890m, Lucky Cement, 
higher 30 paisa on 0.561m, LTV Modaraba, firm 10 paisa on 0.386m, NDLC, up 
20 paisa on 0.486m, Dhan Fibre, up 35 paisa on 0.226m and ICI Pakistan, up 
25 paisa on 0.116m shares.
    
Trading volume fell to 20.354m shares as compared to 49m shares a day 
earlier owing to the absence of leading sellers.
    
There were 331 actives, out of which 135 shares fell, while 128 rose, with 
68 holding on to the last levels

<a name="blue">Blue chips show fresh smart rallies</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, June 19: Stocks extended the overnight recovery as blue chips 
showed fresh smart rallies followed by active short-covering at the lower 
levels.
    
The markets firm stance was also evident in a big fresh increase of 26.81 
points or 1.60 per cent in the KSE 100-share index, which was close to 
attain its resistance level of 1,700-point and missed it marginally.
    
It was last quoted at 1,699.64 as compared to 1,672.83 a day earlier, 
reflecting the strength of base shares.
    
Its opening itself was fairly promising as the rings were flooded with 
buying orders, notably on the blue chips counters and there was massive 
buying on some of the selected counters.
    
Bulk of the support, however, remained again centred around PTC vouchers 
which crossed the psychological barrier of Rs 40 and was last quoted around 
Rs 41.10, indicating that it could attain its prereaction level of Rs 45.50 
during the next few sessions. It alone accounted for more than a half of 
the total volume.
    
Elsewhere, there were more buyers than sellers as those who had bought at 
the higher levels were not inclined to sell until prices reached their 
target.
    
Analysts said the market has recovered broadly during the last three 
sessions but investors still doubt its ability to sustain the run-up.
    
There is a loud whispering in the rings that rally is largely inspired to 
demonstrate that the market reaction to the budget is positive, although it 
is belated one, some analysts said.
    
But some others were of the opinion that instances of genuine buying 
support were also there as those sectors, which are to be benefited by some 
of the budgetary steps came in for active short-covering at the lower level 
and triggered sympathetic support on other counters.
    
Some of the dividend coming even from the badly hit sectors, notably 
modarabas and banks, also encouraged investors to be back in the rings.
    
An interim dividend of 15 per cent by Leather-Up was, therefore, well 
received in the rings as it reflected a major change in the sponsors 
perceptions.
    
The important thing is that it came at the time when the rally on stock 
market was still in a formative stage and economy and exports are yet to 
pick up to a desired level.
    
It was perhaps in this background that the market witnessed some of the 
best gains in the recent past on sustained and widespread support.
    
Pharma shares continued to attract good support despite tax on raw 
materials apparently on the perception that sales tax could boost their 
earnings.
    
Wellcome Pakistan, which spurted by Rs 15 led the list followed by Ciba-
Geigy and some others, which also finished with an extended gain of Rs 10.
    
Other big gainers were led by Attock Refinery, 4ht ICP, Siemens Pakistan, 
International Industries and Al-Abid Silk, which pushed their prices higher 
by Rs 5 to 12.
    
Pivotals such as Adamjee Insurance, Engro Chemicals, Fauji Fertiliser, 
Hoechst Pakistan, Nestle Milkpak Shell Pakistan and PSO, which rose by Rs 
10 were among the other major gainers.
    
Barring a sharp decline of Rs 7 in Brooke Bond for not any adverse news, 
losses on the other hand were mostly fractional and reflected lack of 
support rather large selling.
    
Grindlays Modaraba, Askari Leasing, Bank al-Habib, Pakistan Refinery and 
Wyeth Lab were among the other losers.
    
PTC vouchers again topped the list of most actives, up Rs 1.10 on 18.443m, 
Hub-Power, firm 50 paisa on 3.862m, Dewan Salman, off 90 paisa on 1.365m, 
FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, on 1.222m, Lucky Cement, lower 65 paisa on 0.666m, 
Sui Northern, up 50 paisa on 0.363m, D.G.Khan Cement, up 65 paisa on 
0.378m, and Faysal Bank up 45 paisa on 0.295m shares. There were some other 
notable deals also.
    
Trading volume fell to 30.023m shares from the overnight 34.653m shares 
owing to the absence of leading sellers.
    
There were 347 actives, out of which 140 shares fell, while 116 rose, with 
91 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="prem">Premeditated murder</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

ON THE afternoon of Monday June 10 Nizam Ahmed, a senior advocate of the 
Supreme Court and a former additional judge of the Sindh High Court, and 
his 27-year-old son Nadeem were gunned down as their car (driven by the 
young man) was turning into the gate of their PECHS home. It was a good, 
clean professional job.
    
Members of the legal fraternity and the concerned people of Karachi are of 
the firm belief that Nizams murder was politically motivated, executed 
under instructions from one of the many violent factions operating in the 
country  an agency, Al-Zulfikar, Altafs MQM, the Haqiqi MQM, the PPP, 
or some other deranged or vindictive high-up.
    
Nizam, who I knew, was a most pleasant man, a man of conviction, a good 
advocate who spoke his mind, a reliable member and a vociferous office-
bearer of the Bar Council and Bar Associations; his head and heart were in 
the right place, and he espoused the cause of an independent judiciary. In 
the recent Judges Case he did what he could to help the judges unite and 
stand firm in the face of threats. He spent much of his professional time 
on public interest litigation and fought many a case pro bono publico 
against land-grabbers, against the usurpation of the peoples land by 
powerful high-ups, and, of course, against any violations of human 
rights. At the time of his murder, he was involved in pleading the cause of 
many an affected citizen.
    
Informed circles are of the considered opinion that Nizams murder was 
committed to convey a message to the legal fraternity and the now assertive 
judiciary, which includes his brother-in- law, that independent relief-
giving judge of our Supreme Court, Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid.
    
Nizam will always be remembered with gratitude for the pains he took, 
whilst a judge of the Sindh High Court, to relieve the lot of the inmates 
of our prisons. His judgement delivered on the use of barfetters and on the 
generally deplorable conditions in our jails will shine for ever.
    
In July 1989, Justice Ajmal Mian, the strong Chief Justice of the High 
Court of Sindh, visited the jail at Landhi. What he saw appalled him, and, 
as a consequence, the judges of his High Court made a suo moto reference 
(Cr. Misc. Application 245/89) on the subject of inhuman jail conditions. 
the court invited advocate Sabihuddin Ahmad and Barrister Makhdoom Ali Khan 
as amicus curiae. In January 1993, eighteen judges of the High Court led by 
Chief Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid inspected the Central Prison in Karachi. 
Strangely, they were not shown round the Security and Bund Wards. So, 
in February 1993, Justice Nizam Ahmad was deputed to specifically inspect 
these two hell-holes.
    
In December 1993, it was Nizam, sitting with Justice Hyder Ali Pirzada, who 
wrote the judgement in this matter, from which I now quote:
    
During the inspection, it was noticed that the condition of most of the 
prisoners who were kept in Security / Bund wards was pathetic and pitiable. 
The manner in which they were kept was against the dignity of a human 
being. Many of them were kept in a cell, having an area of a few square 
feet, in solitary confinement with bar-fetters on. If a comparison of the 
conditions of these prisoners is possible, then it can only be made with 
the animals who are kept in a zoo. It can be said without any hesitation 
that even the animals in the zoo are better placed as they have no bar-
fetters inside their cages and they are provided with better facilities. 
Most of the prisoners complained that they were kept inside the cell for 
several days with bar-fetters and were taken out only once a week for a 
bath. Otherwise they had to eat, drink, sleep and relieve themselves in the 
cell in the presence of other prisoners and had to perform all other daily 
routines inside their small cells, some of which even do not have the 
facility of direct sunlight...
    
He posed the questions: Whether bar-fetters can be applied merely on the 
ground that an accused is facing trial in court cases involving serious 
offences without any previous conviction, and without his having committed 
any disorderly act in the jail, and whether the bar-fetters can be 
applied for indefinite periods, namely from the date of entry until the 
conclusion of the trial or thereafter.
    
These questions wee answered by numerous examples of case law pertaining to 
the Indian courts, all of which clearly show that imposition of bar-
fetters has been treated as violating human dignity. It may also be 
pertinent to keep in view that the Indian Constitution does not guarantee 
the dignity of man as a fundamental right and this right was guaranteed in 
our Constitution for the first time in 1973. It is perhaps for this reason 
that the Indian Courts were not able to strike down imposition of fetters 
in all circumstances. Nevertheless, relying upon Article 14 (equal 
protection of laws), Article 19 (freedom of movement) and Article 21 
(protection against deprivation of liberty) of the Indian Constitution, 
which are equivalent to articles 25, 15 and 9 of our Constitution, the 
Indian Supreme Court was able to hold that the bar-fetters could only be 
imposed in the rarest of situations and only where no other means of 
preventing the prisoners escape were available.
    
Nizam continued: In the circumstances we are clearly of the view that 
Sections 46(7) and 56 of the Prisons Act 1894 and Rules 643 to 655 of the 
Prison Rules framed under the said Sections are inconsistent and in 
violation of the fundamental rights enshrined in Article 14 of the 
Constitution as well as against the injunctions of Islam. As such, the same 
are declared as void and of no legal effect.
    
The entire judgement, on the question of fetters and many other sorry 
questions, was well written, well argued, and written with great feeling, 
the good (now murdered) judge having kept foremost in his mind the 
violation within our prisons of the dignity of man, of mans demeanment by 
man.
    
At the SAARC Law Conference in Delhi in 1994, this judgement was commented 
upon by Soli Sohrabji, eminent lawyer and former Attorney-General of India. 
We were highly complimented on its calibre.
    
Unfortunately, instead of allowing the judgement to help better the lot of 
our prisoners, in its infinite wisdom, the Sindh government led by chief 
Minister Abdullah Shah filed a petition in the Supreme Court asking that 
implementation of the judgement be stayed. The Supreme Court did not grant 
leave to appeal, but regrettably on March 31, 1994, much to the disgust of 
the people, it granted an interim stay.
    
In April 1996, the government appeal was fixed for hearing before a Supreme 
Court Bench comprising Justices Saleem Akhtar, Mukhtar Ahmed Junejo and 
Nasir Aslam Zahid. It was dismissed for non-prosecution as neither the 
appellant nor its counsel appeared in court. So, at the time Nizam was 
murdered, the stay had been vacated and his judgement was in force. No man 
is to be inhumanly fettered in our jails.
    
The Sindh government has now filed an application to restore its appeal. 
Should the Supreme Court be inclined to so do, it could insist on disposing 
of the main appeal along with the application. Seven years have elapsed 
since Chief Justice Ajmal Mian was appalled. Our imprisoned men must be 
told with certainty, without any further delay, if it is the wish of the 
judiciary of their fatherland, that they be shackled like animals.
    
Sindh still has the same Chief Minister, Syed Abdullah Shah. At the namaz-
e-janaza of Nizam and Nadeem, where true grief and genuine shock were 
manifested, the Chief Minister chose to grab a photo-opportunity and turned 
up preceded by a bevy of PTV cameramen. His procession of cars, sirens, and 
flashing lights was unseemly, disturbing, and quite out of place with the 
sadness and solemnity of the occasion. His bodyguards roughly pushed 
through the rows of mourners, shepherding Shah to the front row. The 
resentment on every face in the congregation was apparent. The TV men were 
not allowed to film the pious VVIP and they and their cameras were seen 
off. As for the Chief Minister, before the biers could be lifted and 
carried out of the mosque, he was hurriedly escorted back to his car (the 
engine and air- conditioning of which had been kept running) and noisily 
driven away.
    
Nadeem was Nizams only son. Left alone in their home now are Nizams wife 
(Nadeems mother), Nizams daughter (Nadeems sister), and Nadeems 
grandmother (Nizams mother-in-law and Justice Zahids mother). Their grief 
is intense which, apart from sharing with them, helpless as we are, we can 
do very little to alleviate.

<a name="mora">Morality check</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

IS the world a better place than it was a century ago? Has the human race 
evolved in this period? Are we more moral beings than our forefathers?
    
This morality check was triggered by a recent conversation with an old 
friend. Being a serious writer and deeply concerned about the spiritual 
development of his fellow-men, he devotes considerable thought to such 
questions. All in all, he thinks mankind has improved, and that this 
process is, broadly speaking, a continuous one. In short, humanity is 
moving towards a higher plane.
    
I disagreed. Such recent horrors as Bosnia, and the ongoing butchery in 
places like Rwanda do not, to my mind, give any cause for complacency. But 
I suppose its also a matter of perspective: sitting in England  where my 
friend lives  it may be possible to discern the contours of a just and 
humane society based on the rule of law and a respect for the individual. 
In much of the Third World, these values are conspicuous by their absence, 
and when stripped of the peeling veneer of assemblies and courts inherited 
from colonial powers, we are still governed by the law of the jungle.
    
Thus, two opposite trends seem to have emerged. While neither is the 
exclusive preserve of any one region, they can be broadly linked to levels 
of social and economic development. I know it is not politically correct to 
state it so baldly, but it seems nevertheless accurate (and honest) to 
conclude that much of the nastiness in the world is taking place in 
underdeveloped countries. One reason, of course, is that democratic 
institutions have not developed to the point where they can serve as 
effective checks on the powerful. Also, these societies have not evolved to 
the point where crises and quarrels between neighbours can be resolved 
amicably through give and take, so we have an endless series of localised 
but vicious wars. Or we have sullen and potentially explosive stand-offs 
like the Kashmir conflict.
    
Having made this sweeping generalisation, let me quickly dispel the notion 
that good and evil, right and wrong are the monopoly of any specific parts 
of the globe. The recent ethnic cleansing and near-genocide in Bosnia took 
place in a relatively developed region, and with the virtual connivance of 
most European countries. In fact, had it not been for the belated but 
robust American intervention, the Serbs would have been slaughtering 
Bosnian Muslims as you read this column. The immoral and indefensible 
embargo on arms to Bosnia is a reminder that even at the heart of 
civilisation, evil is alive and well.
    
Nearer home, the daily drip, drip, drip of the acid of corruption is an 
indication of our continuous slide into anarchy. Instead of leading us to a 
more ordered and regulated society, our elites are doing everything in 
their considerable power to rip the social fabric apart. Thus, we can see 
the struggle between good and evil all around us every day, and I am sorry 
to report that evil seems to be romping home to an easy victory. This is 
not to suggest that the ordinary citizen is any worse than his counterpart 
anywhere else. On the contrary, the average Pakistani is more forbearing 
and stoic in the face of adversity than most others. However, this cannot 
be said of the tiny fraction of the rich and the powerful who have obtained 
a stranglehold on this unfortunate countrys jugular. These people are 
determined to perpetuate the status quo to their narrow advantage at the 
expense of the rest of us.
    
Evil has degrees, as does good. Pressed to extremes, most of us are capable 
of taking human life. But the law makes a clear distinction between 
legitimate self-defence and cold-blooded murder for profit. Similarly, 
stealing food for ones starving children does not carry the same social 
sanction as does armed robbery for personal gain. So in this calculus of 
guilt, where do our tormentors and exploiters stand? Unfortunately, having 
no conscience or shame, they continue squeezing us without the slightest 
feeling of remorse or guilt. Most of these scoundrels take refuge behind 
religion, or rather, their self-serving interpretation of it.
    
For them, it is more than enough to observe the ritual and the rest will 
take care of itself. If they go on the occasional haj and umra, give a bit 
of zakat, fast during the month of Ramazan and pray frequently enough, they 
feel they have done enough to gain absolution for their sins. Indeed, the 
religious establishment encourages this optimistic view of salvation.
    
In truth, few of us develop a personal code of conduct based on 
introspection, reading and discussion. It is far more convenient to blindly 
and literally follow written rules than to take the spiritually draining 
and intellectually taxing task of working them out for ourselves. But once 
a kind of personal moral framework has been developed, gaining absolution 
becomes much harder. This is something the sleazeballs never attempt 
because apart from the spiritual struggle this entails, it also acts as a 
brake on their excesses. Better the moral certainties of a narrowly 
interpreted dogma than the slippery ambiguity of self- analysis and the 
loneliness of meditation.
    
Most leaders take a lofty and removed view of such questions  if they 
consider them at all. They do not feel themselves to be bound by what they 
consider to be middle-class morality. Indeed, they think themselves above 
rules of any kind. As they are working towards higher goals, the ends 
justify the means. Once this kind of thinking pervades the upper reaches of 
leadership, all kinds of evil are justified in the name of the greater 
good, and it is a short and slimy slide into the horrors of Belsen, Qana 
and Shatila.
    
But ultimately, we have to face the demons within. These wraith-like 
creatures feed on doubt and uncertainty, emotions unknown to the movers and 
shakers of the world. Protected by their impervious skins and blessed with 
calluses on their pinched and twisted souls, they are masters of all they 
survey. After all, havent they taken out insurance for the afterlife by 
following the required ritual?
    
There are times I wish it was as simple as this, specially in the uneasy 
hours of the early morning when the spirits tenancy of the body is at its 
most tenuous. This is also the time when statistically, the highest number 
of deaths occur. As I struggle to go back to sleep in the false dawn, I 
wish I could enjoy the moral certitude most people attain so easily.

ISLAMABAD: The Surrey mansion scandal is turning into a localised version 
of the hit soap series, Dynasty, dealing with the lives of the extremely 
wealthy and immensely powerful. A week back, no one even knew whether 
Sunday Express was a newspaper or some week-end train for tourists, but 
then Surrey mansion happened. Now it appears as if the British publication 
has inched ahead of even the most popular vernacular dailies. The papers 
stories are coveted and being quoted even before it hits the news-stands, 
thanks once again to the ongoing Surrey mansion saga.
    
And it was one such unpublished story which provided the leader of the 
opposition with a perfect kick-off to his opening speech on budget. The 
British journal in its latest issue, which should have hit the news-stands 
as Nawaz Sharif rose to speak, has reportedly published photographs of the 
manor with other details which the paper claims will substantiate its 
earlier story. The earlier story of course being the expose that Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto and her spouse had bought a 355-acre estate in 
Surrey with its own mansion, landing strip, indoor swimming pools etc.
    
The earlier issue of the Sunday Express had been made famous in Pakistan by 
a gloating opposition and all government denials notwithstanding, the 
charges seem to be gaining currency by the defensive posturing of the prime 
ministers house in the face of the ever increasing belligerency of the 
newspaper, and one coming out from a land with extremely punishing libel 
laws. Even the prime ministers staunchest sympathisers cannot comprehend 
why the paper is not being slapped with a libel suit, which by the 
prevalent convention would come to a minimum 25 million pounds sterling. As 
one opposition member quipped in the cafeteria: The prime minister says 
that it is below her dignity to respond to such charges but at the same 
time she holds a hour long press conference to do the same. She says why 
should the prime minister take notice of a rags charges whereas the rag 
keeps throwing fresh dirt at her, obviously one of them is lying.
    
This second story was simply too good for Nawaz Sharif to ignore, who 
realising the perfect sound bite it provided hammered the theme extensively 
before taking up his prepared budget speech. As expected, he pointed out 
the  painful contradictions, between the prime ministers purported 
feelings for the common man while indulging in such extravagance abroad. 
According to the leader of the opposition, the entire wretched nation was a 
milling mass of homeless millions but in his eagerness to blast the prime 
minister he, too, forgot a rather distasteful comment made by himself a few 
days back. While addressing a press briefing, the opposition leader in a 
moment of heightened passion had boasted that they talk about my Murree 
house. Well, Im building another one there and it will be complete soon. 
Whatever the reasons for saying so but in a nation where only one-third of 
the population owns a basic residential unit, even a leader of the 
opposition should not feel too proud to crow about his ability to own more 
houses than he can actually live in.
    
The new Sunday Express story has also charged that the prime ministers 
father-in-law, Hakim Ali Zardari, has purchased an apartment in Belgravia, 
the most expensive area of London. While in the same issue it has quoted 
the Pakistani press minister in London, Kamran Shafi, as admitting that 
many crates carrying antiques and vintage rifles etc were flown in from 
Pakistan. If the prime ministers version of not having bought any 
property in England, USA or France as she said in her press briefing, is 
to be believed then maybe the prime ministers house would at least clarify 
where all these crates were headed for and why they were flown in by PIA 
free of charge. Some of these questions were posed in the house while the 
others were grumbled angrily in the cafeteria but who knows, maybe it would 
be below the dignity of the government to explain even those acts that have 
been admitted to by its own London based functionaries.
    
Apart from his digression on the Surrey mansion issue, the leader of the 
opposition delivered an exhaustive and taxing assessment of the budget, an 
almost 70-minute speech to be exact, while a shorter one would have surely 
done as well.
    
It was arguably a good speech. It had enough of confusing financial 
statistics and nomenclatures (had to be Sartaj Azizs handiwork) to make it 
appear a serious professional dissection of the financial document and at 
the same time had enough rhetoric to qualify it as a public speech. As far 
as the authenticity of the figures quoted or the comparisons made by his 
own government were concerned, one would have to be naive or outright 
stupid to believe our economic wizards. When Sartaj Aziz was in the saddle 
he would rattle off misleading figures with the same convincing air of 
sincerity as our innocent Makhdoom Shahabuddin. There was a marked 
difference though, because at least Sartaj Aziz would do it deliberately 
while the Makhdoom Sahib does not even know what has been handed over to 
him to read by his unelected economic wizards.
    
Coming from a business background and having remained a strong proponent of 
incorporating the agricultural sector into the industrial classification, 
one would have expected a more honest approach on this matter from the 
former prime minister. But the impression one got was that with Punjab 
being his vote basket, he may have deliberately chosen to try appeasing the 
farming community in particular. There is nothing wrong with him speaking 
in favour of the farmers and agriculturists but at the same time he should 
have drawn a clear line between these and the feudals, something he forgot 
to do. Or could it be deliberate?
    
With Mian Sahib having had his say the opposition staged a protest boycott 
of the days sitting and it was a good thing it did because unlike the duty 
bound journalists it did not have to suffer the rude response of the doctor 
from Mianwali.
    
The minister for special education, Dr Sher Afgan showed that he himself 
needed a crash course in simple manners and on how a fully grown individual 
would be expected to behave. A choice of bad words, coupled with an equally 
repulsive manner of speech and one lacking in real substance was how his 
speech could be summed up. If only one had the authority to end it as 
quickly as well.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

THE mad cow disease is not confined to British beef. The tabloids have 
their own version of it and while British beef can be banned, the tabloids 
cannot.
    
The Sunday Express doesnt quite fall in the category of a tabloid in the 
sense it is not as rabid as some of the others, nevertheless it has been 
known to shoot from the hip. But I am still surprised that it chose to run 
a story that is patently concocted and could well have been inspired. I 
am still not convinced whether it was meant to be a spoof since the story 
has all the hallmarks of a prank. In some countries, notably Sri Lanka, the 
newspapers play all manner of jokes on their readers on April Fools Day. 
The Sunday Express story has appeared in June. Could it have been touched 
by summer madness?
    
But the implacable foes of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari 
appear to have swallowed it hook, line and sinker and got on their white 
charger, lance in hand and in the memorable words of Stephen Leacock rode 
madly off in all directions. Consider simply the absurdity of The Sunday 
Express story. The Prime Minister and her spouse have bought a 355 acre 
mansion in Surrey for 2.5 million pounds. This itself suggests that the 
mansion was acquired at a throw-away price for it is no ordinary mansion. 
It has a private landing strip, an indoor swimming pool and has been turned 
into a Surrey version of Fort Knox. There are laser beam alarms and 
security men on the ground. Police sources said that if a security alarm 
is sounded Scotland Yard will be informed and armed response vehicles 
despatched immediately, the story informs its readers.
    
This is the stuff of a James Bond movie. The only thing missing is a 
piranha infested pond where unwelcome intruders can be dumped though the 
mansion would appear to have an air defence system for The Sunday Express 
story quotes a contractor as saying that when a plane flew over the 
property twice, guards reached for their guns. This is supposed to be 
Surrey, England. It would have sounded probable had it been the stronghold 
of a drug baron in Colombia or the hideout of Zapasta guerillas in Mexico. 
How in Gods name can anyone believe this kind of poppycock? And how could 
The Sunday Express editors have cleared this rubbish?
    
Last year, The Sunday Times did an investigative report on Malaysia in 
which it was insinuated that the Prime Minister Mr Mahatir Mohammad was on 
the take. The Malaysian reaction was swift. All British contracts were 
cancelled and a well-administered kick landed on the backside of the 
newspaper. Full page advertisements were taken out by the British companies 
who were affected and apologies were offered for the story which was also 
disowned. And though Andrew Neil the editor of the newspaper stuck to his 
guns, it was not long after that he left the newspaper for what was claimed 
to be greener pastures. But the newspaper ended with egg on its face.
    
I think the Pakistan High Commission in London should not only demand an 
explanation from The Sunday Express but an apology as well. It is a 
potentially damaging story and involves no less a person than a head of 
government of a Commonwealth country. The newspaper, on its own, could 
carry out a thorough probe on how such a cock and bull story landed on its 
pages. If there is an ounce of integrity in the newspaper, they will want 
to know whether their reporter was a simpleton or too clever for words. 
Even the British tabloids like to believe that they have a reputation to 
maintain.
    
Let me make it clear that I would be just as angry if a story like this one 
had appeared about Nawaz Sharif or any of our political leaders. I think it 
is a shame that we should be seen to be washing our dirty linen in public 
on the basis of a report in a foreign rag. Pakistans image is already 
tarnished. Ask anyone who arrives at an international airport with a green 
passport in his hand. They are instantly suspect and they are considered to 
be guilty of unspecified crimes and the onus of proving their bonafides is 
with them.
    
An unknown Berlin-based organisation concludes on the basis of the 
flimsiest research that Pakistan is the second most corrupt country in the 
world. When I was in PIA, I had to deal with a Hong Kong based market 
research company with high sounding credentials. The proposal they offered 
was simple: for a fee (which was considerable) they would proclaim PIA as 
the best airline in the region and give PIA high marks for its punctuality, 
its cabin service and its food. They made it sound tempting. But what if we 
didnt buy? Then we could take our chances and could find that their 
research showed PIA to be among the worst airlines in the region.
    
When I suggested to them that the deal smacked of blackmail, I was told 
that it was just business, admittedly of a cut-throat kind. Ever since I 
have been deeply suspicious of organisations that do surveys on Third World 
countries. But it takes two to be corrupt. If Pakistan is the one party, 
who is the other? which businessmen of which country are paying kick-backs? 
Surely they are equally guilty of corruption. We should not believe the 
worst of ourselves even if it is a foreign organisation or newspaper making 
the accusation. We should care a little about our own self-respect and not 
seem to enjoy being called corrupt, as some are doing. We have enough 
enemies. Why should we add to them by being our own worst enemies?

Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD: In terms of quality speeches, Wednesday proved one big yawn. 
Barring a brief and incisive discourse by the oppositions Ejaz Shafi, the 
house played host to listless treasury members presenting superficial 
assessments of the budget document and indulging in self- congratulating 
tirades. 
   
Of course there were few exciting moments like when personal grudge took 
the better of the treasurys Tariq C.Qaiser who turned upon his own 
fraternity member, federal minister J.Salik. 
   
Ostensibly, Qaisers national pride had been wounded, as he put it, by the 
disgraceful manner in which Salik had behaved during a recent foreign 
visit but everybody knew better. With basically only one ministry going to 
the minority members club, Qaisers grudge against Salik is an open secret. 
Even George Clement has a job of a parliamentary secretary while Qaiser, 
with his spiky moustache and proud strut, has been left out in the cold. 
So, while the intensity of his speech may have proved a bit surprising, 
that it happened did not. 
   
He charged that the Khaddar clad minister who never tired of harping 
about the poor mans plight made a big scene when he did not receive a 
royal protocol. According to Qaiser, an infuriated Salik had then called a 
press conference to lament against the behaviour of the embassy staff and 
had suggested that he had been meted such rough treatment because of his 
being a minority member. 
   
Being a treasury Christian, Qaiser would have none of it and said that it 
was one thing for us to complain about certain things while inside the 
country but when a minister goes abroad and does such a thing he humiliates 
the country. Having got it all off his chest, he then went on to praise 
the budget which, judging from his speech, was obviously something he had 
not understood. Mercifully, J.Salik was not present in the house at the 
time. But theres always another day and knowing Salik he is not going to 
let the slur go by unanswered. 
   
While the house laboured from one dismal oratory performance to another, 
the activity outside was hectic, starting from Asif Zardaris dashing to 
Fazlur Rehmans side to Nawaz Sharifs planned bashing of the government on 
June 23rd. 
   
First Maulana Fazlur Rehman episode. Both Nawabzada Nasrullah and the 
Maulana had been invited to lunch by the prime minister but only Nawabzada 
Nasrullah turned up. It could have been because of the recent muted 
rumblings of the majority of her political allies or some other 
consideration but the prime minister dispatched Zardari to meet the Maulana 
in his assembly offices. As fate would have it, while the two sat talking a 
messenger came in with a message that the oppositions Chaudhry Nisar had 
come to see him. 
   
Upon hearing this the Maulana, according to a reliable witness, reportedly 
turned towards a smiling Asif and said: See, how the opposition is 
contacting me. Nisars coming over was an interesting story by itself. 
	
   
It so happened that upon learning about the Maulanas missed luncheon 
appointment, Nawaz Sharif had immediately sent Nisar over to his chambers, 
perhaps to gauge his mood and reasons for not going there because knowing 
Maulana Sahib, he is hardly one to miss an appointment with anyone in 
power. 
   
When a rather amused Nisar Ali went back and reported the ongoing meeting 
between the two gentlemen, another opposition MNA quipped: We have just 
raised the bargaining price of our so-called disgruntled friends. 
   
The emergence of the disgruntled block within the ruling alliance does have 
its share of strange contradictions. On the one hand Maulana Fazlur 
Rehmans party is ruling hand in glove with the PPP and on the other it has 
announced a three-part protest campaign against various government 
decisions like budget, abolition of death penalty for women and even such 
ambiguous concerns as perceived obscenity, an otherwise easily avoidable 
issue. 
   
The recent behaviour of the more prominent erstwhile allies like Ghulam 
Mustafa Jatoi, Mir Balakh Sher Mazari and Nawabzada Nasrullah is proving 
equally difficult to fathom. Complaining about various national ailments 
and now openly voicing their disenchantment with almost every major 
government decision, they have gone as far as affixing their signatures to 
the creation of an independent reformist group within parliament. 
   
But having said all that and going on with their persistent criticism of 
government policies, they have yet to match their words with deeds. While 
Mr Jatois nephew remains a provincial minister, the sons of both Nawabzada 
Nasrullah and Balakh Sher Mazari continue to head choice ministries in 
Punjab. Either something is amiss here or we the ordinary people are too 
dumb to comprehend the logic of our political elite. 	
   
As for the perpetual skeptics in the opposition camp, the latest rumblings 
from the veterans group are being dismissed as nothing more than a fresh 
move to get their pay packages revised. 	
   
Talk has it that intense jockeying is taking place in the federal capital 
for a prized post all the way in Karachi. A senior bureaucrat, while 
sipping his hot cafeteria tea, revealed that two top bureaucrats were 
fighting it out over the post of the chairman of Pakistan Steel, at present 
held as an acting charge by the younger brother of federal secretary Salman 
Farouqi. Since his taking over, the mills has shown a considerable turn 
around and sensing the possibility of his brothers being made permanent 
the anti-Salman lobby has swung into full action.
   
The old rivalry between the acting chairmans elder brother and another 
equally powerful super bureaucrat is well known in Islamabad and 
bureaucratic circles await the final outcome with bated breaths.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="seri">Series in England will be tilted to Pakistan: Majid</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, June 19: Former Test captain and PCB Chief Executive Majid Khan has 
said that England was now a rejuvenated side due to recent victories over 
India, but knowledge of English conditions on the part of about a dozen of 
the Pakistani team members and their experience of playing against most of 
the English players should tilt the scale in Pakistans favour.
 
During an exclusive interview Majid Khan said although the Pakistan team 
was not too balanced, it would not prove a push-over like the Indian side 
in the forthcoming series. Both the Tests and one-day internationals 
between England and Pakistan would be tough, well-fought and exciting.
 
Majid said the England team had always been formidable on home grounds but 
its recent resurrection after the dismal performance in the World Cup had 
been due to the induction of new players. Its morale was very high due to 
convincing wins over the Indian team, which put up a very poor show.
 
He said that no change had been made in the 17-member Pakistan team because 
the chief selector and captain regarded it as the best lot picked out of 
the available talent in the country. Now it was up to the Pakistani 
players to exploit their vast experience to the full to return a good 
performance during the series.

<a name="keyf">Key factors for success of England-bound team</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

Three Fs fitness, form and fielding will be the factors determining the 
extent of success of the Pakistan cricket team during its 72-day tour of 
England.
    
The 20-member side leaves Lahore for England via Holland to play three 
Tests and an equal number of limited-overs internationals. This is 
Pakistans third tour of England in nine years.
    
In 1987, Pakistan, under Imran Khan, played a weather-marred six-Test 
series and by virtue of an innings and 18 runs triumph at Headingley 
(Leeds) registered their first-ever series victory over England.
    
Five years later, Javed Miandads men performed even better: two Tests wins 
for the first time at Lords by two wickets, and at The Oval by 10 wickets 
on way to a 2-1 victory. The only defeat in the series (by six wickets) was 
at Headingley (Leeds) in which the umpires (Ken Palmer and Mervin Kitchen) 
played a more dominant role than the England players.
    
In this background, Pakistan may be favourites for the series subject to 
form, fitness and fielding which have been uncertain factors in recent 
years.
    
True, it is the sole responsibility of a professional sportsman to ensure 
top fitness but there is no denying the fact that there has been an 
alarming deterioration particularly in respect of fitness and fielding. 
These two factors cost Pakistan four Tests (out of seven) and 12 one-day 
internationals (out of 23) in the 1995-96 international circuit.
    
Pakistan lost the home series against Sri Lanka because of Wasim Akram 
frozen shoulder during the second Test at Faisalabad after steering 
Pakistan to an innings victory with a 10-wicket haul at Peshawar. Waqar 
Younis, who was already suffering from stress fracture in the back, opted 
out after the Peshawar game also.
    
Two months later, Pakistan showed greasy palms and floored eight catches in 
the first innings and lost the opening Test against Australia and 
consequently the series 2-1. In the World Cup quarter-final against India, 
Wasim Akram was again out of commission following injury during the game 
against New Zealand.
    
Fitness, is a suspect factor again because the players have trained in 43 
degree centigrade at Lahore against Englands average temperature of 15 to 
20 degree centigrade, increasing risk percentage for problems like pull 
muscle.
    
One feels that the original plan for a training camp at Lilleshall, in the 
outskirts of London, may have been productive for acclimatisation.
    
As for the form, Pakistan has always been a highly unpredictable team. But 
on the last tours of England, they surprised even their best supporters by 
consistent good form.

<a name="akra">Akram wants to lead from the front and set an example</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, June 15: Wasim Akram is determined to lead the Pakistan cricket 
team on the England tour from the front and set an example to the other 
players.
    
If I have to get the best out of my players, I have to set an example for 
which I am training and working religiously, the skipper said from his 
Lahore residence.
    
Wasim Akram, the brilliant allrounder, stated that he realises that in the 
last season his performance was not up to the mark. I have to get wickets 
and contribute some runs as well.
    
Although it is a three-Test series, I would love to steer Pakistan to 
victory single-handedly at least in one Test. And that can be achieved if I 
get 10 wickets and score 100 odd runs with the bat in a match.
    
There has been some concern in cricket quarters that the captaincy is 
taking a toll on me. I want to prove that wrong and the only way is to 
perform in the field, Akram, who sounded confident, stated.
    
Akram said that during the Lahore training camp, he did not only bowl long 
spells, he also concentrated on his batting. I know I can bat which will 
be of immense value for the team. He recalled his only Test century some 
seven years back.
    
Akram stressed that Imran Khan and Javed Miandad extracted the best out of 
their men only because they believed in the performance on the field which 
they often did. And it is precisely why they are considered among the best 
of the Pakistan skippers. I also want to achieve that reputation.

<a name="indi">Indian batsmen get tips from Miandad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed
    
LONDON, June 18: Lords buzzed with excitement when three of the great 
names in sports entered through the Nursery End to watch India practise for 
the coming Thursdays second Test against England. The cameramen, autograph 
hunters and those cricket buffs who tour England and visit the home of 
cricket on a conducted tour reacted with as much enthusiasm as did the 
Indian in the nets.
    
There was, of course, Javed Miandad, the former Pakistan captain and one of 
the most prolific and distractive batsmen of modern day cricket and with 
him none else than a name as illustrious as the great Vivian Richards and 
one of the masters of all time in the game of squash, Jahangir Khan.
    
For Indian and its players, it was a sort of a god-sent opportunity. They 
wasted no time to get hold of Miandad and seek guidance. Sanjay Manjrekar, 
Ajay Jadeja, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Azharuddin and the rest had 
their turn to talk to him and Miandad unruffled as he always was when in 
crisis or in blessedness obliged. Counselling with them about the technique 
and tactics which they need to tackle the vagaries of English conditions.
    
The former Chairman of the Indian selectors, Raj Singh of Dungurpur, and 
the former captain of India, Ajit Wadekar, watched in awe as the Indians 
listened to the master batsman, Miandad. India may not win the Test but its 
players surely must have had a useful amount of cricket pumped into them by 
the former Pakistan captain.
    
The other two, Viv Richards and Jahangir Khan, stood away from them at a 
distance watching and listening to Miandad as he put his foot forward and 
waved his hands moved his wrists to show to the Indian batsmen the virtues 
of being a successful batsman and a bowler.
    
I do not mind helping people if they seek advice. Whatever I have learnt 
has also been given to me by others so why shouldnt I help others, said 
Miandad to the waiting Indian Press.

Richards and Jahangir, looking fit as a fiddle, obliged autograph hunters 
and posed for pictures as Miandad continued his long coaching session with 
the Indians.

<a name="germ">Germany blast Pakistan 5-1</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sydney Friskin

MILTON KEYNES, June 16: Pakistan were brought down to earth with a 
devastating 5-1 defeat by Germany on the final day of the pre-Atlanta 
hockey tournament on Sunday before a crowd of about 3,000 spectators here.
    
Expectations of a stirring battle between the Olympic champions and the 
World Cup holders were unrealised in a match which by half-time had become 
embarrassingly one-sided with the Germans leading 4-0.
    
By that time Pakistan's defence was in disarray, the Germans having 
capitalised on their mistakes which was evidenced by the lack of covering 
and marking. The tendency to commit stick obstruction proved costly in the 
form of penalty corners, four of which were conceded in the first half.
    
The fact that one of the fullbacks, Danish Kaleem, was still unwell did not 
help Pakistan's cause.
    
Giving his reactions after the match Samiullah Khan, the Pakistan manager, 
said: "I do not know what happened to our defence in the first half but 
after a talk during the interval we played more steadily in the second 
half," he said.

Teams
    
Pakistan: Mansoor Ahmed, Naveed Alam, Rana Mujahid, Mohammed Usman, 
Mohammed Khalid, Malik Shafqat, Mohammed Sarwar, Tahir Zaman, Mohammed 
Anis, Mohammed Shahbaz, Aleem Raza.

Germany on goal difference Pakistan were third and Great Britain fourth.

AMSTELVEEN, June 19: Pakistan suffered another crushing defeat at the hands 
of Germany going down 6-1 in the first match of the four-nation hockey 
tournament for the NCM Trophy.
    
If it is any consolation Pakistan played better than they did at Milton 
Keynes. They pushed forward with resolution and defended more confidently 
but the goals just did not come.
    
The fact had to be faced, however, that while Pakistan were still feeling 
their way around the Germans settled down to play hockey with awesome 
efficiency and smut on this showing be fancied to repeat their Milton 
Keynes triumph. Their side was reinforced by the return of Sven Meinhardt 
and Oliver Dowkhe but both appeared only as substitutes. Andreas Becker 
scored four goals.
    
Danish Kalim recovered from his recent illness to play at right back for 
Pakistan alongside Naveed Ala. The attack was led by Aleem Raza with 
Mohammad Sarwar at outside right. The inside forward Tahir Zaman and 
Mohammad Shahbaz had their moments but neither was able to seize the half 
chance.

Germany: C. Reitz, C. Fisher, C. Blunck, V. Fried, G. Mayerhofer, K.

<a name="paki">Pakistan to take part in five events in Olympics</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, June 16: Pakistan will take part in only five events of the games 
at Atlanta from July 19 to Aug 4 after its rower Mohammad Akrams defeat in 
the Asian Olympic qualifying regatta at Toda. Pakistan will compete in 
hockey, boxing, athletics, swimming and wrestling.
 
A reliable source said that Mohammad Akram was reportedly beaten in the 
single sculls event of the regatta to second place by a Japanese rower. He 
was the only qualifier of the event.
 
Hectic behind-the-scene manoeuvrings were on to get the approval of the 
Atlanta Olympic Games Organising Committee and the International Olympic 
Committee (IOC) for some new players in place of those already named in the 
list of tentative 25 players out of whom 16 were to form the Pakistan team. 
Strangely enough, every National Olympic Committee had been asked by the 
organisers to furnish names of their teams and sportsmen by June 16.
  
Unfortunately, due to a turmoil in Pakistan hockey, even the names of 25 
players have not been finalised as yet what to speak of naming the 16-
member Pakistan hockey team. Due to special efforts, the Organising 
Committee may agree to the last-minute change in the name of manager and 
coach of the Pakistan team.

Four Pakistanis Abdul Rasheed Qambrani, Usmanullah, Abdul Rasheed Baloch 
and Sifarish Khan, now training in Cuba, will compete in the boxing event 
of the Atlanta Olympics. Former Asian Games silver-medalist and a renowned 
technical official of AIBA Syed Mohammad Ghaznavi will be the manager and 
Rafael Ramirez (Cuba) will be the coach of the team. The famous 
international boxer Col. Abdus Samad Mir will be the technical official.
 
In athletics, Aqarab Abbas and Shabana Akhtar will compete while Col. Zafar 
Ahmad will accompany the team as manager.
 
The only Pakistani swimmer taking part in  the Olympics  will be Kamal 
Salman Masud, who will fly  from Pennsylvania while Mian Abdul Wajid be his 
manager.
 
A wild-card entry from Pakistan in wrestling event of the Olympic Games is 
Mohammad Bashir Bhola Bhala. Pakistan Amateur Wrestling Federation 
Secretary Chaudhry Mohammad Arif is accompanying the Pakistani contingent 
as the secretary so no need of a manger or coach to be sent with him has 
been felt.
 
Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) President Air  Vice- Marshal Farooq Umar 
is the Chef-de-Mission of the Pakistani contingent. While the Pakistan 
hockey team will go to Atlanta from Canada, where it will play some 
practice matches, the rest of the Pakistani contingent is expected to fly 
to Atlanta in the middle of July.

<a name="kama">Kamal Masud only swimmer to compete at Atlanta</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent
  
LAHORE, June 16: Olympic Solidarity, an IOC organisation, has showed 
special interest in the top Pakistani swimmer Kamal Salman Masud who is 
studying on its scholarship in the United States.
 
On June 13, Olympic Solidarity Executive Assistant Beatrix Hurst sent a 
special fax-message to Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) inquiring whether 
Kamal was going to participate in the swimming events of the 26th Olympic 
Games at Atlanta or not.
 
In a return-message sent on Monday evening, the POA Secretary General 
Mohammad Latif Butt, who is also the Secretary of the Pakistan swimming 
Federation (PASF) has replied that Kamal was the only swimmer who would be 
representing Pakistan in the Atlanta Olympics. His manager would be the 
PASF Treasurer Mian Abdul Wajid. The message also informs that Kamal would 
come from his Merceberg Academy in Pennsylvania (where he is studying on 
the Olympic Solidarity Scholarship) to join the Pakistani contingent in 
Atlanta in mid July. The swimming events of Olympic Games will be organised 
at the Georgia Technical Aquatic Centre from July 20 to 26.
 
Kamal Salman Masood was awarded three-year Olympic Scholarship for Young, 
Promising Athletes as being the most outstanding swimmer of Pakistan. He 
was paid ten thousand dollars besides other academic expenses for the year 
1995-96. His scholarship is expected to be increased for the next two years 
(1996-97 and 1997-98).
 
Kamal was a member of the quartet of Mercebergh Academy which won a bronze 
medal in the 4x200 metres freestyle relay event of the American Zone 
Swimming Championship.</pre>
