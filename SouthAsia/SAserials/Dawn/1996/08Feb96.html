<a name="cour">Court cannot pre-empt FGCM judgement: SC</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 7: The Supreme Court observed that it did not want to 
pre-empt the judgement of Field General Court Martial in the attempted 
coup case and also observed that the court cannot do anything if the 
coup plotters were tortured as claimed by the petitioners.
    
Justice Saeeduzzaman Siddiqui, who is heading the three-member bench 
hearing the case, made these observations when the petitioners 
counsel S.K.A. Samdani argued that his client Maj. Gen Zaheerul Islam 
Abbassi was being tortured.
    
The judge said the other side had already denied the charges of 
torture on the accused officers and Supreme Court was not a trial 
court to resolve the issue.

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 1: The World Bank has slapped a 2,500mw limit until 
1998 on the issuance of letters of support (LoS) to private sector 
sponsors intending to set up thermal power plants in Pakistan.

The World Bank is said to have imposed the 2,500mw limit for the next 
three years essentially to keep the resulting financial burden on 
Pakistan well within its paying capacity. Under the agreements signed 
with each sponsor, the government is obliged to buy through WAPDA the 
entire capacity of each station and its output at a highly inflated 
rate.

KARACHI, Feb. 1: The Sindh Assembly approved a bill to further amend 
the Sindh Ministers (Salaries, Allowances and Privileges) Act 1975, 
allowing the chief minister to import or buy a Mercedes Benz 280 SEL 
or equivalent for his personal use, with full exemption from Custom 
duties and sales tax.
    
The bill was tabled in the House by provincial Minister for Law and 
Parliamentary Affairs Pir Mazhar-ul-Haq and was adopted unanimously in 
no time as none of the members opposed it.
    
The federal government had earlier allowed the chief ministers of 
other three provinces to import or buy a Mercedes Benz 280 SEL, exempt 
from Custom duties and sales tax, or equivalent for their personal use 
out of bond.
    
The governors of all the provinces also enjoy this privilege.

Bureau Report    

ISLAMABAD, Jan 1: The police have arrested a terrorist who confessed 
at a news conference that he was involved in the killing of a U.S. 
Consulate employee in Karachi and also in a rocket attack on a police 
station.
    
The alleged accused told the news conference that after passing his 
intermediate examination he applied for admission in the Karachi 
University in 1989 where he was assured by the leaders of All Pakistan 
Mohajir Students Organisation (APMSO), that they would arrange his 
admission. However, when he could not get admission, he was told that 
his seat was given to a Punjabi student.
    
The APMSO leaders told me that they were struggling to end this 
injustice and asked me to join their struggle which I agreed, he 
added.
    
He said in August 1995, he was contacted by Saulat who told him that 
Altaf Hussain has ordered to kill some official of the U.S. Embassy so 
that they should close their Consulate office in Karachi.
    
Ziaullah said Shahnawaz Taimuri, an employee of the U.S. Consulate 
General was targeted and his movements were monitored to chalk out the 
strategy.

<a name="priv">Privatisation: much sold, little retained</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed

WHILE President Farooq Leghari, who was earlier rather critical of the 
kind of privatisation process under way in Pakistan, has now approved 
it subject to some common stipulations, the public has many questions 
to ask as it is in the dark about key parts of the crucial process.

The President has underscored the need for transparency and clean 
dealings in this area, and stepped up efforts to sell the "family 
silver" at the highest possible prices to the best possible buyers, 
but the public has not been told all the facts it wants to know.

The public wants to know not only how the major enterprises, like the 
top banks of the country, DFIs big power and gas companies, 26 percent 
shares of the Pakistan Tele communications Corporation and many 
manufacturing units in the public sector are sold but also what is 
done with the vast sale proceeds. They do not like the spectre of the 
family silver or the major assets of the nation begin liquidated fast 
while its debt or liabilities keep on mounting.

The first question relates to the total sales proceeds of the 
privatisation under way for the last five years. Chairman Naveed Qamar 
of the Privatisation commission says total sales proceeds of the 100 
industrial units two banks - MCB and Allied Bank - and 12 percent 
shares of the PTC, sold here and abroad, are Rs. 42 billion.

Sales of 12 percent shares of the PTC alone fetched Rs.30 billion from 
sale of 1 million vouchers to Pakistanis and Rs. 27 billion from the 
sale of 15 million vouchers abroad. After that Rs. one billion was 
given out as commission to foreign brokers the net sale proceeds of 
the privatisation should be Rs. 29 billion. If that amount is deducted 
from the total sale proceeds of Rs. 42 billion the net gain from the 
sale of 100 industrial units, two banks is just Rs. 13 billion which 
give the impression the PC has been selling not the family silver but 
the family junk. If that is so the government ought to explain in 
clear terms and tell us how much was given out as golden handshake and 
to meet the expenses of the Privatisation Commission and on the other 
accounts.

The second major question relates to the use of the sales proceeds. 
National consensus is that the money should be used to reduce the vast 
national debt which is over Rs. 800 billion as domestic debt and about 
$35 billion inclusive of long medium and short term external debt and 
over $7 billion received from the foreign exchange deposits of 
resident and non-resident Pakistanis and the money brought into 
foreign banks functioning in Pakistan. The nation's major economists, 
ranging from Dr. Mahbubul Haq to Mr Moeen Qureshi and Dr. Hafeez Pasha 
too agree on the need for use on the privatisation firms to reduce the 
overwhelming debt of the country which now exceeds a year's GDP. And 
in fact Mr. Quershi as caretaker Prime Minister had set up a debt 
reduction Fund to which the sales proceeds of privatisation were to be 
credited. But no government has put any money into it.

Mr. Qamar now says that $200 million out of the sales proceeds were 
paid for debt reduction and another $200 million may be paid before 
the end of June. That means that out of the net total Rs. 42 billion 
received so far only Rs. 6.13 billion was used for debt reduction. The 
fact is that if all that money had been kept in a bank as fixed 
deposit the interest earnings from that alone would have been very 
large.

Last year's federal budget provided for the use of Rs. 11 billion for 
the Social Action Programme but according to the Minister of State for 
Finance, Makhdoom Shahbuddin, only Rs. 5 billion was used for SAP and 
the rest elsewhere, and there is a budget sanction of Rs. 12 billion 
for SAP this year.

Dubious:

The fundamental question which arises following the statement of Mr. 
Naveed Qamar is: why should all the sales proceeds of privatisation be 
used for debt reduction only after June 30 and not before? A number of 
major enterprises like the United Bank, Bankers Equity, not Adu Power 
plant and 26 percent of the shares of the PTC are to be privatised 
before June. So why can't the sales proceeds which are with the 
government, plus the large amounts as they come in be credited to the 
Debt Reduction Fund, and the overall national debt, beginning with the 
higher cost domestic debt, be reduced from now on instead of waiting 
for five more months for this were essential process to begin? We 
ought to be told the reasons.

What is surprising is the President's silence on the issue of 
utilisation of the sales proceeds. He ought to have spoken clearly and 
emphatically on this vital aspect of privatisation instead of leaving 
it to the government to decide. In fact the issue is of paramount 
importance as during the next 11 months major power plants and 
distribution companies like KESC and Faisalabad power company, Sui 
Southern and Northern companies, Habib Bank etc. are to be privatised. 
And the IMF and World Bank are goading the government to move much 
faster in that direction, though in the prevailing political and 
economic conditions and state of the stock markets shares of such 
projects are not likely to get the best prices, which they would have 
if the situation in the country was far better or far less 
confrontational.

Mr. Naveed Qamar on the one side says his PC has no authority to speak 
on utilisation of the sales proceeds and on the other side says all 
the funds from the sales will be used for debt reduction after June. 
In such a situation the country needs a categorical commitment from 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto who is also the Finance Minister, in 
this regard along with a white paper on the extent of privatisation 
done since the MCB was privatised in June, 1991, how much money was 
received and how much has been spent and under what heads, and the 
balance in the kitty unless that too has been used to meet the soaring 
current expenditure of the government.

Funfair 

The PC or the government has been unfair to the ICP NIT and State Life 
whose shares the privatised enterprises too were sold by it but it did 
not give them their share of the sales proceeds. It was only after the 
Prime Minister intervened to save the sinking stock exchanges and 
directed the PC to hand over the shares of the three DFIs did the PC 
agree to give the funds to them although they were not large and 
should have been given earlier.

A new scandal arose when the PC accepted recently the highest bid of 
Rs. 367 million for 267 Kanals land of the Pakistan Engineering 
Company (the once flourishing BECO at Lahore and then changed the 
terms of sale and allowed the buyer to use the land for commercial 
purposes as well. If that change had been effected before the side the 
land might have fetched Rs. 1,000 million. But now following the 
threat of the losers and others to move the courts to stop the deal 
Mr. Naveed Qamar says the cabinet has not approved the deal and the 
land may be sold under fresh terms in private.

All these aspects of privatisation demand that there should be real 
transparency and absolute clarity in the process as the President 
wants, but a greater purposefulness and red focus on reducing the 
staggering national debt, which is the source of many fiscal and 
monetary ills in the country, and the will to get the best out of 
privatisation for the country and make these units flourish, expand 
and add to the national wealth and economic well-being.

<a name="imfc">IMF condition accepted</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 7: The government has accepted one of the major 
conditions of the IMF that entire privatisation proceeds will be used 
for debt retirement only after June this year.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the International Monetary Fund had 
threatened to cancel even the newly signed standby loan of 600 million 
dollars if the government did not extend written assurances that 
privatisation proceeds would not be used for deficit reduction 
purposes after June this year. We had no option but to accept this 
harsh condition, he added.
    
Sources said the Fund even opposed the use of the privatisation funds 
for high priority development projects. They called for re-examining 
these special development projects which needed funds from the 
privatisation proceeds.
    
Sources said the Fund members were of the view that Pakistan must get 
rid of its huge Rs 800 billion domestic debt by retiring it through 
sale proceeds of the privatisation.
    
They have also told the government that it should also do away with 
various exemptions and subsidies to reduce the growing budget deficit 
now said to have reached to Rs 120 billion.
    
However, sources said the Fund members assured Pakistan to recommend 
to their headquarters to release the second tranche of 145 million 
dollars to Pakistan out of 600 million dollars standby loan negotiated 
on 5.5 percent mark up rate compared to 0.5 percent of extended 
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Extended Fund facility 
(EFF).

<a name="paki">Pakistan Times sold to UNN</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 6: The  Pakistan Times , once a leading newspaper, 
which was founded by Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah in 1946, was 
sold for Rs46.1 million.
    
The final bidding for the machinery and declaration of the paper, 
published from Lahore and Islamabad, won by Mian Saifur Rehman of the 
Universal News Network (UNN), turned out to be an anticlimax as only 
two bidders, out of nine, turned up.
    
All the known newspaper groups which had been earlier short-listed for 
the final bidding stayed away, only leaving Saifur Rehman and the 
journalists group backed by ex-MNA Akbar Ali Bhatti.
    
Although we have got a good price, it was disappointing that only two 
bidders came for the final bidding, Syed Naveed Qamar, chairman of the 
Privatisation Commission, told  Dawn.  His disappointment was 
understandable as it was the second time that the bidding had taken 
place.
    
Earlier, ex-senator Yousaf Shaheens bid of Rs110 million had been 
accepted, but he had to arrange the amount. The Commission then 
decided to sell the machinery and declaration in the first phase and 
the real estate in the next.
    
Established by Mian Iftikhar-ud-Din, the Progressive Papers Limited 
(PPL) owned and published The Pakistan Times, as well as Imroze, an 
Urdu-language daily, and weekly Lail-o-Nahar, Sportimes.
    
The cabinet committee on privatisation would now ratify the deal, and 
then a letter of support would be issued to the winning party, asking 
them to submit 40 percent of the total amount within a period of three 
months.
    
The auction of the real estate will be held later, but the dates have 
not yet been finalised. The UNN also purchased Mashriq of Lahore for  
Rs6 million.

<a name="wont">Pakistan wont bow to Indian pressure: Assef</a>

LAHORE, Feb. 4: An atomic test by India would end the nuclear 
ambiguity which had enabled Pakistan and India to maintain peace 
during the last 25 years, and lead to grave consequences for the 
entire region, Foreign Minister Assef Ahmad Ali said.
    
He said by testing the Prithvi missile, India had also forced Pakistan 
to make missiles, and set in motion a new arms race. He pointed out 
that India in the 70s had exploded its nuclear device, then in the 80s 
it had initiated an arms race in the subcontinent and now it had begun 
a missile race. Pakistan would respond remaining within the parameters 
of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), but it would make 
every effort to offset the edge India appeared to be enjoying at 
present, and would not accept pressure from any country, including the 
United States, as it had the right to take steps to safeguard its 
national security.
    
He said Pakistan had already started making missiles and some of them 
had been tested when Gen. Aslam Beg was army chief.

Addressing a Press conference, three leaders of the party, MNA Mian 
Abdul Wahid, MPA Mian Abdus Sattar and Begum Mehnaz Rafi, said it was 
Mr Nawaz Sharif who had worked for holding the World Cup in Pakistan, 
and there was no question of his partymen thinking of sabotaging it.

They said by accusing their party of indulging in acts of terrorism, 
the government was violating all political, constitutional and human 
rights norms.
    
They condemned Punjab Chief Minister Arif Nakais statements against 
their party in which he had accused it of backing terrorist 
activities. They said he had unjustifiably set the police to harass 
and arrest party workers.

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 6: Mian Mohammad Sharif, father of the leader of 
opposition, was flown to London for emergency medical treatment. Mian 
Sharif has a history of coronary complications.
    
Mr Sharifs departure was, however, marred by a confrontation between 
his family members and the Federal Investigation Agency officials who 
initially refused to allow him to board the London-bound aircraft. 
They insisted that Mr Sharif could not be allowed to leave the country 
as his name was included in the exit control list (ECL), a claim 
challenged by PML office-bearers Sartaj Aziz and Mushahid Hussain who 
were present at the airport.

Nawaz Sharif, who too had gone to the airport to see off his father 
did not engage in the dispute.

After a great deal of bickering, the officials agreed to allow the PML 
leaders to check the ECL for themselves and it was established that it 
did not include Mr Sharifs name as had been claimed by the FIA 
officials.

incidents of violence.

A young MQM worker, who has been in hiding since the June 19, 1992, 
died. Police claimed that Rehman Ahmed was killed in a shootout with 
rangers and two other party workers, Mohammad Javed and Mohammad Aqil, 
were arrested.
    
The body of Rehman Ahmed was brought to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital 
for autopsy where doctors said he had been hit in the back from a very 
close range.

In another incident a MQM worker was killed in what the police said 
was an encounter. Three others, killed included a 10-year-old boy. 
Elsewhere in the city, three people were wounded in incidents of 
shooting.

In yet another incident two MQM workers were killed in what the police 
said were gunbattles. The parents of the two had earlier appealed to 
the President to save their lives.
    
Inquiries made by this reporter revealed that both had been in the 
custody of law enforcement agencies for the last two days and since 
their arrest, their relatives and neighbours had repeatedly visited 
rangers and police to find out their whereabouts.
    
Irshad Beg, who according to police, was sitting in a car during the 
shoot-out, was hit by four pistol bullets  three on the chest and one 
in the neck  all of which, according to doctors, were fired from a 
distance of just couple of yards.
    
Ankle and wrist injuries caused by fetters and handcuffs were clearly 
visible on Irshads body. The right-side of his forehead also bore an 
injury mark.
    
Yaseens body was also dotted with bullet wounds from chest to legs. A 
beating sign was clearly visible on his right ribs.
    
Some Sunday papers had also carried the report of the arrest of Irshad 
Beg and MQM leaders appealed to the President to save his life.

The reported arrest of several MQM workers in Karachi and Hyderabad in 
the last few days have been criticised by Mr Altaf Hussain who, in a 
statement issued here, said that indiscriminate raids by the rangers 
and police on the houses of his partys workers and leaders are 
continuing. Mr Hussain accused the government of not even showing any 
respect for the holy month of Ramazan and exceeding in its hostility 
against the Mohajirs, said the MQM leader.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent   

HYDERABAD, Feb. 7: The Pakistan Muslim League took out a procession 
from Market Chowk to condemn, what the protesters called, the murder 
of Sheikhu Rahu, the father-in-law of former Sindh minister and PML 
leader, Ismail Rahu.
    
The demonstrators demanded a judicial inquiry headed by a supreme 
court judge to probe into the death of Shaikhu Rahu who had died in 
the hospital with bar fetters, which were not removed even after his 
death.
    
They condemned the utterances of Sindh chief minister in which he had 
stated that the deceased was involved in heinous crimes and added that 
if even one crime was proved against him all of them would resign from 
PML.
    
They said it was shameful that the bar fetters were not removed even 
after his death.
    
They said that Shaikhu Rahus death was the fourth political murder in 
jail.

<a name="mqmt">MQM threatens to disrupt WC matches</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KARACHI, Feb. 2: The Mohajir Qaumi Movement warned the government it 
would disrupt the upcoming cricket World Cup unless it stopped 
security operations against the partys followers during the 
competition.
    
If the government continues raids, arrests and extra-judicial 
killings of our activists during the World Cup then we would go for 
strong protest. There is no other way out, a senior MQM leader, Ajmal 
Dehlavi, said.
    
Action would include strikes and boycotting the matches, he said.
    
DEHLAVIS  CLARIFICATION 

Talking to Dawn on telephone Mr Dehlavi denied having issued any 
threat to disrupt the World Cup matches.
 
We dont believe in such threats and agitation, said the MQM leader.
He said he had expressed his apprehensions that if custodial killings 
continued during the matches some people might react. That does not 
mean we have threatened to disrupt the World Cup, he emphasised.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb. 3: Chief of the MQM negotiating team Ajmal Dehlavi again 
denied that he or any other member of the MQM had threatened to 
disrupt the upcoming World Cup matches in Pakistan.
    
In a statement faxed to newspapers, Mr Dehlavi said a foreign news 
agency had circulated an exaggerated statement attributed to him, 
which had caused misunderstanding.
    
He said that in response to a question that he had said democratic 
right of strike was used in the face of continuing raids, arrests and 
custodial killings and it would be prudent that during the World Cup 
such operations were stopped so that the need for a protest did not 
arise.
    
He said the MQM was a peaceful and democratic party and could not 
think of jeopardising national interests.
    
The honour of Pakistan is very dear to us and the question of issuing 
threats to disrupt the World Cup does not arise. We dont believe in 
such threats and agitation, said Mr Dehlavi.
    
He said the MQM wanted to resolve all issues through negotiations and 
had advised the government to stop the operation and other anti-
Mohajir steps so there remained no justification for protest. But, it 
does not mean we have threatened to disrupt the World Cup.

<a name="rang">Rangers raid MPAs Hostel, Ishtiaqs residence</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb. 7: Heavy contingents of rangers searching for some MQM 
workers raided the MPAs Hostel in Azizabad and the city residence of 
Senator Ishtiaq Azhar.
    
The raids were carried out separately about the same time. Aftabur 
Rehman, a driver, was arrested at the hostel while no one was arrested 
in the raid on the Senators residence. 
   
The senator is in London. At the time of the raid his women relatives 
and a grandson were in the house.

The law enforces surrounded the Nine-Zero headquarters of the MQM 
about three in the morning and sealed all its exit and entry points. 
This was followed by a search of the nearby three-storey MPAs Hostel, 
where some of the MQM leaders and workers sleep at night.
    
The law enforces then moved all the MQM leaders and workers out of the 
building, and asked them to sit on the road, with their hands clasped 
on their heads. Deputy Opposition leader Shoaib Bokhari and former 
senior provincial minister and member of the MQM Co-ordination 
Committee Tariq Javed were among them.
    
A short while later a senior ranger official approached the MQM 
leaders and workers apologised to them and asked them to sit in a room 
of the hostel.
    
They later apologised to us for this treatment. They said they saw 
some armed men roaming in the hostel. It seems somebody has misguided 
them, deputy opposition leader Shoaib Bokhari told Dawn.

<a name="600m">600 MQM men in custody since July, says Babar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb. 2: Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar said that the law 
and order situation in Karachi had reached a tolerable level owing to 
administrative measures.
    
He said Over 600 MQM activists have been arrested and 70 killed. He 
said the success of law enforcement measures could be gauged from the 
substantial decline in death toll and incidents of terrorism.
    
About MQM allegations of custodial and extra-judicial killings, the 
minister said it was baseless and a figment of imagination. No one 
gets killed like that, he said adding, they are armed and when they 
see the law enforcement agencies, they open fire.
    
He did not agree with a questioner that Fahim Bhoora and Rahman were 
the victims of custodial killings.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="prud">Prudential regulations : SBP warns erring banks of action</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Feb. 4: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has warned the banks 
to refrain from violating its guidelines, or else be ready to face 
disciplinary action.
    
It said some of the banks were found violating Prudential Regulations 
quite frequently, adding the SBP had taken a serious view of the usual 
response of the banks to its instructions. The circular did not name 
the banks.
    
Although the circular neither disclosed the specifics of what it 
called the irregularities committed by the banks nor did it name the 
ones that did so, banking sources said, the warning was directed 
chiefly towards the government-run banks.
    
Banking sources said the SBP was particularly concerned with the 
expansion of infected loan portfolio that had already crossed the Rs 
100 billion mark.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Muhammad Aslam

KARACHI, Feb. 4: Trading on the bullion market resumed on a bullish 
note where prices surged to an all-time peak level of Rs 4,980 per 10 
grams.
    
Later, in kerb trading, it was quoted well above Rs 5,000 per 10 grams 
and there were more buyers than sellers. Bullion dealers said a margin 
of Rs 700 per 10 grams in the selling prices of the commodity in the 
two neighbouring markets is an attractive bait, which only fools could 
ignore.
    
In an identical development, rupee fell to the lowest level against 
the US currency in kerb trading and sold for Rs 36.40 to a dollar, 
surpassing the previous level of Rs 36.23 established when the rupee 
was officially devalued by seven percent on October 28 last year.
    
The buying and selling rates in kerb dealings were quoted at Rs 36.35 
and Rs 36.40 respectively and dealers reported large business at this 
level.
    
But there was no change in the official parity rates, which were 
quoted at Rs 34.33 and Rs 34.50 for buying and selling respectively.

KARACHI, Feb. 6: The rupee lost another 40 paisa against the dollar on 
the open market owing to heavy demand for the US currency.
    
The rupee on the open market was quoted at Rs 36.75 and Rs 36.80 for 
buying and selling, as compared to Sundays Rs 36.35 and Rs 36.40. In 
official dealing, the rupee stood unchanged at Rs 34.33 and Rs 34.50 
to a dollar.
    
Dealers said the current decline in the value of the rupee could take 
breather at Rs 37, but that if the fall in the Indian currency was 
contained within the current limits.
    
Unlike previous session, the increase in price of gold was nominal as 
investors were not inclined to push it further higher, partly because 
of the arrival of the fresh stocks from the foreign sources. The gold 
was last quoted at Rs 4,984 per 10 grams.

<a name="tens">Tension along LoC causes modest slashing of share prices</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Muhammad Aslam

After initial surge on active follow-up support, shares on the Karachi 
Stock Exchange later came in for modest slashing followed by selling 
spurred by news of tension of the line of control in Kashmir and 
reports of exchange of firing between the Indian and the Pakistani 
troops.   The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices, which at 
one stage soared to 1,626.39 after breaking the psychological barrier 
of 1,600 points once again retreated and was last quoted at 1,597.81 
as compared to 1,591.50 a week earlier.

The interesting thing was that the stock market has never been as 
active as it was during the current holy month of Ramazan as both the 
daily volume and the weekly turnover fighter have set new records at 
30 million on an average and 120 million shares, allaying fears of 
sluggishness associated with the holy month. It points to the presence 
of strong foreign support.

Investment shares again led the market advance, which generally rose 
under the lead of bank shares, notably Javed Omer, KASB & Co., 
Crescent Bank, Bank Al-Habib and some others.

Insurance shares ran into selling after last week's sustained rise and 
ended partially lower under the lead of Adamjee Insurance. But PIC 
maintained its upward drive on active support.

Synthetic shares were actively traded under the lead of Dhan Fibre and 
Ibrahim Fibre but gains were fractional.

Lucky Cement in cement sector and Hub Power and Sitara Energy in the 
energy sector were massively traded in each session and finished 
sharply higher and so did Cherat and Pakland Cement and KESC and 
Pakistan Refinery PSO rose by another Rs. 15 to quote well above the 
Rs.300 mark.

In chemicals, Dawood Hercules, Reckitt and Colman, Fauji Fertiliser 
and ICI Pakistan were among the leading gainers. Though PTC remained 
in strong demand in the transport sector and rose further on strong 
foreign buying.

Losses on the other had were mostly fractional and reflected slack 
demand.

Trading soared to 140 million shares from the last week's 118 million 
shares. Bulk of the alternate bouts of buying and selling were 
confined to Hub-Power, PTC vouchers and the newly turned active Lucky 
Cement, which together accounted for more than two third of the total 
volume.

Bulk of the alternate bouts of buying and selling were confined to Hub 
Power, PTC vouchers and the newly turned active Lucky Cement, which 
together accounted for more than two third of the total volume.

Hub-Power, and PTC vouchers however, firmly held on to their recently 
attained higher levels despite larger selling and there is perception 
that they have the potential to rise further after passing through 
necessary corrections.

Lucky Cement also attracted profit-selling at the inflated level and 
finished with some of the initial gains clipped.

Faysal Bank traded heavily but price changes were mostly fractional.    
Fauji Fertiliser, ICI Pakistan, TriPack Films, Dhan Fibre, Sitara 
Energy, EFU General Insurance, Kohinoor Power and Kohinoor Energy, 
Askari Bank, LTV Modaraba after news that it was selected to bid for 
the Bankers Equity and Bank of Punjab were among the other actively 
traded shares.

Others shares, which came in for active support at the lower levels 
included Maple Leaf Cement, Mohib Textiles, 25th ICP mutual fund, Bank 
Al-Habib, and KASB & Company.

KARACHI, Feb. 6: Stocks prices surged further higher under the lead of 
blue chips as a section of leading investors made fresh heavy covering 
purchases at the lower levels.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100-share finished with an 
extended gain of 20.19 points at 1,652.13 as compared to 1,631.94, 
reflecting the strength of the base shares.
    
The market advance was led by the energy sector where all the shares 
were actively traded and rose sharply under the lead of PSO, Kohinoor 
Power, Mari Gas Pakistan Refinery and Pakistan Oilfields, rising 
sharply.
    
But the bone of contention between the foreign and local buyers again 
remained Hub-Power, which not only traded massively but also attained 
the coveted mark of Rs 30.
    
Bank shares followed them, which rose modestly but sustained the early 
gains, notable gainers among the being Crescent, Citicorp  Faysal 
Bank, Askari Bank and some others.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Feb. 7: A near-bullish conditions prevailed on the Karachi 
Stock Exchange as the index gained another 36 points on heavy indexed 
share buying.
    
The KSE 100-share index was last quoted at 1,687.81, about 12 points 
short of its chart point of 1,700 points as compared to 1,652.13 a day 
earlier.
    
GDR related shares, notably PTC vouchers and Hub-Power led the market 
advance, which were not only massively traded in each session 
accounting for more than a half of the total volume.
    
But the bone of contention among the leading investors both local and 
foreign were the energy shares, which attracted heavy buying at the 
lower levels and ended recovered under the lead of Sui Northern, Mari 
Gas, Pakistan Refinery and PSO.

Bank shares followed them under the lead of Faysal Bank whose 
directors have announced a cash dividend of five percent and bonus 
shares at the rate of 10 per cent for the year ended Dec. 31, 1995. 
Al-Faysal Bank, MCB, Bank of Punjab and some others were among the 
best gainers. After early rise, Citicorp, however, fell sharply but 
for no apparent reason.

Among mutual funds, ICP SEMF was heavily traded and ended sharply 
higher and so did some of the modarabas under the lead of Imrooz and 
Askari and some other leasing shares.
    
In the synthetic sector, Dhan Fibre was actively traded and so did 
some others but gains were fractional. Auto shares rose in unison on 
news of higher production, with Honda Atlas and Pak-Suzuki being in 
the forefront of gainers.
    
Chemical and pharma shares showed divergent trend as some of the MNCs 
attracted selling and ended lower under the lead of Dawood Hercules, 
ICI Pakistan, and some others but Cyanamid Pakistan, Searle Pakistan, 
Engro Chemicals, Fauji Fertiliser, Glaxo Lab after 12.5 per cent 
interim dividend and Reckitt and Colman, which rose sharply.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 65 paisa on 
12.170m shares followed by Hub-Power, higher 45 paisa on 11.376m 
shares, Lucky Cement steady 30 paisa on 1.187m shares, Faysal Bank, up 
Rs 3.10 on 1.056m shares, Dhan Fibre, firm 20 paisa on 0.763m shares, 
EFU General Insurance, higher Rs 2.50 on 0.479m shares, Fauji 
Fertilisers, up Rs 2.50 on 0.321m shares and LTV Modaraba, steady 15 
paisa on 0.242m shares. There were several other notable deals also.

Trading volume rose further to 39.940m shares from the overnight 
28.1280 million shares thanks to heavy dealings in the current 
favourites.

There were 311 actives, out of which 151 shares posted good gains, 
while 94 fell, with 66 holding on to the last levels.

</a>State terrorism-II
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee

FOR the record, this is the story of the murder of Ghulam Hussain 
Unnar, a victim of state terrorism. This will not bring Unnar back to 
life, but is written in the hope that it may help save other 
endangered lives, that it may get through to a few of our callous 
individuals glued to their seats of power, and make them sit up and 
think.
    
Those responsible for the death of Unnar include the 130 million 
acquiescent apathetic people of Pakistan who allow themselves to be 
trampled upon, and suffer anything that a fairly or foully elected or 
otherwise entrenched government metes out to them, and make not a 
whimper in protest.
    
Ghulam Hussain Unnar was the hereditary chieftain of the Unnar tribe. 
He was born on March 3, 1949, in his tribal village of Ali Abad, 
Taluka Dokri, in the district of Larkana, into a family of Sindhi 
politicians in whose veins flows the same blood as in those of the 
other tribals  the Jatois, the Legharis, the Khuhros, the Bhuttos, 
the Junejos, the Jat Baloch, the Shahs, the Syeds, and the rest. He 
was as well brought up as were they, schooled in wadera-shahi ways, 
taught to be a zamindar, a rustler, a private jail owner, a camel 
thief, or a politician.
    
In the 1985 partyless elections, Unnar stood for the provincial 
assembly and was elected from PS-34, Larkana 6. During the years 1985 
to 1988 he was both MPA and a member of the District Council. In the 
1988 elections he stood on a PPP ticket and was elected once more to 
the provincial assembly. He was elected chairman of the Larkana 
district council in 1989, and appointed as its administrator in 1992.
    
Though in jail (the Bokhari leg-bomb case in which, among others, he 
and Asif Zardari stood co-accused) during 1990 elections, he stood 
again on a PPP ticket and was elected. Jam Sadiq, when he became chief 
minister of Sindh, later released him, whereafter he and Asif fell 
out. Unnar formed the Larkana Alliance which, in 1992, was merged 
into the Muslim League (Functional Group). He contested the 1993 
elections on an ML ticket and quite naturally lost, but by only 2,000 
votes. Unnar claimed it was due to rigging, and who is to disbelieve 
him.
    
So, he lay in a variety of political beds, and at the advent of 
Benazirs second coming he emerged as a popular politician on the 
wrong side of the fence.
    
Between November 1993 and February 1994, 17 anti-corruption cases were 
brought against him, for 14 of which he managed to get bail before 
arrest from the Sindh High Court, and for the remaining three bail 
from the special anti-corruption court in Larkana. Between February 
and June 1994 he was detained four times under the Maintenance of 
Public Order Ordinance.
    
The blind FIR cycle of arrests was brought into play against him in 
July 1994, and it kept him continuously in custody until December 5, 
1995. The blind FIR (first information report) system is operated by 
Station House Officers who have bought their stations (the purchasing 
having been acknowledged by none less than the President of the 
Republic). In league with these SHOs are some officials of Karachi 
Central Prison. These 16 or so capi of the underworld are selected, 
protected and they effectively co-ordinate and act as manipulated by 
the Capo di capi of Islamabad.
    
A blind FIR is an FIR for which no case can possibly be made. It can 
be used in the so-called blind system to hold in remand those that 
the authorities wish to harass for political or vengeful or other 
reasons. A capo whips out a dormant case file, asks his obliging 
magistrate to remand the victim in his custody for 14 days (maximum 
permissible) for interrogation, at the end of which he pronounces 
his suspect to be innocent and releases him. But before the victim is 
freed, another capo takes over and the cycle continues till the Capo 
di Capi feels the victim has had enough.
    
At the end of 1994, a very sick and exhausted Unnar appealed to the 
President for relief, and sent copies of his appeal to all those who 
he thought might help. No relief was given, instead he was charged 
with sedition by the Chief Minister of Sindh. He applied for bail in 
the sedition case which was opposed by the government at all stages. 
He appealed to the Supreme Court, where too his plea was vehemently 
opposed by advocate-general Manghi of Sindh, but was granted by 
Justices Mamoon Kazi and Jehangir Bashiri on December 19, 1995.
    
Now to how Unnar was murdered. He was a heart patient, he had 
undergone bypass surgery in 1986, and since then, though under 
constant medical care, was fit enough to travel, electioneer, 
conspire, intrigue and lead a normal Pakistani politicians life. On 
March 23, 1994, Justice Mamoon Kazi, then of the Sindh High Court, 
bailed him out. Unnar walked away free but only up to the lift of the 
High Court where he was re-arrested by the police, not told why, and 
escorted to the anti-corruption establishment from where a minion 
telephoned some high-ups triumphantly announcing Unnars re-arrest. He 
was later taken to Preedy Police Station and kept there for seven days 
and denied medication and diet food from home. Thereafter the sick 
Unnar was flown to Larkana and lodged in the District Jail, again with 
no medicines and diet food.
    
On April 3, an appeal was made to Chief Justice of the Sindh High 
Court Nasir Aslam Zahid, who there and then ordered that Unnar be 
examined by a medical board, which was done on April 4. The Board 
recommended that he be hospitalised forthwith and the CJ ordered so on 
April 8. His orders were disregarded, and a contempt application had 
to be filed on April 12. CJ Zahid reprimanded the authorities and a 
very ill Unnar was taken to the Larkana hospital on April 15. On April 
16, 1994, Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid was removed from his post as Chief 
Justice of the SHC and he took his oath as a member of the Shariat 
Court.
    
On July 27, a police party arrived from Karachi with a remand order 
and despite the doctors protestations, he was transported to Karachi 
before dawn on the 28th. On the way, an Edhi ambulance had to be 
summoned to administer oxygen. By the time he arrived in Karachi he 
was so ill that there was no alternative but to take him straight to 
the NICVD where he was admitted to the ICU. He was later moved to a 
room, where he remained in custody until freed 18 months late on 
December 19, 1995.
    
His heart, and naturally his general condition, continued to 
deteriorate at an alarming pace. His doctors consistently recommended 
that he be released and flown abroad for treatment unavailable in 
Pakistan. In November 1994, a medical board (Professors Azhar Faruqui 
and Sultan Shah) was appointed by the government and it categorically 
stated that the only chance for Unnars survival was to immediately 
fly him abroad for a heart transplant.
    
Unnars various appeals for release on bail fell on deaf ears, or were 
not heard at all, for want of time, or for other excuses, by the Sindh 
High Court.
    
Every relevant and concerned person in authority knew well that 
Unnars implication and detention in some 63 cases were purely 
vindictive and that he was being held, proper medical treatment and 
succour denied to him, on the orders of as they say, the high-ups. 
By the time Unnar was released on bail in December 1995 he was far too 
sick to be flown abroad and was admitted to the Aga Khan hospital 
where his heart finally gave way on January 25.
    
His death came about through systematic state terrorism. In short, he 
was murdered. Most culpable are those who could have intervened and 
seen to it that he was given a chance to survive. Those who abused 
their authority and are responsible for his death include but are not 
limited to, the power wielders in Islamabad as well as in Karachi.
    
To add insult to injury, APP released to the Press, on January 26, 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos message in which she expressed her 
sense of grief... and she prayed to Almighty Allah to rest the 
departed soul in the eternal peace.
    
Any citizen reading this column may for no fault of his one day well 
fall foul of the despots, and be Unnarised. Speak out, protest, 
shake yourselves out of your apathy, your stupor, and stand up and be 
counted.

<a name="thee">The empire of the yobs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

AS SO often in the past Asif Zardari, our radical answer to Denis 
Thatcher, has got it just right. Win the World Cup, he has told our 
cricketing boys, and for each member of the team there will be a plot 
in Islamabad and a hefty cash prize. This is the language that our 
cricketing champions understand best and the language, that of naked 
money, which no one is in a position to speak better than Mr Zardari.
    
That our cricketing heroes, sharp about their interests, respond to 
nothing more readily than to the power of such blandishments is pretty 
well established by what the nation knows of them. But it had to take 
someone with Asif Zardaris keen understanding of what moves the 
spirit of endeavour in the Pakistani nation today to have put the 
matter in so straightforward a fashion. As for sportsmanship and the 
nonsense that some of us were taught at school about the important 
thing being not to win but to play the game well, these are notions 
with which neither the cricket team nor Asif Zardari, who in the last 
few years has proved his flair for high business, would have much 
patience.
    
To put the matter in perspective, just imagine Hillary Clinton or 
Denis Thatcher (for the younger Zardari in protocol terms is their 
equivalent) promising cash and real estate prizes to the American and 
British Olympic teams. There would be such an uproar in their 
respective countries that the very mountains would shake. Compare this 
with the standards of propriety prevailing in the Islamic Republic. 
Pakistans Denis Thatcher makes an announcement that in any other 
country would earn him a time in the stocks. Here it elicits not the 
smallest surprise. On the contrary, most people would be inclined to 
think that since in the Republic everything moves with the power of 
money, what is wrong with applying the same principle to the field of 
sports?
    
Perhaps not much except that where someone in a position of authority 
(as opposed to someone in a private capacity) feels not the slightest 
qualm in making so blatant an appeal to someones sense of greed, this 
says something about the cultural standards prevailing in that place 
or country. In Europe the culture of the typical football enthusiast 
is confined to a distinct section of the population. An Oxford don, 
say, in normal circumstances would not be expected to behave like a 
football lout. Consider our luck, therefore, where the cultural 
attitudes of the highest and the most privileged in the land are no 
better than what they would be of the certified yob in more favoured 
climes.
    
Consider in this regard a few choice examples. It takes a special 
cultural attitude to take a fashion troupe on a state visit to a 
foreign country as Ms Bhutto did when she visited Washington. In most 
other nations the compulsions behind such a move would just not be 
understood. Chirac taking a circus to Washington. Helmut Kohl taking a 
dancing troupe to Beijing. The very idea leaves the mind reeling. 
Self-respecting nations would be hard put to even dream of such 
preposterous notions. Yet Ms Bhutto did not bat an eyelid when she 
took a fashion tamasha, organised by Ms Raana Shaikh, to the US.
    
As if that was not enough, a series of cultural shows, again 
choreographed by the inevitable Ms Shaikh, are being organised for the 
Cricket World Cup. When any country hosts a big sporting event it 
tries its best to improve the facilities that will be on offer both to 
sportsmen and spectators. Sprucing up the cities where cricket matches 
are going to be held seems beyond our national capacity. So what we 
are doing instead is to arrange basant melas and the like which will 
pass for cultural shows. The only thing that remains to be done is to 
ask Fakhar Zaman to hold a history conference, or some of the other 
delicious scams he is so good at organising, to go with the World Cup.
    
In this atmosphere of all-round national sophistication, is it 
surprising then that if Mr Asif Zardari wants to inspire our cricket 
team he should have recourse to a language which comes to him 
naturally and which has the added merit of being the only language 
which our players can understand? Imagine Mr Zardari of all people 
speaking of the glory of playing the game well and impressing upon our 
cricketing yobs the need to conduct themselves well. The very scene is 
improbable.
    
For a language of exhortation to be effective it must be attuned to 
the mental and social attitudes of those to whom it is addressed. 
Speaking to men of honour you appeal to their sense of honour. It is 
no use employing the same language with shopkeepers, real estate 
agents, car dealers and the like who, although they perform vital 
functions in modern society, are moved more by the expectation of 
profit than by references to integrity.
    
In Homer the most prized qualities in a man rest on his ability to 
excel in war and to excel in debate because prowess in both mattered 
to the Greeks. Invocations to honour are hardly relevant in a country 
where swindling the public purse and using public office to pursue 
private interests have become the highest art forms. In such a mileu 
the only appeals that can be made, if you want people to do their 
best, is to their self-interest. If you want justice you have to pay 
for it. If you want the police to register a case you pay the police. 
If you want a land deed from a patwari you make a suitable offering to 
him. If you want a high-level contract you cut a deal with those who 
matter. If you want something in the Punjab PPP you propitiate Ms 
Naheed Khan. 

Everything in the Islamic Republic has a price these days and provided 
you are able and willing to pay it, the sky is the limit as far as 
your reach is concerned. Why should the cricket team be an exception? 
Instead of being censured Asif Zardari deserves to be complimented on 
his wisdom for hitting upon the one argument calculated to send the 
adrenaline surging in our cricketing champions.

<a name="univ">University reforms</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

SINCE 1989 when the Pakistan government invited the World Bank to 
study and recommend reforms in the higher education sector, the 
authorities have been pondering the issue. In 1994, an eleven-member 
Pakistani group with two foreign consultants presented a report 
containing the draft of new legislation pertaining to higher 
education. One of he laws to be amended is the University Act which 
has regulated the working of the institutions of higher learning in 
the public sector since 1972.

Slow as the process of change traditionally is in the country, this 
draft is still under debate. It has come into public notice because 
differences have developed between the university teachers and the 
vice-chancellors whose committee has suggested some amendments in the 
draft which would enhance their powers. The VCs want the Syndicate to 
have more nominated members than has been proposed. The teachers are 
opposing this suggestion. It will reduce their participation in the 
university management, more so because the Senate, the main statutory 
body of which all university professors are members, will be 
abolished.

What is at stake is the democratic principle in university management. 
In that context, these two moves namely, to abolish the Senate and 
increase the nominated element might not find favour with many. The 
Senate with its multitudinous composition can claim to be fairly 
representative, but for that reason it is unwieldy as well. Moreover, 
the Senate has failed to play the role expected of it. It is required 
to meet twice a year under the University Act but usually it doesnt. 

In the eighties the Senates of various universities did not meet for 
years. Hence its replacement by a smaller and more cohesive body which 
would be in a position to act more effectively makes sense. But that 
does not mean that the Senate should be replaced by a very small and 
pliable body which act as a rubber stamp of the university 
authorities. If most of its members are ex-officio or nominated by the 
VC, as is being proposed, it would concentrate too much power in the 
hands of the vice-chancellors. It is this feature of the proposed 
university legislation that has come up against resistance. The World 
Bank mission which first looked into the matter and suggested the 
abolition of the Senate had also proposed strong representation of the 
professionals on the reconstituted Syndicate. It was, however, not 
categorical about the mode of appointment.

As is widely recognised, one major factor in the malaise in our 
universities is the excessive concentration of power at the apex 
leve1. The vice chancellors tend to be too authoritarian and do not 
attach much importance to consensus or relish diversity of opinion. In 
theory this might make their task easier, given the politicisation and 
militarisation of the campuses have resulted in polarisation among 
students and teachers communities.

When he is in a position to exercise absolute power, the VC can 
enforce discipline and implement policy challenge without being 
required to create a consensus and enlist the co-operation of the 
teachers and students he has to work with. The World Bank study 
describes the teachers and students organisations as pressure groups 
and asks for their reduced role in the Syndicate.

But in practice this approach can prove counter-productive. In the 
first place, it gives one individual total control of the institution. 
This is not a very desirable prospect to favour since checks and 
balances should be in-built in the working of institutions, especially 
of the kind the universities are. They should not be deprived of the 
benefit of plurality of opinion which a governing body with diverse 
membership offers. Besides, a Syndicate comprising the vice-
chancellor's nominees would enable irregularities and lapses to go 
unchecked. It is also important that the teachers who actually deliver 
the goods should be associated with policy-making in the universities. 
To dismiss their bodies as pressure groups is not correct. If they are 
seen to be behaving as trade unionists which at times they do it would 
be wiser to counteract their influence by including other neutral 
parties in the syndicate rather than excluding teachers' 
representatives altogether.    This aspect of the matter must be kept 
in view when the universities are restructured. Thus the Syndicate 
must consist of various teachers' bodies which are represented, such 
as the teachers societies, college principals and others, should 
choose their own nominees. Apart from these, other professional bodies 
such as the organisations of lawyers, doctors, journalists, 
accountants, trade and industry, should be given representation and 
they should be asked to nominate their representatives themselves. 
This will give the universities a strong and diverse input of public 
opinion in its policy making. This would not be possible if the 
element of representation in the management of universities is further 
constricted or dispensed with altogether.

THE MQM's Ajmal Dehlavi has denied a statement attributed to him by a 
foreign agency that his organisation would disrupt the forthcoming 
World Cup cricket matches in Karachi if the government did not stop 
security operations against MQM workers.

 Mr Dehlavi was quoted as saying: "If the government continues raids, 
arrests and extra-judicial killings of our activists during the World 
Cup, we would go for strong protest. There is no, other way out." 
Contacted by Dawn, Mr Dehlavi denied having made any threat or even 
talked to any correspondent of the agency concerned. At the same time, 
he said he had expressed his apprehensions that if custodial killings 
continued during the matches, some people might react.

The World Cup is, not a government-organised affair. Every Pakistani 
feels involved in it and considers it a singular honour that Pakistani 
has won the right to host some of the Cup fixtures as well as the 
final. Pakistan are the defending champion, and, therefore, public 
interest in the event is even keener. It would be tragic if anything 
were to happen to mar the smooth holding of World Cup matches, which 
promise to provide a break from the cheerless daily routine of our 
lives. The militant Shiv Sena in India has previously been known to 
have made such threats at the possibility of Pakistan playing in that 
country, and we are sure that the MQM would not like to be in such 
ignoble company. There have already been whispers abroad that 
countries like Pakistan are not capable of  holding international-
level events like the World Cup, if anyone here deliberately sets out 
to disrupt the coming matches, he will only be proving the Cassandras 
right. Moreover, far from extracting any political mileage out of such 
action, any organisation or group that interferes with the smooth 
course of the World Cup or seeks, political concessions through cruse 
blackmail will only be losing public sympathy and run the danger of 
its cause suffering incalculable damage.  Even the people of Karachi 
would like to have their cricket kept above the political 
confrontation that rocks their city.

The MQM does not need the World Cup to remind us of the urgency of 
finding a political solution to the Karachi crisis. Custodial killings 
and harassment by security agencies have been criticised throughout 
the country. The Press has written about such happenings and 
politicians have spoken out against them. The government has denied 
all allegations and entertained that it is only combating terrorists 
and terrorism.   But it is upto the nations interest to ensure that 
arbitrary acts by the agencies operating in Karachi expressly stopped 
and the law respected. It has been said before but bears repetition 
that the state cannot stoop to the same intemperate level as 
terrorists and trouble-makers.

The World Cup may provide an occasion for both the government and the 
MQM to create an atmosphere of harmony, refrain from words or deeds 
likely to provoke the side and play the political game according to 
rules. The MQM often claims that it controls Karachi now is the time 
for it to offer to ensure fully enthusiastic and peaceful popular 
participation in an event to which Pakistanis look forward with great 
excitement.

WITH the security situation so volatile in the region which is hosting 
the Sixth Cricket World Cup, any lapse on this front anywhere is bound 
to create a stir in the concerned quarters. Already the devastating 
blast in Sri Lanka has exposed the enormity and intensity of the 
problem. In India the lunatic fringe spearheaded by Bal Thackray poses 
a threat that simply cannot be ignored. From the security point of 
view, Pakistan is considered relatively safe though not entirely free 
from fears of disruption during the big sporting event. Given this 
sensitive scenario, the storming of the Bagh-i-Jinnah ground by an 
unruly crowd of intruders and spectators leading to the preparatory 
match being abandoned half-way through is an ominous. The fact that 
the cream of the country's cricket and members of the World Cup squad 
had to put up   with the rowdy scenes created by the rampaging crowd 
did not speak very well of the security arrangements.

Ironically, when all this was happening in Lahore the federal interior 
minister was holding fort in Karachi on the foolproof measures taken 
to prevent any mishap during the World Cup matches. Both the Manager 
and the Captain of the team are on record having said that despite 
their frantic appeals to the police authorities satisfactory response 
was not available, with the result that the game proceedings had to be 
halted and eventually abandoned. In view of the fact that Lahore is 
going to be the centre for most of the scheduled 16 matches, the Bagh-
i-Jinnah episode cannot and should not be treated lightly. The 
Pakistan Cricket Board must take up the matter at the highest 1evel to 
ensure that no such untoward incidents mar the show.

NOT many people agree with the government's approach to charity. 
Although the zakat system had been established in 1979 to provide 
financial assistance to the poor and the deserving, the government of 
the day found it necessary to set up another institution for the same 
purpose in 1992. That was the Baitul Maal which was also designed to 
dole out money to people who were certified as being needy by the 
various committees set up for the purpose. Needless to say, this 
approach of handing out charity to the poorsometimes at highly 
publicised ceremonies has not eliminated poverty one bit in Pakistan. 

Take the case of the Baitul Maal. In 1994-95 it was allocated Rs.1.1 
billion and it helped about three million families. What each person 
received a pittance. Thus the sum of Rs. 150 per month doled out to 
needy family would mean no more than a tiny drop of relief for it; it 
would neither meet its subsistence needs fully or alleviate its utter 
indigence.

It is, therefore, heartening that wisdom has at last dawned on the 
authorities and there is talk of the Baitul Maal's schemes being 
revamped. The underlying principle appears to be that giving out 
charity to people does not help them lift themselves from the abyss of 
poverty and want. They continue to be poor and dependent on the 
assistance of others. It might also be added that charity of this kind 
also robs them of their self esteem and the incentive to generate a 
living for themselves and be self-reliant. So far so good. But what 
might be questioned is the wisdom of all the schemes the Baitul Maal 
authorities have now announced with a fanfare.

They appear to be far too ambitious and are so widely dispersed that 
it is doubtful if they will ever make an impact. According to what has 
been said, technical workshops are to be set up in 175 selected 
schools, 35 pre-schools are being opened to provide two years of 
schooling to poor children, and orphanages patterned on the SOS 
village scheme will be up in every district. Considering  the fact 
that the Baitul Maal's allocation for the year 1995-96 has been 
slashed from Rs 1.l billion to Rs 300 million in 1995-96, these 
schemes are likely to come up against the problem of poor funding and 
fail to render effective assistance to the children who are intended 
to benefit from them. Obviously, the resources will be spread too thin 
to create much of an impact. The object seems to be to make the Baitul 
Maal's activities more visible than meaningful.

For instance, setting up new schools in low-income areas is basically 
the job of the education authorities. It makes little sense that the 
education system should be bypassed and the Baitul Maal should be 
running its own institutions which will be operating outside the 
mainstream. Such fanciful experiments have been tried before 
ostensibly to promote literacy and education and they have come to 
naught. What did the Nai Roshni schools achieve and how many people 
ever remember them now? If the government is serious about educating 
the children of the poor, it should open primary schools in large 
numbers in the slums of the cities and the rural areas so that they 
are accessible to the poor. The Baitul Maal could give a helping hand 
not so much in meeting the capital cost as in the operation of these 
institutions for the benefit of the poor. This would also require the 
Baitul Maal to provide scho1arships to needy pupils, give them free 
lunches and even support to the families to encourage them to send 
their children to school and not to require them to work for a living 
some of which it has proposed to do.

Similarly, giving medical assistance to individuals may amount to 
selecting a few cases out of thousands and handing out favours to 
them. As can be imagined, the corruption that goes into any selection 
process knows no bounds. Instead, health institutions which are known 
to be providing service to the poor should be helped. If the Baitul 
Maal wants, it can assume sponsorship of deserving cases already 
receiving care. This would restrict the scope for corruption. Neither 
would it then be possible for the zakat committee members who 
recommend the names of people in need of help to use their position 
for personal gain.

It is time the government redefined its policy vis-`-vis poverty 
alleviation. The task must be approached in all seriousness, devoid of 
gimmickry and projection glitz, and with more meaningful strategies so 
that a dent can be made in the poverty situation in the country.</pre><hr><pre>

Samiul Hasan

Every one knows how great he used to be. But, how much a long period 
of absence from the game can take out of a player is yet to be seen.

Cricket wizard Javed Miandad is all set to play the World Cup and 
intends to retire soon after. Pakistan's finest batsman obviously 
wants to make his farewell a memorable one.

"I have planned to say goodbye to international cricket after the 
World Cup. But I think the best goodbye party I can have will be when 
Pakistan retains the World Cup," says the former Pakistan captain.

"I think I have been misunderstood by certain quarters. I am not 
playing the World Cup because I want to establish some sort of a 
record. I am only anxious to play because I think I can still deliver 
the goods. Also, I think I had some contribution in the 1992 glory. I 
want to repeat those performances and consequently see Pakistan finish 
at the top."

Miandad maintains that he had a desire to create a couple of records. 
"But those dreams were shattered when I missed 17 Tests and 38 one-day 
internationals in the last 24 months.

Why did he become available for the World Cup after being out of 
commission for two years and chiefly because of knee injury. In his 
defence Miandad points out that though he was physically fit for the 
tour Down Under, he stayed away because he was neither match-fit nor 
was he mentally prepared. "I wanted to give myself enough time to get 
into good physical shape so that when I enter the field, I am not 
treated as a liability.

"The other thing which forced me to give my availability was the 
lacklustre performance of the batsmen in the home series against Sri 
Lanka, on the Sharjah tour and, then on the tour Down Under. The 
talent was definitely there but void of any experience.

Miandad stresses that he never manipulated to get himself selected. 
"My selection was purely done on merit though I agree that I had made 
the job of the selectors quite easy by scoring 74 not out, 20, 53 and 
44 in the Wills Cup."

Miandad, revealing about the secret of 1992 victory, says: "We played 
every game as the final. It lifted our performances. Earlier in the 
tournament, we ware quite casual in a couple of opening games, 
thinking that we can cover up initial defeats by winning at the later 
stage. We were mistaken.

"I think, the same policy should be adopted in this World Cup. But 
honestly, no strategy has been formed yet."

About Pakistan's chances, Miandad says they are quite bright. "But 
there will be enormous pressure on our team because we are the 
defending champions and are playing in front of our own crowd. If we 
can sustain that pressure, I don't see why we cannot retain the 
title."

<a name="unpr">Unpredictable Pakistan may retain World Cup</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmad

LONDON: Despite their richness in talent and the glut of the never-
ending production line of promising players, Pakistan, one of the top-
ranking cricketing nation of the world, remains the most unpredictable 
and as such the most vulnerable of teams. In all the last five World 
Cup competitions they enjoyed the honour of being tagged as one of the 
favourites as did Australia, England and the West Indies.
   
Poor fielding, inconsistency in their  batting line-up and their 
failures to rise to the occasion dashed their ambitions to reach the 
final of the first four tournaments. The West Indies became the only 
team to win two cups in a row in 1975, the inaugural competition and 
the 1979 final. India then toppled them in the 1983 final at Lords 
under Kapil Dev and when the Australians, led by Allan Border, gored 
them at the Gaddafi Stadium in the semi-final of the 1987 World Cup, 
they were once again left in the cold.
   
The 1992 World Cup played in Australia and New Zealand saw much the 
same pattern as far as Pakistan was concerned. Injury suffered by 
Waqar Younis in the warm-up games prior to the Cup matches came as a 
big blow but thankfully Javed Miandad who was left out from the 
original squad by Imran Khan, the World Cup captain for dubious 
reasons, was inducted in the team as an afterthought as public 
pressure mounted. His inclusion transformed Pakistan beyond ones 
imagination. So did the batting of Inzamam-ul-Haq, Ramiz Raja and 
Imran himself.
   
>From a position of hopelessness, Pakistan suddenly started to emerge 
to destroy even teams like Australia and New Zealand who had started 
to pose the biggest threat.
   
Whereas teams consisting of all-rounders and attacking batsmen like 
the West Indians, Australians, Indians and South Africans floundered, 
Pakistan made steady recovery after disappointing start to reach the 
final and then beat England by 22 runs at MCG in front of over 80,000 
people. It was a memorable moment and every Pakistani present at the 
ground and those at home and overseas were proud of the achievement 
which seemed a distance away only a few days ago.
   
A defeat at the hands of the West Indians by 10 wickets, a narrow 
escape at Adelaide against England after being bowled out for 74 when 
rain saved them was not a type of beginning that Pakistan had planned 
for. India and South Africa also brought them to their knees. Only a 
win against Zimbabwe was what Pakistan could boast of.
   
Their back-to-back win against Australia and Sri Lanka and their most 
exciting encounters against  New Zealand at Christchurch and Auckland 
in the semi-final against New Zealand miraculously changed all that.
   
The day-and-night game at MCG against England in the final was the day 
when Pakistan were the better team. They batted to their potential. 
Imran Khan, Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul-Haq being the stars of that 
bright night as were Ramiz Raja, Aamir Sohail and Wasim Akram. The 
present captain  Wasim Akrams two deliveries mattered in the final 
reckoning. It might have come from above, that is what many thought 
but  Akram has bowled many like that since and is most likely to be at 
his best once again. He has a team, the talent and the advantage of 
being the champions.
   
Revolts, rebellions against their own captains, bickering on matters 
not even related to the game but the social  side of it, the 
allegations of ball tampering, the drug scandal in the island of 
Grenada which involved Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Aqib Javed and 
Mushtaq Ahmed on their tour of the Caribbean in 1993 had taken its 
toll since.
   
Since their World Cup triumph in 1992, although they remained 
successful at the Test level, their performance in limited-overs 
cricket has not really been up to the standard of a team which has the 
title of the champions of one-day cricket.
   
Off and on Pakistan were able to show glimpses of what they are 
capable of doing and that is when they were in right frame of mind, 
leaving aside the politics of the game which now and again plagues 
them.
   
As champions, now they have a lot to prove. The team that has been 
picked is the best available with the added advantage of the inclusion 
of Javed Miandad, the most experienced, the most versatile who will be 
playing his sixth World Cup to become the only one to do that. The 
highest run-maker in the World Cup history, he is the one who will be 
watched with interest because he will matter most in times of crisis.
   
Inzamam, the most improved and established batsman in the side, will 
be the kingpin and so would Aamir Sohail, Ramiz Raja and the ever-
threatening Salim Malik who can devastate any form of bowling on his 
day.
   
Mushtaq Ahmed, Saqlain Mushtaq, Waqar Younis and Aaqib Javed would be 
as much looking forward to it as is Rashid Latif. It is an 
allrounders game and Pakistan, if plays to its full potential can 
prove that.
   
They are an unpredictable lot, they might even fade out before the 
real things start to happen or they may emerge once again to fulfil 
their cherished desire to retain the Cup.

<a name="sala">Salahuddin hopeful of Pakistan's chances</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KARACHI, Feb. 2: A member of the national cricket selection committee, 
Salahuddin Ahmed, has expressed optimism that Pakistan would retain 
World Cup title.

He said, being selector I am confident that God willing our team will 
retain its title in the coming cricket extravaganza". We have picked 
up the best possible lot of talented cricketers.

Salahuddin was of the view that the World Cup squad was a balanced 
one, and, it had the potential to rise to the occasion and retain 
their title. "Our batting line-up is world class. I am confident that 
with their joint efforts and team spirit, we will be able to come up 
to the expectations of the whole nation", he added.

The national selector opined that blessings are always helpful in the 
success of our team in the holy month of Ramazan. The team would 
certainly get the blessings from the nation, but besides that we need 
hard work, courage and devotion to take on the teams in the league 
matches and make way for the semi-final and final.

The team has some fielding weakness, but under the supervision of 
Manager Intekhab Alam, it would improve day-by-day.

<a name="arif">Arif Abbasi sad over Lahore incident</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sports Correspondent 

LAHORE, Feb. 3: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chief Executive Arif 
Abbasi said that 5,000-7,000 tickets will be sold to enthusiasts at 
every venue of the World Cricket Cup matches in Pakistan. He had 
handed over the tickets to the National Bank (NBP) for sale.

Mr Abbasi, while replying to questions from the media people, said 
that the capacity of the Qadhafi Stadium had been raised to 30,000. He 
added: It was not possible to increase the capacity further. It could 
have caused an accident like the one which occurred at Nagpur, killing 
many and injuring many people.

The PCB official expressed his sorrow at the incident at the Bagh-i-
Jinnah which led to the abandonment of the match between Pakistan team 
and PIA Combined Eleven. He said that the PCB had only hired the 
venue, and making the necessary arrangements was the duty of the 
management. If it failed in its duty it was not the fault of the PCB.

Abbasi said in view of the sad incident, the England teams practice 
matches would have to be shifted to some other ground.

Abbasi said that security and other arrangements for the World Cup 
have been given to specialists. It was impossible to guarantee hundred 
per cent safety of the teams. Still he hoped that adequate measures 
would be taken to avoid any untoward incident. He said professional 
agencies were taking care of all aspects of organisation of the World 
Cup matches and he saw no problem arising during the games.

<a name="ptvn">PTV not to show opening ceremony </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Feb. 5: Cricket enthusiasts, interested in watching the 
opening ceremony of the World Cup, should start installing dish 
antennas at their residences because the Pakistan Television 
Corporation (PTV) will not be televising it.
    
According to well placed sources, the WorldTel has demanded US $ 
200,000 from the government run organisations if it was interested in 
getting the pictures live from Eden Garden, Calcutta, on Feb. 11.
    
In response to the Jan 23 invitation from WorldTel, the PTV turned 
down the offer on the stand that if the WorldTel would also share the 
expenses of the closing ceremony which WorldTel has refused.
    
However, the PTV will be showing the closing ceremony scheduled to 
held at Lahore on March 17.
    
Interestingly, the 90-minute opening ceremony, is not in the package 
of US $ 750,000 which the PTV has signed.
    
The PTV has already fulfilled its contractual obligation by giving US 
$ 750,000 in four instalments. 30% had to be paid upon execution of 
the contract while the next 30% was due to be paid by Sept. 30. The 
other 30% had to be paid by Nov. 15 and the final 10% by Jan 15.
    
Sources, requesting not be identified, stated that the PTV will show 
the matches round the clock. 
    
The sources stated that preference would be given to Pakistan matches 
by the PTV. For example, Pakistan and South Africa match on Feb. 29 
will be shown live by the PTV while the ball-to-ball recording of the 
other match on the same day (West Indies vs Kenya at Pune) will be 
shown later in the evening.<hr>
