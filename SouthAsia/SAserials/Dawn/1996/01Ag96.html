Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, July 31: Supreme Court Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah accused the 
government of dragging its feet on the question of regularisation of judges 
and suggested that a deadlock on the issue be avoided.
    
The federal government is dragging its feet on the question of 
regularisation of judges. Efforts in all sincerity should be made for such 
implementation (of Supreme Court decision in transfer and appointment of 
judges case) in entirety. Delay leads to deadlock which should be avoided, 
the CJ told a full court reference held on the eve of the retirement of 
Justice Chaudhry Fazal Karim.
    
He later told reporters that there were certain remedies available in law 
to check violations of the Constitution. He asserted that the Supreme Court 
decisions were binding and must be implemented.
    
Justice Sajjad Ali said the judiciary was committed to ensuring that the 
Constitution be obeyed and to upholding the rule of law. We judges have 
taken oath prescribed in the Constitution that we will discharge our duties 
and perform our functions honestly to the best of our ability and 
faithfully in accordance with the Constitution, he said, adding: We have 
also taken oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.
    
The CJ pointed out that Article 190 of the Constitution ordained that all 
executive and judicial authorities throughout Pakistan shall come in aid 
of the Supreme Court. Indisputably, this is the command of the 
Constitution, he said, adding that the implementation of the Supreme Court 
decisions had to be made by or through the government or executive 
authorities. He regretted that the government instead of fully implementing 
the court decision was trying to wriggle out of it.

<a name="eigh">Eight killed, 24 injured in Lahore gang feud</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, July 30: Gangland warfare involving a former city councillor and 
some mujawars of the Data Darbar shrine killed eight innocent people, 
including a child, and left 24 injured in the crowded Bilalganj locality of 
Lahore.
    
Those killed in the carnage were participating in Eid-i-Milad-un-Nabi 
festivities in the Malik Park area near the Data Darbar shrine, watching a 
motorcycle show or receiving offerings from the former city councillor, 
Tahir Nafees alias Prince, who barely escaped death in what was apparently 
an attack aimed at him. Most of the casualties were from among young 
people.
    
The killings took place when Tahir Prince, who was distributing niaz 
among the residents of the area, was fired upon by the attackers, said to 
be mujawars of the Data shrine. The attackers reportedly came on 
motorcycles and a car and opened indiscriminate firing with Kalashnikovs 
and other automatic weapons.
   
They were said to be avenging the death of one of their cousins killed in 
London in 1994 - a crime in which Tahir Prince was implicated and for 
which he underwent imprisonment in Britain. He had returned to Lahore about 
four months ago, and tension had been running high with the rival party, 
reportedly led by Mian Hamid Muajawar.

<a name="test">Test ban treaty : US, India hold private talks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, July 27: The United States displayed signs of visibly increased 
confidence to achieve its goal of getting the CTBT signed by September this 
year, indicating that private negotiations were going on with India to 
bring New Delhi on board.
    
We believe that we can achieve this, and we look very much to China and to 
India to help us achieve this, state department spokesman Nick Burns told 
the regular briefing while commenting on the joint statement issued after 
meetings between Secretary Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister 
Primakov.

Following his meeting with (Chinese foreign minister) Qian Qichen and his 
meeting with the Indian foreign minister, the United States intends to 
continue as a very high priority foreign policy matter our negotiations in 
Geneva that are multilateral, as you know, to complete the agreement for a 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and to have it signed this autumn in the 
United States.

Asked how the US would get around the Indian hurdle, Mr Burns said: Well 
continue our negotiations, continue our private discussions, and hope that 
India will agree that India should not stand in the way of an agreement 
that is so important to people all over the world.
    
Observers said the revitalised US hopes about CTBT could mean increased 
pressure on the other threshold nuclear powers, including Pakistan and 
Israel, if India were to somehow agree to either sign the CTBT or to soften 
its opposition.

A serious debate has already begun in Pakistan on Islamabads position on 
the CTBT if India signs it, as many political opponents of the government 
believe the Benazir Bhutto government was preparing to sign it even if 
India did not.

South Asian experts say Pakistan should take a position beyond the Indian 
position and it should declare its nuclear policy independent of New Delhi 
because the current policy has, in their words, placed all the Pakistani 
eggs in the Indian basket.
    
They say Pakistan should link the signing of the CTBT to an amicable 
solution of the Kashmir dispute, reduction of conventional military force 
by India and signing of a no-war pact with India, guaranteed by world 
powers.
    
Alternatively, Pakistan should seek a US nuclear umbrella and sign a 
security pact with Washington against any Indian aggression, including 
attacks on its borders by conventional or nuclear weapons, they say.
    
These experts warned against the possible chances of a bargain between 
United States and India, as indicated by the state department spokesman.
    
They said now that the US was openly talking of private discussions with 
the Indians, it was all but obvious that give- and-take sessions would be 
held and New Delhi would try to cash as much of its cheques, including the 
blank cheque handed to it by Islamabad in the shape of its India-first 
policy.

<a name="oppo">Opposition okays plan to oust government</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, July 26: A joint committee of the recently formed 15-party 
opposition alliance finalised a plan to oust the present government through 
agitation.
    
The committee has finalised its recommendations and these are being sent to 
the Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, Mian Nawaz Sharif, Raja 
Zafar-ul-Haq told Dawn.
    
Raja Zafar-ul-Haq, who is heading the committee comprising representatives 
from all the 15 parties, however, refused to disclose the details of the 
plan.
    
The plan would be considered at a meeting of the party heads likely to be 
held in the first week of August, he said.
    
The committee has recommended that mass mobilisation campaign should be 
launched forthwith for preparing a ground for a long march or a final 
attack on the government, Raja Zafar-ul-Haq said.

<a name="indi">India-Russia talk on new defence package</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

WASHINGTON, July 30: India and Russia are negotiating a new defence 
production package which includes future aircraft co-production and weapon 
technology transfer, according to officials in both countries, quoted here.
    
Indian and Russian defence officials now are exchanging views on proposed 
projects with the intent of approving a package in November. Proposals 
include potential licensing of Russian aircraft and ordnance technologies 
for Indian co-production.
    
Reports said the new agreement could involve technology transfer for air 
defence systems, ammunition, torpedoes, SU-30 aircraft, anti-missile 
systems and other support systems for air, land and sea-based weapon 
systems.
    
The new package is expected to cover a three-year period. It is to be 
finalised by November 15, and once approved, co-operative projects could 
begin next year, according to officials quoted here.

Co-production of weapons would fit with the philosophy of the new United 
Front government which wants to bolster Indias indigenous defence 
industry, experts said.
    
Self- reliance in weaponry and defence technology is one of our top 
priorities, said Indian Defence Minister Mulayam Singh Yadav in an 
interview last week.
    
The drive for independence has been led by Abul Kalam, Indian defence 
research and development secretary and director-general of state-owned 
Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
    
The Indian government now plans to produce 70 per cent of its weaponry by 
2006, as part of a 10-year self-reliance plan. Today the DRDO has achieved 
30 per cent self-reliance in defence systems and spares, according to DRDO 
officials.

<a name="usgo">US govt orders building of ultra supercomputer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, July 27: While working overtime to prohibit nuclear testing by 
non-nuclear states under the proposed CTBT, the United States has ordered 
building of an ultra supercomputer that would continue the testing of 
nuclear weapons under simulated conditions.
    
The contract for the computer was given to the international giant IBM by 
the federal government for $94 million, energy department officials 
announced.
    
The computer would allow the US technicians to update and maintain their 
nuclear stockpiles in battle-ready condition.
    
Many countries, including Pakistan and India, are insisting that all kinds 
of nuclear testing, including those on simulated computers, should be 
banned under the CTBT otherwise the less developed countries would be 
placed at a gross disadvantage.
    
The computer, to be called DOE Option Blue, eventually will operate at 
about 3 trillion operations per second and will have a memory of about 2.5 
trillion bytes. Current supercomputers have about 10 billion bytes.

WASHINGTON, July 25: Pakistan and US aviation officials will meet here on 
Aug 13 to 15 to increase commercial flights between the two countries.
    
PIA will be trying to fly into Houston, Chicago and Washington while US 
airlines will be given the stations they wanted.
    
Negotiations have been going on and meetings have now been fixed in 
August, M. Nawaz Tiwana, managing director of the PIA, told a news 
conference after speaking at a luncheon reception for prominent Pakistanis 
and guests in Washington.
    
We are very keen on extending our services to other cities in the US and 
the prospects look extremely bright, he said.
    
Mr Tiwana said US airlines would also be given landing rights in other 
Pakistani cities and PIA was not worried about the competition.

<a name="drug">Drug prices again raised by 38 per cent</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, July 27: The pharmaceutical companies have increased the prices of 
both controlled and decontrolled medicines ranging from 20 to 38 per cent. 
The new prices as notified by pharmaceutical concerns and made effective on 
July 18 and 24, include a 5 per cent General Sale Tax announced in the 
budget for 1996-97 by the government.
    
Those companies who have so far increased prices of their products include 
Wellcome, Abbott, Bosch, Glaxo, Opal and Sami.
    
This is the third increase this year. First increase was made effective in 
January, followed by another in May.
    
For the last many weeks, the supply of a number of both essential and non-
essential items remains disrupted, leading to black-marketing.
    
According to new lists issued by the multinational pharmaceuticals, the 
prices of the items of common use including controlled items such as 
Cefspan capsules and suspension (antibiotics) have also gone up.
 
Decontrolled items of common use include Polyfax skin ointment, Iberol-F, 
Kaltin-AP, Optilets-M tablets and Pedialyte suspension. Interestingly, the 
last item is an ORS given to children in loose motions, which has seen an 
increase of Rs 7.82.

<a name="howt">How to stop this mad rush</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From M. Ziauddin

THE continuous erosion in the value of the Pakistani rupee against US 
dollar has become self-perpetuating because of the relatively higher 
earning potential of dollar deposits in contrast to that of Pak deposits. 
Pak rupee bank deposits for one year normally carry a mark-up rate of 12.5 
per cent. 
  
However, after adjusting the earnings to 2.5 per cent of Zakat, 2 per cent 
of withholding tax and 10 per cent of inflation, the earnings become 
negative by at least 2 per cent.
    
On the other hand the dollar deposits for one year which normally carry a 
mark up of 6.8 per cent are exempted from Zakat and withholding tax 
deductions. And a potential to appreciate by at least 10 per cent per annum 
against the Pak rupee, in view of expanding current account deficit and 
galloping domestic rate of inflation, makes the dollar deposits more 
attractive, increasing the earning rate of these deposits to around 25 per 
cent. 
   
And even after adjusting against a 10 per cent rate of inflation in 
Pakistan where a major part of these deposits are in any case used, the 
earnings on the dollar deposits still remain well above 12 per cent.
    
This unremitting escalation in profits on dollar deposits vis-`-vis Pak 
rupee deposits, induces rupee depositors to convert their holdings into 
dollar deposits without as much as a second thought causing the value of 
the rupee to keep declining almost on daily basis.
    
So, as more and more rupees chase the dollars, the value of dollars against 
the rupee keeps on escalating rendering the hard currency ever more 
attractive for savers than the local currency.
    
The continued decline in the value of the rupee against dollar has made the 
local currency seemingly fully convertible without any official 
announcement to the effect and without the attendant gains like the 
importer not needing to go to the State Bank to buy his dollar requirements 
and the exporter not being required to surrender his dollars to the State 
Bank.
    
One way of making the dollar deposits less attractive vis-`-vis the rupee 
deposits is to levy zakat and withholding tax on the former. But that would 
only cause the dollar deposits to deplete without in any way improving the 
attractiveness of the rupee deposits.
    
Another way of tackling the problem is to bring the rupee deposit rates at 
par with rupee advances rates, that is 24 per cent. But this will still 
make the dollar deposits at least about 7 per cent more profitable than the 
rupee deposits. 
   
However, for the income tax payers, the profitability would go down to 
about 5 per cent because they can adjust the 2 per cent withholding tax 
against their final returns.
    
A five per cent spread between dollar deposit and rupee deposit would make 
the entire exercise of converting the rupee deposits into dollar deposits 
and back for use in Pakistan a cumbersome drill without much gain.
    
And in this situation, if an annual injection of $500 million of private 
foreign investment is made, the chase would go in the reverse direction 
with dollars chasing the rupees rather than rupees chasing dollars.
    
And in order to attract as much as 500 million dollars of foreign private 
investment annually , the government would need to take some urgent 
measures like reducing the banking service charges which have shot up to 7 
per cent behind which the bankers hide their inefficiency and corruption.
    
However, the best way to arrest the foreign exchange rot is to bring down 
the rate of domestic inflation well under 9 per cent in the next few 
months.
    
Yet another way of reducing the attractiveness of dollar deposits vis-`-vis 
rupee deposits is to bring the rates of rupee advances down at par with the 
rupee deposit rate of 12.5 per cent. 
   
This will cause a significant slow down in the rate of inflation because 
the cost of money, the most important input in any production, will come 
down steeply as a result.
    
The attempt to reduce the rate of inflation by curbing borrowing for 
budgetary purposes has failed miserably because nobody seems to believe in 
practising what he or she is preaching with regard to tight monetary 
control.
    
Waste and corruption have become institutionalised. Ask a bureaucrat about 
it and he will point his accusing finger at the politicians and the 
politician in turn would pass the buck back to the bureaucrat. 
   
Every one seems to think it his exclusive right to wallow in corruption 
while criticising others who indulge in the same pastime of destroying the 
country.
    
It is a vicious circle which probably only time can break. Meanwhile, the 
government would do well to adopt measures to trigger an accelerated 
investment activity in productive sectors so that more and more exportable 
surpluses are produced.
    
In this connection, it will have to make capital for investment by the 
private sector more economic while keeping a tight leash on borrowings by 
the public sector to finance non- productive expenditures. Besides, it 
should bring down the import tariff on raw materials and intermediaries by 
a significant degree in order to enable the investors to fabricate products 
for local consumption as well as for exports at costs within reach of most 
of domestic consumers while making them highly competitive price-wise in 
the international markets.
    
Lower rate of inflation accompanied by lower rates of rupee advances would 
make the rupee deposits as attractive as dollar deposits rendering the 
exercise of converting rupees into dollars on daily basis not as profitable 
as it is today.
    
It will also help if in order to retire budgetary debt, dollars are not 
imported at costly rates. When these dollars are converted into rupees for 
short-term retirement of budgetary debt, the rupee does not gain much , but 
when these rupees are converted back into dollars for re-exporting, the 
rupee sheds at least a couple of paisa against the dollar causing further 
erosion in the value of the rupee.

<a name="opit">Options for textile industry: modernise or perish</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sultan Ahmed

PAKISTANS textile industry, which has been passing through a sustained 
multiple crisis, may fare far worse because of its failure to modernise 
adequately and the stiffer challenges it will face from its fast 
modernising competitors.
    
Not only are its traditional competitors like India and China modernising 
their manufacturing process but also rather new entrants in the field like 
Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. They have imported the latest textile 
machinery from Germany, a major textile machinery exporter, in very large 
measure.
    
The crisis is not the textile industrys alone but that of the national 
economy as a whole after the country incurred almost a record foreign trade 
deficit of $ 3 billion last year. Its exports fell to $ 8.6 billion against 
the modest target of 9.2 billion dollars for the year. And 60 per cent of 
Pakistans exports are cotton or cotton based products.
    
The crisis in the textile industry has such an awfully depressing impact on 
the Karachi Stock Exchange that while 59 per cent of the 785 companies 
listed on it are quoted below the face value of their shares, 73 per cent 
of the 243 textile companies quoted on its are below their face value and 
82 per cent of the spinning mills are below their face value, highlighting 
the absolute shambles in which the premier industry of Pakistan is now or 
has been for a long time.
    
The reasons for this enduring crisis are obvious. Textile mills accustomed 
to getting cotton at subsidised rates are not able to get it cheap any 
more. After the cotton output touched a peak of 12.9 million bales in 1991-
92 there was a large fall in production during the next three years which 
kicked up prices and necessitated marginal imports as well.
    
Finally when production rose to 10.5 million bales or more, last year the 
mills were forced to pay world prices for their cotton or import it at 
higher prices.
    
The textile mill owners have also been under pressure from the nationalised 
banks and DFIs to repay their long defaulted loans which many have not been 
able to do as they partially misused them or had obtained large kickbacks 
for themselves from machinery exporters and others at the time of setting 
up of the mills. So many of these mills were born sick, and have become 
even more so over the years with the banks losing more than their owners.
    
Many of them have not been able to get new bank loans, unless they had 
political clout and meanwhile the interest rates have shot up to 22 to 25 
per cent. The government wants to help the industry. In fact each 
administration has come up with a comprehensive textile package, and at 
times more than one, as the present government has done. But the malady of 
the industry appears to have reached cancerous proportions.
    
If adequate remedies are not found, enforced and sustained the loss will be 
more of the countrys than of the industrys, and we may export more and 
more of raw cotton as we did in the 1950s before the textile industry began 
coming up in a big way.
    
Surely, even otherwise we cannot boost our exports significantly and our 
performance will be far below the modest targets set each year hopefully, 
if we continue to export more of cheap grey cloth, towels, bed sheets and 
tenting materials, apart from the low priced cotton yarn which in many 
cases earns less foreign exchange than the total spent on its production 
and the foreign exchange the raw cotton utilised for making the yarn would 
have earned if exported straight.
    
During the visit of a group of Asian economic writers to Germany the German 
Machinery and Plant Manufacturers Association with its headquarters in 
Frankfurt released German machinery export figures for Asian countries. 
They show that out of the textile machinery worth 2.6 billion Deutsche mark 
it exported to Asia in 1995, Pakistan bought the machinery for just 72.5 
million Deutsche mark, and India 548 million DM, which meant an increase of 
58.7 per cent over its 1994 imports, while Pakistans import of the textile 
machinery from Germany fell by 26.4 per cent over its 1994 imports. And 
that happened despite the fact that India has its own textile machinery 
manufacturing industry and the All-Pakistan Textile Mills Association has 
been pleading with the government to allow textile machinery imports from 
India.
    
Thailand imported textile machinery for 137 million DM from Germany in 1995 
 an improvement of 28 per cent over its 1994 performance, Indonesia 240 
million DM which is an improvement of 54 per cent over its 1994 imports and 
South Korea 296.4 million DM worth of textile machinery, which marked a 
fall of 11.3 per cent over its 1994 imports.
    
Japan, which manufactures advanced textile machinery and exports a part of 
it, imported from Germany textile machinery worth 142.3 million DM, a fall 
of 8.7 per cent over its 1994 imports. While Japan and South Korea are 
reducing the size of their textile sector as they had earlier over-
expanded, labour costs there had risen high, and their products are getting 
less competitive in world markets.
    
Pakistan is the only major textile producing country which reduced its 
import of textile machinery from Germany in 1995. And that has happened at 
a time when there is a great deal of talk in Pakistan about the urgency for 
our textile industry to modernise itself and opt for the higher value added 
from the low or almost non-value added production.

Not cheap any more
 
It is easy to lash out at the cotton-based industries, as Qazi Aleemullah, 
Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission, did last week and assert they 
could no longer sustain the national economy.
    
The textile industry, he said, got rewarded for its inefficiency through 
cheap cotton, cheap credit and low-wage labour. The fact is that none of 
the three cheap inputs is available cheap now. If more textile mills close 
down, the loss may not really be of their owners, who have had their ample 
rewards for long for small or negative investments. It will be of the banks 
and DFIs which lent large sums to them, of the workers and of the country 
which has wasted or allowed to waste precious resources cussedly for too 
long.
    
The fact is that if the textile industry is not modernised quick and 
enabled to withstand competition not only from countries like India and 
China but also Thailand, Indonesia etc. which do not grow any cotton and 
import it from China or other countries, the result can be disastrous for 
us.
    
Until recently it was non-cotton-growing countries like Japan, Hong Kong, 
and South Korea which manufactured and exported cotton textile but now 
while they reduce their output, non-cotton growing countries like 
Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Bangladesh have joined their ranks and are 
reducing our options.
    
Now what is Pakistan going to do when it does not modernise its textile 
industry adequately and quickly, and all others are doing that? Commerce 
Minister Chaudhri Mukhtar says Pakistan imported machinery for $ 2.5 
billion in 1995-96 and out of that $ 600 million were for power plants.
    
If the power plants were excluded, Pakistans total import of non-
electrical machinery last year was below the 1994-95 figure of $ 2 billion 
import of machinery in 1994-95. And if out of that large figure, import of 
textile machinery from Germany in 1995 was for barely $ 48 million, which 
marks a fall of 26.4 per cent over the 1994 imports, modernisation of our 
textile industry is too slow and too inadequate while our competitors are 
moving fast and in full measure in this area.

Ailing industry
    
Pakistans ailing textile industry needs far more attention that it has 
been getting. 
   
The future should not be allowed to become a hostage of the past, and good 
investors should not be punished for the follies of the black sheep in the 
industry and absurd or unrealistic official policies. 
   
We have to make the best use of our cotton, manpower and the know-how to 
have a larger share of the worlds trade than a mere 0.2 per cent. 
   
The demand for creation of a separate ministry or division for textile with 
a minister should be given serious consideration. That is far more 
important than having a minister for trade fairs.

<a name="isim">Is IMF interference desirable?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Aslam

HOW much is the IMF-isation of the economy desirable? This is a big post-
budget issue being debated in the top business circles. Opinions vary, but 
most agree that it is bad for the country and needs to be checked at the 
highest level.
    
But how? This is a million-dollar question for the economic managers of the 
country. Some of them might have ready answers to apply a temporary brake 
to the developing economic crisis. But their options are limited. Some 
maintain the economy has been mortgaged in return for the aid package. Some 
even allege that the current role of the IMF may eventually lead to 
political decision making and the consequent loss of sovereignty.
    
Nobody could probably deny the fact that the economy is in a bad shape. 
Exports are not picking up to the desired level despite massive devaluation 
of the rupee. Imports are becoming more expensive widening the trade 
deficit to well over $ 3 billion last year. Foreign exchange reserves are 
almost static at around $ 1.2 billion. The inflation stands in double 
digits.
    
The slogan trade, not aid sees to have lost its relevance as the 
government is already growing under the weight of mounting foreign debt of 
$ 1.85 billion and the annual interest of $ 500 million on it. The country 
could hardly rely on its unexploited economic strength to meet this 
situation. It will have to look for new foreign aid in addition to the 
legendary donors. The successive governments were unable to fulfil the 
donors obligation.
    
That is where the role of the IMF begins.
    
Pity a the nation whom others tell what self-reliance means and how it 
could be achieved, said a leading spinner who owns half a dozen leading 
textile mills. Apart from strict control over government spendings, there 
could be many other options including judicious recovery of stuck-up loans 
of Rs 105bn. This could lead to self-reliance.
 
Top trade and industry circles claim that some donor countries are making 
conscious efforts to further cut the production base of the country and 
make it an exporter of some primary goods. If his happens, it would turn 
Pakistan into a dumping ground of export surplus of the developed 
countries.
    
A look at the last decades industrial inventory shows that no big unit 
based on the local raw materials was set up. But there are many multi-
billion plants including thermal power, synthetics, PTA and some others 
basically based on imported raw materials, local corporate giants say. 

Strong textile base
    
Pakistan has a strong textile production base (500 units) and is a leading 
supplier of cotton years to the world. All spinners are not angels. They 
have their failings. But in any case every year they earn foreign exchange 
worth $ 5 to 6 billion for the country or about 70 per cent of the total 
exports after adding value to the locally produced cotton, the mainstay of 
the economy. How the formidable textile sector is under foreign attack, a 
leading economist is of the view.
    
The textile industry is being squeezed to put it on the sick list as a 
sequel to free trade in cotton without determining the size of the home 
consumption. As a result, out of a bumper cotton crop of 10 million bales, 
2.3 million bales were sold to foreign buyers.
    
The IMF officials say that the budget deficit figures are doctored as it 
was 6.5 or 7 per cent and not 4.5 or 5 per cent of the GDP as showed in the 
1996-97 budget. The prime minister also says that the Central Board of 
Revenue has doctored the budget figures.
    
Our rulers ask top business to talk to the IMF if they want reduction in 
taxes said a leading industrialist adding but why we should talks to them? 
We have decided to fight out the threat to the economic sovereignty alone.

<a name="prop">Proposal to sell 5% IMFs gold for debt relief</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, July 30: Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund 
will consider in its meeting next September the proposal to sell up to 5 
per cent of the Funds gold, or 5 million ounces, to finance its part in 
the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and in a new initiative 
to provide debt relief to the worlds poorest countries.
    
The current ESAF resources, says the latest issue of IMF bulletin Survey, 
are expected to last until about 1999. We are then faced with an interim 
period  between 2000 and 2004  for which the Fund does not now have 
resources to support on-going ESAF operations or to finance the latest 
initiative in collaboration with the World Bank.
    
The sale of gold has been proposed by the IMF Managing Director, Michel 
Camdessus, to subsidise resources in view of the budget constraints faced 
by the bilateral donors. 
   
As, however, reservations have been expressed about using the IMFs capital 
base, the modified proposal provides that in selling gold, the profits from 
the gold sales would not be used; rather, the profits would be held and 
invested, and only the interest income would be used to help finance the 
needed subsidy.
    
ESAF, according to the report, will form the economic policy basis for the 
IMFs operations in the proposed initiative which is likely to benefit 20 
out of the 41 heavily indebted countries. However, ESAF in this operation 
would carry greater degree of concessionality than what is provided in 
other operations at present, it is asserted.
    
These countries, explains the report, were in a situation where, even with 
strong adjustment and reform programmes and the benefit of current debt-
relief mechanisms, their potential to service their external debt on an on-
going basis appeared limited.
    
The eligibility of countries for benefiting from this initiative would be, 
among others, a debt-service ratio (debt-service payments as a percent of 
export earnings) in the range of 20-25 per cent, and a present value of 
claims not exceeding 200-250 per cent of export earnings.
    
Among the 41 countries, most of them in Africa, 8 have been categorised as 
unsustainable, and another 12 as possibly stressed. The remaining 
countries now appear to be in sustainable external debt positions, 
meaning that current mechanisms would be sufficient. Even among the 
approximately 20 countries that may be selected to benefit from the 
initiative, their eligibility would be assessed case by case.
    
All the creditors  bilateral as well as multilateral  are expected to 
take part in the initiative which may even include write-off of some or all 
of their claims in respect of a selected country. From the Paris Club and 
other bilateral creditors, the initiative calls for stock-of-debt relief at 
the end of a prescribed adjustment period of up to 90%, instead of the 67% 
stock-of-debt reduction granted to date. 
   
The World Bank, according to the report, is considering providing 
additional assistance during the second three-year phase of adjustment, in 
the form of supplemental IDA allocations through grants. Similar mechanisms 
would be considered also in IMF. A country that pursues this second phase 
of adjustment, supported by a second three-year ESAF arrangement a Bank 
programme, will be promised relief from both bilateral creditors and from 
multilateral institutions in an amount sufficient at the end of that 
process to assure debt sustainability.
    
This will involve a stock operation from Paris Club and non-Paris Club 
bilateral creditors. If commercial banks are involved, they would be 
expected to provide at least comparable relief as well. Multilateral 
institutions will commit to providing the additional assistance necessary 
to bring the total debt stock of eligible countries in net present value 
terms, down to the threshold level, that is 200-250% debt to exports, and a 
debt-service ratio no higher than 20-25%.
    
The IMF would use either grants or highly concessional loan operations to 
bring about the desired reduction of the net present  value of its claims, 
while the Bank  and  other multilateral  institutions  would  use 
 resources  from a multilateral debt-reduction fund which would be funded 
from the Banks net income, from bilateral contributions, and possibly from 
other multilateral institutions. Bank management has already recommended 
that its Executive Board set aside $500 million this year for a special 
trust fund to be used as the Banks initial contribution. Helping  them 
reduce their external debt burden  to  a sustainable level should help 
increase investor confidence and remove one impediment to growth. But these 
countries, stressed Jack Boorman, Director of the IMFs Policy Development 
and Review Department, in an interview with the Survey, also need to 
develop institutions of effective economic policymaking and address 
infrastructure development problems, as well as problems of governance.

<a name="govt">Govt plans to establish national grid company</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, July 31: The government will set up a national grid company to 
purchase electricity from private power generation plants and supply it to 
different distribution networks which are being privatised, Chairman, 
Privatisation Commission, Syed Naveed Qamar said on Wednesday.
    
Area Electricity Boards (AEBs) are being converted into corporate entities 
and are being actively prepared for privatisation, he told a press 
conference. In view of large scale operational problems in some of the 
AEBs, the government has decided to hand over management control to 
international companies, he said.
    
The management control will be awarded to the reputed companies for a 
stipulated period of two years through a competitive process, he added.
    
Mr Qamar did not deny reports that AEBs of Lahore and Gujranwala had 
already been handed over surreptitiously to an American company without 
following any competitive process.

<a name="ksei">KSE index breaks 1,500-point barrier</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 25; The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices broke 
the barrier of 1,500 points on Thursday, signalling the extension of bear-
run in the coming sessions.
    
The index was last quoted at 1,489.42 as compared to 1,524.90 a day 
earlier, showing a loss of 35.48 points over the previous close and also 
the weakness of the base shares.
    
A 35-point decline in the index means wiping out of the market 
capitalisation about Rs 7 bn and it is a big single session loss.
    
The index has, over the week, lost about Rs 20 bn, pushing the total market 
capitalisation to Rs 333 bn from Rs 353bn, telling how the values are being 
eroded in each session.
    
The market capitalisation was almost stable around Rs 385bn for the last 
about three months after the protracted bear-run overtook the market amid 
either-way movement but seldom breach the barrier of Rs 370bn.
    
But heavy liquidation in the index shares over the last about four weeks 
has pushed to new low levels and there are fears that it might breach the 
Rs 300bn barrier during the next month, dealers said.
    
Analysts said the disturbing factor is that buying support is not coming at 
the falling prices as investors are progressively shifting investment to 
dollar and some other dollar-related modes of business.
    
But this is very serious development as it points to the exit of foreign 
buyers from the market and needs to be checked, they added.
    
The market decline was, therefore, again led by the multinationals under 
the lead of high-profile issues such as Lever Brothers, Brooke Bond, 
Hoechst Pakistan, Glaxo Lab, Colgate Pakistan, Singer Pakistan, Shell 
Pakistan and Siemens Pakistan, which suffered fresh fall ranging from Rs 2 
to 5.
    
Both the market leaders, Hub-Power and PTC vouchers also received heavy 
battering and fell well over Rs 1.50 instead of mostly fractional changes 
over the last about one year.
    
It also reflected foreign unloading in them and evoked sympathetic selling 
on some other counters.
    
PSO also maintained its downward trend and lost another Rs 4 followed by 
United Sugar, which fell Rs 4.80. Other notable losers were led by ICP 
SEMF, Citicorp, Adamjee Insurance, Gadoon Textiles, Dewan Salman, Gatron 
Industries and KESC, falling one rupee to Rs 2.75.
    
Some of the shares managed to recover modestly, major gainers among them 
Telecard, Gillette Pakistan, Bawany Sugar and Bawany Air Products, EFU 
General Insurance, and Shafiq Textiles, rising by one rupee to Rs 10.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, off Rs 1.45 on 13.433m 
shares, followed by Hub-Power, easy Rs 1.75 on 10m, Southern Electric, 
lower 70 paisa on 0.597m, Dhan Fibre, easy 10 paisa on 0.491m and Dewan 
Salman, off one rupee on 0.440m shares.
    
Other actives were led by FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, off 45 paisa on 0406m, 
Fauji Fertiliser, lower Rs 1.25 on 0.416m, ICI Pakistan, off 40 paisa on 
0.413m, LTV Modaraba, lower five paisa on 0.210m and MCB, off 75 paisa on 
0.151m shares.
    
Trading volume swelled to 30.351m shares from the previous about 19 m 
shares owing to brisk selling in PTC and Hub-Power.
    
There were 332 actives, out of which 199 fell, while 47 rose, with 86 
holding on to the last levels.

<a name="stoc">Stocks remain in bearish frame of mind</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 31: Stocks remained in a bearish frame of mind on Wednesday 
as investors were not inclined to make fresh commitments in the absence of 
fresh positive news from the corporate front.
    
The opening was distinctly easy after the news of Lahore killing reached 
the rings but the midsession saw revival of demand on some of the pivotals 
and the consequent decline in selling.
    
The KSE 100-share index ended with an extended decline of 26.17 points at 
1,455.77 as compared to 1,481.94 a day earlier, sending signals that it 
could break the barrier of 1,400 possibly by the next week.
    
The current favourites, notably Hub-Power and PTC vouchers after early 
decline did attract massive covering purchase after midsession limiting the 
index fall to 26 points.
    
A 26-point fall in the index means a loss of Rs 4 billion in the market 
capitalisation, which has dropped by well over Rs 16 bn during the last 
four sessions, dealers said.

An idea of investor willingness to hold on to their long positions may well 
be had from the trading pattern of PTC vouchers, which was massively traded 
amid alternate bouts of buying and selling.
    
Although it managed to finish the session with a fractional rise of only 
five paisa after falling earlier on heavy selling, and also managed to 
limit further loss in the index owing to its heavy weightage in the 100-
share index.
    
Similarly, another leading current favourite, Hub-Power also came in for 
strong support from the institutional traders in a bid to put the market 
back on the rails but the attempt proved abortive.
    
Heavy selling in Dewan Salman on news of a substantial loss for the last 
financial year blunted the sharp end if the market has one as it was marked 
down by Rs 4.70 on a business of about 3 million shares.
    
All other polyester shares followed it and fell under the lead of Dhan 
Fibre, Ibrahim Fibre, and Indus Polyester amid active selling.
    
Minus signs, therefore, again dominated the list, with some of the pivotals 
being in the forefront under the lead of PSO and Dewan Textiles, another 
share of the Dewan group of companies, which fell by Rs 41 for no apparent 
reason or heavy selling.
    
PSO, however, suffered a biggest decline for the single session as it fell 
by Rs 17 to close at the lowest bid of the day at Rs 358 on a business of 
28,000 shares.
    
Over the last one month or so it has progressively declined from its recent 
peak level of Rs 404, reflecting the general market conditions and 
investors distaste for shares.
    
The other big loser was Siemens Pakistan, which fell by Rs 25.50 on 
business of 600 shares. There was no negative news to which the sharp 
reversal could be attributed.
    
Other big losers were led by Askari Leasing, ICP SEMF, Din Textiles, KESC 
and some others, falling by Rs 1.25 to 2.75.
    
Other big losers were led by Wellcome Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser, Engro 
Chemicals, Glaxo Lab and some others but Dawood Hercules rose after being 
ex-dividend at Rs 129 and finished at Rs 136.
    
The board of directors of Paramount Leasing has announced a maidend 
dividend at the rate of 10 per cent for the year ended Dec 31,1995 but the 
news at a time when the market was in deeper recession and failed to evoke 
sympathetic buying in the leasing sector.
    
Gainers were few, reflecting the general apathy. However, United 
Distributors maintained its upward drive on news of higher earning and 
ended with a fresh gain of Rs 2.50 and so did Kohat Cement and some others.
    
PTC Vouchers topped the list of most active, up five paisa on 20m shares 
followed by Hub_Power, steady 25 paisa 8.161m, Dewan Salman, off Rs 4.70 on 
2.933m, ICI Pakistan, easy 15 paisa on 0.554m, Ibrahim Fibre, lower 50 
paisa on 0.282m, KASB & Co, up 15 paisa on 0.227m and LTV Modaraba, 
unchanged on 0.201m shares. There were some other active too. Trading 
volume soared to 35.329m shares from the previous 16.483 m shares thanks to 
heavy activity in PTC.
    
There were 319 active, out of which 176 shares fell, while 53 rose, with 90 
holding on to the last levels.

<a name="thep">The President Marshal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

I WRITE about a very large piece of precious real estate, a large naturally 
rich country of 44 million very poor people, whose leaders, their spouses, 
and close cronies are very rich indeed.
    
Zaire covering 2,345,410 square kilometres (as compared to Pakistans 
796,095 sq km) was once known simply as the Congo until in 1885 it became 
the personal property of King Leopold II of Belgium when its name and style 
was changed to the Independent State of the Congo. In 1908 it became a 
Belgian colony which it remained until it was granted independence in 1960. 
In 1971, as the personal property of President Marshal Mobutu Sese Seko 
Kuku Ngbendu wa Za Banga (the all- powerful warrior who, by his endurance 
and will to win, goes from contest to contest, leaving fire in his wake) 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo became the Republic of Zaire (meaning 
river).
    
Joseph-Desire (as he was originally named) Mobutu was born in 1930. He 
started life as a clerk in the finance department of the Belgian Congolese 
army and contributed articles to the Leopoldville Press. After his 
discharge in 1956, he became a reporter for the daily, LAvenir, and then 
the editor of the weekly, LActualities Africaines. He joined Lumumbas 
political party soon after its founding in 1958. The day the Congo gained 
its independence in 1960, the coalition government of Kasavabu and Lumumba 
appointed Mobutu chief of staff of the Force Publique (the army) and eight 
days later that force mutinied, which led to the secession of Katanga and 
the power struggle between Kasavubu and Lumumba. Lumumba was murdered, 
Kasavubu took over and in 1961 appointed Mobutu commander-in-chief of the 
armed forces. In 1965, Mobutu got rid of Kasavubu and took over the 
presidency.
    
Thirty-one years later, the former sergeant now self-styled Marshal remains 
President. He has worked hard at draining his country and amassing his 
personal fortune, now estimated to be in the region of $ 5 billion. As a 
rule, less than a third of the value of the countrys goods and chattels 
and exports, and whatever else, is returned to the treasury  the exporters 
and the intermediaries are worthy winners of their Pride of Performance 
awards.
    
The Presidents authority mainly rests on his control of key security 
forces, which totally ignore his government. The Civil Guard and the 15,000 
strong Special Presidential Division (DSP) forces are exclusively under the 
tutelage of Mobutu loyalist generals. Both divisions are better disciplined 
and are paid with more frequency than the regular armed forces and the 
gendarmerie. The Civil Guard, a police force trained to use police measures 
as well as to combat terrorism, to prevent fraud in customs collections, 
and to maintain order, is independent in structure. Members of all the 
security forces prey on civilians without official rebuke. Undisciplined 
soldiers commit numerous human rights abuses and criminal infractions, 
including robbery, extortion and looting, on a daily basis.
    
The modern sector of the economy collapsed in 1991, and many parts of the 
country have returned to barter systems in lieu of monetary exchanges. 
Civil servants and military have gone without pay for periods of many 
months. Subsistence agriculture is the mainstay of the economy and permits 
the country and the poor downtrodden people to just survive the lengthy 
crisis. Industry remains largely crippled. Lack of new investment, poor 
roads, infrastructure and corruption  which affects all segments of the 
economy  have contributed to the decline, especially in the profitable 
mining and minerals sector. Easily smugglable diamonds and offshore oil 
revenues constitute the countrys major source of foreign currency.
    
Mobutism is the national philosophy of Zaire. His name is sung in popular 
songs, his sayings are recited. But the 44 million people have no great 
fondness for him; they are merely doing what they are told and paying 
homage to their chief. On the day the country is rid of him, they will 
curse his name, burn his pictures, and pay allegiance to a new chief.
    
Mobutus excesses are extravagant. His overseas bank accounts are stuffed 
with pilfered funds and his loyalty and concern is distinctly self-centred 
and has nothing to do with national advancement. When he came to power, 
Zaire was a country on the move and Mobutus response was to set out on a 
spending orgy that made economists heads whirl, and to single-mindedly 
pursue personal prestige and national grandeur.
    
On the human rights side, his record of excesses are also extravagant. 
There is no respect for the integrity of the person, political and other 
extrajudicial killings are rife, people frequently simply disappear; 
torture and degrading treatment in custody are the order of the day. 
Arrests and detention are arbitrary, and fair and public trials are denied. 
Journalists and other media officials are intimidated, harassed, and 
detained at the whim of the authorities.
    
Through it all, Marshal Mobutu insists (convincing those who allow 
themselves to be convinced) that Zaire and its people are doing fine and 
that the problems Western journalists write about are all illusory, merely 
exhibiting their medias bias against Black Africa.
    
The hospitals cannot treat the sick for want of medicine, the schools 
cannot teach the children for want of books. The evil Marshal, who leaves 
fire in his wake, achieves it all with the greatest of ease, having 
perfected the art of bribery and the splintering of the opposition, and 
having over the years completely demoralised, subdued and politicised what 
counted for the semblance of his countrys judiciary.
    
The United States, as it must do in its own supreme interests (Tis our 
true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the 
foreign world  GW, farewell address, 1796), continues its diplomatic dance 
with Zaire. In the 1970s there were debates in the US Congress about 
Washingtons cosy alliance with Mobutu, but the official line was that 
Zaire was economically and strategically important, that it was a counter- 
balance to growing Soviet influence in Central Africa (as in the 1980s 
Pakistan was considered to be against growing Muslim fundamentalism), and 
that Mobutu, a staunch anti-Communist (as is Benazir considered to be a 
staunch secularist) should be supported regardless of all shortcomings. 
Consequently, Zaire in the late 70s received nearly half of all aid money 
the Carter administration allocated for Black Africa. Was Washington 
helping a country develop, or was it merely buying the loyalty of an 
autocrat?
    
The tempo has since changed. Washington deliberately kept the post of 
ambassador to Zaire unfilled for a two-year stretch and since 1992, except 
for humanitarian aid to private organisations, no US assistance has been 
given. However, the recent appointment of an ambassador and the double-
speak uttered by a State Department spokesman clarifies current US policy: 
Mobutu is the chief obstacle to democracy in Zaire, as such he has the key 
role to play. We are encouraging him and all the key members there to adopt 
the reforms necessary for democracy. To which, Zairian Professor Georges 
Nzongola-Ntalaga, from the safety of Howard University, sharply reacted: 
It does not make any sense to see Mobutu both as an obstacle and a force 
of democracy. There can be no move towards democracy with Mobutu in the 
way.
    
Inflation soars by the day. It ran at the figure of 370% during 1995 and is 
estimated to exceed this figure in 1996. In 1993, a new currency was 
introduced. The new Zaire was created which was equal to 3,000,000 old 
Zaires and a dollar could be bought for 1,194 Zaires. By December 1994, 
the dollar cost 3,275 Zaires, in August 1995 it could be bought for 16,700 
Zaires, and in May of 1996, one dollar cost 35,000 Zaires. But then, such 
has to be the state of affairs when uneducated selfish leaders rob with a 
will and there is no counter-force to check their greed. When nasty old 
military dictator Zia fell from the sky in 1988, making way for democracy, 
we could buy a dollar for around Rs 20. Now, thanks to the virtues of our 
freely and fairly elected democratic leaders, it costs us double that 
amount.
    
Relatively speaking, as colonialists go, the British were fair and square. 
They left us with values which we have since lost. Led as we are now, and 
surrounded by well meaning friends as we seem to be, what is there to 
prevent us from going down the river, the Zairian way? Is the President 
Marshal able to further tutor our leaders in the ways of safe investment? 
And what can we, the faint-hearted 130 million, say to the famished 44 
million that will encourage them to stand up for their rights?

<a name="livi">Living in limbo</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mazdak

WHEN did you last hear of a Pakistani scientist or engineer conceive, 
invent or design something new, something that extends the horizons of 
human knowledge?
    
Apart from the officially neglected Dr Abdus Salam  the only Nobel 
laureate for any of the sciences in the Muslim world, Professor Salimuzaman 
Siddiqui, Dr Parvez Hoodhboy and Dr Ata-ur- Rehman, I cannot think of a 
single innovative and original Pakistani scientist. In fact, we can draw 
depressing parallels with the rest of the Islamic world where the same 
intellectual inertia exists. How many patents have been issued to Muslim 
inventors? How many scientific or mathematical theories have been 
propounded by Muslim scientists? Even our so-called nuclear research at 
Kahuta is derivative and imitative.
    
Take even the most mundane research that has immense and immediate 
relevance to much of the Islamic world, and we find that it is taking place 
in the West. For example, research into alternative sources of energy like 
solar power and wind energy could greatly benefit us, and yet what have our 
scientists and engineers achieved in this field? Or take desalination of 
sea water, or even agriculture in saline or semi-desert areas. We have made 
absolutely no progress, waiting instead for European (or Israeli) 
scientists to give us solutions on a platter.
    
Last year, the World Bank suggested a number of economy measures to the 
government. One of these proposals was to shut down the Pakistan Council 
for Scientific and Industrial Research. When made public, this idea was 
greeted in the Press with shock and horror. In fact, it was viewed as a 
Western plot to sabotage research in Pakistan. And yet, if objectively 
analysed, the output of the PCSIR over the years does not exactly inspire 
confidence in the work being done in its laboratories. To a great extent, 
this is not the fault of the Council staff: starved of funds, the budget 
barely allows for salaries and utilities.
    
But the problem Pakistan and the entire Muslim world faces goes far deeper 
than the mere shortage of funds: in many countries not afflicted with our 
atrophy of the creative faculties, most genuine scientists would take their 
training and talents to institutions where they are put to good use. Here, 
they stay on for the sake of security as well as the fact that they have 
few options. Ultimately, they become time-serving careerists who have more 
in common with bureaucrats than with scientists.
    
The last decade has witnessed a remarkable growth in computer and 
communication technology. How many Muslims have been at the cutting edge of 
this change? True, one or two Pakistanis have done well abroad in marketing 
computers and related products, but to the best of my knowledge, nobody 
from this part of the world has made any significant contribution to the 
rapid transformation which is changing the way we think and live and work. 
Once again, the world is sprinting ahead, leaving the Muslim world far 
behind. For centuries now, we have been reduced to the role of users of 
technology developed elsewhere: nobody, including ourselves, expects us to 
be inventors and innovators.
    
Clearly, the problem transcends the shortage of resources: several Muslim 
countries are raking in  and squandering  billions of petrodollars, and 
they could easily afford the costliest research equipment. But scientific 
breakthroughs first take place in the mind, and it is here that we lag 
behind. What we have lost somewhere along the way centuries ago is the 
sense of wonder, the burning curiosity that lie at the heart of scientific 
inquiry. This quest for pure knowledge for its own sake is driven by a 
refusal to take anything for granted, and to question the most fundamental 
assumptions.
    
By separating the state from religion, secular societies have permitted and 
encouraged citizens to question, criticise and attack the state and the 
social order without in any way involving the belief system. Extended to 
the scientific establishment, this translates into young researchers 
bending their efforts towards constantly picking holes in officially 
endorsed theories without losing their jobs. At a lower level, students 
questioning their teachers on everything under the sun without being 
threatened with expulsion. To field these queries, professors have to be 
well prepared. This constant ferment leads to a dialectic that results in a 
restless drive towards exploring the frontiers of knowledge. It can be  
and has been  argued that change for its own sake is detrimental to social 
stability; indeed, many Eastern societies have stagnated for centuries 
because of this very assumption.
    
Here at home, we are caught in the dichotomy of wishing to make material 
progress while at the same time preserving intact our exploitative social 
order and decaying traditions. Unable to resolve this fundamental 
contradiction, we are trying to prevent the winds of change from blowing 
away the cobwebs in our minds while simultaneously paying lip-service to 
the need for scientific advancement. This is in no way meant to suggest 
that in order to make progress, we must give up our culture. However, we 
will have to discard the irrational and unscientific attitudes that 
currently dominate the national psyche. The highly successful and 
competitive Pacific Rim nations have transformed themselves within a 
generation by ensuring education and health care for all their citizens, 
and by limiting their population growth to a reasonable and sustainable 
rate. At the same time, they are investing heavily in research and 
development. We are doing neither, and yet our fatuous leaders never tire 
of announcing that we are going to join the ranks of the Asian Tigers any 
moment now.
    
Basically, the rational approach consists in analysing issues objectively 
and solving them using the tools of logic we have developed and 
internalised. We in much of the Islamic world find this an uncomfortable 
attitude towards life as it demands constantly questioning the status quo. 
We would rather live in the past, dreaming dreams of past glory. Our 
religious luminaries have a vested interest in keeping the masses as 
backward as possible so that they can retain their grip on their benighted 
intellects. Feudals want to keep progress at bay so that they can maintain 
their lock on power. The monarchs and dictators who rule most of the 
Islamic world certainly do not want aware and educated citizens to question 
their right to govern. With all these interlocking interests striving to 
keep their people in the dark, it is little wonder that scientific progress 
is virtually non-existent.
    
Away from complex and expensive laboratories, the scientific approach I am 
talking about also includes the schoolboy opening up his alarm clock to see 
how it works; the eccentric inventor tinkering in his garage, devoting 
years of his life and all his savings in developing a gadget which may have 
no practical use; the amateur astronomer examining the stars from his 
backyard through his small telescope, dreaming of discovering a heavenly 
body which will be named after him. How many of us engage in these time-
consuming tasks just to satisfy our own curiosity?
    
Until we in the Muslim world regain our sense of wonder and stop taking 
things for granted, we are condemned to remain in limbo, inhabiting the 
backwaters of human progress.

<a name="them">The Marcos syndrome</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

WHAT is the source of the anguish eating into the hearts of Pakistans 
thinking men and women? The short answer to this is that they are worried 
not so much by the skyrocketing prices of daily necessities or even by Mr 
Jafareys budget as they are by the absence of any direction in the 
nations affairs.
    
Where are we headed? What kind of a Republic are we trying to build? What 
are our national priorities? To these questions there are simply no answers 
because what is being seen on the national stage is a series of plundering 
expeditions carried out in the name of democracy and power. Forget about 
the clichi that this is not what the country was created for. In no country 
of the world, not even in a Haiti ruled by the likes of a Duvalier, will it 
ever be publicly acknowledged that the purpose of government is the 
systematic plundering of national resources. Yet since my generation at 
least entered the portals of manhood, this is what we have been seeing: 
politics and power being used as instruments for self-enrichment and 
personal aggrandisement, there being no exceptions to this rule since 
military men and civilian leaders have followed the same path.
    
Stalin, forget about his other faults, had few personal belongings at his 
death: no more than a few suits and a couple of military uniforms. Ho Chi 
Minh was a latter-day saint: perhaps too austere for our tastes but for all 
that a model of self- denial and self-abnegation. Castro enjoys the good 
things of life but the legacy he will leave behind is the Cuba he and his 
comrades have created and not any personal possessions.
    
If these examples be considered as too esoteric in the American-dominated 
world of today, consider a few others. Attlee had to write newspaper 
columns to supplement his pension when he was no more prime minister. 
Wilson during his long illness had to depend upon the daily allowances he 
got as member of the House of Lords in order to make both ends meet. 
Churchills estate at his death was not valued at more than a million 
pounds. Even the Clintons will have no vast personal fortune to fall back 
upon when they leave the White House.
    
But consider the Marcos or the Mobutu syndrome (Ardeshir Cowasjee having 
written on the latter only a few days ago) which is to be found in all its 
glory in tinpot dictatorships and Third World basket cases. Where this 
affliction stalks any country, power becomes an end in itself: wielded not 
for the public good but for lining ones pockets and amassing huge fortunes 
abroad. Marcos plundered the Philippines as Mobutu has plundered Zaire and 
brought a rich country to the verge of chaos and disintegration. But then 
Marcos and Mobutu are only metaphors in this argument. They represent a 
tendency which is to be seen in all countries with a wayward destiny.
    
But even if the gods have a hand in this misfortune, the Marcos syndrome 
does not cease to amaze. Power is a great gift because in the right hands 
it is the foremost instrument of ordering or re-arranging human affairs. 
This aspect of power puts it above even music and poetry. Nowhere in 
Napoleons correspondence is there a mention of Beethoven or Goethe who 
were his contemporaries. But Beethoven dedicated his Eroica Symphony to 
Napoleon (only to erase the dedication when Napoleon crowned himself 
emperor) and Goethe speaks with awe of Napoleons almost superhuman energy 
in his Conversations with Eckermann. To mention these events is merely to 
indicate the position that the man of power has held throughout history. 
Another example should serve to clinch this argument. For all the genius of 
ancient Greece, the high point of Greek civilisation is still remembered as 
the Age of Pericles, after the name of its greatest statesman.
    
And this precisely is where the matter falls because for power to create an 
impact on human existence it must be accompanied by vision and 
statesmanship. Consider then our predicament where power has been turned 
into a sordid thing, an instrument for amassing wealth that an ordinary 
shopkeeper or tradesman would envy. If there is a vision which walks the 
halls of power in the Islamic Republic it is not of Pericles or of Akbar 
(the very thought touching the heights of absurdity) but that of Duvalier, 
Marcos and Mobutu.
    
That this should be so is a measure of our national tragedy because there 
is nothing in Pakistans stars which condemns it to be a tinpot land or a 
basket case, a Haiti or a Burundi. Judged by the usual standards, it is a 
large country with human resources that, given the right prodding, can hold 
their own with any other on the face of the earth. South Asians are 
considered high achievers in the intensely competitive environment of North 
America. There is nothing in their destiny which condemns them to be low 
achievers in their own homelands.
    
Given these circumstances, is it all that far-fetched to say that the gift 
of power in our country is a great privilege on whomsoever it is bestowed? 
Yet look how this privilege is being exercised: not for the public good as 
it should be but for personal pomp and glory. That unappeasable greed is at 
work here is obvious. But in the shadows of this greed there also lurks a 
terrible sense of insecurity. It is as if power is a watery thing and the 
common good a mirage, of meaning only for lost travellers in the desert. 
What matters above all, and that which gives significance to power, is to 
insure against the future which is best done by grabbing what one can and 
by taking commissions on the rest. This in essence is the Marcos or Mobutu 
syndrome which has the Islamic Republic in its vice-like grip.
    
If there seemed to be some escape from this affliction, thinking men and 
women in Pakistan, while suffering the present as best as they can, would 
look to the future with hope. Pakistans current tragedy is that it has 
well nigh exhausted the vast reservoirs of romanticism with which it was 
born. Every experiment in the constitutional book has been tried but 
stability continues to elude us. Every political choice on offer has been 
tried with the only result of all this striving being that over the years 
the Marcos syndrome has been buttressed with pillars of iron. Today to no 
ones surprise the business of government stands discredited as never 
before.
    
Admittedly, there is much that is vibrant in this country. Step into the 
countryside or any small town and you will see the industry and spirit of 
enterprise which are keeping the wheels of national life moving. But what 
is thwarting the Pakistani people from realising their destiny and carving 
out an honourable place for themselves among the nations of the world are 
the uses to which the exercise of power has been harnessed.
    
It is not that Pakistan is waiting for a Pericles. That is a fat hope 
indeed. But what can even now turn around its affairs (because, whatever 
doomsayers might say, we have still not crossed the point of no return) is 
just a modicum of sincere and honest leadership. Not revolution or drastic 
surgery  alternatives which people in drawing rooms are much enamoured of 
 because revolutions do not come from the skies and they have to be worked 
for with blood and sacrifice. Just a modicum of honesty and integrity. Yet 
consider the Pakistani predicament that even though so little is needed to 
bring about a healthy change in the nations affairs, even that little is 
not forthcoming. All we seem to be getting instead are variations on the 
Marcos syndrome: great greed allied to supreme incompetence.
    
The budget, the Mirages whose acquisition will surely be the last straw on 
the economys back, the growing lawlessness in different parts of the 
country, the problems with the judiciary, and the other things which fill 
newspaper space are all items in the sum of the nations distress. The 
principal problem is one of national direction. Once that is hostage to the 
ghost of Marcos and the living example of Mobutu, it becomes a daunting 
task to struggle against other infirmities.

<a name="terr">Terrorism</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

THERE is no cause, no passion that is so stupendous in its righteousness 
that it can justify terrorism, leave alone venerate it. There is no valour 
in killing innocent men, women and children, no honour, no rewards here or 
hereafter.
    
Terrorism is the political name that is given to mass murder but what makes 
it different to murder is that it is random and targets the luckless, those 
who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Terrorism is 
indiscriminate in its callousness and even worse is cowardly. The man who 
planted a bomb in the lounge of the Lahore Airport may himself have been 
deranged or programmed for even hired killers are generally not so 
barbaric. But since it was a meticulously planned, cold-blooded operation 
those who were masters of the deed were professionals, an anonymous group 
of men carrying out the murder, or attempted murder of anonymous victims.
    
Terrorism is the most impersonal of crimes, there is no interaction between 
the perpetrators and the casualties, not even a nodding acquaintance 
between the killer and the killed. In war, at least, the enemy is clearly 
defined and those who fall upon the battle field can be said to have laid 
down their lives for their country. No such citation is available for the 
mangled bodies and debris from a terrorist bomb.
    
That there was a security lapse at the Lahore airport is stating the 
obvious. Whether an airport can be made wholly safe is something else. An 
airport is a public place and cannot be sealed off. Not only does it get 
thousands of visitors but hundreds of people work there. This is not to 
absolve the agencies concerned of laxness. Indeed, the instant reaction 
after the bomb blast was an attempt by the agencies to shift 
responsibility, in itself a sign that the security system is riddled with 
imperfections.
    
Any visitor to an airport will be made aware of the overbearing manner of 
the security staff but to be over-bearing is not the same as being 
vigilant. Purely as an aside, it has not struck the VIPs that their lounges 
are the most vulnerable, crowded as they are with a legion of flunkies who 
invariably come to receive or see a VIP off. No one dare check them! But 
the terrorists know that airports, bus stands, railway stations, markets, 
hospitals, mosques, wherever a large number of people are apt to congregate 
are soft targets. It is impossible to secure them. Are we then helpless?
    
Im afraid we are, as are people all over the world where the terrorist 
wages his mad war. What is possible, however, that these acts of terrorism 
should be condemned outrightly and unreservedly, without any ifs and buts 
by all sections of the public including political parties irrespective of 
their differences. An act of terrorism is an assault on Pakistan itself. 
Thats the only way to see the outrage of the bomb blast at Lahore Airport.
    
Unfortunately, the temptation to politicise these bomb blasts is too great 
to resist and it has become almost de rigueur, a standard knee-jerk 
reaction to score political points even before the dead are buried. It is 
sad, as it is infuriating, that instead of uniting the people so that there 
is a common resolve to combat terrorism, we begin to stone each other with 
agitational platitudes and provocative pieties, blaming each other after 
lip-service has been paid to condemning the hidden hand, I find it 
astonishing to read that some opposition members have called for the 
resignation of the government, the ostensible reason being its failure to 
protect sensitive areas like airports and for good measure, almost as an 
after-thought, the lives of poor people. What is the connection? How does 
one follow from the other?
    
It would have made sense had a blue-print of a water-tight security system 
been offered or it could have been satisfactorily proved that something 
like a bomb blast would not have occurred had they been the government. 
Should John Major resign because his government has failed to stop the 
IRAs campaign of terror? Tony Bair would be laughed out of the Commons 
were he to make such a demand. Should Bill Clinton have resigned because a 
group belonging to some lunatic-fringe militia blew up a government 
building in Oklahoma City or because TWAs flight 800 exploded in mid-air 
killing 230 people? What about the security at JFK Airport? The Republicans 
are not making hay.
    
There are any number of issues on which the government and the opposition 
have different views and perceptions. We are not short of areas of 
disagreement and perceptions. In a democracy, it is perfectly legitimate to 
take the government to task. But there is a no-go area or should be that 
comes in the category of the national interest and it is expected, if not 
incumbent on all to make common cause. We are not that strife-torn or so 
utterly divided that we cannot close ranks on something as evil as 
terrorism.
    
Why not an All Parties Conference with a single item on the agenda  
terrorism and how best to combat it. The message to our enemies would be 
loud and clear. Sometimes it is possible to raise the level of politics to 
the heights of statesmanship. And that is when we accept the geometric fact 
that no part is greater than the whole. It does not matter whether the 
initiative for such a conference is taken by the government or by the 
opposition. It would be welcomed by people from all walks of life, 
particularly since the victims of terrorism are likely to come from these 
walks of life.
    
And if these terrorist acts are the work of a hidden hand, it might be a 
good idea to start nabbing a few of the culprits. We must not give the 
impression that we are clueless, in both senses of the word!

<a name="nowo">No worthwhile moves made By Pakistani attackers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Anwar Ahmad Khan Former Olympian

Pakistan faces the prospects of missing the semi-final line-up, after the 
second successive loss in the Olympic hockey tournament in Atlanta. After 
being beaten what should be called by a wide margin by Spain, the green-
shirted Pakistanis have gone down to Germany.
   
With just a couple of points from three games against their name, Pakistan 
now has just an outside chance of reaching the semi-finals.
   
Yet Pakistan cant be written off. It has been a tradition in Pakistan 
hockey to come from behind and win the championship against all odds. There 
have been numerous occasions when Pakistan has ran away with the top 
position, after a rather shaky start. The Pakistanis were planning to pack 
up in the inaugural World Cup in Barcelona, Spain, in 1971, when Japan 
stunned Holland and Pakistan was allowed to move into the semi-finals. 
Pakistan went on to win the first World Cup.
   
The story was not much different in the 1984 Olympics at Los Angeles. By 
restricting Holland, Kenya paved the way for Pakistan to come back into the 
reckoning. And Pakistan proceeded to claim the gold medal.
   
Pakistan once again needs a miracle in Atlanta to take them through to the 
victory stand. If Pakistan is destined to win, nobody would be able to stop 
them from doing so. Argentina can surprise Germany or even USA can blow a 
whistle upon a couple of its fancied rivals to create an opening for 
Pakistan. It has happened in the past and theres no reason why it cant 
happen once again.
   
At the moment Pakistan is placed fifth in the group, with only hosts USA 
behind. Spain, the giant killers, stay on top in Group A with three 
successive victories while Argentina is positioned at number two. India and 
Germany have three points each from as many games but the former stay ahead 
in the points table due to better goal difference.
   
Pakistan played better against Germany, the defending champions, than they 
had done against Spain a couple of days ago. But Pakistan were not good 
enough to overcome the win-starved Germany.
   
Germany was under tremendous pressure, after having claimed just one point 
from their first couple of matches. They needed to defeat Pakistan in order 
to stay in the hunt for one of the  medals. They achieved their objective 
by sound planning.
   
Germany was successful in dominating the game, particularly in the second 
half, they gave very little away. In fact they were able to dictate terms 
after the break. I believe that the Germans were capable of playing even 
better. In my opinion, they played only up to seventy percent of their 
potential.
   
Pakistan made Germanys task easier by not playing up to the mark. The 
Pakistan forwards, frustrated by the strict man-to-man marking, failed to 
come up with any worthwhile move. They could not initiate combined 
movements, which could have tested the German defence.
   
Pakistan should have changed their strategy, when they were trailing. They 
had to attack the Germans in order to upset their gameplan. But as it 
turned out, the Pakistanis did not look threatening in their attacks due to 
the negligible support of their half-line.
 
It has always been advisable to exploit the right half or centre-half as 
the sixth forward, when the objective is to make inroads into a packed 
defence. Since so such effort was made, the Germans were happy in keeping 
the possession of the ball.
   
Centre-half Muhammad Khalid was not found up to the mark. I was expecting 
right-half Muhammad Usman, who had performed admirably in the World Cup, to 
rise to the occasion but he has been a disappointment so far. Left-half 
Irfan Mahmood has also been struggling to make his presence felt in the 
field.
   
I believe that Khwaja Junaid would have still performed the duties of a 
half back more skilfully than these guys. Then I have failed to understand 
the logic behind the omission of right out Asif Bajwa, who could have 
proved an asset for the side. He was trained for this job for three years 
but was not chosen for such an important competition.
   
In the absence of genuine wingers, the Pakistan forwardline had very little 
chance of forcing a breakthrough. Pakistans spearhead Kamran Ashraf, who 
is basically a dasher, did not get the kind of openings he was looking for. 
Neither the wingers sent in crosses to him nor the inners fed him properly.
   
Another strong point of Pakistan in the past has been attacking the 
opponents through the right trio. This could not function in the desired 
manner.
   
It was amazing to see a seasoned player like Tahir Zaman missing a penalty 
stroke in such an important game. He looked disturbed at having thrown away 
the golden chance and it would have been in the interest of the team to 
have rested him for ten minutes or so, taking advantage of the rolling 
substitution rule.
   
Shahbaz Ahmed has looked just a shadow of his own self in this particular 
tournament. Muhammad Shahbaz has yet to show his top form.
   
Goalkeeper Mansoor Ahmed, who is also the skipper of the team,  did save a 
penalty corner against Germany but he will have to perform even better to 
inspire his team.
   
Pakistan has to win both its remaining league matches handsomely to stay in 
the tournament. Both India as well as Argentina could prove to be tough 
opponents so Pakistan will have to perform exceptionally well to overpower 
them.

<a name="play">Pakistan played much below expectations</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Anwar Ahmad Khan Former Olympian

Pakistan and India played out a goalless draw in the Atlanta Olympic Games 
pool match on Friday. The nature of the result between the two countries 
was for the first time in international hockey since the final of the 1958 
Tokyo Asian Games. And like the late Pakistan inside-left Nasir Ahmad Bunda 
drew out the then Indian goalkeeper Shankar Laxman from his charge, his 
subsequent effort from point blank range unluckily went a trifle wide to 
keep the slate clean. This time around, Indias centre-forward Dhanraj 
Pillay connected a right winger Mukesh Kumar cross. However, he had to look 
up to the heavens in disgust as the ball hit the near post and rebounded 
into play for an identical scoreline.
    
It was the second occasion in Atlanta that Pakistan and India were engaged 
in a drawn skirmish. The last time was in the pre-Olympic tournament held 
in the month of April when the game ended in a two-all stalemate.
    
Pakistan had a highly experienced outfit in comparison to Indias, and as 
the reigning world champions, started out as favourites to win the tussle. 
But if that was not to be, it was simply because Pakistan played much below 
expectations.
    
To begin with, it seems strange that Pakistan benched its regular left back 
Naveed Alam, who also is pretty good in conversion of penalty corners, for 
the all-important encounter. He was replaced in that position by Rana 
Mujahid Ali, who has over a considerable period of time been playing as a 
right back.
    
If one man who stood out in the entire Pakistan defence it was young right 
back Danish Kalim. He was workmanlike in his approach and had an 
outstanding game. Besides, his two penalty corner strikes of the four 
Pakistan were awarded in both sessions, found the target but were 
disallowed for not hitting the 18-inch board.
    
The Pakistan half-line comprising Mohammad Usman, Mohammad Khalid and Irfan 
Mahmood were as usual listless and did not go up in support of their 
forwards. But if there was one silver lining, it was the grand spoiling 
role feigned by left half Irfan Mahmood who completely bottled up Indias 
right winger Mukesh Kumar.
    
Coming to the Pakistan forwardline, the two new wingers Mohammad Sarwar and 
Aleem Raza looked completely out of their depths at this level and are in 
dire need of plenty of international exposure to come up to the required 
standard. In a way, I expected a great deal from Mohammad Shahbaz, who was 
inducted as the playing inside-left for the first time, but I am sad to say 
he did not live up to the billing of former coach Manzoorul Hassan, who is 
on record, having said: We have found another Shahbaz Ahmad.
    
Inside-right Tahir Zaman was altogether off-colour and when he was 
substituted by Rahim Khan, the Pakistanis found some rhythm in their 
attacks. A few chances were created but were muffed by Kamran Ashraf, 
Mohammad Shahbaz and Shahbaz Ahmad. In crunch matches such missing is 
simply unpardonable.
    
Reverting to Indias game, it more or less assumed the same pattern as 
Pakistans. The defence was rock solid and held the Pakistan forwards at 
bay for most part of the proceedings.
 
Nevertheless, India can feel proud of the fact that they have a splendid 
left half in the making in Ramandeep Singh. He has a classic feeding style 
and is also good in busting up a onslaughts in its bud.
    
Indias reliance on centre-forward Dhanraj Pillay to deliver the goods 
faltered as he did not play in his position but kept inter-changing on 
either flank. To add to that, he is not in the same class like former 
Indian greats. Right winger Mukesh Kumar was the other man whom India 
largely counted upon. But only one flick pass to Dhanraj had the stamp of 
authority written all over it.
    
Although, there was a light shower in the first half the weather was very 
pleasant for hockey.
    
Even though, both Pakistan and India played with the traditional Asian 
flair with fluency of movement and without man-to-man marking, but lacking 
were the thrilling moves witnessed in a number of epic past Pakistan-India 
ties.

<a name="dram">Pakistans dramatic win in Lords Test</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, July 30: Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed, Pakistans formidable pair 
of pace and spin attack, cut to smithereens Englands batting line-up to 
give Pakistan a 164-run triumph on the last day of the first Test on Monday 
at Lords.
    
The England overnight batsmen, Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart, resisted 
firmly and with assurance up to the lunch time.  However, after resumption 
Mushtaq struck twice to dismiss both captain Atherton and Stewart with the 
help of substitute fielders, who took excellent catches. Then the 
procession started and the writing was lurid on the wall. Englands 
inevitable defeat came shortly after tea time.
    
Pakistan have gone one up in the series with captain Wasim Akram 
confidently claiming that Pakistan would clinch the series in the second 
Test at Headingley, starting on Aug 8.
    
Once the second wicket stand of 154 between Atherton and Alec Stewart was 
ended after lunch, England defences fell into bits as wickets fell and 
their batting succumbed.
    
The last nine wickets fell for the addition of only 75 runs and that too 
because of a 35-run desperate last-wicket stand between Ian Salisbury and 
Simon Brown.
    
England having resumed the last day at 74 for one were well in control at 
168, 20 minutes after lunch.
    
Mushtaq Ahmed, having conceded only 35 runs in his 25 overs without taking 
a wicket despite some close calls for both Atherton and Stewart, then 
struck while bowling round the wicket. From the rough the ball spun taking 
the edge of Athertons bat in the slip where Asif Mujtaba substituting for 
Aamir Sohail took a fine catch. There was no stopping after that dismissal. 
Later Stewart could not get his bat away from a delivery which rared off 
his pad to the bat and in the hands of silly point Moin Khan fielding for 
Inzamam-ul-Haq.
    
Their exit in quick succession, after Atherton had made 64 and Stewart 89, 
was what Pakistan looked for. There was no stopping them as the rest 
collapsed like a pack of cards and Pakistan clinched a well earned win just 
before a delayed tea break.
    
Athertons 278 minutes vigil at the crease in which he had managed eight 
fours at one time appeared to have done the trick but trouble was in store 
soon after his demise.

Nothing really can be taken away from Pakistan from their third Test 
victory at Lords in the last four Tests since 1982. It was a team effort 
in which everyone played his part.

<a name="fail">Pakistan fail to reach semi-finals</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sydney Friskin

ATLANTA, July 27: Nearly 15,000 spectators gathered at the Morris Brown 
College Stadium to witness the Olympic hockey match between Pakistan and 
India and went away disappointed that no goals were scored.
    
There were those who appreciated the scientific possibilities of the game; 
others thought it was all so pointless, statisticians were busy looking up 
their records, attempting to find out when an Olympic hockey match between 
these two great countries had ended goalless.
    
In short it was a match that promised much and achieved little. The upshot 
is that neither Pakistan nor India will qualify for the semi-finals in 
which Spain, after their 7-1 victory over the United States later in the 
night, made sure of their place in the last four from Pool A. Germany seem 
likely to accompany them.
    
India more than Pakistan needed the two points at stake. Had they won they 
would have had a total of five with one more match to play against Spain 
they would have been in with a fighting chance with a total of seven 
points.
    
If Pakistan had won they could at most have finished their engagements with 
a total of six points which would not have been enough. They could not pick 
themselves off the floor after defeats by Spain and Germany.

<a name="both">Botham, Lamb lose libel case against Imran</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Athar Ali

LONDON, July 31: By an overwhelming majority the jury in the High Court 
libel action brought by two former England Test cricketers, Ian Botham and 
Allan Lamb, against Imran khan gave its verdict in favour of the defendant.
    
The jury rejected claims for damages made by the two plaintiffs who alleged 
that the former Pakistan captain in the media interviews cast serious 
aspersions on them by calling them both racists and questioning their 
upbringing. Botham also failed to convince the jury that Imran Khan had 
accused him of ball-tempering and of cheating. The plaintiffs will have to 
bear not only their own legal costs but also pay the cost incurred by the 
defendant with some adjustments made for the withdrawal of the `plea of 
justification made by Imran on the basis of two television clips from the 
1982 Tests which sowed Botham handling the ball.
    
Botham and Lamb will have to pay an estimated 500,000 pounds in total 
costs.
    
It took the seven men, five women jury more than four hours to reach their 
verdict. When they returned to the court room, filled to capacity, the jury 
foreman told the judge, Mr Justice French, that they had reached a verdict. 
The court clerk asked the foreman whether on the action brought by Ian 
Botham and Allan Lamb together that in an India Today interview Imran Khan 
had accused them of racism and questioned their class and upbringing they 
were for the plaintiffs or the defendant. For the defendant came the 
reply in a hushed court room. The jury foreman was then asked if they had 
reached a verdict for the plaintiff, Ian Botham, or the defendant in the 
separate libel action brought by the England cricketer accusing Imran Khan 
that he indirectly accused him of ball-tampering which under the laws of 
the game amounts to cheating.
    
A sigh of relief was breathed by Imran who for a few moments was unable to 
grasp what the jury foreman had said. His wife, Jemima, who sat next to him 
on the front bench in the court room, wearing a maroon-coloured maxi, did 
realise the importance of the moment and drew close to her husband. When it 
became clear that the verdict had gone for the defendant, Imran looked 
towards the courtroom ceiling with eyes almost full of tears of boy. He 
hugged his wife and a broad smile appeared on his face, and the pale 
complexion that he was wearing for the last two days due to tension soon 
disappeared.
    
Outside the Royal Courts of Justice, where hundreds of people stood inside 
the railing set up by the police in the expectation of verdict in the case 
of the three cricket stars which had entered the 13th day today. Imran Khan 
said he had been vindicated. He thanked God almighty for it.
 
The four-year-old ball-tampering controversy and the tabloid accusations 
made against Pakistani cricketers in 1992 of cheating were revived as 
witness after witness spoke about the ball-tampering controversy. Botham 
was accused of an obsession with Pakistan.. Imran with passion defended his 
position. He said he did not call anyone a cheat nor a racist. He was only 
trying to bring into the open the ball-tampering controversy. He found 
support from big names in the cricket world who said this has gone in for 
as long as cricket began and is now an accepted practice. The controversy 
will rage until resolved, as Imran said after and during the trial, but his 
thirteen day ordeal in court in full public gaze and the worry of the last 
two years when the libel action against him was brought has finally ended.
