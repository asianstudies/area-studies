------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

Sixty one people, including ten MQM activists, were killed in the 
city. Eleven vehicles were also set on fire in terrorism-related 
incidents in Districts East, South, Central and West of Karachi.

Among the years victims were 222 members of law enforcement agencies 
who were ambushed, or killed after being kidnapped while at least 130 
MQM activists were killed in encounters as claimed by police or in 
judicial custody.

The MQM leader, Mr Altaf Hussain, has condemned the killing of three 
of his party workers Mohammad Arshad Qureshi, Mairaj Ahmad and 
Mohammad Salim.

<a name="moha">Mohajirs committed to defend Pakistan: Dehlavi</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Dec. 28: MQM chief negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi ruled out any 
possibility of a cooperation with the government till it relents in 
its excesses against the Mohajirs.
    
Mr Dehlavi said the government used the card of negotiations as 
licence to kill in Karachi. How could the negotiations continue when 
the government failed to honour its commitments made earlier? And how 
could it be believed that any agreement reached during parleys would 
be implemented? he asked.

He said the allegations that MQM wanted to dismember Sindh and 
separate Karachi from the country, were as baseless as saying that 
the sun rose from the west today. Mohajirs had created Pakistan and 
they could not even think of its dismemberment.
    
Mr Dehlavi said Mohajirs were ready to smash the heads of those who 
had dismembered the country. If required they would indulge in 
terrorism to fight those who were conspiring to break the country.
    
He said in Karachi 13,000 innocent people had been killed so far. The 
extent of economic damage was around Rs 500 billion in Karachi alone 
and the government was still claiming that everything was alright, he 
said adding: It means the government would not realise the gravity of 
the situation till the political suicide of the nation and the country 
was complete.
    
Continuing, Mr Dehlavi asked: Was it democracy to do all the wrong 
things and to seek oppositions cooperation on matters of mutual 
interests? Was it democracy to file cases against Mr Sharif and his 
family? Was it correct to imprison Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, and prepare to 
attack Dera Bugti over political differences with Nawab Akbar Bugti? 
Or to persecute the MQM and register countless cases against Altaf 
Hussain?
    
He said if all Muslim League factions joined hands, the country could 
get rid of the situation.

the High Court of Sindh against the arrest and detention of her 
husband, a former mayor of Hyderabad and MQM MNA and MPA.
    
Mr Rajput was arrested in Karachi on Saturday and the petition was 
admitted for regular hearing by the court and Jan 2 has been fixed for 
the purpose.

defending Mrs Rajput.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

KARACHI, Dec. 31: The MQM Coordination Committee called upon 
human rights organisations to exert their influence for the release of 
former deputy mayor of Hyderabad and National Assembly member Rashid 
Ahmed Rajput.

The coordination committee termed his arrest part of the governments 
policy of political victimisation.
    
He said the arrest of Mr Rajput exposed the hollow claims of the 
government that it believes in human rights and democratic values and 
wants to solve the problem through negotiation.
    
It appealed to all democratic forces to come to the aid of Mr Rajput.

<a name="mqmp">MQM protest</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 2: The MQM coordination committee has called for a day 
of protest on Thursday to mourn the deaths of its four activists in 
fake encounters with police and the rangers.
    
It has threatened with indefinite strike  if extra-judicial 
killings of the Mohajirs continued. The MQM has asked transporters 
to keep their vehicles off the road, schools should remain closed 
alongwith industry and other business activities.
    
Two army officers were among those killed in various encounters in the 
city on Monday. Police had blamed the Naeem Sherri group for allegedly 
taking part in the kidnapping and killing of the hostages.
    
Authorities had accused that 17 MQM activists had participated in that 
operation.
    
The MQM alleges that its four activists, Mohammad Saleem, Mohammad 
Naseem Ahmed, Akram Pervaiz and Shabbir were arrested in the first and 
second weeks of December during raids by the law enforcement agencies. 
After keeping them in illegal detention and subjecting them to 
torture, they were killed on Tuesday in Gharibabad.
    
Our London Correspondent adds: Mr Altaf Hussain, leader of the MQM 
also endorsed the strike call. In a statement he alleged that four 
activists of the party were killed in a faked encounter. He urged 
the human rights organisations to protest to the government against 
the killings of Mohajirs.

<a name="ifri">If rights denied, province will be demanded: Afaq</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 2: MQM Haqiqi chief Afaq Ahmed said on Tuesday that if 
the rights of the Mohajirs were not accepted, a demand for a separate 
province might become inevitable.
    
He said continuing socio-economic and political injustices had 
alienated the Mohajirs and compelled them to think of seeking a 
separate province within the geographic boundaries of Pakistan. Mr 
Ahmed reaffirmed his demand for launching a movement for a separate 
province if the rights of the Mohajirs were not given to them by June.
    
The Haqiqi chief regretted that some members of the Sindh Assembly had 
equated his demand with sedition and anti-Pakistan activities. We are 
not asking for the division of Sindh, we are only asking for justice 
and equal rights as Pakistanis as enshrined in the Constitution of 
Pakistan, said Mr Ahmed, and added that any decision about the 
division of Sindh had to be taken by the federal government in 
consultation with the provincial leadership.
    
He, nevertheless, pointed out that demanding a separate province 
within the limits of Pakistan was not against the integrity of the 
country.
    
Recalling historical records, Mr Ahmed contended that Sindh had always 
been divided in more than one political and administrative unit. In 
this context he mentioned that Hyderabad, Umarkot, Khairpur and 
Shikarpur had been a separate political entities when the Britishers 
occupied Sindh, and added that until the formation of One Unit, 
Khairpur had existed as a separate political unit.
    
He refuted the allegations by some members of the Sindh Assembly that 
the Mohajirs were trying to usurp the right of the Sindhis.
    
Mr Ahmed alleged those who were opposed to accepting the legitimate 
rights of the Mohajirs and obstructing the creation of a separate 
province were, in fact, helping Altaf Hussain to create a separate 
country.

<a name="alta">Altaf urges people to get rid of PPP govt</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Jan 3: A call for the people of Pakistan to get rid of the PPP 
government has been made by the Mohajir Qaumi Movement leader Altaf 
Hussain who said that they should make a joint effort to save the 
country.
    
In a statement he said the Pakistan Peoples Party, has given the 
country bullets instead of food, shrouds instead of clothing and 
graves instead of shelter. He said the PPP has never proved to be a 
good Omen for the country, and whenever it came into power it ruined 
the economy, made life difficult for the people and has harmed the 
security, integrity and the territorial boundaries of Pakistan.
    
The Mohajirs, he alleged, have particularly been targeted and many 
have been killed following their arrests. To prolong its control of 
the Government, the PPP is using the state machinery against the 
Mohajirs so as to create a gulf between them and the armed forces.
    
The MQM leader accused the government of taking the country to the 
brink. He appealed to the patriotic elements not to remain silent and 
leave the Mohajirs in a lurch, as it would mean abandoning the safety 
and the territorial integrity of the country.

<a name="pmlu">PML unification talks stalemated </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Dec. 28: The PML(N) and the PML(J) have lost interest as well 
as hope for reunification of the two factions as a result of which no 
date has been fixed for the third round of talks on the subject. 
However, neither side is ready to accept responsibility for the 
deadlock.
    
Interestingly, they made the same statement many times before when 
contacted by this correspondent on the subject of further unity talks 
between the two groups.
    
Some PML(N) sources though told Dawn that their party had reached the 
conclusion that the cost of reunification of the two groups was too 
heavy for the PML(N) to pay than the benefits it could expect in 
return.
    
During the first two rounds of talks, sources said the PML(J) had set 
its conditions for unity with the PML(N). These conditions were that 
in the new organisational set-up, both factions should have equal 
share in the top two offices of the party. This means the PML(N) and 
the PML(J) should nominate presidents of the two provinces each, and 
where the president is from one faction, the Secretary-General should 
belong to the other.
    
Also, the PML(J) demanded that all its MNAs, MPAs who remained 
steadfast with the party in all situations should be given PML tickets 
at the time of next elections.
    
The PML(N) has yet to give its formal response to these demands.
    
The PML(N) sources say the party is already repenting its decision of 
shaking hand with former Punjab chief minister Manzoor Wattoo who, 
PML(N) President Nawaz Sharif said on many occasions, was the biggest 
of all political turncoats. Party leaders have reached the conclusion 
that Mr Wattoos alliance with the PML(N) has not been liked by the 
people and they think that Mr Nawaz Sharif has made a major political 
mistake by having an alliance with Mr Wattoo.

Pakistan Muslim League was a single party and it was unnatural for 
it to be divided into factions.
    
He hoped that the good sense and goodwill would prevail and all 
Leaguers would again sit down together in the larger national 
interest. He however clarified that the reunification was possible 
only on principles.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz seeks govts proposals on Karachi</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Dec. 28: Disappointed over the rejection of his formula for 
improving situation in Karachi, opposition leader Nawaz Sharif asked 
the government to offer counter proposal within three days. He said if 
the nation accepted the governments formula, he would have no 
hesitation in accepting it.
    
The opposition leader said he had proposed a neutral chief executive 
for Sindh with complete sincerity so that the inferno in Karachi 
could be extinguished. By rejecting it, he regretted, the government 
had surprised the entire nation including the MQM.
    
Insisting that mid-term elections had become indispensable for the 
integrity of the country, the PML(N) president said he was not making 
the demand to become once again the prime minister.
    
Situation in the country, he alleged, had gone out of the control of 
what he called the incompetent, incapable and corrupt government.
    
Referring to the cooperation requests made by the prime minister, he 
said he was not willing to join hands with her in promoting killings, 
inflation, unemployment, corruption, lawlessness, political 
victimisation and excesses in Karachi.

<a name="want">Nawaz wants govt MNAs to resign</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Dec. 29: Reacting sharply on Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos 
challenge to opposition legislators to resign  en bloc  and contest 
the elections again to check their popularity, the opposition leader, 
Mian Nawaz Sharif, has proposed that if treasury members also resign 
and contest again it will give the electorate a fair chance to elect 
the popular leadership.
    
Taking a strong exception to Ms Bhuttos statement, Mr Sharif argued 
that if mid-term polls were not held on the demand of the opposition 
parties, the people would themselves take to the streets within three 
to four months to agitate against the government policies, forcing it 
to quit power and to hold fresh general elections. How long can they 
tolerate the unprecedented price-hike of essential goods, corruption 
and increasing rate of crimes, he asked.
    
As far as Benazir Bhuttos challenge to the opposition to re- check 
its popularity after quitting from the assemblies is concerned, I 
would like to draw her attention to the outcome of all the by-
elections in the Punjab and the NWFP since the 1993 general elections, 
in which only opposition parties candidates were returned to the 
assemblies, he said, maintaining that this singular factor was enough 
to reply to her challenge.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 30: Leader of the opposition and President of PML 
Mohammad Nawaz Sharif has said solution of the long-standing Kashmir 
issue in accordance with the UN resolution is inevitable for 
establishing good relations between India and Pakistan.

Taking exception to out of context playing up by the official media 
of his interview the Islamabad-based correspondent of the Indian 
newspaper The Hindu Nawaz Sharif said he had clearly stated in his 
interview that India would have to resolve the Kashmir issue in 
accordance with the UN resolutions.

The PML chief said: We reject any third option or the idea of 
independent Kashmir. He said he had stated in his interview that 
elections in the occupied Kashmir would tantamount to add fuel to 
fire.

Nawaz Sharif clarified that he had categorically stated in his 
interview that he would support negotiations between India and 
Pakistan on Kashmir if India is agreeable to resolving the issue 
according to the UN resolutions.

He said: If India settles the dispute through UN resolutions today, 
we will be ready to established good relations with her.

KARACHI, Jan 2: The PML President and leader of the opposition, Nawaz

both in terms of economic and law and order situation, owing to the 
present regimes wrong policies.
    
Terming the Karachi situation grave, he held the government 
responsible for the citys worsening law and order situation. Karachi 
crisis can be solved within weeks if the government is removed, the 
former premier claimed.
    
Lambasting the government for creating a financial mess, he alleged 
that because of mismanagement, the country was drifting towards 
bankruptcy.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 28: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said India was

Bhutto denied Indian claims that the Pakistani militarys Inter-
Services Intelligence (ISI) was involved in a mystery air-drop of 
weapons over eastern India.
    
India has raised the bogey of Pakistani involvement in a bid to hide 
its plan to explode a nuclear device, she said, and added that the 
Indian leadership was also trying to cover up its domestic problems 
including its failure in suppressing the freedom struggle in 
Kashmir.
    
She charged India with helping the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM), which 
is blamed by her government for the unrest in Karachi.

should come to the House and if they think there is any injustice they 
can air their grievances in the House.
    
The Chief Minister also referred to Altaf Hussains threatening 
statement and said the man who was sitting thousands of miles away 
should come back and face the courts. He said that Altaf Hussain was 
playing someone elses game and working on some one elses 
instigations.
    
Syed Abdullah Shah also mentioned that India has started a drama that 
some planes are throwing weapons in India. He pointed out that in the 
past India had staged a similar drama that its plane was hijacked to 
Lahore and thus closed the route between the then East and West 
Pakistan.
 
He also referred to false propaganda by leaders, including Nawaz 
Sharif, and added that the very purpose of such an exercise was to 
encourage terrorists; which the Chief Minister can never give in to.

many more decades should we still want to waste?

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 30: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan would 
not open trade with India without ensuring an even playing field for 
its own industry.

Commenting on a recent interview of opposition leader Nawaz Sharif to 
an India daily in which he had supported the idea of free trade with 
India, she said if the opposition leader had some concrete proposal 
than he should take the government into confidence.

Pakistan, being a member of World Trade Organisation (WTO), was 
conferring with India and other member countries to fulfil its 
international commitments, she said adding that relations between 
India and Pakistan could not normalise till the resolution of Kashmir 
issue.

PESHAWAR, Jan 2: Mr Jehanzeb Khan, who declared himself as caretaker 
acting president of the federation of Pakistan chambers of commerce 
and industry, has administered a note of caution to the government on 
establishing trade ties with India and giving it the status of Most 
Favoured Nation. He asked the government to take immense care and seek 
the consent of the business community so that trade impact should not 
affect Pakistans economy.
    
he said that all decisions regarding the trade relationship should be 
in the interest of the Pakistani business community so that the 
manufacturers and investors should not suffer.
    
He also demanded that the government should drop the names of 
exporters and Industrialists from the Exit Control List if it wants to 
strengthen economy and develop strong trade relationship with other 
regional states.
    
He regretted that the business class which contributes about 70 
billion rupees in taxes and 9 billion dollars in exports to the 
national exchequer is totally neglected today.
    
He criticised the government economic policies disclosing that the 
foreign reserves have shrinked to only 1.2 billion dollars due to 
capital flight and uncertain political situation in the country. He 
informed the current devaluation of rupee was more then 7 per cent 
contrary to the govt claim. He said, if the government co-operates the 
business community can work as a bridge between the business 
communities of other states.

The General is an active member of the Harkat-i-Inqilab-i-Islami of 
Maulvi Mohammad Nabi and a close aide of President Rabbani. The 
intelligence agencies which are suspecting Afghan involvement in the 
blast had prepared a list of the Pro-Rabbani refugees and 
functionaries of the Kabul government in Peshawar sometime back. They 
have now started crackdown on them in various parts of the province in 
an attempt to solve the bomb blast mystery.
    
Afghan and Arab families in Peshawar are living in fear as the 
intelligence personnel have picked up hundreds of people in a 
clandestine operation and women and children of those arrested were 
not properly informed about there whereabouts.
    
Intelligence personnel who have arrested the general for his alleged 
involvement in the bomb blast were maintaining silence. They suspect 
that the General had provided a vehicle to the terrorist which was

of terrorism and most probably the Afghans could be involved.
   
He urged the government to keep its hands off from meddling in the 
Afghan affairs and leave that nation to decide their internal affairs 
at their own. This, he said, was necessary in the wake of withdrawal 
of Soviet forces and Rabbani.
    
He described Peshawar blast as a national tragedy which should have 
been faced with national zeal and the sabotage should have been

<a name="imra">Imrans statement criticised</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 28: Running a charitable institution and pursuing 
politics are two different things, and amalgam of both is simply not 
possible, Sarfraz Nawaz, a former fast bowler and Adviser on Sports, 
said.
    
In a press statement, he asked Imran Khan, to define what he is up 
to?.
    
It is not the government which is damaging the cause of a charity 
organisation, but instead, it is Imran himself, who has drifted away 
from his earlier declared goal and prefers to indulge in politics.
    
The government on its part, he stated, has in the past allowed 
maximum-permissible tax concessions to the hospital. In this context, 
he cited the availed permission to import a tax- free camera worth two 
million dollars, besides arranging for free PIA tickets, etc.
    
About the matter of advertisement of the hospital on television, he 
said, the PTV has a set policy.
    
An advertisement and a political statement are two separate things. 
If there is a political content or overtone in the guise of an 
advertisement, it naturally cant fall within the bracket of an 
advertisement. This simply is the case with Imran, he said.
    
In the case of Imran, the people know that he is indulging in 
politics and is giving political statements, he cannot claim to be 
running a purely welfare venture. He is only forwarding his politics 
in the garb of charity, which is abhorable by any standards, he said.
    
Sarfraz said, there could not be any comparison of the institution 
being run by Imran with Edhi or Hameed Khan Trust. If they (Edhis 
and Hameeds) are allowed to advertise their charitable tasks, they 
could genuinely do so as they rightly are charitable institutions 
but, Imran Khan is running an institution which is a mix of charity 
and politics.
    
It is high time, he said, that Imran defines and decides as to what is 
the nature of his institution.

above the law and every citizen of the country is duty bound to submit 
income tax and wealth tax information. So that, he added, Imran should 
not show reluctance to give information about his income tax.

medical facilities to the poor but government had banned its

that hawks which want to propagate (India-Pakistan) tensions are 
flying high in India.
    
The spokesman affirmed that Pakistan respected the sovereignty of all 
foreign governments and declared that Islamabad harboured and 
aggressive designs against India. The spokesman, however, declined to 
deny or confirm whether the alleged flights which New Delhi 
intercepted before levelling arms-drop charges originated from 
Karachi. But, he claimed, that as a rule Pakistan carried put checks 
of overflights.

KARACHI, Dec. 28: The Sindh Assembly unanimously adopted a motion 
condemning the statement of Afaq Ahmed, chairman of MQM Haqiqi, 
regarding separate province for Mohajirs or dividing Sindh.
    
The chief minister, however, stressed the need for searching our own 
souls as to why after half a century some people have an impression 
that they are not being treated properly; this impression needs to be 
erased from their minds, he said.

<a name="toug">Tough task ahead for NFC</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aslam Sheikh

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 28: The quest for a new deal for tax-sharing between 
the federation and the provinces has now been launched after the 
inauguration of the reconstituted National Finance Commission by the 
prime minister. But the indications after the first meeting are that 
it will be a tough assignment over the next few months.
    
Distribution of taxes collected by the centre has been a controversial 
issue since the early years of Pakistan. While the new constitutional 
arrangement every five years is now virtually settled by a consensus 
among Islamabad and provinces, the NFC decisions are still mistakenly 
called Award rather than an accord hammered out by mutual give-and-
take by the centre and the provinces.
    
How the provincial share from the federal pool is to be distributed 
among the provinces has also become a contentious issue again. Punjab 
reportedly is seeking special royalty for some of its commodities 
because the one on oil and gas plus electricity has transferred 
substantial resources mainly to the NWFP and Balochistan, and to a 
lesser degree to Sindh. Punjab seems to be of the view that its per 
capita share in the divisible pool is the lowest notwithstanding the 
size of its population. Besides it has also been deprived of proceeds 
from export duty on cotton and rice now abolished.
    
The fact that there has been no fresh census since 1981 has encouraged 
some to challenge the suitability of population factor as the basis 
for the distribution of taxes among provinces. This position is mainly 
taken by the NWFP and Balochistan seeking weightage in the share of 
taxes because of their larger development needs. While Punjab and 
Sindh favour the retention of population as the basis of tax 
distribution, they also have their differences on the choice of the 
year as the basis of such distribution. Demographic changes have 
increased percentage share of Sindh in total population (from 17.9 in 
1951 to 22.6 in 1981) and reduced that of Punjab from 60.8 per cent in 
1951 to 56.1 in 1981.
    
The NFC will have to move cautiously in dealing with these sensitive 
issues to avoid further accentuation of inter-provincial controversies 
because of the on-going uneasy political situation. It needs to be 
remembered that economic issues and uneven distribution of resources 
among provinces became major factors in creating the situation which 
led to 1971 disaster. The issues involved in the NFC deliberations 
must, therefore, be sorted out through maximum consensus and mutual 
accommodation.

<a name="upro">Uproar in Senate over Shahbazs transfer</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 28: The shifting of Shahbaz Sharif from Adiala to 
Attock prison resulted in a double embarrassment for the government, 
which not only had to grudgingly assure his return but also painted 
itself into a legal corner over the issue of the jurisdiction of 
courts in allowing incarcerated parliamentarians to attend the 
proceedings.
    
Proving that rank had its privileges, the opposition senators raised a 
hue and cry over the shifting of Shahbaz Sharif, who is not even a 
member of their house, but obviously his being the brother of the 
leader of the opposition, made all the necessary difference.
    
Minister of State for Law Raza Rabbani tried playing down the whole 
affair by describing it as a necessary administrative measure.
    
At this point, Chairman Wasim Sajjad, himself an ace lawyer, at once 
took on Rabbani on a very pertinent legal objection. He asked Rabbani 
to inform the House about the identity of the court on whose orders 
you had Shahbaz moved from one prison to another. He pointedly 
reminded Rabbani that the government had repeatedly refused to produce 
the arrested senators despite his ruling on the grounds of them being 
in the courts custody and not in the governments and added but now 
you have suddenly moved him on your own.
    
While Rabbani mumbled something inaudible, Sajjad concluded his biting 
discourse by advising the government that it would still be better if 
you honour the rulings and the House. By this time Rabbani, too, 
seemed to have composed his thoughts and informed the House that the 
relevant court had already been moved.
    
Rabbanis statement did not satisfy the agitating senators who, after 
shooting off a barrage of angry speeches, staged a boycott of the 
proceedings until the government came up with a categorical stance on 
the issue. At this point the interior minister Gen (retd) Naseerullah 
Babar also promised to look into the matter despite its being a 
provincial matter.
    
Babar assured the House that Shahbaz would be brought back to 
Adiala, requesting the opposition members in the same breath to 
curtail their visits to the jail. He, however, did not give any time 
frame for Shahbazs return from Attock.

PESHAWAR, Dec. 28: The NWFP Chief Minister, Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, 
reacted sharply to the Leader of Opposition, Mian Nawaz Sharifs 
demand that the Sindh government should be removed immediately. Mr 
Sherpao, in a statement, termed the demand as a negation of both the 
democratic norms and the Constitution.
    
The chief minister said that the leader of the opposition should have 
refrained from issuing such an irresponsible statement. Mr Sherpao 
said that the Abdullah Shah government in Sindh was a constitutionally 
elected government, and it was enjoying the support of the majority in 
the Sindh Assembly as well as among the people of the province.
    
He urged the opposition leader to desist from issuing such 
irresponsible statements which amounted to undermining the norms of 
democracy.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 30: The chairman and other leaders of the Milli Yekjehti 
Council (MYC) expressed their gratitude to the people for observing a 
complete and peaceful wheel-jam strike throughout the country.
    
Maulana Noorani thanked the PML, the MQM and the MQM (H) also for 
extending their support in making the strike a most successful one.   
Asked whether there was any chance of cooperation with the PML in view 
of its support for the strike, Maulana Noorani said: Chances of 
reaching understanding with the PML have brightened.

At the outset of his Press conference, Maulana Noorani alleged that 
the government not only harassed workers of the MYC component parties 
during its Fridays protest day and on Saturdays countrywide strike, 
arrested 200 workers, raided the city Jamaat-i-Islami office twice, 
used baton-charge against workers in Lahore and Sheikhupura.

Accusing the United States of instigating sectarian clashes in 
Pakistan, Maulana Noorani alleged the US by weakening our country 
could use our territory against Iran.

Mian Raza Rabbani said that leader of the oppositions demand for a 
neutral and un-elected set-up in Sindh to pave the way for resolving 
the Karachi problem was an anti- democratic approach.
    
Mr Rabbani said the government had inherited the problem of terrorism 
in Karachi which became more serious after the army operation launched 
by the Sharif government. That operation, he claimed, had not only 
resulted in the fragmentation of the MQM but also added to the 
problems of the Urdu-speaking people in Karachi .
    
He also flayed the opposition leader for bringing judiciary into 
disrepute which, he claimed, was independent and functioning according 
to the law.  He said the government was fully aware of the Karachi 
problem and was doing its utmost to solve it through administrative 
and political means.

Naseer Ahmad

KARACHI, Dec. 30: Federal Minister for Law and Parliamentary Affairs 
Prof N. D. Khan, stressing the need for resolving national issues 
through dialogue, criticised the Milli Yekjehtis strike call and 
Nawaz Sharifs demand for an alternative formula for the Karachi 
issue.
    
He said the government was ready to be guided through talks as the 
nation needed conciliation and not confrontation. Lashing out at 
Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif for his reported demand for an 
alternative formula for solving the Karachi issue, he instead blamed 
the problem on Mr Sharif himself saying it was he who had handed over 
the city to the army.
    
He asked the opposition leader to dissociate himself from terrorists 
and this is our alternative formula for resolving the issue. The 
minister said he wanted to know the former prime ministers response 
to the demand for division of Sindh.
    
He advised opposition legislators to wait till 1998 for elections. If 
they do not have enough patience, they would better enjoy recreation 
abroad, he remarked.
    
He criticised the demand for a presidential system in the country and 
said the present parliamentary system suited it most. The country can 
afford no more experiments, he said and added that the present 
institutions needed to be strengthened.
    
If there is no political stability, there will be no economic 
stability as well, he said.

resuming the stalled talks, Federal Minister for Law and Parliamentary 
Affairs N.D. Khan said the opposition could not be absolved of its 
responsibility toward the restoration of peace and normality to 
Karachi.
Mr Khan said both the government and the opposition had equal 
responsibility in this regard.

Commenting on opposition leader Mian Nawaz Sharifs statement asking 
the government to come up with a solution to the problem within three 
days, Mr Khan said: He owes equal responsibility toward bringing 
improvement in the Karachi situation as it is of vital importance to 
national security.
    
Mr Khan flayed the opposition leader for criticising the government 
for the situation in Karachi and other parts of the province but not 
condemning the acts of terrorism in which innocent people had lost 
lives, and economy had been badly affected.
    
Mr Khan said that the attitude of Mian Nawaz Sharif was becoming 
negative and counter- productive day by day.  He has been engaged in 
destabilising the government from the day one.
    
The chief government negotiator said that being the leader of the 
major opposition party, Mr Sharif should have pursued his own agenda 
rather than followed the agenda of other parties.
    
It was he who had handed over the Sindh province and Karachi to the 
army on June 19, 1992, and today he was asking for solving the Karachi 
problem within three days.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent  

QUETTA, Dec. 30: Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Northern 
Areas, Afzal Khan, has said that MQM and other opposition parties 
should come forward with concrete proposals to pave the way for the 
solution of Karachi crisis.

MQM is a reality and without participation of this party no political 
talks could succeed for the resolution of Karachi crisis, said 
federal minister. He said that frequent strikes, support to terrorist 
activities and violence was not solution of the Karachi crisis and it 
would bring more difficulties and problems for the people of this 
city.

He said that Prime Minister had already extended an invitation to 
opposition leader Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif for political dialogues 
on various important issues including Karachi crisis but PML-N Chief 
refused to accept this offer.

Opposition leader should accept the invitation of Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto and they should sit together to develop consensus on 
national issues including nuclear programme, Kashmir and restoration 
of peace to Karachi, Afzal Khan added.

He said that differences between political leaders and parties on 
different issues is part of democracy but it should not be turned into 
personal enmity.

Replying to a question about Kalabagh Dam, Mr. Afzal Khan said that 
although PQP was strongly against the construction of this huge dam in 
NWFP but we could not support any terrorist and unconstitutional way 
to sabotage the construction of this dam.

Construction of Kalabagh Dam is a matter of our life and death and 
our party would continue its opposition without any compromise, said 
Mr Khan.

He said that three provinces viz; Balochistan, Sindh and NWFP were 
opposing this project and the provincial assemblies of all the three 
provinces also adopted unanimous resolutions against the construction 
of the Dam.

<a name="govt">Govt castigated for governing through ordinances</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick   

ISLAMABAD, Jan 1: Law Minister N.D.Khans hope of a smooth rendering 
of item three of the days agenda was dashed when the opposition 
senators castigated the government for governing through ordinances.
    
The item pertained to the laying of no less than 11 presidential 
ordinances before the House, with a fair share consisting of those 
being repromulgated.

The issue was brought up rather surprisingly by Sen Manzoor Gichki, 
incidentally an ally of the ruling party. Not surprisingly, however, 
the senator was immediately swamped by the whole- hearted support of 
the opposition which was more than eager to agitate an issue that has 
been proving a constant source of embarrassment for the government. 
Even the president had registered his disapproval with the pace of 
ordinances in his address to the joint parliamentary session.
    
While both N.D.Khan and his deputy, Raza Rabbani, were present, the 
law minister left it to Mr Rabbani to defend the government. In his 
counter- arguments, the minister of state for law reasoned that the 
Supreme Court did not bar the government from issuing ordinances, 
and advised the opposition to revert to the court to seek a detailed 
interpretation of its verdict. He said parliamentarians could not 
interpret the verdict of the Supreme Court.
    
At this point Aftab Sheikh, an accomplished lawyer himself, 
interjected by arguing that while the House could not debate the 
verdict of the court it could surely discuss the issue in the light of 
the Constitution. He asked the law minister to explain the emergency 
behind issuing ordinances as warranted in Article 89 of the 
Constitution. He said most of the subjects covered by these ordinances 
did not even qualify as being of emergency nature, let alone of 
proving an emergency.

<a name="thee">The economy under siege</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The year that has just closed its accounts has left behind memories, 
mostly, of despair and gloom and a few achievements and upturns in the 
country's economic performance. On the negative side it was marked by 
spasms of turmoil in the capital market, continued stagnation in 
manufacturing, imposition of heavy taxation, exorbitant increases in 
charges of utilities, and sharp fluctuations in exports (a respectable 
increase in the first half and a sharp decline in the second). Added 
to this long list were the devaluation of the rupee, frequent strikes 
and suspension of economic activity, unabated double digit inflation, 
etc. The heaviest battering the economy took was from planted rumours 
(demonetisation, financial bankruptcy) military coup, etc.) which, 
along with strikes, played havoc with it. The sponsors of these had 
aimed at just that and largely succeeded in achieving their objective 
of scaring away foreign and domestic investment and providing big push 
to prices.

On the positive side, agriculture sector appears to have turned the 
corner and infrastructure, after long neglect, is receiving attention 
and investment. Budget deficit came down from 8 per cent of GDP to 5.5 
per cent, though not yet within the safe limit. Revenue collection 
registered some improvement while the State Bank partially succeeded 
in   imposing financial discipline and started operating a 
comprehensive market mechanism to ensure monetary stability. The basic 
maladies of the economy, inherently strong and resilient, are rooted 
in the inflexibility of the revenues and expenditure of the federal 
and provincial governments and lack of will on the part of the 
political leadership to evolve an appropriate corrective strategy. 
These maladies are not new. Their symptoms began to appear when during 
the early '80s current expenditure began to be financed by loans and 
development, outlays declined as a proportion of total government 
declined government spending. It is now 20 per cent against 40 per 
cent in the late 70. As a part of current and entire development 
expenditure having been financed, over a period of a decade and a 
half, from loans, debt servicing amounted to a very high proportion of 
total revenues. In 1994-95 debt servicing and defence together 
consumed close to 90 per cent of the total revenues; in 1996-97 
revenue collection may fall far short of the requirements even for 
these two heads.

Budget deficit for 1994-95, though reduced as a proportion of GDP, 
exceeded the target by 1.5 per credit. The trend showed signs of 
accelerating during the first half of fiscal 1995-96. This deficit is 
the root cause of most of the economic ills. It limits government's 
policy options; reduces financial resources for development, in both 
the private and public sectors; disturbs monetary stability; 
accelerates inflationary pressures; intensifies mal-distribution of 
income; strengthens the renter class; and leads to a decline in 
exports, creating dis-equilibrium in the balance of payments; and 
prepares the ground for devaluation. The year 1995 saw all these 
things happening as a result of the failure to achieve the target of 
budget deficit. The government followed the established pattern of 
raising taxes to reduce deficit, thereby increasing the burden of the 
urban classes.

Despite the proddings of the IMF and the World Bank whose writs 
otherwise run unchallenged, successive governments have failed over 
the years to raise water rates, levy tax on farm incomes or recover 
the nominal tax that has been imposed on agricultural assets. For 
promotion of a tax culture, fair play and equity are essential. 
Because of the absence of these, a sort of resistance, as distinct 
from evasion, to payment of taxes is developing. Before this grows 
into a movement, the rulers must eliminate discriminatory laws and 
practices and base the taxation system on fairness and the universally 
accepted principle of equal income equal tax.

During the earlier part of the year, government-business relations 
remained very tense, leading to protest strikes, a phenomenon unheard 
of in business world. In the latter half, the relations between the 
two slightly improved as a result of various packages of concessions 
and incentives, especially for the spinners. The government's 
proposals for reforming the structure of trade bodies has drawn a 
positive response from a large body of businessmen. Cordiality between 
the PPP government and the big business could not be restored, 
however, because of the government's insistence on the recovery of 
defaulted loans, raising of equity-debt ratio and absence of easy 
availability of loans from financial institutions. Until recently most 
industrialists had largely relied on soft loans, made available 
liberally; most of them were never paid back. Defaulted loans which 
amounted to Rs 80 billion two years ago are now said to have crossed 
the Rs 100 billion mark despite accelerated recoveries. It is because 
of these factors and also the high rate of interest (resulting from 
the reduced credit pool because large resource locked up in non-
performing loans) that large-scale manufacturing remained stagnant. 
The year 1996 is expected to stimulate economic recovery. 

The hope emanates from the upswing in the agriculture sector which 
contributes a quarter of the GNP, provides employment to half the 
labour force and transmits life blood into other sectors. All the 
major cropswheat, rice, cotton and sugarcanehave done well. Minor 
crops have not done badly either. Cotton would lift both manufacturing 
and exports and, as a consequence, other sectors as well. Capital 
market is already showing signs of recovery. If law and order improves 
and confrontationist politics does not target the economy for its 
onslaughts as it did last year, the rest of the macro-economic 
indicators should look up. On its part, the government needs to remove 
the impression of drift and indecision and problems should be attended 
to as soon as they arise.

Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Jan 2: Conflicting answers have been offered by Pakistan 
International Airlines and Civil Aviation Authority to the Federal 
Anti Corruption Committees (FACC) query regarding the operation of a 
mysterious charter flight to India from Pakistan in June last. 	
   
The FACC, headed by Sen Malik Mohammad Qasim, inquired about this 
particular charter flight to India after reading press reports that 
wives of top bureaucrats flew in New Delhi for shopping on which 
50,000 dollars were reported to have been spent.
     
The PIA informed the FACC of a chartered flight on June 6. It was 
operated from Islamabad to New Delhi and was flown back to Lahore. 
   
It was chartered by National Power, Karachi for Keith Henry, the 
firms chief executive from UK, and his team, Saeed Khan of PIA 
informed the FACC on Dec. 12. 	
   
However, before getting this reply from the PIA, the FACC was informed 
by the CAA on Dec. 6: We have found out one non-scheduled extra 
section of F-27 flight PK 2721/2722 operated on Islamabad-New Delhi- 
Lahore sector on 06 June 1995. On its return from New Delhi on the 
same date, it landed at Lahore. 	An extra section operated by the 
PIA does not fall into the category of charter flight, Zahid Raza, 
GM, air transport, informed Ali Ashraf Khan, a member of the FACC, in 
his official letter on Dec. 6. 	
   
While acknowledging the receipt of the letter and taking exception to 
the inaccuracy of the information, the FACC in a strongly worded 
communication to the PIA managing director, told him that the answer 
is sufficiently misleading, perhaps deliberately couched as such with 
certain reasons unknown to us. 	
   
The FACC pointed out the inaccuracy between the replies offered by the 
PIA and Civil Aviation and has demanded a copy of the passengers 
manifest showing the names of passengers who travelled on both sectors 
on this flight.

on various charges.
    
British Home Secretary Michael Howard is arriving in Islamabad on Jan 
7 and we will discuss with him how to extradite MQM leader Altaf 
Hussain despite the fact that Pakistan does not have an extradition 
treaty with England, Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar said.
    
He told Dawn on Wednesday that the extradition of Mr Hussain from 
London would be one of the main issues to be discussed with the 
British home secretary during his three-day stay.
    
Pakistan had earlier requested Interpol to apprehend the MQM chief and 
extradite him. However, nothing came out of that move.

Meet Sabz and Zaitooni.
Theyve been around for 180 million and would like to stay.

Can they?
Its up to you


Pakistan harbours 2 of the 7 species of turtles found in the world 
today.

For 180 million years, Sabz (Green Turtle) and Zaitooni (Olive Ridley 
Turtle) have come to Karachis beaches to lay their eggs. Sadly today 
Sabz and Zaitooni are in danger. Soon they may be extinct. Unless you 
help.

Once the eggs are laid, Sabz and Zaitooni returns to the sea. The eggs 
although camouflaged in a nest hole are threatened by predators; Every 
year fewer and fewer eggs  hatch. If this continues, none of Sabz and 
Zaitoonis eggs will hatch and they will disappear forever.

Are you going to allow this to happen?

Sabz and Zaitooni are a vital balancing link in our ecological system. 
They have brought colour and variety to our beaches. They are one of 
the most ancient vertebrate life forms in the world and play an 
important role in our understanding of nature.

Once Sabz and Zaitooni go they will never come back! 

To save Sabz and Zaitooni, more enclosures to protect their eggs have 
to be built and maintained. But we cannot manage alone.

We need your help to ensure that Sabz and Zaitooni stay.

So its up to you.

Please join us in saying ........ 

SABZ AND ZAITOONI,  PLEASE STAY

Facts on the Marine Turtles of Pakistan
Two species of marine turtles nest on Karachis beaches at Hawkesbay 
and Sandspit; the Green Turtle (Sabz Kachwa) and Olive Ridley 
(Zaitooni Ridley Kachwa).

The Green Turtle (Sabz Kachwa):
* Latin name: Chelonia Mydas
* Adult shell length: 90-110 cms
* Adult weight: 280-300 Ibs
* Food: Seaweed
* Nesting areas: Tropical & subtropical beaches around the world
* Interesting Fact: They are the only vegetarian species among marine 
turtles. It takes 12 to 15 years before they reach adulthood and 
return to nest. They have the highest commercial value for food among 
all sea turtles.

The Olive Ridley Turtle (Zaitooni Ridley Kachwa):
* Latin Name: Lepidochelys Olivacea
* Adult shell length: 70-75 cms
* Adult weight: 100-150 Ibs
* Food: molluscs
* Nesting areas: Costa Rica, India, Mexico and Pakistan
* Interesting Fact: The rarest and smallest among marine turtles.

How do turtles make a nest and by their eggs?
Coming ashore at night the female turtle digs a 3 feet deep hole with 
her powerful flippers. Once fixed in this depression she lays an 
average of 100 eggs. After laying the eggs she covers the hole with 
sand using both her front and rear flippers and then return to the 
sea.

What happens after the eggs hatch?
The eggs usually hatch after 40 to 60 days due to the heat from the 
sun and0 the chemical composition of the sand. Once they hatch they 
are attached to the brightest spot over the sea. If there are 
artificial lights the hatchlings are easily disoriented. They may then 
run inland and suffer exhaustion, desiccation, death by predators or 
accidents by vehicles on the road.

Why do Turtles Cry?
Turtles appear to shed tears when they come ashore to lay their eggs. 
In fact they are excreting excess salt from their bodies to maintain 
their physiological salt balance.

Why are Turtles disappearing from our Shores ?
All marine turtles species are in danger of extinction due to the 
following reasons:
- Commercial trade for turtle skins shells medicines and cosmetics.
- Destruction of the eggs by predators and poachers
- Accidental capture of turtles in fishing nets.
- Extensive shore-line development human disturbances and pollution.

Why Protect our Turtles ?
Turtles are known as the last of the worlds living dinosaurs. They 
first appeared on earth between 150 and 200 million years ago during 
the Triassic period. Their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Now 
if through negligence and greed we allow these magnificent animals to 
become extinct we will lose one of the most ancient vertebrate life 
forms in our world today.

<a name="fina">Financial crisis looms in PTVC </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Jan 1: The financial viability of Pakistan Television 
Corporation (PTVC), one of governments oldest commercial 
organisations, has lately become highly uncertain as expenditures have 
begun outstripping its income of around Rs. 1.50 billion annually.
    
Overheads, overstaffing, medical expenses, staff loans, bonuses, ex-
gratia payments, house rent advances and uncalled for secretariat 
allowances etc are said to be the main factors upsetting PTVs budget 
which is burdened with an annual salary bill of Rs. 500 million for 
6000 staff. There are 700 more posts lying vacant in the Corporation 
because of the governmental ban on recruitment.
    
In 1993 the revenue income was around Rs.700 million which went upto 
Rs.1.50 billion in 1995, but meanwhile expenses rocketed up due mainly 
to an uncalled for sudden jump in the perks and take home salaries of 
the staff and also because of mismanagement. Attempts of some of the 
past administrations and that of the present one headed by Mrs. Rana 
Sheikh to bring about a qualitative change in the programming 
including news and current affairs programmes have come to nought 
because of budgetary constraints and due also to the chronic dearth of 
talent at the senior levels where the real creative work is carried 
out and programmes conceived.
    
Until the advent of Lt. General (retd.) Mujibur Rehman in the PTVC in 
late 1970s, promotions in the Corporation used to be accorded on the 
basis of merit and seniority, but the General-turned-Information 
Secretary made seniority the sole criteria for going up the ladder 
which reportedly killed initiative, devotion and creativity and 
promoted sycophancy, indifference and pedestrianism.
    
Talented young staffers awaiting promotion are said to have taken up 
assignments outside the Corporation to satisfy their creative 
impulses, earning in the process additional incomes while the 
untalented are ruling the roost at the helm purely on the basis of 
seniority.
    
Because of in-house dearth of creative talent, the Corporation is said 
to have started buying programmes from outside which is reported to 
have added further to its financial difficulties. Previously, outside 
producers used to buy time from the PTV at a hefty fees to telecast 
their programmes, financing the entire deal by enlisting the support 
of private sponsors and advertisers.
    
The increase in broadcast time by 100 per cent in the meanwhile and 
the competition since in the shape of NTM are also said to have 
affected PTVs income and expenditure. More so, because the government 
in the meantime has also stopped providing the Corporation financial 
help for running the boosters and stations set up for socio-economic 
reasons in non-revenue regions.
    
However, financially doubtful decisions at important junctures and 
overstaffing are said to have, in the main, made the Corporation as 
economically unviable as the PIA has now become,  and if immediate 
corrective steps are not taken, to make it leaner and meaner, the PTV 
is soon likely to join the Pakistan Railways on the shelf of perpetual 
losers, fear independent financial analysts.

<a name="bill">Billions lost due to perpetual delay</a>

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 28: A public sector cement project, conceived as a BMR 
investment with a completion period of three years, has taken more 
than seven years to be commissioned with a cost overrun of nearly Rs 3 
billion.
    
My in-depth investigation reveals a pathetic case of mis-management, 
and lack of appreciation for the cost implication vis-a-vis timeliness 
of project execution.
    
Surprisingly, the time delays have occurred despite the frequent 
supervision by the World Bank team and large supervisory inputs from 
the outside consultants for which the corporation paid an amount of Rs 
342 million.
    
A cause of the additional cost burden is said to be owing to the 
denomination of the loan financing in a currency (German mark) which 
has been appreciating against the dollar.
    
Such irresponsible use of public resources by responsible officials 
with clout is said to be the main reason for the recurring budgetary 
deficits, as bureaucrats with the right  connections are known to get 
the finance ministry to approve of the most unreasonable expenditures 
without much difficulty.
    
Also, the entire period of seven years during which Rs 3 billion were 
added to a Rs 2 billion cement project was one of heightened political 
turmoil in the country, making it possible for the officials 
responsible to escape accountability.
    
That is why bureaucracy relishes political turmoils and where there 
is none, it creates made-to-order crisis so as to carry on its 
business unhindered, explained a former bureaucrat who claims to know 
his class inside out.

<a name="thec">The critical setback to industry</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed

In a country where the manufacturing sector has to be given top 
priority to reduce the massive unemployment, accelerate the sluggish 
economic growth, and increase the exports, 1995 has been a 
disappointing year.   Some have attributed the very low growth in the 
manufacturing sector in 1994-95 to the shortfall in cotton production 
and its high prices, but that is only a part of 'the explanation. The 
larger part of the setback was due to a combination of negative 
factors in which official policies played the decisive role.

The manufacturing sector grew by 4.41 percent in 1994-95 against 5.39 
percent in the preceding year, but the setback to the large scale 
sector was even greater as it expanded by only 2.69 per cent against 
4.14 per cent during the preceding two years. The situation was saved 
by the small scale industrial sector which grew by 8.4 per cent as in 
the preceding year despite the small financial assistance and other 
help it received from official quarters as it lacks. political clout 
and is not well organised to exert the right pressure on the 
government.

Even in the area of sugar production which had a record output the 
industry faced serious problems as it was not permitted to export its 
surplus at a time of peak world prices and the decision to permit 
exports currency slowly and only partially for fear of shortages at 
home pushing up prices and destabilising the government politically. 
Simultaneously the government reduced the tax relief to the industry 
and tried to force the mills to sell sugar at arbitrarily low prices 
at home by arresting a few of their owners and seizing some of their 
stocks, particularly in the Punjab.

As a result of negative fiscal policies following the move to collect 
Rs 45.5 billion more as taxes in 1994-95 principally from industry, 
many industries recorded negative growth, including a fall in the 
making of motor cycles of 20.3 per cent bicycles of 15.3 percent and 
motor tyres and tubes of 5.2 per cent, paper and board industries of 
4.9 percent, jute goods 11.4 percent, cigarettes of 3 percent and 
fertilisers of 0.3 percent after a growth of 21 percent the year 
before. Compared to that the cotton yarn output increased by 3 percent 
and cotton cloth by 7.8 percent showing the poor performance of the 
principal industry of Pakistan which had to import cotton at high 
prices.

Figures for the industrial performance in the second half of 1995 are 
not available. But Mr V.A. Jafarey, adviser to the Prime Minister on 
finance, said recently that while the target for industrial growth for 
the current year is 6 percent which means its climbing down from the 
earlier fixed 6.8 per cent. He said that apart from the cotton 
textiles, there has been an increase in all other industries: motor 
cycle output has grown by 1.7 per cent, State Cement production by 9 
percent and soda ash by 11 percent cigarette making too has increased 
substantially. But what matters is not a marginal increase in 
manufacturing growth but substantial growth to fulfil the target of 
6.8 percent which itself is very low by all standards compared to the 
growth of 8 percent recorded in 1991-92.

It is a reflection of the poor performance in the industrial sector 
that brochure on two years of peoples government 1993-95 - 
achievement and performance published by the government does not 
contain a chapter on industrial performance nor does it make any 
specific mention of industry.

What is too disappointing is the industry is recording a poor rate of 
growth despite the fact that 34 per cent of all imports is machinery 
and five percent more of that is import of raw materials for making 
machinery. Import of non-electrical machinery in 1994-95 rose to Rs 30 
billion from Rs 25.4 billion the year before, and the same pattern 
continues now as the rise in the imports during the first five months 
of the current year too has been attributed to increase in import of 
machinery.

But while the import of machinery goes on rising straining the foreign 
exchange resources of the government critically, 3,500 industrial 
units in the country are reported to be sick with its critical impact 
on industrial output. A committee of the Federation of Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry, which has been examining the issue now say it 
has finalised suggestions for revival of, or assistance to, about 367 
units. And following the directive of the State Bank of Pakistan 
repayment of loans of some of these units have been re-scheduled.

So clearly, what matters is not how much-more of machinery is imported 
year after year but how well that is used and how much of that goes 
into real value added production and exports? There are six major 
reasons why industries have been faring badly in recent times.  

1. Industry has been forced to bear the brunt of taxation by the 
federal and provincial governments while agriculture is exempt from 
income tax and trade and service sector as a whole is taxed very 
lightly even which the consumers have to pay high charges. Industries 
have been hit hard by the additional revenues of Rs 45.5 billion 
sought to be collected last year which eventually failed dismally.

2. What upset the industrialists was not only the high and varied 
taxation, including turn-over tax, but also the rigorous or arbitrary 
manner in which that was sought to be collected, with fear as the 
principal instrument. Arrests of industrialists and confiscation or 
seizure of their assets became common, and that demoralised the 
industrialists.

3. Industrialists were also forced to pay back the loans on which they 
had defaulted for long and they were not prepared for that, or not 
willing, and to make matters far worse the interest rates shot' up and 
following the removal of the cap on the maximum interest rate the rate 
rose to 25 percent. And rising interest rates remained the continuing 
factor.

4. The crisis in the stock exchanges where the index of  the last 22 
months added to their problems and they found it difficult to raise 
money from the public, and banks offered too little loans on their 
shares after their prices had crashed, particularly in the vast 
textile sector.

5. As taxes on production went up and along with cost or production 
through the rise in the cost of power, POL and gas, smuggling into the 
country increased in a big way, and competed successfully with many 
Pakistani manufactures.

6. Exports did not increase last year in quantitative terms as much as 
prices which accounted for the 18 percent rise in export earnings 
which were offset by the 16.7 percent rise in imports. Of course, the 
lasting violence and destabilisation in Karachi, and the opposition, 
and at times between the government and industrialists made major 
contribution to industrial stagnation.

The sustained inflation at 13 percent or even more reduced the demand 
for goods at home at high prices and smuggling met the demand 
partially at lower prices. Now that the cotton output has risen to 
about 10 million bales the industrial picture, particularly in the 
textile front, should improve, but there is the lasting tussle between 
the cotton lobby and the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, which 
the government has not been able to resolve. And the textile 
industrialists demand for a separate textile ministry has been opposed 
by the growers.

The need of the times is for the industrialists to become more 
enlightened, far sighted and realistic in the post uraguay round the 
world with its increasing intense global competition in exports. And 
they have also to improve the quality of their products by conforming 
to the European Unions ISO 900 standards. And they have to make more 
of the value added and export more instead of exporting cheap products 
which invite anti-dumping penalties. All that would demand radical 
departures from the policies pursued by many of them, and improving 
their performance with their banks and the minority share holders, 
instead of being accused on all fronts.

And the government has to enter into a real compact with industry on a 
long term basis, remove the varied bottle-necks to rapid industrial 
growth and ensure a minimum manufacturing growth of 10 percent for the 
next 10 years, which means agriculture, too, has to be developed and  
modernised to play a major supportive role gainfully for itself.

KARACHI, Dec. 31: The Income Tax Corporate Region has identified 
shipping as a potential revenue earning area and an exercise is 
underway to ensure that time-chartered ships are duly taxed.
    
The official who declined to be quoted said the IT Corporate Region

had been operating through their time-chartered vessels without paying 
taxes on them.
    
He said voyage-chartered vessels will continue to operate without 
paying taxes and added that the vessels of such countries that have 
bilateral shipping agreements with Pakistan will also continue to 
enjoy tax exemptions.
    
It was also mentioned that the IT department and the Central Board of 
Revenue (CBR) can easily track down such agencies. It should not be 
difficult for the CBR to ascertain whether a shipping agency conducts 
only such functions that are declared in its registration documents or 
trespasses them.

KARACHI, Jan 1: A loss of Rs 434.374 million was declared by the 
Chairman, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation at the 17th Annual 
General Body meeting of the corporation.
    
The PNSC chief informed the shareholders that the fluctuation in the 
charter market was the cause of the losses. He said that the situation 
further aggravated due to heavy depreciation of Pak rupee against US 
dollar and Japanese yen through which most of our overseas payments 
are effected.
    
He said that over 135 per cent increase in bulk cargo lifting was 
mainly to securing of entire iron ore affreightment contract from 
Pakistan Steel. Compared to 0.161 million tons in 1993-94, PNSC 
carried 1.450 million tons of iron ore during 1994-95.
    
Simultaneously the wheat lifting during the year under review 
increased to 1.478 million tons from 0.670 million tons during 1993-
94. The bulk cargo was lifted on chartered vessels as at present PNSC 
does not own any bulk carrier.

<a name="sena">Senate panel report on privatisation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, Jan 2: The Senate opposed the sale of state-run United Bank 
Limited (UBL) to a foreign investor, asked the government not to sell 
Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation in a haste and use 
privatisation proceeds for debt retirement.
    
The privatisation of UBL should be deferred till the broader issue of 
selling majority shares in our financial institutions to foreign 
buyers has been decided, a report of the Senate Standing Committee on 
Finance said.
    
The report said that the two companies  Faysal Islamic Bank of 
Bahrain and Saudi Basharatul Group  short-listed by the Privatisation 
Commission for the sale of 26 per cent shares of the PTC to a 
strategic investor were foreign companies.
    
The Senate Committee report said that the sale of UBL, with more than 
1,600 branches in Pakistan and 25 highly profitable branches abroad, 
would be a serious departure of Pakistans policy of allowing only 
restricted activity to foreign banks.

It pointed out that even during Uruguay Round of trade talks, the 
developing countries had put up a stiff resistance to demands for 
opening their services sector to foreigners, notably banks and 
insurance companies.
    
The committee also asked the government for holding an independent 
assessment about the credibility and propriety of the buyers 
interested in purchasing the UBL by an impartial committee headed by 
the Governor of the State Bank.

The report said the sale of the UBL was being pushed without carrying 
independent valuation of the banks assets and liabilities. Valuation 
is the first important step in the process of privatisation in order 
to obtain a benchmark price below which the enterprise should not be 
sold.

It said the committee was of the considered opinion that in the 
interest of transparency as well as the delicate nature of banking, an 
independent committee headed by State Bank Governor be constituted for 
valuation purposes. 
   
PRIVATISATION OF PTCL: The committee has also opposed the sale of 26 
per cent shares of PTCL to a strategic investor at less than the price 
at which 10 per cent shares of the organisation were sold earlier in 
1994.
    
The government had sold 10 per cent of PTCL shares at Rs 55 per share 
in 1994. 
   
The report said the present prices of the PTCL shares at the countrys 
three bourses were almost half  Rs 27 per share  than the price at 
which these shares were sold earlier.
    
If another 26 per cent shares are offered in the present depressed 
state of the market to one of the strategic investors, the country 
would receive only one-third or even one-fourth of the real value of 
the most precious national asset.
    
It said at the present market price, the PTCL would hardly fetch 1.2 
billion dollars, which would be equal to 14 months earnings of the 
PTCL.
    
But an official of the Privatisation Commission, when contacted to 
comment on this issue, said the fears of the committee were unfounded. 
He said the investors would be offering the price not considering the 
present market conditions but their long-term financial interests, 
particularly when they would also be taking over the control of the 
organisation.
    
The report also asked for formulating adequate regulatory mechanism so 
that the bidders would have a clear view of the rules they had to 
follow.
    
The government on Monday appointed two regulatory bodies for PTCL but 
Committee chairman Prof Khursheed said these bodies have yet to frame 
the rules.
    
The committee recommends that the privatisation of PTC should be 
deferred until the relevant law for regulatory mechanism has been 
approved by the Parliament, the report said adding: Also 26 per cent 
shares should be sold to a strategic investor at this stage only of 
the price offered is reasonably above the price at which 10 per cent 
shares were sold along with the transfer of management.
    
It said that if such a price could not be realised then the 
privatisation of the PTC should be deferred till conditions of the 
countrys stock market improve.
    
MISUSE OF PRIVATISATION PROCEEDS: The Senate committee termed the sale 
of 13 industrial units by the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party as a loss 
to the national exchequer.
    
It said unlike past, when the liabilities were also transferred, only 
assets were transferred in the sale of 13 units. These units were sold 
at a total price of Rs 864 million whereas the liabilities which were 
written off and the money paid by the government in golden hand shake 
stood at 1.36 billion. The sale of these units thus involved a net 
loss of 506 million rupees to the state, the report said.
    
The committee also opposed the government for using proceeds from the 
privatisation funds. He said out of Rs 34.5 billion earned so far 
through the privatisation, the government has already spent Rs 10 
billion on development projects under PDSP and SAP, extended loan of 
Rs 3.0 billion to WAPDA and earmarked another Rs 6.0 billion for 
development projects and paid debts to the tune of Rs 6.0 billion. 
Only Rs 6.0 billion has so far been utilised for debt retirement, 
the report said.
    
These resources must not be utilised for budgetary support and 
deficit financing... there is a consensus that these funds should be 
utilised entirely for retiring the countrys debt rather than current 
expenditures.
    
The report said the total debts were to the tune of 32.0 billion 
dollars  24.0 billion dollars foreign debt and the remaining internal 
debts. This is a very serious situation and we have asked the 
government to stop budgetary support from this fund. Only 10 per 
cent of the privatisation proceeds should be utilised for 
development.

<a name="imfo">IMF official named : Special Secretary to finance ministry</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Jan 3: The government has decided to appoint Mr Mikal Aziz 
as a Special Secretary to the ministry of finance, to help overcome 
economic problems including inflation and budget deficit.
    
Mr Mikal Aziz is the son of late Foreign Minister Aziz Ahmad and is 
currently serving as one of the Senior Executives of the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), in Washington.
    
Sources said he is likely to accept the PPP government s offer to 
virtually head the ministry of finance and take corrective measures 
for improving the economic situation of the country.
    
Sources said that one of the reasons to appoint Mr Mikal Aziz was to 
further cultivate better financial relations with the major donor 
agencies, specially the World bank and the IMF.
    
Although the World bank has increased its annual assistance level from 
$700 million to $1 billion and the IMF providing uninterrupted tranche 
from the ESAF programme of $1.5 billion, the government wanted 
additional foreign resources.
    
The prime minister is particularly interested to see substantial 
increase in the foreign exchange reserves.
    
Mr Mikal Aziz had earlier served as the Chief Economist in the 
Planning Commission as well as the head of the World bank and IMF 
division in the Commission.

<a name="larg">Larger decline averted on stock market</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 2: Stocks remained in a bearish frame of mind as heavy 
toll in city violence inhibited large technical buying from any 
quarter.

But a near spate of new issues during the first fortnight of the new 
year, offering shares worth about Rs 700 million to the general public 
after last years relative quiet tells a different story.
    
The market resistance to further decline was led by the current 
favourites, notably PTC vouchers and Hub-Power, which were again 
massively traded.
    
But fresh decline in some of the MNCs, notably Lever Brothers, Ciba-
Giegy, Shell, PSO, ICI Pakistan, Brooke Bond, Reckitt and Colman and 
PSO worried investors as their performance could have negative impact 
on the others despite the fact that Engro Chemicals, Siemens Pakistan 
and Wellcome Pakistan managed to finish with good gains. Philips, 
which fell Rs 7 was the leading losers.
    
Some of the local blue chips also followed their lead and fell 
modestly under the lead of Adamjee Insurance, D.G.Khan Cement, 
Kohinoor Power, Quice Foods and Mustehkam Cement were leading among 
the losers.
    
However, all was not bad with the broader market as a good number of 
leading shares and second-liners managed to end with good gains under 
14th ICP, Century Paper, Kashmir Edibles, 6th ICP, Crescent Bank and 
Wellcome Pakistan, which rose by Rs 1.70 to Rs 5.
    
Other notable gainers were led by KASB, 9th ICP, and Bata Pakistan, 
although gains were modest.
    
Bulk of the support remained centred around the five current 
favourites, notably Hub-Power, PTC vouchers, Dewan Salman, Faysal Bank 
and ICI Pakistan, which together accounted for 90 per cent of the 
total volume.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 25 paisa on 5.777 
million shares, Hub-Power, higher 35 paisa on 5.775 million shares, 
ICI Pakistan, off Rs 1.10 on 823,700 shares, Faysal Bank, off Rs 1.10 
on 686,000 shares, Lucky Cement, easy five paisa on 296,000 shares, 
Maple Leaf Cement, up 50 paisa on 217,000 shares, Honda Atlas Cars, 
lower 10 paisa on 143,500 shares and Dewan Salman off 25 paisa on 
1.036 million shares. There were some other notable deals also.
    
Trading volume rose to 19.603 million shares from the overnight 16.248 
million shares thanks to active short-covering at the lower levels.  
There were 317 actives, out of which 181 shares fell, while 72 rose, 
with 64 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="stoc">Stock market ends on subdued note</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 28: Stocks market closed on a subdued note as investors 
took profits at the higher levels.
    
The Karachi Stock exchange index of share prices, however, could not 
sustain the resistance level of well over 1,500 points and breached it 
by an extremely narrow margin, reflecting that a section of operators 
was not inclined to close the year beyond this level.
    
Fateh Textiles, Dewan Textiles and Nakhshbandi Textiles were some of 
the big gainers in this sector. Among the investment shares, first 
four ICP mutual funds, Askari Leasing, Capital Security, and some 
others were good gainers and so were Dewan Salman in the synthetics 
,which attracted fresh heavy buying at the lower levels and aided 
mainly a good cash dividend and bonus shares.
    
Cement and energy shares fell fractionally on selling at the higher 
levels and so did auto shares.
    
But chemical and pharmaceutical shares were actively traded and mostly 
on the higher side, leading gainers among them being Colgate, Hoechst 
Pakistan, Reckitt and Colman, Sitara Chemicals and Engro Chemicals, 
rising by one rupee to Rs 4.50.
    
Nestle Milkpak and Quice Foods were notable gainers in the food 
sector, but other sections showed modest decline.
    
Leading losers were led by Gadoon Textiles, Quality Steel, BOC 
Pakistan, and Packages, which suffered fall ranging from Rs 4 to 10. 
Telecard, which has been ruling steady around Rs 100 for the last 
several sessions, also fell by Rs 10 and so did National Fibre 
followed by Ciba-Geigy, Cherat Cement, Elite Modaraba, Al-Faysal Bank, 
and Sui Northern.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, lower 20 paisa on 8.461 
million shares followed by PTC vouchers, steady five paisa on 5.601 
million shares, Dewan Salman, higher Rs 1.10 on 1.730 million shares, 
Lucky Cement, lower five paisa on 690,000 shares, Faysal Bank, off 05 
paisa on 502,500 shares, ICI Pakistan, ICI Pakistan, easy five paisa 
on 608,800 shares, and Askari Bank, off Rs 1.65 on 239,000 shares.

<a name="ksei">KSE index of share prices gains 38 points</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Muhammad Aslam

Stocks closed the last week of the fading year on a stead note as 
strong institutional support aided partly by a good bit of speculative 
and year end buying pushed prices of most of the leading shares 
substantially higher from the bottom levels.

The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices rose by 39 points at 
1,499.28 as compared to 1,460.88 a week earlier, reflecting the 
strength of the base shares and other blue chips.

"Over the year the market lost Rs. 80 billion in the total market 
capitalisation and the KSE 100 share index shed 600 points, although-
it recovered at the fag end of the year to 1,550 points after hitting 
the bottom at 1,322 point at one stage", analysts said.

"The market has lost about Rs. 80 billion in the protracted bearish 
spell spread over almost the entire year and needs a correction",.

Dividend announcements both from Dewan Salmam at 20 percent cash and 
an identical amount of bonus shares and seven percent cash by TriStar 
Modaraba were in line with the market expectations owing to a bad year 
and were well received.

But an omission by First Habib Modaraba was disappointing and has its 
toll. After consolidating its post-record dividend (320 percent), BOC 
Pakistan resumed its upward drive as the management and some order 
investors reappeared in the rings to grab the floating stock. There 
were sellers as 800 shares were traded and in the process it rose by 
another Rs. 70 to Rs. 550 its peak level so far.

National Asset Leasing, Lease Pakistan, Standard Chartered, Union and 
Trust Leasing were notable gainers among them. In the bank sector, 
Citicorp, Crescent Bank MCB, Al-Faysal and Javed Omer and some others 
were leading gainers.

Leading insurance and textile shares also came in for active 
shortcovering and generally ended partially recovered under the lead 
of Dadabhoy, ALICO, University and Insurance. Leading gainers in the 
textile sector were led by Gadoon, Regent Textiles, Kohinoor Textiles 
and Nishat Mills.

Barring Dewan Salman, which was massively traded after the news of 20 
percent cash dividend and 20 percent bonus, synthetic shares were 
generally neglected including Dhan Fibre and Pak Synthetics for want 
of support. 

Cement shares came in for stray support and extended the previous 
gains and so did energy shares, major gainers among them being Chrate, 
Dadabhoy and D.G. Khan cement.

Among the energy shares, PSO, Mari Gas Nishat Tek and some other rose, 
while Haroon Oils, and Sui Southern fell modestly on selling at the 
higher levels.

Leading MNCs played on both sides of the fence amid active rolling of 
positions from one counter to the other.

While Siemens Pakistan, Enrgo Chemicals, Glaxo Lab; Lever Brothers, 
Pakistan Elektron, and Al-Ghazi Tractors rose sharply, Shell, Ciba-
Geigy, Parke-Davis, Pakistan Gum Hoechst Pakistan, Nestle milk pak and 
Wellcome Pakistan suffered modest pruning on late selling.

Trading volume soared to 78 million shares. The volume leaders were 
again led by Hub Power, which was massively traded in each session 
amid alternate bouts of buying and selling, finally ending with a net 
modest gain on large volume. It was followed by PTC vouchers, Dewan 
Salman, Faysal Bank, and the newly turned active, ICI Pakistan on 
heavy buying at the current lower levels. Lucky Cement, Dhan Fibre, 
25th ICP Mutual Funds, Bank of Punjab, Honda Atlas, Fauji Fertiliser, 
Askari Bank and some others.

KARACHI, Dec. 31: The Karachi Stock Exchange is expected to introduce 
its recomposed 100-share index from Jan 15, after adding six new 
companies to the list and deleting as many.

months and adds and deletes largest stocks in the list to make the 
100-share index truly reflective of the financial health of the stock 
market.
    
The six companies, which have been added to the list under the 
capitalisation rules are as under: Siemens Pakistan Engineering Co, 
Sandoz Pakistan, Faysal Bank, Century Paper, Security Paper, Ibrahim

KARACHI, Dec. 31: Volume on the Karachi Stock Exchange soared to well 
over 26 million shares as investors moved in to cover positions at the 
last session of year amid active two-way trading.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices after opening well 
below the 1,500-point barrier, fell on late selling to close with a 
fractional fall of 2.97 points at 1,497 as compared to 1,500.73 at the

MNCs, notably Glaxo Lab and Philips, which posted gains ranging from 
Rs 11.25 to 26, followed by Quality Steel, rising by Rs 7. Other

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 1: The stock market opened the new year account on a 
bearish note as investors sold in haste on news of fresh killings in 
the city.
    
The KSE 100-share index fell 1.83 per cent or 27.04 points at 
1,470.04, wiping out the market capitalisation of Rs 5.6 billion just 
in one go at Rs 322.184 billion.
    
Minus signs dominated the list under the lead of Glaxo, which ended 
with a trimmed gain of Sunday, falling Rs 20 amid active selling. 
Other big losers were led by Lever Brothers, Philips, and Packages, 
falling by Rs 5 to 8. Dewan Salman, which has been in strong demand 
after the announcement of dividend last week also came in for active 
selling and was marked down by Rs 3.85 on heavy selling.  Other 
prominent losers were led by leading shares such as Pilcorp, Al-Faysal 
Bank, Bankers Equity, Crescent Bank, Cherat Cement, Adamjee Insurance, 
Engro Chemicals, and Cherat Paper, which fell by Rs 1.40 to 3.

Some of the leading shares came in for selective support and managed 
to finish modestly higher under the lead of Trust Leasing, Prudential 
Bank, Fazal Textiles, National Fibre, Sui Northern, Hoechst Pakistan, 
Quice Foods and Pak General Insurance, rising by one rupee to Rs 4.50, 
biggest gain being in the last company.

<a name="corr">Corruption</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee

ON AUGUST 11, 1947, three days prior to the birth of Pakistan, 
Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the Father of the Nation, addressed the 
Constituent Assembly of Pakistan: "... the first duty of a government 
is to maintain law and order ... The second thing ... one of the 
biggest curses from which India is suffering ... is bribery and 
corruption. That really is a poison. We must put that down with an 
iron hand and I hope you will take adequate measures as soon as it is 
possible for this assembly to do so." I write this three days after 
the nation celebrated his birthday "with the usual fervour," a 
birthday which this secular man of liberal thought decreed be 
celebrated with that of Jesus of Nazareth so that the Christians of 
Pakistan would for ever, together with most of the rest of the world, 
have a holiday on December 25.

This Father bequeathed to us a house in which to peacefully live and 
prosper. Within twenty-four years, the house split, we were left with 
half. Now, forty-eight years down the road, the remaining half is 
tottering, crumbling but instead of concentrating on propping it up, 
we still hold symposium, seminars, debates, and argue why he built and 
left us a house.

One of the last priceless pieces of the family silver, United Bank, 
stolen by the government in 1974 in the name of the people, is now on 
the block, and in order to appraise this distress sale one must look 
at how the nationalised Muslim Commercial Bank and the smaller Allied 
Bank were privatised and sold.

What our corrupt governments do is to first decide to whom the cake is 
to be given, and it is then suitably baked. In the case of MCB, 
Tawwakul was the highest bidder for the controlling shares at Rs 56 
per share, followed by Adamjees, then Crescent. Mansha came in fourth 
at Rs 43.49. Lower still was Saeed. Nawaz wanted Mansha to have the 
bank, so his government manoeuvred a bid raise for Mansha to match the 
highest, and he was given control. Adamjee, Crescent and Saeed backed 
out. Abdul Qadir Tawwakul fought for his rights. He petitioned the 
court, wherein he filed an affidavit from which I quote: "Let it be 
stated that in his (finance minister Sartaj Aziz's) office (and with 
him were the governor, SBP, and chairman, PBC, and with me were 
Sirajul Haque, a senior advocate and his two other colleagues who will 
vouch the veracity) ... the petitioners were bullied and threatened 
with dire consequences if they challenged the government decision." 
(SHC, CP 60/91, Abdul Qadir Tawwakal and Others vs The federation of 
Pakistan & Another). The Tawwakuls were subsequently harassed and 
chased by the 'hounds' and faded out of the picture. The impresario 
who stage-managed Mansha's performance was banker Hussain Lawai, 
formerly of the United Bank of the Middle East and the Faysal Islamic 
Bank, who was appointed to manage the MCB after its control was vested 
in Mansha.

Enter Benazir for the second time. Impresario Lawai fell in with the 
new production team and things were made so hot for Mansha that he 
exiled himself to the tundras, where he remains. Lawai continues to 
work loyally for  the leadership.

Benazir has been instructed by the IMF to get on with the UBL 
privatisation, with which the government has been fiddling for the 
past two years. The Privatisation Commission (PC), headed by Naveed 
Qamar (who has been known to appoint the same legal advisers and 
experts to advise the PC as employed by the bidders) was ordered to 
ensure 'transparency' and 'accountability' in the sale.

The statement of qualification (SOQ) was issued. The PC's avowed 
intent on accountability and transparency can be gauged from: (1) the 
note it appended to 'Basis for Disqualification': "Commission can 
reject any SOQ without assigning any reason whatsoever", and (2) the 
note appended to the 'Eligibility Criteria': "The Privatisation 
Commission reserves the right to reject any bid without assigning any 
reason whatsoever."

Eight applied: Foreigners A1-Faysal Bank of Bahrain and Basharahill 
Group of Saudi Arabia, and the home-grown Global Group, Dewan Crescent 
Unigem, Lahore Motors, Asset Investment Bank, and Haji Saifullah 
Bangash. All six Pakistani groups have been disqualified for one 
reason or another.

The Marketing Memorandum (MM) was issued by the PC, describing what is 
on the block. Our born-again Abedi, Hussain Lawai, backed by the 
government, again came into play. UBL is a fine bank. The significant 
sales pitch printed in the MM tells us that:

* "UBL is a large commercial bank with approximately 20 per cent 
market share ranking it second in Pakistan which is a large country by 
any measure, and is an exciting market in which to operate."

* "The State Bank in its capacity as the owner and regulatory body 
will provide adequate support to the management... State Bank is a 
majority shareholder (94 per cent), government institutions hold the 
remaining 6 per cent."

* "The government which is committed to the principles of equity and 
transparency has adopted a two stage process for the sale ... the 
bidders will be pre-qualified... the bidders must submit their SOQ by 
November 12,1995 ... pre qualifying bidders will be invited for due 
diligence and for subsequent submission of price bids ... the 
government expects to award the contract by end December 1995." (the 
bidding has since been extended to Jan 7).

* "Pakistan is the world's ninth most populous country with GDP 
increasing on average by over 6.4 per cent over the last ten years ... 
Deposits for the banking sector have grown at an average of over 18 
per cent for the last five years... The banks have been very 
profitable with returns on equity shown in excess of 50 per cent .... 
The issue of banking licences is tightly controlled. It is very 
difficult to obtain a licence... UBL has no such restrictions in terms 
of geographical coverage ... UBL represents a good entry point to the 
banking sector in Pakistan."

* "UBL has investments and subsidiaries throughout the Middle East, 
UK, USA and Switzerland. The prevalent regulatory regimes operating 
and the difficulty of obtaining licences in many of these countries 
has made these assets of significant strategic value."

To lighten our burden as we ring in the New Year, I recite my 
discussion with a yuppie economist trained at Yale who has returned to 
serve his country as a financial expert, a security expert, currency 
trader, stockbroker, etc, etc. After projecting a dismal analysis of 
our economy, he said, "Magar, kuch ho jayaga. When I asked, "Keya 
hoga?" he replied, "Allah bachaiga." My retort "Allah ke darbar me 
insaaf hai?'' "Bilkul, bilkul. Wahan nahin, to kahan?" 

My only reaction to this was that Allah would punish us. He gave us a 
country, with plains and forests, with rivers and enough flowing water 
to generate all the electric power needed and much more (for which we 
successfully negotiated the Indus Water Treaty), a long cyclone-free 
coastline, a good climate, millions of resourceful people, etc.

 In toto, a viable country. But what have we done with it? The Yale 
yuppie's answer was that Allah is merciful and beneficent and raising 
his eyes heavenward, he proclaimed that we have no cause to plead, 
that we can only file a mercy petition before Him.

<a name="1995">1995, a year of hope and despair</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dilawar Hussain

For the investors in Pakistan stocks, the year 1995 provided, endless 
opportunities for both hope and despair. Although, the market tried 
everything from plausible to the absurd, nothing it seemed, could stop 
the rampage of the bears that first began in March last year. Up until 
the last week of '95, the KSE index of 100 shares had already dipped 
to 1462 points, reflecting 30 per cent slide from 2059 in the 
beginning of the year and a whole 45 per cent plunge from the peak of 
2661 touched in March '94. Market capitalisation which stood at 
Rs,400.517 billion at the dawn of '95 had dwindled to Rs 325.698 
billion by December 24, representing 19 per cent drop over the year 
and loss of nearly Rs 80 billion of the market cap.

"Interest rate hike in developed economies, collapse of Mexican 
currency and the scarce liquidity caused by numerous mega issues 
including PTC, Hubco, Dhan and Faysal Bank" were identified by various 
experts to be some of the factors that fuelled the bearish fire.

The month of November proved to be the worst when the KSE lost 4 per 
cent of the market cap or Rs 12 billion in the span of just about a 
dozen trading sessions.

In desperation, the stock market managers sent SOS to Islamabad. The 
response was unexpectedly quick and the government assured the market 
of all possible help. As the principal strain was identified as 
liquidity crunch, the government agreed to release Rs 80.0 million to 
ICP, NIT and SLIC, being their share in the proceeds of the privatised 
units. The money would be channelled into the market, by these major 
institutional players. Though the government deferred decision over 
the exemption of bonus issues from taxation, till the next budget, it 
permitted provident, pension and EOBI funds to be invested in the 
equity market, subject to certain conditions, all for the protection 
of investors' interest.

While the secondary market in shares remained shrouded in uncertainty, 
the new offerings in primary market were, by and large; well 
received. Nearly three of every four new issue of shares at the KSE 
during 1995, were oversubscribed. 

During the current year to end November, the capital market managed to 
mobilise an aggregate sum of Rs 26.8 billion through new listings, 
right and bonus issues, debt instruments and debt/equity swaps. Even 
as the figure fell short of the record Rs 34.7 billion that the market 
mobilised in '94, the previous year enjoyed the unusual benefit of 
such mega issues as PTC vouchers, Hub Power Company and Dhan Fibre.

In all 40 offerings of shares in the primary market were made until 
end-November this year (68 in '94). While these companies seeking 
listing at the KSE, offered Rs 4.9 billion worth of shares to the 
general public, they received an aggregate sum of Rs 16.2 billion.

Another possible indication of continuing investors' interest in 
equities was the huge volume of business. Trading volume soared to 
2.710 billion shares during the January-November 1995 as against 1.684 
billion shares in the corresponding eleven months of the previous 
year. New trading record was set on June 13 when the volume of 
business hit an incredible 46.405 million shares. Average daily 
turnover during the year increased to 13.287 million shares from 7.833 
million shares in 1994. 

No one denies that going by fundamentals, the Pakistan equities offer 
the best value for money. Battered by the 20-month long bear rampage, 
the market price of listed shares has fallen from average of Rs 64 in 
March '94 to Rs 24 currently. Not all, but a large number of blue chip 
scrips are trading at incredible single digit multiples.

For 1996, the international fund managers may reallocate sum of around 
$ 14 to 20 billion for investment in emerging market equities. Many 
managers of local brokerage houses admit that the markets in Hong Kong 
and Singapore and possibly India may be able to wrest a larger share, 
but save for the few discouraging factors, the Pakistani bourses are 
well ahead of our immediate competitors: Malaysia, Indonesia and 
Philippines. Two main hurdles that deter foreign investors are 
identified by some stock strategists as the fear of further 
devaluation of the Pak Rupee in the first quarter of next year and the 
uncertainty about the state of health of the economy and Government's 
liquidity.

<a name="theh">The hunter and the hunted</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mazdak

OSCAR WILDE once described the sport of fox-hunting as the 
unspeakable hunting the uneatable. And while it is true that 
partridges can be quite tasty, at two lakhs apiece, ones palate has 
to be pretty jaded not to gay while wolfing down bhuna hua teetar.  
   
Of late, the papers have been full of presidential shikars and their 
costs, with newspapers diligently estimating the cost per bird, with 
some cost accountants working it out at Rs 215,000 for each partridge. 
I know these are inflationary days, but even so, this seems excessive. 
Now considering the firestorm of criticism the Presidents hunting 
trips provoke, one would have thought that he would not make them such 
public affairs. If he cant do without decimating the wildlife in the 
areas he visits, why cant these shoots be made smaller and more 
discrete?
    
We are told by his media people that much of the costs involved are to 
do with improving the infrastructure of the areas the presidential 
hunting parties traverse. If roads have to be laid in the middle of 
nowhere, who benefits apart from the contractors concerned? In any 
case, one of the points about hunting is that you should be prepared 
to rough it out. 
   
Indeed, dedicated shikaris tramp for hours over all kinds of terrain 
and are lucky to get a few shots at game. There is something decadent 
about driving around in air-conditioned jeeps with beaters flushing 
out birds for you to pot at your leisure. In fact, this is the 
preferred hunting style of some of our foreign guests who annually 
play havoc with many endangered species in Pakistan with the 
governments connivance.
    
For years now, successive governments have been exhorting us to 
conserve the environment. However, politicians and bureaucrats have 
simultaneously and wantonly been butchering wildlife, feeling 
themselves to be above the law. And since no action is ever taken 
against them for flaunting the bag limits or hunting out of season or 
in restricted areas, it seems they are quite right in their 
assumption. For those of our leaders who cant shoot straight, 
partridges and sundry other birds are netted. And not only do they 
brazenly break the law themselves, they issue permits to visitors from 
some neighbouring countries to hunt the houbara bustard to extinction. 
   
Then we have the obscene stories of hundreds of migratory birds 
slaughtered to feed starving guests at feudal weddings. While all this 
mayhem is going on, the officials and ministers of various wildlife 
and environmental departments not only remain silent spectators, but 
join in the slaughter with great gusto on the principle of if you 
cant lick them, join them.
    
Urging us to care for our environment while raping it is on the same 
moral plane of exhorting us to pay our taxes without shelling out a 
penny themselves, and our leaders are adept at both pastimes. This is 
all on a par with the double standards of those who control our 
destiny: they routinely remind us of Islamic values while robbing us 
blind.
    
In this day and age, what is the attraction of hunting? Shikari 
friends rave on about their love for the outdoors, the thrill of the 
chase and the excitement of blasting game out of the sky. It is true 
that there is the atavistic hunting instinct buried deep in most of 
us, but surely we have come a long way from the days when our 
forefathers hunted for survival. 
   
I stopped shooting long ago, but confess to enjoy accompanying friends 
on shikar occasionally. In my defence, let me say we walk considerable 
distances over rugged countryside, and rarely see very much game, no 
doubt the result of persistent over-hunting.
    
There is something magnificent about seeing wild ducks on the wing on 
a cold winter morning or the startled look in the eyes of an untamed 
beast in the wilderness. I last went on a safari to Kenya three years 
ago, and even after poaching has severely depleted East African herds, 
the savanna still seethed with wildlife: lions, elephants, rhino and 
several kinds of deer were plentiful in the Serengeti. While 
captivated by the sight of the spectacle, I was reminded of how we had 
virtually annihilated all of our wild animals.
    
So even when we know that we have driven our wildlife to the edge of 
extinction, why do so many people still insist on hunting? If they 
want to prove they are good shots, they can do at a target range or 
compete in clay pigeon shooting. Certainly they cant be wanting to 
test their courage because it doesnt take much to be chauffeured 
around the countryside, taking pot shots at birds flushed out by 
beaters. And if they just want to eat partridges, they can easily be 
bred in captivity. Obviously, some macho thing is at work here, with 
men wishing to prove themselves in a pre-historic ritual. The entire 
gun fetish has been the subject of many learned papers written by 
psychologists who see the gun as an extension of the male.
    
When I go on this rant with shikari friends, they attempt to silence 
me by reminding me that I dont mind joining them in eating the 
partridges and the ducks they have shot. But this implies that just 
because I eat meat, I should slaughter animals myself. While I accept 
that every living thing must die, I draw a line at hastening this 
death personally. OK, so perhaps I am splitting hairs, but I refuse to 
become party to the death of any living creature that is not 
threatening me.  If our remaining wildlife is to survive, it is clear 
that our conservation laws will have to be strictly enforced. But when 
the highest in the land themselves flout these laws, how can the poor 
game wardens function? However, this is true for much else that is 
wrong with this country: when our rulers consider themselves to be 
above the law, there is no chance that the rule of law can be imposed.

<a name="emin">l995: eminently forgettable</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

SOME years are memorable; others are best forgotten. 1995 falls in the 
second category. While it certainly added more than its share to the 
national sum of cynicism and despair, it provided less grounds for 
detecting any silver lining in the mass of its unrelieved greyness. 
Some problems have become permanent features of the Pakistani 
landscape. So there is not much point in crying over them. Corruption 
of all kinds, are now reaching the highest peaks of authority, is a 
phenomenon to which most Pakistanis are resigned. As they are to the 
fact that politics has become another name for the promotion of self-
interest. The administrative system in all its facets is becoming more 
corrupt and inefficient by the day. Civic services are declining. 
About the state of law and order, the less said the better. The 
education system is in a shambles and becoming more of a disaster as 
time passes, with no government, vehement protestations to the 
contrary notwithstanding, being really pushed about to arrest its 
steep decline. Health care, as and when needed, is a concept to which 
most Pakistanis are alien. These are problems, however, which have 
come to be accepted as part of the natural order of things. The usual 
response to them, therefore, is a resigned shrug of the shoulders. 
Equally pointless is the lament about the nation lacking a sense of 
direction. If the nation has not been sure of its destination for the 
last two decades, no single year is going to make up this deficiency.

The year that has just come to a close, however, made more immediate 
contributions to the nation's dismal state of affairs. These came in 
the form of skyrocketing inflation, an aggravation of the Karachi 
situation and the realisation - that should have come sooner but from 
which there can be no further escaping - that the nation is living 
beyond its means, the revenue that it earns not being enough even for 
its current expenditure. The resource crunch that this reflects is 
affecting all sectors of the economy. Not that the government was 
ready to admit as much. Throughout the year, even when there was a run 
on foreign exchange accounts and the Karachi stock exchange plummeted 
to its lowest level for a long time, it kept insisting that the 
economy had been put on the right path, a claim that people battered 
by inflation and the falling value of the rupee had a hard time 
believing.

Karachi for its part retained its capacity of keeping the country as a 
whole in a state of depression. The stand-off between the government 
and the MQM continued with neither side showing any willingness, let 
alone any ability, to moderate its stubbornness or recognise the 
limitations of short-sightedness. The government's approach to the 
problems of Karachi was best symbolised by the oft-repeated insistence 
of the interior minister, General Babar, that the back of terrorism 
had been broken - a claim cruelly mocked by the continuing violence to 
which Karachi remained a prey throughout the year. Nor was any light 
forthcoming about how this imbroglio could be resolved, with the 
government matching the terrorism that it had to face with high-handed 
tactics of its own and with the sputtering negotiations between the 
two sides running into the sand.

In the political arena outside Karachi the only sounds that 
predominated were those of ceaseless wrangling, both the ruling PPP 
and the opposition PML(N) accusing each other of a variety of sins and 
refusing to enter into any dialogue that could help impart a measure 
of civility to the expression of their differences. Not to be outdone 
by anything else, throughout the year both houses of Parliament 
remained avenues for the exchange of acid and vitriol, with the 
favourite method of legislation continuing to be the issuance of 
presidential ordinances. While the government may have spent little 
time in worthwhile or useful governing, it could at least claim that 
it had strengthened its grip on power by removing Manzoor Wattoo and 
installing a more pliable figure as chief minister of Punjab, thereby 
belying the opposition's hopes, fervently expressed almost 
incessantly, that it would soon be shown the door. How this wish could 
be translated into fact, the opposition, a bit chastened by the non-
success of its anti-government agitation in 1994, was not in a 
position to explain.

On the foreign policy front there was no end to the government's self-
congratulation when the Brown amendment, which allows a one-time 
supply of arms (minus the F-16s) for which Pakistan has already paid, 
was passed by the American Congress. In other respects, however, there 
was not much room for happiness in the external field. Relations with 
the Rabbani government in Afghanistan took a turn for the worse, with 
the Pakistan embassy in Kabul being sacked by what clearly seemed like 
an officially-encouraged mob. When a bomb blast sent shock waves 
through Peshawar later in the year, the suspicion was strong in 
Pakistan that the Rabbani government may have had something to do with 
it. Relations with Iran were also not of the best, with both countries 
trading suspicions if not actual accusations about what each was 
doing, or which particular faction each was supporting, in 
Afghanistan. As for relations with India, they remained in their 
customary freeze with no initiative from either side to bring about a 
thaw in this situation.

For two separate reasons the army remained in the glare of public 
attention in the last quarter of the year. The first came in the form 
of the attempted coup whose masterminds were accused of planning to 
eliminate the high command of the army preparatory to seizing power 
and installing an Islamic regime in the country. The second was rooted 
in the search for the next head of the army, a question that generated 
a great deal of speculation because of the delay in naming a successor 
to General Waheed but one that was resolved satisfactorily in the end 
when the choice fell on the man next to him in seniority: General 
Jehangir Karamat.

The one positive thing that could be detected in the national scene 
lay in the realisation that despite the twin scourges of corruption 
and mal-administration, democracy had survived another trouble-ridden 
year and the system, much as it is, had not broken down. Indeed, the 
din of its firebrand rhetoric notwithstanding, the slower pace of the 
PML(N)'s mobilisation campaign seemed to betray the recognition that 
the government was not about to go in a hurry. But despite this one 
sliver of positiveness which contained within it the hope that in 
spite of its other troubles, Pakistan might be on the verge of putting 
its history of chronic instability behind it, there was no mistaking 
the growing doubts being expressed in different quarters about the 
ability of the political class to master the country's problems.

A decade ago Pakistanis used to moan that what they lacked was a 
system and the regularity of elections. Now having had these things 
and their problems not having abated a jot, they have come round 
slowly to the view that, while they have a system, there is something 
wrong with the people working it. Their yearning, therefore, is for 
honest leadership, an expectation souring into further bitterness 
because as they look around and scan the horizon, they probably 
realise that it is not going to be anytime soon that this expectation 
is likely to be fulfilled.

<a name="kara">Karachi and its trials</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M.H. Askari

FOR Karachi, the year 1995 ended much the same way as it began  with 
virtually no signs of normality and calm returning to the city, not in 
the foreseeable future. Karachiites may have become more or less used 
to it, but the sight of the checkposts and bunkers at road-crossings, 
armoured personnel carriers, commonly mistaken for tanks, parked at 
street corners and members of the law enforcement agencies patrolling 
the streets with deadly looking weapons held at alert, still terrify 
the casual visitor.
    
The intervening twelve months accounted for about 2000 deaths by 
violence, most of them leaving no trace of those guilty of the crime. 
Senseless attacks by militants, riding in cars or on motorcycles and 
on people crowding the shopping establishments or the roadside tea-
stalls have been quite a common occurrence. There have also been 
innumerable reports of factional fights, revenge killings and what are 
officially described as police encounters. the violence is having an 
almost dehumanising effect on the people.
    
A vast segment of the citys population, ironically in no way 
responsible for the street violence or for random attacks on shops and 
houses, is forced to live in an almost constant state of terror. 
Localities which in the past never went to sleep are now plunged in 
semi-darkness and enveloped in an eerie silence soon after sunset. It 
is anybodys guess whether the administration, which has the 
responsibility for law and order, can actually fathom the depth of 
fear and anxiety which families in middle class housing areas and 
kachi abadis must suffer when their young sons or other male kin do 
not return home at the end of the day. Not infrequently, the missing 
persons are to be found in thanas and their release is secured at some 
cost to ones self-respect and resources.
    
There is no indication how much longer the intensive law enforcement 
drive, which is now in its fourth year, would continue. The 
authorities should be aware that it has not contributed much to 
restoring the peoples confidence in the administration and its 
capacity to provide them with a sense of security. On the contrary, it 
is largely seen as a source of harassment. There have been innumerable 
accounts of excesses committed in the course of the siege-and-search 
operations in localities which are regarded as the strongholds of the 
lawless elements. Since large numbers of those serving with the law 
enforcement agencies have been recruited from areas quite remote from 
Karachi, they are generally regarded as outsiders. There can be hardly 
any social or family pressures upon them to treat the common people 
with compassion or to build a relationship of trust with them. The 
sense of alienation between the people and the law enforcement 
agencies has only deepened in the recent years. The situation is 
widely perceived in terms of we and they and this undermines the 
effective working of the administration.
    
There have been attempts at building bridges. The chief minister of 
Sindh, Syed Abdullah Shah, constituted a committee to advise him on 
his governments handling of the Karachi situation. But it has had 
only a marginal effect on the overall situation.
    
Not unexpectedly, the opposition has been attempting to use the 
Karachi situation to secure a foothold in Sindh and Mr Nawaz Sharifs 
move to convene an all-parties conference on Karachi on December 25 
in Islamabad was in essence a part of this strategy. Mr Sharifs 
demand for the dismissal of the present chief minister of Sindh and 
his replacement by a neutral chief minister was an over-simplified 
response to an extremely complex situation. In any case, it was while 
he was the prime minister that the Operation Clean-up was launched 
resulting in the present travails of Karachi.
    
There can be no substitute for a meaningful dialogue between the MQM 
and the PPP and it is clear that the talks between the MQM and the 
ruling party, led by Mr Ajmal Dehlavi and Mr N.D. Khan, have become 
altogether stalemated. In any case, the desultory and casual manner in 
which the talks were conducted hardly ever made them look credible. 
Almost every round of talks was followed by accusations and counter-
accusations by the two sides. The hope that the level of the talks may 
be raised was generated by reports of a meeting between Mr Ajmal 
Dehlavi and the prime minister, carried by a section of the media. 
However, the reports have been firmly denied by the prime ministers 
secretariat even though Mr Dehlavi continues to maintain that the 
meeting did take place. His sudden departure for London has now given 
rise to speculation that he may be carrying with him some specific 
proposals with regard to further negotiations concerning the Karachi 
situation.
    
It is clear that there can be no progress in the PPP-MQM contacts 
without the involvement of Mr Altaf Hussain and, howsoever unpalatable 
it may seem to be for the government, there can be no way out of the 
present cul de sac without his blessings. For the Mohajirs it is by no 
means an enviable situation that their future should be hostage to the 
will of a single person, sitting a long distance away from Karachi. 
But this is how the situation has come to be.
    
There is also no denying that sections of Mohajirs who, to begin with, 
found nothing in common with Mr Altaf Hussains political ideology now 
frankly identify themselves with the MQM. While it may be embarrassing 
for the government to initiate direct talks with the MQMs self-exiled 
chief, some means need to be discovered to soften the ground and 
secure Mr Altaf Hussains tacit agreement to certain ground rules.
    
In principle, no sane person should object to the pre-condition that a 
resort to arms should be altogether ruled out in any political 
process. However in the case of MQM, there has to be a reasonable 
assurance that what it presently perceives as its persecution would 
also be given up as and when it is asked to give up arms. How such 
trust can be established after all that has happened in the past two 
or three years is not easy to determine. Perhaps, if the government 
could decide upon a deadline for the withdrawal of the paramilitary 
force, it could help to ease some of the pressures which the people of 
Karachi are presently experiencing.
    
At the same time, some serious consideration could be given to the 
MQMs demand for amnesty (at least interim amnesty) for Mr Altaf 
Hussain and some of the partys other senior leaders now under 
detention. Such amnesty could be linked to the condition for a firm 
commitment to the commencement of a serious dialogue and a time-limit 
for the conclusion of such a dialogue.
    
Perhaps, to begin with, the government could set up a judicial or 
quasi-judicial committee for a preliminary scrutiny of the various 
charges against the MQM leaders. Such a committee, to command the 
confidence of both sides, will need to include non-partisan people of 
unquestioned integrity.
    
It would be unrealistic to suggest that once the scrutiny has taken 
place, charges of a serious nature, with adequate prima face evidence, 
should be dropped. However, those accused of such charges should be 
held in judicial custody until the disposal of their cases and not be 
left in the custody of the law enforcement agencies. That there would 
be serious difficulties in the way of establishing the proposed ground 
rules goes without saying. However, a modicum of mutual trust has to 
prevail, perhaps through the intercession of a neutral third party, if 
there is an earnest desire on all sides to pull Karachi out of its 
present quagmire.

Editorial Column

THE freezing of assets worth Rs 4.3 billion belonging to 21 notorious 
drug barons highlights the magnitude of the narcotics problem facing 
the country. The action once again confirms the fact that it is 
largely the big fish that are behind the insidious spread of the 
menace over the years. Vast fortunes have been accumulated by them 
through the illicit drug trade. As in the case of drug lord Haji Sakhi 
Dost Jan, the estimated value of frozen assets is around Rs 70 
million. Since the offender is a sitting MPA of the Balochistan 
Assembly, it also underlines a nexus between politics and drug trade, 
which had long been suspected and even established in the past. Those 
whose assets have been frozen by the Anti-Narcotics Force include some 
of the most wanted figures in connection with drug related offences - 
Haji Ayub Afridi for one. Forfeiture of his property has already been 
ordered by a Peshawar court.  

Action against these drug barons relates to the period 1994-95. Since 
efforts are under way to get orders from competent courts to freeze 
assets of other drug lords, it is evident that many big fish are still 
at large. Unless they are tracked down and brought to justice, there 
can be little improvement in eliminating the drug problem. Freezing of 
assets as part of punishment for proven offenders can act as a 
deterrent against organised trafficking.  

With links to international drug-crime syndicates and operating under 
different covers and guises, drug barons with powerful connections 
pose a difficult problem of arrest and prosecution. This is where the 
will 
and commitment of the government to the total eradication of the drug 
menace will be on test.  

Narcotics have pervaded all levels of society in varying degrees, the 
worst hit being the youth who are falling prey to the poison in 
increasing numbers. The problem is most tellingly illustrated by the 
rising crime graph in the country. Nearly two million people across 
the country are hooked on drugs, a million of them addicted to heroin 
alone, outstripping the capacity of the country's drug rehabilitation 
programmes. The problem will become even more acute if stiff measures 
are not taken now to curb production and supply of narcotics and 
punish traffickers and pushers engaged in this deadly business. 
Unsparing action against these anti-social elements is essential. At 
the same time, the agencies responsible for tracking down the culprits 
must also make a thorough and honest job of the responsibilities 
assigned to them. If there are serious lapses stemming from shady 
deals which accounted for failures in the past, the drive against 
heroin and other drugs will not prove much of a success. </pre>

Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 28: Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has said that he would 
personally see the fitness of Javed Miandad in the One-day National 
Championship before he makes a decision about the master batsmans 
inclusion in the World Cup party.
    
Akram said as a captain, he would like to play with the best possible 
strength and Javed Miandads experience and talent are invaluable. 
But Javed (Miandad) has not played cricket for the past two years. He 
has to play in all the One-day Cup matches and has to prove his 
fitness.
    
Akram was, however, of the view that besides a training camp, there 
was a need of three one-day games. The two teams can be made within 
the 20 probables announced and these matches can be for charity or 
flood relief.

<a name="batt">Pakistan batter Kenya 7-0; tournament rescheduled</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 29: Pakistan youth prevailed over lowly rated Kenya 
rather unimpressively in the 7-0 scoreline including the first hat 
trick of the contest by Muhammad Usman who converted three penalty 
corners while Belgium pulled a 2-1 win against Italy in the two 
matches held on the second day of the 7up World Youth Hockey Festival 
at Army Hockey Stadium, Rawalpindi.
    
In a reshuffling of its kind in a world competition, Malaysia was 
shifted from pool-A to pool-B in place of India and its opening match 
with Kenya was stated as null and void. It has been quite a situation 
here with Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) hanging on desperately to 
make India participate in the tournament being  allotted to Pakistan 
by International Hockey Federation (FIH) on experimental basis. The 
efforts were well placed but has remained unsuccessful after a 
recent agreement between the two counterpart federations to resume 
hockey clashes.

According to information available, Indians had some visa problems. 
We cannot wait more than two days, secretary PHF Lt. Col. Muddassar 
Asghar said when asked about the outcome of the negotiations.
    
Interestingly, PHF press release on behalf  of  the  two tournament 
directors C.Hernandez and W.Doyer stated that due to the fact that 
India is definitely not coming to the tournament, in order to have two 
equal pools of five nations in this invitational hockey  festival, the 
 Malaysian team  has been transferred to pool B. The match schedule 
 has been adjusted according to this decision.

About picking Malaysia, TD Carlos Hernandez stated that  they wanted 
to have an Asian team replace an Asian team. The change means Pakistan 
after playing easy games in their pool will be getting a tough semi-
finals, while Holland is expected to have a easy pre-final.

In the two pool-A matches played, yesterday, Pakistan recorded a 7-0 
triumph over underdogs Kenya. Although, the winning margin is  big but 
the team failed to click through out the game. Kenya played all hands 
up right from the start and their defensive mood irritated hosts from 
displaying class hockey to the holiday crowd.

For Pakistan, Muhammad Usman stole the limelight by converting three 
penalty corners in the first session to record the first hat trick of 
the tournament. Usman set the pace by slamming home on the very first 
penalty corner in the 2nd minute of the game. Later, he charged in 
with back to back conversion on 7th and 8th penalty corner in the 25th 
and 26th minutes. On three occasions the Pakistan right flank 
harmonised but they relied more on securing penalty corners than 
warming up to produce something spectacular. The short Kenyan 
custodian was instrumental in bringing off some incredible saves. At 
half time Pakistan  was leading 3-0.
    
Pakistan  found the going rather extra easy in the second session 
as the under trained opponents had no steam to put a valiant fight 
against the hosts. Pakistan added four more, two on penalty corners 
off Waseem and Ali Raza after Waseem converted a penalty stroke in the 
48th minute. The only field goal of the game came from right half 
Irfan Yousuf, who connected a back pass from schemer Ejaz in the 58th 
minute. Left  winger Babar and inside right Ejaz were unlucky on two 
occasions when their solo efforts landed short of target.

In the second half twice umpire Write blew on Ali Razas lifted shot 
that although landed on  the board after deflection but was given 
foul. However, the umpire is the best judge to see whether the 
projected shot was to land over the 18 inch board but the Pakistani 
bench thought both to have been goals. Pakistan took 19 penalty 
corners in all. Teams: Pakistan: Muhammad Qasim, Ali Raza, Tariq 
Imran, Irfan Yousuf, Muhammad Saqlain, Waseem Ahmed, Zakarullah, Ejaz 
Imran, Muhammad Farooq, Muhammad Khalid (capt), Aamir Mehmood, 
Iftikhar Ahmed, Muhammad Usman, Imran Yousuf, Rana Atif, Babar 
Abdullah. Kenya: Samuel Ochiening Owiur, Kanyi Cyrus, Wilson

Singh (capt), Narinderpal Singh Mankoo, Firoz  Bashir Sultan, Amit 
Pyaralal, Rashpal Singh Virdee, Sandeep Singh, Wycliff Otieno Dola, 
Steven Mbugwa Miracho, Eric Irungu, Bassam Abdul Karim.
    
Earlier, Belgium overpowered Italy 2-1 to console their opening day 0-
9 humiliation by hot favourites Pakistan. Renaod Fayt, put Belgium 
ahead in the 2nd minute of the game with an indirect try into the 
cage. After tasting blood, they stepped up the tempo to double the 
lead however Italian rebutted the challenge. Italy after settling in, 
initiated dangerous inroads and capitalising on a fine lay off on the 
right Pieter Theuniers sounded the equaliser in the 13th minute. Both 
teams relied heavily on the rolling substitution rule and the bench 
management remained busy replacing the players frequently.
    
In the last moments of the first session Belgium mid fielder S. 
Schroeyens banged home to finish 2-1 at half  time. After resumption 
Italy had one solid chance of getting par again with a penalty stroke 
in the 45th minute but Mauro Zedda failed to  push the ball past the 
keeper. 

Belgium: Stephane Moraux, Thilbault Collin, Laurent Bollon Perin, 
Pieter Theuniers, Nicolas Renaer, Jeremy Zembsch, Sebastien 
Schroneyens, Jonathan Delguste, Patarics Cierts, Alexander Letier, 
Jean Bruno, Kevin Kielbaey, Renaud Fayt (capt), Jean Francois, Tanguy 
Deswaef.

Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 31: Two down Belgium rallied to a 6-3 win over Russia, 
Malaysia succumbed 0-2 to Japan in a match dominated by them, five 
goals from  spearhead Jiskoot, second hattrick of the contest, Holland 
cruised to a 6-0 easy victory over Mexico, while Italy recorded  their 
first triumph with a 3-0 success against Kenya  here in four matches 
played in the World Youth Hockey Festival at Rawalpindi and Wah.

In the first match of pool-A, Belgium recovered from an early shock of 
trailing by two goals within seven minutes into the game by finishing 
the first session at par 2-2. Russian mid-fielder Alexie Mikheev put 
his team ahead by converting the first penalty corner with a sizzling 
drive past keeper Deswaef in the 4th minute.

The lead contributed to further dislodge the Belgium defence who in an 
attempt to save dangerous move by a Russian strikers, faulted inside 
the striking zone to get penalised for a penalty stroke. Alexie sent 
the ball high in the right corner of net to make it 2-0.
    
Belgium struck slowly tried to revamp its tactics first blocking off 
the Russian attacks and later pushed ahead with some knitted moves 
that drew the opponents backward. In the 22nd minute Belgium succeeded 
in reducing the margin off Nicolas Renaer who after hustling through 
the defenders drew out the keeper and sent the ball in with classical 
reserve flick. The first goal also acted as a positive stimuli for 
Belgium who went out to outclass the Russians after that. Moving with 
confidence, the Belgium strikers found yet another opening through 
substitute Kevin Kielbaey who banged home in a goalmouth melee to draw 
level 2-2 two minutes before half time.
    
Resuming in the same spirit, Belgium slammed home two goals in the 
early session of second half off Jean Collin and Kevin to sit pretty 
leading 4-2 before Russian centre-forward reduced the margin 3-4 with 
a 55th minute field goal.

But, Belgium rounded off with two more goals before finish in a 
roaring fashion to announce their sure berth in the pre-finals from 
pool-A. Belgium secured fourteen penalty corners in all against two by 
the rivals.
    
At Wah, Malaysia continued to find the going tough after being shifted 
to pool-B with a 0-2 defeat at hands of Japan, earlier South Africa 
held them to a 2-2 draw.
    
However, the worst part for Malaysia was their outright pressure on 
the opponents during the game, but as it is only the goals count and 
Japan touched home on the first two penalty corners awarded to them in 
the first 20 minutes of the match. Japanese skipper Ryouta Asari shot 
his team into lead by converting on an indirect penalty corner drill 
in the 11th minute. Nine minutes later, Junji Fudatzuji repeated the 
action to double the lead.

The manager stated that except for taking the decision in a sporting 
way there was nothing else they could have done against his team being 
shifted to pool-B after India failed to turn up. Insiders within 
Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), have stated that Pakistan Embassy 
failed to give visas to the Indian team after the Indian officials 
submitted an incomplete list for visa. It was learnt that at least two 
names were missing from the  16-member squad.

Holland outplayed Mexico 6-0 in another pool-B fixture. Centre-forward 
Friso Jiskoot stole the limelight with five classical field goals 
including a hat trick, the second in  the tournament. The spearhead 
struck the first blow in the 5th minute, added the second three 
minutes before half time. Jiskoot deflected three more after the 
breather in the 41st, 45th and 55th  minutes to complete his tally. 
The last goal was scored by right wing Mark Jong.

With this win Holland is sitting on top of the pool-B having played 
and won first two of their four games. They will take on South Africa 
and Malaysia in the next two fixtures.

In  pool-A, Italy recorded their first win of the  tournament, with a 
3-nil triumph over underdogs Kenya.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana  Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, Jan 1: Four carpeted slams by full back Ali Raza recorded 
the third hat trick in the tournament as Pakistan whacked Russia 10-0 
while in their last pool fixture Belgium registered a 3-0 triumph over 
Kenya to qualify for the pre-finals here in the two Pool-A games of 
World Youth Hockey Festival played at Army Hockey Stadium.
    
While the position in pool-A  became clear  with  Belgium grabbing the 
number two slot behind Pakistan, the tie between  South Africa and 
Holland slated at Wah  will place the Dutch ahead. However, the South 
Africa-Japan fixture on Jan 3 will decide the number two from pool-B.
    
The hosts were in aggressive mood, and  their excellent rhythm in the 
first session kept the Russians at their toes. The hot favourites 
playing their first match in the morning hours smacked the opponents 
with eight goals before the breather. The tally  was led by right full 
back Ali Raza. He sliced in three beautiful grounded shots on three 
penalty corners in the 3rd, 5th and 13th minute to record the quickest  
hat trick of the tournament. Alis blistering connections tallied 
successfully with the hit-in as he sent three piercing shots onto the 
board that completely shattered the opponents as Pakistan geared up to 
record the biggest win of the tournament so far. Ali also converted   
one more penalty corner in the second half.

Against Russia the Pakistani forward line looked in devastating form 
from the outset as they infiltrated the opponents zone at will. Led 
by Muhammad Khalid, Pakistans right and left flanks  produced 
sparkling combination moves set in the Asian style to make the inner 
trio find flowing openings to charge successfully. The workout paid 
off with Rana Atif giving final touches to two such fluent moves in 
the 30th and 32nd minutes.  

Earlier, inside left Khalid yielded two. In the 17th minute Khalid 
hopped on to a gap pass from Rana, drawing out the keeper he placed 
the ball with his left flick. Later, Khalid pushed the ball home on a 
rebound from keeper who blocked Ranas attempt in the 23rd minute. 
Khalid came close to record a hat-trick but his surging try was 
thwarted by keeper Loukine. For Pakistan left wing Babar Abdullah 
slammed home in the last minute to make it 8-0.
    
In the second session, Pakistan settled down to try out its different  
combinations, in which they switched players and also tested out Aamir 
Mehmood and Iftikhar Ahmed, besides trying Khalid on the inside right 
and making right half Waseem take the pivotal role. The experiment may 
have given the bench management an idea about the strength of their 
boys on given positions however, it failed to make the tally look 
healthier. 

Pakistan added two goals in the second half, with Rana Atif clanging 
his third in the 50th and Ali converted a penalty corner in the 55th 
to seal it 10-0.
    
In the second fixture, Belgium playing their last  pool game 
sallied to a 3-nil win against Kenya, a team which is yet to score a 
goal in the tournament. This success also placed them in the pre-
finals as number two in Pool-A.

Belgium  squandered a number of chances before striker  Renaod Fayt, 
who also the skipper, put them in front when slackness on part of 
Kenyan defence gave ample time to Renaod to push home. Belgian 
strikers remained unsuccessful to double the lead in the first half. 
Mid fielder Jean Collin scored twice in  the second session, he 
converted a penalty corner indirectly in the 51st and four minutes 
later put the ball in the cage in a goalmouth clash.

<a name="dutc">Dutch down South Africa in youth hockey</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD,  Jan 2: In a game of fast attacks, Dutch downed South 
Africa 3-1 while Malaysia shrugged off their slackness by posting a 2-
0 defeat on  Mexico here in the two Pool-B fixtures of World Youth 
Hockey Festival at Wah.
    
The Holland-South Africa tie smothered the Dutch in the  first session 
after their lead through conversion by Mark de Jose Josef Kramer in 
the 11th minute got equalised in the 17th coming from a penalty 
corner.
    
Holland after driving home on the first penalty corner in the 11th 
minute looked more aggressive. However, according to the Dutch manager 
J.V Vettorato believes that since the ball was going out after the 
attempt was saved by the keeper, a call of corner was the correct 
decision instead of penalising it for a penalty corner.
    
Although, it may be added here that the ball went high after 
touching the keeper before going out. But, more importantly striker 
Emile Smiths lethal slam powered through the Dutch defence to make 1-
1.  The decision, no doubt, shocked the Dutch strikers who set about 
to miss half a dozen scoring chances as the equaliser  from opponents 
shook up their confidence. The Dutch engaged in squandering flunked to 
take lead till breather.
    
Holland resumed to move ahead in integrated fashion. Their two vibrant 
strikers skipper Friso Jiskoot and Jeroen van der Venne struck two 
fine goals in solo accesses. Skilful Jiskoot grabbed an opportunity in 
the 49th minute charging in from the 23rd yard area he pushed home 
after beating the whole of deep defence to put Holland ahead again. 
Later, striker Jeroen striding in from the left switched towards right 
and entering the circle dodged the keeper before placing home.
    
Trailing by two goals, the agile South African defence brought off a 
spectacular save when Egbert Ho had lobbed the ball into the net. 
Holland had four penalty corners in all.
    
In the first game, Malaysia overpowered a much improved Mexico by two 
goals to nil to score their first win of the competition. 
However, even an outside chance of pre-finals qualification cannot be 
given to Malaysia against Holland, the top team of pool-B in the last 
fixture on Wednesday afternoon.
    
Malaysian forwards scrimpy attitude once inside the shooting  zone 
cost them the crucial tie against Japan, a clash they could have won 
but for the lack of fiery spirit required to deliver the goods. And 
although, they were quite affluent in making the moves but their fuss 
in striking area negate all efforts. Against Mexico, they yet again 
failed to cope with the tendency of frittering open chances. At least 
seven sure opportunities were thrown away.
    
Applying defensive tactics the Mexicans produced some brilliant saves 
that kept the opponents at bay. Malaysian right wing Abdul Razak 
Saidin broke the deadlock when he moved in on his position and slammed 
in the lead in the 27th minute. More charges from Malaysian strikers 
remained unsuccessful till the breather.
    
The tempo of the game did not change after resumption and Malaysia 
could just make one goal off fullback Gobinnathan Krishnamurthy five 
minutes before finish. Mexican strikers failed to get a single try on 
the opponents in the game.
    
Mexico after completing their tally of pool fixtures noted one 
thing in common, they equalled the most conceded goals 18 alongwith 
Russia placed in pool-A.

FIXTURE: Jan 3: Pool-A: Kenya vs Russia at 1200, Pakistan vs Italy at

<a name="tofa">Pakistan to face Japan in semis of youth hockey</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, Jan 3: Pakistan youth will run in against Japan  while 
Holland will face Belgium in the two pre-finals of the World Youth 
Hockey Festival after the  pool fixtures were completed simultaneously 
at Rawalpindi and Wah on Wednesday.
    
No matches are scheduled for Thursday. The semi-finals to  be played 
at Rawalpindi along-with the Italy-Malaysia tie and two other 
positional games at Wah has been slated for Friday.
    
Four matches were played yesterday. In pool-B, Japan came from behind 
at two down to hold South Africa 2-2 to qualify for the pre-final  and 
set a date with hosts, and Holland rolled over Malaysia 3-1 in the 
other match. In pool-A, Pakistan wrapped  up its  pool itinerary by 
nailing Italy to a 5-0 win,  while  Russia overwhelmed  underdogs of 
the competition, Kenya by two goals  to one.
    
Hot  favourites Pakistan youth continued its winning spree in the 
tournament  with a 5-0 triumph over Italy. Pakistan having complete 
command of the match failed to score a big win.  Pakistani strikers 
quite dynamic in skill  fascinated themselves in selfish acts of 
hitting the bulls-eye against the hard working Italians. The action, 
obviously, did not pay off.
    
Full back Ali Raza, opened the accounts by converting the first 
penalty corner in the 4th minute. Pakistan doubled the lead in the 
11th when right  half Waseem Ahmed pushed home on a penalty  stroke 
awarded after Italian defender obstructed with his stick. Six minutes 
before breather centre forward Muhammad Farooq slammed home third goal 
for Pakistan.
    
In the second session, seven open chances went abegging while on at 
least two occasions the two inner strikers were unlucky after the ball 
either hit that goalpost or got deflected under the keepers leg who 
had no idea where the ball had gone. In between these futile accesses, 
left full back Tariq Imran banged home a blistering shot into the 
right corner in the 53rd  minute to leave a diving custodian 
frustrated.
    
Italians in their rare combined charge managed to secure a penalty 
corner in the 63rd minute, although the shot went in but referee 
called a moving ball. Two minutes before final whistle Ali Raza 
converted the last penalty corner for Pakistan to score his seventh 
goal of the tournament.
 
In a crucial pool-B fixture, Japan came from behind trailing by two 
goals against South Africa to manage a tie and qualify for the semi-
final. South Africa who dominated the first session of the game failed 
to stop the spirited fightback of the opponents in the last ten 
minutes before breather and later in the second half. South Africa a 
more balanced side than the Japanese played on a strategy of blocking 
off the key opponents to capitalise on the opportunities that came 
their way. Forward Emile Smith struck home the opener in the 16th 
minute to put SA ahead. Seven minutes later right wing Darryn 
Gallagher scored the second from top of the circle to make it 2-0.
    
The Japanese quite shaken by the early loss, slowly rejuvenated their 
position by mounting pressure through combined moves. They succeeded 
in obtaining their first penalty corner in the 25th  minute. From 
there onwards the Japanese did not look back as powering penetration 
from both flanks they were able to reduce the margin on the fifth 
penalty corner just one minute before half time. The goal was scored 
by skipper Ryota Asari.

The Japanese picked up the tempo where they had left it in the first 
session, raiding the South African danger zone, however they failed to 
equalise on five penalty corners and at least three chances as the 
opponents struggled to keep their structure intact. SA defence quite 
vulnerable gave way when Naohiko Tobita rallied home indirectly  on 
 the eleventh penalty corner to equalise.

Holland  going  strong inflicted a 3-1 defeat over Malaysia, however, 
the latter did well to keep the first half barren. Once, the Dutch 
drew first blood in the 46th minute off their ever dependable skipper 
Friso Jiskoot in a goalmouth clash, striker Maarten Froger rolled over 
Malaysian defence on two occasions in the 51st and 55th minutes, the 
second on an indirect penalty corner. For Malaysia Veerapalan reduced 
the margin by pushing home on the second and last penalty corner for 
his team.

In the  noon pool-A match, Russia pulled up a 2-1 win over Kenya. Put 
into lead by S. Koltchugine who converted the penalty stroke in the 
10th minute, he also scored the second goal for Russia in the 44th 
minute of the game. Kenya who managed to test their skills better 
against the Russians, reduced the margin off a penalty stroke 
conversion off Singh Sohal in 45th minute. Kenya had seven penalty 
corners and one stroke while Russia had six PC and one stroke.
