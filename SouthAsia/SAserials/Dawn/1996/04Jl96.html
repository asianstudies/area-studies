ISLAMABAD, July 2: On the call of the Council for Joint Action (CJA) of the 
PNPO and the APNS no newspaper was published on Tuesday to protest against 
the imposition of general sales tax on the newspapers and the periodicals.
    
The offices of the newspapers and periodicals, however, remained open on 
Monday and Tuesday.
    
Pakistan Newspapers and Periodical Association (PNPO) and All Pakistan 
Newspaper Society (APNS) had given the call after the government remained 
adamant on the imposition of general sales tax on the newspapers and steep 
increase in sales tax and duties on the import of newsprint.
    
The CJA have already announced that if the government did not withdraw the 
unjustified imposition of general sales tax on the newspapers and steep 
increase in sales tax and duties on the import of newsprint, the newspaper 
industry can go to the extent of indefinite closure of daily newspapers.
    
The CJA has termed the imposition of general sales tax on the newspapers an 
attack on the freedom of press guaranteed under Article 19 of the 
Constitution of Pakistan.

Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, June 30: A blueprint of a South Asian Camp David accord 
between India and Pakistan, circulating in the top US congressional circles 
and think tanks for some months and considered to be the most likely course 
of action Washington may take in South Asia, envisages a new generation of 
leadership in both the countries to speed up the process.
    
The basics of what is known as the Cohen Plan have been discussed by 
leading Democratic senators with President Clinton and other top ranking US 
policymakers, an informed South Asian expert told Dawn, quietly passing on 
a copy of the plan which spreads over three pages.
    
The author of the plan is Prof. Stephen Philip Cohen of the University of 
Illinois, an informal consultant to the state department and considered to 
be a respected authority on South Asian affairs in Washington. He drafted 
the blueprint late last year and circulated it among those who had 
influence and a voice in the policy formulation processes inside the 
Beltway, an expression used for the political wheels which churn out 
policies in the US capital.
    
It is almost agreed that the plan would begin to take practical shape as 
one of the major foreign policy initiatives of the second Clinton 
presidency, after the November elections or even a Republican regime as it 
calls for a bipartisan approach, the South Asian expert said.
    
Prof. Cohen has outlined a seven-point strategy to implement what he calls 
the Camp David process for South Asia in his confidential letters sent to 
key congressional leaders. The main points of this strategy include:
    
1. It must be bipartisan. He advises Democratic senators: If you go to the 
president, you should accompany a respected Republican senator. Our 
engagement in the Middle East has been bipartisan, and has survived several 
changes in administration.
    
2. It should be seen as a long haul. Like Cambodia and South Africa, as 
well as the Middle East, it will take time. There will have to be a change 
in attitudes, although I believe that a new generation of leaders in the 
region will speed up the process.
    
3. Camp David should not come first. That is, Carters intense intervention 
took place after several years of patient diplomacy. It is important to 
have early high-visibility presidential support, perhaps a brief meeting 
between prime ministers in the White House, or at Camp David, but we are 
looking for trouble if the president (especially this president) is 
required to broker a deal. Neither side is ready yet, both think they can 
manipulate us (especially through Congress) without having to negotiate 
seriously. When they are ready to negotiate then the president might become 
involved.
    
4. We need a special emissary, someone with time, a solid reputation in 
both countries, and the ability to retain the attention of our own 
bureaucracy, and subordinate our diverse interest to the longer term goal 
of reaching an India-Pakistan detente. The state department does not seem 
able to assume this role (frankly, no one else in the bureaucracy seems to 
pay any attention to them). An emissary might best be situated in the White 
House where, however, there is little interest in South Asia except for the 
proliferation issue) or department of defence. My own candidate would be 
George Schultz, a realist with the respect of both sides and who 
understands the tasks of consensus building (he single-handedly revived the 
Middle East peace process), Mike Armacost was involved as a special 
emissary at one time, and is another possibility, and so is the father of 
the Middle East peace process, Hal Saunders, who introduced into South Asia 
some of the ideas he developed for the Middle East.
    
5. A South Asia peace process will not be expensive (except in terms of 
time). Unlike the Middle East where there has been a great deal of aid, we 
should not emphasise military assistance, but technical aid and economic 
investment. Our best argument is that a peaceful region is one where 
American investors will put their money, and that in the long run this is 
the best assurance of regional progress.
    
6. Congress can influence events positively. Congress will have to present 
a united front to both India and Pakistan, as each tries to undercut the 
other in whatever way they can. I like the idea of making aid conditional 
on progress towards regional discussions.
    
7. An American helping hand (not a foreign hand) will be welcome in India, 
despite the apparent opposition by the present Indian government. Indians 
know they are in deep trouble in Kashmir, and do not want to alienate the 
US. Thoughtful Indians also know that in the long run it is in their 
interest to co-operate with Pakistan. Their support is for a fair, 
consistent, and long-term American effort to assist the two countries so 
that they can get down to the more important task of economic development 
and social change.
    
Prof. Cohen stated in his confidential letters to congressmen: We have 
wasted five years trying to develop a coherent policy for Pakistan and 
India, but this is as good a time to start as any other. Such a policy 
should be bipartisan, have visible high-level support, take time, not 
immediately involve the president, requires a special emissary, not be 
expensive, and, I think, will be accepted by India and Pakistan.
    
Both sides see us (correctly) as policyless, except for our non-
proliferation, human rights, and (recently) economic interests, Prof. 
Cohen wrote. These are important, but there is no long-term perspective 
whatsoever. Department of defence has a good relationship with the military 
of both countries, but thats not a policy, just an opportunity.
    
South Asian experts said some of the basic prerequisites of the Cohen Plan 
had already been met which was an encouraging sign for the US policymakers. 
These include induction of a new government in India which is more 
favourably inclined for talks with Pakistan than the Rao government.
    
Signs are also visible that there may be a change of government in 
Pakistan as the Benazir Bhutto government was increasingly locked in 
confrontation with other main pillars of democracy  the judiciary, the 
parliament and the press, the expert said.
    
These experts say while any unconstitutional change in Pakistan would be 
frowned upon and be greatly unpopular in the US policymaking circles, any 
change from within the system or through the judicial or electoral process 
would not raise any eyebrows.
    
It may, in fact, be welcomed if it presented the chances of a possible 
success of the Cohen Plan in particular and the US diplomacy in South Asia 
in general.

<a name="chil">Child labour: Pakistan may lose duty free access to EU</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadaba Islam

BRUSSELS, June 30: For months, South Asia has watched uncomfortably from 
the sidelines as the European Union has stepped up its public courtship of 
East Asias leading economic powers.
    
Pakistan and India werent invited to the first Euro-Asian summit in 
Bangkok in March. Both countries are on the receiving end of the EUs 
latest moves to cut back Asias preferential trading privileges and are set 
to lose their duty-free access to EU markets for textiles in two years.
    
European trade unions and industrialists are also insisting that both Delhi 
and Islamabad should buy more European goods and take tougher action to 
curb the issue of child labour.
    
Finally, however, some good news. European Commissioner Manuel Marin has 
called for a reinforcement of the EUs political and economic ties with 
India, saying the country must receive the same VIP treatment being 
accorded to the East Asians.
    
Marin is also off to Pakistan in late July for talks on a new trade 
agreement. After months of trying, Brussels and Islamabad have finally 
agreed on a date for an encounter between the Commissioner and Pakistan 
Prime Minister.
    
All fifteen EU capitals have received a 33 page strategy paper from 
Commissioner Marin calling for a strengthened partnership with India. 
Aides to Marin say he is making a long overdue wake up call
    
While some EU countries like Germany and Britain are already actively 
seeking out investments and trading opportunities in India, other members 
of the bloc arent yet aware of Indias enormous potential.
    
The European Commission is saying that ties between India and the EU 
should be extended and deepened, says an EU official. India should no 
longer be viewed as a mere beneficiary of EU aid. We should see it as a 
partner.
    
Others in the Commission admit that many EU countries view of India is 
still stuck in the 1980s. The recent fundamental changes that have taken 
place in Indias foreign and economic policies have gone largely unnoticed. 
   
India wants to beef up its relations with the West, the Commission paper 
says.
    
At the same time, EU companies can stand to benefit from Indias economic 
liberalisation and Delhis continuing search for foreign investors. 
Policies followed by new Indian Prime Minister Deve Gowda are unlikely to 
change this trend, according to Commission experts.
    
Much to Delhis chagrin, Marins policy paper doesnt call for any trade 
concessions, only a promise that both sides will give priority attention 
to eliminating obstacles to trade.
    
EU officials say this is deliberate: instead of getting entangled in petty 
trade squabbles, Marin wants to focus on ways of reinforcing political and 
economic contacts between the two sides.
    
Relations with Pakistan are on trickier ground. Although political and 
economic ties between Brussels and Islamabad are largely problem-free, 
complaints against Pakistans use of child labour made by international 
trade unions have injected certain strains in the relationship.
    
The unions accusations havent stopped the European Commission from 
pressing ahead with plans for a new trade and economic co-operation pact 
with Pakistan.
    
But, the new agreement is expected to include a specific clause outlining 
the EUs plans to help Pakistan in combating child labour.
    
The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has asked the 
Commission to stop giving Pakistan trade preferences because under-age 
workers are employed in its carpet sector.
    
EU member states are still divided on the issue. Despite several meetings, 
they have been unable to agree on whether the European Commission should 
start its own investigation into the ICFTUs allegations.
    
EU insiders say that instead of focusing on negative sanctions, 
Commissioner Marin will tell Pakistani officials the EU wants to work with 
Islamabad on development and education programmes to end the abuse of child 
workers.
    
The focus is on positive incentives, according to the EU sources. As one EU 
insider put it, child labour is unacceptable, but it cant be solved 
through sanctions.
    
Still, the pressure to end the exploitation of under-age workers will 
continue. EU policy makers are sensitive to charges that they cannot point 
an accusing finger at Pakistan alone, when the ICFTU and others acknowledge 
that the problem is equally severe in other parts of South Asia and Latin 
America.
    
Hence the emphasis on development programmes and offers of EU help to 
combat the problem. The inclusion of a specific clause on the subject in 
the new pact with Pakistan will also ensure that the issue of child labour 
remains in the spotlight in future relations between Islamabad and 
Brussels.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 27: The Sindh Assembly passed a Rs 59.61 billion budget for 
the 1996-97 year with a four amendments to the Finance Bill.

The most significant of these is the amendment that will make it compulsory 
for the provincial government to utilise all taxes collected from a 
particular district on development schemes for that district alone.
    
The other more significant amendment is one that will expand the tax base 
in the service sector to include all professional groups previously 
exempted. Further, the stamp duty on the transfer of shares has been fixed 
at Rs 1. This is an amendment to section 3 of the Finance Bill. Under 
another amendment, this time to section 4, 20 per cent of the annual 
assessed value of any property will be levied as property tax.

The MQM opposition, continuing its boycott, was not present in the House.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sajid Iqbal and Rafaqat Ali

LAHORE, June 27: Local bodies chiefs and public representatives, elected in 
1991, dethroned in August 1993 and restored to their offices by the Supreme 
Court were not allowed by the government functionaries to take over the 
institutions.
    
A showdown occurred at least in Lahore and Rawalpindi where the municipal 
chiefs and councillors, nearly all of them belonging to the Pakistan Muslim 
League, occupied the offices of the administrators appointed by the 
government. However, the administrators and other officials later told them 
that they could take over the institutions only after the issuance of a 
government notification in this regard.
    
Barely hours later, the Punjab government, in a bid to neutralise the 
verdict of the Supreme Court, moved a bill in the provincial assembly and 
got it passed within three hours, making the restored local bodies 
ineffective. Immediately after the bill was passed, the Punjab government 
appointed new administrators to all the municipal bodies throughout the 
province.
    
In Lahore, in the wake of the Supreme Court judgement restoring local 
bodies in Punjab, deputy mayors and councillors of the Metropolitan 
Corporation of Lahore, thronged the Town Hall in the morning. Accompanied 
by PML workers, they occupied the office of MCL administrator Tariq Shafi 
Chak and PPP stalwart Haji Azizur Rahman Chan, who was recently appointed 
by the Punjab government to take charge of the corporations affairs. 
Neither of them was present in his office.
    
The PML men at the Town Hall met the MCLs chief officer and said they had 
come to assume charge of their offices following the Supreme Court verdict. 
They were told that they could do so only after the receipt of a government 
notification, which had not been issued so far.

<a name="move">Move afoot for combined opposition group in NA </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, June 28: Efforts have been started for creating a combined 
opposition group in the National Assembly to prevent the government from 
pursuing anti-people policies and the PML is supporting these efforts. 
The move is being billed as a precursor to a broad-based opposition 
alliance.

A move is being made by the Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan (Noorani group) which 
wants that the PML and its allied parties, the parties in the Milli 
Yakjehti Council and the recently-constituted independent group led by 
Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan should join hands against the government.

Informed sources told Dawn on Friday that PML President Nawaz Sharif at a 
meeting with Maulana Noorani supported these efforts and indicated that he 
was willing to work in co-ordination with other parties which are not part 
of the government.

Opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly Mian Shahbaz Sharif expressed 
similar views at a couple of meetings with JUP Information Secretary Pir 
Ijaz Hashmi.

The JUP (Niazi group), the Awami National Party and the Jamiat Ahle Hadith 
of Professor Sajid Mir are already working as allies of the PML(N) and 
invariably they follow all policies decided by Mian Nawaz Sharif.

<a name="lhca">LHC asks police to register case against PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

RAWALPINDI, July 3: The Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court ordered 
police to register a case against the prime minister, interior minister, 
chief minister Punjab, and three other officials of the district 
administration on the complaint of Jamaat-i-Islami for the murder of its 
two workers in Rawalpindi on June 24.

Justice Rashid Aziz Khan also held that if police at any stage of 
investigation come to the conclusion that false statement was made by the 
petitioner he should be prosecuted.
    
The order was passed on the petition of Amir Jamaat-i-Islami Rawalpindi 
filed on June 25. Rawalpindi police refused to register a murder case of 
two JI workers who were killed by the security agencies in Rawalpindi on 
June 24.
    
The petitioner in his report had held prime minister Benazir Bhutto, 
interior minister Naseerullah Khan Babar, chief minister Punjab Sardar Arif 
Nakie, commissioner Rawalpindi Kamran Zafar, deputy commissioner Rawalpindi 
Zafar Iqbal Awan, and assistant commissioner Iftikhar Shelwani responsible 
for the killing of the two JI workers.

<a name="poli">Political meddling blamed for fall in policing standards</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, July 3: Punjab Police Inspector-General Abbas Khan has blamed 
frequent conflicts between law and executive commands as one of the 
important reasons for a gradual deterioration in policing standards.

He expresses this opinion in a paper titled Problems of law and order and 
police reforms sent to legislators and other decision-makers in a bid to 
stimulate thinking on the creation of a truly professional, democratically 
controlled and politically neutral police force. A copy of his paper was 
sent to newspapers also.

The papers release comes amidst Punjab-wide concern over deteriorating law 
and order, particularly in the cities. He points out that overall crime 
rate in the Punjab is on a consistent rise since independence. But, he 
explains that the provinces population was 20.5 million in 1951 whereas it 
is reported to be about 71 million in 1995.

The IG suggests that the Police Act of 1861, enacted to serve the colonial 
requirements of the Raj, should be replaced. The new act, he pleads, must 
provide for a police for the people and win the trust of society at 
large.

He recommends the establishment of a multi-party public safety commission 
at the federal and provincial levels which will safeguard the interest of 
citizens and secure the police from external pressure. The commission will 
have representation from politicians, jurists, scholars, journalists and 
social workers.

To execute the commissions policy, the IG suggests a national police 
agency under a senior officer with the responsibility for management of the 
force, research and planning, training and traffic control on highways.

Mr Khan refers to a UN mission report presented to the government during a 
recent visit which said the degeneration of the police force in Pakistan 
was because successive governments had failed to equip the police with 
adequate training as a result of which it was completely unprepared to deal 
with the present situation. Since 1960, governments had ignored 
recommendations of as many as 11 committees or commissions and four 
international missions.

specially by finding out new tax payers in the country.
    
The main thrust of the campaign is to unearth tax evaders and this job 
will be done through examination of Capital Value Tax (CVT) payments, 
electricity bills, school fees of children, foreign trip and mobile phone 
charges for the items which formed an essential component of the tax - 
returns prepared last year but were dropped except two on the directive of 
the prime minister, said Chairman CBR Mr Alvi Abdul Rahim.
    
He told Dawn that his organisation planned to identify at least 400,000 new 
tax payers. One of the main things would be that the shopkeepers and 
owners of the factories would have to display their National Taxation 
Number (NTN), he warned.
    
He said now the CBR has started issuing new flawless NTNs which have to be 
obtained and displayed by all the concerned. And if they do not do that 
they would have to pay a fine of Rs 2000, Alvi said.
    
He pointed out that the revenue collection have been raised to Rs 76 
billion during 1995-96. But the new financial year will see substantial 
increase because no tax evader will go unchecked, he stressed.
    
He said the tax receipts have gone up from Rs 36 billion to Rs 76 billion 
just in three months, increasing the ratio of direct taxes as compared to 
indirect taxes.
    
Mr Alvi pointed out that the CBR planned to undertake a better strategy for 
improving revenue collection specially by enhancing its administrative 
efficiency, conduction countrywide surveys of potential income tax payers, 
and matching  of information through computers and identifying non-NTN 
holders.

<a name="expo">Exports face yet another bleak future</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, June 27: Pakistans exports face a bleak prospect in the 
financial year 1996-97 again, after a dismal performance of this sector in 
the current year  thanks to higher taxes not only on the industrial raw 
materials and machinery, but as well as, on hospital-related equipment, 
according to knowledgeable quarters.
    
It, therefore, seems likely that the announcement of a new trade policy for 
1996-97 will be delayed because the ministry of commerce officials are 
still busy evaluating the impact of substantial increase in taxes on almost 
entire spectrum of export-related imports. 
   
This may necessitate re-adjustment of incentives for industries involved in 
exports at higher tariffs.
    
It is feared that the inflated taxes will further hit the already 
languishing manufacturing sector. There may also be a repeated recourse to 
devalue the currency in the vain hope to strengthen the sagging exports, 
and to enhance the competitiveness of our products in foreign markets. 
   
As the experience of the current year shows, however, such adhocism will be 
disadvantageous for our industry, because of the consequent rise in their 
cost of production, according to the source.

Superficially, the budget has reduced the import duty on 282 items 
including metals, chemicals, machinery and parts thereof, which are 
essential for the manufacturing sector in general and the exports industry, 
in particular. 
   
In fact, however, 228 items have been burdened with additional taxes, 
because each item, besides, import duty, has been made liable to 10 per 
cent regulatory duty and 18 per cent sales tax.
    
Thus items on which import duty has been reduced from 65 per cent of CAF 
value to 55%, 50%, 45% or even 35%, the taxation will far exceed that 
original level after adding the regulatory duty and sales tax. 
   
In same cases, the real tax effect may exceed 73%. In fact, according to an 
analysis of the Central Board of Revenues lists of various categories of 
items on which the taxes have purportedly been reduced, real tax relief has 
been made available in the case of only 54 items. An informed source 
doubted that reduced tax on these will have more than a nominal positive 
bearing on foreign exchange earning capacity of Pakistan.

<a name="want">Wanted: more private capital for the power sector</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From M. Ziauddin

PAKISTAN will need to create additional power generation capacity of 54,000 
MW in the next 25 years against the current production of 13,000 MW, in 
order to meet its long term demand, increasing at the rate of 8 per cent 
per annum, according to a latest report on the potential, problems and 
prospects of power sector submitted to the government in March, 1996.
    
Also, the present generation capacity of 13000 MW has been found to be 
extremely insufficient to meet the demand on a year round basis, at 
different times of the year, particularly during the period of low river 
flows, when consumers are subjected to load-shedding.
    
The magnitude of this shortage is estimated to be around 2,300 MW, about 38 
per cent of the computed demand, persisting for several months during peak 
load hours. 
   
This results not only in inconvenience to normal life but a loss of 
national work hours and discouragement to industry. The annual direct 
economic loss to industry has been estimated to be about $ 500 million 
because of load shedding.
    
At current generation prices, it would cost Pakistan at least $ 50 billion 
to meet its demand for power over the next quarter century which would mean 
an average investment of two billion dollars a year over the next 25 years.  
   
Pakistan lacks this kind of spare resources considering the ever mounting 
demands from competing sectors like, water, roads, communication, 
transport, health, population, education and defence etc. Moreover, the 
Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), the public sector 
organisation which has been looking after generation, transmission and 
distribution of power in Pakistan for the last four decades has gradually 
turned into a white elephant saddled with a massive load of corruption and 
totally incapable of ensuring efficient production and operation.  
   
According to one rough estimate as much as 35 per cent of power generated 
by WAPDA units is pilfered or wasted while the Authoritys financial 
viability is becoming ever more doubtful. 
   
The situation has deteriorated to such an extent that at the fag end of the 
current year WAPDA had to seek an urgent assistance of Rs. 1.11 billion 
from the government in order to avert a certain default.
    
WAPDA seemingly has neither the technical and management ability to perform 
its functions efficiently, nor does it have the financial resources to make 
the massive investments needed to add the required generation, transmission 
and distribution capacity to meet the short and long term future demands. 
In short, the power sector in the country is in dire straits at present. 
   
The generation as well as distribution networks are the typical cases of 
state-run dinosaurs in the developing world. The present problem is two-
pronged: 
   
1. The gap between the demand and supply. It needs such massive investment 
that it is no more possible for the resource starved government to finance 
it. The capital is needed for the new power generation and also for the 
maintenance and expansion of the existing power plants. 2. High 
transmission and distribution losses have to be avoided. Distribution 
networks also need capital for maintenance and expansion. 
   
The only source for such huge capital now is the private sector. 
   
It is almost impossible to mobilise the required capital and modern 
technology to improve cost efficiency from the local private sector, 
therefore international investment has to be sought. The current demand-
supply state is going to be changed once the power sector goes into joint 
hands of the local/foreign private sector. 
   
For one, more electricity will be available without even raising the 
production because of better and efficient distribution. The efficiently 
run networks will lower the fluctuation rate and this will result in a 
higher demand due to satisfied consumers. 
   
It was in this backdrop that the successive governments in Pakistan since 
1985 were seen to be examining the possibility of inducting the private 
sector in the countrys power sector. The 1300 MW Hub power plant which is 
about to start supplying electricity to the southern part of the country 
was the first power station entirely financed, installed and operated by 
the private sector. 
   
And following the announcement in 1994 of a highly attractive power policy, 
the government has received proposals for production of 26,000 MW of power 
in the private sector. So far the government has issued 34 Letters of 
Support(LoS) for producing about 9062 MW(gross) MW of electricity. So far 
financial close for 1900 MW has been achieved. 
   
Those which have achieved financial close include: AES1 (Lalpir) for 337 
MW; AES 11( Pakgen) for 337 MW; Kohinoor Electric for 120 MW; Southern for 
112 MW; Japan power for 197 MW; Power generation systems for 110 MW; Tri 
Star energy for 103 MW; Gul Ahmad for 125 MW and Uch for 525 MW. The total 
power to be generated by these projects would come to about 3076 MW while 
the eighth plan ending June 30, 1996 had envisaged commissioning of 2500-
2700 MW capacity in the private sector.  
   
Meanwhile, the World Bank, in order to keep the consequent financial burden 
(estimated to be about one billion dollars a year on tariff alone) on 
Pakistan well within its paying capacity, has slapped a 2,500 MW limit 
until 1998 on the issuance of LoS to private sector sponsors. Side by side 
the government has also started privatising WAPDAs power plants. 
   
Kot Addu was the first such unit to be privatised. It has gone to the world 
reknown National Power of Britain and is expected to become cost efficient 
in due course of time with the induction of the most modern management and 
technical skills. 
   
The government has also awarded to the National Power contract for laying 
down the additional transmission lines to cater to the electricity 
generated by the upcoming private power stations. 
   
And with the initiation of the process of privatisation of Faisalabad Area 
Electricity Board, the government has also begun handing over the function 
of distribution of electricity to the private sector which would go a long 
way in eliminating pilferages and correct billings, bringing down 
considerably the cost of taking per unit of electricity to the consumers. 
Electricity is presently available to only 40 per cent of the population 
and per capita consumption of electricity per annum in Pakistan at 300 Kwh 
is extremely low compared to world averages. 
   
There are about 150,000 villages in Pakistan out of which only 35 per cent 
have been connected to the national grid. Pakistan has a programme to 
provide electricity to about 6000 villages a year. At this rate it would 
take 15 years and a lot of money to give electricity to all the villages. 
Moreover this will add an uneconomic load on the WAPDA grid which is 
already recurring several billion rupees financial loss in connection with 
rural electrification. 
   
In order to provide electricity as social service to all the people it 
would require some special programmes to tap all types of resources , 
hydel, solar and wind energy. 
   
Hydel power being more economical and readily harnessable is considered to 
be singularly capable of providing tariff relief to the consumers, utilise 
indigenous resources, involve Pakistani entrepreneurs and provide benefits 
of economic growth to the relatively backward areas of Pakistan. In this 
connection, the government has already initiated a five billion dollar 
project (Ghazi Brotha) of 1400 MW in the public sector. But in order to 
fill the widening supply/ demand gap relatively quickly and more 
economically the government has also prepared plans to induct the private 
in the process in a big way. 
   
The hydel power potential in Pakistan is estimated to be to the tune of 
about 30,000 MW, only 15 per cent of which has been tapped so far. In this 
regard the government is studying a proposal to create a Hydel Planning 
Fund amounting to 30 million dollars. 
   
This amount is proposed to be spent in preparation of feasibility reports 
in the public sector as the key to success of hydel power policy is the 
availability of reliable feasibility studies as these take a long time and 
money to prepare. To facilitate the pace of feasibility studies, the 
government will initiate preparation of such studies in the public sector 
for many sites so that, after a few years, a number of feasibility studies 
become available. 
   
These feasibility reports can then be implemented by the private sector on 
a competitive basis. In Pakistan, nearly all hydro potential results from 
discharges into the Indus River basin. 
   
Discharges result primarily from precipitation and snow melt in the 
northern mountainous ranges of the country. Discharges take place in small 
rivulets coming further down to the bigger tributaries of river Indus and 
then to the Indus river itself. 
   
The development of hydro power projects, however, are characterised by 
remote locations and seasonal variations. Notwithstanding this, there are 
several attractive sites near load centres, on the irrigation canals with 
its quite vast network of 58,500 kilometres in length and withdrawals of 
106 MAF.

<a name="thea">The agony of the lending trap</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikramul Haq

ANNUAL budget-making in our country has become a routine bureaucratic 
exercise, devoid of any economic insight that can improve the existing 
state of affairs. It is no longer a policy document that is reflective of 
any kind of economic philosophy, not to talk of a measure through which the 
ruling party intends to fulfil its election manifesto (probably a dead 
entity now?)
    
Over the past, Pakistans reliance on foreign aid has increased manifold. 
Now we find ourselves thoroughly caught in the lending trap. Not a single 
budget during the last decade has suggested any means to reduce this 
dependence on foreign and self-reliance is, perhaps, a forgotten word in 
our economic planning. The rulers owe an explanation to the people of 
Pakistan as to why they have been made a nation of beggars.
    
There is hardly an issue of the World Bank News in which Pakistan does not 
feature as a borrower, and often the largest borrower. We have been 
receiving millions of dollars every year from the IMF and World Bank to 
improve the countrys power transmission capability and many other 
development projects.
    
A number of other loans have also been announced from time to time by other 
agencies like the IMF. A spokesman of the World Bank was at a recent 
meeting apparently so pleased with Pakistans amazing progress in 
economic recovery that he thought that the next annual meeting of the Bank-
sponsored aid to Pakistan group would be a clinch.
    
The question arises: do we need this foreign money? Most aid programmes, 
with the major exception of petroleum development, have one thing in common 
- they have virtually no foreign exchange content and their financing has 
to be done in rupees. For example, the improvement of civic amenities in 
the Lahore walled city does not really call for World Bank money. We have 
the necessary equipment and management capability to do it ourselves.
    
Foreign aid was initially meant to bridge the external payments gap arising 
out of essential imports required for building up industrial 
infrastructure. Later, the emphasis shifted from development to maintenance 
and the so-called non-project aid was also used for this purpose.
    
Now the clever officials in the Finance Ministry have discovered a new 
hurdle - the alleged shortage of rupee resources. Since their case is 
palpably weak, they are trying to sell the package through such impressive-
sounding phrases as uplift of the poor, employment generation and rural 
development.
    
I am not very sure whether the World Bank is not paying us a left-handed 
compliment by giving us a good chit about our economic recovery. The year 
1995-96 has been bad all round. Food grain production has gone down by a 
million tonnes. For five long years we have more or less stood still, with 
a few ups and downs in between, but that as not what is meant by 
recovery.
    
Look at industry. It is conceded that overall industrial growth may be no 
more than a measly two per cent. It was earlier expected to be around 5 to 
7 per cent. That is what the Economic Survey issued on June 11 says. More 
disturbing is the fact that our major industries like steel maintained 
growth at a snails pace, varying from 0.5 to 1.5 per cent.
    
Pakistan Steel has large unsold stocks on hand and is said to have finished 
the year with a whopping loss. Why does it have huge unsold stocks? Because 
it could not compete with imported steel. And why did we import steel with 
the money we borrowed from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)?
    
The net result of all this is inflation which has been in the double-digit 
for the last many years. Farm products are the most affected in recent 
years. The price of cereals went up by 25 per cent, oilseeds 20 per cent, 
sugar 16 per cent and tobacco 29 per cent. The prices of industrial 
products have also gone up.
    
The government now does not have much to crow about, since even the price 
indicator, the only redeeming feature of a rundown economy, has decided to 
play up. For a poor country like Pakistan, farm production, industrial 
output and price inflation are the main indications. Then how does the 
picture add up to one of amazing recovery. Would the picture have been 
different, if we had more foreign exchange or aid to play with? Most 
unlikely. 
   
Take agriculture. One reason cited for the fall in farm output is the 
increasing reluctance of farmers to use high-priced fertilisers.
    
But the country is not short of fertilisers at all. In a year in which the 
governments coffers were full to the brim with foreign money ranging from 
SDRs (Special Drawing Rights) from the World Bank, agriculture continued 
to go downhill, pulling down many other sectors with it.
    
The same is true of industry. Businessmen have been complaining of poor off 
take and high idle capacity, not of foreign exchange. In fact, if steel and 
fertilisers, not to mention soda ash and synthetic fibres, had not been 
imported so generously, industrial production would have improved, and with 
it many other things. 
   
The easy access to foreign exchange may have helped new industries but its 
overall impact has been negative.
    
It has not even helped keep prices down, the main reason why imports were 
allowed in the first place. Sudden imports, like sudden exports on an 
unusually lavish scale, have an unsettling effect on economies like 
Pakistan, which are neither fully industrial nor fully agricultural. 
   
No doubt closed economies should be opened up, but the valves should be 
opened gently, a twist at a time. 
    
If there is no such thing as a free lunch, there is also no such thing as 
free aid. If one is too casual in accepting aid, just because the World 
Bank or some other organisation is overflowing with the milk of human 
kindness, one will also be too casual in spending it.
    
Most of the projects taken up in the country do not require outside 
assistance at all. People in the sub-continent have been building roads, 
houses and huts for decades, if not centuries. All you need is cement, 
bricks, pipes and steel. We make all these things here, and we have so much 
surplus manpower, both technical as well as unskilled, that we dont know 
what to do with it. Do we really need foreign assistance to do things we 
can do on our own, and which we should do on our own, if self-reliance has 
any meaning.

Peculiar psychosis
    
We are the victims of a peculiar psychosis which small men suffer from when 
they have to handle big problems or what they consider big problems. We 
think our problems are so vast that only international agencies like the 
IMF and the World Bank can solve. 
    
You want a 1,000-km canal to be dug up, call in the World Bank. You want to 
lay a transmission line, call an IMF expert. You want to build 10,000 low 
cost houses for the poor in Lahore, get a report from some UN agency. But 
surely a 1,000 km canal can be done in a 100 stretches of 10 km each, just 
as a colony of 10,000 houses can be taken in hand in lots of 100 or 1,000 
units. We have the raw material, the men, the organisational skills. Then 
why waste time?
    
Cherez la femme, meaning look for the woman, if there is a scandal. In all 
international negotiations, it is look for the cash. The moneybags in 
Washington keep on flashing green signals to Islamabad and other embattled 
capitals of the impoverished Third World. Their message is loud and clear. 
Come and help yourself. Why not! Because the Third World countries need the 
money, because some of them may do, but because the bankers are flushed 
with cash, more cash than they can use.
    
The World Bank, in fact, has a lot of cash floating about its vaults. Its 
capacity to borrow is much more than what it is borrowing now and 
subsequently the capacity to lend much more than what it is lending now. 
   
There is the reason behind the generosity being showered upon us!
    
Our governments are hungry for cash: through subsidies, cash through loans, 
and cash through grants. 
   
This is unfortunate. Development requires money but more money does not 
necessarily mean development, and often, as in the case of Pakistan, it may 
lead to loss.

<a name="rais">Raising tax level : A recipe for  truncating  revenues?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Dr Farrukh Saleem

OUR budget-makers have once again elected to maintain the long-established 
status quo wherein government revenues are deliberately overestimated and 
its expenditures routinely underestimated. Even after an internationally 
exaggerated revenue stream and under-budgeted expenditures, the true 
budgetary gap still stands at a colossal Rs 163.8 billion; an alarming 189 
per cent of the total expected direct taxation in the country. The plan to 
fill the gap depends on foreign aid of Rs 102.9 billion, bank borrowings of 
Rs 20 billion and additional taxation of Rs 40.9 billion.
    
Towards the second half of the fiscal year-and after a series of mini 
budgets  it will suddenly dawn on our financial (mis) managers that 
government expenditures are far ahead of what had been budgeted for and the 
expected revenues are far short of expectations.
    
There is simply no way of extracting additional taxation of Rs 40.9 billion 
for the governments coffers because no one has yet derived a way of 
sucking blood from stones.
    
Our financial wizards would then go on a borrowing binge, violating the 
self-imposed bank borrowing limit by at least 400 per cent followed by a 
desperate search for cash from every government-owned corporation in sight. 
   
At the end of the year the governments hired financial jugglers shall go 
on a frantic hunt for short-term domestic and foreign loans in order to 
meet IMF conditionalities and ultimately report to massive doctoring of 
figures.

Over-burdened payers

The truth of the matter is that the current net of tax payers is overly 
burdened even under the existing tax regime and increasing their tax slabs 
shall not yield any additional revenue for the government.
    
Dr Arthur Laffer, once a professor at the prestigious University of 
Southern California (USC) and also an adviser to President Reagan, 
theorised that starting at a tax slab of zero per cent government would not 
be generating any revenue at all. Conversely, at a tax slab of 100 per 
cent, no one would have any incentive to work (as the government is taking 
away all of what one earns) and government revenue shall presumably be back 
to zero.
    
Dr Laffer, therefore, postulates that government revenue that initially 
increases as the percentage of tax slabs is increased, but that it take 
shall begin to taper off, become flat for a while and any further increase 
in the percentage of tax slabs from that point onwards shall actually 
decrease the government revenue (see graph). There is, this, a particular 
tax slab a definite percentage range where the government can actually 
maximise its revenue.
    
The hypothetical Laffer Curve concept is now more than 15 years old, but 
our government, it appears, is yet to comprehend the basic philosophy 
behind any policy of rational taxation.
    
Our current set of economic managers feel as if a simple increase in the 
percentage of tax slabs shall also result in increased government revenue. 
Every successive government for the past several decades has been adamantly 
increasing the burden of taxation on what essentially amounts to less than 
one per cent of the countrys population.
    
Every year the revenue-expenditure gap deteriorates, and come the next 
budget, we are surely going to require a further increase in taxation. 
Given our constraint of 800,000 or so individual income tax payers, the 
government has perhaps already crossed the optimal point where it could 
maximise its own share.
    
Any increase, let us say beyond a 35 per cent to 45 per cent tax bracket, 
is bound to be detrimental for the government itself. That is an economic 
certainty and the past several budgets have already all but affirmed that 
particular financial reality.
    
In the Pakistani context, the maximum direct tax revenue from the current 
net of tax payers seems to peak out at around Rs 35 billion within the 
range of a 35 per cent to 40 per cent tax bracket. 
   
The government with new moves directed at income tax payers that take 
individual slabs beyond that range shall not only decrease government 
revenue but also slow down economic activity, lower the output of the 
economy and further dampen the potential of revenue collection.
    
As long as we remain steadfastly committed to spending 15 per cent of our 
direct tax revenue on defence, we are going to be left with no alternative 
but to bring in more tax payers from the sectors that are not currently 
under the tax net.

Fairplay missing
    
There is no denying also that government revenues need to be enhanced and 
any revenue enhancement exercise shall not only be politically feasible but 
economically efficient and equitable as well. The budget stands as a vocal 
witness to the fact that the current leadership neither has any sense of 
fair play nor of political or economic expediency.
    
The budget document increases the burdens on corporate employees while the 
same document exempts the bureaucrats. It bestows exempt status to 
residential properties of land-holders while it taxes urban dwellers. It 
exempts Pajeros while shop-keepers must submit monthly return.
    
Income taxation is a federal matter around the world but our federal 
administrators deflect it to provincial authorities when it comes to taxing 
agriculture incomes. 
   
Income taxation ought to be source-neutral but in Pakistan if you make Rs 
10 million every year by selling mangoes you are tax- exempt but if you 
generate an income of a mere Rs 100,000 per year, the tax collector wants 
to take it all. Rs 20 million of new taxation for the agriculturists and Rs 
40 billion for the rest. Talk about discriminatory policies and the budget 
has them all. Talk about equitable taxation and the budget has absolutely 
none of that.
    
The only way out is not another increase in tax rates but a definite 
decrease in across-the-board taxation that would not only increase the 
supply of savings, but also expand output, employment and capital 
accumulation. And along with all these increases the potential for 
government taxation would have expanded as well. Is politics fast becoming 
the last refuge for the most incompetent in the society.

<a name="priv">Private freight train discussion on 9th</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mansoor Alam

KARACHI, July 2: Investors from the USA, Canada, UK, South Africa and Hong 
Kong will participate in a meeting to be held next Tuesday to discuss terms 
and conditions for operating private railway freight train, under the open 
access policy announced by the government on May 14, 1996.
    
The meeting is being organised by the Private Power and Infrastructure 
Board (PPIB), in a bid to commence private freight train operations in 
Pakistan by end December, 1997. Bids will be submitted to (PPIB) in August, 
1996 and the government expects to award the residual fuel oil 
transportation contract to the successful party by October, 1996.
    
The successful company will provide an adequate amount of reliable 
equipment, appropriate maintenance facilities and sufficient competent 
staff to guarantee long-term security of the supply of fuel oil to the 
power plants. Initial volume is 1.78 million tonnes per annum over an 
average route length of 980 kilometres.
    
The opportunity exists to expand traffic volumes for oil and into other 
railway freight traffic such as intermodal containers, perishable goods and 
bulk materials of all kinds, including solids, liquids and gasses.
    
The private railway freight operating company will have an opportunity to 
transport residual fuel oil, over Pakistan Railways track, from Pipri to 7 
new power plants commencing from the beginning of July, 1997.
    
The successful company will contract with the Pakistan Railways to purchase 
track access and secure its income through a long-term fuel transportation 
agreement with the Pakistan State Oil, as well as granting incentives to 
the new company.

ISLAMABAD, July 3: Marathon talks between the government and the Federation 
of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry concluded without an agreement 
on the most cantankerous issue of fixed sales tax on 28 industries, FPCCI 
President Senator Ilyas Ahmed Bilour told a news conference.
    
The government, he said, had reneged from its promise made last week to 
continue the fixed tax scheme on the plea that the International Monetary 
Fund had refused to budge from its insistence on doing away with it. The 
government had, instead, advised the FPCCI leaders to approach the IMF in 
this regard.
    
But we will not go to the IMF, the FPCCI president declared. It was for 
the government to deal with the IMF whose conditions it had acquiesced in 
without consulting the business community. Did they ask us before they put 
the country at the mercy of IMF? asked Senator Bilour.

<a name="lead">Leading scrips show best gains amid brisk trading</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, June 27: Leading shares in unison posted one of best gains in the 
years as year-end strong support figured prominently at the attractively 
lower level. Trading was brisk but sellers were reluctant to sell 
anticipating further rise in prices.

The market seemed to have derived its major strength from the news that the 
government has accepted most of the demand of the business and industry 
after Islamabads three-day meeting between the officials and big business, 
they added.
    
Floor brokers said the current political tension and the Oppositions 
threat to launch movement against the government to unseat it could take 
its toll but indications are that positive corporate background news might 
keep it in a good shape.
    
The portfolio buying figured prominently on most of the MNCs and local blue 
chips lifting their prices beyond the expectations of any analyst just in 
one go, they added.
    
Lever Brothers, for instance, rose Rs 100 to Rs 800, although it still far 
below its peak level of Rs 1400, but demonstrated it is reeling back to its 
chart point of Rs 1,000 during the next few weeks.
    
The interesting feature was that 2,200 shares were traded at the rising 
prices and there were buyers well above this rate. After having risen by 
well over Rs 30, Wellcome Pakistan maintained its upward drive on sustained 
support and so did Reckitt and Colman, Rafhan Maize, Engro Chemicals, and 
Brooke Bond, rising by Rs 5 to 11.
    
But notable feature was that both Siemens and Singer Pakistan after last 
three days decline, came in for strong support at the lower rates and rose 
by Rs 10 to 30, with dealing purely being on the spot basis.

Other good gainers were led by EFU, Sanghar Sugar, Shell Pakistan, PSO, 
National Fibre, and Glaxo Lab, which posted gains ranging from Rs 5 to 8.
    
Al-Abid Silk, which has been under pressure for the last three sessions 
recovered and finished higher by Rs 20.
    
Among the prominent losers Nestle Milkpak was leading, off Rs 6 followed by 
International Industries, which fell by Rs 4 on selling at the higher 
levels.
    
Other losers were led by BOC Pakistan, Ciba-Geigy, Bhanero Textiles, 
Gulistan Textiles, and Pakistan Refinery.
    
The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, up 20 paisa on 
14.587m shares, followed by Hub-Power, unchanged on 3.835m, Dewan Salman, 
higher 95 paisa on 1.148m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, lower 25 paisa on 0643m, 
Pak Commercial Leasing, off one rupee on 0.536m, Fauji Fertiliser, 
unchanged on 0.224m and 4th ICP (r), lower 25 paisa on 0.175m shares. There 
were some other notable deals also.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by 4th ICP, 25th ICP, Askari Bank, 
Faysal Bank, Lucky Cement, Fauji Fertiliser and Reckitt and Colman, which 
rose Rs 3 on 0.144m shares.
    
Trading rose to 26.544m shares from the previous 26.463m shares .
    
There were 385 actives, out of which 198 shares fell, while 99 rose, with 
88 holding on to the last levels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 3: Stocks remained in a bearish frame of mind as investors 
were not inclined to take new positions even at the falling prices in the 
absence of institutional traders.
    
The KSE 100-share index suffered a fresh decline of 6.15 points at 1,670.13 
as compared to 1,676.28 a day earlier despite the fact that some of the 
base shares managed to put on a better show.
    
The opening was a bit sluggish as investors were not inclined to take new 
positions partly because of a virtual turmoil in the other major markets as 
confusion about the sales tax persisted.

However, a massive activity in Hub-Power after the news that its management 
will pay a dividend at the rate of 45 per cent after it plant goes into 
full production by 1998, was the only redeeming feature of sluggish market.

It was in this background that the bulk of the interest was centred around 
a dozen shares as no one was inclined to go beyond the safe havens. Prices 
elsewhere, fell although fractionally.

Insurance sector, which has a credible dividend record also joined the 
losers after it failed to achieve tax exemption on capital gains and bonus 
income.
    
Textile shares, facing both the shortage of lint and liquidity problems 
remained under pressure but leading synthetic shares were traded actively 
under the lead of Dewan Salman and Dhan Fibre, finishing steady.
    
Cement and energy shares were actively traded under the lead of current 
actives among them including Lucky Cement, Hub-Power, PSO, Sui Southern and 
Sui Northern but on-balance closing was mixed.
    
Much of the activity in the chemical and pharma sector was confined to the 
leading MNCs, which fell in general on selling at the higher levels which 
fell under the lead of Ciba-Geigy, Nestle Milkpak, Reckitt & Colman, Parke-
Davis and some others.
    
Singer Pakistan and Siemen Pakistan, which were chief gainers before they 
were put on the spot list suffered fresh setback and so did Lever Brothers 
and some other leading stocks including Brooke Bond.
    
Hub-Power topped the list of most actives, up five paisa on 17.841m shares 
followed by PTC vouchers, lower 40 paisa on 7.415m, Sui Southern, up Rs 
1.15 on 1.300m, FFC-Jordan fertiliser 0.495m, Dewan Salman, easy five paisa 
on 0.487m, Dhan Fibre, lower five paisa on 0.289m, Ibrahim Fibre, unchanged 
on 0.324m and LTV Modaraba, up 10 paisa on 0.229m shares.
    
Trading volume rose fell to 30.641m shares from the previous 33m shares, 
while losers led gainers by a big margin of 203 to 68, with       64 shares 
holding on to the last levels.
    
An interim dividend at the rate of 15 per cent from Abbott Lab came at a 
time when the market was already under pressure owing to external factor.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

LAST WEEK I was away from Karachi. I was in Islamabad, that green green 
capital that is truly a feast for the eyes of a man coming from the deserts 
and degradations of the city of Karachi.
    
Whilst there I spent a lot of time with my friends, the Chaudhry of Chakwal 
and the Begum of Bhagwal, Ayaz Amir and his wife Jamila. The Chaudhry has 
beaten me to it this week. What I intended to write in my column today, he 
has written already in his Monday column, and written better than I would 
have done. Even the Pet-ford educated would go along with what he has 
said.
    
Another attraction in Islamabad is my host, the jolly Miangul Aurangzeb, 
Wali Ahad of Swat by birth, a cavalry officer of the Pakistan Army by 
training, a first son-in-law by marriage, and now an honourable member of 
the opposition gracing the National Assembly. For his convenience, he has 
just declared that he is deaf.
    
Last Saturday afternoon we went to the circus. I was lulled to sleep by 
Nasrullahs steady drone, but not for long. I was awakened by the thumping 
of the Pipian desks heralding the entry of their bead-bearing star 
performer.
    
My friend, Balakh Sher, Tumandar of the Mazaris and a former Caretaker, 
then made a most sensible and life-saving suggestion: that Kashmir be made 
a UN protectorate until tempers cool and then the Kashmiris be given the 
choice over their own destiny, the third option included. This most 
practical of solutions will stop the daily blood-letting of the Muslims. 
The dead cant vote. I say, well done, Balakh.
    
On the way out we met that relatively decent veteran politician, silver-
haired Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, forlornly regretting that he had not sacked 
Salman Farooqi, as he had promised to do on becoming Caretaker Prime 
Minister in 1990.
    
Conversation in Islamabad centres around sleaze, the Surrey hideaway, loose 
boxes, the affidavit of former ISI chief General Asad Durrani in which he 
solemnly swears to have conspired to bribe politicians with the peoples 
money, the admirably correct attitude adopted by our judges, the 
Presidents frozen stance, the purchase of Mirages (obsolete as well as 
futuristic), kickbacks, waste, the falling from grace of Vaseem Jafarey and 
Falstaff Sadik, the exodus to come when the rats flee the sinking ship, and 
the reawakening of Nawaz.
    
But strangely enough, no one amongst the 216 members of our Parliament 
exhibited concern as to the state of our economy, as to how broke we really 
are. One of them explained the apathy: no legislator in Pakistan has been 
declared personally bankrupt. This phenomenon does not arise. Here, a 
politician borrows as much as his influence allows and not in terms of what 
he can pledge. Apart from that, when he borrows he knows the question of 
repaying does not arise. He expects to have the loan written off. He 
naturally thinks of his countrys borrowings in the same light.
    
Strangely also, many still give the benefit of the doubt to the President. 
They say that basically he is a good man who has been and still is being 
inveigled and manipulated. The purpose, they say, is to muddy him and 
therefore he seems more spattered than he really is. For example, the 
executive is procedurally impeding him from implementing the Supreme Court 
judgement handed down in the Judges Case. His supporters maintain that at 
least on one count he did not bend to pressure and denotify the Chief 
Justice as he was advised to do. He may well have realised that for his 
own survival he needs an independent judiciary. The opposition have, for 
once, drafted and sent a sensible letter to the President urging him to 
implement the judgement.
    
Leghari wants a second term. Like everyone else, once in a comfortable 
chair, the thought of leaving it is frightening. But he knows that his 
party does not want him re-elected. He must keep his options open, he must 
be seen to be a good boy. As there was pressure to instal him for his 
first term, there should be equal pressure to see him in for a second. In 
view of the economic disaster facing us, he would have a better chance with 
the people were he to curtail his shikar trips, and be seen to be as 
austere as the President of India by driving around in a locally made car. 
He is after all a Sardar, a Tumandar. Better is expected of him.
    
On to our de facto Finance Minister, Vaseem Jafarey. He has no one to blame 
for his own predicament but himself. When he was shot out with the PPP 
government in 1990, his complaint was, Well, what could I do? No one 
listened to me. And yet, when he was asked in 1993 to rejoin the wagon, he 
leapt on. Did he think he was dealing with leaders who had learnt a lesson, 
who had been chastised and were repentant? The confidence that those who 
knew him had in his integrity and financial ability has been dissipated. 
His well-wishers defend him by insisting that he was never involved in the 
taking of any kickbacks, or meddling in the making and breaking of shady 
deals.
    
However, the knowledgeable maintain that whether he consciously helped him 
or not, Jaffareys son-in-law, corporate lawyer Ahsan Rizvi, was given far 
more work than he merited by the Finance Ministry, the Corporate Law 
Authority and the Privatisation Commission, and that foreign firms dealing 
with these three bodies were nudged into disregarding any conflict of 
interest and retaining him at the fattest of fat fees. If this be true as 
figures would suggest, it is a relatively minor sin.
    
Half of Islamabad says that Jafarey has asked to be relieved, but 
permission has not been granted... The other half says that he is to be 
made a scapegoat and sent home. One wonders which clever idiot, lured by 
the prospect of amassing pelf, will volunteer to replace him. For what will 
an honest man be able to do, what will he inherit other than unrepayable 
debts? He will be lesser known and even lesser trusted by the World Bank, 
the IMF, and any other lenders that he may find. He will be accused of 
juggling with figures and he will be helpless when it comes to controlling 
sheer blatant waste, such as the building of a monument in Islamabad to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Republic at a cost of some Rs 100 
crores.
    
On the 24th, my last day in the capital, I was invited by Nawaz to a 
Punjabi lunch. Suffering has done him some good. He has become more 
coherent, more sensible, and can now string together a sequence of 
sentences. My advice to him was that his cause would be better served were 
he to convince the people that he is far from being a paragon of virtue, 
but that he is the lesser of two evils. Whether the advice sank in is 
questionable. He did say that were he to become PM once again he would 
appoint me as his adviser-in-chief. My answer was that if he does become PM 
again, he will have neither the inclination nor the time to even say hello 
to me. This raised a laugh from the twelve men around the table.
    
The sleaze surrounding the Surrey mansion, the 335 acres, and the loose 
boxes to stable 63 horses, has been dealt with by Nawaz correctly and 
constitutionally, Articles 62 and 63 of the Constitution, read together, 
stipulate that no be- iman can be a member of the National Assembly and 
should he be found to be one, he will be disqualified. A very well-worded, 
well-argued petition under Article 63(2) has been filed by Mian Mohammed 
Nawaz Sharif and others against Mohtarama Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister of 
Pakistan, and Asif Ali Zardari, Member of the National Assembly. As 
required, it has been handed over to the Speaker who is duty-bound to place 
it before the Chief Election Commissioner. The petition relates to the 
continuing gross violation of constitutional provisions of fundamental 
importance by the respondents and prays that they be declared as having 
become disqualified from being members of the National Assembly and that 
their respective seats, NA-166 and NA-160, be declared vacant.
    
Lastly, whilst over in the States Professor Wirsing, Richard Haas and 
Ambassador Oakley (and others) are researching and writing a report, 
Pakistan, a Failed State, for their respective research councils, let 
those of us who can, laugh. A wit has reminded Falstaff Sadik that when an 
exodus starts and seats are scarce (with everyone wanting to run with 
chickens and chattels), airlines normally restrict the carriage of weight. 
In Iran in 1978-79 the total weight of a man and his baggage was restricted 
to 250 lbs. If that applies here, Falstaff may just about be able to take 
his toothbrush with him.

<a name="afat">A fate worse than death</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

THE retirement of a civil servant, specially if he was fairly senior in the 
hierarchy, is regarded as a time of mourning by him and his family: it is 
almost as if he is shedding his earthly files to meet the secretary-general 
in the Sky.
    
Whenever I attend farewell dinners or receptions for officials who have 
attained the age of superannuation, I am always struck by the lugubrious 
nature of these functions. Speech after speech eulogising the services of 
the retiring official sounds as though he had been suddenly called away to 
become a celestial OSD. Indeed, all these somewhat tedious affairs have a 
funereal aspect. None of the speakers says he is envious of his departing 
colleague for finally being out of the rat race; rather, there is a 
distinct rather him than me tone to the speeches.
    
True, saying good-bye to a colleague does have an element of sadness, but 
surely not to the point of deep gloom. The farewell gifts invariably 
include a set of holy texts and commentaries; the implication being that 
since the retirees life is now effectively over, he should spend his 
remaining days in contemplation and prayer. Nobody thinks of giving a 
camera or a stamp album to launch him on a new hobby. There are no jokes, 
no reminders of humorous episodes.
    
Some of this despondency emanates from the knowledge that retirement leads 
immediately and directly to a lower standard of living. There are no office 
cars, no free telephones and a sharply reduced income. But more intolerable 
than this financial hardship is the instant vacuum superannuation produces: 
what will somebody who has been used to wielding enormous responsibility 
and authority do with his time when he turns 60?
    
In many countries, civil servants cultivate hobbies and interests far 
removed from their official lives. Here, this is the exception rather than 
the rule. Our bureaucrats are usually so caught up with duties and 
responsibilities that they have virtually no other lives. More often than 
not, they take no vacations for fear that they will be re-assigned if they 
take a few weeks off. They have few friendships outside their small circle 
of professional colleagues, and apart from newspapers and official 
documents, they dont read anything. Because of their narrow interests, 
they are usually very boring company. Indeed, they quickly discover that 
the people who cultivated them when they were in service now run a mile to 
avoid them.
    
More than the drop in the standard of living it is the loss of status and 
power that retired civil servants cannot come to terms with. After all, it 
is not easy to be preparing the national budget one day, and suddenly 
trying to cope with the household budget the next. This is why senior civil 
servants fawn and crawl to somehow get an extension when they turn 60. In 
fact, the last few months of their career are spent in desperate (and often 
embarrassing) attempts to secure some official assignment. At the Secretary 
level, income is not an issue. Status is. The value of the right to walk 
into the VIP lounge at the airport cannot be quantified, but those used to 
this privilege will kill to keep it.
    
Indeed, many of the perks available in the higher echelons of the 
bureaucracy have no money value, but so completely spoil those who have 
them that they simply cannot adapt to real life. For instance, most civil 
servants I know have never stepped into a bank, a post office or an airline 
reservation office; these simple but time-consuming tasks are performed by 
flunkies. An official passport assures you a visa, and official number 
plates will let you park anywhere you like. Above all, official status 
gives you the priceless right to jump most queues. So while you may not 
earn as much as a senior executive in the private sector, your many perks 
insulate you from the grind of daily life in Pakistan.
    
After years of ever-increasing power and privilege, re-entry into civilian 
life can be traumatic. Many civil servants age visibly on retirement. Their 
stride loses its spring; their swagger is replaced by weariness; and their 
arrogance is suddenly subdued. Now, they are willing and eager to talk to 
all those they cold-shouldered. With nothing to do at home but nag their 
long-suffering wives, they park themselves in the offices of junior ex-
colleagues, drink endless cups of tea and talk for hours about their past 
bureaucratic triumphs. Unsurprisingly, their audience shrinks very quickly.
    
With no focus or purpose to their lives, with no hobbies or interests to 
fill their days productively, retired people tend to go into terminal 
decline. There are numerous studies correlating longevity to intense mental 
activity. I regret to report that politicians, in particular, are prone to 
live very long lives, not because they exercise their grey cells unduly, 
but due to the fact that there is no retirement age in politics. But the 
years sit heavily on those who have nothing to occupy their minds. Many 
people suddenly acquire piety as a substitute for power, cynics think they 
become born-again fundos to guarantee a corner plot for themselves in 
Heaven. Be that as it may the incidence of unkempt beards seems to be 
greater among retired civil servants than ordinary mortals.
    
Although the government has made a provision for those wishing to retire 
before they turn 60, hardly anybody has taken advantage of this facility. 
Like leeches clinging to their host, bureaucrats hang on to their official 
perks until the very last day, hoping against hope that they will get a 
reprieve. The prayers of a chosen few are answered, and their assiduous 
toadyism pays off in the shape of an extension or a contract. But because 
they owe their fleeting reincarnation in the bureaucracy to their political 
masters, they become their creatures, bartering away their souls in a 
Faustian bargain. Since a contract can be cancelled or not renewed, these 
superannuated civil servants, haunted by insecurity, tender no advice that 
may annoy those in power. In effect, they lose whatever spine or principles 
they might once have possessed.
   
To all intents and purposes, they are marionettes manipulated by those who 
gave them a reprieve.
    
To some extent, one can sympathise with their plight: at 60, most people 
are mentally and physically active and alert, and should not be condemned 
to a life of inactivity. But in a sense, it is the fault of this particular 
category for not having any interests outside their careers. In other 
countries, their counterparts look forward to retirement so that they can 
devote their time to their hobbies.
    
So when you hear of some civil servants soldiering on, selling their 
independence for another year or two in harness, dont be too harsh in your 
judgement of these time servers.

<a name="ahan">A handbag on the warpath</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

MRS THATCHER was supposed to have a deadly handbag. It struck out at 
everything within sight. Something of the sort we are seeing in Islamabad 
these days. There is no rational explanation otherwise for the fights this 
government is picking. Reactionary forces, says the Prime Minister, are out 
to get her. If the truth was known, it is only her own capacities which are 
finally catching up with her.
    
At the beginning of this year everything seemed fine with Ms Bhuttos 
government. Admittedly, it was not doing too wonderful a job in office. 
Agreed also that the economic situation was grim. But in political terms at 
least there was no discernible threat that the government was facing. Yet 
six months down the road, not only has the Prime Minister seen to it that 
her government is embroiled in a thicket of wholly unnecessary 
controversies. Like a commander who has lost sight of the wood for the 
trees, she is making her own predicament worse by refusing to keep her 
handbag by her side.
    
What does Lucratius say of the man who to escape his restlessness rushes to 
and fro? Before all else, he counsels, (he should) seek to understand 
the nature of things. Instead of trying to understand the nature of her 
troubles, Benazir Bhutto is detecting conspiracies in every corner.
    
It is useless at this stage to say that she should not have sought a 
confrontation with the judiciary or that she should not have deliberately 
provoked the Chief Justice. Those deeds having been committed, there is no 
use in crying over them. Even so, little purpose is served by reinforcing a 
bad policy as Ms Bhutto seems bent upon doing. The Supreme Court restores 
the local bodies and just a day later the Punjab provincial assembly 
revokes the very law from which the local bodies derive their sustenance. 
To add insult to injury, the PPPs wise in Punjab, Malik Mushtaq Awan (the 
very person for whose daughter special arrangements were made when she was 
recently to sit for an examination) comes on television and says that this 
step has been taken in order to make the local bodies set-up more 
democratic.
    
As for the Prime Minister, who has developed a knack for delivering herself 
of unnecessary statements, she has gone on record as saying that the 
judiciary should remain neutral and that it should not play in the hands of 
a particular political grouping. As if this was not enough, she went on to 
add that this political grouping had offered to the judiciary that if it 
were to act against the government, it (that is, the judiciary) would be 
rewarded with the highest offices in the land. What is anyone to say of 
this? When rulers feel cornered they start saying things which have little 
relation with reality or logic. When Zulfikar Ali Bhutto lost the political 
initiative in 1977 he started delivering all kinds of wild statements: 
going to the Fawara Chowk in Rawalpindi and speaking of the conspiracies 
afoot to unseat his government and then making that memorable gesture of 
touching his chair and saying that his kursi was strong.
    
It is just not the budget or the firing on the Jamaat demonstration in 
Rawalpindi which are responsible for the plight of the government. A 
government sure of itself could have handled the reaction to an unpopular 
budget. An administration with steadier nerves would have handled the 
Jamaat protest in a more sensible manner. It is the confrontation with the 
judiciary which is now into its third month which has spread the impression 
that this government does not know what it is doing. And it is the pretty 
estate in Surrey (reports of which the government has not been able to 
effectively deny) which has sapped the moral authority of the government. 
Power is at its most effective when it comes coupled with moral 
incorruptibility. 
   
Not that the leading lights of this government had built any enviable 
record for themselves as far as corruption is concerned. Indeed, the line 
between public office and private advantage has been completely blurred in 
Pakistan. Still, Surreyhouse has a tangible form, which people can see and 
touch, which mere rumour and innuendo do not. The leading lights of this 
government can deny everything. They can demand proof for every allegation 
of wrongdoing. But how do they erase the impression of Surreyhouse from the 
public mind?
    
There is no grand conspiracy at work which has brought all these elements 
of destruction together. The crisis with the judiciary has been of Ms 
Bhuttos own making. The elements did not ask her to seek a fight with a 
Chief Justice whom she herself had favoured by elevating him over the heads 
of colleagues senior to him. It was hubris and nothing else which was 
behind her anger when she saw that the Chief Justice (in the matter of Agha 
Rafiq who thus enters the history books) was not doing her bidding. But 
even when the worst was over she could have helped contain the damage had 
she not behaved in what can only be called a juvenile manner after the 
Supreme Court verdict in the judges case. But she lost no opportunity in 
berating and even ridiculing the judiciary. And now to crown everything 
comes the charge that a certain political grouping (no marks for guessing 
which one) had made the offer of high political offices to the judiciary if 
it helped in removing this government. Verily, whom the gods wish to 
destroy they first make them ridiculous.
    
It is easy enough to say that something is wrong with the air of Islamabad. 
It breeds arrogance in whoever comes to occupy its high perches. The 
setting of Islamabad, the circumstance that it can hardly be called a 
Pakistani city, and the mock grandiosity of its hideous architecture, are 
certainly responsible for pushing rulers so far away from reality that they 
no longer have any understanding of how the rest of the country, or at 
least ordinary people, may be feeling. But that is not the whole story.
    
There is something ingrained in our character which makes all of us, 
especially our rulers, impatient of restraint. With us power is properly 
appreciated as power if it can be exercised arbitrarily. To question power 
or even to say that the exercise of power must be regulated by law is akin 
to the greatest sacrilege. In this the highest officials of the Republic 
are at one with the SHO and the patwari. Question an SHO as to why he is 
doing a certain thing (like not registering an FIR or implicating someone 
in a false case) and his amazement if not his anger will be unrestrained. 
The same holds true for higher officials.
    
But while touching theoretical heights, more pedestrian considerations 
should not be forgotten. 

Ms Bhutto is a politician of some strengths and many weaknesses. She has 
energy and a quick intelligence. And she is a doughty fighter. But 
throughout her political career she has given few signs of possessing those 
qualities which come under the rubric of wisdom and vision. While having an 
eye, and often a sharp one, for smaller things, she misses out on the 
larger picture. What is her government about? What were ever its 
priorities? Apart from a string of meaningless cliches, has she or anyone 
close to her ever come around to answering these questions? 
   
It is no accident that she is surrounded by mediocrities and charlatans. 
They tell her what she likes to hear. Anyone else, with intelligence and 
judgement and the integrity to speak his or her mind, would just not 
survive in her company.
    
It is worth pointing out at this juncture that it is only so much that a 
person can learn on the job. Wisdom, intelligence, integrity are not 
qualities that one can just pick up along the way. Mostly (although not 
always) one either has them or one does not. Prior to 1988 there was 
nothing in Benazir Bhuttos political record that could make anyone think 
that she would scale the heights of political performance as prime 
minister. As expected she made a hash of things. When she became prime 
minister again she was still the same person who had spawned an era of 
corruption and mismanagement during her first term. Her first government 
was chaotic and visibly so. Her second government is no less chaotic in its 
functioning. The only difference is that greater care has been taken of 
appearances. In other words, the same thing with better make-up.
    
Had Benazir Bhutto only been able to keep the hubris which lies in wait for 
all Pakistani rulers in check, there is no reason why she should not have 
been able to complete her term comfortably. After all, there was no 
immediate threat she was facing. The opposition was strong but it was not 
posing too many problems. Inflation was at an all-time high but even this 
the people were reconciling themselves to. Indeed, at the beginning of this 
year even hardened conspiracy theorists were coming round to the view that 
here was a government safely ensconced in office till the next elections.
    
But come March, traditionally a fateful month for Pakistani politics, and 
all these safe conclusions began gradually to unravel. First the row with 
the judiciary which the Prime Minister spared no effort to fan into a 
raging fire. Then as if to prove Shakespeare right that when troubles come 
they come not in single file but in battalions, Surreyhouse. Then through 
Mr Jafareys wisdom, the budget. Then through the administrations 
coolness, the Jamaat demonstration with its tally of four dead. And then 
the Supreme court judgement restoring the local bodies. The Wattoo case is 
soon to be heard in the Lahore High Court. It is anyones guess how it will 
turn out. 
   
What is plain, however, is the governments predicament. It is hemmed in 
from all sides. Far from trying to understand this situation or trying to 
understand the nature of things, Ms Bhutto continues to be in a combative 
mood. Doughtiness is a great quality but only if it is accompanied with 
good judgement. Otherwise it is only another name for misguided obstinacy.

<a name="atla">Atlanta challenge highly demanding</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

KARACHI July 2: Mansoor Ahmed, the first-ever Pakistani goalkeeper to lead 
the hockey team in the Olympic Games, said here this afternoon that the 
selected squad is a balanced side and it is getting into rhythm to launch 
its assault at Atlanta for winning back the title.
    
Talking to Dawn, Mansoor of Pakistan Customs, stated the Atlanta Olympic 
tournament is more challenging and formidable as compared to the 1992 
Barcelona Olympics as the national hockey has gone through crisis on the 
eve of the summer games. Pakistan secured third position in the last 
Olympics when there had been no crisis and the side went to Barcelona with 
the best preparations, he pointed out.
    
The weather at Atlanta , where the Olympic Games start on July 19, would be 
warm similar to Karachis and would also be suited to Pakistan and India 
and not the European teams, he said. We have played at Atlanta about three 
months back and Pakistan won the six-nation tournament with India finishing 
at number two,added the captain.
    
Mansoor Ahmed, making his third successive appearance in the Olympic Games 
starting with the 1988 Seoul Olympics, further stated that the recently-
concluded two four-nation tournaments in England and the Netherlands, have 
further provided an opportunity to the team to assess its shortcomings and 
to overcome them.
    
We went through hard competitions and it was the second time after the 
Berlin Champions Trophy following the 1994 Sydney World Cup that we 
competed against the strong European teams, he added.
    
The Olympic skipper, with 215 international caps to his belt, said Pakistan 
stands a fairly good chance to earn semi-final berth from its six -team 
pool which included defending champions Germany, India, Spain, Argentina 
and hosts United States of America.
    
The other team to enter the semi-final would be Germany. From the other 
pool Australia and the Netherlands are considered favourites to reach the 
semi-finals, stated the Olympic captain
    
The Pakistan squad, he said , is scheduled to fly to Canada for a four-
match series against the national team at Vancouver before proceeding to 
Atlanta on July 9. We would be having two weeks for our final tune-up for 
the Olympic Games and he said the team would click to produce its best to 
qualify for the semi-finals. The battle in the penultimate round would be 
more tough and hard and if we did not miss the chances Pakistan should 
reach the final for an eye on the gold medal, emphasised Mansoor Ahmed.
    
The teams main schemer is Olympian inside right Tahir Zaman and also extra 
responsibility lies on the shoulder of centre forward Kamran Ahsraf and 
inside left Mohammad Shahbaz in the Pakistan attack to make it lethal and 
effective in terms of getting goals. They are fully capable of breaking any 
defensive network, he added.
    
When questioned about the absence of former Pakistan captain Shahbaz Ahmed 
who did no make himself available for the team, Mansoor preferred to 
refrain from making any comment, saying we are concentrating on the final 
build-up of the team for the upcoming challenge at Atlanta.
    
To another question about the poor convertibility of penalty corners, the 
Olympic captain admitted that our rate of conversion certainly needs 
improvement. Now at the Atlanta battle , the skipper stated, we would be 
relying more on direct hits rather than on the indirect ones. He mentioned 
that Danish Kalim along with Naveed Alam would be used most for conversion 
purposes.
    
Mansoor disclosed that Dutch Bert Bunnik, the trainer, who joined the 
Olympic squad, this morning carried the penalty corner exercises at the HCP 
Stadium and gave valuable technical tips in conversion of penalty corners.
    
When further questioned about rejecting the rightful claim of Mohammad 
Anis, basically a left-winger who, also as centre forward gave a fine 
performance on the European tour but surprisingly Nadeem, (ND) who was not 
even in the eight standbys of the Olympic squad, was selected Mansoor 
replied that Anis should not be disheartened. He is young and fine attacker 
and has a bright future, said Mansoor.
    
The captain said Centre forward Kamran Ashraf, who toured Europe nursing 
his knee injury, has fully recovered and has started his trainings. Kamran 
has been out of practice for about a month when he injured his knee in a 
practice match at the Pakistan Customs Complex.
    
Mansoor said that the Atlanta challenge is highly demanding and the team 
would give its best to come up to the expectations of the nation which is 
looking forward to see us return home victorious.

<a name="shah">Shahbaz axed from hockey team for Olympics</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LAHORE, June 29: Former captain Shahbaz Ahmad Senior has been finally 
dropped from the 16-member Pakistan hockey team chosen on Saturday for the 
26th Olympic Games to be held at Atlanta from July 19 to Aug 4.
  
Shahbaz Ahmad led the Pakistan team to victory in the 6th World Cup hockey 
at Sydney and the Champions Trophy at Lahore in 1994. He along with other 
23 national players had refused to appear in the national trials at Karachi 
for the selection of Pakistan team for the two four-nation competitions. He 
has been replaced by Mohammad Nadeem (ND), who had been specially flown to 
Holland for the back-to-back four-nation tournament along with Mohammad 
Asif Khan on the request of manager Samiullah to reinforce the Pakistan 
team badly beaten in the first tournament at Milton-Keynes (England).
  
A Press release issued by Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) Secretary Col. 
Mudassar Asghar says: The national selectors (Akhtar Rasool and Mir 
Zafarullah Jamali) touring with the national hockey team on its twin 4-
nation tournaments after detailed discussions with manager Samiullah and 
coach Jahangir Butt have decided the 16-member hockey team for the 
Olympics. Player Mohammad Nadeem was included after thorough discussions as 
player Shahbaz Ahmad had declined at the last-minute to accompany the team 
on twin 4-nation tournaments.
  
The PHF Secretary has also announced that Bert Bunnik would be the video 
operator for the Olympic Games. He is a FIH trainer and would also 
supervise physical training of the players during the national camp at 
Karachi.

The Pakistan Olympic Association had asked the PHF to finally provide the 
names of the 16 players who would take part in the Atlanta Olympics latest 
by June 29 so that those could be sent to the Games Organising Committee 
before July 5. That has been set as the last date for submission of the 
names of all the sportsmen and officials to the Organising Committee by all 
the National Olympic Committees.
 
The following are the 16 players of the Pakistan hockey team:
 
Goalkeepers: Captain Mansoor Ahmad and Khalid Mahmood, Full-backs: Mohammad 
Danish Kaleem, Naveed Alam, Rana Mujahid Ali. Half-backs: Mohammad Usman, 
Mohammad Khalid, Mohammad Shafqat, Irfan Mahmood. Forwards: Vice-captain 
Tahir Zaman, Kamran Ashraf, Mohammad Shahbaz Junior, Mohammad Sarwar, Aleem 
Raza, Mohammad Nadeem (ND), Rahim Khan. Manager: Samiullah. Coach: Jahangir 
Butt.

<a name="brib">Bribery, match-fixing on ICC agenda</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, June 29: The International Cricket Council (ICC) is trying to rake 
up the dead bribery and match-fixing controversy and has put the issue as 
one of the items on the agenda of its annual meeting at Lords to be held 
on July 9 and 11.
    
According to sources, the ICC will be seeking its members views to form a 
sub-committee to investigate and report in detail the incident that 
reportedly occurred during Australias tour of Pakistan in 1994-95. 
Allegations were levelled against Salim Malik by Shane Warne, Tim May and 
Mark Waugh five months after the completion of the series.
    
The approval of the members is being seen as just a formality by the 
sources who maintained that the ICC has already taken the opinion of at 
least four cricket boards supporting the supreme body along with Australian 
Cricket Board (ACB) and the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB).
    
The ICC Chairman, Sir Clyde Walcott, and Chief Executive, David Richards, 
have already been empowered to constitute a committee to probe and tackle 
the issue which rocked the international cricket early last year, sources 
said.
    
The members in the committee, likely to be three with a convenor, will be 
proposed by the two ICC officials and the other members will be requested 
to unanimously approve them, sources added.
    
The Chief Executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Majid Khan, was 
taken aback when asked about the ICC intentions regarding bribery and 
match-fixing.
    
The ICC must be worried because match-fixing has crept into sports like 
football and snooker. I think, in the meeting there will be discussions how 
to keep cricket away from these ungamely things, Majid said from his 
Lahore residence.
    
The former Test opener said he wasnt sure if the deliberations would be 
directed towards the Pakistan-Australia series. I personally feel, the 
discussions will be held to generalise the overall situation.
    
However, if it came to Pakistan, well, then we will handle the situation 
accordingly, Majid stated.</pre>
