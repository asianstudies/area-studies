WASHINGTON, Feb 15: The State Department indicated that no decision 
had yet been taken by the US to start shipment of arms worth $368 
million to Pakistan, authorised by the Brown amendment.

The State Department comment came after reports in Washington Post and 
Washington Times that US may not ship these arms in view of the 
transfer of nuclear technology to Pakistan by China.

Spokesman Nick Burns told the regular briefing that US had not yet 
made decision to ship these arms to Pakistan. We want to continue our 
discussions with the Congress and with the Government of Pakistan.
    
At a separate news conference John Holum, director of the US Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency said the US government has set no 
deadline for deciding whether to impose sanctions on China, suspected 
of selling nuclear technology to Pakistan, adds AFP.

If an ongoing investigation determines the illegal technology transfer 
occurred, Washington will do what the US law requires based mainly 
on proliferation considerations, he said.

The US law requires automatic economic sanctions against any country 
violating the nuclear non-proliferation Treaty, but the president can 
lift the sanctions if justified by national interest. He can make that 
decision only upon the recommendation of the secretary of state.

PESHAWAR, Feb 15: Foreign intelligence agencies in Peshawar have 
mounted a desperate hunt to arrest Aimal Kansi following intelligence 
reports about his presence inside Afghanistan. They are in a close 
liaison with their Pakistani counterparts to catch the most wanted 
fugitive who carries a prize money of two million dollars which would 
be given to a person whose information could lead to his arrest, Dawn 
has learnt from highly placed sources.
    
An official at the US embassy in Islamabad confirmed reports of 
Kansis presence in Afghanistan while talking to Dawn, and said a 
clandestine operation was in the offing for his arrest.

<a name="alta">Altaf Hussains expulsion</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Anjum Niaz

ISLAMABAD, Feb 18: As a follow-up to Pakistans renewed request for 
the expulsion of Mohajiir Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussian from 
London, Britain is sending its Minister of State in the Foreign 
Office, Jeremy Hanley, to study the Karachi situation and hold 
important meetings with the Sindh government officials and MQM 
leaders.

The minister who comes to Pakistan for the first time, will spend two 
days in Karachi and study the law and order situation in the backdrop 
of disturbances in the metropolis.
    
Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar had told Dawn last month that 
Pakistan had despatched fresh evidence of Altaf Hussains involvement 
in terrorism.

It may be mentioned that Michael Howard had indicated to journalists 
that Britain did not have enough convincing evidence to expel Altaf 
Hussain.

<a name="ustu">US turns down MQM leaders asylum plea</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 15: An imprisoned MQM leader Kunwar Khalid Younus who was 
on his way back to prison from a court, requested the police escort to 
stop at the US Consulate General and sought political asylum. He 
surrendered to the police when his plea was turned down.
    
However, Mr Younus was conveyed assurances given by the interior 
minister Naseerullah Babar to the US ambassador, Thomas W. Simons Jr. 
that he would not be tortured or killed in custody.
    
A crisis struck the US consulate in the afternoon when the former MNA 
who was being driven to prison from the Special Terrorist Court 
requested for the prison van to be stopped at the consulate entrance, 
saying he wanted to return some library books.
    
Once inside, Mr Younus who is being tried in 71 criminal cases, told a 
consulate officer that his life was in danger. Later, he told US 
consul general, Mary Virginia Kennedy, of his fears.
    
However, to end the crisis, the US ambassador spoke to the interior 
minister and informed him about the fears expressed by Khalid Younus. 
Later, the interior Minister rang up the Sindh Governor, Kamal Azfar.
    
Mr Azfar also spoke to the consul general and assured her that the 
former MNA would not be tortured or killed in custody.
    
After assurances from the government functionaries, the former MNA 
surrendered himself to the police. He was nervous and reluctant to 
surrender himself, a witness told Dawn.
    
I went inside to lodge my protest. To protest against the massacre of 
innocent people. I have been assured that the oppression of Mohajirs 
will not continue. Tomorrow is a new day.

<a name="eigh">Eight MQM men killed: police claim encounter</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 16: Eight Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) workers were 
killed and two others suffered injuries when police stormed a house in 
a congested neighbourhood of Orangi Town.

Police claimed that the house was raided after reports that some 
terrorists were gathering there to carry out terrorist activity.
    
In the gunbattle, which according to police lasted one hour, two key 
MQM workers Hassan Akhtar and Atif Ghori wanted in dozens of murders 
cases, died with their six companions.
    
They were identified as Mustaqeem, Mohammad Yaqoob, Nazir Ahmed, 
Mohammad Salim, Mohammad Farooq and Shahid.
    
Two of their companions  Aejaz Ahmed and Ishtiaq  were wounded and 
admitted to Civil Hospital.
    
All the eight killed were in their 20s and had received multiple 
bullet wounds.
    
Head Constable Mehmoodul Aziz, police claimed, was also wounded. He 
was hit in the thigh. The search of the house, they said, yielded two 
AK-47 rifles, a .22 rifle, three pistols, a mouser, a revolver and 
some bullets.
    
Among the eight dead, police accused only Hasan Akhtar of being 
involved in over two dozen murders. A police handout sent to newspaper 
offices remained silent about the past record of the remaining seven 
deceased.
    
During the month, 25 MQM activists have been killed in alleged 
encounters with the police and rangers, raising the years toll of 
such deaths to 51.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="fore">Forex reserves swell to $1.8b</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

MULTAN, Feb 18: Minister of State for Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin has 
said the national foreign exchange reserves have increased to the tune 
of $ 1.8 bn.
    
Makhdoom Shahabuddin said the economy has been put on the right track, 
and the general growth rate is expected to be at the level of 8.2 % by 
the end of current financial year while the deficit of the budget is 
being reduced to the level of 4.8 % from the existing 5.6 %.
    
About the steps being taken for arresting the increasing trend of the 
inflation, he said at present it is 7 % which has been brought down 
from 13 % in December and 15 % in October last.
    
The foreign capital influx has shown a healthy trend as during the 
first half of the current fiscal year these were recorded to 450 to $ 
500 million, he said, adding the Karachi Stock Exchange during January 
and early February showed a tremendous recovery of its falling share 
values.
    
He said during the first half of the fiscal year, the overall exports 
showed increase of 7 % although, the achievement is much less than 
that of the target.
    
He observed the role of the government has been left to monitor the 
rates and tariffs besides running the affairs in the essential 
sectors.

<a name="deva">Devaluation fails to reverse falling exports</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed

DESPITE the increasing efforts of the government and its several 
conferences with exporters to boost the sagging exports, figures for 
the first seven months of the current financial year ending January 
show a fall in exports of 4.3 per cent against the targeted export 
growth of 14 per cent, and rise of the trade deficit to 2.25 billion 
dollars.

The staggering deficit is larger than the targeted deficit of $ 2.04 
billion for the whole year, and double the deficit for the same period 
last year. That happened not only because of the fall in exports but 
also the sharp rise in imports in the same seven-month period which 
was 18 per cent against the targeted rise of 10.6 per cent for the 
whole year.
    
The fall in exports and increase in the trade deficit have been steady 
since the beginning of this financial year. The trade gap increased to 
$1 billion in the first quarter of this year when the main items of 
exports dropped by 8.3 per cent. By the end of the second quarter on 
December 31 the gap widened to $2 billion. And if the present trend 
persists with year may end with a deficit of $3.0-3.5, billion dollars 
and swell the total deficit in the total balance of payments to 5 to 
six per cent of the GDP (as in 1992-93 when the balance of payments 
deficit peaked to 6.4 per cent of the GDP as against the targeted 
deficit of 4.1 per cent.
    
As a major measure to reverse the declining trend of exports, the 
rupee was devalued by 7 per cent on October 28, 1996, which marked a 
total 10 per cent devaluation since the June 14 budget. And three 
months have passed since that substantial devaluation, and yet its 
impact has not been felt on the export earnings of many major and 
minor items. The only significant improvement has been in the area of 
cotton whose output is estimated at 10.5 million bales leaving over 2 
million bales for exports. But the All Pakistan Textile Mills 
Association is objecting to liberal exports and seeking all kinds of 
checks to force down cotton prices which the growers and their local 
lobby led by Makhdoom Shah Mahmaud Qureshi will not accept.
    
What has happened has not come as surprise at all. In 1993, within two 
weeks, Nawaz Sharif government and the caretaker regime of Moeen 
Qureshi, too, devalued the rupee by 10 per cent and described it as 
one-time measure, and yet 1993-94 ended with a fall in exports of 2 
per cent. Worse may happen this time unless effective remedial steps 
are taken by the government in full cooperation with the exporters who 
have to play a very fair game.
    
What is remarkable is that while export earnings increased by 16.7 per 
cent last year due not to the increase in the volume of goods exported 
but due to rise in prices of the exports, the same trend is persisting 
this year as well, except that while the export prices have increased, 
the volume of goods, not excluding minor items like fish and 
vegetables, has fallen. And now the government which had spoken of 
exporting water to the Gulf despite the acute shortage of water in 
Karachi, is proposing to export Reti and Bajri to Bangladesh, Maldives 
etc. to earn little sums at the cost of the harassed house-builders of 
Karachi.
    
Despite such strong negative trends in exports, the chairman of the 
Export Promotion Bureau mian Habibullah, is confident the export 
targets for the current year will be met.

The EPB has become too much of show place busy with arranging trade 
exhibitions in a hurry all over the world and putting up poor shows. 
In fact, too many of the EPB officials are busy fly out to such shows 
abroad and they have little time to focus on the problem of falling 
exports and removing deterrents to their growth. According to EPB 
sources its vice-chairman Abu Shahmim Arif made 27 foreign trips in 
1994-95 with too little to show in terms of growth in exports target 
for which for the current year was recently scaled down from $ 9.2 
billion to 8.88 billion and yet the exports are far below the 
schedule.

What is obvious is that the ready recourse to devaluation of the rupee 
will neither boost exports in big way nor dampen the imports 
substantially.

<a name="nolo">No local taxes for power projects</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Feb 17: The government has decided to exempt the private 
power projects from provincial and local government taxes in order to 
protect the final consumers from pass-through escalation in power 
tariffs.
    
Since the matter comes under the purview of provincial autonomy, the 
directive for the exemption is proposed to be circulated among the 
provinces/local governments in the form of an advisory.
    
However, if provincial governments levy any tax then as per 
implementation agreement it will be treated as a pass-through item in 
the tariff to be absorbed by WAPDA/KESC and accordingly the final 
tariff will be increased, officials explained.
    
In order to avert such a situation, the private power investment board 
initially made two recommendations:
    
* WAPDA/KESC may be allowed to increase the tariff automatically in 
the form of additional surcharge equivalent to tax levied by the 
provincial/local government, passing on the additional burden of 
increased taxes to consumers without seeking prior approval of 
competent authority.
    
* A mechanism be evolved for the deduction from the budget allocation 
granted to the concerned province/local body responsible for levy of 
local taxes.
    
However, after consulting law, finance and planning and development 
ministries a proposal has been finalised according to which 
provinces/local bodies will be discouraged from imposing fresh 
taxes/levies on private power projects, because the bulk tariff 
offered by the government had no such provision.

<a name="inde">Index down 39.46 points</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 18: Stocks fell across a broad front as technically-
inspired selling dominated the scene, pushing the index sharply down 
by 39.46 points.

The index was initially down by about 8 points on massive early 
selling in the pivotals but mid-session revival of demand at the fall 
enabled the index to recoup a half of the initial fall.
    
The KSE 100-share index was last quoted around 1,817.76 as compared to 
1,855.22 and there are fears that it could again breach the 1,800-
point owing to Eid-holiday inspired selling from jobbers and bargain-
hunters.
    
There is a perception and shared by all leading analysts that the 
market could take a breather after consolidating its current run-up 
around 2,000 points and from that level it could move either-way 
depending background news.
    
Profit-taking was evident on all the counters but the worst-hit were 
some of the overvalued shares, notably ICI Pakistan, Engro Chemicals, 
Highnoon, Searle Pakistan, and Pakistan Gun, which showed fall ranging 
from Rs 3 to 5.
    
All leading auto shares followed them, falling by Rs 1.50 to 2.25 for 
Honda-Atlas, Indus Motors, and Pak-Suzuki Motors.
    
Bank shares also fell under the lead of Al-Faysal, Askari, Bank of 
Punjab and Prime Bank, but falls were modest and reflected stray 
selling.
    
Energy shares showed mixed trend, while National Refinery, Shell 
Pakistan, and Sui Northern fell, others rose were Pakistan Oilfield 
and Pakistan Refinery.
    
Despite general selling, the market was not without some special 
features as some of the leading shares managed to put on fresh good 
gains under the lead of Parke-Davis, which shot up by another Rs 145 
to Rs 850 on news of a good final dividend of 80 per cent and reported 
shortage of the floating stock. About 2,000 shares were traded at this 
high mark for a 10-rupee share.
    
Other good gainers were led by 4th and Third ICPs, which rose by Rs 5 
to 20 followed by 6th, 13th, 15th and 17th ICP, which rose each by one 
rupee.

Millat Tractors, Cherat Papers, which rose by Rs 8 following a good 
interim and bonus shares but it was quoted spot to check speculative 
rise.
    
BOC Pakistan, Siemens Pakistan, Pak Elektron, Mitchells Fruits, and 
Pakistan Oilfields also rose by one rupee to Rs 2.
    
The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, off Rs 3 on 
18.589m shares followed by Hub-Power, lower 75 paisa on 13.239m 
shares, ICI Pakistan, off Rs 3.25 on 0.889m shares, Kohinoor Energy, 
up 75 paisa on 0.585m shares, LTV Modaraba, easy 55 paisa on 0.588m 
shares, Lucky cement, off 65 paisa on 0.707m shares, Faysal Bank, off 
Rs 1.55 on 0.547m shares.

Other actively traded shares were led by Fauji Fertiliser up one rupee 
on 0.421 shares, Dhan Fibre, lower 25 paisa on 0.328m shares, ICP 
SEMF, off Rs 2 on 0.210m shares and Sui Northern, off Rs 3 on 0.344m 
shares. There were several other notable deals also.

Trading volume fell to 40.618m shares from the weekends 67m shares 
owing to the absence of leading sellers. There were 267 actives, out 
of which 168 shares fell, while 53 rose, with 46 holding on to the 
last levels.
    
DIVIDEND NEWS: Brooke Bond Pakistan interim dividend at the rate of 20 
per cent, Reckitt and Colman, final dividend at the rate of 23 per 
cent and bonus shares of 10 per cent.

write on the present state of our judiciary and the 1995 Judges Case 
(hearing of which recommences in the Supreme Court on March 3) she 
came across a relevant but badly composed letter written by a leader 
of the political sovereign, that is the poor masses of Pakistan, 
Benazir Bhutto, the Leader of the Opposition to My dear Prime 
Minister, Nawaz Sharif, on July 4, 1993.
    
Time frame: On April 17, 1993, Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of 
Pakistan, although enjoying a clear two-thirds majority in the 
National Assembly, very unnecessarily took on President Ghulam Ishaq 
Khan and made a stupid speech on PTV. Ghulam Ishaq sacked him the next 
day. On May 26, 1993, the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Dr 
Nasim Hasan Shah, by its historical judgment, and a majority of ten 
to one (Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, dissenting), reinstated Nawaz Sharif 
and his Assembly.
    
On July 18, 1994, Nawaz and Ghulam Ishaq were forced to resign by the 
supreme power that emanates from the barrel of a gun. Caretaker Moeen 
Qureshi took over on July 19. Free and fair elections were held, on 
October 6 for the National assembly and on October 9 for the 
Provincial Assemblies. On October 19, 1993, Benazir Bhutto was sworn 
in as Prime Minister.
    
Reproduced hereunder are some interesting and relevant paragraphs from 
Benazirs July 4, 1993, letter to My dear Prime Minister:
    
I write to you at an anguished moment in our countrys history whilst 
the spectre of chaos, confusion and controversy threatens to destroy 
our political structures and plunge our nation, its people, economy 
and way of life into the darkest depths of despair....
    
It is no use denying that a deep political crisis exists and that 
legal remedies sought so far have failed to bring back stability...
    
We in the Pakistan Peoples Party had proposed in June 1993 a three-
point formula for resolving the present crisis:
    
1) Formation of a national government.
    
2) Package of constitutional reforms.
    
3) Date for fresh elections.
    
From the formation of a national government to the date for fresh 
elections we envisage a three-month period whereby general elections 
may take place by the autumn of this year.
    
We had hoped that negotiations between Government and Opposition 
would bear fruit. Unfortunately, PDA-Government talks have broken down 
with the Government being unable to signal its goodwill through some 
small measures that were being required to end political and economic 
victimisation...
    
If, as in the past, you once again dismiss the call for immediate 
elections, then I am afraid Pakistan will only see further instability 
and the responsibility for the consequences will be with the 
Government.
    
If that is how you wish to govern for as long as you can eke out, 
then that is the nations misfortune. We in the Opposition would be 
left with no other option but to go directly to the people and 
mobilise their strength in seeking a solution based on the three-point 
formula.
    
Elections alone will be a partial solution. the preferred solution is 
one with constitutional reforms so that an elected government may 
govern in peace while the Opposition may perform its functions in 
equal peace, knowing that it will get a fair chance in due course. 
That means:
    
1) Electoral Reforms: The election process lies at the heart of a 
democratic polity. As the sitting government has the administration at 
its disposal, we propose that the Chief Election Commissioner should 
be nominated by the leader of the Opposition. Other reforms in the 
electoral process, including elimination of ID Card alone as a form of 
identification, to be mutually discussed.
    
2) Political Parties Act be reformed to end the scourge of 
blackmailing, bribery and horse-trading. A simple letter from the 
Leader of the Parliamentary party concerned should be sufficient to 
de-seat a member unless 30 per cent of the group decide to defect 
together.
    
3) Appointment of Chief Justices of the Supreme Court and High Courts 
be done by mutual agreement of the Leader of the House and Leader of 
the Opposition to ensure that the judiciary is seen to be fair.
    
4) Appointment of Service Chief be left to the discretion of the 
President so that the Forces are free from the fray of political life 
and the vagaries of government.
    
5) Appointment of Governors by mutual agreement between the Leader of 
the Opposition and Leader of the House to ensure that provincial 
autonomy is not violated by a sitting federal government through the 
governor.
    
6) Appointment of Judges of superior judiciary by a parliamentary 
committee.
    
7) Restoration of womens seats to the National Assembly, restoration 
of joint electorate, and lowering of the voting age to 18 years.
    
8) Extending the right of adult franchise to the Tribal Areas and 
evolving a system of self-government for the Northern Areas.
    
9) Repeal of Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution.
    
10) Making Parliament sovereign for legislative purposes and reducing 
the tenure of Parliament, President and Senate to four years...
    
While the concentration of some powers in the President might make 
him powerful, the concentration of all powers, judicial, electoral, 
gubernatorial, political and legislative, in the Prime Minister would 
be extremely dangerous.
    
We must learn from our history and its mistakes to ensure that our 
proud Federation, its hard-working people and our future generations 
have a better chance, a better life, a better choice than our 
predecessors did. That can only be ensured by building a society where 
the law and the Constitution remain supreme, where the weak and the 
oppressed can change their destiny and hold their rulers accountable 
at regular intervals...
    
The attempt to revive a dead assembly through a resolution was not 
only unrealistic but unconstitutional. This has deepened our fears 
that the Federal Government is determined to seize all powers through 
fair means or foul. This apprehension needs dispelling.
    
The Army has shown remarkable restraint but it would not be wise 
policy to test their patience or the endurance of the people. It is 
not a question of power or the spoils of office, but creating a 
society which has the benefit of the rule of law and where the 
institutions are bigger than individuals. Ultimately it is not for the 
courts to decide political questions. This is the sole prerogative of 
the people of Pakistan. History will not forgive those who obstruct 
the privilege of the political sovereign, that is the poor masses of 
Pakistan, to exercise their will. Pakistans dilemma can only be 
resolved by the ballot.
    
Let the people judge.
    
Now, after 28 months of Benazirs second rule, we are once again at 
an anguished moment in our countrys history whilst the spectre of 
chaos, confusion and controversy threatens to destroy our political 
structures and plunge our nation, its people, economy and way of life 
into the darkest depths of despair.
    
I am sending a reminder copy of this letter to Nawaz Sharif, 
suggesting that he and all other leaders of the sovereign power in 
opposition, address a similar letter to My dear Prime Minister, 
Benazir Bhutto.
    
Benazir has successfully contrived to concentrate all powers, 
judicial, electoral, gubernatorial, political and legislative, unto 
herself, which situation in July 1993 she had deemed most dangerous. 
She has victimised the opposition to such an extent that she has also 
virtually achieved a one-party rule. Many of her opponents are 
jailed and are unable to obtain bail, those who are critically ill 
conveniently die in custody, and in Karachi the system of killing 
enemies of the party in power through police encounters is working 
to perfection.
    
She has horse-traded and dissolved assemblies. She has appointed her 
own Election Commissioner, her own governors, and did her best to 
appoint her own army chief but fortunately failed. She has packed our 
courts, and used the Eighth Amendment, which she abhors and wishes to 
repeal, to punish two Chief Justices by transferring them to the 
Shariat Court. Now, three of our four High Courts are presided over by 
Acting Chief Justices, who can be unseated by the issuance of a mere 
notification.
    
She appointed as the Chief Justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah 
(forgetting that he had the capacity to rightly or wrongly stand up 
alone against ten of his brothers and be counted), who now, against 
her apparent will, wishes to exercise power in terms of the oath he 
has sworn  In the Name of Allah, the most beneficent, the most 
merciful  to right the wrong and strengthen the judiciary, for which 
he and his family are being intimidated and harassed by the flunkies 
of her government.

<a name="thef">The freedom to rant</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

A STRANGE and marvellous freedom the Fourth Estate is enjoying. It can 
print what it likes: exposes, scandals, even innuendoes based upon the 
flimsiest of evidence. But for all the effect that it has it could be 
howling in the dark.
    
The press may have become more powerful since the lifting of martial 
law in 1985, or that at least is what it would like to think; but at 
the same time the world of Pakistani officialdom has acquired a 
thickness of skin that a rhinoceros would envy. More power on the one 
hand and greater insensitivity on the other thus go hand in hand.
    
The saga of the Mehran Bank; the payoffs to Aftab Sherpao which were 
then channelled into the drive to unseat the Frontier government; 
General Aslam Begs admission of having received 14 crores, no less, 
from Yunus Habib; reports of bunglings in the expected purchase of 
aircraft for the PIA; endless tales of corruption and kickbacks in 
other sectors of national life  all this and much more has appeared 
in the press. But these exposures have led to nothing: no judicial 
investigations, no prosecutions of any sort.
    
If Pakistani dictators had been blessed with the gift of foresight 
they would never have taken the trouble of trying to gag the press. 
They would not have gone through the contortions of something like the 
Press and Publications Ordinance. Instead they would have done what 
the countrys democrats have learnt to do: treat the snivellings of 
the press with a lordly disdain. How wrong the notion that the Press 
can subvert if not overthrow governments. As its current impotence 
demonstrates it can do no such thing. Nor is it accurate to call the 
press the Fourth Estate. In circumstances where even the legislature 
and the judiciary have lost a great deal of their importance and 
relevance, how can the press with its ineffectual efforts lay claim to 
any grandiloquent title?
    
This situation would be amusing if it were not sinister at the same 
time. In the past when the Pakistani nation went through one of its 
bouts of intense short-sightedness, such as during the East Pakistan 
crisis of 1971, it had a convenient alibi in dictatorship. We could 
not see because of the scales on our eyes, could not speak because of 
the locks on our tongues. That comfortable alibi can no longer be 
pressed into service. There is very little happening in the country 
which is not known, if not in detail at least in outline, with shady 
deals and other shenanigans regularly finding their way into 
newspapers. Yet nothing seems to happen as a consequence. Nor is 
anyone in authority concerned about bad publicity. The press, 
therefore, is essentially conducting a dialogue with itself. Or, at 
best, providing grist to the mills of drawing room conversation.
    
It is true that if the press is not proving to be a check on 
governmental behaviour, it is feeding public perceptions, a 
circumstance which will become important when the government will be 
obliged, as it will be at the latest by 1998, to seek a fresh mandate 
from the people. But what about the present? Does the governments 
total indifference to censure mean that Pakistani governments once 
elected can get away with anything? That, constitutional appearances 
apart, in the Pakistani political system there are no real checks and 
balances?
    
This certainly is the conclusion that flows from the present political 
scene. Despite the strong presence of the opposition in both 
legislative houses, Parliament exercises no check, not even a moral 
one, on the executives actions. It is not even a proper law-making 
body because most of the time it is rubber-stamping ordinances issued 
by the government. Mian Nawaz Sharif did not give the National 
Assembly much importance when he was prime minister. Benazir Bhutto 
too treats it with scant respect.
    
Time and again the Speaker of the National Assembly and the Chairman 
of the Senate have demanded the production of arrested MNAs or 
senators during sessions of their respective houses only to see the 
government treat their rulings with contempt. On many occasions the 
opposition has tried raising contentious issues in parliament but to 
no effect because nothing said in the National Assembly or the Senate 
has the slightest influence on the governments behaviour. This was 
true of the previous government and it is true of the present one. 
Small wonder then if parliament as a consequence has been reduced to 
little more than a cipher.
    
The courts may be the ultimate custodian of fundamental rights in a 
democracy. They also protect the sanctity of the constitution (till 
such time of course that the doctrine of necessity, of which 
Pakistan has had ample experience, does not cut short this role of 
theirs). But even with the best intentions in the world the courts, 
while able to deliver landmark judgements when important issues come 
before them for interpretation, cannot act as watchdogs of the public 
interest like parliament and the press. Nor can they become a check on 
a governments arbitrariness in a society in which there is no basic 
respect for the law.
    
In any case, the judiciary can perform its functions only when a 
matter comes before it for adjudication. In Pakistan it is a 
remarkable facet of our democracy that unless the government so wills, 
not even the gravest charges against anyone come up for prosecution. 
For example, in any other society, subject to the rule of law, General 
Aslam Beg would have faced prosecution for admitting that he took 
funds from the banker Yunus Habib while Aftab Sherpao too would have 
been investigated for receiving money from the same source. These are 
just two examples of the state of the law in Pakistan. If similar 
examples which illustrate the selectivity of Pakistani justice were 
put together they would fill a thick volume.
    
We see, therefore, the condition in which our democracy exists. When a 
government comes to power, even if it does so through honest 
elections, there are no democratic checks on its arbitrariness. It 
can do what it likes and even though it may face resistance from the 
press or parliament, this resistance amounts to little more than an 
inconvenience which, as we are seeing in the case of the present 
government, can be ignored or brushed aside easily.
    
The checks that Pakistani governments do face are of a different order 
altogether. They emanate from two quarters: the military and the 
Eighth Amendment Presidency. Every civilian government, whatever the 
lip-service it pays to the notion of deriving its power from the 
constitution and the people, is acutely conscious of the sensibilities 
of the military. The second of these two checks is tolerated with less 
grace but it has to be taken into account nonetheless. That is about 
all. There are no other checks on Pakistans democrats: none from the 
legislature or the judiciary, none from the press and certainly none 
from the exercise of moral or cultural self-restraint because this 
quality, if it ever existed, is getting rarer by the day among the 
modern products of the countrys governing class.
    
This does not mean that the press should retreat into pessimism. But 
it certainly means that it should get off its high horse and stop 
nursing delusions of grandeur. It must recognise its limitations and 
also perceive the true nature of the present democratic system which, 
if it must be given a name, could be called democratic 
authoritarianism. This is a more sophisticated system than the pure 
militarism of the Zia brand because it is conducive to the spreading 
of the benign illusion that the people (that mythical entity whose 
name has always been used for the most dubious causes) somehow matter 
and that they are masters of their destiny. Nothing could be more 
false than this idea but then this romantic nation has survived on 
myths far more florid and fantastic than this.

<a name="disi">Disincentive to investment</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

INCONSISTENCY and frequent changes in economic and taxation policies 
and lack of uniformity in their implementation have often been cited 
as some of the major factors inhibiting investment and industrial 
growth. Similar views were expressed by US Ambassador Thomas W. Simons 
at a Press conference in Karachi recently. He blamed these factors as 
being responsible for the slow pace of actualisation of several MoUs 
signed with American companies during Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's 
visit to the US. He said frequent changes, being made in the policies 
relating to investment, taxation, trade and industry, were dissuading 
businessmen  from, taking major initiatives.

Trade decisions are taken by businessmen in the form of short-term 
commitment knowing full well all the relevant conditions prevailing at 
a given time. Reversal of decisions prompted by any change in those 
conditions is comparatively easy. But longer-term relationship 
requires stability in conditions of competition if trade exchanges are 
to flourish. On the other hand, investment decisions relate to the 
future. These decisions are taken in a historical perspective of 
changes h conditions of competition or the promises made in this 
regard at the time of taking decisions. Any abrupt deviation from 
these conditions or promises affects the viability of an enterprise 
and leaves no option for the sponsors to consider withdrawal at that 
late stage. Hence, investors are apt to be extremely cautious. They 
are also guided by the past behaviour of the authorities and their 
reputation as judicious decision-makers.

In this regard, Pakistan does not have an enviable record. Decisions 
are taken hastily and incentives and concessions are offered on an ad 
hoc basis and on considerations of selective preferences. These are 
sometimes withdrawn with equal haste. A classic example is that of the 
Gadoon industrial estate where incentives were given, curtailed, 
withdrawn and restored; the whole process was repeated a number of 
times. The latest instance in point is that of special industrial 
zones where basic concessions have been withdrawn after, these had 
been in force for only nine months out of five years. In contravention 
of original terms, some basic changes in conditions relating to the 
Export Processing Zone are said to be under consideration. Following 
the recent devaluation, investors will have to pay 10 per cent 
additional (regulatory) duty on their import of capital goods if these 
were not exempt earlier or five percent if these were free of duty. 
Such decisions are sometimes made on short-term consideration of 
increased revenue generation in disregard of long-term disincentive 
effect on private sector investment. Changes have been made recently 
in quick successions in banking regulations, resulting in upward and 
downward swing of interest rates. If some changes have to be made for 
reasons of structural adjustment, enough time should be given to the 
affected parties. The industrial West will take ten years of 
adjustment to switch over from the MFA regime to free trade.

Now that the economy has been largely liberalised and deregulated and 
resources are being allowed to be allocated on considerations of 
efficiency, a level playing field has to be provided to all the new 
players in the investment game, giving them free and un-induced 
choice. However, those who are already in the game, playing under 
different conditions should be allowed to continue for the period 
specified for the purpose. This will enhance confidence in the 
government's commitment even among those who may be adversely affected 
at the moment. Investment climate should be made conducive, not 
through concessions and preferential treatment, but through 
improvements in infrastructureroads, telecommunications, water, gas 
and electricity and skilled and trained manpower. Particularly 
important for attracting investment is across-the-board reduction in 
all pre-production taxes. Loss of revenue may be made up from 
increases in post-production levies. All ploughed-back profits may be 
exempted from tax.

Mr Simons expressed concern about the law and order situation in 
Karachi and considered it a disincentive for investment. What is, 
however, encouraging is his assurance  that despite this inhibition, 
American firms interest in Pakistan has not in any way waned. Karachi 
continues to be a focus of attention and the US administration 
encourages American businesses to invest in this city. As a result, 
the Ambassador expects direct American investment of $100 million in 
the city to materialise soon. Problems of the city emanate largely 
from unemployment; private investment and the consequent creation of 
jobs can be expected to go a long way in easing the situation.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="wasi">Wasim may help restore national pride</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Paul Allott

I always thought I would be asked to lead Pakistan in the World Cup, 
said Wasim Akram, but I needed a test of character  a hard tour, to 
prepare myself. He got his wish in Australia  with a vengeance.
    
Last October Pakistan were in turmoil. They had lost their first home 
Test series for 15 years  to Sri Lanka of all people. They also lost 
the one-day series. This was bad enough but worse were lingering 
stories of betting and bribery on the earlier Australia tour of 
Pakistan. Tim May and Shane Warne alleged they had been offered huge 
sums to throw games.
    
Nothing was proved but Salim Malik was relieved of the Pakistan 
captaincy pending an investigation by the Board of Control for Cricket 
in Pakistan. Salim was then picked to tour Australia, whose Press was 
still baying for his blood.
    
It was hardly an ideal scenario for Wasim as incoming captain: poor 
results, disillusioned players, a disenchanted public at home and a 
distinctly hostile one waiting in Australia. Yet, far from flinching 
at the prospect of becoming his countrys captain and ambassador, he 
relished it.
    
Without doubt Pakistans outstanding player, Wasim was more mature 
than when he captained the side two years earlier and was usurped in a 
players coup for being too strict. He is man enough now to admit that 
he deserved it.
    
The tour of Australia ended in a Test series defeat but Wasims new-
look Pakistan won the last Test and then a one-off match in New 
Zealand. Results matter and Wasim wanted to win everything but he is 
proud to be hailed for his diplomatic achievement.
    
Before the trip Down Under I made sure that each member of the team 
realised that this was going to be a bridge-building tour. Pakistan 
were perceived very poorly in world cricket. Australia was going to be 
extraordinarily uncomfortable if we didnt make friends, with crowds 
and players alike.
    
I attempted to instil in the players the ideals of positive cricket, 
being aggressive and hard on the field but approachable and sociable 
off it. I was always first into the Australian dressing-room at close 
of play to share a cola or two with them.
    
Wasim credits his opposite number Mark Taylor for his efforts in 
turning what could have been a most unpleasant tour into a series that 
saw the tourists described as one of the friendliest teams ever to 
tour Australia.
    
He now knows that he can thrive on responsibility and that to get the 
best out of players he needs to cajole, be supportive but above all be 
honest with them. He knows also that the Lancashire players respect 
him, not just because he is an outstanding player but as a person. 
Pakistans players, after Australia, feel the same way.
    
Wasim is determined that Pakistan put up a good performance in the 
World Cup. I want emphatic wins in our first two games against New 
Zealand and Holland and I want a tough quarter-final when we qualify.
    
There is no complacency, no hiding, just a forthright call for 
success. No host nation has won the World Cup but, should Wasim Akram 
lift the trophy in Lahore next month, all Pakistan will acclaim him as 
a national hero.

<a name="mian">Miandad poised to set two records</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 : Seasoned campaigner Javed Miandad is poised to set 
two, perhaps unassailable, records during the sixth World Cricket 
Cup,96.
    
Javed Miandad will have played six World Cup tournaments while the 39 
years old greatest ever Pakistani batsman will further embellish his 
position as the most prolific batsman ever in the competitions 
history.
    
Miandad and Imran Khan were the only two cricketers to have played all 
previous five World Cups. But Miandad will go one up with his sixth 
World Cup appearance when Pakistan take on United Arab Emirates at 
Gujranwala on January 24.
    
Javed Miandad already heads the list of scorers with 1,029 runs to his 
credit in 28 World Cup matches. But he has played 27 innings, 
returning an average of 44.73 with his highest score being 103.
    
The knock of 103, coming against Sri Lanka in Pakistans first match 
at Hyderabad in 1987 World Cup, is also Javed Miandads only century 
in five World Cup Championships.

<a name="rich">Richardson pledges to win Cup</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

HYDERABAD, (India), Feb 15: Richie Richardson, the target of virulent 
criticism from the passionate but unforgiving Caribbean cricket 
community, pledged to bring the World Cup back to the West Indies.
    
Winning the World Cup is essential for the team, Richardson told 
reporters on the eve of his sides opening match against Zimbabwe.
    
Richardson has stoically endured an unhappy year, beginning with West 
Indies first series defeat for 15 years last March when the 
unofficial world champions succumbed to Mark Taylors Australians.
    
They then drew 2-2 with England in a six-test series before completing 
a miserable tour of Australians where, without Brian Lara, West Indies 
failed to qualify for the World Series one-day finals.
    
Inevitably, Richardson has been blamed for his teams failings.
    
Joel Garner and Jeff Dujon, two leading members of the great 1980s 
West Indies side, have called for his resignation.
    
And Laras absence from the Australian tour has been interpreted in 
the Caribbean and elsewhere as an expression of dissatisfaction with 
Richardsons captaincy as much as anger at a fine incurred as a result 
of incidents on the England tour.
    
A flood of runs for Lara at the sixth World Cup would not only confirm 
the Trinidadian left-handers status as the worlds leading batsman 
but also ensure a successful tournament for West Indies and 
Richardson, a paradox that will not be lost on either man.
    
Richardson, once one of the worlds most exciting batsmen, has 
struggled increasingly for form in both test and one-day cricket and 
looked badly out of touch in a warm-up match on Tuesday.
    
In common with former Antiguan team mate Viv Richards, his predecessor 
as West Indies captain, Richardson relies on reflex and instinct and 
his technical deficiencies have been cruelly exposed over the past

What Richardson does possess in abundance is character and 
determination and he may well choose to lead from the front and open 
the innings with Sherwin Campbell.

<a name="calc">Calcutta semi-final under threat</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CALCUTTA, Feb 15: Cricket officials warned on Thursday they might not 
stage the World Cup semi-final at Calcuttas Eden Gardens stadium on 
March 13 unless a row with local authorities over crowd safety was 
resolved.
    
Our confidence has been badly shaken and we are having second 
thoughts about hosting the March 13 semi-final, Cricket Association 
of Bengal (CAB) president Jagmohan Dalmiya said.
    
Local authorities have expressed concern about the safety of a new 
stand at Eden Gardens stadium that is due to increase crowd capacity 
by 10,000 to 110,000.
    
They have told the CAB it must obtain a structural safety certificate 
before it can stage the semi-final.
    
The CAB has accused the authorities of red tape and said it was 
surprised the issue had been raised because Eden Gardens staged the 
Cups opening ceremony last Sunday without any problems.
    
West Bengals Marxist state government said it would call a meeting 
with Calcutta municipal authorities to resolve the problem.

Unless we get the all clear signal in the next three or four days, we 
will not take the responsibility of holding the match, he said.
    
If the CAB declines to stage the match, the future of the semi-final 
will be in hands of the World Cup organisers, the Pakistan-India-Lanka 
Committee (PILCOM).
    
The official ruled out shifting the semi-final venue from Eden 
Gardens, saying it would place PILCOM in a difficult situation.
    
The Australian and West Indies cricket boards might make an issue out 
of any change of venue, he said.
    
PILCOM has already rejected requests from the two boards to shift 
their scheduled World Cup fixtures from Sri Lanka.

<a name="kapi">Kapil for ban on Australia, W.I.</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

NEW DELHI, Feb 16: Former Indian captain Kapil Dev has called for 
Australia and West Indies to be banned from international cricket for 
at least a year for refusing to play their World Cup matches in Sri 
Lanka because of safety fears.
    
Both these teams should not only have been thrown out of the 
competition, they should also have been barred from playing the game 
for at least one year, Kapil said.

The Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported on Thursday that 
Australia and West Indies may be fined up to $3 million each for 
forfeiting their matches in Sri Lanka.
    
It quoted Indian cricket chief Inderjit Bindra, who is a member of the 
Pakistan-India-Lanka World Cup organising committee (PILCOM), as 
saying the agreement between PILCOM and the 12 teams stipulated the 
provision of the penalty in case of their forfeiting a match.

<a name="acas">A case for the underdogs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tanvir Ahmad

A debate has started in Pakistani Press and the electronic media about 
the wisdom of the decision to include the four babes of cricket in 
the sixth edition of the World Cup. A section of cricket experts, 
including a couple of former Test cricketers, are of the opinion that 
it is not a right decision.
    
They base their argument on the premise that, firstly the four  
Holland, UAE, Kenya and Zimbabwe  are too weak sides to make their 
ties against their senior partners worth the money and secondly, that 
their inclusion may be to the disadvantage of the more serious 
contenders of the title.
    
The other day I happened to watch a programme on PTV in which 
Pakistans former opener Sadiq Mohammad was vociferously speaking 
against the inclusion of the associate members in the contest. Sadiq 
was apparently so upset that he went on to say that these teams will 
neither attract crowds nor will they make any difference to the 
outcome of the league portion of the tournament.
   
Ironically, just about when he made this comment, Holland, making 
their debut in international cricket, had captured 5 New Zealand 
wickets in Baroda. A day earlier, Zimbabwe, after being restricted to 
151 for 9 in 50 overs by a strong West Indian attack, never lost heart 
and went on to claim four West Indian wickets for 136.
    
About the interest of the spectators, one has only to remind that the 
Lal Bahadur Shastri stadium in Hyderabad had a bigger crowd than at 
any of the centres when Pakistan and Sri Lanka were playing their Test 
series in Pakistan just a few months ago. Even in a small city like 
Baroda, there was a reasonably good crowd to watch the Zimbabwe- West 
Indies tie.
    
East Africa was among the eight teams to play in the 1975 edition and 
in 1979 the Canadian team was included. And who can forget the 
sensational upset caused by Zimbabwe in the 1983 World Cup when it 
defeated a strong Australian team by 13 runs, which ultimately 
resulted in Australia failing to qualify for the semi-final. And they 
repeated the feat in 1992 again when they beat England, who ultimately 
went on to play the final against Pakistan, by 9 runs in a league 
match. 
    
Many of us would recall that some pessimists in Pakistan as well as in 
England were of the view that Pakistan was given Test status a wee bit 
early. When Pakistan toured England in 1954 and received thrashing in 
the earlier matches and the first Test the same views were expressed 
until we won at the Oval. And Zimbabwe taught the Pakistanis some 
lessons in cricket when Pakistan team toured that country last year. 
For that matter the Sri Lankans, rated behind Pakistan and India ( for 
what earthly reason one is at a loss to understand) made a clean sweep 
of the series in 1995.
     
One strongly feels that this is a somewhat negative approach towards 
the game as well as the newcomers, trying to make their place under 
the sun. They need to have more sympathetic, more positive as well as 
encouraging attitude. It will not be many years from now that UAE or 
Holland will be giving hard time to the present cricket giants.

<a name="lank">Lanka cash in on Cup silver lining</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

COLOMBO, Feb 18: Sri Lanka, boycotted by the Australian and West 
Indian sides, have discovered a silver lining to the World Cup 
controversy.
    
Sri Lankas Board of Control for Cricket is expecting to cash in on 
the sympathy vote after launching a major fund to boost local cricket 
talent.
    
I cant think of a better time to launch this, Board President Ana 
Punchihewa said. The whole world is looking at us.
    
Punchihewa received donations worth Rs. 9 million (US$180,000) from 
seven private sector firms here last week, with another dozen willing 
to support the project.
    
The Cricket Fund hopes to raise Rs.30 million (US$600,000) within the 
calendar year.
    
The Cricket Board expects to lose about Rs.5 million (US$100,000) from 
each matchs gate receipts. Losses from television rights and 
advertising have not yet been calculated.
    
The fund will finance the countrys first cricket academy, where 
youngsters with talent but no means will get training.

Hardly any work is done in offices when the Sri Lankan team plays a 
five-day test and everything comes to a virtual standstill if it is a 
nail-biting one-day international.
    
Cricket is so widespread in Sri Lanka that children can often be seen 
playing on main highways, rice fields and on sandy white beaches  
morning, noon and night.

<a name="whoh">Who has the stomach to win the cup?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The key player in the 1996 World Cup could be a high-speed strike 
bowler, a versatile all-rounder, a dashing batsman ... or a rampant 
stomach bug.
    
Sub-continental stomach trouble  better known by the generic terms 
Delhi belly or Bombay bug  has already struck several teams in 
the early stages of the competition.
    
The Dutch, always ranked outsiders going into Saturdays game with New 
Zealand, were hampered still further by a bout of illness which laid 
low seven of their players after eating a few platefuls of rogue 
spaghetti.
    
The cliched suggestion that the eventual winners of the World Cup will 
need `guts and a stomach for a fight seems suddenly ironically 
appropriate.
    
The host teams of Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka would probably reckon 
to be immune to most Asian strains of stomach trouble but the less 
acclimatised touring sides will be taking extra precautions.
    
New Zealand coach Glenn Turner  who is married to an Indian and led 
New Zealand on their tour of India in 1976  said before the cup: We 
know what to expect here. We must be wary of spin and upset stomachs.
    
In another celebrated affair three years ago, Englands Graham Gooch 
and Mike Gatting were forced to miss a Madras Test match following a 
meal of prawns and red wine the evening before.
    
Intriguingly, the English press blamed a hotel. Most Indians pointed 
the finger at the two players appetites.
