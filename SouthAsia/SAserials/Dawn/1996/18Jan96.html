<a name="defe">Defection by Punjab MPAs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Jan 14: The opposition will hand over to the Punjab Assembly 
speaker references against 11 of its legislators who are alleged to 
have changed their loyalties after being elected on PML tickets.
    
The speaker will be requested to forward these references to the Chief 
Election Commissioner for disqualification of the members concerned 
under the law.
    
The opposition legislators who have changed their loyalties have since 
been given various offices, and some of them have become ministers.
    
Those against whom references have been prepared include Chaudhry Ijaz 
Ahmed, Pir Ghulam Farid Chishti, Farrukh Javed Ghumman, Tariq Anees, 
Saleh Mohammad Ganjial, Rasool Bux Jatoi, Mansha Khan, Mian Javed 
Mumtaz Daultana and Mazhar Qureshi.

<a name="narm">N-arms to worsen tension, US tells India</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

BOMBAY, Jan 12: The United States advised India against developing 
nuclear weapons, saying it would worsen regional tensions rather than 
enhance national security.
    
Pakistan has also expressed strong concern over the possibility of the 
country conducting a nuclear test, but Delhi says it has no such 
plans.
    
US ambassador to India Frank Wisner said in a speech to business 
leaders in Bombay that the United States was acting quickly to reduce 
its own nuclear arsenal following the end of the Cold War.
    
The United States recognised that India alone can determine its own 
security arrangements, he said. When it comes to the question of 
developing nuclear weapons, however, we believe that careful 
consideration will lead to the conclusion that, rather than enhancing 
national security, such a step will simply exacerbate regional 
tensions, provoke neighbouring countries into taking similar measures, 
and ultimately lead to greater instability, he said.
    
We hope instead that India will sustain its support for the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that for so long has been a central 
element of its security policy, and that it will join us in pressing 
for an international agreement that will end the production of 
material needed to manufacture nuclear weapons, Mr Wisner added.
    
He also said, the United States wanted to see a prosperous and 
progressive India to help maintain global and regional security.

<a name="indi">India to deploy Prithvi missile</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

NEW DELHI, Jan 16: India has decided to deploy its medium-range 
Prithvi missile soon, defence officials said, fuelling Western fears 
it could be used to deliver nuclear weapons against Pakistan.

A Defence Ministry spokesman said a proposed test firing of the 
surface-to-surface missile was postponed in Orissa because of 
technical difficulties. The exact reason for the postponement was not 
known.

They said the Prithvi, capable of delivering nuclear warheads, would 
eventually be offered for export.

of the Mehran Bank, was served with another charge- sheet by Israr 
Ali, public prosecutor of the Special Court for Offences in Banks.

<a name="pris">Prisoners suffer unending trials</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Riaz

KARACHI, Jan 11: Sufferings of the under-trial prisoners knows no 
bounds. Every day scores of them shuttle between jails and the city 
courts in police vans which have all elements of a dungeon.
    
By the time they arrive at the court premises, they are in a bad 
shape. It seems they already have received their punishment. But there 
are more sufferings in store for them at the court premises where they 
must pass almost the whole day in lock-ups and trial rooms before 
returning to their prisons.
    
As their first ordeal  travelling from jails to courts  ends, the 
second begins when they are lodged in the lock-ups built in 1940 on 
the ground floor of the city courts. These lock-ups were originally 
meant for housing 100 prisoners, but now 200 to over 300 of them are 
lodged during trials. On Monday last 303 under-trial prisoners were 
huddled the four tiny rooms.
    
As many as 224 were brought from Central Jail, 48 from Landhi and 31 
from Borstal Jail. Before being ushered into the lock-ups these under-
trials had to go through an exercise at the back of the main iron gate 
where a cop writes their numbers and those of the vehicles detailed to 
fetch them daily from jails.
    
A single room can at best house 25 detainees, but generally over 100 
are pushed into it. A changed atmosphere, however, does not provide 
them a moments respite from the bane of their daily prison life.
    
Of the four rooms or lock-ups, one is occupied by the court police in 
which they keep their personal things, furniture and record-books. The 
second is used as a store for broken chairs, old clothes and other 
wastes. The third, which has an open toilet in one corner and a water 
tap in the opposite one, is perhaps meant for women detainees as a 
lone woman was seen squatting on its floor.
    
The fourth room was occupied, as mentioned above, by male prisoners.
    
Although the government is in the full knowledge of the situation, it 
has not yet, for reasons best known to it, made any effort to make it 
a place for human beings.
    
But there is one redeeming factor which takes much of the burden of 
the agonies off the mind of a prisoner. The court premises provide him 
with an opportunity to talk to a relative or two, though a small money 
is involved in this. That is, there are touts all around the premises 
who arrange a meeting between a detainee and his relatives when they 
are paid a small sum for this service.
    
Each detainee is allowed to have a lunch with his wife and children is 
charged Rs 20 by cops on guard duty, a detainee told Dawn.
    
Some detainees, sitting in the veranda, were heard speaking about 
human rights activists and NGOs who appear in media reports but have 
not yet found any time to visit the lock-ups to verify the hardships 
under-trial prisoners undergo daily.
    
Moreover, detainees have to suffer the agony of waiting. After a 
hearing is over, they have some time to wait for nothing till the 
sunset. They are kept in the lock-ups till the last of them is 
produced in the court.
    
This long wait hangs heavy on the prisoners as all of them are hand-
cuffed or in fetters.

<a name="imra">Imran wants a lawyers body to look into hospital accounts</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Jan 12: Cricketer-turn-philanthropist Imran Khan has invited a 
local lawyer, Dr Basit, to constitute a committee, comprising members 
of the Lahore High Court Bar Association of his choice, to look into 
the accounts of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital.
    
If I or any member of my family is proved to have misused the 
hospital funds I would readily transfer all my property to Shaukat 
Khanum Memorial Trust and surrender myself for imprisonment and if the 
accounts are found to be correct, Mr Basit should compensate the trust 
for the Rs 50,000,000 loss caused to its 1995 Zakat campaign by his 
case in the Lahore High Court, he said while addressing a Press 
conference at the Lahore Press Club.

Mr Khan said the trust was being run by an independent board of 
governors, comprising people of integrity like former federal finance 
minister Syed Babar Ali, jurist Dr Pervaiz Hassan, industrialists 
Razzaq Daud and Tariq Shafi, banker Shaukat Tareen and Nawab Ashique 
Husain Qureshi, son of former Punjab chief minister Nawab Sadiq Husain 
Qureshi.
    
Mr Khan said only five members of his family were among the governors 
of the hospital. He said it was not a family trust, as was being 
propagated by some quarters. It has been registered as a public trust 
with all the government organisations, he said.
    
During the year, an amount of Rs 76,989,446 was spent on 24,320 
patients while Rs 2,200,000 was collected from those patients who were 
able to pay for their treatment, he said.

<a name="lawe">Law enforcers harass passengers</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ghulam Hasnain

KARACHI, Jan 17: Air passengers arriving in the city at night are 
often exposed to hardships as some unscrupulous policemen on petrol 
who check their baggage have usually motives other than security.
    
Though harassment of air passengers, especially the overseas 
Pakistanis, is not a new phenomenon, the problem has magnified during 
recent months to such an extent that even the personnel of rangers and 
Frontier Constabulary, who are mainly deputised in the city to check 
terrorism, insist on carrying out a baggage search of the passengers.
    
A general monitoring of Quaid-i-Azam International Airport and the 
main Shahrea Faisal during nights and interviews with airport 
functionaries revealed that certain influential police officers, who 
allegedly enjoy political patronage, are running a major racket at the 
airport conning innocent overseas Pakistanis on one pretext or the 
other.  A passengers agony begins the moment he hires a yellow cab to 
go home.
    
Interviews with yellow cab drivers reveal that it is nearly impossible 
for any taxi driver to take passengers from the airport without the 
consent of airport police, because of which no taxi driver is ready to 
operate on the basis of fare meters.
    
As soon as a taxi leaves the parking lot, foot constables picketing a 
corner of the road will stop it and check the passengers baggage.
    
Once on Sharea Faisal, a passenger has to stop at several police 
pickets and on each occasion he has to explain his credentials and 
role out a few hundred rupees to save himself from the harassment.
    
The worst affected are those whose houses are located in the troubled 
localities of districts Central and East where even the personnel of 
Frontier Constabulary and rangers check their baggage, search their 
wallets and ask all sorts of questions.
    
They object even if a passenger is carrying only a single tape-
recorder and ask him to produce Customs receipts, although it is 
permitted under a passenger allowance.
    
An airport functionary told Dawn that recently the Airport police 
deployed some of its men right at the arrival and departure terminals 
on the pretext of keeping an eye on terrorists, but instead they 
indulge in all sorts of corrupt practices.
    
Another senior airport official told Dawn that in the last three 
months alone at least 12 overseas Pakistanis had reported that they 
were drugged and robbed of all their money at the airport, while an 
overseas Pakistani was kidnapped, looted and his body was thrown at 
the Clifton beach.
    
Though, policemen have been warned on several occasions by the high-
ups against harassing the passengers, the practice continues as the 
affected passengers are reluctant to lodge complaints.

<a name="sang">Sanghar by-election : PPP wins NA seat by massive margin</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter 

KARACHI, Jan 11: PPP candidate Senator Fida Hussain Dero won the 
Sanghar by-election, by securing 74,400 votes against his nearest 
rival PML candidate Islamuddin Qureshi who polled 17,112 votes, 
Shahdadpur Returning Officer Ghulam Mustafa Memon told Dawn by 
telephone.

Senator Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman, the PPP (SB) candidate, bagged 9,462 
votes.
    
Our Correspondents add: Polling in Tando Adam city was smooth and 
peaceful with turnout as low as 20 to 25 per cent. A large number of 
voters complained that their names had not been included in the 
additional list. There was complete chaos and confusion among voters 
and in most of the polling stations even party workers were not 
available to guide them.
    
Political workers admitted that there was a lack of public response.
    
In Shahdadpur and adjoining areas, Shaheed Bhutto group of the PPP 
complained of attacks, harassment and kidnapping of their polling 
agents.
    
However, when journalists visited various polling stations in the 
Shahdadpur town and polling stations in the interior, no complaints 
about harassment were made by any of the polling agents.
    
During visits to various polling stations of Shahdadpur, Sinjhoro and 
in the villages, it was observed that the polling was going on at a 
snails pace and the people did not seem interested in the process.

<a name="pmlb">PML boycotts poll, alleges rigging</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent  

HYDERABAD, Jan 11: The general secretary of Pakistan Muslim League, 
Sindh, Mr Zahid Rafiq Butt, PML candidate for (Sanghar-2) by-election, 
Haji Mohammad Islam Qureshi, and information secretary, Sindh, Mahfooz 
Yar Khan, while addressing a hurriedly called Press conference at the 
PML central election office at Shahdadpur at 3.50 pm on Thursday 
announced boycott of the by-election.
    
They accused the government and administration of worse type of 
rigging, harassment of voters and kidnapping of polling agents. They 
demanded of the chief election commissioner to order re-election under 
the direct supervision of Pakistan Army.
    
They said they also informed the PML chief, Mr Nawaz Sharif, and the 
election commissioner, Sindh, about the prevailing situation. They 
said finding no other via media, they had to announce the boycott of 
election with the consent of Mr Nawaz Sharif.
    
They said that at 80 polling stations, their polling agents were 
subjected to violence and were thrown out of the polling stations and 
added that thereafter it was only a one way traffic for the PPP 
candidate Senator Fida Hussain Dero.
    
They alleged that at 9.45 am when they visited the polling station of 
the village of Dida Hussain Dero, to their utter surprise, they saw 
that one ballot box had already been stuffed with votes.
    
They said that at polling station No. 141 at Soomar Faqir, the entire 
polling staff was thrown out at 2.25 pm and thereafter the ballot 
boxes were filled to capacity.
    
They claimed that they were in possession of a ballot book from serial 
number 19580 to 19720 which had already been stamped in favour of the 
PPP candidate.
    
The PML leaders complained that many election camps had been 
physically taken over by police and revenue department.
    
They alleged that at least 100 vehicles were snatched by the district 
administration and used for bringing the voters of Senator Dero.
    
They said Magsi force was also deployed along with police at various 
police stations while provincial minister Mohsin Shah Bukhari was 
giving directions to the polling staff.
    
They said at one ladies polling station, Pro-Zardari group resorted to 
firing and fractured the hand of a PML polling agent.

<a name="byel">Sanghar by-election : Low turn out of voters at polling stations</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aziz Malik and M.H. Khan  

SANGHAR, Jan 11: The much trumpeted by-election for Sanghar proved to 
be much ado about nothing. Confusion, extremely low turn-out of 
voters, complaints about massive rigging, show of force by police, 
alleged harassment of voters by the PPP candidate and, above all, an 
eleventh-hour boycott of election by the PML were the hallmarks of the 
day.
    
The Shaheed Bhutto group of the PPP also complained of attacks, 
harassment and kidnapping of their polling agents. However, when a 
group of journalists visited various polling stations in the 
Shahdadpur town and polling stations in the interior, no complaints 
about harassment were made by any of the polling agents.
    
They alleged that the state machinery was working as the agent of PPP 
candidate, Sen Fida Hussain Dero.
    
During visits to various polling stations of Shahdadpur, Sinjhoro and 
in the villages, it was observed that the polling was going on at a 
snails pace and the people did not seem interested in the process.
    
The presiding officers appeared confused about the polling timings as 
they had not been given any written orders in this respect. Some of 
them stated that the polling hours were between 8.30am and 4.30pm, 
while others maintained that it would continue from 8 to 4. And yet 
others said they had been given verbal instructions to conduct the 
polling from 9am to 4pm.
    
At the polling station 130 in the Maqsood Rind Government Primary 
School, only 175 votes had been cast out of 1,200 till 11.30am. No 
Muslim League agent was present at this polling station, and there 
were only 14 voters around. The situation at other polling stations 
was much the same.

A provincial PML leader, Shah Mohammad Shah, talking to these 
correspondents at the partys Sinjhoro office, alleged that women 
polling agents of his party had been picked up and the solid PML 
voters were being harassed. He said a magistrate had forcibly picked 
up PML polling agents from Dhani Bux Marh Deh 19, 26 and 27, and that 
bogus votes were cast at Chak 25.

He said the Turkish prime minister and former Indian premier the late

<a name="dero">Dero denies rigging charges</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KARACHI, Jan 14: Fida Hussain Dero, MNA-elect from NA-Sanghar-II, said 
that PPP was the symbol of federation and people proved this by voting 
for the PPP in the recent bye-election.
    
In a statement, he said those who voted for him included Sindhi, 
Punjabi and Urdu speaking people, as well as even the disciples of Pir 
Saheb Pagaro. He criticised the PML for not accepting the election 
results.
    
The constituency, he said, had all along been that of PPP, starting 
from 1988 elections, when PPPs Shahnawaaz Junejo received a landslide 
victory, in one-to-one fight. Except for 1990s rigged elections and 
winning by a few hundreds margin by Jam Mashooq in the 1993 
elections, the masses have solidly been behind the party, he said.
    
However, if the PML (N) had any concrete evidence of any 
irregularity, the legal course was to approach the Election 
Commission, Mr. Dero said. The MNA-elect said levelling of such an 
allegation was unfair and unfortunate.

<a name="thre">Three Killed and two MQM terrorists arrested</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KARACHI: Gulbahar Police have arrested two alleged terrorists of Altaf 
Group and recovered arms and ammunition from their possession after an 
encounter, while 10 other alleged terrorists fled. In another incident 
three people, including an MQM activist, were killed.
    
According to police sources, the SHO Gulbahar, along with a police 
mobile, was on patrol duty, when he received information that a gang 
of 12 armed terrorists had intentions of carrying out terrorist 
activities.
    
The police chased and arrested two accused, Iqbal Ghauri and 
Shujauddin while 10 others escaped. Accused Iqbal Ghauri was wanted in 
12 cases of murder and terrorism-related incidents, whereas accused 
Shujauddin was wanted in five cases of murder and dacoity.
    
Among those dead a young MQM worker was killed in an alleged gunbattle 
with the police in Sharifabad. The police initially identified him as 
Nisar, an associate of Naeem Sherri but later claimed that he was yet 
to be identified.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 12: MQM coordination committee rejected Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhuttos fresh offer of power-sharing as a move to deceive 
international public opinion.
    
The committee reiterated its charges against the ruling PPP and said: 
How can we trust when the PPP does not recognise the mandate of the 
Mohajirs and has kept most of our elected members under custody and is 
subjecting them to torture.
    
The committee castigated the government for allegedly arresting 
unspecified number of MQM activists in false cases and denying the 
party free and fair political activity.
    
It said that the government allegations that the MQM was allegedly 
recruiting terrorists from Bangladesh was aimed at preventing the 
repatriation of stranded Pakistanis in that country.
    
The coordination committee contended that the MQM had no interest in 
power-sharing, but it is determined to continue the struggle for the 
rights of 20 million Mohajirs.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 17: Dozens of unidentified armed men attacked the MQM 
Haqiqi headquarters in Landhi using rockets and automatic weapons.
    
The attackers who came in several vehicles carried out the attack from 
three sides. They are reported to have fired at least six rocket-
propelled grenades at the Haqiqi main office, but the rockets struck 
and damaged neighbouring houses instead.
    
Till the filing of this report, it was not clear how many people were 
wounded in the attack. Heavy shooting damaged KESCs pole-mounted 
transformers plunging the affected area into darkness.
   
Haqiqi chief Afaq Ahmed Khan accused the MQM-A and its militants of 
the attack and alleged that it was carried out on the orders of self-
exiled chief Altaf Hussain.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 15: One of the four MQM activists, who had allegedly 
gunned down the Sindh Chief Ministers younger brother, Syed Ihsan Ali 
Shah, on Nov. 23, was arrested, the police chief claimed.
    
The Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Mr Shoaib Suddle, told newsmen 
that his force had arrested an MQM activist who had admitted killing 
the Chief Ministers brother.
    
The suspect was identified as Syed Yureed Shah. Giving assassination 
details, the city police chief said There were no personal reasons 
behind the murder. The (CMs brother) was killed because he related to 
the Chief Minister.
    
During initial interrogation, the suspect told police that they were 
asked by the party (MQM) to carry out rocket attacks in the city and 
they were waiting for a date to launch the attack.

He told a questioner that all information was voluntarily provided by 
Yureed and at no stage he was tortured. He also went on to say that 
during initial interrogation Yureed had admitted killing at least half 
a dozen people, including a retired a police officer and policeman on 
Dec. 31 last.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Jan 11: The opposition staged a token walkout from the Punjab 
Assembly to protest against deputy speaker Manzoor Mohals refusal to 
admit a resolution denouncing the alleged attempt on the life of 
Nawaz Sharif in Hala.
    
Deputy opposition leader Parvez Elahi rose to read out the text of the 
resolution minutes before the house was to begin a debate on the state 
of jails in the province, claiming that the administration was 
involved in the attack.
    
Punjab law minister Afzal Hayat opposed the resolution, saying the 
treasury benches did not agree with the PMLs contention. He believed 
that only a unanimous resolution could be tabled in the house 
according to the rules of business, but did not quote any rule in 
support. The PMLs Tabish Alwari challenged him to quote the rules.
    
Mr Alwari asserted that the opposition wished to point out the 
lawlessness in the country through its resolution. The situation has 
reached a point where even an ex-prime minister is attacked.
    
The chair assigned ministers Rana Ikram Rabbani and Shahnawaz Cheema 
to convince the opposition to return to the house, but the session had 
to be adjourned for 15 minutes before the PML members came back to 
participate in the discussion on the state of jails.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Jan 12: Opposition leader in the National Assembly Mian Nawaz 
Sharif has said that recent agreement between his party, PML, and MQM 
will go a long way in bringing peace to Karachi.
    
He said Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos objections to the agreement 
were unfounded as her government was given about two years (by the 
opposition) to strike a deal with MQM leadership to settle the Karachi 
issue. It is only after the failure of the government to negotiate 
with MQM in two years that the PML has taken the initiative and 
attempted to understand MQM leaderships point of view on the long 
unresolved Karachi issue. Our efforts should be applauded instead of 
being criticised, he said.
    
Accusing the PPP government of hatching a conspiracy to divide Sindh 
and rule, Mr Sharif said that even Murtaza Bhutto, Ms Benazirs 
brother, had accused her of following such a policy to widen 
differences between Sindhis and Mohajirs.
    
My party wants to save the country from further division and is 
committed to find amicable solutions of deep rooted problems, 
specially in Sindh. The agreement with MQM will serve as a bridge to 
bring people of Sindh on one platform and think in unison to make 
Pakistan a prosperous nation, Mr Sharif said.
    
Reacting sharply on losing the Sanghar by-poll, Nawaz Sharif alleged 
mass scale rigging by the ruling party.

The mere issuance of a joint communiqui does not mean that some

added.
    
However, we were of considered opinion that as long as Benazir Bhutto 
remains in power, neither the Karachi issue will be resolved, nor the 
country can be taken out of the prevailing crisis, he said, adding

<a name="nisa">Nisar claims loot sale of energy reserves</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report   

ISLAMABAD, Jan 15: Former federal petroleum minister Chaudhry Nisar 
Ali Khan has appealed to the president to prevent the loot sale of 
over half of the countrys total energy reserves to the Hashoo Group, 
headed by Sadruddin Hashwani.
    
The PML leader released what he claimed were details of the almost 
finalised proposal which would enable the Hashoo Group to purchase 
63.9 per cent share holding of Burmah Oil Company (BOC) in Pakistan 
Petroleum Limited (PPL), which also owns Pakistans most important 
gasfield at Sui.
    
The BOC has been trying for the past three years to sell its shares 
because of diversification into other sectors but it requires a no-
objection certificate from the government before it sells its shares 
to a particular party.
    
But, as pointed out by Chaudhry Nisar, the transaction is not as 
straight forward as the government would like to portray. According to 
the proposal, he said, the BOC would sell off its entire share holding 
in the PPL to a giant Australian company, the BHP, which in turn would 
sell them to the Hashoo Group in lieu of the BOC selling BHP 8.5 per 
cent of its share holding in the Qadirpur gas field, while a 7 per 
cent share holding in the same field would be passed on by the PPL as 
well. The BHP would, therefore, have a 15.5 per cent share in the 
Qadirpur gas field and thus enjoy a pre-emptive right to acquire 
Qadirpur, when the government privatises its 70 per cent shares. In 
other words, he said, BHP is literally taking an openly official 
commission of a 15.5 per cent stake in the countrys energy reserves 
for playing a front-man for the Hashoo Group. Could there be a bigger 
blatant example of corruption.
    
Nisar charged that the planned privatisation of Qadirpur gas field too 
was a violation of an earlier cabinet decision wherein it had been 
decided that no discovered gas field, owned by the government, would 
be privatised. He said that the Qadirpur field had not even been 
evaluated while even by the most conservative estimates its 
recoverable reserves stood at about four trillion cubic feet with an 
estimated value of about US$5 billion while the field had contributed 
Rs400 million to the national exchequer in 1994 alone. Opposing the 
privatisation of any of the gas fields he pointed out that put 
together, the fields of Qadirpur, Sui and Kandkot had given a revenue 
of Rs7 billion in 1994-5 alone. Quoting from what he said were the 
minutes of the last meeting of the Economic Committee of the Cabinet, 
Chaudhry Nisar claimed that the proposal was approved at that meeting. 
He said: The item was not even on the days agenda but was hushed in 
at the last minute and gotten passed despite the on-record objections 
of various other ministries whereas the ministry of finance was not 
even represented in that meeting.

The shear manner of the passage of this proposal too, in his opinion, 
betrayed the presence of naked corruption. He maintained that it was 
highly risky to hand over 50 per cent of the countrys natural gas to 
a single company which has only been in the business for a little 
over a year and has no real standing or experience. The former 
minister alleged that instead of adopting the standard method of 
inviting open offers for such a deal the government had silently 
negotiated with only one party on totally unacceptable terms, for 
obvious reasons.
    
He called upon President Leghari to prevent the bartering away of 
Pakistans economic and Strategic interests. Acknowledging, that 
earlier also a presidential intervention had blocked the sale of OGDC 
for a song, he added that this is an even more serious issue which 
demanded the presidents personal intervention.

<a name="wbpr">WB proposal rejected : Govt not to privatise canal system</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, Jan 13: The federal government is said to have turned down a 
World Bank proposal for privatising of the countrys irrigation 
system. But at the same time it has approved the concept of 
decentralisation of the system and participatory irrigation management 
under the National Drainage Project (NDP) which will be undertaken in 
a few canal command areas on an experimental basis.
    
The six-year project will involve a cost of about $785 million, out of 
which the World Bank and other donor agencies have promised to invest 
$525 million. Work on the project is due to commence in July this year 
and is expected to be completed by June 30, 2001. Of this fund, the 
Asian Development Bank has earmarked $140 million and the Overseas 
Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan will contribute $100 million. The 
remaining cost will be shared by the federal government, which is to 
provide an amount of $162 million, and provincial governments, $66 
million.
    
As has been agreed between the federal and provincial governments and 
the World Bank, the provincial irrigation departments will transfer 
management of water to provincial irrigation and drainage authorities 
(PIDAs) which will come into effect from July 1.
    
Under the authorities, area water boards (AWBs), on the pattern of 
area electricity boards in WAPDA, will be set up for the management of 
irrigation water.
    
Water rates, according to the World Bank proposal, should not be 
uniform. They should be settled on negotiations between AWBs and 
water-user groups.
    
Consensus on decentralisation of the irrigation system was reached.    
While there is general agreement on most of the details of the revised 
scheme, the federal and provincial governments have opposed the World 
Bank suggestion that PIDAs, AWBs and water-user formations be 
registered as limited companies under the Companies Ordinance, 1984. 
The government is of the view that this would amount to privatisation 
of the system which is not on the agenda. The government may, however, 
agree to these bodies being regulated under the Corporate Law 
Authority as autonomous enterprises having the power to negotiate 
water rates with users.
    
According to official sources, the World Bank was of the view that 
two-thirds of the existing staff was in excess or did not qualify to 
be associated with PIDAs and AWBs. It has set a three- year deadline 
for absorption of the employees in other departments.
    
As for PIDAs and AWBs, the World Bank has recommended that they should 
engage consultants, to be selected in cooperation with the Bank, to 
prepare detailed staffing and business plans so that the two bodies 
achieve financial self-sufficiency in three years.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

THE State Bank of Pakistan through the sale of government treasury 
bills at its open market operation mopped up Rs 1.95 billion. 
Reportedly the Central Bank sold Rs 850 million worth of TBs in the 
outright sale of TBs and an additional Rs 1.1 billion worth of TBs 
were sold in repos. Call rates ranged between 13-17 per cent.
    
Liquidity in the market will get tighter as non-bank financial 
institutions deposit one percent of their deposits as cash margin on 
zero rate of return with the State Bank of Pakistan.
    
As a direct consequence, banks normally doing REPO transactions with 
non-banks to square off their daily position, will be faced with 
higher rates on borrowing from NBFIs.
    
According to the weekly State Bank statement of affairs for the week 
ended January 4, 1996, notes in circulation continued the downward 
trend and fell by a further Rs 3168.07 million. Notes declined to Rs 
243,404.706 million during the week from Rs 246,572.775 million a week 
earlier. In the corresponding week last year notes in circulation 
amounted to Rs 215,766.240 million. Thus the current weeks figure was 
higher by Rs 27,638.47 million over the last years.

In the corresponding week a year earlier, notes issued amounted to Rs 
216,038.568 million. So the figure of the current week was higher by 
Rs 27,778.49 million over last years figure.
    
Approved foreign exchange nearly doubled, as it rose to Rs 50,530.862 
million over previous weeks Rs 25,949.056 million, a rise of Rs 
24,581.80 million. When compared to last years figure of Rs 
78,087.217 million the foreign exchange position was however, lowered 
by Rs 27,556.36 million.
    
Balances held outside Pakistan including cash and short-term 
securities which had fallen in the last week of December, showed a 
further substantial fall.
    
Advances to the industrial sector amounted to Rs 8,660.422 million 
showing a fall of Rs 94.11 million over preceding weeks Rs 8,754.527 
million. In the corresponding period last year, advances to the sector 
amounted to Rs 9,325.717 million.
    
The week also saw a rise in the credit flow to the export sector. 
Advances to the sector increased by Rs 209.24 million at Rs 32,536.931 
million over Rs 32.327.689 million a week earlier. In the 
corresponding period a year ago, the advances to the sector amounted 
to Rs 28,059.975 million.
    
The scheduled banks statement of position for the week ended December 
28, 1995 shows that total liabilities continued to grow. Total 
deposits rose by Rs 9588 million at Rs 726,126 million over Rs 716,538 
million in the preceding week. When compared with the corresponding 
period of last year when total liabilities amounted to Rs 651,312 
million, the current weeks figure was higher by Rs 74,814 million.
    
Both type of deposits, namely demand and time deposits rose during the 
week under review. Time liabilities also increased in the week as 
compared with the previous weeks level. These rose by Rs 6137 million 
at Rs 387,406 million over preceding weeks Rs 381,269 million. They 
were higher by Rs 47,026 million over the deposits of Rs 340,380 
million in the same period a year earlier.
    
The need to borrow from banks abroad which had declined a week 
earlier, showed a rise during the week under review. These rose by Rs 
867 million at Rs 15,272 million over Rs 14,405 million a week 
earlier. In the corresponding period a year ago, borrowings from banks 
abroad totalled Rs 13,533 million.
    
Total assets of scheduled banks amounted to Rs 1,692,933 million over 
preceding weeks Rs 1,737,814 million showing a fall of Rs 44,881 
million. In the corresponding week last year, assets amounted to Rs 
1,562,311 million.

Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 16: The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100-share 
attained the coveted mark of 1,500 points but some analysts doubted 
its ability to sustain it at least for the near-term.

The KSE 100-share price index was last quoted at 1,500.94 as compared 
to 1,491.02 a day earlier, reflecting the strength of base shares.

The market was largely shared by blue chips on all the counters under 
the lead of pivotals such as Siemens, Shell Pakistan, Crescent 
Textiles, Fauji Fertiliser, and BOC Pakistan, which posted gains 
ranging from one rupee to Rs 12.67. The biggest rise was noted in BOC, 
which was quoted ex-dividend and ex-bonus.

The notable feature was that some of the low-priced textile shares 
came in for active short-covering and ended sharply higher under the 
lead of Taha Spinning and Lafayette Textiles, which rose by Rs 5 and 
4.50.

Insurance shares were also traded sharply higher on renewed support 
aided by news of higher interim earnings. Century Insurance, EFU 
General, Habib and Metro Life Insurance were leading gainers amid 
active trading.

Other gainers were led by ICP Mutual funds followed by Century Paper. 
UDL Industries, Soneri and Metropolitan Banks, rising by one rupee to 
Rs 10.

Selling was largely confined to Asset Bank, which has risen sharply 
overnight, Shafiq Textiles, Dewan Salman, National Fibre, PEL, 
Pakistan Refinery. KASB & Co, Pakistan Gum and Lever Brothers, which 
suffered decline ranging from Rs 2 to 7.

Hub-Power topped the list of most actives, up 65 paisa on 8.212 
million shares followed by PTC vouchers, easy five paisa on 3.716 
million shares, Sitara Energy, steady 10 paisa on 550,000 shares, 
Faysal Bank, lower five paisa on 391,700 shares, Metro Life Insurance, 
higher Rs 1.70 on 336,000 shares.

Other actives were led by Lucky cement, easy 50 paisa on 306,600 
shares, ICI Pakistan, lower 20 paisa on 250,600 shares, Ibarhim Fibre, 
off 35 paisa on 235,000 shares and Fauji Fertiliser, higher Rs 2.85 on 
579,500 shares.

Trading volume was maintained at the overnight level of well over 21 
million shares thanks to active dealings in pivotals. There were 346 
actives, out of which 131 shares rose, while 130 fell with 85 
remaining pegged at the last close.

higher interim earnings and were quoted sharply higher under the lead 
of Century, EFU and Union Insurance, which posted gains ranging from

support and were marked up by Rs 2 to 5 for Exide Pakistan, BOC 
Pakistan, Engro Chemicals, Nestle Milkpak, Reckitt and Colman and 
Lever Brothers.
    
Among the local blue chips, which rose appreciably most of the ICP 
Mutual funds, notably the second and the 5th. KASB & Co, Prime Bank,

Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE judiciary shall (repeat shall) be separated progressively from 
the Executive within three years from the commencing day..., loudly 
and proudly proclaimed the 1973 Constitution promulgated by our first 
civilian martial law administrator, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, during whose 
reign dissent could at best be voiced by silence or recorded by 
abstention.
    
The promulgator deluded the people. He had no intention of abiding by 
his promulgation, for within four hours of the birth of our 
Constitution, under cover of the State of Emergency which ruled 
supreme (until overtaken by Zias martial law in July 1977), the 
people were denied the fundamental rights and freedoms that had been 
guaranteed to them.
    
Thereafter, the promulgator, suspending the rules of procedure, saw to 
it that seven constitutional amendment bills, affecting mainly the 
liberties of the people and injuring the judiciary, were rushed 
through the National Assembly without any meaningful deliberation or 
discussion.
    
Let us look at the Third Amendment, passed on February 18, 1975. Inter 
alia, it empowered the government to detain a man without trial for a 
period of three months instead of one month as originally provided. 
The grounds on which he could be held were enlarged to include 
anything that in the opinion of the government was tantamount to anti-
national activities or was prejudicial to the integrity, security or 
defence of Pakistan  activities ranging from the alleged theft of a 
buffalo to the voicing of dissent.
    
The Fourth Amendment (November 25, 1975), inter alia, enlarged the 
scope of preventive laws and further restricted what little freedom of 
association we then had. It deprived the High Courts of their power to 
grant bail to any person detained under any preventive detention law 
and to prohibit the making of executive orders for detention.
    
The Fifth Amendment (September 15, 1976), inter alia, extended the 
period of the separation of the judiciary from the executive from 
three to five years, thus bringing the deadline to August 1978. It 
also fixed a tenure of five and four years respectively for the Chief 
Justices of the Supreme Court and the High Courts (favouring those in 
favour). It prohibited the High Courts, in the case of preventive 
detentions, from restraining the detention of a person, from granting 
bail before arrest, or from ordering the release of a person on bail.
    
The Sixth Amendment (January 4, 1977) allowed the Chief Justices of 
the Supreme and High Courts to hold office for tenures of five and 
four years respectively, even though they may have attained the 
retirement ages of 65 and 62.
    
This was tailor-made to suit Justice Yaqub Ali so as to allow him to 
continue in office beyond retirement age. The good judge had publicly 
paid glowing tributes to Bhutto on December 8, 1976: I can say from 
personal knowledge, he observed in his address to the Third Pakistan 
Jurists Conference, that the Prime Minister by conviction has great 
respect for the judiciary from the lowest to the highest rung. (Dawn 
December 9, 1976) Within three weeks, Bhuttos respect, at least at 
the highest rung, found expression in the Sixth Amendment Act amending 
the Fifth.
    
All this happened when Yahya Bakhtiar was Attorney-General, the first 
law officer of the land. (Reportedly daughter Benazirs government 
will be represented by the same Yahya when the hearing of the present 
Judges Case resumes in the Supreme Court on January 21).
    
Then in rode Zia, mounted on martial law (Martial law is no law at 
all. Martial law is brute force. Of course, all martial law is 
illegal, and an attempt to introduce illegalities into martial law, 
which is not military law, is like attempting to add salt water to the 
sea. Churchill, 1906). Zia introduced the PCO in March 1981 and 
finished off whatever independence the judiciary had been left with. 
Two judges of the Supreme Court refused to take the oath  Chief 
Justice Anwarul Haq and Justice Dorab Patel. Their example was 
followed by Ad Hoc Judge Fakhruddin Ebrahim.
    
Had all the judges of the superior courts stood firm and refused to 
take the oath, Zia would have backed down. As a sop, by his 
Presidential Order No. 14 of 1985, he extended the period for the 
separation of the judiciary to 14 years, to August 1987. Zias 
principal legal adviser was my friend Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada. My 
efforts to make him write the truth as he knows it (naturally for 
posthumous publication) have so far been unsuccessful.
    
On February 1, 1988, Federal Minister for Law and Parliamentary 
Affairs Waseem Sajjad made a passing reference to the separation of 
the judiciary from the administration, by his own admission 
obligatory under the Constitution. We are at it, said he, sorting 
out prerequisites.
    
Our assorted governments have now been at it for 22 years. Is the 
present government still sorting out prerequisites? We have never 
been informed what these time-consuming prerequisites may be, but it 
would seem that in the case of the separation of the judiciary from 
the executive (and in many other cases) all our governments have found 
themselves in the same predicament as Alices Queen: it took her all 
the running she could do to keep herself in the same place. The only 
advice we can give to this government is that it should try to run 
twice as fast in order to advance by one step, in spite of the fact 
that by now, the people are convinced that no government of ours can 
afford to have an independent judiciary.
    
Now, 22 years down the road, with Benazir as prime minister for the 
second time, crime and lawlessness is on the rise, especially in 
Karachi where many police stations (as admitted by none other than the 
President) are sold to the highest bidder or the prime favourite.
    
Our government was recently diplomatically chastised by the US State 
Department: We are deeply concerned by the escalating cycle of 
violence in Karachi and particularly by the sharp increase in reported 
extra-judicial killings, extortion and custodial deaths by security 
forces. (Dawn December 13, 1995). Our governments sole reaction was 
to term this as interference in our internal affairs, and in a 
strongly worded statement admitting that action has been taken where 
there have been police excesses. The strong statement may have made 
the US shiver and shake with fright but it did not make it retract 
what had been said, and it has certainly made no difference to what is 
on the ground. The suffering and anxiety of the people have not 
lessened.
    
Does this government not realise that extra-judicial killings and 
police excesses only tend to further increase the lawlessness and 
terrorism, the unruly claiming the right to act as does the 
government?
    
Worse still, the judiciary has been politicised and weakened as never 
before. Three of our four High Courts are presided over by Acting 
Chief Justices, who sit at the governments whim and fancy. Most 
disturbing is the manner in which Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah of 
Pakistan (along with his family) is being intimidated and pressured to 
appoint judges of the governments choice and to act against his 
better judgment and will. The people and the Press have voiced their 
resentment and the executive has been editorially condemned.
    
The Law Reforms Committee of the Pakistan Bar Council has passed a 
resolution and has ...strongly condemned all acts of harassment and 
views these as brazen attacks on the independence of the judiciary.
    
Salahuddins Takbeer (4-11 January) under the heading Chief Justice 
victim of PPP vengeance reports that the CJs nephew and son-in-law 
Pervaiz Ali Shah, a Sindh provincial service engineer who has been 
arbitrarily suspended from service, was officially sent for by Chief 
Minister Abdullah Shah and it was conveyed to him that it would be in 
the interest of the family if his father-in-law were to toe the line. 
A cattle rustlers move, if one may say so. Abdullah Shah also called 
on the CJ in Rawalpindi, as did many times Defence Minister Aftab 
Shahban Mirani. Benazirs discussion with the CJ, with her spouse 
interposing, as reported by Takbeer makes sad reading. Can our young 
Prime Minister not be persuaded to avail herself of wise counsel? She 
would do well to read what that angry Chief Justice of Sindh, Tufail 
Ali Abdul Rehman, wrote to her father in 1973 when his government 
arrested Judge Owais of Sanghar and handcuffed and maltreated him:
    
I have so far refrained from such action as lay within my authority 
but would now venture to suggest that two steps are immediately 
necessary: (1) that an inquiry under the Public Inquiries Act be held 
by a judge of the High Court, who should be appointed in consultation 
with me, to determine the circumstances which led to this arrest, and 
(2) that the Government of Sindh should give me a satisfactory 
assurance that anybody who I post as District Judge in Sanghar or 
elsewhere will not be harassed or victimised. If, however, you are not 
persuaded that these courses are necessary I shall have to take such 
steps as may be proper and lie within my power.

<a name="indi">India's nuclear obsession</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

This is no coincidence that first Canada and now the United States 
have voiced concern over the threat posed by India's bloated nuclear 
ambitions to South Asia's security situation and political stability. 
Indeed, there are clear indications that major Western nations are 
genuinely alarmed by reports that India, which conducted its first 
nuclear explosion in 1974, may be about to carry out another test. New 
Delhi's denial notwithstanding, the reports can no longer be regarded 
as merely speculative. Washington has even warned New Delhi of 
possible economic and other sanctions in the event of a new test 
explosion. This it did shortly after satellite monitoring indicated 
preparations for a new nuclear test.

Mr Jean Chretien, urged his Indian counterpart not to delay the 
signing of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT). Earlier, 
reports from Ottowa had indicated that Mr Chretien had sought - and 
possibly secured- assurances from New Delhi that it was not on the 
verge of a new nuclear test explosion, and threatened to call off his 
visit in case India went ahead with its plans. Mr Chretien did not 
mince his words when, talking to Indian newsmen at the President's 
House in New Delhi, he said that India had no option but to sign the 
NPT and that it was no longer a question of New Delhi accepting or not 
accepting the treaty. A day after the Canadian prime minister's 
statement, the US ambassador in India, while addressing businessmen in 
Bombay, expressed the view that India's planned nuclear arsenal would 
in no sense add to its own security and would, on the contrary, 
heighten tensions in the region. The ambassador even disclosed  that 
the US was maintaining a "candid and regular dialogue" with New Delhi 
- which seemed to suggest that Washington was actively pursuing a 
policy to dissuade New Delhi from its perilous path of building a 
nuclear arsenal.

Without doubt, once New Delhi went full steam ahead with its nuclear 
weapons programme, it would mark the beginning of a nuclear arms race 
in the region. India's real or rationally perceived security needs do 
not justify such an arsenal. Indeed, the real reason for its nuclear 
ambition could be seen in the context of its potential as an 
instrument of blackmail to be used against India's neighbours, 
especially Pakistan. To add to the tensions generated by the spy 
satellites having detected preparations for a nuclear explosion in 
Pokhran, there have also been reports that India has threatened to 
renege on its commitment to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
(CTBT), due later this year, hoping to drive a bargain for extracting 
certain concessions, notably a permanent seat in the Security Council 
and the recognition of its status as a nuclear power. One hopes that 
major powers, such as the US, would not hesitate to use all political, 
diplomatic and economic means to leave India in no doubt that they 
would not yield to such blackmail.

There are strong indications that India's prime minister P.V. 
Narasimha Rao may have decided to raise the threshold of his country's 
nuclear capability with an eye on the forthcoming general elections, 
when the Congress would be pitted against the Hindu fundamentalist 
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) whose manifesto calls for a full-fledged 
nuclear weapons; programme. Since September last, several Indian-
leaders and officials have made statements stressing the need for 
India to link the CTBT to the larger question of global nuclear 
disarmament and not to accept it in the limited context of a non-
proliferation regime. In view of the American warning of sanctions in 
the event of a second test explosion in Pokhran, the BJP has been 
demanding that India deliver a "fitting reply" to Washington by going 
ahead with the planned test.

Hawks in India present the issue as a test of India's sovereignty and 
ability to stand up to external pressure. New Delhi must realise that 
such brinkmanship would not only escalate the nuclear competition in 
South Asia but would also turn into an international pariah divested 
of the position of respect and influence it covets to occupy in the 
council of nations.

<a name="trad">Trade with India: addressing the fears</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Ali Syed

THE issue of granting the MFN status to India has prompted an intense 
dialogue. Perhaps, we have woken at last up to the changing realities 
of the world and we are ready to make a firm decision about the future 
of our nation based on enlightened self-interest. Are Pakistan and 
India doomed by history to be perpetually locked in self-destructive 
hostility (like two scorpions in a bottle), or is there hope that one 
day we can work together in close cooperation to solve the multi-
dimensional problems of our two great peoples (like USA and former 
USSR)?

The current "MFN status" discussions are coloured by an incorrect 
perception of international trade and its effects on the economy. 
There is a desire to have an even balance of trade with India. In 
simple terms, those who oppose trade with India are scared that we 
will be importing more from India than we will be exporting to it; and 
thus be dreadfully dependent on it. Although the specifics of 
determining accurately the economic consequences of trade with India 
are better left (not surprisingly) to the economists, a little 
clarification about the basic nature of international trade would help 
clear thinking about the issue. What people seem to forget is that 
India is not the only other country in the world. Pakistan trades with 
many countries, having diverse import and export relations with them. 
Though it is desirable that we maintain a roughly even aggregate trade 
balance (determined after adding total exports and total imports to 
and from all trading partners), it is not even worth considering 
equalling exports with imports to an individual country.

If we, as a result of granting MFN status to India, end up importing 
more from India than we export to it, there is nothing stopping us 
from exporting more to other countries and thus making up for any 
imbalance that may occur. Also, increasing imports from India means 
that our imports from some of our other trading partners will fal1, as 
we find cheaper substitutes coming in from India. So, if we have a 
higher ratio of imports (to exports) from India, we will have a lower 
ratio of imports (to exports) with other countries. The overall 
picture will not be adversely affected.

In fact, if we find cheaper goods coming in from India, we gain by 
consuming at a lower price (or consuming more) and also, by moving 
resources away from sectors in which we are relatively inefficient to 
sectors where we possess comparative advantage in production. If we 
are inefficient at producing a certain commodity, it would only be 
wiser for us to import it if it is available cheaply from India, and 
concentrate in producing those commodities which we are good at 
producing. By specialising in production of commodities which we excel 
at producing, we can drive down their prices and thereby increase our 
exports of those products, as more countries will find them 
affordable.

The fears of our "dependency" (on India), arising out of a negative 
trade balance, are the result of a very naive and simplistic view of 
the world. If there is any dependency in Pakistan on Indian imports, 
then there is an equal dependency in India for the revenues that their 
exports to us contribute to their economy. The close proximity of our 
two nations make trade very convenient and once a stable pattern has 
been established, both trading partners would be averse to drastic 
changes.

This was the economic side. There is a political aspect too. Our 
governments have been in the constant search for ways and means to 
expand and perpetuate their dominance, mostly at the expense of 
national well being. I contend that our governments have never 
sincerely tried to mend our relations with India because it has been 
very convenient for them to keep India alive as a scapegoat, to put 
the blame on whenever their pathetic domestic policies are questioned. 
The same has been the record for Indian governments. When it has been 
proven beyond doubt that trade among nations is beneficial to the 
welfare of the people, and that petty politics must not be allowed to 
interfere with free-trade patterns, our politicians still continue to 
be wary of allowing trade relations between India and Pakistan to 
flourish.

I do not say that we must not help Kashmiri Muslims in their fight 
against oppression, but that we must explore new and realistic 
solutions. If we give up hostilities now and take effective measures 
to strengthen our economy and build our prestige in the world, we can 
then more effectively help the Kashmiris. Persisting in militaristic 
endeavours will not help the nation in any respect.

The basis of our support for Kashmir is the affinity we feel for our 
Muslim brothers there. After all our creation was based on the two 
nation theory and it is our duty to help Muslims. But may I ask what 
happened to the two-nation theory in 1971? What were we thinking when 
we treated our East Pakistani brothers the way we did? What is 
happening to the two-nation theory now, when we are denying the 
stranded Biharis - who incidentally were the only collaborators our 
army had in their occupation of East Pakistan (remember Al-Badar and 
Al-Shams?) their right to enter Pakistan and be treated as Pakistani 
citizens? It is clear that a lot has changed since the patriotic days 
of Partition. Our leaders' support for the Kashmiri people may not be 
motivated completely by an altruistic desire to alleviate their 
suffering. Yet, our current stand on Kashmir causes enmity with India, 
and necessitates excessive military spending.

The only thing that excessive military spending will help in doing, is 
in securing the generals of the army an undeservedly large role in 
national politics and a free hand in obstructing democracy at their 
whim. Maybe their aversion to allow democracy flourish in urban Sindh 
and disruption of liberties of Karachiites flow from this expanded 
role they have acquired. What business do the armed forces have in 
dominating politics? The army will never want Pakistan to be friendly 
with India, because its reason for existence will be questioned, and 
it will not be able to take the huge chunk that it does from our hard 
earned national revenues. And reliance on military solutions to our 
security problems in the absence of genuine political and economic 
endeavours will only help us to the extent that it has helped us in 
the past (to be precise, not help us at all). In any case, to feel 
safe we need strong friends not strong enemies.

There have been no Hiroshimas since Hiroshima. Yes, not a single 
nuclear weapon has been used offensively since the US lobbed one at 
the Japanese city at the peak of World War II. It is quite likely that 
India won't use one on us and face reprisals, from the international 
community, which it is so trying to woo. Let India spend senselessly 
on building nukes, let them tie up resources in unproductive 
enterprises. It will only hamper their progress, as military 
competition is out of vogue. None of the military aggressors of this 
age have gained from their actions (remember Saddam?) and war is 
increasingly becoming outdated, as slavery and duelling have become.

In any case, if we howl about India's military programme, it will only 
strengthen their resolve to pursue their programmes with greater 
vigour. The message that the Indians get when we scream about their 
military programme is: "if it's bad for them, then it's good for us". 
In this way Indian politicians can easily get their public to tally 
behind them, using anti-Pakistan rhetoric. The same goes for our own 
politicians who find India-bashing most convenient when they need a 
few cheap political points. Its about time that we focus instead on 
building up our economy, which is the only credible investment in 
ensuring a bright future and the only real protection we can have from 
our enemies. Why is Japan so safe and cosy? Definitely, not because it 
has one of the most formidable military establishments in the world.

Another source of hostile behaviour towards India are the 
fundamentalists, etc, who never cease in their senseless rhetoric. In 
another one of their classic theatrical outbursts, they have said that 
the "imported Hindustani potatoes wounded our national pride", in a 
recent column. One is only amused at the logic employed by such 
propagandists, and saddened by the fact that our poor, ignorant people 
might actually fall for such beguiling syllogisms. What does a 
superarmed country have to feel proud about when it cannot feed its 
hungry? When it cannot house the homeless? When most of its population 
is illiterate?

Once India and Pakistan are locked into a stable pattern of trade, 
peace is inevitable and mutual security will be ensured. Both 
countries will have too much to lose from armed confrontation and will 
prefer peace vastly to any hostility something like the US and Canada.

<a name="zard">Zardari: The all-profit, no-loss man in Islamabad</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Anjum Niaz

HES THE most controversial figure east of Suez. Stories of mega- 
bucks stashed away in Swiss banks accrued through huge defence 
kickbacks, an exotic French villa, polo ponies worth 300 million, 
money made in just about any government deal, and meddling in 
appointments of all grade 18 to 22 officers are stories gaining 
currency in the Capital nowadays.
    
Mr Asif Ali Zardari gives directions to all the heads of the DFIs 
(Development Financial Institutions) hand-picked by him, every night 
on his secrophone, an ex opposition MNA tells me with a deadpan 
expression. You cant catch him, because he covers his tracks 
beautifully, says the man with a long face. With ruination writ large 
all over him, he tells me his pre-partition business and the future of 
his generations is bleak because the husband of the Prime Minister is 
backing his business rival!
    
Then, I meet some others who swear that the First Gentleman is 
controlling the presidents of the nationalised banks  appointed by 
him  who dare not squeak without his approval. You should talk to 
some of them and find out whats going on, I am duly advised.
    
Some call Asif Zardari Godfather one and two and say he was 
corrupt during Ms Bhuttos first term, but is much worse in the 
second!
    
The First Gentleman calmly pleads not guilty to all the above 
charges, which I blurt out during a two-hour interview with him at the 
Prime Ministers House. Cool, composed and in good humour, he allows 
me all the time in the world to question him on anything under the 
sun. He lets me use my tape recorder: good, you wont misquote me, 
he flashes his characteristic smile. No one disturbs the sahib 
during our talk, only once his three children storm in with filial 
horseplay to say goodnight to their father. Their mother that evening 
is in Larkana in connection with their grandfathers birthday 
celebrations.

Knowing full well that the reason for my being accorded an exclusive 
is to portray the environment-business-friendly First Gentleman, I 
naturally open my interview with his favourite topic. He is eloquent, 
well clued and sincere about his work. We then move on to politics and 
finally end up with his personal life. But the bottom line running 
through our conversation is: why is the presumption of his being de 
facto prime minister beginning to stick now?
    
You have to realise that Benazir Bhutto is the Prime Minister of 
Pakistan, she is not a puppet created by anybody  that much you have 
got to grant her  no matter what the opposition says. The country 
cant be driven by dual drivers. Theres one leader and its her 
decisions which are carried out.
    
Besides, what experience do I have that I can give her advice on 
matters of the state, he says.
    
But, you are accused of running the government? even to naming the 
federal secretaries, who have been appointed to key positions because 
of their reputation to deliver? I again remind him.
    
Why should I do that? How much do I gain by it. I am 41 years, all 
these gentlemen you are referring to are old enough to be my father. 
Besides, I dont belong to Islamabad, I am a Karachiite and if I had 
my way, I would be living in Karachi  thats where my eyes sparkle  
how would you expect me to know the bureaucracy here. I dont even 
know most of their names!
    
What about cronyism? Your detractors say you mastermind all 
appointments, transfers and sackings on that basis? I persist.
    
I dont even think the deputy commissioner, Nawabshah, has been 
appointed by me (gives a loud laugh). I cant even tell Minister Yusuf 
Talpur to appoint his secretary (Agriculture) according to my wishes. 
All these things are done by the PM and her cabinet. People can say 
whatever they like. Its their prerogative. This is the beauty of 
democracy and you (Press) can write whatever you feel like, he 
replies. He defends his friends like a hawk, saying they would never 
exploit his name: Birds of a feather flock together, says he.
    
However, your public image today is not good? I again ask.

I dont agree with you. Its much better this time. People know me 
now and thats why I won both the seats from Lyari and Nawabshah 
despite my being in prison.
    
And what about the massive corruption you are accused of by your 
detractors?
    
I dont have such a reputation. People who can come up with concrete 
proof against me should do so. Nawaz Sharif says I have 80 stables and 
my polo ponies are worth 30 crores (300 millions). The truth is I have 
50 stables, out of which 12 horses belong to me and the rest to the 
seven other polo players. Nawaz Sharif has made a laughing stock of 
himself  where in the world does a polo pony cost 30 crores (300 
millions)?
    
Besides I pay for the food of my cats, chickens, dogs and horses from 
my own pocket. BB closes all the lights at night, do you think she 
will let me spend government money on the upkeep of my horses?
    
What about your French villa?
    
I have rebutted this story 10 times over. I cant even look after my 
Nawabshah and Karachi houses  we have, husband and wife, contemplated 
buying a house in Islamabad, but it hasnt materialised. How many 
times have I gone to Paris that I need a villa there, why should I get 
a villa when I cant even speak French? What will I do there? If you 
dont know French, what do you do? Talk to the dog?
    
The Prime Minister says her husband is a businessman, a property 
developer. Dont you think, theres a conflict of interest here and 
you can be accused of misusing your VVIP status? I ask.
    
No, my property development work is only Karachi-based and its only 
in the private sector, its nothing to do with the government, he 
says.
    
But dont you think you should not be doing it, knowing full well it 
will earn you a bad name?
    
If I take a government contract, then I can be blamed, but if I got 
plots which I owned before I met Benazir Bhutto and am now in the 
process of developing, I dont think anybody can raise any fingers at 
me. Its my personal property bought from the market and listed with 
the income-tax people, he defends himself.
    
As a spouse of the PM should you not practise more transparency in 
your business deals? You are said to have amassed billions? Why not be 
someone like Dennis Thatcher or the husband of Turkish PM Tansu 
Ciller? I ask.
    
Why should I do that, particularly when my business has nothing to do 
with the government? Come to Karachi and see all my properties for 
yourself. Ill take you to my office and show you all the 
documentation. All my plots are 15 years old. The only new plot I have 
purchased in government is the plot in front of Bilawal House because 
Jam Sadiq wanted a high rise constructed there.
    
In BBs first term, I didnt even live in Islamabad, but the more one 
is in the background, the more people talk about. So I decided to 
enter politics and step forward in order to defend myself properly.
    
First of all, when I married Benazir Bhutto, Zia was alive, Mohammad 
Khan Junejo was his PM  no matter how good a fortune teller I am, how 
the hell would I have known that Zia would dismiss Junejo and then die 
with all his generals? If people think I married BB because she was 
going to be the PM, then at that time I should have married Pir 
Pagaras daughter or Junejos! Why should I marry a lady who had the 
police attack her daily?
    
It is said, when the time comes, you will take your money and run? I 
tell him.
    
God is Great, whatever may be or will be is in Gods hands. Why 
should I run now when I didnt in the past? One wasnt scared of Zia, 
Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Aslam Beg, Nawaz Sharif, nor is one scared of these 
pygmies even today.
    
The sky is the limit, whats your limit? Do you wish to hold your 
wifes office some day? I ask.

No way! I couldnt even read the files she reads every night! 
(laughs) I am not trained that way, besides no one will vote for me. I 
am a political identity of a very small stature. But as a male, I will 
always stand vigil outside my home. Even the smallest male sparrow 
fights with his life to safeguard its nest from the predator, the 
kite. Whenever my house is threatened one will resist  no matter how 
small or weak a man one may be.

Whats life like with a woman who has brought you to the PM House 
twice? I venture to ask.
    
(Long pause): Very difficult... to say the least, he replies. After 
another pause, he continues, Its not easy to be a male spouse in 
such a position in this part of the world...its not easy...
    
What kind of a relationship do you have with your in-laws? I ask.
    
I have only one in-law, my mother-in-law. We have never traded any 
harsh words. I would never imagine raising my voice in front of her, 
she is my elder.
    
What about your brother-in-law, Mir Murtaza Bhutto?
    
Hes aspiring to be a politician, hes trying very hard... we have 
nothing in common, nor have I met him.
    
Mir says you have usurped the family name because you feel threatened 
by him? I continue.
    
Its a cheap shot to popularity. The people have rejected him 
unfortunately or fortunately. Theres no way Khalique (Murtazas 
nominee) will win the coming bye-elections. The man (Murtaza) stood 
from 35 seats and could only win a piddly seat from Larkana, which was 
thanks to his mother. Had it not been for Begum Sahiba, he would have 
lost.
    
Whats the basis of your rivalry with him?
    
People in life sometimes take directions which cannot be later 
changed...it happened to me. I dont even know the man, I have just 
met him four times, but respect is dear to every man  whoever gives 
respect begets it...even the pettiest of men  though I dont make any 
distinctions between ordinary people, syeds, pirs or mirs, be they 
blue-blooded or yellow-blooded  but in worldly way even if you talk 
to a small man who has had less opportunities in life, you dont 
disrespect him.
    
What I gather from this long-winded thesis of Zardari is that Mir 
Murtaza Bhutto perhaps looked down upon him as one not fit to marry 
Benazir Bhutto. And Zardari has not easily forgiven nor forgotten this 
insult. As this thought flits across my mind, Asif Zardari, who had 
started to roll his rosary beads, himself provided the interpretation:
    
Whether he (Murtaza) likes it or not, I am the husband of his elder 
sister and in our culture one does not talk too much in front of ones 
bahnoi (brother-in-law). As far as politics is concerned, the field is 
vast open. He has tried his best...the future will tell more.
    
Are there any chances of reconciliation between the brother and 
sister?
    
As far as politics is concerned you never close doors. Benazir Bhutto 
has been criticised for giving people a second chance, after all to 
err is human, to forgive is divine. God has given her that position, 
shes greater than the ordinary souls otherwise whats the difference 
between her and me  shes the leader and God has given her these 
qualities, unfortunately, he hasnt bestowed them on me. Again, he is 
implying that while BB may patch up with her brother some day, Asif 
Ali Zardari will never!
    
People say you are her weakness, her Achilles heel, she is too much 
under your influence?
    
Thats the other problem with society which thinks a wife has to be 
dominated by the husband. Thats not correct, because everybody has a 
charter of their own. As far as our family is concerned, yes, I have a 
say in the matter  there we take collective decisions about the 
education of our children, but as far as politics is concerned if she 
was to listen to me, Id still be in prison! How can you expect 
somebody who has never done politics, whose only exposure to politics 
was his engagement with Benazir Bhutto, to come up and give advise to 
her on politics?
    
Thats precisely what people say, I jump in. Without any political 
background, you have catapulted into the driving seat? I say.
    
Thats not true.
    
As a Leo, he says he is a home-bird: Id rather stay at home than go 
out anywhere.
    
You cut quite a dashing figure before your marriage? I ask, while 
refraining from using the word playboy  by which he was often 
labelled  in case he takes umbrage.
    
I might be offended by your remark. You mean I am not dashing any 
more? he gives his charming smile.
    
Do you want more kids? I ask.
    
I would be satisfied if we had another son  that would make two boys 
and two girls. Being the only son, I have always missed a brother and 
want the company of male individuals. It comes from a psychological 
want of a brother and thats why I converse with my heart and not my 
tongue and mind!
    
Whats BBs views about another addition to the family?
    
Its useless to discuss something thats not possible. Shes too 
busy, too overworked, there are other things in her life at the moment 
which need her attention.
    
Are you happy being married to Ms Bhutto? is my last question.
    
Happiness is relative, life is never perfect, you have to be content 
with what you have and not lust after more, theres no end to greed. 
Life is a challenge and only they live who dare!

<a name="worl">World Cup squad</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

THE announcement of the final cricket squad for the World Cup, 
scheduled to commence from mid-February, has at last ended the 
suspenseful period of anxious waiting within the country as well as 
among the other contestants in the prestigious competition. While most 
of the players selected were sure to be named, the overhanging air of 
uncertainty around one or two choices tended to create a cloudy 
climate. Javed Miandad's declaration of availability, followed by his 
demonstration of fitness and form in the field, had particularly 
become the focus of attention among keen followers of the game and 
countless fans who rooted for their hero. Conflicting statements by 
some experts, specially by Imran Khan, expressing fears about the 
veteran's ability to withstand the pressure in view of his knee and 
back trouble accentuated the existing doubts. Also, his long absence 
from the field of action gave rise to apprehensions, although his 
fairly convincing knocks in the Wills Cup matches set such misgivings 
at rest. What was, however, more worrying was the speculation, born of 
reported interviews, that Wasim Akram, the captain, and Intikhab Alam, 
the manager, had some reservations in this regard. The postponement 
and delay in making public the final list fuelled a spate of rumours 
calculated to start a controversy and vitiate the atmosphere of accord 
so vital to generate team spirit. It is gratifying that the issue has 
been resolved after due deliberation before the deadline and the door 
has presumably been slammed in the face of elements out to exploit the 
situation.

Being the World Cup holders, Pakistan occupies a central role in the 
coming event, regarded as the ultimate competition in one-day cricket. 
It is no doubt a great distinction but, at the same time, it is not a 
very enviable position to be in either, as every other team pits its 
full might against the champions and as such our boys will be 
constantly under severe strain. The responsibility to justify its 
highest rating and live up to its reputation will put tremendous 
pressure on it. Hence the need to pull its weight fully and forcefully 
with all the skill and spirit it is capable of that will be required 
to meet the stiff challenge. Besides that, despite the advantage of a 
familiar environment nearer home, the peculiar conditions obtaining in 
the area are not likely to be very conducive. Although the team is 
fairly strong on paper its age factor is not so favourable after a 
four-year gap. Moreover, the intervening years have seen many ups and 
downs. Fortunately, the worst is apparently over and an upswing is in 
evidence. But all said and done the outcome in this concentrated brand 
of cricket depends very largely on total commitment and effort without 
let or hindrance. The inspiring memories of Melbourne should serve to 
galvanise and fortify over team. With faith, self confidence and 
collective endeavour a repeat performance of 1992 in 1996 is not 
beyond reach.

<a name="ther">The real promoter of poverty</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aftab Ahmad

THE World Banks Report on Pakistan Poverty Assessment was released 
at a time when Pakistan was in desperate need of something to boost 
its morale. The report revealed that poverty in Pakistan had been 
reduced in the 1970s and 1980s and that the percentage of population 
below the poverty line had gone down from 46 percent in 1984-85 to 34 
percent in 1990-91.

However, Dr Mahbubul Haque, a former Finance Minister of Pakistan, 
doubted the authenticity of the World Banks findings and inquired how 
poverty in Pakistan could have gone down when both inflation and 
unemployment were on the rise.
    
During the decade, the average growth rate of the manufacturing sector 
was 9.93 per cent compared with 5.07 per cent of the agriculture 
sector. The manufacturing activity, at that time, was entirely in the 
hands of the private sector, which enjoyed monopolistic power and was 
guided solely by its profit motive in dealing with its workers. The 
agriculture sector was characterised by a feudal system on which the 
land reforms introduced had little impact. Hence the condition of the 
poor did not show any visible improvement. Nevertheless, the share of 
the poorest 20 per cent improved from 6.4% in 1963-64 to 8.2 per cent 
in 1968-69 whereas the share of the richest 20 per cent declined from 
45.3 per cent to 42 percent during the period.

But whereas, on the one hand, measures were taken for the welfare of 
the industrial workers and the rural poor, on the other hand, the 
political strife and confrontation witnessed during the 1970s, coupled 
with the shock effect of the reforms and fear of nationalisation, had 
an adverse effect on the performance of the economy. The average GDP 
growth rate declined from 6.77 per cent during the 1960s to 4.84 per 
cent during the 1970s, the unemployment rate increased to 3.72 per 
cent (in 1980- 81) from 1.99 per cent in 1969-70 and the annual 
inflation rate jumped to an average of 12.33 per cent. The fixed 
income groups were particularly hard-hit by the high inflation rate in 
1973-74 and 1974-75 and well to do families belonging to the salaried 
class or other fixed income groups became hand to mouth within a 
matter of weeks and months. These developments partly neutralised the 
benefits received by the poorer sections of the society in the 1970s.

During the 1980s, the economic indicators once again showed 
improvement. The average annual GDP growth rate increased to 6.45 per 
cent and the rate of inflation declined to 7.34 per cent. Perhaps the 
World Banks claim about reduction in the percentage of population 
below the poverty line in Pakistan from 46 per cent in 1984-85 to 34 
per cent in 1990-91 may have been based on the afore-mentioned higher 
GDP growth rate witnessed during the 1980s. However, by 1990-91, the 
economic indicators had considerably deteriorated. Although the GDP 
growth rate in 1990-91 stood at a respectable level of 5.57 per cent, 
the rate of inflation, had climbed to 12.7 per cent and the 
unemployment rate to 6.38 per cent. 

The dismal performance of the economy had continued during the 1990s 
so far. However, although the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 
4.74 per cent, a staggering 90,000 jobless had been added to the 
unemployed labour force during the last two years, 50,000 in the rural 
and 40,000 in the urban sector. Spiralling prices and unemployment 
were the two problems which had made the life of the common man 
miserable during the 1990s so far.

Who was the real culprit behind poverty in Pakistan? There was a 
consensus in this regard that it was the exploitative feudal and 
capitalistic system, aided by the corrupt elements in the bureaucracy, 
which had not so far permitted any change to be brought about in the 
life of the poor and the down-trodden in the country. In the rural 
sector, in spite of repeated land reforms, the possession of 
agricultural land remained concentrated in a few hands.  

In the urban sector, the governments had, from time to time, tried to 
improve the lot of the industrial workers and other salaried people 
through upward revision of pay scales, social security packages, 
labour laws, trade unionism, profit sharing arrangements etc. However, 
these measures had generally failed to bring about any significant 
change in the life of people.

In other words without replacing the prevailing exploitative system 
with a just and equitable order. The question is could that be done? 
It was difficult to answer. However, one thing was certain that the 
country had already entered an era of globalisation, international 
competition and survival of the fittest, and in order to be able to 
survive, we needed to utilise the full potential of all our people 
which would not be possible unless we replaced the old order with a 
new one.

<a name="orde">Ordeal at the airport</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

WHAT many incoming passengers, especially those arriving from abroad, 
have often to encounter at the Karachi airport is widely known but no 
one in authority seems prepared or willing to do anything about it. 
The passengers' woe begins the moment they come out of the arrival 
lounge - only to be besieged by a horde of cab drivers frantically 
trying to pick up their share of fares. Accosting of this kind can 
take the form of pure harassment regardless of whether some passengers 
are in need of the proffered service or have their own transport 
waiting for them. All norms of civility and responsible conduct are on 
sufferance when it comes to making the catch of a' prospective 
passenger and striking a profitable bargain with him over the fare to 
be paid. Incidentally, the standard practice with most cab drivers 
operating between the airport and the city is to charge the passengers 
arbitrarily and not according to the fare metre. Since all this 
happens in the presence of the police on duty, it is clear that many 
of them are in league with the errant cab drivers on a basis of the 
sharing of the loot.

And yet this is not the end but the beginning of an arriving 
passenger's ordeal. Apart from occasional cases of wayside robbery, 
passengers are often stopped at several point by uniformed or plain-
clothes policemen on the pretext of questioning, checking on ;customs 
and immigration clearance and so forth and are subjected to various 
forms of harassment. Intimidating tactics, including threats of 
physical violence or the grim prospects of spending the night in a 
police lock-up, are freely used to soften up resistance on the part of 
a passenger refusing to be bullied and treated in this highly 
offensive and illegal fashion. The purpose is to extort money or claim 
a share in whatever other precious things watches, new clothes, 
cameras and so on - that some passengers may have in their possession. 
There have been instances in the past where some foreigners on way to 
the city from the airport have been harassed and robbed by elements 
belonging to the law enforcement agencies. On occasions even 
journalists who are usually regarded with some deference for fear of 
exposure too have not been spared by these thugs.

Most of these things are within the knowledge of the authorities. 
Accounts of many such incidents of criminal harassment, exploitation 
and pure thuggery by a, section of the so-called lawmen within the 
precincts of the airport and at various points along the route to the 
city also make it clear that the perpetrators of such excesses are 
operating an organised racket in which various other elements, 
including taxi drivers, are also involved. Or else how does one 
explain some policemen out on a hunt for fortunes targeting taxis or 
cars carrying passengers from the airport that are most likely to 
yield a big loot? One plausible explanation is that they choose their 
victims on a tip-off from their collaborators at the airport who 
assess the worth of a potential prey from the size of his or her 
baggage. The authorities would do well to shed their attitude of 
benign indifference to this sordid state of affairs and take drastic 
steps to put an end to the continuing harassment and exploitation of 
air passengers at the hands of a section of security personnel.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="ptvp">PTV  PCB dispute settled; 1-day final to be televised</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, Jan 16: The final of the National One-day Tournament 
between Pakistan International Airlines and Rawalpindi A, to be played 
at Sheikhupura, will be telecast live by Pakistan Television network 
following a written no-objection by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

The fax message reaching PTV headquarters, yesterday, stated that the 
board has no objection against live coverage, news coverage or 
recording of domestic cricket matches between local teams. The no 
objection is duly signed by the chief executive.

Sources in  the PTV stated that the no objection means that the 
national network will cover the domestic cricket games amongst local 
teams free of cost.

PTV official added that they have received the reply in due time since 
a delay of one more day would have meant that the final could not have 
be covered as it requires two clear days for the televising equipment 
to be installed before any cricket fixture can be televised.

The PTV officials said that selling of televising rights of the world 
cup and their earlier agreement with IMG about the selling of domestic 
and international signals of all the matches played in Pakistan to 
different companies had cornered the corporation and there was no way 
out but to stay out before anything clear came to the surface.
  
The PTV stated that the corporation has also earned a bad name with 
its viewers who are keen to watch cricket and coverage of cricket is 
PTVs commitment to the viewers of the country. The official said that 
the network has never made money from telecasting domestic games. In 
fact production costs are much higher than the sponsorship fee paid 
out, but we cover up the cost through the coverage of international 
matches, he said.
 
The PTV officials stated that cricket coverage was becoming more and 
more expensive but the corporation is making an effort to satisfy its 
viewers as PTV paid US $120,000 just for the coverage of Sri Lankan 
series to WorldTel, plus the enormous amount of US $750,000 to cover 
world cup matches in Pakistan after PCB sold the sole rights of the 
World Cup coverage to the American company.

<a name="zama">Zaman Gul clinches Asian squash after marathon fight</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
A. Majid Khan

AMMAN, Jan.12: Pakistans Mir Zaman Gul, second seed, regained the 
Asian squash title in a final against the Hong Kong-based Abdul Fahim, 
seeded No.3, in which the whirligig of pendulum swayed to and fro for 
two hours and 15 minutes at Ammans al-Hassan Sports Complex.
    
Abdul Fahim, an experienced Pakistani who has settled in Hong Kong and 
represents the island colony, turned out to be a resilient player and 
put up a tremendous fight. The better composure and variety of strokes 
of Mir Zaman won him the day. The end of the match and the victory 
came as a considerable relief to the Pakistani camp and the 
supporters, who gave a cheerful applause to the Mir Zaman, the winner 
with a scoreline of 9-6, 8-10, 6-9, 10-8, 9-3. This was despite the 
pullout of world champion Jansher Khan because of back problem.
    
Mir Zaman Gul, world No.30, was 1-2 games down against Abdul Fahim, 
ranked No.36, when he staged an amazing comeback for a triumph in the 
final to repeat his 1990 Calcutta Asian squash performance.
    
The packed-to-capacity championship court gallery, with around 1,000 
spectators, women, watched the enthralling Asian fight for supremacy.
    
Rawalpindi - born Fahim, who had represented Pakistan in the 1990 
Asian Squash at Calcutta but later settled in Hong Kong, also came 
closer to repeat his 1992 Peshawar Asian squash winning performance 
but Gul fought a gruelling battle for Pakistans supremacy and emerged 
Asian champion a second time.
    
However, the refereeing left much to be desired and both the players 
disputed several decisions of the Jordanian supervisor who on several 
occasions could not explain why he has given a stroke or let.
    
Nevertheless it was a virtual classic encounter and the fans enjoyed 
it to the fill and cheered both the fighters.
    
Mir Zaman Gul, after winning the opener, was trapped by Fahim in slow 
rallies and committed several unforced errors. Later Gul played his 
attacking game by dislodging Fahim from the Tee and succeeded in 
winning the title for Pakistan.
    
Fahim undoubtedly gave an extraordinary performance as he produced 
several controlled drops, lobbed the ball and executed tidy angles. 
Fahim took a commanding 6-1 lead in the first game but Gul staged a 
brave comeback and caught him up 6-6 and later won the 25-minute game 
at 9-6.
    
Mir Zaman Gul was 5-4 and went 8-5 ahead. However, Gul fought 
remarkably well to make 8 - all but lost at 8-10 when he twice hit the 
board. Fahim won 10-8.
    
The third game was also a closely-fought one and after 6-6 Fahim again 
occupied the Tee and hit winners to take the game at 9-6.
    
Gul was in total command of the fourth game when he led 7-3 but seemed 
to have lost concentration and committed several unforced errors. 
Fahim was back with renewed determination and gradually narrowed the 
gap with a string of drops and angles to be 6-7.
    
Mir Zaman was 8-6 up but Fahim saved the game ball and the fight for 
every point was hard. Fahim levelled 8-8 but Mir Zaman went 9-8 with a 
stroke and when Fahim hit the tin Mir Zaman was winner at 10-8.
    
Mir Zaman started the deciding game in an assured way by maintaining a 
deadly length and Fahim came under tremendous pressure. Mir Zaman, 
after 2-2, took six points in one hand to be 8-2 and took the final 
at 9-3.

AMMAN, Jan 15: Title holders Pakistan powered their way to eighth 
successive final of the 13 nation Asian Squash Championship, 
confidently defeating hosts, Jordan, by 3-0 to take their expected 
place in tomorrow's final at the newly-built al-Hasan Squash Complex.   

Defending champions, Pakistan, even after the pullout of world number 
one Jansher Khan due to back problem during the individual 
Championship, is in a high spirits for maintaining the country's 
unprecedented domination in the Asian Team Championship.

So far in all the three previous matches Pakistan, under Zarak Jahan 
Khan, had comfortably defeated Bahrain, Sri Lanka, Kuwait by margin of 
30 and they had maintained this tempo in todays semi-final against 
Jordan who for the second time qualified for the last four.

In the playing order of 3-1-2 Zarak Jahan Khan, outmanoeuvred Jordan 
No. 3 Wael Tabalat 9-6, 9-0, 9-0 to give Pakistan a lead in the three 
match contest.

KUWAIT LOSE: Holders Pakistan, favoured to regain the trophy for the 
eighth successive time, inflicted a 3-0 defeat on fighting Kuwait on 
their way to semi-finals where they will be opposed by hosts Jordan 
who reached the last four, a second time by beating Singapore in the 
Asian Squash Championship at the Al-Hasan Complex.

India again suffered a setback when a youthful Malaysian side composed 
of with the talented youth, recorded an emphatic 3-0 victory.

Malaysia will be up in the semi-final against Hong Kong who 
comfortably defeated Sri Lanka by 3-0. Both semi-finals are scheduled 
tomorrow.

Though Pakistan won by 3-0 against Kuwait, the performance of world 
No. 11 Zarak and Asian Champion Mir Zaman Gul, the world No. 30 were 
unimpressive after unfit Zubair disposed of Ahmed Sultan 9-0, 9-5, 9-0 
in 28 minutes.

Captain Zarak Jahan in the second match had to struggle to overcome 22 
year-old Faisal Sultan of Kuwait in a close fight before winning it in 
one hour and ten minutes with a score of 9-0. 2-9.10-8. 9-2.

Asian Champion Mir Zaman Gul also dropped a game against Kuwaitis 18-
year-old Ahmed Sultan before winning it 9-7, 9-3, 9-10, 9-6. The match 
lasted 43 minutes.


Other results of the morning.

Kuwait beat Lebanon 3-0, Jordan beat S. Korea 3-0, Sri Lanka beat 
Bahrain 2-1, India beat Taipei 3-0, Singapore beat Palestine 3-0.

Women: Singapore beat Lebanon 3-0, India beat Sri Lanka 2-1.

SHARJAH, Jan 11: India finally did justice to their abilities and 
avoided the embarrassment of returning home without a victory. But it 
wasn't all that easy to defuse a charged-up Pakistan - they always are 
when playing against India - in a truncated playoff for the third 
place in the NEPC World Masters Cricket Series at Sharjah.

Indian masters, chasing 162 for a victory in 28 overs (reduced from 
normal 45 because of rain in the morning), kept their cool when it 
mattered most and coasted home with five balls to spare.

LAHORE, Jan 12: Master batsman Javed Miandad has been included in the 
14-member Pakistan cricket team which will defend its title in the 
sixth World Cup Cricket Tournament being jointly hosted by Pakistan, 
India and Sri Lanka from February 14 to March 17. The world-class 
batsman is the only player who is destined to represent his country in 
all the World Cup.

Miandad has so far played in 228 games and have scored 7,327 runs with 
eight centuries and 50 half centuries. He is the second leading scorer 
in limited overs game after Desmond Haynes who has more than 8,000 
runs against his name.
    
Also to earn selectors vote was off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq who has 
been preferred over Akram Raza. Saqlain made his debut against Sri 
Lanka and has so far played only against Australia besides the 
Islanders. Ramiz Raja has also been retained in the team after his 
good show with the bat. Akram has made way for Ataur Rahman whose 
performance is not very encouraging at the international level.
