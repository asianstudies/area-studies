<a name="ward">War declared against corruption, says PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Oct 20: Immediately after delivering an  all- encompassing 90- 
minute speech in the National Assembly , prior to the introduction of an 
anti- corruption bill on Sunday, a confident -looking prime minister told 
Dawn in her chambers that she had declared war against all kinds of 
corruption.
    
Reiterating high points of her speech, in the company of PML(J) chief Hamid 
Nasir Chattha, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said with a broad smile that 
she felt she had taken the wind out of the sails of the opposition by 
offering herself as the first case for accountability under the proposed 
new law. Mr Chattha agreed with her completely. He also praised her for 
offering immunity to the leader of the opposition and thought she had 
scored a political point thereby.
    
The prime minister said she was fed up with the never-ending but 
unsubstantiated stories of alleged corruption involving her and her husband 
and wanted the matter to be settled once and for all.
    
She explained that special prosecutors, mentioned in the proposed law, 
could even be expatriate Pakistani lawyers of high repute, having no axe of 
their own to grind.
    
She said that because of polarisation in the country, lawyers of integrity 
like Dorab Patel had become extinct and, therefore, she thought qualified 
special prosecutors of high integrity would have to be imported to try 
cases which would be referred to the proposed parliamentary commission on 
eradication of corruption.

<a name="extr">Extra-budget steps to yield Rs40bn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Oct. 22; The Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Muhammad 
Yaqub, on Tuesday presented a package providing for a heavy tax-loaded 
second wholesome budget to raise additional revenue of Rs13 billion and 
generate savings of Rs27 billion  Rs20 billion by cutting down on 
development programme and Rs7 billion by applying an economy cut on current 
expenditure. The package also pushed dollar exchange value up by 8.5 per 
cent from Rs36.97 to Rs40.12.
    
Speaking at a Press conference here on Tuesday he also announced a 3 per 
cent increase in the SBP 3 Day Repo Rate against Short Term Federal Bonds 
(STFB) and Federal Investment Bond (FIB). The new Repo Rate is 20 per cent 
per year as against 17 per cent.
    
For the first time, a State Bank governor announced the fiscal measures, 
which Dr Yaqub said he was doing on the instructions of the prime minister 
who wanted him to unfold the monetary and fiscal measures of the package. 
She did not want announcement of monetary measures in Karachi and fiscal 
measures in Islamabad, he said.
    
Identifying it as Economic Stability and Reforms Package, Dr Yaqub 
claimed that it was not sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
but developed under the direct guidance of the prime minister without 
touching the budgetary allocation for national defence.
    
They accepted this package as the basis for the implementation and to 
carry forward the Standby Arrangement, the SBP governor informed newsmen 
while referring to his consultation with the IMF and World Bank officials 
in Washington and added that its successful implementation will lay the 
foundation for a shift from Standby Arrangement to long-term Extended 
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) from next fiscal year.
    
He announced that an IMF team would reach Pakistan this weekend for 
documentation of the Standby Arrangement to review the implementation of 
the package reforms. The team, he said, would quickly prepare the staff 
report and present it to the IMF Board meeting next month.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Report

KARACHI, Oct 22: Consumers representing various economic groups were 
shocked and unanimous in slamming the fiscal measures announced in an 
unprecedented manner by the State Bank Governor on Tuesday.
    
Prices of pulses, sugar, powdered milk, petroleum products, and other 
essential items instantly increased as was the case with medicines.
    
The general public was agitated and blamed the civil and military rulers 
for the present state of affairs. They were of the view that there was a 
need for a drastic cut in non- development expenditure.
    
Dr Azra Talat Sayeed, research director of Pakistan Institute of Labour 
Education and Research, said that under the present economic conditions 
nobody exactly knew where the present situation would lead to.
    
She said: Ours is basically an importing country, and the present 
devaluation would result in an overall price spiral which would seriously 
affect the majority in this country who earn a low income. These people 
constitute 60 per cent of our population.
    
She said in Karachi 40 per cent of the population live in kachchi abadis 
and of these 20 per cent live below the poverty line.

Kulsoom Begum was of the view that she had already closed down her social 
welfare project because of the budgetary gap in the organisations 
activities, which could never be bridged under the given economic 
situation.

Mrs Nabeela Akram, who generates around Rs 6,000 per month by running a 
small tailor shop said that only a few month ago she had to shift her two 
children from a reputed English medium school to an ordinary one for she 
was not able to pay their fees. I am sure with the new taxation and 
increase in the cost of living I shall have to withdraw at least one of my 
three school going children from the school, she lamented.

People at the market places generally held corrupt politicians, bureaucrats 
and business tycoons as being responsible for the perpetual pressure on the 
economy. Many expressed the view that time had come when the nation must 
think of brining a drastic change in the system.

<a name="petr">Petroleum prices raised by 10pc</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Ziauddin 

ISLAMABAD, Oct 22: The government on Tuesday increased the prices of 
petroleum products by 10 per cent as pass-through of the rupee depreciation 
of 8. 5 per cent against the dollar, announced earlier in the day.
    
This is the second increase in petroleum prices this month. Earlier, on 
October 7, the prices were increased by an average of 5 per cent on the 
plea that international oil prices had gone up.
    
And in the current financial year, this is the third increase as, on August 
20, prices of some of the petroleum products were increased apparently for 
no rhyme or reason.
    
The government started the current financial year with an insignificant 
decrease in petroleum prices on July 22 , which seemed to be a follow- up 
to another similar decrease in these prices on June 12.
    
With the latest increase of 10 per cent, not only the advantage of the 
earlier decreases have been wiped out but an average of 20 per cent 
increase in the prices of petroleum have also occurred since June this 
year.

The new (old) prices of gasoline are as follows: Motor Gasoline (regular) -  
16.51(15.85) and  Motor Gasoline 17.6337(16.9584).

<a name="murt">Murtaza Bhuttos death and trial </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Kunwar Idrees

Observing the events of today and recalling the past years as a magistrate, 
I get a sad overwhelming feeling that Mr Murtaza Bhuttos killers will 
never be caught and punished. Look at the facts which give rise to this 
feeling:
    
- The alleged killers are also the complainants.
    
- The police has refused to register the FIR giving version of the incident 
from the side of Murtaza, Ashiq Jatoi and the other five killed.
    
- The trial, whenever it takes place, would be of their guards who escaped 
death for causing injury to the policemen who intercepted them, obstructing 
public servants in the performance of their duty and a host of other 
offences. Had Murtaza by miracle survived the six bullets pumped into his 
body he too would have been an accused.
    
- There are no eyewitnesses other than the members of the police force or 
the surviving companions of Murtaza. The former will inevitably support 
their own version and the latter will be standing in the dock as accused.
    
- The most crucial witness, Inspector Haq Nawaz Sial, who could have belied 
the prosecution story under the stress of cross- examination died in 
mysterious circumstances within days of the incident. No one has been 
arrested or charged with his murder despite the protestations of his family 
and the medical report belying the suicide theory.
    
- Contrary to the police version of firing in self-defence, the prime 
minister has alleged it was a conspiracy to kill her brother, and yet in 
the same breath she has excluded from the conspirators the senior 
superintendent of police who admittedly directed the whole operation from a 
close but safe distance.
    
Currently the focus is on the judicial enquiry and not on the crime and 
hauling up its perpetrators. Even if the police versions of firing in self-
defence were to be accepted, the important point to the determined would 
remain whether the force used was proportionate to the threat posed. By the 
evidence published, even if it were to be fully relied upon, it was not 
Seven men were mowed down in return for bullets grazing the thigh of one 
police official and heel of another. Surely if Murtazas escort fired first 
with automatic weapons it would have caused a far more serious damage. Thus 
even the opportunity of proving that the force used was excessive even if 
it was used in self-defence is being denied to the aggrieved party for the 
users of the force will not be on trial.
    
The wives of Murtaza Bhutto and Ashiq Jatoi have done to the High Court 
seeking direction to the police for the registration of its FIR against the 
policemen for murdering their husbands and five of their escorts. There 
Hafeez Pirzada with his fine brain and fat fee will argue for days on end 
while the widows evidence with all its inherent weaknesses will continue 
to weaken further because all those who could possibly be accused of murder 
or exceeding the right of self-defence would remain free and in positions 
of authority.
    
Almost a month to the gruesome tragedy which grieved all, friend or foe, 
and shook the government to its foundation the judicial tribunal is yet to 
be constituted. The terms of enquiry if drawn have not been declared yet. 
But one thing is obvious: it will be long drawn out and contentious 
proceedings and while it lasts the trial whether of the first set of 
accused - Murtazas surviving men  or of the policemen, if the widows 
plea in the High Court succeeds, will not proceed. Meanwhile even the 
remnants of the evidence that remain too will disappear. Whatever the 
judicial enquiry might bring out it will not convict anyone.
    
Keeping politics aside, in the circumstances where seven men got killed by 
firing, fairness demands that the trial should proceed on the basis of 
murder. In the course of the trial the police can adduce evidence to show 
that the firing was in self-defence and the force used was the minimum 
necessary to save their own lives. Compelling the widows to go to the High 
Court to establish this basis of trial also brings to ridicule the prime 
ministers public allegation that the death of her brother was the result 
of a conspiracy. Whether her allegation is right or not can be established 
only through a murder trial and not by settling down with the self-defence 
theory. Historically also whenever someone is killed by violence, unless 
the death is undoubtedly accidental, as in a road fall or in traffic 
accident, the plea of self-defence is vindicated through trial for murder.
    
The known circumstances make Murtazas case least eligible for departure 
from that established practice for our criminal law.
    
Another important aspect of impartial investigation and a prompt and fair 
trial is restoring public confidence in the law enforcing authority to the 
degree it can be in the all pervading cynicism. When the brother of the 
incumbent prime minister and brother-in-law of former one are shot dead by 
police in the safest area of the city what becomes of the ordinary mortals 
who constantly live on the edge of disaster is a question dominating all 
minds.
    
The Clifton deaths are but a ghastly manifestation of the demoralisation 
and brutalisation both of the society and authority under Zias long 
dictatorship and since its demise under series of faltering, corrupting 
elected governments. The State has been reduced to a fief. This tragic 
moment should be used to return to the rule of law, and not smother it 
further under orchestrated pleas of self-defence. Curses, they say, like 
chickens come home to roost. They have once. They should not again. Wracked 
by violence and conflict the country needs peace and reconciliation.

In these grieving moments of his tragic death an irresponsible thought 
nevertheless arises whether the country has been spared another turbulent 
chapter in its troubled existence.

<a name="isla">Islamabad New City project : People should be cautious</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, October 23: The Senate Standing Committee on Housing and Works 
has warned the general public to take extra care while investing in 
Islamabad New City project.
    
The committee after minutely studying the feasibility and practicability of 
the project in its last meeting concluded that the project management 
expect for alluring expatriate and collecting huge sums of money from them 
have done nothing on ground to develop the project as promised in the 
brochures, Chairman of the Committee Brig (Retd) Malik Muhammad Hayyat said 
in a statement on Wednesday.
    
He said the committee at its next meeting would review the whole project 
and would also summon the project managers to obtain a briefing on the 
progress made by them.
    
He said the committee was of the view that the management instead of 
developing the scheme had been lavishly spending the money obtained from 
small investors.
    
Malik Hayyat told Dawn that the land acquired by the developers of New City 
was in bits and pieces and they had done no demarcation or set up a fence. 
He said thousands of people were living in the project area who were not 
ready to sell their land.  It might take them a century to acquire the 
total area required for developing the project, he said.
    
He said the area as shown on the maps should be at least four miles in 
length and two to three miles in width.
    
He said they had claimed to bring in foreign investment and technology to 
under take such a huge project but no foreign investment or the technology 
has come in.
    
The newsmen would also be invited to attend the next meeting in which the 
developers would be summoned to give a briefing on the progress of the 
project. He called upon the newsmen to let the people know about the facts 
of the project so that they would not fall prey.

<a name="paki">Pakistan fails to get IMF pledge</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai 

WASHINGTON, Oct 19: Pakistan on Friday succeeded in persuading the IMF to 
urgently send a mission to Pakistan on Oct 24, but a joint statement 
released after the talks confirmed that Islamabad would have to implement a 
number of "prior actions" before any commitment for release of the 
suspended $600 million standby loan was made.
    
The limited success for top Pakistani negotiators came at the last moment 
as they desperately pleaded that the IMF urgently dispatch a mission and in 
return they agreed to meet all the necessary requirements which would 
include immediate announcement of a mini-budget that would implement some 
of the conditions laid down by the Fund.
    
An 80-word joint statement released by the embassy of Pakistan after 
intensive talks on Friday, extended several times before the Pakistani 
delegation left for the airport straight from the IMF headquarters, 
indicated the IMF had put in place a schedule comprising several stages 
before the Fund could consider the release of the money.
    
It said: "An agreement has been reached between the Pakistan delegation and 
the staff and management of the IMF on stabilisation and reform policies.
    
"In light of this, a mission would arrive in Pakistan on October 24 to 
finalise a letter of intent, with a view to completing the review under the 
stand-by arrangement.

"These 80 words mean that Pakistan has conceded to take a number of steps 
before the IMF mission reached Pakistan and these would be tough, bitter 
measures," an IMF expert told 'Dawn.'
    
The expert explained that the "agreement" which the two sides had mentioned 
in their statement was on the reform policies that need to be adopted and 
it should not be misconstrued or mis-interpreted as an accord for the 
release of any money to Pakistan.
    
He noted that unlike the past when the IMF would hold discussions and 
instantly agree to sign the loan, this time Pakistan had been asked to go 
through a series of steps before the IMF begins considering the stand by 
loan review.
    
"The key two words in this joint statement are 'prior actions' and this 
clearly means that the IMF had told Pakistan government that unless these 
measures were 'not just announced' but 'properly implemented', IMF would 
not be proceeding any further with the loan talks," the IMF expert said.
    
"Once the Fund was satisfied with the prior actions and agreement was 
reached on the letter of intent, only then the review of the stand by loan 
would begin and then the mission would report to its board whether the loan 
programme should be approved," the expert said.
    
In essence the IMF has stuck to its demands that Pakistan must show "by its 
deeds" and not "by its words" what it could achieve to satisfy the IMF 
conditionalities before any loans could be approved.

<a name="fore">Foreign loan payments may exceed $5bn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Oct 20: Pakistans foreign exchange payments exceeded the 
staggering figure of $4.2 billion in 1995-96 for servicing and amortisation 
of long, medium and short-term liabilities.
    
Banking circles predict escalation in the foreign exchange payments this 
year to service and amortise the interest and principal amounts of long, 
medium and short-term foreign debts because of rise in short-term 
borrowings at commercial rates in the current fiscal year.
    
It could go up to $5 billion in 1996-97 if the trade gap is not contained 
below $3 billion level, a senior banker said.
    
According to these sources a sum of about $2.2 billion was paid during 
1995-96 on account of servicing the interest and amortisation of principal 
amounts of short and medium-term liabilities which are not reflected in the 
budget.
    
While about $2 billion were paid to amortise the principal amounts for the 
short and medium-term liabilities over $300 million were paid on account of 
interest accrued on these liabilities.

Foreign exchange payments of over $4 billion to service the foreign loans 
in 1995-96 constituted almost 45 per cent of the total foreign exchange 
earnings amounting to $8.6 billion.
    
Even if the exports achieve the $10 billion target in 1996-97 which 
appears pretty difficult to achieve, the total foreign payments expected to 
be made at about $5 billion would be exactly 50 per cent, a financial 
expert said and believed that by all standards it was a very alarming 
picture.

<a name="rupe">Rupee lowered by 8.5 per cent against dollar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct.22: The Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Muhammad 
Yaqub, on Tuesday announced a 8.5 per cent downward exchange adjustment in 
rupee pushing the dollar up to Rs40.12 from Rs36.97. He also sounded a 
stern warning to money changers blaming them for rumour-mongering and 
speculation about devaluation.
    
I am having a very critical look at the role of money changers the SBP 
governor remarked at a Press conference here. He, however, did not 
elaborate on the action he intends to take against the money changers.

The downward adjustment in rupee value with dollar has been made in the 
wake of violent kerb trading of dollar in the open market during last 48 
hours, when rupee fell to a new low at Rs40.55 a dollar on Monday amidst 
strong reports that dollars were just not available. Strangely, many 
leading money exchangers were predicting a downward adjustment of 8.5 per 
cent in rupee value within a day or two, a local foreign exchange dealer 
said.
    
However, Tuesdays decision to adjust dollar exchange value apparently did 
not bring any respite to kerb trading as the dollar was reported to have 
been traded at over Rs43 in the early morning session when greenbacks were 
scarce in the market. Finally, the dollar ended at Rs42.62 in buying and 
Rs42.70 in selling showing a difference of over Rs 2.50 a dollar, enough to 
cause worries to the monetary authorities.

<a name="chan">Change of govt can lead to good investment climate</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Oct 23: A move by President Leghari to dismiss the Benazir 
government and appoint a caretaker regime of experts might lead to more 
responsible taxation and spending policies and return the focus to what 
could be a relatively good investment climate, the authoritative Wall 
Street Journal said in a report published on Wednesday.
    
In a detailed report on Pakistan's latest mini-budget which it called 
"moves to treat economic ills," the paper said the new fiscal restraints 
were not likely to satisfy disgruntled businesses.
    
The report was filed by Timothy Mapes of the Ap-Dow Jones News Service and 
was published with a chart showing the slide of the Pakistani rupee against 
the dollar.
    
The report said: "Many argue that only a change in the political and 
economic leadership can restore business confidence in the economy over the 
long term. The trouble is that it is not clear who could do a better job at 
running Pakistan."
    
It said: "With Opposition to the Bhutto government divided and relatively 
weak, many people are looking to President Farooq Leghari to take on a 
bigger role and perhaps even dismiss the present government and appoint a 
caretaker regime of experts."

The report said the government's statistics painted an upbeat picture as Mr 
Jafarey expected economic output to grow about six per cent this year, the 
same as in 1995.
    
But it quoted the President of the FPCCI, Ilyas Ahmed Bilour as saying the 
economy was in shambles.

It said Pakistan's businessmen were increasingly vocal about what they see 
as long standing mismanagement by the government and their complaints run 
far deeper than excess state spending.
    
"Business's list of headaches reads like a compendium of the problems 
facing the developing world: Pakistan government spends too much, then runs 
up a huge debt to pay for it. Corruption is rampant from the lowest clerk 
to the top leadership. Factional killings and strikes regularly paralyse 
Karachi, the commercial capital. Imports far outpace exports, leading to 
regular currency devaluations. Big landlords, known as feudals, dominate 
Parliament and block change," it said.

<a name="farm">Farm tax at long last?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
R.M.U. Suleman

YIELDING to rising pressure at home as well as abroad, the chief ministers 
of all the four provinces have just agreed to tax the incomes of feudals. 
After a lengthy meeting at the Aiwan-e-Sadr, attended by the Prime 
Minister, her economic aides and four chief ministers, it was agreed in 
principle that the agriculture income tax should be levied on big landlords 
beginning this year. Is it that simple that it can bring some substantial 
yield just this year? This is a proposition the validity of which only time 
will tell.
    
Initially, the provincial governors are expected to levy the tax through an 
ordinance which later on, will be discussed and passed by the respective 
provincial assemblies. According to rules, the assembly has to pass or 
reject a law within 90 days.
    
The ordinance will be issued after the provinces complete their estimates 
of the revenue collection through this levy. The revenue collection 
estimates, based on Produce Index Units (PIUs), will be completed within a 
two weeks time.
    
The President, who chaired the meeting, had put in a lot of effort to 
convene the chief ministers that the imposition of tax would immensely 
benefit the provinces and expedite the work there. The very fact that the 
meeting was presided over by the President and not the Prime Minister is 
very significant. It signified that the indignities suffered by Pakistan at 
I.M.F. and the countrys rapid progression up the global scale of 
corruption has considerably weakened the position of the PM and 
strengthened that of the President.
    
The PM has the advantage of mass appeal. The President has the great 
advantage of sound administrative grounding at the bureaucratic as well as 
varied political levels both in positions of governance and those of a 
seriously harassed opposition.
    
The President could not long ignore the PMs habit of riding roughshod over 
the people around her. Nor could he long remain satisfied with his free 
hand only in D.G. Khan matters and not the long-denied and cherished 
decisive say in Punjab affairs. Finally, he realised that unprecedented 
spread of corruption and serious snub from I.M.F. posed a danger not only 
to the government but also the state.
    
This was a situation that, the President perhaps concluded, demanded not a 
division but sharing of powers. Associating the Leader of the Opposition 
and the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in evolving anti-corruption laws 
and appointing special judges and Ombudsmen for prosecution and 
adjudication of these laws is perhaps just the first stage in the sharing 
of powers. In the meeting at the President House, a comparative statement 
was also provided to the chief ministers carrying details of gains the 
provinces would get once they implement the farm tax. The meeting was told 
that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund would release funds 
for development projects if only the farm tax was imposed.

Angry feudal lobby
    
Farm income tax, constitutionally a provincial subject, has already been 
imposed half-heartedly in Sindh, the Northwest Frontier Province, and 
Balochistan. The Punjab, however, has opposed the agriculture income tax 
tooth and nail. The provincial legislators, irrespective of their political 
and religious differences, have unanimously passed a number of resolutions 
condemning the introduction of this tax. The feudal lobby in Punjab is so 
strong that it has been threatening the successive governments of political 
instability if the farm tax was imposed.
    
Two committees were set up to look into the problems of irrigation, the 
distribution of water and the drainage systems. A committee, headed by 
Ghulam Mustafa Khar, the Minister for Water and Power, will finalise 
recommendations to improve the working of Pakistan Irrigation and Drainage 
Authority (PIDC). The committee has been directed to submit its report 
within two weeks. The Khar committee will churn out ways to make the canal 
command units functional.
    
There are 42 canal command units all over the country and the government 
and the World Bank wanted to improve the irrigation system through their 
enhanced contribution. This amounts partly to privatisation. Presently 80 
per cent of the water distribution system is with the provincial 
governments and the rest 20 per cent with the federal government. The 
revenues, generated through this system, go to the federal and the 
provincial governments with the same ratio.
    
After privatisation the federal and the provincial governments will be 
deprived of this revenue source. The decrease in revenue will be met 
through farm tax revenue collection. The net benefit in the bargain will be 
rational pricing and distribution and making the water demand-rather than 
supply-oriented. Through realistic water rates and their strict 
enforcement, enough funds would also become available to spend on sound 
operation and management of our key irrigation infrastructure.
    
The second committee will scrutinise the problems of the National Drainage 
Programme (NDP). This committee, headed by Ashfaq Mehmud, Secretary Water, 
would submit its report within 10 days. The issues related to National 
Finance Commission also came under discussion and a number of decisions 
were taken.
    
A new softer package proposed by the Governor, State Bank of Pakistan, and 
the Premiers economic adviser, has already been dispatched to Washington 
after its approval by the President. The package will be discussed with the 
IMF by Shahid Hassan Khan, Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Economy 
and Dr. Muhammad Yaqub, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, who have already 
left for the United States.
    
The package carries fresh proposals for new taxation and heavy cut on 
expenditure besides commitment for the imposition of farm tax. There are 
fifty-fifty chances of convincing the IMF to accept this softer package and 
get the release of the stuck-up loan tranche of $80 million.
    
Mr.V.A. Jafarey, the de facto finance minister and Adviser to the Prime 
Minister on Finance and Economy, has, according to some reports, refused to 
endorse the new set of proposals and declined to accompany the economic 
team to Washington for negotiations with the IMF. Jafarey feared that the 
IMF would not agree to the package.
    
After the announcement of the budget in June this year a two-member team of 
the International Monetary Fund had come to Pakistan and suggested to the 
authorities here to levy an additional Rs8 billion taxes which would 
improve the economic situation. The IMF suggestion was turned down by 
Jafarey saying Things will be pretty good in two months time and the 
macro-economic situation will be far better.

Prolonged sickness 
    
Pakistan, however, did not recover from economic sickness and the IMF, this 
time, asked the visiting Pakistani team to levy Rs 10 billion additional 
taxes to achieve the 4 per cent budget deficit and other macro-economic 
targets. It would have been a political Harakiri for the government to 
agree to the IMF prescription. V.A. Jafarey had, however, recommended to 
the government to accede to Fund proposals but the government refused to 
agree to this measure. The package prepared by Jafarey would have jacked up 
the input prices, crippling the already under-pressure local industrial 
sector.
    
Mr.V.A. Jafarey is a very seasoned bureaucrat familiar with all the 
provincial and federal taxes. A little known fact about him is that at one 
time he was a spirited opponent of imposing federal income tax on larger 
agricultural incomes. The enabling law for this tax was pushed through by 
Z.A.Bhutto, in provinces with the help of the Emergency powers that he then 
enjoyed.
    
Strange are the ways of the bureaucracy. Work on implementation of the 
enabling law continued even when ZAB was no more. A final paper was 
prepared and this scribe had some hand in it. To discuss sit a 
comprehensive federal-provincial meeting, presided over by AGN Kazi, 
another seasoned bureaucrat, was held at the P- Block. 
  
There was nothing surprising in all the provincial representatives still 
opposing the new unconventional tax talking of presumptive incomes and 
PIUs. 
  
What was surprising was that as Secretary, Planning and Development, Mr. 
V.A. Jafarey had also joined hands with the provincial representatives on 
the ground that the new tax lacked administrative feasibility. Nothing 
could, however, stop A.G.N. Kazi from the single-minded pursuit of 
implementation till quite late in the day, when Ghulam Ishaq Khan, then 
Secretary General-in-Chief casually dropped in the meeting and after non-
committal participation for a while, took A.G.N. Kazi to his room, leaving 
all the participants in sullen expectancy.
    
After about half an hour, Kazi returned and called the meeting to order and 
started a long summarisation of the two conflicting views expressed at the 
meeting. Finally, he announced that he himself had moved from one camp to 
the other and abruptly adjourned the meeting. 
   
Those who had been working on the draft for months or years followed him to 
his room to ask what was thence to be done.
    
He was as usual very calm and clear. The whole matter now goes back to the 
Central Board of Revenue, which simply meant forgetting the whole issue as 
he had forgotten it. Issues, of course, never really die.

<a name="spot">Spotting tax evaders need of the hour</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

PAKISTAN NEEDS an additional Rs 45 to 50 billion annually to modestly run 
its day-to-day financial affairs and both the Central Board of Revenue 
(CBR) and the World Banks studies advise the government to find new 
resources by effectively recovering agriculture income tax and detecting 
tax evaders throughout the country.
    
The government is said to have accepted the proposals after having been 
convinced that there were no other means to increase the low tax base in 
the absence of which the financial crunch is so imminent that it could pose 
a threat to the government which may face difficulties in paying salaries 
to its employees.
    
The example in this regard was being given of the NWFP government which was 
believed to be facing an acute funding problem, forcing it to cut its non-
development expenditure by at least 20 to 25 per cent.
    
Except for Punjab, all the tree provinces are running on overdrafts from 
the State Bank, insiders claimed. The State Bank is reported to have 
advised the provinces to live within their means and they would not be 
offered additional money even if the federal government wished so. This has 
happened due to autonomous status given to the central bank on the 
insistence of the IMF and the World Bank.
    
The CBR told the federal authorities that it should not be asked to 
continue searching for more and more tax payers and that now it was the 
turn of the agriculturist lobby to pay their due taxes as was demanded by 
both the multilateral lending agencies. A study said that the CBR under the 
present circumstances could generate Rs 10 to 15 billion more, especially 
because of the leakages and ineffective laws which provide cover to 
taxpayers to escape taxes.
    
But more emphasis has reportedly been given in the World Bank study which 
called for urgently taking up the issue of low revenue generation before it 
was too late. It said that the entire agricultural system has to be 
improved and decentralised so that Rs 50 billion could be recovered in 
agriculture income tax annually out of Rs 550 billion earned by the landed 
gentry of the country.
    
Immediately after the top level meeting held in the Aiwan-e-Sadr on Sunday, 
the agriculturists of both PPP and the Muslim League (N) are said to have 
joined hands to scuttle the governments move to levy agriculture income 
tax.
    
Reports from Lahore revealed that there have been some secret meetings 
between Punjabs feudal MPAs and MNAs belonging to the ruling and 
opposition parties at which it was decided that all efforts and resources 
be pooled to resist levying of tax on their farm income.
    
This would be the fourth time when the landed gentry would coalesce to 
resist this tax. It is to be seen whether this time again the government 
would fail to enforce its decision.
    
The question now being asked by the IMF and the World bank is that under 
the present circumstances, there is no hope that Pakistan could re-pay its 
future debts due to which they are highly sceptical about the viability of 
the whole financial system in Pakistan, said an official of the Ministry 
of Finance. The levying of farm tax is necessary not only to secure foreign 
loans but also make the countrys financial system running.
    
It was in that backdrop that officials of the Ministry of Finance and CBR 
were said to have forcefully presented their point of view at Sundays 
meeting at the President House asking the top people to help levy the farm 
tax. President Farooq Leghari, who himself is a big landlord reportedly 
promised to help levy this new tax. Except for Punjab, legislations have 
been enacted by three provincial assemblies but there was no effective 
recovery of this tax. Now Punjab was expected not only to legislate an 
early bill but also recover farm tax.
    
During the Junejo government, a move was made to impose agriculture income 
tax but without any result. Dr. Mehboobul Haq, then finance minister, tried 
to levy this tax with the help of the present PML(J) President Chaudhry 
Hamid Nasir Chatta. His efforts did not bear fruit. The doctor told this 
correspondent when asked about the issue, that the agriculturist lobby was 
so strong that he could not do anything. However, he admitted that if the 
late Zia ul Haq had wanted, this could have been done along with the 
building of the controversial Kalabagh Dam. It was my assessment that our 
landed gentry earns annually about Rs 600 billion and do not pay Rs 100 
billion as their taxes, he said, adding that on the basis of his study, 
the World Bank made its late study, asking the government to go for the 
farm tax. During the first and now second government of Ms. Benazir Bhutto, 
people from within the party resisted the bill. And on forefront was the 
MNA from Gujrat, Nawabzada Ghazanfar Gul, who manoeuvred with the 
opposition members to frustrate the efforts of Ms. Bhutto to impose the 
tax.
    
With the decision on farm tax, arguments were still going on that the CBR 
should also be taken to task and that it should not be allowed to only seek 
additional revenue from landlord lobby.
    
As a matter of fact the CBR has not been able to effectively increase 
revenue generation. Though it has always planned to recover additional 
taxes every year but who does not know that they revise their targets 
downward during the year. It happened in 1995-96 and 1996-97.
    
The CBRs current year target of Rs 41 billion has already been lowered. 
Some say this time they will have at least Rs 15 billion less recovery on 
account of concessions and exemptions given in the GST while others 
maintain the shortfall will be about Rs 8 billion.
    
Nevertheless everybody is convinced that the overall recovery position is 
not satisfactory. It is said while the population of the country is 
increasing, revenues are not increasing, rather they are on the decline.
    
Political pundits say that there is no likelihood for immediate change of 
the government and that the danger is not that much imminent. They say that 
the government would listen to the dictates of the President who enjoys the 
support of the army and the judiciary. And if new taxes are levied; 
corruption halted to some extent, then maybe the government will be allowed 
to complete its term.
    
Insiders said that during the last few high level meetings at Aiwan-e-Sadr, 
it was pointed out that Junejo, Ms. Bhuttos first government and the Nawaz 
administration were all removed on the charges on corruption but the menace 
could not be eliminated. Therefore, some other means be adopted to do the 
needful, instead of dismissing the government.

<a name="kse1">KSE 100-share breaks 1,400-point barrier</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 23: The KSE 100-share index on Wednesday broke the barrier of 
1,400 points as base shares came in for strong renewed support at the lower 
levels. Volume soared to 30m shares from an average figure of 15m shares 
after about three months.
    
The index was last quoted at 1,431.74 as compared to 1,393.63 a day earlier 
as most of the base shares maintained their upward drive on active follow-
up support.
    
The opening was itself fairly promising as the post-budget buying euphoria 
remained at the peak level owing to conflicting perceptions about the 
impact of the devaluation. But it was largely the foreign-fund buying, 
which kept the market in a good mood all through the session despite the 
fact that local leading investors were still in two minds about the 
direction of the market. Some of the local institutional traders were, 
however, back in the rings and made extensive buying on selected counters. 
    
"The acceptance of the current economic stabilisation and financial reform 
package could lead to uninterrupted resumption of foreign aid in the coming 
years and appears to be the chief inspiring force behind the revival of 
foreign demand", most floor brokers believe. 
    
Energy shares led the market advance after an across the board 10 per cent 
increase in prices of petroleum products. But the outstanding gainers among 
the distribution giants, notably Shell Pakistan and PSO, which rose by Rs 
7.50 to 11. Hub-Power, which was massively traded on strong foreign buying 
followed them, rising by Rs 1.60 and so did some other energy shares.
    
Bank shares followed them after an increase of three per cent in the mark-
up rates and recovered in unison, major gainers among them being MCB, 
Faysal Bank, KASB & Co, Bank of Punjab, Union and Askari Bank. Among the 
chemical shares, BOC Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser, Engro Chemicals and some 
others were leading gainers on active short-covering at the lower levels. 
Some of the leading textile shares also came in for active support but 
being the chief beneficiary of the devaluation they failed to respond 
bullishly as they should have at the current lower levels. Synthetic shares 
performed well under the lead of Dewan Salman, National Fibre, and Dhan 
Fibre on active support at the lower levels.
    
Losses on the other hand were mostly fractional and reflected lack of 
support rather than large selling from any quarters. However, Zeal Pak 
Cement, Parke-Davis, Brooke Bond and Quality Steel fell with an extended 
decline of one rupee to Rs 1.75.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, up Rs 1.60 on 10.563m shares 
followed by PTC vouchers, higher Rs 1.05 on 8.174m, ICI Pakistan (r) firm 
40 paisa on 1.461m, Fauji Fertiliser, higher Rs 2.85 on 0.922m and Dewan 
Salman, up Rs 1.40 on 0.784m shares.
    
The other actively traded shares were led by MCB, firm Rs 2.40 on 0.615m, 
ICI Pakistan, steady 25 paisa on 0.378m, NDLC, firm 10 paisa on 0.325m and 
Bank of Punjab, up one rupee on 0.281m shares. There several other notable 
deals also.
    
Trading volume rose further to 29.691m shares from the previous 22.794m 
shares thanks to active dealings in Hub-Power. There were 268 actives, 
which came in for trading, out of which 152 shares rose, while 65 fell, 
with 51 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="maak">Maa ki hai2</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

ONE man with the courage of his convictions, Chief Justice of Pakistan 
Sajjad Ali Shah, with the support of many of his equally courageous brother 
judges, stood up, straightened and strengthened the pillar he heads. 
   
The doubters followed suit and today we can boast of a judiciary that is 
asserting its independence. Numbers are not the be-all and end-all. The 
evil that surrounds us can be curbed by a few determined men.
    
On the September 20, in this space there appeared a column entitled Maa ki 
hai, about a distressed mother. Its final paragraph read:
    
It would be in the fitness of things if the other Shah of Sindh, Chief 
Justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah, will consider summoning Chief Minister 
Abdullah Shah to stand before him so that he may warn him that should any 
harm or hurt be unjustly caused to either mother or son, Abdullah Shah and 
his cohorts will be held responsible and be duly punished.
    
MQM MPA Wasim Akhtar sent a copy of the column to the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan who nominated a caring judge of the Supreme Court, sitting at 
Karachi, to take suo moto cognisance of the facts as narrated. This was 
done. Hereunder the order of Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid:
    
HR 13 of 1996
    
Complaint of Wasim Akhtar, MPA of Sindh
    
Karachi 8/10/96.
    
A copy of the article published in the daily Dawn of 20/9/96 entitled Maa 
ki hai, inter alia, relating to one Osama Qadri, an accused in custody, 
and his mother Mst Feroza Begum who is alleged to have become a minister of 
the Sindh Cabinet on 11/9/96 was sent to the Chief Justice of Pakistan by 
Wasim Akhtar, MPA Sindh, with the following note:
    
This is for your information. Please read this article and take necessary 
action. This is your duty and responsibility to check on this matter  for 
Gods sake and for Pakistans sake  save this country.
    
This matter was treated as a Human Rights case and notice was issued to 
the learned Advocate-General Sindh and also the petitioner, Wasim Akhtar, 
for today. Mr Abdul Ghafoor Mangi, learned Advocate-General Sindh, has 
appeared pursuant to the notice. Wasim Akhtar, MPA Sindh, is also present. 
He states that he is in custody and 63 criminal cases have been registered 
against him. It is further informed by him that he is confined in his house 
which has been notified as a sub-jail and he has been produced today before 
the Court in custody by the police.
    
2. Mst Feroza Begum is an MPA belonging to MQM (Altaf Group) and, 
according to the article, her son Osama Qadri had been tortured and kept in 
police custody and she had made several complaints to the authorities 
expressing her fear that her son Osama Qadri, who is in police custody 
since 21/8/96, might be killed in a police encounter. According to the 
article in the daily Dawn, she has been forced to become a minister 
disassociating herself from the party to which she belongs and that she has 
done this to save the life of her son Osama Qadri. It is further alleged 
that despite becoming a minister in the Sindh Cabinet, she has not been 
allocated any portfolio and that she is confined in her house and that no 
visitors are allowed to see her.
    
3. If the allegations that are narrated in the said article are correct, 
it would, prima facie, amount to violation of various articles of the 
Constitution, inter alia, the following:
    
a) Article 9 relating to life and liberty of a person.
    
b) Article 10 which provides safeguards against unlawful arrest and 
detention.
    
c) Article 14 which provides that the dignity of man is inviolable.
    
d) Article 15 relating to freedom of movement.
    
e) Article 17 which, inter alia, provides that every citizen shall have the 
right to form, or be a member of, a political party.
    
If Osama Qadri and his mother Mst Feroza Begum have been subjected to 
torture and other illegal treatment as narrated in the said article, the 
persons responsible would also be liable to be proceeded against under the 
relevant provisions of the criminal law.
    
4. The learned Advocate-General submits, on instructions, that various 
allegations referred to in the article are incorrect. He seeks time to file 
statements of the responsible officers of the concerned departments 
supported by documentary evidence to reflect the stand of the Government. 
Mr Wasim Akhtar also states that if he is given some time, he will give 
details of what has happened in so far as Osama Qadri and his mother Mst 
Feroza Begum are concerned.
    
Further proceedings will take place on 16/10/96 at 1.00 p.m. an effort 
should be made that the statements are filed before the next date. On the 
next date, the petitioner Wasim Akhtar should be produced. The learned 
Advocate-General has also been asked to ensure the presence of Mst Feroza 
Begum and her son Osama Qadri on the next date before this court.
    
Nasir Aslim Zahid, J 8/10/96.
    
At this hearing, Sindh Advocate-General Abdul Ghafoor Mangi, on 
instructions, stated that various allegations in the column are incorrect, 
without mentioning exactly what was incorrect. Whose instructions was he 
following?
    
The post of advocate-general is a constitutional post, deliberately non-
political. He cannot function under instructions acting as a mouth-
piece. He is constitutionally obliged to tender independent legal advice 
to the provincial government to the best of his ability. He cannot stand in 
court to defend whatever unconstitutional or illegal actions the government 
of the day decides to embark upon.
    
Chief Minister Abdullah Shah, in an effort to prove his bona fides, invited 
minister without portfolio Feroza Begum, held in protective custody, to 
attend a cabinet meeting on October 15, the first she was invited to attend 
since she was sworn in on September 11. This news was splashed on PTV that 
night.
 
On October 16, as ordered, a sad and frightened widow and her son, Osama 
Qadri in police custody, were produced in court. The AG filed only the 
statement of an SSP, the veracity of which must be doubted as the man has 
direct access to the CM, under whose instructions he acts.
    
Justice Nasir Aslam Zahids order of the 16th records: Mr Adbul Ghafoor 
Mangi, Advocate General Sindh. Petitioner Wasim Akhtar MPA, Sindh. Pursuant 
to the orders passed on 8/10/96 Osama Qadri son of Mst Feroza Begum has 
been produced in custody. Mst Feroza Begum has also appeared and states 
that she had received information from the Home Department that she was 
required to appear in the Court today and accordingly she has appeared.
    
Petitioner Wasim Akhtar has filed a detailed statement along with 
annexures. Copy of the statement with annexures has been supplied to the 
learned Advocate-General. A copy has also been supplied to Mst Feroza 
Begum.
    
Mst Feroza Begum wants to file a detailed statement and for that purpose 
requests for some time. Detenu Osama Qadri states that he is in custody at 
Central Prison, Karachi. He also wants to make a statement and requests 
that on the next date he may be called early so that he may write his 
statement in the Court premises. For the present, Osama Qadri made a 
request that apart from his family members a number of other persons 
unconnected with his family are also allowed by the jail authorities to 
meet him, although he does not want to meet them, and this causes extreme 
harassment and inconvenience to the detenu.
    
The learned Advocate-General has also filed a statement dated 15/10/1996 
of SSP Central, Karachi, Din Muhammad Baloch, supported by a number of 
annexures. Copy of the statement with annexures has been supplied to the 
petitioner as well as to Mst Feroza Begum. In case any party wants to file 
a reply statement, the same may be submitted to the Assistant Registrar of 
this Court by the next date. Further proceedings will now take place at 12 
noon on 24/10/96. To enable detenu Osama Qadri to prepare and file his 
statement he will be produced in custody in this Court by 9.30 a.m. on 
24/10/96. The Assistant Registrar will make arrangements so that the detenu 
can write his statement without disturbance from any quarter.
    
In view of the statement made by the detenu, the Jail Authorities are 
directed not to permit any other person except members of the family of the 
detenu to meet or see him while he is in custody at Central Prison, 
Karachi. This order placing restriction on the Jail Authorities will 
continue until further orders of this Court. The learned Advocate-General 
states that he will communicate this direction to the concerned authorities 
for compliance.
    
The Judges have done what was expected of them. The people must hope that 
Feroza Begum will have the strength to withstand the threats and the 
pressures that will be exerted on her and her son. Bullies, who are 
invariably cowards, must be fought.

<a name="apas">A passion for the truth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

These three years were not easy for us. We had been in minority in the 
Senate. We have had a coalition government in Punjab and at the Centre. It 
required hard work and skills to bring it to three years. I am also 
thankful to my MNAs who co-operated with us in our efforts to give good 
governance and work on our agenda for change. We did de-politicise the 
postings at the CBR, FIA and the Anti-narcotics Force... (we think) 
politics and business are two separate things. 

PM Bhutto in an interview with The News.

IT requires exceptional courage to make such astounding statements. Not the 
faintest allusion here to the trail of slime, decrepitude and corruption 
which, if there is any justice in this world, will be considered as the 
foremost legacy of the Bhutto regime. Ms Bhutto being grateful to her MNAs 
for having co-operated in the effort to give good governance to the 
country. Such audacity robs even the gods of speech.
    
Asked a few moons ago by a CNN interviewer about the charges of corruption 
against her government, PM Bhutto, while setting out a long but implausible 
defence, indignantly responded with the refrain, And corrupt how? I do 
not know about the interviewer but the nation certainly was left speechless 
by the self-righteous fury of that response. And now when the land is in 
turmoil and waiting for things to happen, the PM is claiming credit for 
good governance.
    
Consider also the PMs response to the Presidents latest letter to her 
about political interference in the postings and transfers of 
administrative officials. While thanking the President for his concern, the 
Prime Minister has drawn his attention to various rules which forbid 
bureaucrats from making approaches for their postings or transfers (as if 
the President was unaware of these) and goes on to say: Pakistan Peoples 
Party has been elected on a theme known as Agenda for Change. This is 
also supported by its allies. To implement this Agenda, I have been 
directing my members in the parliamentary party meetings that they should 
desist from meddling in the administrative affairs of CBR, Customs, banks, 
DFIs... This from a prime minister who has overseen the transformation of 
her Secretariat into a super recruiting agency, with the lowliest federal 
jobs being filled on its recommendations (ask Siraj Shamsuddin or Naheed 
Khan how), while banks and DFIs have been reduced to their present straits 
by nominees selected for their pliability rather than their competence.
    
Even at this late hour when a touch of humility or a recognition, however 
remote, of past follies would sit better on this beleaguered government, 
the Prime Minister still chooses to conduct a brass orchestra. Good 
governance indeed. If Ms Bhutto had understood even a bit of what this 
phrase stands for, she would not have been in this predicament, looking 
desperately around to see from where the next blow will come: the 
presidency, the Supreme Court which is hearing the presidential reference 
regarding the power to appoint judges, the Lahore High Court which is 
hearing Manzoor Wattoos petition against his ouster, or the inquiry into 
the killing of Murtaza Bhutto.
    
It is a reflection of the governments plight that Minister for Investment 
(some joke this) Asif Zardari goes off for a few days to London to have his 
eyes examined (according to APP, Pakistani doctors and hospitals, of 
course, not being good enough for him) and the cry goes up that he has fled 
the country. Nothing could be further from the truth if for no other reason 
than that the Minister for Investment, may his camels increase, is made of 
sterner stuff than that. But this wild libel at least gives an indication 
of the popular mood and of the suspicious lenses through which ordinary 
people have begun to view the First Couple. What is the use of all this 
pomp and glory when you cannot even shave off your moustache without giving 
rise to the most alarming theories about your state of mind?
    
It shows something about the way our Republic works, however, that the 
Prime ministers present troubles have arisen not because she is being held 
to account for the corruption of her government but because of the 
egregious tactical errors she has committed: her quarrel with the Supreme 
Court and her taking the President for granted. Which is a bit like saying 
that a transgressor of the law has been caught not because he has broken 
the law but because he happened to annoy the constable on duty. From this 
it follows that if the Prime Minister had shown not the wisdom of Solon 
(hardly required in the circumstances) but merely conducted herself with 
greater care, she would not have been receiving lessons in propriety from 
Sardar Farooq Leghari. Once her subordinate in the iron hierarchy of the 
PPP and later her hand-picked nominee for the presidency, he has been 
transformed suddenly into an implacable school master. For someone whose 
path up the heights has been illumined by arrogance and pride could any 
circumstance be more galling?
    
And yet if the truth were ever to be revealed, Ms Bhuttos tactical errors 
which are proving to be her undoing are nothing when compared with the 
other, more baleful aspects of her rule. Long after her quarrel with Chief 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah is forgotten, the country will still be paying a 
stiff price for her (or is it Shahid Hasan Khans) energy policy? With 
several WAPDA projects in the process of coming on line, it should have 
been clear in 1994 when this energy policy was first put together that the 
shortfall in energy production which the country was facing at the time 
would soon be made up. Yet heedless of this simple calculation, a glut of 
MOUs was signed pledging the country to buy energy at expensive rates (6.5 
cents/KWH) even if it had no use for it. What Pakistan is set to pay 
foreign investors for this surplus energy will be upward of one billion 
dollars in foreign exchange. The tab in local currency will of course be 
picked up by the people of Pakistan, who are already paying through their 
noses for most utilities.
    
But this is just one example of the heedless extravagance that has brought 
the country to its present pass. The Oil and Gas Development Corporation 
was a thriving and paying concern when this government took over. Today it 
is strapped for cash, having been royally milked by its last chairman, my 
friend Riffat Askari. Thank God the President intervened otherwise if Salim 
Saifullah, the Petroleum Minister, had his way, shares in the Qadirpur 
field, one of the most promising in the country, would have gone for a 
song. Will anyone care to investigate matters regarding the construction of 
the Uch gas pipeline in which a Bhutto cousin is set to make a killing?
    
In the current rage over accountability the whole focus is wrong. There is 
no point in holding up the good and the great for accountability when, as 
past experience has amply shown, nothing can be proven against them, the 
good and the great not being in the habit of leaving any traces behind. The 
thing to do when the cows finally come home is to investigate institutions 
like the OGDC and scrutinise individual projects. If a bank has given a bad 
loan, the bank officers concerned should be held to account and then if the 
trail leads anywhere, as in dubious cases it mostly does, it should be 
followed. If there is something wrong with the Uch deal, it should be 
rigorously examined with the hope that if the scrutiny is hard enough it 
will lead to the main players.
    
Deals, commissions, kickbacks: the saga woven around these profitable 
ventures is infinitely richer (if also more amazing) than the tactical 
blunders which have tied the hands of the Bhutto government. The government 
is paying a price for its blunders. Will that day dawn when it is made to 
pay for its other misdeeds? Pakistan has always been robbed. That down the 
years has been its unalterable fate. But robbed on this scale and with such 
zeal. It would take a new Arabian Nights to fully capture the spirit of 
these times.

<a name="thew">The way we compute the crowds</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafizur Rahman

GENERAL elections are nowhere in sight, but, because of the confrontation 
between the ruling regime and the opposition, political parties continue to 
hold public meetings. All of them are doing so: the PPP, the PML(N), the 
Jamaat-i-Islami, and others. 
  
Even Imran Khans Tehreek-i-Insaaf. All of them claim that lakhs of people 
attended each meeting. It would appear that the people of Pakistan had 
nothing better to do.
    
After every meeting the Press too computes the audience; how large it was, 
how many people actually attended. These are all estimates, of course. 
Comparisons are then made, and these comparisons are used to judge the 
popularity of the political party involved.
    
There have been many wrong statistics in Pakistan, but there has been 
nothing more inaccurate than figures of crowds at political rallies. When 
there was a war threat from India in early 1951, and Prime Minister Liaquat 
Ali Khan showed a clenched fist to that country at a truly mammoth public 
meeting in Lahores Minto Park, Meem Sheen, my successor as Dawns 
correspondent in Lahore, put the figure at one million.
    
Many other historic gatherings have been described in similar overblown 
figures since then. In fact, it is a favourite pastime of reporters to make 
such estimates for their newspapers and also discuss them among themselves. 
The general consensus that has developed over the years is that any meeting 
where the crowd is less than a lakh is no meeting at all.
    
The truth is that to be able to collect one lakh persons for a public 
meeting is a most extraordinary feat. It has not been so easy even in a 
country like ours where most people go to political rallies for the fun of 
it, and not because they are seriously interested in the subject or the 
speakers. It is rare that these two  the subject and the speakers  are 
attractive enough to draw enthusiastic crowds.
    
Let me tell you what I have learned about these crowds. It was 1950. The 
place was the University Ground in Lahore, and the speaker was again Mr 
Liaquat Ali Khan. I was on official duty and was seated at a high spot 
overlooking the entire area. During the late Prime Ministers address, for 
want of doing anything more useful, I decided to form a credible idea of 
the gathering.
    
I divided the area mentally and visually into 16 squares, counted every 
head in one square and then multiplied the figure by 16. Then, in order to 
make up for any mistake, I doubled the total, although a ten per cent 
addition would have been enough, and got the final total of eighty 
thousand. The next day the newspapers reliable estimates ranged between 
one and a half lakhs and two lakhs.
    
When exaggerated numbers of attendance at public meetings are disputed, the 
calculators  whether from the Press or the political party concerned  
refer to the now common phenomenon of buses used to bring willing (or even 
unwilling) participants to the venue. Even their calculations are not based 
on common-sense. The biggest bus cannot carry more than a 100 persons. I 
dont think the most enterprising of organisers has ever been able to 
commander a hundred vehicles.
    
I have been to numerous meetings. The buses appear to be countless. They 
are not countless; fifty or sixty at the biggest of rallies. Therefore the 
maximum number that these buses can bring in would be ten thousand. All 
right, fifteen thousand, if you insist. This is only a small proportion of 
the lakhs who are supposed to have attended the meeting.
    
Another thing, and this is of real significance. Demographers say that one 
half of the total population in India and Pakistan is below fifteen years 
of age, whose presence in public meetings is meaningless. For purposes of 
computing audiences at political meetings this formula is very telling. Now 
suppose, for example, we take my friend Meem Sheens figure of ten lakhs at 
Mr Liaquat Ali khans memorable address in Minto Park.
    
The population of Lahore at that time was, at the most, 12 lakh. Subtract 
the demographers figure from this and you have six lakhs left. Subtract 
the female population, whose attendance at such meetings is minimal and can 
be ignored, and you get three lakhs.
    
Even this would mean that if every single male adult in Lahore walked to 
the meeting (no buses were used to bolster that gathering, which was huge 
anyway), and not a single adult soul was left in any house, and the bazaars 
or in hospitals and other such places, and even tottering old men of 70 and 
above did not stay back; in fact if Lahore had become empty except for 
women and children, then the audience in Minto Park was certainly three 
lakhs. But, obviously, all this did not happen, so you can calculate the 
real figure for yourself.
    
Take another instance. Soon after taking over the reins of government in 
December 1971, Mr Z.A. Bhutto addressed a public meeting in Lahores 
Qadhafi Stadium. I was there as part of the organisers. The stadium was 
really jam-packed, with thousands of people outside its walls, just 
listening.
    
It is not difficult to calculate how many people a stadium can seat on the 
steps and on the central green. The real expert figure, packing the men 
like the proverbial sardines, was under a lakh and a half. And yet, the 
next days newspaper accounts vied with one another in the number of lakhs 
they could muster.
    
The same realistic standard of computation (the demographers) should hold 
true for other gatherings like processions and funerals. Wherever you hear 
the word lakhs mentioned in regard to crowds and audiences, apply the 
formula, then subtract the women, make provision for the fact that life 
went on normally in the crowded bazaars, and then see what you get. But I 
suppose those interested in exaggerated figures dont want to do that. It 
is not a particularly nice feeling when you have to face stark facts.
    
To which, of course, statisticians and publicists of the political parties 
will retort: even if there is merit in what you say, and even if there were 
only fifty thousand persons at our public meeting and not three lakhs 
claimed by us, so what? Ours is still the most popular political party in 
the country, and you can put that in your pipe and smoke it!

<a name="deva">Devaluation, what devaluation?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD: Makhdoom Shahabuddin has never been known for his financial 
acumen but his string of past performances paled before what he did on 
Tuesday. It had to be seen to be believed when at around noon the minister 
of state for finance sheepishly admitted his ignorance of the early morning 
devaluation of the national currency.
    
On top of it all, he even tried the Senate into believing that he had known 
about the 8.4 per cent devaluation but his belated attempt was brought to a 
naught by an unsparing Wasim Sajjad.
    
It all began during a discussion emanating from a question posed by Anwer 
Bhinder regarding the inflation rate and the minister, confidently painting 
a picture of economic bliss, little knowing that moments later his own 
bliss would stand transformed into an embarrassment. It would have been 
okay had he confined himself to talking of an inflation figure of 9.9 per 
cent, which is placed at over 20 per cent by independent observers, but 
probably he got carried away by his own heavily accented English and 
promised to bring down inflation, as well as budgetary deficit and 
unemployment, and he would have gone on had he not been cut dead in his 
tracks by a sarcastic sounding Wasim Sajjad.
    
Sure, Mr Sajjad interjected, inflation will definitely be brought down 
by the latest devaluation. That should have been the end of the matter but 
the chairman could see from the baffled expression on the ministers face 
that he did not have a clue about devaluation.
    
And then the barbed jabs started flowing in. Looking straight at the 
minister, Wasim Sajjad asked: Are you aware of the devaluation? A 
flustered Makhdoom tried bluffing his way out by evasively replying: Aisa 
to hota Rehta Hai(such things keep happening). In that instant Wasim 
Sajjad knew he had scored a direct hit and zeroed in once again: Im 
asking you to tell me that do you know that there has been a big 
devaluation of the rupee because that is my information and it could be 
incorrect. The commerce minister tried bailing out his colleague by 
whispering the information to him but by that time Makhdoom Shahabuddin 
appeared beyond reach as he mumbled his ignorance of the whole affair.
    
He tried salvaging his smothered pride by rambling something about the 
decision being the domain of the governor of the State Bank only to be 
further embarrassed by Wasim Sajjad who feigned his shock at discovering 
that the governor of the SBP had not even bothered discussing such an 
important matter with him. And there was more to come.
    
A few more speakers and myriad innuendoes later, Anwar Bhinder asked for a 
categorical assurance by the minister that no further devaluations would 
take place. Once again Wasim Sajjad chimed in by sarcastically observing: 
Why are you insisting with him because he doesnt even know of todays 
devaluation. An equally stinging remark came from Fazle Agha who shouted: 
No wonder we are in such a shape because the government had sent this man 
to negotiate with the IMF who has no idea of what is going on and doesnt 
even know his own budget figures. A reference to another shiny bloomer of 
the day.
    
It so happened that while replying to another question the minister 
confidently asserted that the government had been allowed an internal 
borrowing limit of Rs30 billion in the budget, whereas the budget figure 
stood at Rs 20 billion. He even insisted on debating the technicalities of 
the matter at hand. In the end all that the minister could say in his 
ultimate defence was that he qualified for the job because he had majored 
in economics.
    
Sen Khalil raised an issue that was not even remotely funny. The senator 
appeared distraught by what he perceived to be a gross violation of the 
Constitution  the non- holding of any meeting of the Council of Common 
Interests (CCI) during the last three years. Sen Khalil, commonly known as 
Commander, is considered very close to the most important factor in 
national politics and, therefore, the significance of his question was not 
lost on the house.
    
Mustafa Khar tried countering by admitting the lapse and argued that the 
Constitution did not stipulate any period and assured the House that the 
government still had two years to go and the meetings would surely take 
place. Not so, retorted Aftab Sheikh who said that by the rules set by the 
CCI an yearly meeting was mandatory. Quite a few senators spoke on the 
subject but none pointed out that the chargesheets against the dismissed 
governments of both Benazir and Nawaz Sharif had one thing in common and 
that was the charge of their having failed to convene the meetings of CCI 
as warranted by the Constitution.

<a name="prop">Proper place, priority for sports wanting</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Alauddin Ghauri

The importance of sports in a nations life has to be understood and 
appreciated to put the institutions on the right keel to bring about a 
positive upward change in these institutions; educational institutions must 
also be actively involved. Importance of sports should be second to 
education. Educational institutions are the reservoir of unexplored raw 
materials, lying in earth for want of a systematic programme for 
development of sports and games. There is no dearth of talent and resources 
in the educational institutions which can only be exploited through 
dedication and honesty of purpose. These institutions being under the 
government can be ordered to follow a set system and programme which was 
implemented for a decade or so after the independence.
    
The PSB which came into being through an ordinance in 1962, was part of the 
Ministry of Education. This clearly suggests that realising the importance 
and role sports play in a nations life, it was grouped with education. 
However, an ill-advised surgery was carried out to separate the twins and 
place sports under Culture and Tourism which continues to create 
complications. Sports have not received the desired attention from the 
Ministry as the front seats are occupied by culture and tourism; sports 
regrettably are treated as recreation. Things are likely to continue as 
they are unless sports is recognised as a distinct discipline and given the 
importance it deserves.
    
Separation of sports from education, despite availability of grade 14-20 
PTIs/DPEs in schools and colleges, has resulted in lack of interest, 
activities and decline in standards. Educational institutions have adequate 
resources as a reasonable amount is charged from a student at the time of 
admission; private students are even made to pay the sports subscription 
but are ineligible to represent their institutions. Universities and 
colleges present a dismal picture in so far as facilities are concerned 
despite collection of millions. Lack of interest can easily be judged from 
the number of teams that participates in inter-varsity, inter-collegiate 
and inter-school tournaments.
    
Sports activities instead of following a set schedule and calendar as in 
the case of examinations, continue throughout the year and for this reason 
most of the students cannot gave due attention to sports. Teams are raised 
and competitions held without defining the aim and objectives. A talented 
athlete should be near his peak when he enters a university. However, wrong 
planning, rather no planning by the UGC has done enormous damage to sports. 
UGC should be concentrating more on the improvement of standards and 
provisioning of facilities than on seeking affiliation with the national 
federations/POA where politics rules supreme.
    
Federal Minister would do great service to sports if he gives a serious 
thought to placing sports under the education so that desired attention is 
given in schools, colleges and universities.
   
Alternatively, if resources permit (unlikely under the existing 
conditions), an independent ministry should be created. UGC would be in a 
better position to devote its energies towards the betterment of sports if 
it is forced to withdraw from the national federations/POA. In order to 
assess the progress shown by various educational institutions, games on the 
pattern of national games of a limited number of events be held annually by 
UGC, Secondary Board and Schools Board.
    
Results produced by institutions would act as a barometer to gauge the 
performance and efficiency of sports incharge. Development of sports 
facilities in schools, colleges and universities, occupies a fundamental 
place in the creation of talent capable of earning recognition in games and 
sports events at home and abroad.
   
We should introduce athletics, hockey, football, basket ball, boxing, table 
tennis and badminton as compulsory subjects and should systematically and 
faithfully implement it. Institutions with limited resources should be 
asked to concentrate on optional games.
    
We are convinced that the sports horizon would brighten up and things would 
appear encouraging if the concerned authorities manage to force the 
educational institutions to faithfully implement the policy. This would 
result in maximum exploitation of un-explored talent available in sports 
reservoirs.

<a name="hock">Hockey change-over and the problems to be tackled</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

A change of guards at the top level the hockey organisation, though 
expected for sometime, should set at rest the speculations and conjectures 
afloat in the country, especially because there was a leadership gap in 
what is generally regarded as the national game.
    
One expected Mr Nawaz Tiwana to take over the onerous responsibilities of 
head of the hockey federation after having staged a comeback as managing 
director of the national carrier in April this year. This would have been 
the traditional arrangement  a continuation of the system since the days 
of the hockey think-tank and supremo, Air Marshal Nur Khan. But due to 
pressures other than his airlines workload he kept aloof from the hockey 
affairs. Officially and rather surprisingly it was let known that Air Vice 
Marshal (Retd) Farooq Umar, his predecessor in PIA, has not to vacate the 
PHF charges due to the approaching Atlanta Olympics and the supervisory 
role being played by him for the preparations of a robust outfit. A new 
incumbent will have to modify the paper-work and the plans being enforced 
may be topsy-turvied. The AVMs tenure was thus extended for some months at 
a Council meeting specially convoked to formalise the arrangement.
    
There was unanimity at the latest Council decision and relief at the 
departure from the hockey scene of AVM Farooq Umar who was at the helm of 
PHF for about three-and-a -half years, having been re-elected for unknown 
reasons on Dee 23, 1994. The organisations Secretary, Col Mudassar Asghar, 
described the regularisation of the presidents post in the larger 
interest of hockey and expressed the hope that things would now move in 
the right direction. Hockey circles also feel that the slump in the level 
of the game may be arrested and misdemeanours may not raise their ugly 
heads under Nawaz Tiwana, combining the qualities of leadership, courage 
and vision.
    
It is a moot point if the AVM made ample contribution to the progression of 
the countrys hockey or he was more responsible for the injection of 
politics in the game, which ultimately led to the opening of a revolving 
door for an agonising result at the Olympics. He chalked out the 
methodology for throwing down the gauntlet to the countries belonging to 
the higher echelon of global hockey, a job which strictly belonged to the 
technocrats of the game, interfered in the selection of a cohesive set, an 
assignment reserved for the former Olympians; the federation chief is named 
to chair the panel only by virtue of his office. The start of the AVMs 
term in the middle of 1993 was rather patchy. While the combination dropped 
to a fourth placement in the Kuala Lumpur Championship Trophy the outfit 
had the stunning shock at Hiroshima where South Korea, showing considerable 
thrust and flair, exposed chinks in the armour of the Pakistan side in the 
Asia Cup, an honour in its possession since the inception of the regional 
contest in 1982.
    
However, soon the country recovered its ground and struck the purple patch 
by brushing aside the challenge of all-comers and lifting the Champions 
Trophy, the toughest competition in the hockey calendar, limited to six top 
global nations, after a gap of 14 years. No doubt the triumph was due to 
the glamour outfit, cheered and backed up by the home crowd, but credit has 
to be given to the AVM who lent the motivation and direction to the side at 
the headquarters of the countrys hockey.
    
This emphatic and convincing victory and the games supremacy among the 
elitist group was followed by a few hiccups, especially at Penang in the 
Azlan Shah invitational contest, where Pakistan lost a trial of strength in 
penalty shoot-out. There was a further slump in the hockey fortunes as 
South Korea repeated its earlier success in the Asia Cup by outstroking 
Pakistan in the Asian Games. Diffidence more than zest characterised the 
approach work of the squad. This was in October, 1994. But after this 
shocking slip from grace and trauma at Hiroshima, considerable soul-
searching took place at home, and with extremes of effort and drill at the 
camp the team at the Sydney World Cup two months later had the match-
winning prowess and resilience. Adventure took the place of lethargy; 
hesitancy gave way to pace and speed. Hockey heavyweights were humbled and 
Pakistan again scaled the Himalayan heights to come out as world champions. 
Both Germany and Holland were edged out, the latter in the final. Such is 
the unfathomable mystery of the unexpected in sport. The national squad 
were the rightful winners, AVM Farooq got the cheers and accolade that were 
his.
    
However, the World Cup was the last major success during the tenure of AVM. 
At the Berlin Champions Trophy in September 1995, the 17 edition of the 
competition, Pakistan could not go beyond a third place. In the SAF Games 
at Madras in what was the debut of hockey the country suffered disaster. 
The team was trained by the hockey chief himself. The selectors, the 
majority belonging to PIA, could not utter a word against the list of the 
AVM. Pakistan was pulverised by India by a whopping margin of 5-2 in the 
final. Dhanraj Pillay and Mukesh Kumar showed the true Asian style and time 
and again cut through the defences of Pakistan. Shahbaz, the individualist, 
was slow and appeared out of rhythm. He could not make any headway through 
over-elaboration. The squad returned totally battered and bruised.
    
Further trouble was in store for during the preparatory period for the 
Olympics a good number of players staged a revolt and discipline was sent 
to the winds. The AVM, who was blamed for encouraging an out-of-form 
Shahbaz, was found to be weak against the players and both the manager, 
Mudassar Asghar and coach Manzoorul Hasan had to bow to the players power. 
Shahbaz was initially axed from the Olympic side but due to pressure of the 
AVM and non-technicians in a Senate panel he was rushed to Atlanta at the 
eleventh hour. The combination was disturbed for the shuffling in the 
playing set impaired its co-ordination and understanding. At the lemon time 
AVM Farooq was taking over the role of a manger and was going to the field 
for instruction and technical advice (as was seen on TV).
    
Pakistan was relegated to an eighth spot in the Olympics, the worst-ever 
result in the history of the country, the decline was three places down the 
Seoul Olympics of 1988 where Pakistan finished fifth. The disgrace at the 
Olympics stunned and shocked the fans of the game. The AVM had but to make 
a second bow.
    
Taking his tenure as a whole it was a mixed one with the Champions Trophy 
and World Cup victories touching the high mark but the closing period was a 
perilous one, full of behind-the-scenes politics that resulted in a ruinous 
record at the Olympics.
    
Hockey enthusiasts cannot but welcome the change in the hierarchy of the 
federation. Nawaz, who will be having a second term as PHF President, 
having earlier held the office from April 1991 to May 1993, has a difficult 
job on hand. Not only the manager and the coach for the senior string have 
to be nominated and confirmed but preparations in right earnest are to 
start for the Champions Trophy, due to be held in Madras in December, and 
Pakistan has to try its luck at the SAF Games in Kathmandu. Can Pakistan 
endure the hockey setbacks of the earlier part of the year and regain its 
lost place in international and regional hockey. It is a Herculean task for 
the new PHF head.
    
Besides, there are talks of the ouster of Col Mudassar Asghar, the 
Secretary, whom Tiwana during his first tenure had brought in. Can 
Mudassar, who had been a part of the hockey mess created by Farooq Umar, 
continue to enjoy the confidence of Tiwana, the Council, most of whose 
members are dissatisfied with the Secretarys role.
    
Tiwana has also to come out with hockey tour plans to assess the strength 
and weakness of both the junior and senior strings. More contests have to 
be launched at home at the grass-root and club levels, the base of any 
countrys hockey.
    
Discipline has to be maintained and no undue demands of the players have to 
be accepted. Hockey lovers want the new president to be a tough planner 
with healthy ideas. Then only can the game and the team take the right road 
to progress and success.

<a name="tenn">Tennis: responsibility of PTF and affiliated units</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

Pakistans showing on the tennis front continues to be a woefully poor and 
its chances of getting a place in Group One of the 1997 Davis Cup Asia-
Oceania Zone appear beak. In fact we are struggling to avoid relegation 
from Group Two to Three.
    
According to the draws announced last week by the International Tennis 
Federation, the Asia-Oceania Zone Group two first round matches start on 
Feb 7. Pakistan will take on Iran in a three-day match from Feb 7-9. The 
venue has yet to be settled. It may be either Pakistan or Iran, depending 
on the decision of ITF.
    
For a couple of years Pakistans overall standard has gone down 
considerably and the officials concerned, as usual, pass the buck since 
there is no proper accountability at any stage of jurisdiction.
    
When the new set-up of the Pakistan Tennis Federation took over a year 
ago, great hopes were entertained for the uplift of the game on a 
scientific line. As a matter of fact, the PTF, headed by Federal Minister 
for Petroleum and Natural Resources Anwar Saifullah, started on a promising 
note. No doubt he did ensure the holding of the ITF Satellite circuit last 
year in which international players competed, but the arrangements made in 
Karachi for holding two of the four legs were marred by adverse reports 
front the ITF tournament referee.
    
The 1996 tennis calendar is nearing an end and this time official 
statements for not holding the satellite this year, which would have been 
beneficial for our leading stars as well as for our up-and-coming tennis 
players are unconvincing. Thus the chance will be missed to play against 
and match world class players will be missed. The circuit helps the players 
to get ITF points too an also in assessing the competitive standard of our 
own players.
    
Coming to the domestic tennis it is a sad commentary that for well over 
eight years no national clay court championship was staged in Rawalpindi.
    
The national clay court championship was one of the three major events of 
Pakistans annual tennis calendar. The other two major events are the 
national grass court organised by the Punjab Tennis Association and the 
national hard court staged by the Singh Tennis Association. The Rawalpindi-
Islamabad Tennis Association used to hold the national clay court 
championship at the Rawalpindi Club, which event has virtually gone out of 
the annual calendar. The irony is that the PTF did not much bother for the 
revival of national clay court event otherwise the championship could have 
been revived.
    
The Islamabad Tennis Association holds the Federation Cup at the Islamabad 
Clubs clay courts but the PTF did not use its influence to ensure the 
revival of the clay court championship. Rather it remained a silent 
spectator. Alternate avenues were not tapped either.
    
Even the National Hard Court Championship could not be staged for the past 
two years. For this lapse the Sindh Tennis Association is responsible which 
is an affiliated unit of the PTF. The failure to stage this once regularly-
staged and organised event, seems a sad reflection on the provincial 
association, which under the constitution, is responsible for the games 
development in Sindh.
    
It is also disappointing that only three all-Pakistan tournaments could be 
staged in nine months of the current year beginning with the ICI Open in 
January in Karachi, the all Pakistan tournament in Rahimyar Khan and Khyber 
Cup on an all-Pakistan basis in Peshawar.
    
The recently-concluded Sirajul Haq Invitational Memorial tournament at 
Islamabad was not a ranking contest.
    
Three ranking tournaments in nine months and only two in upcountry show the 
ineffectiveness of the federation to impress upon all its affiliated units 
to hold the ranking events properly and regularly to help the players 
assess their strength and hone their shots.
    
Now the domestic tennis is back in Karachi and this month the Sindh 
Governors Cup was the fourth ranking event, followed by the KMC Cup 
Ranking Tournament. The other new event - the Chase Open ranking 
championship is scheduled to start from Oct 19 at the Karachi Club.
    
There may be two or three more tournaments by the end of the year but they 
are considered totally inadequate to promote tennis in the country as there 
is no significant tennis competitions at the divisional levels in Punjab, 
Sindh, NWFP and Balochistan. The less said about other affiliated units of 
the federation the better.
  
The provincial associations lend no help financially to the young stars who 
go abroad for the ITF juniors event. The parents spend money on their sons 
and daughters for the away tours. It is a different matter that the PTF 
bears the tour expenses when it sends its team to the ITF youth 
competition. Let the PTF and its affiliated units play a positive role in 
the uplift of the game in the country before it is too late.

KARACHI, Oct 20: Air Chief Marshal Mohammad Abbas Khattak, Chief of the Air 
Staff and President of Pakistan Squash Federation, recalling the 
organisational success of the 1993 World Open and Team Championship, today 
expressed his total and complete confidence in PSF expertise in efficiently 
staging next months PSO World Open, the richest championship of US dollars 
1,30,000, here at the DHA Squash Complex.
    
The 20th World Open squash, first hosted in 1984 in Karachi by the Sindh 
Squash Association with Aslam Sanjrani as its secretary, is to be staged 
for the third time from Nov 17 in the city. The 1993 championship was 
organised by the PSF .
    
Addressing a joint press conference after the conclusion of the sponsorship 
agreement ceremony here this afternoon at the PAF War College, Air Chief 
Marshal Khattak, thanked the sponsors , specially the title sponsors 
Pakistan State Oil for the financial support it wishes to extend in bailing 
us out when one of the sponsors withdrew at the eleventh hour of the 1993 
Championships when both the World Open and the Team Championship, together 
for the first time, was staged in the city.
    
Since then they are they are extending their financial support to the 
national squash and they are the major sponsors of the 20th World Open, the 
federation chief stated. The PSO has signed an agreement of Rs five million 
for the world Open, a super series event of the world squash calendar, said 
Air Chief Marshal Khattak who briefly addressed the mediamen while Air 
Marshal Aliuddin, Senior vice-president of the federation, and Hasan Musa, 
recently elected as vice-president of the World Squash Federation and who 
is the Tournament Director of the World Open, answered the questions of the 
Pressmen.
    
Air Marshal Aliuddin informed the mediamen that all the worlds leading 
players and Pakistan champion of the world Jansher Khan, have entered the 
championship to be staged in a grand fashion. There is tremendous response 
from the foreign players to play in the World Open here and this shows our 
traditional hospitalities they cherish when they return home said Air 
Marshal Aliuddin.
    
The prize money of the 1993 World Open, was US dollars one lakh and this 
time it is US dollars one lakh and thirty thousands as PSOs highest bid 
was accepted by the PSA.

<a name="hasa">Hasan Raza may make Test debut</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

FAISALABAD, Oct 24: Hasan Raza goes into history books on Thursday as the 
youngest player ever to appear in a Test match when Zimbabwe and Pakistan 
battle out for the series in the final game of the two-match rubber at the 
Iqbal Stadium. The first Test at Sheikhupura ended in a draw.
    
When schoolboy Hasan Raza will be officially named in the playing side on 
the opening day on Thursday, he will be 14 years and 228 days and would, 
thus, break the 38-year-old record of Mushtaq Mohammad. Mushtaq, who will 
see his record go out as Pakistan team manager, was 15 years and 124 days 
when he made his debut against the mighty West Indies at Lahore in the 
1958-59 series. "The boy (Hasan Raza) is fantastic," Mushtaq said after 
supervising the training session on Wednesday morning.
    
Skipper Wasim Akram also looked after his fielding session and watched 
Hasan Raza bat at the nets from the non-striker's end. Akram was later seen 
passing on some valuable tips to the teenager after he had completed his 
workouts at No 4 position. "Raza has impressed me. I haven't seen him 
before but I am impressed with the way he has batted," commented Akram 
after the conclusion of the training session. "He seems to be confident and 
a perfect batsman."
    
Hasan Raza, born on March 3, 1982 in Karachi, was extremely modest. "I 
don't know yet if I am playing. But if given chance, I will try to put up 
my best show to justify my selection." Hasan Raza, a Matric student of the 
Boys Secondary School, FC Area, earned the vote of the selectors after he 
scored four centuries in the National Juniors Cup. 
    
Though immensely talented, Hasan Raza is extremely raw at top grade 
cricket. For him it will be a tough task to come to terms at such a young 
age and give a good account of himself. His Test debut will not only be a 
test of skills and potential but also of his nerves.
