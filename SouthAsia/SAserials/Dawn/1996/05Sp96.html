<a name="paki">Pakistan, India trade heavy fire at Siachen</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtashamul Haque

SIACHEN GLACIERS, Sept 2: There has been a heavy exchange of fire between 
Indian and Pakistani troops at Siachen during the last few days, including 
a number of air violations by New Delhi in the area.
    
India has become so desperate due to Pakistans stand on Kashmir and 
world-wide condemnation of gross human rights violations in Valley that 
they have resorted to unprovoked firing at Siachen.
    
But we are here to protect every inch of our motherland at this highest 
battleground in the world and tactically or otherwise we are better placed 
here compared to Indian troops, said a senior military official.
    
Briefing reporters at an altitude of about 13,000 feet on Siachen  Gyari 
and Densome, he confirmed that an Indian aircraft had violated Pakistans 
air space last week.
    
He agreed with a correspondent that the issue of Siachen was linked to 
Kashmir and that India wanted Pakistan to give up its stand on the issue. 
But we are not careless and I can tell you proudly that Indian troops have 
always suffered more casualties than Pakistan.
    
However, he said that non-battle casualties on both sides were more because 
of extreme cold weather ranging from 30 to 50 degrees below freezing point. 

The official agreed that there was no tactical value of the area and said 
Pakistan was confronting an aggression and trying to prevent new 
aggressions.
    
Responding to a question he said that battle at Siachen was costing heavily 
both in terms of men and material and the fighting there did not pay any 
dividend to any side.
    
Major casualties occur due to intense cold weather which causes frostbite. 
Diseases like pulmonary oedema, cerebral oedema, snow blindness, kidney 
complications and mountain sickness are common. 

According to the official, Indias one-day expenditure stands at around 
Rs50 million, while Pakistans expenditures are much lower.
    
India uses helicopters for every work while we use them rarely and get our 
jobs done through other means.
    
A single dress of a soldier costs the government about Rs45,000 which 
becomes useless after 6 months. It is imported from Britain.

<a name="kash">Kashmir retained on UN Council agenda till 1998</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 29: The United Nations Security Council on Thursday 
formally amended its July 30 decision, wherein it dropped 50 items, 
including, Kashmir and Palestine, from its agenda of matters it is seized 
of.
    
But as a compromise reached on Tuesday by a consensus it decided to include 
all items which member states wish to retain on the list by notifying it 
before September 15, 1996. That means items including Kashmir will be 
restored to the agenda until January, 1998.
    
The Council also decided that the secretary general would issue an annual 
summary statement each year and all those items will remain in the list if 
a member state notifies the secretary general.
    
However, it rejected demands by Pakistan, Arab and other member states to 
do away with the procedure completely. The procedure, the Council members 
say is essential for reforming and overhauling the United Nations Security 
Councils agenda and cut peacekeeping costs.

<a name="newe">New equipment will keep F-16s in order: Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 31: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said on Saturday the 
release of the embargoed US arms under the Brown Amendment was Pakistans 
victory and a closing of a difficult phase of relationship between 
Islamabad and Washington.
    
The completion of this (shipment) process would mark the closing of a 
difficult phase of our relationship with the United States and the 
beginning of a new phase in our bilateral co-operation, Benazir Bhutto 
told reporters at Chaklala Air Base where a PAF Boeing aircraft brought the 
second consignment of arms from the United States.
    
Bhutto said the release of embargoed arms had been achieved by adherence to 
a principled stand, backed by well thought out diplomatic efforts and 
considerable hard work.
    
The second shipment worth $50 million consists of F-16 spare parts and 
modification kits.

Bhutto said India had created obstacles to stop the United States from 
releasing these arms and equipment and even bribed the United States 
officials for this purpose.

<a name="pmac">PM accuses India of training MQM men</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Sept 1: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said the political 
process in Pakistan will resolve the Mohajir Qaumi Movement problem in 
Karachi, but for India, which she accused of training MQM activists and 
transforming them into terrorists.
    
Writing in the Harvard International Review on the politics of identity in 
South Asia  transcending divisions  the consolidation of Pakistan, Ms 
Bhutto observes: South Asia will have a bleak future if such cross-border 
interference, masterminded by overgrown intelligence services, continues. 
The political process will resolve MQM problems in Karachi, and Indian 
interference will result only in injecting avoidable tension into inter-
state relations.
    
Accusing India of hegemonic ambitions in the South Asian region, Ms Bhutto 
says: ... not a single state in South Asia has escaped gross interference 
in its internal affairs. Even the smallest of states which pose no 
conceivable threat to their great neighbour, have seen this interference 
plunge them into long periods of internal turmoil.

OFFERS PEACE: Saying that Pakistan would like to open an entirely new 
chapter of co-operative relations with India, Ms Bhutto called upon the 
Indian leaders to negotiate a peaceful solution to the Kashmir problem as 
well as reciprocally binding non-proliferation regime for nuclear weapons 
and delivery systems.

She said as the two largest states of the subcontinent, India and Pakistan, 
owe it to South Asia to transform its only regional organisation, the South 
Asian Association for Regional Co-operation, into a more meaningful and 
effective vehicle of regional economic and social development.
    
Ms Bhutto said most of the instability faced by Pakistan comes not from 
the domestic separatism but from external interference and threats.

<a name="newc">New City housing project hits snags</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Aug 31 : The multi-billion housing project, New City: Islamabad, 
has run into snags as the land owners in the area are demanding the price 
which the developers are not willing to pay.
    
This private-public joint venture was scheduled to be launched in March, 
1996 but due to the failure of the sponsors to arrange the targeted 80,000 
Kanals, the project has suffered extended delays.
    
A visit to the villages which are supposed to fall in the New City revealed 
a story totally different from what the developers have been telling people 
in the well furnished offices in Islamabad.
    
Agents of the MG Holdings, the key company which is developing the New City 
are finding it extremely difficult to buy land as the villagers are 
demanding exorbitant prices. So far the sponsors have succeeded in 
purchasing some non-agricultural lands in deh shamlat (collective 
ownership) lands and some other tracts. But villagers having land with 
agricultural potential have so far resisted the attempts of the agents of 
the New City sponsors, quoting prices which render the whole project 
uneconomic.

At the time the project was made public through press reports, the rate of 
land in the area varied between Rs20,000 to Rs 40,000 per Kanal.
    
Pakistan Navy which is developing a housing scheme, Anchorage Sihala, for 
its officers, had purchased over 2600 Kanals in the area at the average 
price of Rs40,000 per Kanal.
    
Similarly, Overseas Pakistani Foundation (OPF) had purchased about 800 
Kanals in Mouza Ladhiot at a rate little higher than the one paid by the 
Navy.
    
But no sooner had the developers of the New City announced that they would 
be selling one Kanal of land in the proposed city at Rs6,50,000, the owners 
in these villages began demanding a minimum of Rs100,000 per Kanal for 
their land.
    
Mohammed Tahir, a member of lumberdar family of Ladihot, told Dawn that 
people were selling only shamlat land in the area. He said his family owned 
over 2100 Kanals of malkiat (individually owned) land in Mouza Ladhihot.
    
He said that not a single Kanal of malkiat land had been purchased for the 
New City project from his village, Ladihot. Tahir further said that 
according to his information the developers have purchased only a rocky 
hillock near Bhimber Tarar. He said people were not willing to sell their 
land at the price which the developers were offering.
    
People in the area are totally confused. We read in the newspapers that 
people are purchasing plots in the proposed New City but we know that the 
developers have no plots to sell because we have not sold them any plot, 
he added.
    
He said that when the project was announced in late 1995, a number of 
property dealers began visiting the target villages looking for a bonanza, 
but as soon as they learnt the owners too were awaiting for a bonanza and 
were not willing to sell their lands even at the prices that the Navy and 
the Overseas Foundation had paid for their schemes, they began 
disappearing.

The project needs at least 20,000 Kanals of continuous tract to start with. 
But the 20,000 Kanals the sponsors have purchased so far are in small 
pieces and these pieces are mortgaged with the CDA.

<a name="drug">Drug prices raised by over 32pc</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, Sept 3: Pharmaceutical companies have come out with new price 
lists showing an average increase of over 32 per cent including five per 
cent general sales tax in the prices of five controlled items.
    
The increase which has come into effect from Sept 1 was made in accordance 
with a health ministrys directive, issued in the end of July, asking the 
pharmaceutical concerns that price adjustment in both controlled and 
decontrolled categories shall be made from Sept 1, 1996.
    
A severe shortage of a number of both controlled and decontrolled items 
exists, leading to black marketing.
    
Like last month, the new lists also include the five per cent general sales 
tax levied on all types of drugs  antibiotics, vitamins, cough syrups and 
iron or dietary supplements.
    
A new list released by a pharmaceutical company through its distributors 
show that prices of at least five controlled drugs have gone up.
    
The receipt vouchers issued to retailers showed new rates along with a 
separate entry of sales tax, but the packing of medicines has no price 
mark, nor the old ones, leaving it up to the retailer to write new rates as 
he wished.
    
For example, Aria tablets, which was previously available for Rs 53.25 (30-
tablet pack) are now being quoted for Rs 69.22 along with a Rs 2.68 sales 
tax. Blokium tablets of 100 mg (15 tablets) and 50 mg (30 tablets), 
previously available for Rs 68.69 and Rs 73.27, now cost Rs 100 and Rs 120 
along with a Rs 3.87 and Rs 4.64 sales tax, respectively.

<a name="bena">Benazir rejects consensus govt idea</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 4: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Wednesday rejected the 
idea of a consensus government run by technocrats and unelected people and 
sought oppositions co-operation to strengthen the system and recover Rs95 
billion stuck-up loans.
    
There is no question of accepting the proposal for a consensus government 
only because some vested interests desire so. We simply reject the theories 
of consensus coming from the adventurers and fortune seekers, she 
maintained.
    
Speaking in the National Assembly after the conclusion of a two-hour debate 
on loan default issue, the prime minister opposed the idea of a caretaker 
government or of any new arrangement not based on democracy but autocracy 
and authoritarian rule.
    
This is a wishful thinking of some people to grab power but I want to tell 
the adventurers that I am here as a result of election and nobody can 
snatch this right from me, she stated.

During the debate both sides accused each other of receiving loans from 
banks. The mover of the adjournment motion Mehmood Khan Achakzi in his 
speech had demanded of the prime minister, in her presence, to give up 
politics and go home. We should get rid of both Ms Bhutto and Nawaz 
Sharif, he said.

<a name="imra">Imran gives govt choice on cancer hospital
</a>-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Sept 4: Tehrik-i-Insaaf convenor Imran Khan on Wednesday urged the 
government either to allow him to raise funds from educational institutions 
for his cancer hospital or meet the needs of the hospital by extending it 
financial assistance.

Addressing a news conference at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust Hospital, 
he said Rs 161 million had already been spent on the treatment of the 
cancer patients.

A total of 12,805 registered cancer patients paid 41,541 visits to the SKMT 
Hospital. No fees were charged for 40,927 visits.

Imran Khan regretted that the Punjab government had not paid even a single 
penny to compensate the Rs 30 million loss caused to the hospital because 
of the April 14 bomb blast. He said the few patients transferred to the 
Jinnah Hospital for treatment because of the blast had returned to the SKMT 
Hospital within a few days.

Now, he said, cancer patients were having to wait for an appointment 
because some outdoor patients had to be shifted to wards meant for indoor 
patients.

If the government gave financial assistance to the hospital or allowed it 
to raise funds from the educational institutions, Imran Khan said, the 
delay could be shortened.

He alleged that the government had not only created difficulties for the 
hospital but had also deprived it of the loans it was getting from some 
foreign countries.

<a name="blas">Blast rips through power plant, two killed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 3: At least two KESC engineers were killed and three other 
employees were injured in an explosion which knocked out the 66mw Unit-2 of 
the Korangi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) shortly after midday on Tuesday, 
officials said. The KESC officials said all three were out of danger.
    
Besides the loss of lives, extensive damage was caused by the explosion 
which forced the authorities to shut down the remaining three units of the 
plant.

The blast immediately caused a shortage of 50mw but the crunch was felt 
during the evening peak hours.
    
The KTPS had two units of 66mw and two of 125mw capacity and all of them 
were operating much below their designated capacity, the KESC officials 
said. The unit which caught fire was commissioned in 1965 and had completed 
its 30-year-life span.
    
At noon the operational staff noticed sparks in the units exciter, perhaps 
owing to unmanageable excessive power being generated at that time. Sensing 
the danger, they started closing down the unit but before they finished 
doing so, the Unit-2 exploded at 12:20 pm, ripping off the operations 
control room and causing extensive damage to heavy equipment of the plant.

The PAF fire-fighting personnel were the first to reach the scene and 
succeeded in extinguishing the fire after two hours.
    
At the time of the explosion the plant was generating 220mw power out of 
which the damaged unit was producing 35mw or about half of its installed 
capacity.
    
The closure of three other units compelled the KESC to resort to 
loadshedding to the tune of 50mw during day time.

A KESC spokesman, however, said the company would not be resorting to 
loadshedding during the evening peak hours because WAPDA had promised to 
provide up to 400mw, if required by the KESC.

<a name="hous">Household expenses exceed incomes</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report
    
ISLAMABAD, Sept 3: The monthly expenditure of 82.88 % households in 
Pakistan exceeded their incomes during 1992-93, according to the Household 
Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) released by Federal Bureau of Statistics 
Tuesday.
    
The biggest income-expenditure gap  Rs 837  was suffered by households 
with the income level of Rs 935 who represented 5.68 % of total households. 
The highest income group saddled with the deficit were households receiving 
a monthly income of Rs 4360. And these are 9.36% of the total.
    
The average monthly expenditure per household increased by about 23 % 
during 1992-93 as compared to 1990-91 while the income rose by about 13 % 
on average, thus further eroding saving capacity of the people, according 
to HIES.
    
Worst affected were rural households whose nominal incomes during 1990-93 
rose by only 4.6%, as against an increase of 23.7% in their monthly 
expenditure, thus leaving a negative change of 19.1%. Their monthly income 
has been computed in  HIES as Rs 3070 in 1992-93, only Rs 139 more than in 
1990-91, while their expenditure climbed by Rs 600 from Rs 2527 to Rs 3127.

On all-Pakistan basis, the average monthly income per household went up by 
13% from Rs 3168 to Rs. 3590, as against 23% increase in expenditure from 
Rs 2851 to Rs 3516. Given double digit inflation persisting in Pakistan 
during the period, these statistics indicate that even the urban families 
in middle income brackets scarcely broke even.

<a name="rank">Pakistan ranks 7th in consumer prices growth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Aug 31: Pakistan recorded seventh highest growth rate in 
consumer prices among East and South Asian countries during 1995, according 
to an IMF report. 
   
In a table of 29 countries included in the World Economic Outlook, May 
1996, document of the IMF, Pakistan is shown to have undergone a sharp 
rise in consumer prices from 9.5% in 1992 and 9.4% in 1993 to 12.5% in 
1994. It is on the basis of the sky high benchmark established in that year 
that the consumer prices are pegged 0.2% lower at 12.3% last year. 
According to the table, Myanmar topped all the countries in terms of 
consumer prices with a growth of 28.9%.
  
The other countries which were ahead of Pakistan in this respect included: 
Vietnam (13.1%); Afghanistan (14.0%), China (14.8%), Laos (19.7%) and Papua 
New Guinea (15.9%). In 1996, the IMF report expects the inflation in 
Pakistan to remain above 9% (9.2% to be exact) owing, among other factors, 
to unremitting depreciation of the rupee.

requirements of the country, has advised Islamabad to withdraw LoS if these 
projects fail to reach financial closure in the allowed time.
    
In a letter to government of Pakistan late last month, the World Bank also 
predicted a 25 per cent rise in power tariffs with the private sector 
projects going on stream next year and promised to help WAPDA and other 
concerned bodies to overcome difficulties in implementing the expected 
increase.
    
Taking note of the local fears being expressed about the viability of power 
generation by private sector and resultant rise in power tariffs, the World 
Bank in its letter also advised the government to ensure that the private 
thermal power policy continues to be implemented.
    
A failure to do so could create a serious backlash resulting in a massive 
erosion of investor confidence in Pakistan. Such an erosion would have 
repercussions that would extend far beyond the power sector, warned Mr Per 
Ljung, World Banks energy and project finance chief (South Asia region) in 
the letter of July 29 addressed to Mr V. A. Jafarey, prime ministers 
adviser on finance and economic affairs.

Extending World Banks unqualified endorsement to the private power policy 
Mr Per Ljung termed it as the most straight forward and well thought out 
policies in place in any developing country.
    
Disagreeing with the argument that the demand for power would slow down 
considerably in Pakistan in the short and medium term, Mr Per Ljung quoted 
from World Bank studies which had estimated that Pakistan would require an 
installed generating capacity of 19,900 MW before Ghazi Barotha comes on 
stream in 2001.
    
He also pointed out that there was a large unmet demand for electric power 
in the country, furthermore, only half of the population has access to 
power and the per capita consumption remains very low at 300kWh.
    
Arguing against the suggestion that the private power would be too 
expensive, Mr Per Ljung said that price offered to the private investors in 
Pakistan was well within line with international experience.

<a name="thee">The elusive foreign investment target</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

PAKISTAN has set itself an annual investment target of $5 billion from the 
year 2,000, while India has set a target of $10 billion, preferably from 
the current year.
    
While the reformist Indian finance minister, Chidamparam, is confident of 
India receiving such a large foreign investment, Mr Mohibullah Shah, 
secretary of Pakistans Board of Investment regards the $5 billion 
investment target by the end of the century a reasonable target.
    
And he is encouraged by his assertion that foreign investment last year was 
a billion dollars compared to $450 million in the preceding year.
    
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, on her part, claims that the total foreign 
investment during the three years of her government had risen to $ 3.2 
billion, and that that was the outcome of her many foreign tours. She did 
not provide a break-up of that large figure.
    
According to the State Bank of Pakistans Annual Report for 1994-95, 
foreign investment in the first year of her current tenure, 1993-94, was 
$649 million and in the second year it rose to $1,530 million, inclusive of 
$862 million received through the sale of 10 per cent of the Pakistan 
Telecommunications shares abroad. And last year the investment was $1 
billion, says Mr. Mohibullah Shah, and asserts they were not MOUs but funds 
verifiable by the State Bank of Pakistan.
    
Evidently, all that investment did not come as cash but was largely 
equipment which came from abroad for power generation and oil exploration. 
So the total comes to $3.2 billion dollars only if the sale proceeds of 
$862 million of PTC shares are included.
    
The PTC sale meant foreign investment all right, but in reality it was 
replacement capital.
    
The need of the country right now is to attract foreign investment in the 
manufacturing sector, prefer ably for exports. A great deal of foreign 
exchange will have to be spent on importing furnace oil for the power 
plants set up in Pakistan, for spare parts over the years and to repatriate 
the profits they will be making. The total can be around $2.5 billion and 
that kind of money could be earned only if we exported more and more, more 
of the truly value-added, otherwise with a balance of trade deficit of $3 
billion, and balance of payments deficit of $3.3 billion, we may see the 
foreign investment aggravating our balance of payments instead of improving 
it. Enhanced power production at a high cost has to be matched with an 
expansion in the capacity of its users for productive and export purposes. 
Otherwise the mismatch between higher power production and its non-
productive use will confront Pakistan with a worse balance of payments 
crisis.
    
Of course, if the foreign investment can come for import substitution and 
rely largely on raw materials produced in Pakistan, it can reduce our 
import bill which rose to $11.7 billion against the target of $10.4 billion 
last year.
    
Walls Ice Cream, produced by Lever Brothers, who have taken over Polka as 
well, is a classic case of increasing the import of raw materials to meet 
the new demand for ice cream created by its advertising. It has been 
importing milk worth half-a-million dollars from New Zealand to make the 
ice cream.
    
Unless foreign investors are coming in the manufacturing sector to export 
or will use indigenous raw materials largely when they help in import 
substitution they can aggravate our balance of payments, and even more when 
such profits are to be repatriated.
    
Mr. Mohibullah Shah says a major development in the inflow of foreign 
direct investment is its diversification. The investment is coming in 
different new productive facility or manufacturing capacity.
    
Surely a target of $5 billion is a large leap from the average of $1 
billion per year achieved during the last three years, and Pakistan has to 
strive relentlessly for that. However, Mr. Mohibullah Shah says the long-
term approach of the government in policy-making has greatly enhanced the 
faith of the investors to make investment in big projects.

Major setback
    
Foreign investment suddenly had a major setback following the sudden 
cancellation of the 12 Special Industrial Zones which offered generous tax 
concessions and other facilities to foreign investors which made them 
interested in those zones a great deal. The cancellation came under 
pressure from the IMF which sought a reduction of the tax exemptions all 
around, as the current budget indicates, and not an extension even for 
attracting foreign investment in a big way. The SIZ also invited protests 
from the already established foreign investors in Pakistan that the new 
investors were being favoured a great deal at the cost of the old investors 
who had played a pioneering role in the country. the government is now 
taking up the issue of the Special Industrial Zones with the IMF, possibly 
with reduced concessions to the investors.
    
The bulk of foreign investment, particularly US investment which tops all 
foreign investment in Pakistan now has been coming in the power generation 
sector followed by oil exploration., But since the government has decided 
not to create an excess capacity in this area with too many power producers 
and too few major consumers large further investment in the sector will 
come down, unless that be to replace some of the companies which signed 
MOUs and obtained letter of support but did not follow up.
    
However, if the privatisation of large power projects as at Jamshoro, KESC, 
some units of WAPDA, and even the Heavy Mechanical Complex, were treated as 
foreign investment, the foreign investment figures could rise substantially 
which is a very healthy sign. They include oil and gas, power generation, 
agro-industries, food and chemicals.
    
He says most of the US companies which entered the Pakistan market recently 
have established a solid base within a very short span of time. He spoke of 
the General Tyre and Rubber company, which had made a investment of $40 to 
45 million within eight months period and its propensity to export tyres to 
the Gulf and Central Asia. That is the kind of foreign investment we need: 
both to meet domestic needs and to export. But then General Tyre has been 
in Pakistan for a long time under the late Gen. Habibullah.
    
He spoke of the Chrysler International Corporation of the US which plans 
local manufacture of the famous Chrysler Cherokee jeeps soon, in 
partnership the Penta Motor Industries of Pakistan.
    
The issue which now arises is: how many foreign motor car companies are we 
going to have when we already have quite a number and prices of their 
products have been going up due to the steady devaluation of the rupee, 
rising taxes, and the costly insurance premium they demand in our insecure 
environment.
    
Of course, Pakistan could earn a substantial amount through foreign 
portfolio investment or sale of shares of companies listed in Pakistan. 
That, however, seems to be a kind of two-way flow. While some money comes 
from one end more money is going out after making sizeable profits or 
before the buyers could suffer large losses.

Steady devaluation
    
They are also upset by the steady devaluation of the rupee which makes 
their shares lose their value in dollars.
    
A recent report said shares worth $25 million were bought by foreign 
investors in the first four months of the year, but how much of that was 
sold following the steady fall in shares prices and the hopelessness in the 
stock market is not known.
    
The fact is that large foreign investment calls for political stability, 
economic stability with a budget that does not burst like a bomb over the 
heads of investors each year, a good labour policy and a stable legal 
framework marked for rule of law and social liberalism.

<a name="bank">Banks stopped from financing modarabas</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Sept 4: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has asked all commercial 
banks to stop financing modarabas on their own. The move has triggered 
mixed reaction among modaraba managers most of whom fear it may hit small 
modarabas engaged in trading.
    
An SBP circular issued on Tuesday says, the banks may provide finances to 
modarabas only after seeking a prior clearance from the NBFIs Regulation & 
Supervision Department of the SBP. The decision has taken effect 
immediately.

The decision is going to create a negative perception about the 
modarabas, said the chairman of Modarabas Association of Pakistan Mr 
Fakhir Rehman.
    
But in real terms it may not have an adverse impact, he said but made it 
clear it was his personal view. He linked his optimism to his expectation 
that the SBP will not delay a clearance unnecessarily.

Mr Rehman said the decision may have its impact mainly on the modarabas 
engaged in trading. But I believe the SBP has taken the decision to ensure 
that the health of the financial sector is protected.
    
The number of modarabas operating in the country is 53 but only a small 
number of themroughly one thirdmanage to seek financing facilities from 
commercial banks. The rest stand no chance partly because of their ill- 
performance and partly due to high borrowing cost.
    
Chief executives of some leading modarabas interviewed individually said 
they would request the association to meet and discuss the issue in detail. 
The association should ask the SBP what had spurred it to take the 
decision and how it would determine whether or not to allow bank financing 
to a modaraba, one of them said.
    
While the circular is silent on what prompted the SBP to take the decision, 
modaraba managers believe the recent detection of financial irregularities 
at a big business house might be an immediate reason.
    
The business house in question also owns a modaraba and those in the know 
of things say the charges against which it is facing legal actions include 
dishonouring of a large number of letters of credit.
    
Bankers say the overall deteriorating performance of modarabas might be a 
rather more valid reason for the SBP decision. The decision seems to have 
spurred from the need to protect banks from making imprudent financing, 
said a senior executive of a private bank. Since the majority of modarabas 
is not performing well, it is only logical to monitor bank financing in 
this sector.

<a name="conf">Conflicting demands of business, IMF</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M Ziauddin
    
The government seems to have been caught between the devil and the deep 
sea. On the one hand, the business community is continuously forcing it to 
withdraw tax measures affecting the unearned incomes of some of its members 
and on the other, the IMF is refusing to come to its aid unless the 
likelihood of any changes in the Finance Act passed by the sovereign body, 
called the National Assembly is precluded completely.
    
Meanwhile, the combined effect of an abnormal expansion in the foreign 
trade gap last year, to a massive $ 3.2 billion and the 11 to 13 per cent 
rate of inflation in the last 14 months has brought the exchange rate under 
great pressure, resulting in a continuous slide of the rupee, not only in 
the last year, but also in the first 50 days of the current financial year.
    
Foreign exchange reserves (FER) are up at $ 1.9 billion. But this provides 
a misleading picture, because the amount in the foreign exchange currency 
deposits estimated to be around $ 7.5 billion has also been in use since 
early 1991 when exchange controls were lifted. Therefore, whatever amount 
that is shown in the FERs, if it is less than $ 7.5 billion, it is in fact 
a liability rather than an asset.
    
Debt servicing is a continuous obligation all through the year, but in the 
months of September-October, it peaks. And the expected peak this year is 
estimated to be about $ 700 million. So, in the absence of the concessional 
tranches of the IMF, amounting to around $ 160 million and the expected 
pressure in the current quarter on the FERs from the escalating imports, it 
is feared that the Government of Pakistan (GOP) would find it too difficult 
to mobilise the resources required for the upcoming amortisation.
    
Incidentally, the most contentious issue between the business community and 
the government is the imposition of general sales tax (GST). The government 
is trying every trick in the book to get the business community to accept 
the measure, while the business community is using every threat in its bag 
to force the government to withdraw it.
    
The GST is estimated to bring in more than half of the additional taxes of 
Rs41 billion proposed in the current years budget. Most of the remaining 
income from additional taxes has been proposed to be collected from 
increases in the rates of excise duties which, even the supporters of the 
new budget find it hard to defend and they readily agree that it was an 
inflationary and regressive measure.
    
The principle is when you impose GST, the excise duties are withdrawn and 
more so, when the GST rates are as high as 23, 18, 15 and 10 per cent.
    
During the last financial year, large scale manufacturing remained constant 
at around three per cent reflecting stagnation in investment, production 
and domestic supplies leading to a very low export growth. The stagnation 
in investment has been partly attributed to the denial of its full 
allocation of bank credits to the private sector, as more than double of 
public sector credit allocation was mopped up by the government.
    
Prime Ministers advisor on Finance, Mr V.A. Jaffarey believes that the 
stagnation in the manufacturing sector had occurred last year partly 
because the lead industry (textiles) has been suffering from over capacity 
for some time. He expected the private sector investment to pick up in the 
coming months as the sponsors of independent power plants for which 
financial closures have been achieved are soon expected to start their 
spade work and launch the civil engineering phase. As much as one billion 
dollars worth of investment is expected to start flowing in the power 
sector during the next 10 months.
    
In another positive development, exports have increased by about 10 per 
cent in the very first month of the current year while imports have 
stagnated around 2.8 per cent, perhaps in response to massive depreciation 
of the rupee in the last 13 months. As a result, the foreign trade gap has 
contracted by eight per cent, compared to the corresponding period last 
year.
    
If this trend continues over the remaining part of the year, the pressure 
on the FERs is expected to ease considerably perhaps replenishing the FERs 
back to over $ 3 billion, the amount which was in the kitty at the start of 
the financial year 1995-96.
    
Reports of another bumper crop are in the air. The initial estimates of 
cotton for this year are to the tune of 12-13 million bales. If this 
materialises, the country is likely to have at least about three million 
bales of exportable surpluses this year and the balance would be enough to 
keep the supplies for the value added industry in abundance and at economic 
rates.
    
This is the time for the government to offer international prices to cotton 
growers through the Cotton Export Corporation, but on condition that they 
would agree to pay tax on their agricultural incomes. Here, it would not be 
out of place to warn the farmers not to confuse the issue by including the 
freight differential between New York and Karachi in their reckoning of the 
international cotton prices.
    
The expectations are, that the rupee would slide to Rs 40 a dollar by the 
end of December, 1996. Its value at present is nearly Rs 36 to a dollar 
officially, while the kerb rate is as much as Rs 39.10. This level of 
depreciation would surely put a hold on unnecessary imports and create the 
right climate inside the country for accelerated investment in suitable 
import substitution and export sectors. A realistic rate of the rupee is 
also expected to enable the government to reduce the tariff rates to around 
45 per cent as per the IMF prescription without the fear of an import 
deluge in the face of the not so satisfactory FERs.
    
The process of privatisation is also expected to bring in another at least 
$ 2 billion during the year as the Jamshoro power plant and the 26 per cent 
strategic shares of PTCL are likely to be sold off before the end of the 
current financial year. The two commercial banks, United Bank Limited and 
Habib Bank Limited along with at least one more development finance 
institution would also be privatised during the year, if the government 
decides to make sincere efforts to sell them, without trying to have the 
cake and eat it too.

<a name="kara">Karachi Stock Exchange moves over to ensure transparency</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Aslam

KARACHI STOCK EXCHANGE (KSE) joined the select band of fully- developed 
world stock markets, after it switched over to partial computerised trading 
and analysts believe it will lead to greater transparency in the share 
business, one of the major demands of foreign investors.
    
What is computerised or electronic trading? How will it ensure transparency 
in transactions or attract foreign investors and how will the general 
investor benefit from it, are some of the questions being asked by many.
    
In manual trading there is scope of price manipulation by those who hold 
the key, as investors seldom get the price mentioned in the official 
fluctuation list. Subsequently, there always was a difference of 25 to 50 
paisa in the selling and buying prices, but investors had no option but to 
rely on the figures provided by the agents or brokers.
    
But with computerised trading, this will be eliminated to a greater extent, 
as the computer has a sharp vision and tremendous electronic power to 
transmit the agreed rate of share transactions to millions of viewers 
around the world through the Reuters cable network.
    
Under the computerised stock trading network, members or agents of the KSE 
will operate from their offices. They will trade in securities through the 
computer installed within their premises. The sharp eye of the computer 
will mark the selling and buying rate and route the transaction directly to 
the clearing house for settlement of the dues.
    
Apart from being a big saving on time and manpower, the brokerage houses as 
well as investors will have a clear picture of deals struck, thereby 
eliminating even vague chances of dispute between the buyer and sellers.
    
Automation has its own demerits too, the chief being its capacity to 
displace manpower or manual labour, said a leading broker. But it was the 
need of the our as most of the foreign investors and the nine foreign funds 
operating on the KSE have some reservations about the existing levels of 
transparency in the share business.
    
It is more important because of the fact that Pakistan has recently joined 
the Federation of Euro-Asia Stock Exchanges (FEASE), which is expected to 
pave the way for a greater inflow of foreign investment in shares, 
financial analysts said. It is an important milestone in the trading 
history of the KSE and credit must go the team led by its president Arif 
Habib, said a foreign fund manager who is operating in the market for a 
couple of years. He went on to add that there have been frequent complaints 
from many foreign investors about the transparency of transactions 
primarily because of manual handling of the stock business, but now most of 
them are expected to be removed after the trading was fully computerise 
possibly by the end of the current year.
    
Pakistans stock market has been on the top of the emerging market list 
since the early 90s and had attracted massive foreign buying, as the 
earning per share was around 25 to 30 per cent. But the Karachi killings of 
1995 witnessed the outflow of the foreign capital, analysts said.
    
Stock analysts were of the opinion that switching over to electronic 
trading has assumed an added importance in the wake of the recently set up 
Asian Smaller Companies Fund by the Templeton Asset Management of the US in 
Singapore.
    
Many Pakistani companies might not fall in line with the investment 
criteria of the new Singapore fund, nevertheless, some MNCs stand a good 
chance to attract fresh foreign buying, they added.
    
The KSE authorities, have initially selected eight sectors, ICP mutual 
funds, modarabas, leasing, banks, insurance, synthetic and chemical, cement 
and chemical and pharmaceutical shares which together total 294 or about 
half of the total listed 785 scrips for computerised trading.
    
But we hope to cover the entire list by the end of the current year, if 
all goes well with the trial run, said a member of the KSE.
    
Some analysts are of the view that the choice of sectors for electronic 
trading is debatable, as it did not included the most active scrips, 
including Hub-Power and PTC vouchers. Energy sector should have been the 
obvious choice before the selectors as it would have added the much needed 
depth to the new experiment, they added.
    
Many technicalities are involved in the switch over but we are expected to 
master them during the next few weeks, said a member who indulged in 
electronic transactions for the first time.

<a name="kses">KSE shares index breaks 1,400 barrier </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 4: The KSE 100-share index breached the psychological barrier 
of 1,400 points on Wednesday at 1,388.19 on panic selling spurred by news 
of second US missile attack on Iraq and fears of another Gulf war. The 
selling in part was prompted by the perceptions of bleak economic outlook 
at least for the near-term.
    
It had touched its career-lowest level at 1,323.53 on November 28, 1995, on 
news of heavy casualties in the city in terrorist attacks and rumours of a 
further devaluation of the rupee just at the heels of 7.5 per cent already 
announced by the central bank in late October that year.
    
The Gulf war might not be imminent but oil now will be too expensive and 
that worries investors, said an analyst.
    
But there was no matching buying which could absorb the mounting selling 
offers from all and sundry as investors appeared to be in a bit hurry to 
get out of the market.
    
The KSE 100-share index finally shed another 24.03 points at 1,388.19 
points as compared to 1,412.22 a day earlier as base shares came in for 
renewed selling.
    
The sell-off has some other local bearish factor behind it, notably among 
them arrests of some top corporate giants for alleged bank loan default and 
reported voluntary winding up of two modaraba companies. Analysts said the 
winding up of Dawood group of companies modaraba, being quoted at around Rs 
8.25 against its face value of Rs 10, provided a pleasant surprise to 
investors as no other big business house has done it before, although most 
of the modaraba companies are said to be not in an ideal financial position 
after this sector was brought under the tax net some years back.
    
The management of Paramount Modaraba also did not give any reason for the 
close of business but it was certainly doing well financially as is 
reflected by its ruling share price around Rs 4 against the face value of 
Rs 10.
    
However, there were no wide price fluctuations in their share values after 
the news as the managements of both have reportedly undertaken to pay back 
shareholders at the face value of Rs 10.
    
Thus, it was not a single bearish factor but a combination of them which 
continued to inspire selling from all and sundry, pushing prices further 
lower across a broad front.
    
The market might not collapse as its some of the basic fundamentals are 
not that weak but it might take quite sometime to be back on the rails, 
analysts said.
    
They said the current political confrontation is another deterrent as 
investors are not inclined to make fresh buying until the dust is clear.
    
But rather everyone appeared to be in a bit haste to get out of the market 
as early as possible to save themselves from fresh losses, they added. 
Minus signs, therefore, again dominated the list, most of the MNCs being 
the worst-hit owing to persistent selling but not many willing buyers.
    
Siemens Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser, Telecard, Parke-Davis, ALICO, Lever 
Brothers, Grays of Cambridge and Cyanamid Pakistan being prominent among 
them, falling by Rs 2 to 10.
    
Among the local blue chips, which followed them, ICP SEMF, Orix Leasing, 
Bank of Punjab, Faysal Bank, Mustehkam Cement, Dewan Salman and Adamjee 
Insurance were leading, which suffered fall ranging from one rupee to Rs 
4.75, the biggest being in Adamjee Insurance. All other shares also fell 
generally but fractionally as selling did not assume an alarming 
proportion. Among the leading MNCs, Shell Pakistan was an exception which 
rose further by Rs 2 on stray short-covering followed by Atlas Lease, Lease 
Pakistan and Kohinoor Sugar, which rose by one rupee each. Other gains were 
fractional.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, lower 30 paisa on 4.394 
million shares followed by PTC vouchers, off 60 paisa on 4.045 million, 
Dewan Salman, down Rs 1.10 on 1.755 million, Fauji Fertiliser, off Rs 3.15 
on 0.774 million, Dhan Fibre, lower 35 paisa on 0.556 million shares. Other 
actively traded shares were led by Lucky Cement, off 45 paisa on 0.304 
million shares, and Sitara Energy, unchanged on 91,500 shares. 
 
Trading volume rose to 20.649 million shares from the overnights 11.776 
million shares owing to hasty selling in the current favourites.
    
There were 331 actives out of which 195 shares fell, 55 rose with 81 
holding on to the last levels.
    
On the corporate front, the board of directors of Balochistan Particle 
Board has announced a cash dividend at the rate of 15 per cent for the last 
year ended June 30, 1996.
    
Later in the evening computerised session, the KSE 100-share index moved 
further down by 1.93 points at 1,386.26 on renewed selling in the base 
shares. Business activity was relatively large rising to 107,000 shares, 
bulk of which, 76,500 shares, went to the credit of Dewan Salman. Other 
actives included Dawood Leasing, Schon Bank, Fauji Fertiliser and FFC-
Jordan Fertiliser. Out of the five actives, two each rose and fell while 
the 5th was quoted unchanged.

<a name="abri">A brief moment of elation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

OURS has become such a fractured society, so divided are we into bits and 
pieces of angry conviction that we even blame natural calamities on one 
another. 
   
There seems to be no meeting point on which, we as a people, can collect 
together. Differences of opinion have become vendettas. Or so it seemed 
until last week when at The Oval, on a balmy evening (which spread out 
against the sky) Wasim Akram and his men took a cricket ball, made it swing 
and spin and demolished Englands batting. There was an outpouring of joy, 
spontaneous celebrations, all memories were lost, all sorrows forgotten, 
all sins forgiven (Bangalore). The entire nation was uplifted as if it had 
been administered a massive shot of adrenaline. One was well aware that the 
moment would soon pass, that it was the most transient of elations but 
while it lasted it felt good.
    
I happened to be in Islamabad on this particular evening and had been 
invited to dinner by a friend. Normally, I shy away from social gatherings 
as I find it increasingly difficult to make small talk and I find it 
tiresome to listen to rumours that are being constantly recycled, the same 
rumours that one has been hearing for years with only a change in the cast 
of characters (and villains). But I was persuaded to go to this dinner and 
am glad that I did so. In terms of topics of conversation, it was a single 
agenda get-together. We spent the entire evening talking of Pakistans 
fabulous win and such was the gusto that one got the impression that it was 
they who had wielded the willow and it was they who had extracted magic 
from the leather ball. At my hotel, every member of the staff seemed busy 
in congratulating one another and because I am identified with cricket, 
they made a special point in coming up to me to share their happiness.
    
There was a certain irony in all this. My mind went back to Bangalore. On 
my way back, I had to transit Delhi and our High Commissioner Riaz Khokar 
had given a lunch for the cricket team who too were in transit. He was kind 
enough to invite me to the lunch. The players looked really in the dumps, 
forlorn, lost and almost frightened. They told me of the threats their 
families had received, effigies had been burnt, their houses stoned. They 
feared for their lives. Their flight had been re-routed and they would go 
to Karachi instead of Lahore where a reception committee was awaiting 
their arrival. Already accusations were flying about that the bookies had 
got to the team. I spoke to some of the players, tried to buck them up but 
their morale had been shattered. These cricketers had become arch-enemies 
of the country. It was all out of proportion, a hysterical response but it 
showed how intensely and deeply involved the people were in cricket. I saw 
this as a silver lining. It showed this despite the political divisiveness 
which has turned bitter, the people cared, national pride had not been 
blunted. At the same time one became acutely conscious of the fact that 
this same public tended to be fickle in its affections and garlands of 
marigold could be turned into garlands of old shoes and winning and losing 
decided what kind of garlands they would bring to greet the team. It seemed 
to be a highly unstable relationship that apart from being inherently 
unstable was conditional. It was certainly not for better or for worse.
    
We should not make the same mistake, this time in reverse. We should temper 
our enthusiasm with the knowledge that the team cannot keep winning all the 
time and it is bound to lose at some stage. It is a part of the game. We 
should learn to be both good losers and good winners. And this applies more 
generally. We must accept that there will be good times and there will be 
bad times.
    
I have been a firm believer that our sportsmen can make an important 
contribution in turning around the somewhat murky image of Pakistan. This 
particular cricket team made a lot of friends for Pakistan and wiped out 
the memory of the previous tour when Pakistan was being called cheats, 
quite wrongly and unfairly but being called cheats all the same. There was 
some apprehension that the whole distasteful exercise would be repeated 
again but I think the English are reconciled to being losers and they might 
as well be good losers. The message of John Major to Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto was a most gracious one. But that is because John Major is an almost 
fanatic cricket fan and one saw him at most of the test matches, prompting 
me to inquire when he did any work! But it was and is instructive that he 
went to the matches without any fuss and the chances are that most people 
at the ground did not know that the was present. The same applied to a 
former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke who too was a great cricket fan. 
I remember once sitting in the press box in Melbourne and he was there a 
few rows behind me. He was Prime minister then and nobody appeared to take 
much notice of him. He certainly did not have a bunch of chamchas hovering 
around him. In other words, he did not inconvenience other spectators. He 
came to the match to enjoy the cricket and made sure that others were also 
able to do the same.
    
It was good to hear someone like Ian Botham praising the Pakistan team and 
Wasim Akram in particular. There was an element of poetic justice. Botham 
was in the vanguard of those who had accused the Pakistan bowlers of ball 
tampering. Now his praise for them was unqualified as were the reports in 
the British newspapers who acknowledge that Pakistan had won cleanly. That 
too is a victory of sorts.

<a name="turn">Turning the other cheek</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

TO forgive may indeed be divine in an individual, but as a nation, we may 
be carrying this virtue a bit too far.
    
In a recent article in a Lahore daily, Mir Murtaza Bhutto pointed out that 
in Pakistans 50-year history, nobody had ever been held accountable for 
anything ranging from the assassination of Liaquat Ali khan to the break-up 
of the country in 1971. Frequent military coups and the abrogation of three 
constitutions have remained similarly unpunished as has the judicial murder 
of an elected prime minister.
    
As a counterpoint to our laid back, laissez-faire attitude, just across our 
eastern border, the former prime minister of India and many of his cabinet 
colleagues are being dragged over the coals for allegations of corruption. 
Further to the east, a South Korea court has sentenced a former president 
to death and another one to 22 years imprisonment. The charges include 
corruption, the overthrow of a legal government and the misuse of power. In 
South Africa, senior members of the white apartheid regime have been found 
guilty of a wide range of crimes against the black majority.
    
In Pakistan, what happens to those involved in conspiracies against the 
state and elected governments? They write newspaper articles in praise of 
democracy, or serve as advisers to prime ministers. Some of them get 
appointed our ambassadors to foreign capitals, while still others live it 
up in apartments and villas bought abroad with money extorted as bribes and 
commissions when they were in power. In several cases, their sons have 
successfully entered politics using this same tainted money as a spring-
board. Whatever their fate, none of them has ever been put to the 
inconvenience and embarrassment of having to appear in court or face public 
accusations of any kind.
    
Take the case of Irfanullah Marwat as an example. As adviser to Chief 
Minister Jam Sadiq, he was allegedly involved in a long list of crimes from 
kidnapping to car-lifting. He was also a scourge of PPP workers, filling 
Sindhs jails with political dissidents. While his sidekick Sami Marwat, 
head of the dreaded CIA, languishes in jail, the elder Marwat is living 
peacefully and comfortably, dividing his time between Islamabad and 
Peshawar. Meanwhile, several criminal cases registered against him remain 
pending. Although he was riding roughshod over the people of Karachi only 
four years ago, there is no public outcry, no newspaper campaign to force 
the government to make him pay for his misdeeds.
    
Apart from the lack of any legal sanction against these people, there seems 
to be no public indignation or anger over their misdeeds. Even those 
convicted of crimes like drug trafficking are lionised by Pakistani society 
after serving their time. Invariably, they claim to be victimised for their 
beliefs, and get invited to all the parties as soon as they are out of 
jail. 
    
Even Mir Murtaza Bhutto chose to appoint Subak Majeed, somebody who had 
served several years in a British jail for drug smuggling, as his right-
hand man. The same Subak Majeed sat in Jam Sadiqs lap during the 
persecution of the PPP in Sindh.
    
Such examples can be multiplied a hundred-fold. The present federal cabinet 
and the national and provincial assemblies are full of individuals who were 
just as happy to serve Zia-ul-Haq and his junta. The Prime Minister has 
chosen to surround herself with holdovers from previous regimes known for 
their hatred for her, her father and her party. It seems that her method of 
neutralising her enemies is to offer them party tickets and choice official 
assignments.
    
Take Haji Nawaz Khokhar as a prime example of the prevailing forgive and 
forget mood. Here is a politician notorious in Islamabad and Rawalpindi 
for his free and easy ways with other peoples land. In a well-publicised 
case, as Deputy Speaker during the previous government, he held up a 
serving colonel and his family at gunpoint for the crime of having 
scratched his official limousine. A staunch supporter of Nawaz Sharif, he 
was arrested on a number of serious charges by this government when it came 
to power in 1993. Soon, lo and behold, he was released and welcomed to the 
folds of the ruling party.
    
Recently, Khokhar is said to have played a distinguished role in winning 
the Azad Kashmir elections for the PPP by using the simple but reliable 
expedient of not permitting genuine voters from approaching the election 
booths in Rawalpindi where many of them are registered. Obviously, it is 
considered useful to have somebody like him in the cabinet when the next 
general election rolls around. 
    
And to underline this governments commitment to research and development, 
who better to appoint Minister for Science and Technology than Haji Nawaz 
Khokhar? To celebrate this appointment, his supporters spent several hours 
and several thousand bullets firing their Kalashnikovs in the air, despite 
the ban on the display of firearms in the nations capital. No signal 
regarding this governments commitment to eliminate the flourishing gun 
culture could have been louder.
    
How do some people manage to erase sins committed in the media limelight so 
quickly? Or to put it another way, why is public memory so short? Not only 
do we forgive and forget in a matter of months, we vote the same rascals 
back into office time and time again. Inevitably, the lack of 
accountability in our brand of democracy is forcing influential figures and 
institutions to question the system itself.
    
One problem in elected governments enforcing even the most rudimentary 
accountability is their narrow support base in parliament. In their blind 
compulsion to stay in power, they are very vulnerable to blackmail from 
their supporters. 
    
Rather than discipline their ministers and MPs, successive prime ministers 
and chief ministers have chosen the more expedient path of packing their 
already-swollen cabinets with incompetents and crooks.
    
But while this explains why our leaders connive in venality of every 
description, we are still left in the dark about our willingness to forgive 
and forget whatever the provocation from public figures and criminals 
alike; indeed, there is often no difference between them. 
   
However, whatever the cause, the mafia that rules the destiny of this 
nation will continue taking us for suckers as long we keep turning the 
other cheek.

<a name="cele">Celebrating 50 years of waste</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD: It has been the irony of history that the largest number of 
medals go to the soldiers of the losing army, as if stringing metal 
trinkets on spotless uniforms would wash away the stains of incompetence 
and failure. In a similar vein, countries with nothing or little to show in 
terms of real progress trumpet their development by creating awe-inspiring 
monuments to commemorate their non-existent progress. It was perhaps for 
this very reason that our rulers deemed it fit to spend as much as 
Rs646,325 million on erecting such a monument while the nation scraped the 
bottom of the barrel to come up with external debt repayments, while the 
rupee lost its value by the day, while everyone walked in fear of an 
imminent fiscal disaster.
    
But as far as the non-chalant information minister was concerned, he could 
have been talking about something as cheap as a loaf of bread, not that 
bread loaf, too, would remain that cheap in the coming days. Replying to a 
question posed by oppositions Rao Qaiser, he said the monument would be a 
befitting monument for the 50th independence of Pakistans independence. 
Independence from what, one could have asked. We need to beg the Americans 
to return our money that we paid for buying weapons, we depend on IMF and 
World Banks kindness to see us through our financial winter, we depend on 
India to save us from signing the dreaded CTBT.....what independence are we 
celebrating that justifies the creation of a fancy building on top of a 
hill. Mr Kharal assured the House that the committee he was overseeing 
would keep the cost within the original budget.
    
That contention was, however, challenged almost immediately by Rao Qaiser 
who asserted that the cost overruns were already nearing the Rs1 billion 
mark and vowed to bring a privilege motion against the information minister 
for distorting the facts, lying being an unparliamentary term. While Raos 
billion mark fear may have been on a rather higher side there is very 
serious apprehension about vaulting costs at the other important house on 
the hill. The occupant of that hill told a senator that according to 
estimates provided to him the monument would easily touch the Rs 850 
million mark.
    
The opposition clamour notwithstanding, the information minister appeared 
over the moon while talking about all that the # convention centre would 
offer. The multi-million-rupee masterpiece is supposed to provide a state 
of the art centre for holding international conferences and symposiums and 
would also house a five-star luxury hotel. Maybe the next time the centre 
issue comes up for discussion the information minister may like to 
enlighten how many similar convention centres have been set up by the 
government right across our hostile border because somehow, despite the 
absence of such massive undertakings, the Indians have been managing to 
hold some of the biggest and busiest international conferences.
    
They must be fools because instead of spending hundreds of millions on 
creating glitzy buildings, the same money is being pumped into the 
improvement of the basic infrastructure. The foreign investor does not come 
because of the decor of the conference room but because of the 
infrastructure and stable investment policies of the country. But then when 
it comes to public money in Pakistan, who has ever given a damn. On second 
thought the building of this monument might be a perfect idea to celebrate 
fifty years of waste.

<a name="cert">Certainly not a lady in distress</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

FOR someone whose imminent ouster has become the staple of pundit 
discussion these days, Ms Bhutto looks like a remarkably confident person. 
To watch her in public, which really means to watch her on television, is 
scarcely to get the impression that she is on her way out. It could easily 
be that she is living in a world of her own and is cut off from reality. 
But it is equally possible for her critics to be looking at things through 
the wrong end of the telescope.
    
Back in 1994 when the PML (N) had launched its Movement for Deliverance 
the government gave a beleaguered look. Some of the more thoughtful members 
of Mian Nawaz Sharifs party now reluctantly admit that if at that time the 
opposition had made a serious offer of talks, Ms Bhutto would have come 
gladly to the negotiating table. It might then have been possible, say 
these same people, to discuss a constitutional package with the PPP 
including the holding of early elections. But with the PML (N) suffering 
from a crisis of clarity  not knowing what it wanted or what, in the 
circumstances, it could hope to achieve  that opportunity was frittered 
away.
    
Today for all the dire forecasts made by retired and serving World Bank 
mandarins, about how bad the economic situation is, the government is not 
giving a beleaguered look. If there is an economic disaster waiting to 
happen, this possibility is not reflected in the sparkle which is to be 
seen in the Prime Ministers eyes or the blitheness accompanying many of 
her actions. Asif Zardari may be accused of many things and in purist 
circles Nawaz Khokhar may be considered the prime example of a turncoat but 
that scarcely stops the Prime minister from naming them to the cabinet. 
Some people might say this is bad politics; others will see it as a mark of 
confidence. The Prime Minister wants to do something. She goes ahead and 
does it without in the least being concerned about what the Press might 
say.
    
Indeed as far as the Press is concerned the Prime Minister seems to have 
liberated herself completely from its influence. Nothing that appears in 
the Press seems to have the slightest influence on her behaviour or that of 
her government. Damaging stories appear, some heat is generated, the 
government either keeps mum or issues a few half-hearted denials and then, 
the froth having subsided, it is back to business as usual. Take the Surrey 
mansion story which created a commotion when it first appeared but around 
which, despite the purported evidence provided in the National Assembly by 
Nawaz Sharif, the dust appears now to have settled.
    
While the Press is more free and powerful than at any time since 1958, the 
limits to what it can do have also been revealed. Moreover, despite its 
new-found muscle the Press itself is not above being manipulated and 
cajoled. In this connection the circumspection that has crept into much of 
the Press when it comes to mentioning the First Couple will not have been 
lost on more careful newspaper readers.
    
But to return to the sparkle in Ms Bhuttos eyes. She is even speaking 
better than ever before. Take her address to the Bahawalpur Bar Association 
during the course of which she was alternatively sly and humorous and sharp 
in scoring points against Mian Nawaz Sharif and putting a gloss over the 
achievements of her government. As a speaker Ms Bhutto comes close to being 
insufferable when she is strident and high-pitched as is too often the case 
when she is addressing a public meeting. At Bahawalpur, however, she kept 
her tone and pitch low and spoke like an accomplished debator. A few days 
before the Bahawalpur speech, in response to a question regarding the 
opposition campaign against her, the answer she gave, with a slight smile 
on her lips, seemed to mock her opponents. We will have local elections 
this year, she said, then in January 1997 like good Muslims we will all 
fast, then share the happiness of Eid, then celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the nations independence followed by elections not sooner than 1998. If 
Ms Bhutto is indeed on her way out her insouciance betrays not the least 
sign of it. If there is anyone looking confused it is the opposition which 
knows what it wants but does not know how to get it. And if there is a pall 
of gloom settled over anyone it is probably the President who in front of 
visitors no longer makes any attempt to hide what he feels about the Prime 
Minister but who, to judge by appearances, is driven by doubts as to what 
he should do.
    
After all Article 58 2(b) of the constitution is a double- edged sword. 
While it can spell death for an elected government it can also bloody the 
fingers of the person who wields it. When Zia dismissed Junejo in 1988 he 
created more trouble for himself than he had bargained for. When Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan used this weapon in 1990 it was a smooth affair for him. When he 
used it in 1993 he covered himself with ignominy. the moral is obvious. 
Using 58 2(b) is not as easy as it sounds.
    
True, Ms Bhutto may be guilty of over-confidence. But her opponents may be 
guilty of over-estimating her difficulties and under-estimating her 
fighting qualities. Look at the three crises whose outline loomed so large 
in mid-summer: Ms Bhuttos fight with the Supreme Court; the stories of the 
Surrey mansion which were thought to have done grave damage to the 
governments standing and credibility; and the potential effects of what 
was seen on all sides as a killer budget. Where are these crises now?
    
Being the wilful person that she is, the Prime Minister has stuck to her 
guns in her confrontation with the Supreme Court. The judges affected by 
the Supreme Courts March verdict have yet to be dismissed by the 
government. Nor is the government in a hurry to choose their replacements. 
While Benazir Bhutto was certainly ill-advised to seek this confrontation, 
the point remains that she has lived through this crisis while it is the 
Chief Justice who may be showing signs of strain.
    
True, there are some important matters pending before the Supreme Court: 
the local bodies case, Manzoor Wattoos appeal against his dismissal and 
Nasim Wali Khans petition against Aftab Sherpao. While anything can happen 
in these cases, what will not change is the Prime ministers defiant 
attitude towards the Supreme Court. Nor is this attitude as shorn of 
realism as it might appear. Benazir knows when and where to trim her sails. 
She knows through hard-earned experience that she should not trifle with 
the army. She knows that it is in her interests to pander to the whims of 
the PML(J) and the likes of Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan and Maulana Fazlur 
Rehman. But her attitude to the Supreme Court is a bit like Stalins who in 
argument about the Pope cut short the discussion when he asked: How many 
divisions does the Pope have? If the Chief Justice had any divisions at 
his command Ms Bhuttos attitude would certainly have been different.
    
As for Surreygate, for all the damage that it might have done the Prime 
Minister and her husband initially, it has now receded from the forefront 
of public discussion. And as for the budget, despite all the strikes that 
we have seen this summer and despite minor changes here and there, it 
stays. When Qazi Hussain Ahmed tried to launch his movement from Rawalpindi 
it seemed as if the floodgates of public discontent were about to be 
lowered. three months down the road sugar is selling at 22 rupees a kilo 
but the awam are keeping their dissatisfaction to themselves.
    
The received wisdom now is that September and October are going to be 
crucial months for Benazir. Judging by the sparkle in her eyes my hunch is 
that come the new year it will be Benazir and V.A. Jaffrey who will have 
the last laugh rather than any of the World Banks artists who have been 
dabbling in dark paint this summer. If Pakistan defaults on its 
international payments that will be a crisis that everyone will be able to 
feel and see. But if, as is fairly certain, it does not, then who stands to 
benefit from the spin-off: the doomsayers or Benazir Bhutto?
    
In any discussion of the governments performance and its resultant 
standing, let it not be forgotten that peace has been brought to Karachi by 
the ruthless single-mindedness of this government. As recently as the 
middle of last year parts of Karachi had become no-go areas for the law 
enforcing agencies. Today the back of the armed insurgency which threatened 
the city has been broken. Given the effect that the situation in Karachi 
was having on the rest of the country, it is not too much to say that this 
achievement makes up for failures in many other fields.
    
To say all this is not to put Benazir in the league of Metternich or 
Bismarck but only to say that for all her personal failings and the 
weaknesses of her administration she is far from looking like a person who 
is about to go in a hurry.

<a name="euro">Europe: economic paradise or fortress?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto

ITS hard to believe that only 50 years ago, Europe lay in ruins, shattered 
by the most horrible war the world had ever seen. And yet, from the horrors 
of bloodshed, an era of peace and prosperity has dawned that the region has 
never before seen.
    
The rewards of this peace have been increased co-operation and unity, 
leading to unheralded economic prosperity. Today, the European Union is the 
worlds largest trading entity, with more nations eager to join. And it is 
this trend toward increased integration that holds the promise not only of 
regional tranquillity in Europe but prosperity on a global scale  if 
Europe shows a willingness to co-operate with its global trading partners.
    
The process of European integration has been slow but steady. I often 
wonder what factors helped the Europeans overcome the legacies of a violent 
past. Are there some ingredients in this union that are peculiar to Europe? 
Perhaps the heritage of a Greco-Roman civilisation, the common beliefs and 
the will to defend shared values, helped nurture and cement the pact.
    
Certainly during the cold war, the common perception of a threat from 
communism united Western Europe. Now in the post-cold war era, it is the 
motivation and the determination of Europe to defend its interests as an 
important actor on the international scene.
    
Perhaps, then, the success of the EU teaches us that no monumental 
achievement is possible without patience and perseverance. As Robert 
Schuman put it in 1950, Europe will not be made all at once, or according 
to a single plan. It has taken the EU almost 25 years to attain maturity.
    
This is no small achievement, considering the difficult road traversed. 
Bottlenecks, prejudices, suspicions and national pride were obstacles in 
the path of unity. But they were obstacles that could be overcome.
    
Of particular interest to those of us outside Europe is the process of 
political integration and the development of a joint position on security 
issues. At this point, however, the region has yet to achieve a level of 
synchronisation in foreign policy where the decisions on critical issues 
are taken with the swiftness that they merit.
    
One glaring example of European indecisiveness, for instance, is Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Too many precious lives were lost and principles of 
international law sacrificed in the search for consensus.
    
A greater success has been Europes economic integration. The EUs trade 
with Asia, for example, has received a tremendous boost. Between 1990 and 
1994, European imports from the Asian trading bloc, ASEAN, rose by almost 
80 per cent. European imports from Asia between 1984 and 1994 increased 139 
per cent, while Asian imports of European goods rose by 110 per cent during 
the same period.
    
The recent summit-level meetings attended by Japan, South Korea, China, the 
EU and ASEAN countries, was a good omen for Asia-Europe co-operation.
    
Despite the increase in trade, however, mutual suspicions still run deep in 
relations between European and developing countries.
    
Europeans tend to see developing economies as condoning human rights abuses 
and environmental pollution to undercut competitors abroad. The developing 
countries, on the other hand, view the EU as a fortress Europe. Some 
believe that the European Unions decision to invoke the Social Clause is 
merely protectionism cloaked in the attractive slogans of fighting drug 
trafficking, promoting good governance, preventing terrorism and nuclear 
proliferation, and protecting intellectual property rights.
    
In the case of Pakistan, the unfortunate murder of Iqbal Masih last year 
prompted the European Parliament to pass a resolution on child labour. The 
resolution quoted an international agencys figures on child labour in 
Pakistan that were later denied by that very organisation.
    
These are issues that need dialogue and discussion between Europe and the 
developing world, especially Asia.
    
The same patience and perseverance that went into building the European 
Union is needed now to build an understanding between Asia and Europe. I 
believe both continents are ready to make that commitment as we leave this 
centurys troubled history behind and chart a course toward global 
prosperity.Copyright 1996 Dawn- Creators Syndicate, Inc.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

Pakistan emphatically and decisively beat England in the final Test at the 
Oval in a match which had its element of drama but which ultimately proved 
the overall superiority of the winning side. The series victory by a margin 
of 2-0 in a shortened itinerary was the fifth in a row for Pakistan since 
1984 when it clinched the honours of a home rubber by a lone win at the 
National Stadium.
 
The success of the Pakistan team grows in importance due to the fact that 
77 overs had been lost in the match to inclement weather yet the Pakistan 
squad put to rout the England side struggling, rather unavailingly, to save 
the match.
 
In the earlier part of the last day nobody could have predicted a swing of 
the match towards Pakistan; Englands ship sailed in calm waters with the 
score at 158 for 2 at lunch and enough batting resources left to tackle the 
Pakistan bowling and the situation. However, once Graeme Thorpe, Nasser 
Hussein, who exhibited some stubbornness, and Nick Knight were trapped by 
the vicious spin and the curling flight of Mushtaq Ahmad the writing was 
truly and luridly on the wall. The procession started and there was no 
stopping Pakistan gaining the honours of the Test and the series by an 
impressive margin of 2-0. This despite the fact that many confident leg 
before appeals by the Pakistani bowlers, especially Waqar Younis, were 
spurned by the umpires. And here umpire Kitchen played his part, if rain 
was not coming, to save England from the ignominy of another London defeat 
after the Lords one in the latter part of last month.
 
Mushtaq bowled splendidly and looked dangerous after the lunch break with 
his twisting and crafty spin, disallowing strokes and putting England in 
distress. Though captain Wasim Akram later described him as the best of his 
type in the world and called him superior to the Australian wizard Shane 
Warne any comparison is unjustified and irrelevant for Shane has 
demonstrated his class and calibre in similar situations. Mushtaq proved a 
true match-winner with an unbroken spell of 30 overs in the crucial second 
innings and was uplifted to the level and skill of another great performer, 
Abdul Qadir, whose trickery confounded even the soundest of batsmen. With a 
bulky frame he bowled in the style and manner of the famed spinner of yore, 
Amir Elahi.
 
It is really surprising why young Saqlain Mushtaq was ignored throughout 
the Test series, especially at the Oval after successfully bowling against 
Leicestershire and Essex. One noted that at times Robert Craft, the England 
off-spinner, was quite difficult to be handled. With Saqlain, operating 
from the other end with Mushtaq, Englands ordeal would have magnified. At 
last he has been given a chance in the limited-overs series to show his 
talent. One hopes he does not suffer the indictment of the officials on 
return to make way for Rawalpindis Arshad Khan, whose career haul of two 
wickets with an average of 79.50 can hardly give him a chance in the 
national outfit for the Indo-Pakistan duel for the Sahara Cup in Toronto. 
Besides, in the only appearance in the international limited-overs fixture 
against Sri Lanka at Rawalpindi last October Arshad was wicketless in seven 
overs effort in a match lost by Pakistan.
 
Both the pacers, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, had fiery spells in the 
match, the former in particular reached the milestone of 300 wickets in 70 
Tests. Only Imran Khan is in his company from Pakistan in the 300-club, 
though the former captain played lesser number of Tests (68 to be exact) to 
attain the figures. The two Ws bowled well even in the first innings when 
the strip had become a batting cushion after the rain. It was Wasim who 
settled the issue for Pakistan by crashing through the defences of Croft 
and Mullally, the tail-enders.
 
The series put Waqar again among the most destructive trundlers of the 
present day cricket. He had eight wickets to his credit in the Lords 
success, picked up three wickets at Leeds and had five scalps at the Oval 
to have a wicket aggregate of 16 in the series. Certainly both Wasim and 
Waqar are ready for the assault against India in the neutral setting of 
Canada.
 
While assessing the Oval Test one cannot but laud the brisk and assured 
batting of Saeed Anwar, who deservingly got a century, and the serene way 
in which Salim Malik batted to reach three figures. It was on the whole a 
team effort, as both the captain and tour manager, Yawar Saeed, 
acknowledged after the Oval outcome.
 
In the earlier Tests Inzamams aggressive century at Lords, Saeed Anwars 
crisp batting at the headquarters, hundreds by Ejaz and Moin Khan at the 
drawn Leeds match raised the morale of the team in a country where cricket 
encounters are usually full of controversies.
 
This time even the tabloids refrained from undue attacks on the visiting 
team and the players. The game was played in the best spirit and as 
Englands coach and the captain have admitted the verdict was clinched by 
the better side with all-round capacities.
 
Now that the series have ended in favour of Pakistan the selectors 
(regretfully ousted before completing their tenure) deserve a pat on the 
back for choosing a strong and balanced side, entirely on the form and 
record of the players. The selection of a few youngsters appeared risky on 
paper but even Shadab Kabir showed guts at the important and responsible 
slot of an opener when Aamir Sohail was ruled out to play. Mohammad Akram 
too was a good ally of the senior pacers even though he was not much 
encouraged during the tour.

<a name="wasi">Wasim Akrams distinction</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Shoaih Ahmed

Pakistans Captain and main strike bowler Wasim Akram, (30) became the 
second bowler of this country to take 300 wickets in Test cricket when he 
had Englands Alan Mullally clean bowled on August 26, the last day of the 
third and final Test at the Oval.
 
Wasim Akram who was playing in his 70th Test, is the 11th player to take 
300 wickets, behind record-holder Kapil Dev of India, New Zealands Richard 
Hadlee, Englands Ian Botham, West Indies Lance Gibbs, Courtney Walsh and 
Malcolm Marshall, Pakistans Imran Khan, Australias Dennis Lillee, 
Englands Bob Willis and Freddie Truman. Of these bowlers, ten come in the 
category of quick bowlers, ranging from fast to medium-fast. Only one West 
Indian Gibbs, an off-break bowler was a slow spinner. Wasim is the third 
Asian, after Kapil Dev and Imran Khan to have achieved this feat.
 
Lillee and Hadlee have the highest strike-rate of most wickets per Test in 
excess of five per match, closely followed by Truman and Marshall with jut 
under five wickets per Test.

<a name="once">Pakistan once more a force to be feared</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Peter Deeley

LONDON: Meetings between Pakistan and England tend to bring partisan 
instincts in some sections of the British Press. It was no exception this 
time, even though in Wasim Akram Pakistan had a captain held in almost 
universal respect.
    
Wasim and the tour management played a major role in ensuring that this 
visit went off smoothly. Old skeletons such as ball tampering were rattled 
in the media but this Pakistan side demonstrated that not only are they 
once more a force to be feared in the international game, they were also 
excellent ambassadors for their country.
    
It helped considerably that the opposing captains Wasim and Englands Mike 
Atherton are colleagues in the Lancashire dressing room and were able 
quickly to defuse any potential flash-point.
    
On two occasions, first at Lords and then during the final hours at The 
Oval hints were dropped by a television source that a Pakistani player had 
been seen possibly tampering with the ball. But the evidence was never 
produced on film and so was dismissed out of hand.
    
England came into the series on a high after beating India 1-0 in the first 
Test series of the summer and 2-0 in the one-days that followed.
    
The Indians were poor fare yet and at no time did England match the bowling 
firepower of the Pakistanis and it was in the world class quality of their 
attack that Pakistan were superior throughout.
    
As a journalist who has seen more of Pakistan cricket than any of his 
English counterparts in the past decade, I was struck by the way the side 
had pulled itself together after the disasters of the previous years, the 
Salim Malik allegations involving Australia, the defeat at home by Sri 
Lanka, then in Australia and the World Cup flop against India at Bangalore.
    
It was difficult to imagine how the side could rally for the visit to 
England, yet everything came together in time and in remarkable fashion, 
for which Wasim and senior players like Mushtaq Ahmed must take great 
credit.
    
Wasim himself did not produce the quality of fast bowling of which we all 
know he is capable until the final Test. Then at the death in the last Oval 
innings he was almost unplayable as he managed his 300th wicket.
    
Waqar Younis, on the other hand, appeared to have overcome all past fitness 
problems and was simply too quick and lethal for even experienced England 
batsman. Mushtaq with his variety of spin went from strength to strength 
and was always an example to others in the outfield.
    
Yet for many the player of the series was Saeed Anwar who began the tour 
with a double century and was never anything else but a batsman of 
consummate stroke-playing ability allied to unexpected ferocity. Hopefully 
he will entertain us for many years to come now that he seems to have 
thrown all the virus which once kept him out of the game.
    
Both Wasim and Atherton were of the opinion that this should have been a 
five - Test tour. Quite why Pakistan is bracketed to three Tests is not 
entirely clear though that may partly be due to the Englishmans antipathy 
for people who are different to himself.

<a name="jrcr">Jr cricketers case to be heard by Jamaican court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Sept 3: Pakistan Under-19 cricketer, Zeeshan Pervaiz, accused of 
raping a 36-year-old Jamaican in the West Indies, faces a preliminary 
hearing in a Jamaican court of law on Wednesday morning, Chief Executive of 
the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Majid Khan, said.
    
The case will be put up for preliminary hearing on Wednesday morning in 
which the honourable court will decide if the petition of the complainant 
has to be accepted, Majid, said while speaking from his Lahore residence 
late on Tuesday evening.
    
Majid further revealed that the 18-year-old batsman has been released on 
bail. The bail was asked for by the Jamaican Cricket Association. He is no 
more in the custody of the police.
    
The cricket board official, however, was unsure what will happen on 
Wednesday. It is premature to say at the moment. But it is a very 
sensitive situation. We have absolutely no clue whatsoever what will happen 
if the honourable court accepts the petition of the woman.

Majid emphasised that the outcome of the hearing will not be known till 
late Wednesday night (according to PST) because of the time difference. 
When it would be morning in Jamaica, it will be night in Pakistan. We will 
only know about the whole proceeding of the court early Thursday morning.
    
Majid, who sounded worried and concerned, stated that the Pakistan Cricket 
Board (PCB) was in constant contact with the Jamaican Cricket Association. 
They are extending their full co-operation and besides getting the bail of 
the cricketer, have also hired a team of reputed lawyers who will be 
contesting the case.

<a name="akra">Wasim Akram satisfied with England cricket tour</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Farhana Ayaz

RAWALPINDI, Sept 4: Skipper Wasim Akram termed the England tour as the best 
Pakistan ever had but blamed bad one-day itinerary as one of the reasons 
for losing the series 1-2.
    
The Pakistan captain made these remarks upon return from London at the 
Islamabad airport early Wednesday morning. Amongst the lot which did not 
return were the Karachi-based cricketers. They will be arriving on the 
direct London-Karachi flight on Sept 5, it was learnt.
    
A  satisfied  Wasim Akram gave full credit to the behaviour, determination 
and spirit of each and every individual of the team.  I am very glad the 
way each and every player backed each other up, and especially the way they 
co-operated with me throughout the tour. The discipline on and off the 
field was perfect. I had no problem whatsoever.
    
Wasim further termed the recently-concluded tour as the best ever any 
Pakistan team had in England. We did not have any problems which previous 
sides had. No scandals, no bad Press, nothing went wrong amongst the two 
teams. Everybody played good positive cricket, the captain said, adding 
that the English players also behaved in a very friendly way during the 
tour.
    
Pakistan won the three-Test series 2-0 but lost the three one-day series by 
1-2.
    
Commenting on the one-day loss the captain blamed  the itinerary which was 
fixed without break between the one-day games. My team was totally drained 
at the end of the Test series where every one tried to give his best and we 
succeeded, Wasim said.
    
However, the skipper said that `being drained out was no excuse for the 
loss but nevertheless he said this was the case. We should have had one 
day break during one-day games.
    
Besides, Wasim maintained that three of the top players were injured before 
the one-day series which included Saqlain Mushtaq, Inzamamul Haq and 
Mushtaq Ahmed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Sept 4: The Pakistan cricket team for the Sahara Cup and the 
quadrangular tournament in Nairobi, Kenya, has been selected, sources close 
to the National Selection Committee, said on Wednesday.
    
Sources, requesting not to be identified, stated that the selection process 
was completed in the last week of the England tour.
    
They stated that Chairman of Selectors, Salim Altaf, had arrived in England 
before the first one-day game while member Selection Committee, Zaheer 
Abbas, landed there before the second one-dayer.
    
Nasimul Ghani (third selector) and co-opted members Wasim Akram and Mushtaq 
Mohammad were already in England.
    
Sources say the team for the two coming tournaments was decided after the 
third one-day international which Pakistan won by two wickets.
    
Sources disclosed that wicketkeeper Rashid Latif was one of the five 
glaring omissions from the 17-member team that undertook a 72-day tour of 
England. Rashid Latif, it may be recalled, steered Pakistan to victory 
single-handedly in the final one-day after the middle-order had collapsed.
    
The other notable absentee is medium-pacer Shahid Nazir who impressed with 
his pace, line and length in the final fixture. Shahid finished with 
figures of 10-0-47-2.
    
The other three players who have reportedly been left out are Asif Mujtaba, 
Ataur Rahman and Shahid Anwer.
    
To complete the 14-player team, the selectors have thrown their weight 
behind Salim Elahi, the opener, who slammed a century on his one-day 
international debut against world champions Sri Lanka at Gujranwala but was 
later a failure in other outings, and Islamabads talented allrounder Azher 
Mahmood.
    
However, question mark is still hangs over the fitness of Inzamamul Haq, 
who is nursing a bad knee, and paceman Mohammad Akram, who has pulled a 
side muscle under the rib-cage.
    
The 14-member team for the two tours( as revealed by sources)are:
    
Wasim Akram (captain), Aamir Sohail (vice-captain), Saeed Anwar, Salim 
Elahi, Shadab Kabir, Inzamamul Haq, Ijaz Ahmad, Salim Malik, Moin Khan 
(wicketkeeper), Waqar Younis, Azhar Mahmood, Mohammad Akram, Mushtaq Ahmad 
and Saqlain Mushtaq.
