-------------------------------------------------------------------
Izharul Hasan Burney

KARACHI: The 15th amendment bill tabled by the government and the 
accountability bill moved by the opposition in the National Assembly seem 
to be a hotchpotch of new and old ideas, conflicting and overlapping 
provisions, and lacking in vital areas of legislative reforms to plug all 
holes of corruption, and may need refining and extensive rewriting, 
analysts said in their initial reaction.
    
They reflect the mood of the government and the opposition in the prevalent 
political scenario and mounting pressure against growing corruption both 
from within and outside the country, they said and hoped that the needful 
will be done by the NA select committee in the spirit of the Constitution 
through detailed deliberations, public debate and a national consensus.
    
A good beginning has been made. The ruling party and the opposition have 
committed themselves to work together and also take along the minor 
parliamentary groups in the House.
    
However, it will be desirable to similarly associate the other political 
factions (not represented in the House), Pakistan Bar Council, various 
Bars, etc., to undertake studies at their own end and forward 
reports/recommendations to the select committee for its consideration, they 
said.
    
To begin with, analysts wondered if the parliamentarians were the ideal 
people to perform the kind of job normally associated with crime 
investigation and punishment. 
   
Their basic responsibility (also training and profession) is to make the 
laws and oversee and monitor the work of various government 
agencies/institutions.
    
The accountability mechanism could, therefore, best be divided into two 
main parts: the legislative reforms, and crime investigation.
    
A crime investigation commission answerable only to the parliament and the 
president would best serve this purpose. 
   
It should be on the pattern of the Federal Ombudsman, the Election 
Commission, the Council of Islamic Ideology, etc., with a full-fledged 
permanent secretariat staffed with highly skilled professionals to 
investigate and prove before special courts the most intricate financial, 
political, administrative and such other cases falling within the purview 
of the proposed bill.
    
On its part, the select committee may later convert itself into 
legislative reforms committee and take up a review and recasting of all 
the defective laws or those lacking in any respect and bring them in 
conformity with the letter and spirit of the Constitution and to make them 
meaningful and effective, analysts said.
    
For example, the Political Parties Act provides for a defection clause but 
for the last over three decades the legislature has been unable to define 
what constitutes defection with the result that horse-trading is rampant 
and democratic values and parliamentary practices are being trampled with 
impunity.
    
This deficiency in law was pointed out by superior judiciary more than 
once. The two caretaker prime ministers, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi and Moeen 
Qureshi, during their tenure promulgated ordinances to meet this deficiency 
but the ordinances were allowed to lapse when the elected governments took 
over.
    
Governments would not have toppled but for this deficiency, and MNAs and 
MPAs would not have minted gold but for this lacunae. Accountability would 
be meaningless without this legislative reform, analysts pointed out.
    
Likewise, there were a set of election laws inconsistent with the spirit of 
the Constitution.
    
For example, the Senators, MNAs and MPAs are required to furnish annual 
statements of assets. 
   
However, there is no provision of a punitive clause if the legislators fail 
to do so and therefore may ignore it with contempt. Besides, the defective 
law makes these declarations a confidential document. Why? Is it not in 
public interest to make all such information transparent? analysts asked.
    
And why should the people at large be debarred from seeking 
disqualification of a legislator for any wrong act or misdeed during his 
tenure? they added.
    
In fact, the house committee should look into every piece of legislation or 
resolution passed by the House conferring exemptions in taxes, or 
remissions, etc., as well as conferment of any special financial benefits 
to the legislators, e.g. allotment of plots, tax-exemptions for salaries 
and perquisites, etc.
    
In the past, such malpractices have taken place in respect of 
controversial land allotments; and in the eighties the legislators had 
grabbed the right to sanction two telephone connections each month in any 
part of the country  a privilege which at that particular time meant a 
guaranteed monthly income of at least Rs100,000 for two telephone 
connections in the peak-demand localities of Clifton and Defence Housing 
Authority.
    
Indeed, there are dozens of such laws and resolutions through which the 
legislators grabbed monetary benefits and thus misused the august forum 
where they should have concentrated on matters of national and public 
interest only.
    
Similarly, the statute book is filled with provisos conferring full power 
on competent authority to indulge in unethical practices. These too would 
need to be scrapped from the statute books, the analysts said, adding that 
the accountability process cannot afford to ignore such reckless and 
immoral exercise of the discretionary powers.
    
Referring to the overlapping provisions of the amendment bill the analysts 
particularly referred to the existing provision in the Constitution about 
the Supreme Judicial Council.
    
This is a comprehensive provision, and in the past also the Supreme 
Judicial Council has not failed to act judiciously. At this very stage, the 
Supreme Court of Pakistan is seized of a matter in which the desirability 
of the detailed working of the STC has also been highlighted.
    
Let the honourable courts devise their own ways and set precedents of 
highest integrity, the analysts said, adding that the nation had full faith 
in the judiciary which cannot be left to the mercy of a handful of 15 per 
cent legislators of doubtful integrity.
    
In a nutshell, the country needs an era of rule of justice and those 
defending the outdated concept of rule of (misconstrued) law should find 
no place in the 21st century Pakistan, they concluded.

<a name="reli">Religious schools: who controls what they teach?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Jamal

You can hardly miss seeing them. Some in green turbans and others in white 
caps, bearded young faces probing for a direction. These students of 
religious seminaries or madaris are a part of our daily life. What does the 
future hold for them? What do they mean for the future?

LAHORE, Oct 27: Madaris have registered a phenomenal growth since the late 
1970s. An official report prepared by intelligence agencies last year shows 
that their number in the country has risen to 8,000 from a mere 868 in 
1975. Many madaris were set up before independence in 1947, but very few 
news ones were established till 1977, the year Gen. Ziaul Haq imposed 
martial law in the country.

Thousands of madaris sprang up in the late 1970s and the early 1980s when 
Gen. Zia started pampering and patronising religious groups to create a 
constituency for himself. The communist intervention in Afghanistan further 
bolstered these groups as huge funds from the West started to pour in to 
stop the communist advance, with many Arab governments also opening their 
coffers in the name of jihad. For some Arab states, the Iranian revolution 
also posed a threat and needed to be contained.

These madaris were given a boost by Gen. Zia when he compelled the 
University Grants Commission to recognise the Wifaqs or federations, which 
act as degree-awarding and curriculum designing and regulating institutions 
for madaris affiliated with them, of different sects and treat their 
degrees as equivalent to M.A. Arabic/Islamiyat in 1980. He also ordered 
recruitment of graduates of these madaris as Islamiyat/Arabic teachers in 
BPS-9 in middle and primary schools.

EXPLOSIVE: At present 2,512 registered madaris are located in the Punjab 
alone. Statistics show that most madaris  1,619  are situated in southern 
Punjab which has an explosive combination of a strong feudal hold, rampant 
poverty and minimal educational facilities. But they are also thriving in 
the urban areas. It is preferable to establish madaris in cities because 
of easy availability of modern facilities, Jamia Naeemias Dr Muhammad 
Sarfraz says.

It is surprising that the madaris want to use modern inventions, but 
usually offer outdated theological courses. Their students are taught fiqh 
(interpretation of Islam), hadith (sayings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), 
tafseer (commentary on the Holy Quran), philosophy, history, Islamic 
jurisprudence, etc. The madaris claim to be inheritors of the traditional 
madaris of the early Muslim period, saying that their objective is to 
produce Aalim-i-Deen (experts in religion). But none of them teaches 
science, arithmetic, algebra, geometry or other disciplines relevant to the 
needs of society.

Academics point out that the education imparted at the old, traditional 
madaris was relevant to the needs of their people and society and they 
produced scientists who are still considered pioneers of modern science. 
The education imparted in our madaris has no relevance to the life of the 
people or society. They are producing only recruits for religious 
organisations which run these madaris, says a Punjab University teacher.

COURSES: Education, or deeni taleem, starts at the madaris with Hifz-o-
Manazra (memorising the Quran). It is followed by Tajweed-o-Qirat 
(recitation of the Quran). Students with middle education are admitted to 
an eight-year Dars-i-Nizami course which is the main degree offered by the 
most madaris. The Dars-i-Nizami course starts with Saanavi-a-Aama 
(matriculation), Darja-i-Mutawast (intermediate), Darja-i-Aalia 
(graduation) and Darja-i-Aalmia (MA Arabic/Islamiyat). They also offer 
specialised courses in hadith, fiqh and other disciplines to the holders of 
the Darja-i-Aalmia degree.

The wifaqs of each sect design curricula and syllabi for their affiliated 
institutions, conduct their examinations and award certificates and 
degrees. The wifaqs are free to change their courses and books without 
seeking permission from the UGC which has little control over them save for 
giving legitimacy to their degrees at the state level.

The age of the madaris students ranges on average between five and 18 
years. They attract students because of the generally depressed economic 
condition of the people, the abysmal lack of educational facilities and the 
official patronage given to them in the recent past. Free hostel 
accommodation, food, clothing and payment of Rs 100 to Rs 200 per month per 
student as scholarship is obviously a major attraction, and in their own 
way the madaris are at least contributing to literacy. There are about 
218,939 students enrolled at the madaris in the Punjab. About 15-20 per 
cent of them are girls. Most students come from poor families.

Some 100,588 students are enrolled at the madaris affiliated with the 
Wifaqul Madaris Arabia and the Rabitaul Madaris Islamia Arabi of the 
Deobandi sect and the Jamaat-i-Islami, 95,190 with the Tanzeemul Madaris 
Arabiya of the Barelvi sect, 18,880 with the Wifaqul Sulfiya Arabiya of the 
Ahle-Hadith sect and 2,022 with the Wifaqul Shia Arabiya of the Shia sect.

One major reason for the mushroom growth of the madaris is said to be their 
ability to raise huge funds through Zakat funds since Gen. Zias period, 
private donations and financial assistance from some Muslim states.

According to officials, 36 per cent of these institutions have been 
receiving Rs 100 million from Zakat funds while the rest of them receive 
donations from Pakistanis settled abroad or some Arab governments. An Auqaf 
Department official says 906 madaris receive funds from Saudi Arabia, Iran, 
Iraq, Kuwait, Egypt, Lebanon and Syria. Some are funded by foreign 
governments and others by well-off individuals or religious organisations. 
These funds have turned some of those associated with the madaris concerned 
into big property owners. It is believed that the vested interest developed 
by them is a factor in the promotion of sectarian violence.

A police official says the funds and accounts of these madaris are never 
audited though under the Charitable Funds Act 1953 they are bound to submit 
the annual audit reports of their accounts to the government.

The charge of foreign funding is denied by the madaris, but some of them 
privately accuse rival sects of receiving funds from foreign governments 
sympathetic to them.

SECTARIAN LINK: Few madaris are overtly sectarian, but they are often 
blamed for sectarian teachings and killings. Most madaris impart sectarian 
teachings orally. Concepts like jihad against kafirs (non-believers) who 
also include followers of other sects are openly preached. They have 
objectionable printed material which is provided to those who are able to 
win the trust of their instructors, says a police official who has closely 
monitored the working of these madaris.

At least 746 madaris in the Punjab are said to have strong sectarian links. 
They provide space for clandestine meetings where planning is done to 
carry out violent acts, says the official. Police have strong evidence 
that the recent mass killings in Mailsi and Multan and the murder of the 
commissioner of Sargodha were planned at some madaris. Besides creating 
hard-core activists for different religious organisations, these madaris 
also serve as nurseries for providing recruits and an audience for them, 
says the official.

He says some madaris are also involved in providing military training to 
their students. But most of them are located either in the NWFP or the Azad 
Kashmir, with only a few in the Punjab. The government is well aware of 
this, but has not taken any action because of political expediencies, the 
official maintains.

The government has taken a few steps here and there to bring the activities 
of the madaris under its control, but to no avail. It has banned Egyptian 
and Algerian students from seeking admission to the madaris to stop 
penetration of foreigners. The procedure to procure zakat has been made 
more elaborate and the Foreign Office has made it compulsory for foreign 
students and madaris to obtain a no-objection certificate from it before 
admitting any foreigner. It has put an end to the earlier practice by 
police of issuing a stay permit for foreign students on their own. 
However, says an official, some madaris continue to admit foreigners 
without authorisation.

Their graduates are employed as qaris and khateebs at the Auqaf mosques or 
as Arabic/Islamiyat teachers at primary and middle schools. But most remain 
unemployed. A Home Department official says graduates of the madaris do not 
fit into normal society or life because of their orthodox views and 
qualifications which have no relevance to the existing job market. So some 
of them try to mould society according to their own notions in reaction and 
indulge in sectarian violence in the name of religion. Since they have an 
ideology to support their acts they prove more dangerous than common 
criminals.

DENIAL: Madaris deny the charges of sectarianism and accuse the government 
of thinking up excuses to demolish the system of deeni taleem under 
pressure from the donor agencies and the West. Dr Muhammad Sarfraz says the 
government itself plants personnel of secret agencies in some madaris to 
train people for the liberation of Kashmir or the fight in Afghanistan. 
And when they are no longer needed, the government points to these madaris 
to tarnish our image, he says. He says sectarian organisations like the 
Sipah-i-Sahaba or the Sipah-i-Muhammad Pakistan cannot operate without the 
government or secret agencies assisting them. None of them has any link 
with the madaris, he says.

Jamia Ashrafias Muhammad Akram says while some terrorists may use the 
madaris in the garb of students for their motives, they can use any place 
for that matter. According to him, most students come from poor families 
and cannot even think of obtaining a Kalashnikov. The people who want to 
eliminate the madaris have unleashed a propaganda to malign us, he says.

Intelligence agencies have once again started collecting information about 
the madaris, but officials consider it a futile exercise in the absence of 
effective follow-up action. It does not matter whether you have up-to-date 
information if you do not take action, says a police official.

Officials point out that laws exist to disband madaris found involved in 
acts detrimental to the security of the state. The government lacks the 
political will to tackle the issue and feels helpless in the face of the 
supposed street power of religious groups. It has done little to bring the 
madaris under its discipline, says an official.

In 1995 the government decided to regulate and prescribe a uniform syllabus 
for the madaris, audit their accounts, register them with provincial 
Education Departments and Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education. 
However, none of these decisions has so far been implemented.

Officials believe that the activities of the madaris can be harnessed to a 
large extent by linking them with the countrys education system and 
extending the public school network to provide free education and 
vocational training to remoter areas. Their curricula and syllabi must be 
formulated by the Education Department, says an Auqaf Department official. 
Parents should be bound to send their children to ordinary schools even if 
they want them to obtain religious education.

The official says it requires the political authority to take firm action. 
As long as the government continues to hobnob with religious groups or 
fear their street power, these madaris will continue to thrive.

<a name="poli">Police had orders not to lay hands on Mir: PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

RAWALPINDI, Oct 25: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto disclosed here on Friday 
that there were clear instructions to the Sindh Police from the federal and 
the provincial government that Mir Murtaza Bhutto should not be intercepted 
or checked.
    
She was addressing a condolence meeting on the Chehlum of Mir Murtaza 
Bhutto here at Liaquat Bagh.
    
Ms Bhutto said they had also been instructed not to lay hands on Mirs 
guards, wanted by the police, in his presence. She pointed out that Murtaza 
had visited some police stations a few days before his death, and there the 
police did not arrest any of his guards just because of the fact that they 
had been so instructed.
    
The prime minister said a team of British experts was coming to Pakistan to 
investigate the murder of Mir Murtaza Bhutto. She confirmed that the 
policemen involved in the murder have already been arrested.

Why is it so that only the member of Bhutto family are being killed, she 
said. During the last 18 years, she said, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his two 
sons were killed.

<a name="fisc">Fiscal measures devoid of any vision: Mahbub </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 24: Dr Mahbub-ul-Haq has termed the recent fiscal measures 
of the government cosmetic financial tinkering bereft of any economic 
vision and suggested that a permanent body of independent economist should 
be set up to help save the country from economic disaster.
    
In a statement issued on Tuesday the former finance minister advised the 
government to set up a council of economic advisers inviting independent 
economist of the country to offer their candid analysis to the government 
on a regular basis to save the economy from the abyss in which it is about 
to fall.
    
Criticising the mini-budget of Rs40 billion announced by the government on 
Tuesday, he said it was a desperate attempt and no substitute for real 
reforms which were really needed to revive the economy and to benefit the 
poor people of Pakistan.
    
Many of the announced measures, he said, would prove counterproductive for 
the real economy. A cut of Rs20 billion in an already modest development 
budget would unbalance the prospects for future growth. Rising energy 
prices would compromise the competitiveness of the very exports that the 
government wished to encourage through rupees devaluation. A 30 per cent 
fall in the exchange value of the rupee since last year has already created 
domestic inflation and stagnation, without increasing exports.
    
The past experience, he said, had shown that devaluation without basic 
measures to revive agricultural and industrial production was totally 
useless.

<a name="paki">Pakistan faces uphill task in getting UN body seat</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, Oct 30: Pakistan faces an uphill task in its bid to seek 
another term in the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) 
when the UN General Assembly meets on Thursday to elect 18 new members for 
the 54-member economic body.
    
Of the 18 members to be elected in the ECOSOC, three seats are reserved for 
the Asian continent for which there are six candidates  Pakistan, Japan, 
Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Syria and Sri-Lanka. Of the six candidates, 
Pakistan, Japan and Indonesia are seeking re-election, the other three, 
Korea, Sri Lanka and Syria are new candidates.
    
Most diplomats at the United Nations, including Pakistani officials, 
concede that Japan and Republic of Korea are a virtual shoe-in for two of 
the three seats. The reasons are essentially economic, since these two 
nations are also aid-giving countries. They have considerable clout among 
the ECOSOC membership.
    
Pakistan, which is seeking re-election, has split support amongst the SAARC 
nations since, Sri Lanka is also contesting the seat against Pakistan. The 
Non-Aligned Movements caucus has decided not to endorse a candidate while 
the Arab group obviously supports Syrias candidacy.
    
Moreover, Pakistans support among the Asian nations has eroded radically, 
after it used all its clout to claim one of the 21 vice-presidential seats 
in the General Assembly and contesting against Arab states.

Indians who are still nursing the wounds of their abysmal defeat at the 
hands of Japanese in their bid for a seat in the Security Council would 
like nothing better to see Pakistan lose in the ECOSOC.

For Pakistan losing a seat on the Economic and Social Council would be a 
bigger loss than its glee at winning one of the 21 vice-presidency slots in 
the General Assembly. While the UNGAs vice-presidency is purely ceremonial 
post, but to be one of the board members of economic arm of the world body 
is pivotal.

<a name="pity">Pity the traveller coming out of Jinnah Terminal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 27: If you are a passenger whos just come out of the 
arrivals lounge at Quaid-i-Azam International Airport, you can definitely 
expect to be mobbed by sleazy cab-drivers, private loaders and touts the 
moment you come out.
    
If you are coming out of the international arrivals lounge and are 
travelling alone, either male or female, then the situation can get even 
worse.
    
On October 1, the sub-divisional magistrate of the jurisdiction which 
covers Jinnah Terminal, under section 144 Cr. Pc. banned for two months 
unauthorised money-changers, private loaders, taxi drivers and touts at the 
airport.
    
A visit to the airport on Sunday showed that this measure, albeit a well
intentioned one is hardly being enforced properly.
    
Over a period of an hour on Sunday afternoon, in which at least seven 
domestic flights and two international flights arrived at the airport, this 
reporter saw at least two incidents in which the recently-arrived air-
travellers were about to come to blows with either a tout, a sleazy man 
insisting on grabbing his trolley and helping carry his luggage or with a 
taxi-driver insisting on taking him as a passenger (read fleecing him).
    
There were approximately fifty such men literally prowling the spaces in 
front of the domestic and international arrival lounges switching back and 
forth between the two depending on where the flight was coming.
    
The first case of harassment by these men claiming to be private loaders, 
taxi drivers or touts happened as a Lufthansa flight from Kathmandu arrived 
around 1 pm.
    
A (presumably) European traveller came out of the arrivals lounge wearing a 
blazer and jeans, with her suitcases on a trolley. As soon as she came out, 
she was literally swamped by these men.
    
The situation became extreme as the language gap (most of these men though 
speak some broken English phrases) seemed to make them more anxious in 
getting their message across.
    
The woman literally started swinging her arms wildly to throw back the 
touts, the men claiming to be private loaders, the taxi drivers.
    
Eventually, close to tears, one of the guards on duty and a person standing 
close by intervened and rescued the traveller  hardly a welcome for the 
foreign traveller on a first visit here, and that too at the countrys 
premier airport and commercial and financial capital.
    
However, in less extreme cases, the guards apart from the periodic waving 
of their stick at these men (which forces them back literally for not a few 
minutes at the most) tolerate their presence.
    
The second incident was of a single male, who was well-dressed and looked 
Pakistani. The minute he came out two persons from either side placed their 
hands on his trolley and insisted on performing porter duties.
    
It was a funny sight because both men started arguing with each other on 
who would eventually become porter. The well-dressed traveller, however, 
had not even given the slightest indication that he wanted any help with 
his luggage.
    
After a minute or two, in total opposition to his well-heeled image, but 
acting out of frustration (probably on being in such undesirable company 
the moment he stepped out), the man let loose some aptly-selected 
profanities in the mother tongue, all the while readying his fist and 
directing it at one of the men.
    
Luckily, just then the mans (presumably) driver showed up on the scene and 
the tension ended.
    
Far from hilarious, such scenes are common because the SDMs own orders are 
not enforced and men who insist on helping you with your luggage or 
transport, sleazy taxi drivers and touts are permitted easy access within 
the premises of the premier airport of the country.

Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Oct 26: Police on Sunday arrested a staff member of the Indian 
embassy on the charges of espionage. After detaining him for five hours in 
the Aabpara police station, police handed him over to an Indian embassy 
representative. The official has been ordered to leave Pakistan within a 
week.
    
A.B Wahi, a staffer of the Indian embassy was arrested when he was 
allegedly exchanging some sensitive information with a Pakistani contact, 
Mohammed Latif. After his arrest at 11 am, he was brought to Aabpara police 
station.
    
According to police, the Indian official had developed a Pakistani contact 
in the last three months and was exchanging sensitive information with him. 
The police stated that the Indian embassy staffer during interrogation 
divulged that he was a RAW agent and was operating in Pakistan under the 
cover of the Indian embassy.

PAKISTAN DIPLOMAT: India on Saturday ordered the expulsion of a Pakistani 
diplomat whom police had earlier detained and accused of acquiring secret 
documents on the navy from an Indian contact, says Reuter quoting a 
government official.
    
An Indian police spokesman said the diplomat, named as Hafiz Ahmed Khosa, 
had been detained on Friday after he was alleged to have accepted the 
secret documents on the southern naval command from an Indian student. The 
student, named as Ravinder Kumar, was arrested under Indias official 
secrets laws.

<a name="pubi">Public debt constitutes 88% of GDP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Oct 24: Pakistans total national debt stood at Rs 1912.9 billion 
or 88 per cent of its GDP at the end of fiscal year 1995-96 and debt 
servicing accounted for 63.2 per cent of its total tax receipts or 46.3 per 
cent of the current expenditures of 1995-96.
    
According to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) annual report released here 
on Thursday, the domestic debt of the country stood at Rs 908.9 billion or 
41.8 per cent of its GDP while the external debt amounted to Rs 1004.0 
billion ($28.60 billion) or 46.2 per cent of the GDP at end-June 1996.
    
The report attributes the accumulation of such a large public debt to huge 
budget deficits in the past several years. This together with the rising 
rates of return on domestic debt and a declining share of long-term soft 
loans from external sources has led to a sharp increase in interest 
payments, the report says.

DOMESTIC DEBT: The report says that the domestic debt at end-June 1996 rose 
by Rs 100.3 billion or 13.8 per cent to Rs 908.9 billion from Rs 798.6 
billion recorded a year ago. It says that the floating debt registered a 
substantial rise during 1995-96 mainly for cash balance replenishment 
adding that floating debt accounted for 39.8 per cent of the total domestic 
debt during the last fiscal year.

EXTERNAL DEBT: Financing of large current account deficit over the years 
led to sharp increase in the size of external debt together with a 
relatively low level of reserves, the report notes. It reveals that 
Pakistans total external debt rose by $1.53 billion to $28.60 billion at 
end-June 1996 from $27.07 billion at end-June 1995.

<a name="curr">Current account deficit widens to all-time high </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 24: The balance of trade widened to all time high level during 
fiscal year 1995-96, and the country had to suffer a huge current account 
deficit of $4.2 billion which had to be financed by a larger than 
programmed capital account surplus. The adverse balance of payments 
position was because of decline in exports which turned out to be one-half 
of the target of 14 per cent and significantly higher imports at 16.2 per 
cent against the target of 10.6 per cent set for the entire year.
    
These facts feature conspicuously in the Annual Report of State Bank of 
Pakistan for the fiscal year 1995-96 which was released here on Thursday. 
  
The Report frankly admits that the balance of payments targets for the year 
as a whole could not be achieved, when exports increased by only 7 per cent 
in the year as a whole, while import growth amounted to 16.2 per cent, and 
workers remittances declined by 21.7 per cent.
    
As a result of these developments the SBP Report says the current account 
deficit widened to 6.6 per cent of Gross Domestic Produce (GDP) compared 
with 3.6 per cent in 1994-95 and the target of 4.4 per cent for the year.

With the exception of 1948, when the country managed to have favourable 
balance of trade, year after year the external trade has witnessed varying 
degree of deficit. During 1991-92 the imbalance was to the tune of $2.297 
billion, in 1992-93 it was $3.111 billion, 1993-94 the external trade 
deficit was $1.725 billion and in 1994-95 the deficit was $2.227 billion.

<a name="thea">The anatomy of Pakistans crises</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
S.M. Naseem

ALTHOUGH in the short half-century since its birth Pakistan has faced 
numerous crises, its present predicament, is perhaps one of the most 
serious and complex. It is the result of a confluence of four major 
elements which have persistently featured in most of our national crises. 
   
The first, which is the focus of unending speculation in the newspapers is 
the crisis in the political arena, which has dominated public discussion, 
is of short- and medium-term nature and recurs periodically. It is often 
amenable to solution through temporary adjustments or compromises which an 
ingenuous citizenry fatuously accepts with an air of inevitability.
    
The political crisis is often viewed as a game of musical chairs of the 
elite, played by the elite, for the elite by those outside its pale. It is 
totally irrelevant to the life of the common man. The essential need in 
this regard, therefore, is to make the political process closer to the life 
of the people. It is, however, difficult to achieve this without more 
fundamental changes in the economic and social fields.
    
The second is the crisis of economic management, the current focus of which 
is the strained relationship with the IMF. The economic crisis being faced 
by the country has wider dimensions. However, our economic management 
establishment is geared mainly to dealing with the short-term issues. The 
result of such a perverse penchant for transient economic issues, often 
forced by the overarching concern to stay in power and to please the 
foreign donors, is often an accumulating neglect of fundamental problems 
and the constant deferring of their solutions, which in turn make the 
incidence of economic crisis more frequent.
    
Although Pakistans policy makers have never had a far-sighted vision of 
the way the economy was headed, in recent years this capacity has fast 
eroded whatever of it there was and the task of economic management has 
been effectively handed over to those donor agencies who frequently come to 
the rescue of the economy from its periodic lapses towards retrogression.
    
The oft-maligned Harvard Advisory Group in the Planning Commission of the 
1960s, which is sometimes blamed for laying the foundation of an iniquitous 
economic system, at least had the saving grace of playing a catalytic role 
in building a sound infrastructure of economic management and research. 
Unfortunately, that infrastructure fell into increasing disuse due to a 
number of factors.

Deteriorating capability
    
The more recent deterioration in Pakistans indigenous domestic economic 
management capability is also linked with the decreasing importance of 
state intervention in economic affairs and the role of the IMF and the 
World Bank, in rendering economic advice mainly related to the structural 
adjustment programmes, without developing a counter-balancing and credible 
indigenous expertise to vet and critically evaluate such advice. 
    
The Government has adopted the line of least resistance by relying on 
bureaucrats, rather than on its own economists and other technical experts, 
to interlocute with international donor agencies on policy issues.
    
A redeeming feature of the developments in the 1990s has been the granting 
of a certain degree of autonomy to the countrys central bank. However, 
apart from the occasional independence shown by its governor, who for the 
first time in its history, is a well-trained economist as well as an 
experienced central banker, the State Bank of Pakistan has contributed 
little to promote itself as an independent centre of research and analysis 
as an aid to informed economic policy making.
    
It is essential also that the Bank should display its independence  in the 
limited extent to which it is possible to do so  not only from the 
pressures of the government in Islamabad, but also from international 
financial institutions based in Washington whose perceptions and priorities 
may not always coincide with Pakistans national interests.
    
While it is unfair to blame the present governor for being necessarily 
biased in favour of the latter because of his past employment with the IMF, 
it becomes even more necessary for him to mobilise the plentiful resources 
of the Bank to vigorously promote policy-oriented research on long-term 
economic issues not only within the Bank, but also in other major national 
institutions of research and learning.
    
The third is the crisis of social and economic structure, which has been 
highlighted by loan default scandal. The heart of the matter concerning 
most major Pakistani crises, including the present one, is the deepening 
dissonance in the countrys economic and social structure.
    
The economic changes brought about by the neo-liberalist reforms in the 
past five years or so have been undertaken piece-meal and in an 
unimaginative and shoddy manner, getting the worst of both worlds of a 
controlled economy and unfettered capitalism.
    
This has exacerbated the tensions that have existed in the Pakistani 
economy since the 1960s between growth and distribution, by slowing the 
pace of the former and widening the gap in the latter. Whatever trickle-
down effect may have existed in the past strategy has evaporated in the 
opposite direction, scalding those at the bottom and irritating those at 
the top.

Feudal stranglehold
    
The stranglehold of feudalism remains unmitigated, while the hothouse plant 
of capitalism has failed to come of age (despite or perhaps, because of, 
decades of infant industry protection) and provide the necessary breathing 
space for the impoverished rural and urban classes.
    
Under the pressure of the IMF, the tax net may be widened to include 
agriculture to give some semblance of horizontal equity in taxation. 
However, it is most unlikely to make any significant dent on the power of 
the landed elite or loosen their grip on the countrys polity.
    
Unlike East Asia in the post-war world, the foreign powers, despite their 
considerable influence on the policies of our country, are unlikely to be 
of much assistance in getting rid of the parasitic feudal class through 
land reforms or other radical measures.
    
The fourth, and perhaps most important, is the crisis in the sphere of 
education, which covers a very large range of issues. The educational 
system in Pakistan is in an increasing state of disintegration and chaos, 
reflecting the deterioration in the system of governance in general, the 
paucity of resources under structural adjustment and the polarisation of 
the society into those whose children can afford expensive private 
education and those whose children are prematurely forced to join the work 
force.
    
This schism, based on various factors, is steadily becoming wider with the 
mushrooming of private educational institutions at all levels, catering 
mainly to the affluent classes. It has been further exacerbated by 
haphazard attempts to privatise state-funded universities by poorly 
designed self-financing and other revenue raising schemes without any 
regard to its impact on educational standards, access to education by 
different socio-economic classes and other issues both of equity and 
efficiency.
    
Despite the rhetoric to extol the virtues of education and the status of 
the teacher and the scholar in society, very little is being done to give 
education the national priority it deserves.
    
The teacher and the scholar are, in fact, given the lowliest status in the 
community and they receive the most meagre rewards and amenities for their 
services. While the status of women is often cited as the single most 
inhibitive factor in Pakistans human development, the low esteem to 
teachers and low public expenditures on education cant rank too far 
behind.
    
It is, therefore, no surprise that the profession is unable to attract, 
much less retain, the best minds in the country on a sustained basis. Those 
who remain in the profession are also often sucked into the vortex of greed 
and corruption that has plagued the rest of the society.
    
The steady deterioration of higher education, the quality of which has 
declined sharply during the last two decades, is a cause for increasing 
concern. Centres of higher learning are gradually losing the well-trained 
and qualified staff through the process of internal and external brain 
drain.
    
The salary structures of university teachers have become hopelessly 
unattractive, compared to other opportunities available to them outside the 
conductional system. In addition, the state universities are managed in a 
bureaucratic manner which kills the spirit of freedom of thought, 
expression and research which are the hallmark of a university.
    
The recent incidents in the most prestigious universities, the University 
of Karachi and Quaid-i-Azam University, in which teachers have been denied 
the right to express in public their views even in their own fields of 
specialisation, are the most well-known examples. One shudders to imagine 
the academic atmosphere that obtains in the lesser known universities and 
colleges, where heads of institutions lord over their teachers in the 
feudal tradition that reigns supreme.
    
To reduce the public expenditure on education, the government has 
encouraged the growth of private educational institutions, especially in 
professional fields. While it can be considered a welcome development for 
ensuring the supply of high quality professionals, which our resource-
starved public institutions are unable to produce, it has created serious 
questions of equity and has generated complacency about the general 
standards of education.
    
Increased access to education is one of the few options available in 
Pakistan to improve social mobility and to break the logjam of increasing 
concentration of income and wealth. At present there is no effective 
regulatory mechanism to oversee the operations of the private sector 
educational institutions in regard to the relevant public interest issues, 
including those of the recruitment and salary structures of the teachers.
    
As a result, the rampant growth of the recruitment and salary structures of 
the teachers. As a result, the rampant growth of private educational 
institutions making it perhaps one of the few high growth industries is 
contributing to the increase in the inequality of opportunity that is 
already a serious social problem.

Reordering priorities
    
It is distressful that the ordering of these various constituents of our 
national crises in the current public debates is related inversely to their 
intrinsic importance for public welfare. If the nation means serious 
business it must get its priorities right, with education heading the list. 
The undertaking of a quick redressal of the social and economic imbalances 
in the employment and export-oriented development which would provide the 
needed impetus to broad-based economic growth should rank next in 
importance.
    
The current obsession with short-term structural adjustments needed to 
support the unsustainable levels of private and public expenditures 
involving only the upper fifth of the population will have to give way to a 
much broader concern for an economy which provides opportunities for growth 
and upward economic and social mobility to the remaining four fifth of the 
population.
    
Similarly, the preoccupation with catching the 250 loan defaulters or 
sacking a few hundred corrupt bureaucrats or disqualifying a few scores of 
dishonest politicians, like the earlier futile exercises in expurgating 22 
families and 303 officials, are unlikely to achieve much except a glare of 
titillating publicity which can hardly shame our hardened anti-social 
adventurers.
    
Close family networks cutting across the various segments of the power 
structure, legal loopholes, and leakages in the financial system, which 
have become even more accentuated since the liberalisation of the economy, 
will ensure that most of the accused, except the least influential or the 
most dim-witted, will come out unharmed, with much of their power and pelf 
intact. 
    
Most of those who were thus castigated earlier or their progeny, have come 
back with a vengeance into politics, finance, real estate or other 
wheeling-dealing activities. This does not, however, mean that the process 
of accountability now under way should be halted or mitigated. But it does 
underscore the fact that it will not be easy to achieve concrete results 
and that attention needs to be devoted more towards the preventive rather 
than the curative aspects of the disease.
    
What needs to be done, therefore, is to strive for inculcating a culture of 
socially productive work and investment by promoting a structure of rewards 
and fines that will motivate individuals to stay away from rent seeking and 
socially non-productive activities.
    
In this regard, the East Asian example of performance-oriented incentive 
structure seems to hold the greatest promise. This, however, requires a 
careful evaluation and restructuring of our social and economic 
institutions on a large scale to provide a new blueprint for a balanced and 
competitive economy.
    
The present state of our economic management infrastructure and the key 
social institution of education, unfortunately, do not hold much hope for 
producing such a strategy.
    
The countrys Ninth Five-Year Plan, produced largely for the consumption of 
the donors and to overawe the lay public, hardly proves equal to this task. 
Indeed the planning exercise is becoming increasingly irrelevant as there 
seems to be no consensus among political parties about the vision of our 
future, except for the abolition of corruption.
    
Corruption, however, is merely a symptom and not a disease, which the 
nation is not yet willing and prepared to get diagnosed. In the meanwhile, 
witch doctors of all shades of the chameleon opinion abound in giving 
prescriptions for its health, based on their own favourite mixture of 
medicines. There is, however, no short-cut to economic success and social 
cohesion.

<a name="qual">Quality of working life in Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sireko

QUALITY is a matter of perception, and widely differing viewpoints have 
been expressed about the important dimensions of working life. Some people 
associate it with job content, others with working conditions, and wages.
    
Some feel that career mobility opportunities are important, especially 
opportunities to advance to higher-status occupations. Certainly, to many 
people, the quality of supervision (considerate and thoughtful) and peer 
relationships (working as members of a congenial group) are important 
factors. Each of these factors may be a determinant of job satisfactionor 
dissatisfaction.
    
The quality of working life represents a consensus regarding the adequacy 
of such factors in an actual work situation. A more formal definition says 
that the quality of working life is the degree to which members of a work 
organisation are able to satisfy important personal needs through their 
experiences in an organisation.
    
Richard Walton recognises 10 major aspects of quality of work life which 
need special attention of organisations managers and human resource 
planners: The could be listed as below:
    
(a) Adequate and fair pay: fair and equitable pay relationships and equal 
pay for equal work performed.
    
(b) Benefits programmes: adequate and competitive retirement, health 
insurance, vacation, and other employee benefits.
    
(c) A safe and healthy environment: clean and safe working conditions.
    
(d) Job security: continuity of employment so that the employee is 
reasonably secure about the future.
    
(e) Free collective bargaining: the right of all employees to organise in 
unions or other associations to represent themselves as a group or 
profession.
 
(f) Growth and development: consideration of the employee as a growing, 
developing human asset of the organisation.
    
(g) Social integration: a working climate that fosters a feeling among 
employees of belonging and being needed in the organisation.
    
(h) Participation: employee involvement in the operations and decision 
making of the organisation.
    
(i) Democracy at work: a recognition of employee rights and privileges 
compatible with their responsibilities to the organisation.
    
(j) Total life space: a balance between working life and other parts of 
human life: leisure, education, and family life. (Walton-1974) Essentially, 
an emphasis on the quality of working life requires attention to individual 
employee needs and group needs as critical management values. These factors 
warrant attention on their own merits, as ends in themselves and as means 
to increased individual satisfaction. They are not primarily valued because 
of their potential contribution to organisational efficiency or 
productivity improvement, although these may be possible side benefits of 
QWL (quality of working life) programmes.
    
A common misunderstanding amongst Pakistani managers regarding attitudes of 
employees towards work itself and organisations on the whole, productivity, 
quality of work and craftsmanship etc. prevails, without a deep analysis 
and the root causes of such an attitude and behaviour of employees. Common 
beliefs about Pakistani employees could be summarised in the following way:
    
Willy nilly one is compelled to admit that a Pakistani employee [if left on 
his own] does not like work. He would try his best to avoid work if not 
properly supervised and checked. His productivity level is terribly low and 
he is highly demoralised when compared with his counterpart in other parts 
of the world. His attitude towards job and organisation is at best casual 
if not hostile. He does not pay enough attention to the subtleties of his 
job content and, therefore, is least bothered to produce high quality goods 
and services. His craftsmanship is poor even when assisted by advanced 
machinery and equipment.

The wage-output correlation
    
All these observations and beliefs might be true to varying degrees. 
However, no serious attempt has been made especially by managers, 
supervisors, and entrepreneurs to investigate the causes of such attitudes 
and behaviour. Of course, Pakistani employees are not born with these 
attitudes. Further, attitudes, behaviour, norms, and values [positive or 
negative] transfer not through blood from one generation to another, rather 
they are learned through the phenomenon of stimuli-and-response. There are 
a number of environmental factors that influence and effect attitudes and 
behaviour of people at work adversely.
    
For instance, if a maid is not paid reasonable wages for her household job, 
we should not expect from her higher levels of productivity, honesty, high 
quality work, and other positive attitudes towards work.
    
This author has often listened to ill-tempered complaints of people 
regarding their household servants. These complaints range from laziness 
and low integrity to low productivity and excess of holidays. Most of the 
complainants claim that they pay handsome wages and other fringe benefits 
[in the form of free meals, used clothing, and shoes, interest-free loans, 
etc.] in general and household servants in particular are paid at terribly 
lower rates. Monthly wages of these quasi-slaves [i.e. household servants] 
range from a meagre Rs 200 to Rs 1000 depending on the age, experience and 
bargaining power of these employees and social status, locality, affluence 
and relative generosity of their employers. No governmental rules, 
regulations or labour laws concerning minimum wages, gazetted holidays, 
length of working hours, weekly holiday, minimum age limit of workers, 
maximum number of working hours per day, overtime payments etc are 
applicable in case of household servants. Similar working conditions [and 
in many cases even worse conditions] are fate of minors working in such 
small business ventures as motor workshops, roadside hotels and 
restaurants, shops and smaller industrial units [involved in production of 
such items as sweats, biscuits, artificial ornaments, plastic bags, 
medicines, etc.].
    
It would not be an over-statement to say that perhaps no other management 
concept has received as little attention in Pakistan [both from management 
writers, researchers, and practising managers] as the concept of QWL. 
Various aspects of Quality of? The quality of working life [as described by 
Richard Walton] needs immediate attention by legislators, regulating 
agencies, management instructors researchers and writers as well as by 
practising managers/professionals and entrepreneurs. Needless to repeat 
that the quality of work life needs to be substantially improved for all 
segments of work force [especially for children] not because such measures 
would increase productivity and motivation. But various aspects of QWL 
warrant rectification on their own merit, just to build an equitable and 
just society; where man is not free to exploit another man. 
   
Such environment is mandatory not only because this would lead to a more 
peaceful, congenial society but also since in the long run, only such 
societies will survive and flourish.

<a name="econ">Pakistans economic standing today</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
S.S. Hyder

DESPITE the rosy picture of the MOUs and all that wishful thinking about 
Pakistan entering the 21st century as an Asian Tiger, the economy of the 
nation is plummeting. The Pak rupee is getting weaker and weaker, exports 
are falling, imports rising, and life for the man on the street becoming a 
bundle of hardships.
    
The French Ministry of Agriculture cancels the contract of Pakistani fish 
exporter as the quality of the fish is not acceptable due to unhygienic 
packing and processing conditions and non-observation of standards. Japan 
has already banned the import of our shrimps because of pigmentation 
resulting in black spots called Melanosis.
    
Now we dont have enough wheat, sugar, potatoes, tomatoes etc. to eat. We 
grow less and have more mouths to feed till we are forced to these 
commodities from India. What a far cry from the times when this region was 
termed the granary of undivided India. 
    
How the IMF is treating the Government is quite evident.
    
The Government treated the IMF prescription as the panacea for all national 
ailments, but it has itself become a hostage in the clutches of the 
creditors. 
    
Today Pakistans economy harbours four big contradictions. First of all, 
there is the tussle between the present day requirements and the future 
needs. More expenses on today reduce the purse for spending on a better 
tomorrow. While the government goes levying one tax after another, the 
social security net, which is the fundamental right of every citizen, and 
which the masses are demanding, continues to elude them. 
    
However, we have to admit that all is not gloom and that many sincere and 
selfless experts have already given their practical submissions. Whether 
they will make an impact on the governments psyche remains to be seen. 
What is certain is that time is running out and we are heading towards 
bankruptcy. It is again submitted that agricultural reforms are a must for 
the uplift of the national economy. Agricultural land should be given to 
all who want to sweat and toil and grow food. This should be for very 
nominal charges and long lease time say, for 25 years.
    
Small loans on easy terms and conditions be given to the informal sector 
for the development of the economy at the grassroots. Petty workers, 
artisans, craftsmen, and cottage industry entrepreneurs should be able to 
come up. Such innovative experiments in Korea and Bangladesh with its 
Gramaen Bank have shown very promising results. This development may be 
linked further with bigger industries.
    
A labour policy should be chalked out with the consultation of labourers, 
industrialists, the judiciary and the government for complete harmony.
    
Let Pakistan stand on its own feet for self-sufficiency so that our country 
should be free economically. At the moment we are under a debt of $28 
billion. This is the foreign debt we have to pay. The internal debt payable 
is about Rs.859 billion.

Devaluation

Instead of these debts decreasing, they are increasing due to devaluation, 
inflation, and interest. As such, self-sufficiency will always remain 
elusive, the way we are heading. We have to lay special emphasis on the 
informal sector.
    
We must do away with all the facilities and concessions mentioned in the 
Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, Schedule II. That way, we could mop up at least 
Rs.115 billion. Agricultural land must be taxed, the landlord must pay tax. 
This can bring us about Rs 40 billion per year. Only such decisive steps 
taken religiously may lead us towards self sufficiency.
    
Unproductive expenses must be cut down. It is not a stage where the 
government only should be condemned. This is the geba bent of mind which we 
must denounce. This is the general collective social psyche, and it must be 
nipped.

Political brinkmanship
    
The opposition parties, pouncing at the political instability, have drawn 
up a comprehensive charge sheet against the ruling party but that just is 
not the way. If they really want to do something constructive, let them 
just come out with a comprehensive programme for coming to grips with the 
umpteen economic ills afflicting the nation today. They should declare 
demonstrate their sincerity in the abolition of feudalism, boosting the 
informal sector, developing regional trade, minimising import, maximising 
exports, cutting down unproductive expenses, realise that ethnic 
differences can only be solved by economic equality, justice and rule of 
law, through accountability. Respectable nations have opposition parties 
who are equally competent to solve the national, economic and social 
problems of their country through constant debates and dialogue. The nation 
should always have the right of information and a proper law be passed by 
the parliament for the same. A complete survey and report must be published 
about the national wealth and its justified exploitation.
    
Unfortunately, the upstart, noveau riche, get-rich-quick class just do not 
have patience. They want quick, fat returns the moment investment is made. 
They refuse to join the mainstream of the struggle against corruption and 
moral decay in which the people of Pakistan are poised. They would rather 
utilise their time and energy in the frantic race to purchase dollars. And, 
for such people, there is good news. Twenty-two per cent shares of Portugal 
Telecom were privatised in June 1996, setting a record for demand and 
raising a total ESC 147.1 billion (US$94.7 million). Further 22 companies 
in 1996 and 1997 are going to be privatised. The investment where private 
sector may also subscribe are steel, shipbuilding, oil, chemicals, mining 
gas, paper pulp and tobacco as well as airport management and motorway 
construction and operation.
    
In addition to Portugal Telecom, the biggest sales will be global offers of 
Electricdale-De-Portugal, the national power company and CIMPOR a cement 
producer (The Economist, July 1996).
    
The difference between privatisation in Pakistan and Portugal is that in 
case of the former, we just sell off to clear our debts. Even here the 
figures dished out by official agencies leave quite a bit of room for 
doubt. In Portugal, the government is accountable to the masses.
    
In the case of the latter, it is aimed at promoting social and economic 
justice, equality of opportunity, and economic integration. We could get a 
vivid idea of the difference by comparing the stock market of Lisbon which 
has touched record highs, with our stock markets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Oct 27: Former caretaker Prime Minister Moeen Qureshi has 
opposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos latest mini-budget in Pakistan 
saying there was no need to impose additional taxes which are already 
excessively high.
    
Pakistan should reduce the tax rates so that the people can pay and those 
who are assessed are made to pay. Those who cheat must be penalised, Mr 
Qureshi said in an interview with a Pakistan TV Channel, Awaz, telecast in 
Washington on Sunday.
    
Asked whether he was satisfied with the way the government was handling the 
economy, the former caretaker prime minister said: I am not satisfied, I 
am not sure the expenditures of the government are in areas of high 
economic priorities. I am not equally sure that all steps needed to be 
taken to collect revenues are there.
    
As I see the situation it seems the answer is not to apply additional 
taxes. I think Pakistans taxes are already excessively high. The thing is 
to reduce rates so people pay and those who are assessed are made to pay. 
Those who cheat are cheating their fellows and they be penalised.
    
To a question whether Pakistan was about to fall in the debt trap, Mr 
Qureshi said Pakistans foreign and domestic debt has become alarmingly 
large.
    
The concern and focus in Pakistan in the past has been on size of foreign 
debt but main problem is that it is short term and therefore there is a 
risk that Pakistan may not be able to finance it. In case of domestic debt 
it has been growing steadily and rapidly. At present debt servicing is one 
third of the budget which is excessive, he said.
    
He observed: What you are doing is creating an engine of inflation. In 
future it would burden future generations. They will bear the cost of the 
spendthrift policies of this generation. The most important thing that can 
be done is to make absolutely sure that privatisation programmes use their 
proceeds to repay the debt. That is what I had done. I established a decree 
and structure which said every penny obtained from privatisation be used to 
repay the debt. You can stabilise the situation in that way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 28: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has changed her team of 
financial managers and appointed Syed Naveed Qamar and Moeen Afzal as 
federal minister for finance and secretary, finance, respectively.
    
The adviser to the prime minister, V.A.Jafarey, has gone on leave but would 
continue in the same position. The cabinet has granted only one-month 
leave to Mr Jafarey, though he wanted to be away for three months, the 
Secretary, Information, Haji Akram, told reporters at a briefing after a 
cabinet meeting here on Monday.
    
He said the Special Secretary, Ministry of Finance, Moeen Afzal, would 
replace Mian Tayyub Hussain, who had been appointed Secretary, Industries.

Also , the chief executive of the Muslim Commercial Bank has been appointed 
consultant to the ministry of finance.
    
No decision had been taken to replace State Minister for Finance Makhdoom 
Shahabuddin , Haji Akram told a reporter.
    
Asked who would now lead Pakistan at the ongoing talks with the 
International Monetary Fund, after Mr Jafarey had applied for leave, Haji 
Akram said the task had been given to prime ministers Special Assistant 
Shahid Hasan Khan.
    
Sources said the issue of replacing financial managers of the government 
had been discussed and finalised at the cabinet meeting where a consensus 
emerged that such a person should be appointed finance minister as had a 
political background. It was said during the cabinet meeting that time had 
come when the government should stop banking on technocrats.
    
The sources said the prime minister also said she was not in favour of 
appointing technocrats as they only sought lucrative jobs and did not have 
vision to deliver the goods.

<a name="isla">Islamabad, IMF agree on economic reforms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 30 : Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have 
hammered out an agreement on all policy matters, paving the way for 
Islamabad to receive 80 million dollars tranche of 600 million dollars 
Standby Arrangements (SBA) soon.
    
The IMF announced on Wednesday night that it would immediately resume 
financial support to Pakistan.
    
Announcing this the Resident Representative of the Fund in Pakistan said 
the agreement has been reached on all policy matters between the visiting 
mission of International Monetary Fund and the Government of Pakistan on 
stabilisation and reform programme.
    
He said in a press statement that the agreement was based on the measures 
that the government had announced on Oct 22.

Pakistans assurances to achieve 4 per cent GDP budget deficit target and 
single digit rate of inflation along with limiting undue monetary expansion 
during the current financial year, had helped to convince the IMF team to 
resume Pakistans assistance, sources further stated.

This has also happened for the first time that the local IMF office has 
issued any statement confirming that Pakistan and the Fund had reached an 
agreement on major policy matters.

<a name="acti">Active follow-up support sends leading shares higher</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 30: Firmer conditions prevailed on the stock market on 
Wednesday as leading shares tended further higher on active follow-up 
support.
    
End of Jamaats sit-in campaign to oust the government was said to be the 
chief driving force behind the run-up as investors were back in the rings 
to make new account buying.

However, the opening was not that promising as investors were still in two 
minds about the direction of the market and played mostly safe early in the 
session.
    
But the mid-session saw a spat of new buying offers from all the quarters 
led, of course, by some leading institutional traders, enabling the market 
to stage a solid rally.
    
The-KSE 100-share index, therefore, showed a fresh modest gain of 10.93 
points at 1,444.99 as compared to 1,434.06 a day earlier, reflecting the 
strength of base shares.
    
Floor brokers said apart from being in a highly oversold position, the 
market has some other positive developments, which could enable it to 
sustain the current tempo of recovery.
    
Positive feelers from Islamabad after talks with the visiting IMF team 
suggest that the sailing so far is pretty encouraging, they added.
    
They said release of $600m stand-by credit and resumption of foreign aid in 
due course did not allow investors to lay guard and they bought at will.
    
But cue to things to come is certainly provided by the presence of strong 
foreign fund buying and their presence ensure a sustained bull-run, 
analysts said.

However, by and large, the buying interest was largely selective and was 
centred mostly around low-priced blue chips, notably bank, cement, and 
energy shares, which rose in unison but modestly.
    
The new entrant in the active list were led by synthetic shares, which 
recovered sharply on the perception that the 8.5 per cent devaluation of 
the rupee will make import of synthetic yarn most expensive and in turn 
will make them more competitive on the local market.
    
Dewan Salman, Dhan Fibre and Pakistan Synthetics were among the leading 
gainers in the synthetic sector.
    
Other good gainers were led by Siemens Pakistan, which rose by over Rs 30 
during the last few sessions on strong support aided by market talk of 
higher earning and an expectations of an interim dividend.
    
Grays of Cambridge, 4th ICP Mutual Fund, PSO, Pakistan Refinery, Shabbir 
Tiles, Orix Leasing and 6th ICP Mutual Fund were among the other major 
gainers. Dawood Hercules fell sharply apparently on news of lower earnings, 
falling Rs 18 but only on 100 shares, reflecting that investors were not 
inclined to part with its shares for fears of further decline.
    
Dadabhoy Insurance, which is currently being quoted spot to forestall 
further steep decline in share value shed another Rs 15 and so did Shell 
Pakistan after rising by Rs 6.50 in late on Tuesday evening trading. Other 
losses were mostly fractional.
    
Traded volume was maintained at the overnight level of 37m shares but bulk 
of it went to the credit of a dozen actives.
    
The most active list was again topped by Hub-Power, up 55 paisa on 6.245m 
shares followed by PTC vouchers, easy 15 paisa on 5.176m, ICI Pakistan(r), 
higher 55 paisa on 1.648m, Dewan Salman, sharply higher by Rs 2.80 on 
1.415m shares and Dhan Fibre, firm 55 paisa on 1.299m shares.
 
Other actively traded shares were led by ICI Pakistan, higher 50 paisa on 
0.455m, MCB, up 55 paisa on 0.298m, and FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, steady 30 
paisa on 0.521m shares.
    
There were 322 actives, which came in for trading, out of which 121 shares 
suffered fractional declines, while 118 rose, with 83 holding on to the 
last levels.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE thinking people of Pakistan believe their country is viable, that 
nature has gifted it with sufficient resources, that its people if well-
educated and well-led can be industrious and productive.
    
The thinking people of Pakistan loathe the plunderers, the liars, the 
cheats, the fools and the charlatans who claw themselves into power and 
have, over the years, rocked and weakened the countrys very foundations 
until we find ourselves where we are today, nearing rock-bottom.
    
The perception of the thinking people of Pakistan now is:
    
The edifice of the state  It does not stand on a level plane. It rests 
precariously on four pillars. Two of these, the Army and the judiciary, 
hold up the two corners of one diagonal. The third corner is weakly 
supported by a seemingly strengthened President, and the fourth by a 
threatened beleaguered Press. The conventional pillars, the legislative and 
the executive, crumbled long ago.
    
The army  Our COAS, General Jehangir Karamat, a professional soldier, does 
not favour martial law and has no ambitions to impose it or to take over. 
He has earned the peoples respect. The general well knows that when the 
Prime Minister angrily publicly declares that she will never slash the 
defence budget, this is said to rouse the peoples sense of deprivation and 
their anger against the army.
    
The judiciary  Headed by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah. It is asserting 
itself. It has so far withstood pressures exerted by the executive. The 
judges are on the right track towards full independence. The people are 
forgiving of any past weaknesses perceived.
 
A five-member bench of the Supreme Court is now adjudicating an important 
issue. Assisting them as amicus is my friend, Jadoogar of Jeddah 
Sharifuddin Pirzada. The nearer he gets to his Maker, the weaker his heart 
pumps, the straighter he gets. He wishes to be remembered as a statesman.
 
During the October 22 hearing, the Presidents lawyer, Shahid Hamid, made 
the request that the government make public the Mehran Bank report 
exonerating the President. This is a just demand. The court is competent to 
order that it be produced.
    
The President - Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan, Tumandar Leghari, a perfect 
partyman for two and a half years from December 1993, has been forced by 
circumstances (or otherwise) to find his feet. As long as he proceeds along 
this course, he must be supported. As supreme commander of the armed forces 
he rightly appointed (whether forced to or not) on pure merit, General 
Karamat as COAS. Had he given in to the urgings of the Prime Minister and 
appointed one of her favourite generals, we would have been in deep 
trouble.
    
Constitutionally, the President can be as powerful and effective as he 
wishes to be. When the country has to be saved, he has to take quick 
decisions. Half-measures will not work. He is aware that the Prime Minister 
is doing everything possible to deviate, or to stall, in order to lengthen 
her second spell in office, to cling to power, come what may.
    
The Prime Minister  The least said about her, her family, the prowlers in 
her kitchen cabinet, her sycophants and bag- carriers in her secretariat, 
the better. None of them can mend their ways. She has no remorse. She 
admits to no faults. Her word now carries no credibility with the people, 
the President, or the IMF.
    
The Parliament  The people say to those that sit therein what Oliver 
Cromwell said to the Rump Parliament in 1653, You have sat too long here 
for any good you have been doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with 
you. In the name of God, go. But remain in the country till the 
accountability commissioner catches up with you.
    
The new honourable Attorney-General  On October 20 he rang. I am Iqbal 
Haider. Which Iqbal Haider? I asked. Groovy, he said. Do not condemn me 
without hearing me. Why should I condemn you? I replied. I like you. You 
are as innocent of law as any of your party cronies and contenders for the 
post. You are not part of the evil that surrounds and supports you, and 
that is a great plus point. As far as the people are concerned, Groovy is 
as insignificant as his predecessor Qazi Jameel. They know that he is not 
the first law officer of the land who will merely advocate his partys 
cause.
    
The Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan - Dawns headline, October 23: 
Yaqub warns money-changers, over the sentence ...He also sounded a stern 
warning to money changers blaming them for rumour-mongering and speculation 
about devaluation.
    
A citizen breaks no law by being realistic and apprehending a reality. Does 
the governor not know that when men likened to Capone or Dillinger seek 
investments, nothing comes in? The people know of no good reason why the 
rupee should rise. I say that if things do not change incisively and 
instantly, the price of the dollar may well be Rs.50 by the end of 
December.
    
On October 22, the governor announced a mini-budget. A budget is by 
definition a political statement, setting out the economic platform of the 
party in power. It can never be a bureaucratic exercise. Constitutionally, 
the presentation and approval of a budget in parliament is the litmus test 
of the governments control over parliament. By announcing a mini-budget 
the governor has contravened a fundamental rule relating to public 
servants, and has trespassed into the field of politics. He should stick to 
what is expected of him and, for one, tell us what action he intends taking 
in the National Investment Trust fiasco.
 
When Asadullah Sheikh was appointed Chairman and Managing Director of NIT 
in January 1994, spread all over the Press was the news that young 
inexperienced Asadullah will be controlled by either Mr A or Mr Z, and that 
by accident or design, the NIT unit holders could be relieved of as much as 
Rs.10 million per day, to somebodys the advantage. When he was relieved of 
his position early this month, he had more than completed his mission.
    
Copies of Yaqubs State Bank report on NIT, prepared in July 1996 were 
distributed to the NIT trustees at the Board meeting on October 1, as part 
of the last item on the agenda, Any other matter. According to this 
report, Asadullah and his Board of government-nominated trustees oversaw 
the blatant robbing of close to a billion rupees of unit holders money held 
in trust by them.
    
In autumn 1995, Asadullah, obtaining the approval of his Board, disbursed 
Rs. 5225 million to Chakwal Cement Company Ltd, against 52.5 million shares 
of the company at Rs. 10 each (the market price was Rs. 8.50). This despite 
the fact that NIT had received no dividend income in 1994-95 from any of 
the Chakwal Groups companies on its investment of Rs. 290 million, that it 
had an aggregate capital loss of Rs. 117 million on its total investment in 
the Group, that Chakwal Cement does not expect to give any dividend until 
2001. All this was done when the State Bank knew that the Groups overdues 
and defaults totalled over half a billion rupees (Rs. 536 million). Chakwal 
Cements shares are now quoting at Rs. 3.80. Capital loss, Rs. 325.5 
million.
    
In January 1996, Rs. 49 million was disbursed to an unlisted company, Schon 
Refinery Ltd, by MD Asadullah without Board approval. No one from NIT had 
visited the project site, nor examined the feasibility report nor monitored 
its implementation. In lieu thereof, NIT was promised 2,446,000 shares of 
the refinery at Rs. 20 per share when floated. The Rs. 10 shares carried a 
premium of Rs. 10, allowed by the Corporate Law Authority. At the time the 
money was given, the State Bank knew that overdues and defaults of the 
Schon Group stood at Rs. 141 million. The refinery project has been 
abandoned and the unfortunate young new professional Chairman and Managing 
Director Razi-ur-Rahman is left holding a worthless piece of paper.
    
The public perception is that among others, those culpable for this loss 
which the unit holders (pension funds, pensioners, widows, housewives, 
small savers, the poor) have been deliberately made to suffer are the 
Government of Pakistan, the State Bank, the Corporate Law Authority and the 
government- nominated Chairman and Managing Director Asadullah Shaikh (now 
reportedly enjoying his R&R leave in England), and the Trustees of NIT.
    
The honourable governor will doubtlessly remain silent.

<a name="beyo">Beyond accountability</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

AT least, we all seem to agree that something good and positive has been 
done. There is a muted welcome for the Accountability Bill but because we 
have become cynics, having been taken for a ride too often, it is a sort of 
wait-and-see welcome.
    
Predictably and understandably there has been opposition to the Bill, but 
not on principle but on its modalities. Some of this opposition comes in 
the category of point scoring. There is nothing wrong with that. It is a 
part of the cut and thrust of politics. Accountability has become a battle-
cry, it encapsulates all our grievances and we attribute all our misery to 
the fact that those in the public domain are able to do whatever they 
please whether being answerable, leave alone being punished for wrong-
doing.
    
Accountability, however, is applied only to financial impropriety which 
covers a multitude of sins, commissions, kick- backs, under-the-table deals 
and outright bribery. We choose not to see accountability in a wider 
context. For instance should there not be accountability for the many 
disastrous policies that were pursued, the policies to live beyond our 
means by accumulating debts? This was considered smart economics and the 
prowess and skill of government functionaries was measured by their success 
in negotiating loans. No thought was given to the grim reality that these 
loans would have to be paid back in those halcyon days. And should there 
not have been accountability for the mother of all disastrous policies that 
led to the creation of Bangladesh?
    
When there was a major rail accident in India, the Minister of Railways, 
the late Lal Bahadur Shastri resigned accepting responsibility. When a JAL 
aircraft met with an accident, the chairman of the airline resigned. It 
would seem it is not a part of our culture to accept responsibility for 
failed policies. The most we will do is to pass the buck and nail some low 
level functionary and make him a scapegoat. There have been countless 
commissions of inquiries, all starting with a bang and ending not only with 
a whimper but the findings put in cold storage to gather dust or consigned 
to some bureaucratic limbo.
    
Still, the need of the hour is to curb corruption if not eliminate it and 
no one can disagree that some sort of reckoning is needed. It is also 
necessary that this reckoning or accountability should be without fear or 
favour, should be seen to be above board and not deteriorate into a witch-
hunt. The Prime Minister has done well to offer herself for accountability. 
Let all others follow suit, particularly those who have been casting stones 
with abandon.
    
Corruption is perceived as the root of all our evils and well it may be. 
The Accountability Bill could be a start. But we need to go beyond it. We 
must see the fight against corruption as moral cleansing and not political 
therapy. This, however, is easier said than done.
    
In all the sound and fury, the dust and heat of corruption charges and 
counter-charges, we have totally forgotten that there is an endless list of 
basic wants and these are going unaddressed and even if we have a 
corruption-free society, an unlikely if not a utopian prospect, more than 
half our population would still need safe drinking water, will need some 
measure of health care, will need education. When are we going to re-adjust 
our priorities?
    
Corruption is not peculiar to our country. We need only to look around our 
neighbourhood to know that corruption is flourishing and in robust health. 
One has only to read Indian newspapers to know how endemic it is in that 
country. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, even China are not lily-white 
societies. But they are going ahead with their social agenda even as a few 
(or many) line their pockets. It is interesting to note that despite the 
best efforts of Senator Dole to nail Bill Clinton on what are perceived to 
be acts of gross wrong-doing and financial hanky-panky, Whitewater being 
one of them and the Indonesian connection being the latest, Clinton remains 
well ahead in the polls. It is not that the American public condones wrong-
doing but they are more concerned about the real issues, matters that will 
affect or improve the quality of their lives. John Majors Tory Party is 
beset with scandals but these scandals will have only a marginal bearing on 
the future prospects of the Tories.
    
I do not believe that we can have a corruption-free society. Those who are 
saying that they will eliminate corruption are in fact saying that they 
will abolish human nature. When I first went to China in 1956, I was 
enormously impressed by the social changes that were being attempted. One 
of the claims that was made was that crime had been all but eliminated. I 
took this claim at face value but I did ask my interpreter whether this 
meant that the jails had been done away with. He was surprised by the 
question, as if I had bowled him a googly. In 1964 when I went again to 
China, I met the legendary Dr Ma, a Lebanese doctor. He told me that 
venereal disease had been wiped out. again, I had no reason to disbelieve 
him but suggested that there might be an element of exaggeration in that 
claim. The point I wanted to make to him was that while radical changes 
could be brought about in the structure of society, the fundamental nature 
of human beings could not be changed.
    
By all means let us launch a crusade against corruption and let there be an 
across-the-board accountability. But we must get our priorities in order. 
Some energy should be saved for setting the basics right, like grass-roots 
social justice so that the people can live with honour and in peace, so 
that we can introduce a sense of purpose in their lives. It may be true 
that people are tired of corruption. But they are also tired of rhetoric 
and bluster.

<a name="amat">A matter of timing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Malick

THE phrase Byzantine intrigues no longer suffices to describe the 
political climate of the federal capital where more intrigues are being 
disclosed or and claimed in one day than those witnessed by the people of 
the Eastern Roman Empire in a whole lifetime. But at the same time, all 
rhetoric notwithstanding, things are far from normal.
 
Starting from her recent exhaustive discourse in parliament when Ms Bhutto 
insisted that she would never resign under any circumstances, even she is 
no longer maintaining any facade of normality, either. Gone is the stance 
where the president was the governments best friend and it faced no threat 
to its existence. Now it appears, the government appears hell bent upon 
painting itself as being the persistent target of an elaborate conspiracy 
which incorporates all the necessary elements such as serious economic 
problems complicated by a crisis of confidence between the prime minister 
and the other two equally important parts of the ruling equation.
    
Already various institutions are engaged in exercises to comprehend the 
consequences of the visibly changed political strategy of the government 
and the situation paper drafted by one particular sensitive intelligence 
agency is believed to be quite incisive.
 
The paper argues that the announcement of the mini-budget by the governor 
of the State Bank, Dr Muhammad Yaqub, who has been at odds with the 
government in the past, is of great significance. It indirectly suggests 
that the main share of blame for the nations financial woes has now been 
shifted away from the government in one stroke. The prime minister has now 
repeatedly claimed that she had told off the IMF on the issue of reducing 
armys budget and would rather resign than agree to this measure. She 
declared that she would rather cut the development expenditure and impose 
new taxes than put the nations security in jeopardy.
    
Knowledgeable people deduce from this working paper that the prime minister 
may have delivered a masterly stroke by projecting two things:
    
a) The IMF package imposed on the people is not her doing but has been 
imposed on her by the presidential camp and factors like the delegation to 
the US being led by Dr Yaqub and the inclusion in it of a supposedly 
presidential sympathiser, Shahid Hassan Khan, are being pointed out as 
reliable indicators.
    
b) She has tried claiming that the harsh economic measures were mandated 
because her government had refused to cut down on armys budget, in other 
words the armys funding requirements may be the biggest contributor to the 
nations continuing economic miseries.
    
However, the fact remains that the latest mini-budget is not a result of 
any new agreement enforced by the IMF to the exclusion of the prime 
minister and her financial team, but is simply a delayed implementation of 
the earlier deals made by her government. Secondly, according to insiders, 
while Shahid Hassan may have enjoyed the confidence of the president in the 
early stages of his career, he no longer figures on the preference list of 
the president.
    
With the prime minister herself conceding the existence of an ongoing 
conspiracy aimed at her ouster little doubt remains on this front. The only 
ambiguity that is there is about the modalities of such a move. The recent 
government manoeuvres tend to suggest that while the prime minister may 
have no intentions to resign a la Nawaz Sharif, she might be angling to be 
evicted forcibly from office but at a time of her choosing and on a cause 
of her liking.
    
If a case is being built against her on the questions of violation of the 
Constitution and the law of the land, it is clear that being the astute 
politician that she is, Benazir Bhutto is preparing a simultaneous counter 
case of her own, that of projecting herself as a political martyr for her 
eventual return to power. What remains to be seen is who gets to do what at 
whose choice of timing. For, in the long run the timing will decide the 
political complexion of our country for decades to come.

<a name="chas">Chasing shadows: the Republics enduring pastime</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

AN unsuspecting traveller, new to the ways of our Republic, might think 
that great issues were at stake in the present political crisis.
    
The President writing admonishing letters to the Prime Minister, the Prime 
Minister using every available opportunity to scream of conspiracies 
against democracy (by which of course she means her own government), the 
Supreme Court sitting in grave judgement over matters referred to it by the 
President, the Lahore High Court hearing Mian Manzoor Ahmed Wattoos 
petition against his ouster as chief minister, the nations permanent 
Doctors of Doom (as a headline in the News describes them) led by Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan rushing in to feast at Wattoos table, an inquiry tribunal 
in Karachi trying to get to the bottom of Murtazas killing which remains a 
mystery only for the Prime Minister, the principal opposition leader 
announcing a nation- wide strike against the governments latest financial 
measures and the government, responding to the Jamaats call for a sit-in 
before Parliament, deciding to seal off the capital completely.
    
What a litany of events and what a picture of turbulence it conveys. The 
unsuspecting traveller alighting suddenly in Pakistan would be forgiven for 
thinking that behind the drama of these events basic issues of a momentous 
nature await resolution. Nothing could be further from the truth.
    
All that has happened in this chaotic year is that another government (the 
self-immolatory exercise of power being a constant in Pakistani politics) 
has succeeded in turning every gun in sight against itself. As a 
consequence, the principal issue at stake in this crisis is not the future 
direction of the country, as the wishful amongst us would like to believe, 
but the governments survivability. Can it hold on till the next election 
or is it destined for the chop in one form or the other? Important as this 
question is, an answer either way makes little difference to the people 
whose name is invoked every time a pundit wishes to make a sweeping 
statement or a politician is about to rend the skies with another slogan.
    
Benazir Bhuttos bizarre and almost surreal gift for defying common sense 
and insisting, against the evidence, on her infallibility is not at issue 
here. Among the long line of failures and mediocrities who have flitted 
through the halls of government in Pakistan, her name and that of her 
husbands who has shared power with her, will perhaps shine the brightest. 
There are princes and rulers who leave no trace in history. The dyarchy of 
Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari will be remembered not so much for its 
slime and corruption as for its sublime heedlessness  for doing things, 
questionable things most of the time, without caring for the consequences. 
Yet the point to note is that despite this record, no French or Bolshevik 
Revolution is knocking at the gates in Pakistan.
    
The major charge against the Bhutto government is that it has flouted all 
the rules  whether in awarding contracts, taking decisions or in making 
appointments  and opened needless fronts against the Supreme Court and the 
Presidency. Abiding by the rules is very important for not to do so invites 
the anarchy that we are seeing under the Bhutto government. But abiding by 
the rules alone is not the essence or the sum-total of Pakistans problems.
    
We have had governments in the past which observed the rules, which did not 
ride roughshod over merit and which saw to it that discipline was observed 
in the financial and fiscal sectors. The Ayubian decade to which many 
senior bureaucrats, serving and retired, hark back with a nostalgic feeling 
could be cited as the prime example of such a dispensation. About the Zia 
regime too it is said that even if during its soporific and stultifying 
tenure political institutions were destroyed, the integrity of the 
bureaucracy and the financial sector was not violated.
    
Even if these examples are accepted, it is still pertinent to ask as to 
what these two eras achieved, eras which between them account for 22 years 
of Pakistans history? What good did they do the country? At its lower 
levels  those which matter to most people  the administration was not 
more caring or more responsive to public needs than it is today. In fact, 
during the sixties the arrogance of the bureaucracy was as great if not 
greater than the arrogance of the political class which we decry nowadays. 
Corruption was consolidated because the bureaucracy was not accountable to 
anyone except its masters like the Nawab of Kalabagh in West Pakistan and 
Abdul Monem Khan in the eastern wing. Much the same was true of Zia-ul-
Haqs martial law where against the corrupt police officer or revenue 
official most of the time there was no redress.
    
Today at least the cry is strong that the politician should be held to 
account for his actions and misdeeds. This is a good thing but it comes 
from having democracy and a free Press. During the Ayub and Zia eras deputy 
commissioners were kings and federal secretaries part of the divine order 
of things. It should therefore come as no surprise if much of the parroting 
of the phrase good governance comes from the lips of retired and serving 
bureaucrats who conveniently forget that when they were all powerful the 
rules may have been observed but the common man in his relationship with 
the thanedar and the patwari was no better off than he is today.
    
Now suppose today Benazir Bhutto gets her marching orders and Asif Ali 
Zardari the come-uppance which he so richly deserves. If things work out 
smoothly after that we can expect the crisis of power currently bedevilling 
the country to be swiftly resolved. The President and their lordships of 
the superior judiciary will be pleased with themselves. A few heads will 
roll and some of the people now cutting such a fine figure will be shown 
their places. In the higher business of the Republic rules will be observed 
and there will be transparency in the awarding of contracts and other 
business deals involving the state. Without a doubt these are eminently 
good and necessary things to do. But the problems which stifle the energies 
of the Pakistani people and which prevent them from securing their rightful 
place in the sun require much more than the observance of propriety and due 
form.
    
How will the common man benefit from an independent superior judiciary 
whose judges are appointed on the advice of the Chief Justice? Those who 
wax eloquent about the virtues of an independent judiciary forget that in a 
country like Pakistan a Justice Kayani or some other fearless judge can 
influence matters in a small number of cases only. The systematic and petty 
tyranny which the toiling masses (no cliche this) have to put up with in 
their relationship with the thanedar and the patwari (the twin symbols of 
the Pakistani state) remains unchallenged and unaffected. For each Feroza 
Begum who is provided relief by the superior judiciary there are hundreds 
of other people who have no defence or redress against the arbitrariness of 
state authority. After the recent attack on SHO Zeeshan Kazmi hundreds of 
people were rounded up and brought to the Khokrapar Police Station. How 
many of them can approach the high court? And if they cannot, what remedy 
can the Chief Justice of Pakistan have for their plight?
    
Benazir Bhutto and her husband are symbols, albeit shining ones, of what is 
wrong with the country. But they neither encompass nor exhaust the problems 
of Pakistan because these problems are much greater than their persons. To 
really suppose that much goodwill come from the present rage over 
accountability (a word so grossly misused and so often that its unthinking 
use deserves to be made a cognisable offence) is to invest faith in 
trifles.
    
Of course, a start has to be made somewhere and anything done in the name 
of accountability will be a good start. But there should be no illusions 
that such a process, given the instruments at hand, will amount to no more 
than scratching the surface of he problem. The terms of the Pakistani 
revolution we are currently witnessing are limited: to ensure simply that 
in the conduct of government the rules, such as they are, are not brazenly 
violated. This is a formula for tinkering, not an agenda for change.

<a name="from">*From messenger to youngest Test player</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Representative

FAISALABAD, Oct 24: A boy, who just started his cricket only two years back 
and also served as a messenger at the National Stadium Press box, is now 
the youngest player to earn a Test cap.
    
Hasan Raza is the teenager who has broken a long standing record of 
compatriot and now his manager Mushtaq Mohammad by a long margin of 251 
days.
    
Raza, born on March 11, 1982 at Karachi, started serious cricket in 1994 
when he joined one of the city clubs, Khudadad Gymkhana. In an years time, 
he went onto skipper KCCA Zone II in the KCCA Inter-Zonal Under-14 
Championships and a year later i.e. this season, he earned the selectors 
nod for the Junior World Cup in England. Good performance there, helped 
Raza earn selection for the KCCA Under-19 team which was to defend its 
title. Raza not only helped KCCA retain the honour but he helped himself by 
slamming four centuries, including one in the final, watched by the 
national selection committee.
    
Picked up for the Sahiwal three-dayer, Raza played impressively for 58 and 
22 but failed to earn a call for the Sheikhupura Test. But Shadab Kabirs 
failure and his personal innings of 96 and 22 in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy 
match between Karachi Blues and Whites, made the selectors to invite him 
for the series decider.
    
Now that he has taken the field, and has opened his account with a 
magnificent boundary off Paul Strang, it is to be seen how he fares in the 
Test and in future.
    
I will show that I am good enough and the selectors have done right by 
selecting me ahead of many other senior pros, a modest but determined 
Hasan Raza said.
    
Raza, second of three brothers and as many sisters, didnt hide his 
ambitions either. I want to go step by step. I am not in a hurry. I want 
to perform in this Test, then in the next and so on.
    
I dont believe in achieving landmarks. I only believe that if I ensure my 
place in the team, I will be able to walk over all records, Raza, a Matric 
student of Boys Secondary School, FC Area, said.
    
Hasan Raza said My happiness was unlimited when I was selected for the 
World Challenge Cup in England. So you can judge what I would be feeling 
playing Test cricket with the players I watched on television. Its an 
honour, pride and the greatest moment of my life. I hope I keep carrying on 
from here.
    
MUSHTAQ MOHAMMAD: Mushtaq Mohammad, who saw his record vanish from the 
record books from the players gallery, was all praise for Hasan Raza. I 
congratulate him and wish him the best of luck.
    
He has been picked purely on merit. He forced his way after scoring so 
many runs in different levels of the game. This means the boy has something 
and it is precisely why he has been selected ahead of hundreds of 
cricketers. Now lets see what he does in the most difficult stage of 
cricket.

<a name="ince">Incentive bonus for players</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Representative

FAISALABAD, Oct 24: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is planning to 
introduce incentive bonus for the national team. The lucrative cash 
incentive is expected to be enforced with the coming series against New 
Zealand.
    
A meeting of the players and the PCB, in this context, is scheduled to be 
held immediately after the conclusion of the ongoing Test series.
    
Besides the cash incentives, players claims for pay raise may also be 
accepted at that meeting.
    
The players are asking for raise of at least 50% in the match fee, tour fee 
and other allowances. Players fees was last time increased some seven 
years back.
    
It would not be out of context to mention here that the players are 
currently being paid Rs 1,500 as daily allowances as compared to Rs 2,500 
they received during the World Cup. Similarly, on foreign tours, other than 
England, players get a daily allowance of US $ 50. In England, players got 
60 pounds besides 200 pounds weekly.

<a name="amon">A month of world cricket records</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

October had been a month of records in cricket, initially set against 
Pakistan but latterly the feats of some Pakistani willow-wielders came as a 
pleasant shock to the games enthusiasts. The matches became absorbingly 
interesting but statisticians, as was to have been expected, brought to the 
notice of the fans the achievements - the facts and figures - of the 
cricketers. While brisk batsmanship, clever bowling and quick fielding 
would provide glamour to the game a record set and shattered would betray 
the fulfilment of an achievement. Certainly the game becomes more 
challenging with the combatants trying to attain new accomplishments.
    
As we talk of statistics in such an attractive game as cricket many may ask 
as to who set the first record? Undoubtedly no batsman can think, even in 
his wildest dreams, of emulating the feat of Charlie Bannerman, the 
Australian, who took strike to the first ball bowled in the first Test 
match in cricket in March 1877 at Melbourne and scored the first century - 
a hundred on debut. For England in the same inaugural Test the first 50 was 
scored by Henry Jupp, the opener. Perhaps it is improbable to repeat the 
outstanding performance of Sir Pelham Warner who hit a century on debut and 
carried his bat through the innings in a difficult Test for England against 
South Africa in February 1899 at Johannesburg - two feats in one and the 
same Test. However, no instance can be found of a father and son making the 
same record. Nazar Mohammad opened the innings for Pakistan in the Lucknow 
Test against India in October 1952 and remained unbeaten with 124 at the 
end of the knock. Thirty years later son, Mudassar Nazar carried his bat 
against India at Lahore with an unbeaten score of 152. Desmond Haynes, the 
West Indies opener, stands alone in thrice remaining not out in completed 
innings for his country. 
   
As mentioned earlier that October was the month of records. The South 
Africans started it, though in a one-day international in the Nairobi 
quadrangular with a world record between Daryll Cullinan and Jonty Rhodes 
for the fourth wicket. Playing against Pakistan the two hit 232 to eclipse 
the previous mark of 173 set by the Austrians Dean Jones and Steve Waugh 
against Pakistan in Perth in January 1987.
    
The South Africans effort was followed by the hurricane hitting of 
Pakistans teenager, Shahid Afridi, who scored a one-day hundred in just 37 
balls against world champions, Sri Lanka. He drove, hooked and pulled the 
Sri Lankan bowling with gay abandon and set alight the Nairobi ground. He 
cut the Sri Lanka pace and spin attack to pieces and turned the match into 
a melodrama. Afridi snatched the record of Sanath Jayasuriya, previously 
set with 48 balls against Pakistan in Singapore last April. Jayasuriya too 
came under Afridis ruthless onslaught.
    
At Sheikhupura captain Wasim Akram smashed two world records. With Saqlain 
Mushtaq he sent out of the record books the 65-year-old standing eighth 
wicket score of 246 by Leslie Ames, batsman-cum-wicketkeeper, and Gubby 
Alan, against New Zealand at Lords. Allen, later on knighted, came at the 
fall of the seventh wicket at 190. Both Sir Gubby and Leslie Ames made 
centuries to set their eighth wicket mark and take England out of a tight 
spot.
    
At Sheikhupura Pakistan were in real trouble with a score of 237 for seven 
against Zimbabwes ample total of 375 in the first knock. Initially both 
Wasim and Saqlain were watchful and sedate but then Wasim opened out and 
literally collared the Zimbabwean bowling. He, along with Saqlain, not only 
smashed the Ames-Allen mark but set their own record of 313 which it will 
be difficult for any lower order pair to improve on. In his undefeated 
innings of 257 Wasim hit 12 huge sixes to surpass the 10 over-boundaries 
scored with lightning strokes by Englands Walter Hammond against New 
Zealand at Auckland in April 1933 in an unbeaten innings of 336 that is 
still the fifth highest in Test cricket. Hammond had come fresh from a 
double hundred at Christchurch in an earlier Test.
    
Wasim showed the savagery of his bat not only to thrill the cricket fans at 
the new Test venue but saved the team from a threatening situation. 
Saqlains 79, his highest batting effort in Test, was equally praiseworthy 
for the world record may not have been attained without the youngster 
giving a stand to the captain and exhibiting assurance in his batsmanship.
    
Wasims accomplishments may raise the confidence and morale of the team 
after the defeat at the hands of South Africa in Nairobi. They may not only 
put up a good performance against Zimbabwe but show bravery and chivalry 
against the New Zealanders or before that in Sharjah.
    
Yet another unique record has been created by schoolboy, Hasan Raza, who 
has become the youngest cricketer to appear in a Test match at the age of 
14 years and 227 days. Hitherto Mushtaq Mohammad had this distinction. 
Making his Test debut for Pakistan against West Indies in Lahore in March 
1959 Mushtaq was aged 15 years and 124 days. At one time Khalid Hasan while 
getting his Test cap at Nottingham against England in 1954 was the youngest 
cricketer with 16 years and 352 days. But Mushtaqs name stood for 37 years 
in the Wisden record section. Now Hasan Raza, a product of catch em 
young scheme of MCB, takes his rightful place as the youngest Test 
debutante.

<a name="maki">Making Lara captain wont solve W.I. problems</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Representative

FAISALABAD, Oct 26: Appointing Brian Lara as West Indies captain was by no 
means the only solution to reach the same heights the team achieved in the 
70s and 80s. This was observed by former West Indies Test star, Jackie 
Hendricks.
    
Hendricks, a former selector and manager, who is here as Match Referee, 
believed that the West Indies team can only achieve what they achieved in 
the past if they produced the same quality players.
    
A captain cannot do anything until he has good players under him. He has 
to be inspirational but he still needs batsmen who can score and bowlers 
who can get wickets, Hendricks, who managed the West Indies team led by 
Viv Richards here in 1986, said.
    
Hendricks emphasised that Brian Lara was certainly a player whom the West 
Indies can look forward to taking over the helms of affairs. But I think 
the management would not be expecting that Lara would perform miracles.
    
Lara did exceptionally well both as a player and as a  captain when he led 
the Under-19 team and the Trinidad and Tobago team in the Red Stripes Cup. 
But all will depend what quality of players he gets when he takes over as 
captain.
    
When Lara will take over the team from Courtney Walsh, the biggest task 
before him will be to build team spirit and co-ordination. I think this is 
the element which is lacking in the current side.

<a name="mali">Malik, 72, steers Pakistan to win over Zimbabwe</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

QUETTA, Oct 30: Salim Malik proved once again that he was the jewel of a 
batsman in the Pakistan team when he spearheaded the home side to an 
exciting three-wicket win over Zimbabwe in the first game of the three-
match-one-day series here at the Akbar Bugti Stadium on Wednesday.
    
Malik played a delightful innings of unbeaten 72 as Pakistan secured the 
victory target of 238 with just five balls to spare. The most experienced 
one-day player in the arena today with 238 games, was later adjudged Man-
of-the-Match.
    
While Salim Malik celebrated his 40th half century in style by almost 
steering Pakistan to victory single-handedly, there was also joy for 
skipper Wasim Akram who became the first-over bowler to capture 300 wickets 
in limited-overs cricket.
    
Akram, who already has 311 Test scalps under his cap, reached the milestone 
when he trapped David Houghton in front of the wickets on the fourth ball 
of the day.
    
Besides Akram, Hasan Raza also had a memorable match when he became the 
youngest one-day player at the age of 14 years and 233 days. He shattered 
the record of compatriot Aqib Javed who had made his debut against the West 
Indies in Australia some seven years back at the age of 16 years and 127 
days.</pre>
