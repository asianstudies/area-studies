<a name="govt">Govt stonewalled on question of appointments in national carrier</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick  

ISLAMABAD, Jan 29: The governments uneasiness in answering any 
queries involving army officers, or their kin, became evident when all 
such questions in Senates question hour were stonewalled by the 
treasury.
    
For the third time the government appeared extremely reluctant in 
furnishing a reply to questions relating to the appointment of the son 
and daughter-in- law of the military secretary to the prime minister 
in the national carrier.
    
Anwar Bhinder had inquired Whether it is a fact that Kamran Quyum son 
of military secretary to the prime minister and Mrs Sajida daughter-
in-law of the military secretary to the prime minister were inducted 
in PIA in pay group 6 & 5 respectively, if so, the date of their 
appointments, the pay fixed, the name of the selection board, the date 
for inviting of the applications and the criteria for their selection 
and the place of their present posting.
    
Exasperation was written large on the face of minister of state for 
law, Raza Rabbani, as he promised to provide the information 
directly to Sen Bhinder. But Sen Bhinder wasnt buying time, and 
neither was the chairman of the Upper House. Concurring with Mr 
Bhinders logic for declining the offer, Wasim Sajjad said the entire 
House would like to know the answer and not Bhinder alone.
    
Upon hearing the chairs views, Mr Rabbani immediately changed tactic 
and cagily emphasised that I dont want to be misunderstood, I said I 
would try to get the answer by tomorrow. He also wanted the chair to 
allow him more time for getting the information. But Mr Sajjad in no 
obliging mood and ordered the question to be included on the list for 
Tuesday, incidentally the last day of the current session as well. It 
was a difficult moment for Mr Rabbani who, forever ready to take on 
the opposition, clearly did not want to be bogged down in such a 
delicate situation and thinking better of carrying the cross for the 
defence minister, let go of the matter.
    
The other question pertaining to armed forces personnel was also 
buried way deep at serial number 114 of the question hour list and 
once again a simple question had remained inexplicably unanswered. The 
MQMs Ishtiaq Azhar had inquired: Whether it is a fact that a few 
retired army officers have been inducted into the secretariat group 
recently, if so, their names, designations and experience and whether 
it is also a fact that all rules have been relaxed while making these 
appointments, if so, its justification.
    
Unlike the earlier question, the government did not even bother 
offering a promise of a reply and the only one line reply proffered 
stated that reply not received.
    
The strategy of stonewalling seemed to work for the government because 
when Dr Sher Afgan did offer a reply to another question he only ended 
up putting the government in an awkward position while personally, his 
extremely insolent attitude earned him the chairs ire.
    
The clash was sired by a privilege motion moved by Fazal Agha who 
contended that in the past, while replying to his question regarding 
the grant of transit trade permits for Afghanistan, the government had 
claimed that no permits had been issued. Whereas, replying to 
another question by Sen Ibrahim some time later, the government 
conceded that 3,400 such permits had been issued. He, therefore, 
claimed a breach of privilege. Incidentally, the reply Fazle Agha had 
referred to had been made by none other than Dr Afgan himself who was 
standing in for the commerce minister.
    
It appeared as if the minister had suddenly seen red as he took it 
upon himself to offer an explanation. He said as far as he was 
concerned his reply categorically excluded the involvement of the 
commerce ministry in the issuance of any such permit and he could not 
speak on behalf of any other authority which may have issued these 
permits. The commerce ministry has imposed a ban on issuing such 
permits, he concluded in a dismissive tone. The reply led to a brief 
haughty exchange between the minister and some opposition senators who 
challenged the logic of one minister conveniently passing on the buck 
to some other authority. At this point the chairman, too, decided to 
join the fray and thats when the real action started.
    
Dr Afgan and Wasim Sajjad have locked horns in the past also over the 
thorny issue of the government flaunting his orders for the production 
of detained senators in the house, and that tension clearly translated 
into the heightening of tensions from the word go. Mr Sajjad blasted 
the minister for trying to absolve himself of the collective 
responsibility of the cabinet by offering the lame excuse of the 
commerce ministry not being involved.
    
When an equally harsh sounding Afgan reiterated his earlier stance an 
irritated Mr Sajjad told him to sit down as he was himself confessing 
to being ignorant about who had issued the permits and why.
    
The situation, destined for further deterioration, was somewhat saved 
by the timely intervention of the leader of the house, Malik Qasim. He 
assured the House that he would personally put the details before 
the House and when the chairman wanted to put off the matter till 
Tuesday he implored for an extension on the grounds that some of the 
concerned ministers were not in town. I might not be able to get in 
touch with them and, therefore, I do not want to mislead the House, 
he said. By now the chairmans anger seemed to have dissipated and the 
matter was put off for discussion at some future date.
    
The other date that could prove unsettling for the government was 
proposed by Sen Tariq Chaudhry who wanted the next meeting of the 
privileges committee to be held in premises where senator Saeed Qadir 
is being detained by the government. He argued that since the 
committee has to hold a voting for the election of its chairman, it 
was the inviolable right of the jailed senator to exercise his vote, 
a desire he had also conveyed in writing to the chairman.
    
Apprehending the governments determination in not complying with the 
chairs ruling to produce the jailed senator in the House, Tariq 
Chaudhry requested the chairman to take the committee to the jailed 
senator instead. You have the power to do this and I hope you will, 
he said.
    
A sympathetic sounding Wasim Sajjad immediately remarked: It can be 
looked into. The chairmans reply must have made Raza Rabbani rather 
uncomfortable because the unprecedented spectacle of a parliamentary 
House committee holding its elections inside a jail are bound to make 
news headlines.

<a name="oppo">Opposition again stages walkout from Senate</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick    

ISLAMABAD, Jan 30: With the opposition maintaining an average of one 
walkout a day, the practice seemed to have become an unofficial agenda 
of sorts in the current sitting. In fact, two walkouts on the last day 
of the session looked like a perfect finale.
    
The first walkout, as has been the norm, was led by MQM senators 
protesting against alleged extra-judicial killings in Karachi while 
the other was led by Raja Zafrul Haq condemning the practice of 
legislation through ordinances. The government had laid six 
ordinances before the House.
    
After a persistent hounding of the government and three rota days 
later, opposition senators finally managed to extract partial 
information regarding the PIA employment of the son and daughter-in-
law of the military secretary to the prime minister.
    
Raza Rabbani, informed the House that the issue of the two 
appointments had been played up by the Press in the past as a result 
of which the daughter-in-law had already resigned, while the son had 
taken a long leave of absence without pay.
    
Claiming that the appointments had been made on merit, he nevertheless 
stopped short of divulging details of the manner of the appointments 
and other information relating to the identity of the members of the 
selection board. The question was deferred once again for want of 
details of the case.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shadaba Islam

BRUSSELS, Jan 25: International labour groups warned that they will 
continue to campaign for an end to the use of child labour in 
Pakistan.
    
The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), has 
called on the European Union to stop giving Pakistan millions of 
dollars worth of trade preferences because of the alleged use of child 
labour in the carpet, brick-laying, sports and other industries.
    
The European Commission is currently studying the complaint. Bill 
Jordan, the ICFTUs general secretary told Dawn that his organisation 
was not convinced that Pakistan was making a serious attempt to comply 
with ILO standards.

<a name="priv">Privatisation income to be used to retire debts</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Jan 28: The income to be raised from the sale proceeds of 
privatisation of public sector units will be used to retire foreign 
debt. This was stated by Privatisation Commission (PC) Chairman Syed 
Naveed Qamar.

The government has earned Rs42 billion or so by selling public sector 
units so far. The PC is expected to sell United Bank Limited, Bankers 
Equity Limited, Pakistan Times, Mashriq (Lahore), Kot Addu and 
Jamshoro Power Stations, Habib Bank Limited, Faisalabad Electricity 
Board, Karachi Electricity Supply Company (KESC) as well as the 
Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation (PTC) by the end of this year.
    
Most of these units will be transferred to the private sector before 
June, Syed Naveed Qamar said. He said: The commission is not in a 
hurry to sell public sector units. We are proceeding with extra care, 
especially in case of the PTC, to keep the whole process transparent.

<a name="offi">Officials anxiety stops probe into assets</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Jan 25: A wave of anxiety and uncertainty swept through the 
government employees of grade 17 and above when the Federal Anti-
Corruption Committee (FACC) headed by Senator Malik Mohammad Qasim 
sought from them the information about their assets, properties, 
income and expenditure statements, resulting in cabinets decision to 
terminate the process abruptly last month.

Mr Mazharul Haq Siddiqui, in his report to the cabinet, blamed FACC 
for having misconstrued Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 
1994.The FACC circulated on Nov. 2 last a detailed proforma to all 
ministries and divisions asking all the government officers of grade 
17 and above to provide details of their assets, properties, income 
and expenditure statement by Dec. 15.
    
The FACC regulations seek information from the government servants 
about their properties and assets to ascertain a list of names of 
corrupt officials who are living beyond their means of income.
    
The FACC was, however, authorised by the cabinet to get information on 
demand contained in statements of declaration of assets in specific 
cases of alleged corruption.

<a name="bung">Bunglings in motor registration dept</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
G.D. Ghauri

KARACHI, Jan 29: The staff of the Excise and Taxation, Motor Wing 
Department, has evolved new measures to fleece tax-payers of the 
amount that had already been paid by them. It could not be ascertained 
whether the government treasury also suffered losses owing to the 
technique adopted in the department but the tax-payers are stated to 
be certain to suffer losses.
    
The modus operandi of the staff handling computers in league with 
their colleagues is that different entries are made in the computer 
slips and in the registration books of vehicles regarding the period 
for which taxes had already been paid.
    
The Registration Books where entries are hand-written about the amount 
and the tax period are considered authentic by the Taxation 
Department, the computer slips indicating details issued with them 
become of secondary importance and carry no value if they are not 
preserved properly by tax payers.
    
The computer printed slips only if preserved properly could counter 
the wrong entries in the registration books and the tax payers might 
save themselves from duplicate taxes for the same term they are likely 
to pay.
    
If the tax payers are in possession of the computer slips, the 
mistakes then could be rectified treating them  as mistakes of human 
error, otherwise, the faults would lie on the tax payers who are 
bound to repay again, tax payers who suffered for no fault on their 
part said.
    
Since there is rush of tax payers during the current month which is 
the grace period for paying taxes for the next terms, such sort of 
glaring mistakes were brought to the notice by tax payers. How the 
staff members get rid of the tax payers is anybodys guess.
    
But such sort of alleged bunglings are reported daily by tax payers 
who do not own computer slips to counter the staff, tax payers said. 
The staff members usually affix stamps on the registration books on 
entries of taxes and the period so that they could become ineligible 
by tax payers and the matter thus could become disputable. 
   
The signatures of the staff also appear ineligible sometimes, tax 
payers said. It may be mentioned here that the department is hounded 
by touts of all sorts who run in search of tax payers.
    
No senior excise officer was available after 12.45 to bring alleged 
discrepancies to their notices to rectify them both in the interest of 
tax payers and the government treasury.

<a name="ghul">Ghulam Hussain Unnar dies</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
H. A. Hamied

KARACHI, Jan 25: Haji Ghulam Hussain Unnar, a most controversial 
politician and a strong opponent of the present government, died.
    
He died of cardiac arrest at the hospital where he was admitted with 
heart problem, soon after his return from his hometown, where he had 
gone for the first time in last 22 months after his release on bail by 
the Supreme Court in an alleged case of sedition.
    
During his detention and after his release on bail, his medical 
condition was very bad. Doctors had said that his heart was working 
only 26 per cent and he needed transplantation but he was not allowed 
to leave the country because his name was on the exit control list.    
He had been in and out of the hospitals ever since he was released.    

Mr Unnar remained in police custody for 22 months on various charges 
framed under blind FIRs and in addition to being charged for 
sedition about seven months ago. The sedition case was registered 
against him by the Sindh government for he had written a letter to 
President Farooq Leghari, complaining of delay in deciding his cases 
by the courts and the present judicial system.

<a name="terr">Terrorists killed in real encounters, claims Babar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report  

ISLAMABAD, Jan 27 : Opposition senators, agitating against the alleged 
extra-judicial killing of MQM workers, staged a third token boycott of 
the current session while a defiant interior minister insisted that 
real terrorists had been killed in real encounters.
    
In what has now almost become a routine pattern of opposition crying 
foul and walking out in the wake of every killing of MQM workers, 
Senator Ishtiaq Azhar raised the issue of the death of one Fahim 
Bhoora in police custody, equating it to a cold- blooded murder by the 
authorities. He lamented that instead of waiting for court verdicts, 
the police were busy killing detained MQM workers and supporters.
    
The opposition charges were, however, dismissed as totally baseless 
by an equally determined interior minister. Gen (retd) Naseerullah 
Babar thundered that Fahim Bhoora was a terrorist and the other 
arrested people are terrorists and shall remain terrorists, and as 
long as Im the interior minister I will keep calling them so. He 
said there was no truth in the charges of fake encounters, pointing 
out that over 200 members of law enforcement agencies had so far been 
killed in operations. You dont get these figures in fake 
encounters, he said, adding, when armed terrorists attack law 
enforcement agency personnel, they must retaliate.
    
Commenting on the Bhoora incident , Gen Babar said the terrorist had 
jumped to his own death from an unguarded window of a high building, 
and added that a judicial inquiry has already been launched into the 
incident.
    
Dubbed Gen Jabir by his detractors, the interior minister made no 
efforts to sound appeasing to the opposition or appear accommodating 
on the question of the ongoing police operations in Karachi. He said : 
 I have been acting with a clear conscience and a deep conviction 
that I am taking the right action.
    
An unruffled Gen Babar went on to state that the government did not 
believe in the persecution of any particular ethnic community but that 
the operations were aimed at rooting out the lawless elements.
    
He said the opposition did not defend any form of terrorism, 
including state terrorism, but that it wanted the institutions to 
play their due role instead of Gen Babar making the whole thing into 
some personal affair.

ISLAMABAD, Jan 30: Law Minister Prof. N.D Khan has said that the 
rocket attack by India in Forward Kahuta was out of sheer frustration 
on their part.
    
He called upon all the political parties to condemn the Indian attack 
and show complete solidarity with Kashmiris on February 5  the day of 
solidarity with Kashmiris.
    
If the Altaf Group wants to give a call for strike, they should 
choose Feb. 5 and make sure there are no terrorist activities on that 
day. This would be a great show of harmony with the Kashmiri 
brethren, he added.
    
The law minister said that MQM and the leader of the opposition should 
condemn the Indian attack. Kashmir problem is an issue which does not 
concern any individual but the whole of the nation.

FORWARD KAHUTA (Azad Kashmir), Jan 27: Indian and Pakistani border 
security forces traded gunfire in disputed Kashmir region as thousands 
of people in this small hilly town mourned the death of 21 people 
killed in Indian rocket attack.

An army spokesman said there was exchange of fire in Jammu area in 
which two Pakistani civilians were wounded. The Indians are violating 
the status of working boundaries in Jammu area bordering Pakistan. It 
is serious and we had to take certain preventive measures, he told 
reporters.

It was one of the gravest violations of the cease-fire on the Line of 
Control since last three or four years, an army official said. 
Exchange of gunfire is a routine in this area but this attack is very 
grave violation of the cease-fire.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 30: Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali issued a 
stern warning to India to desist from flexing its nuclear muscle and 
indulging in shrill rhetoric against Pakistan because such 
adventurous and dangerous policies could backfire.
    
We have behaved with utmost restraint and responsibility, 
demonstrating to the world that we are a responsible nation, but our 
restraint must not be read as a weakness. We will take all the 
necessary steps to protect our people and India will pay a heavy price 
for such actions, he warned.
    
Angrily responding to the Indian denial of the rocket attack, the 
foreign minister said it was an absured lie which even the UN Military 
Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) had exposed. He asked 
India for an explanation for the unprovoked attack.

ISLAMABAD, Jan 28: President Farooq Ahmed Leghari said that Pakistan 
would respond to Indian rocket attack on a border town in Azad 
Kashmir, but ruled out any possibility of a war between the two 
countries. The attack killed 21 people and seriously wounded 25.
    
He did not elaborate how Pakistan would respond but said Islamabad 
would not retaliate against civilians on the other side of the United 
Nations-monitored cease-fire line which divides two parts of the 
disputed Kashmir state.

<a name="bidt">Bid to counter Prithvi threat</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Jan 31: Pakistan might be forced to build its own missiles 
if India continues its programme, President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari 
said.
    
Pakistan will do whatever it can to respond for our own security 
because the induction of the Prithvi missile will create a very 
serious and a new threat perception for Pakistan.
    
Leghari said Pakistan had yet to choose how it would counter any 
Indian move to start full-scale production of the Prithvi, which he 
said would be tantamount to deployment.
    
We can also put in our effort to produce an indigenous missile, but 
we wish to avoid such a race, Leghari said.
    
We dont want the introduction of new weapon systems of mass 
destruction. Prithvi is nuclear-capable and that is where its danger 
lies. The response time in Pakistan then becomes just two or three 
minutes, he said. That is why we have been asking for a zero-missile 
regime in South Asia.
    
Asked if Pakistan would demonstrate its own nuclear potential if India 
carried out a test, he said: Pakistan will have to seriously think of 
the options available to it.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 26: An under-custody MQM activist, Fahimur Rehman alias 
Bhoora, was killed when, according to the police, he jumped off the 
second-storey of an under-construction building.

Inquiries made by Dawn revealed that Fahim was believed to be another 
victim of extra-judicial killing as neighbours gave a different 
version of the incident.

Four more MQM workers were among the 23 MQM activists who have been 
killed in alleged gunbattles with police or in custody this month 
among them being MQM activist Ansar Ahmed and his brother Akhtar 
Hussain. His relative Abid Hussain also fell victim to indiscriminate 
shooting when he tried to rescue the wounded people.
    
Family claimed that soon after the attack they asked the occupants of 
a police APC for help but they refused.

In another incident Nazim Mian, and Sadiq Ali, according to the 
police, were among the 15 terrorists who were holding a meeting in 
the C-1 Area graveyard when the police raided the site on a tip passed 
by the chief ministers crime monitoring cell.
    
The police claimed that when they had arrived at the site, the group 
opened fire on them and in the 20-minute gunbattle that ensued, the 
two activists died while the rest fled. Constable Mohammad Ishaq was 
wounded, they said. But the residents of the area disputed the police 
version. Hospital volunteers who saw the bodies also said they had 
been hit in the back from a very close range.

In yet another incident a MQM worker was killed, the victims two 
accomplices who escaped were identified by the police as Tariq Sipahi 
and Nadeem Marbalwalla.

<a name="plac">Placing Sui above politics</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Kunwar Idris

THE MORE the politicians speak, the less the people know. This maxim 
fits well the statements made by the former and present petroleum 
ministers on the disposition of Sui gas field. The obfuscation at both 
ends is patently deliberate to browbeat or to embarrass each other. 
The right of the people to know the facts and contribute to the debate 
is thus being lost in a political wrangle. 

A brief background information should help in understanding the 
assertions of the ministers and what they are trying to state or 
conceal. Sui gas field was discovered in 1952 by Burmah Oil of 
Britain. Two years later Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) was 
incorporated to own and exploit the field. PPL has since then owned 
and operated the field. In this company, 63.9 per cent shares are held 
by Burmah, 29.5 percent by the Government of Pakistan and 6 percent by 
International Finance Corporation. The remaining fraction of one 
percent are held by the public. The majority ownership of the gas 
field thus vests and has always vested in Burma, a foreign company.   

For many years now Burmah has declared its intention to quit Sui; for, 
after its merger with Castrol its strategy worldwide was to 
concentrate on the marketing of oil and lubricants. Burma's effort to 
sell its share in PPL failed to evoke interest of any company of 
standing not even of its old partner in Pakistan, Shell. The reason 
for this lack of interest, broadly speaking, was the fast depleting 
reserves, meddlesome behaviour of the Balochistan administration and 
local tribes and the pricing policy of the Government of Pakistan.    

Over three years ago after a long and expensive process, Burmah chose 
to sell its share to a consortium of Premier of Britain and Dalle 
Albarake of Saudi Arabia. In the circumstances theirs was the best bid 
for Burmah and an acceptable combination for the government because 
Premier possessed the experience of working in Pakistan and Dalle-
Albaraka the money needed for investment.

Mysterious decision    

Having agreed in principle in the first instance, the government 
finally, and mysteriously, chose (in 1992) not to give its consent to 
the Burmah - Premier - Alberaka transaction. To refuse consent, a rule 
of 1949 vintage was invoked which was an anachronism in en age where 
the government is bending ever backward to attract foreign investment. 
The controlling shares in PPL are owned by Burmah. It could sell them 
to anyone it liked. In the spirit of even the archaic rule of 1949 the 
government could have withheld consent only if it suspected the new 
owner was a saboteur or wholly incompetent to manage the field. That 
certainly could not be said about the combination of skill and wealth 
the new buyer represented.    

Whatever the motive or reason for refusal to endorse the transaction, 
and they remain buried in the chests of the political leaders of the 
time (1992), three years critical to the technical appraisal and 
further development of Sui reservoir have been lost. Burma, quite 
justifiably, would not make the huge investment required for it had 
made up its mind to quit. Sui reserves are fast depleting. By the turn 
of the century the production from the field is expected to fall 
steeply. To reach the untapped reservoirs in deeper horizons new 
technology and large investments are needed. Whatever authority, legal 
or moral, the government possesses in influencing Burmah's sale, the 
sole criterion in exercising it should be whether the new owner can 
bring the kind of technology and money needed to sustain the 
production of gas from Sui at the present level of about 60( million 
cubic feet a day (nearly one third of national production) for a 
number of years into the 21st century. When the country is desperately 
looking for foreign investment in all sectors of its economy, 
xenophobia coming into play when a foreign investor wants to come into 
Sui is wholly un-understandable, Foreign capital and latest technology 
combined with the management expertise of PPL built over the past 40 
years could renew the productive life of the field for a number of  
years to come.    

A great setback

Talking of foreign investment, nowhere does the country need it more 
than in oil and gas development. We can run our own banks and 
factories but can neither muster the risk capital nor the advanced 
technology needed for exploration and recovery from deeper horizons. 
It was a setback when Occidental of America, a world giant, after 
years of deliberation chose not to invest in the depleting oil wells 
of Potohar and instead passed them on to a local company for residual 
recovery. The same fate should not befall Sui which is nation's pride 
and a synonym for natural gas even when it comes out of 50 or more 
other wells in various parts of the country. A foreign majority holder 
in the PPI could cause no damage to Sui. He has to produce to the 
maximum to sell in bulk to the distribution companies. Under our much 
publicised policy foreigners can pull out their investment whenever 
they like. An investor in gas and oil field has to wait for long years 
to recover it. It is not cash or machinery which he can pack up and 
sell whenever he likes The fear of foreign exploitation thus should be 
non-existent. In any case the company will be run by Pakistani 
professionals, and even in a free market regime the government will 
have greater say in the pricing and distribution of oil and gas than 
in other commodities and services.

Also figuring in the controversy of the ministers is the Qadirpur gas 
field. The concern shown on the reported sale of Burmah's 8.5 per cent 
and PPL's 7 percent share in this field to the Broken Hill Properties 
of Australia is not at all understandable. With OGDC owning 75 percent 
of the field and operating it, no apprehension should arise on a world 
ranking conglomerate, which BHP is, replacing the present uninterested 
relatively small companies. Qadirpur is the biggest discovery of gas 
after Sui. In this transaction neither the government nor opposition 
should interfere. If at all, BHP should be encouraged to enhance its 
stake in Pakistanis petroleum sector.    

A negative signal went to the world petroleum investors when the 
previous government for no declared reason refused to approve Burma's 
sale to Premier - Albaraka consortium. It went contrary to the 
national policy on investment. That sordid tale should not now be 
repeated when new and bigger willing investors are coming forth to 
replace those who are long seeking to quit.    

They all know their own mind and have their strategies. They are also 
fully capable of safeguarding their own interest. Sui and Qadirpur 
constitute a vital link in the national life-line and should not be 
allowed to become victims to the politics of protest.

<a name="ppls">PPL sale: opposition not based on sound facts</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

There is always more than one side to an argument. And it is always 
prudent to know what all these other points of view are, especially 
while trying to find out the real truth about a billion dollar scandal  
in the making. Let us first see who the main actors are in this high 
drama in the country's gas sector. The first is Burmah Castrol which 
want; to sell all of its 63.91 per cent shares in Pakistan Petroleum 
Limited (PPL) to the second actor, the BHP which in turn wants to sell 
these shares under a back-to-back arrangement to the third actor, the 
Hashoo group. The second actor BHP also wants to purchase 15.5 percent 
shares in Dadirnur gas field ( 8.5 per cent from Burmah Oil Netherland 
Exploration(BONE), a company wholly owned by BC and 7 percent from 
PPL).

A few years back, Burmah's board decided to disinvest all upstream 
petroleum projects/operations, including its equity in PPL. Since then 
Burmah Castrol has been trying to get rid of its shares in the PPL. 
Sometime back, when Shell, a reputable international oil company 
showed an interest in these shares, the government refused to issue 
the NOC (required under the Exploratson and Production Rules 1986) on 
the grounds that country's interests would not be served if the 
majority shares in such a strategic national resource were to pass 
from one foreign hand to another. The NOC was denied again, when a 
consortium of the local employees of the company offered to take over 
the shares. This time the reason given for the refusal was: the 
consortium lacked the needed experience.

So, the BC awaited the arrival on the scene of the right party with 
the right credentials to unburden its PPL shares. But just when it 
thought the waiting time had ended President Farooq Leghari stepped in 
and here is what he has said about the proposed deal involving the 
local Hashoo group: Is the Hashoo group really appropriate or 
qualified for the transaction? The seller is Burmah-Castrol, does not 
appear to have discussed the transaction with Hashoo group.

Does Hashoo group possess the required experience, track record and 
management depth to justify this level of responsibility? After all 
the deal, if it goes through, will place half of the country's total 
gas resources in the hands of one inexperienced private group which 
has only recently entered the oil gas business. It could have 
important monopolis tics implications leading to potentially and 
significantly higher prices for the consumers and resulting in low 
receipts of Gas Development Surcharge revenues for the government."

Buyer's status:

Let us first examine the first part of the Presudential observation 
which questions the qualifications of Hashoo group. On the face of it 
the group does qualify for the transaction as one of its subsidiaries, 
Zaver Petroleum, has already acquired Occidental of Pakistan from Oxy 
of the USA together with its working interest and operation in three 
oil-fields namely Dhurnal Bhangali, and Ratana. Besides this, Zaver 
Petroleum owns percentage working interest in three joint venture 
blocks in OGDC. But there-is, in view of the Presidential doubts, a 
need to look further into the matter with a technical and financial 
toothcomb. Especially, why BC did not deem it fit to sell the shares 
direct to Hashoo group. Also, there is need for some back probing in 
the Oxy deal as a number of questions were raised in the Press at that 
time, especially on the issue of actual price Zaver Petroleum paid for 
the purchase of OPI and Oxy interests in Pakistan. Mr.Sadruddin 
Hashwani, the man behind the Hashoo group, has over the years acquired 
for himself an image of being an adventurer. But such images come 
naturally to men who prove that you can "get rich quick" without 
having to rob a bank. Most of the companies on the Fortune's list of 
500 were started by such men. But still, that is no qualification, and 
the credentials of the group need to be looked into more thoroughly 
before they are allowed to buy the BC shares in PPL.

Question of surcharge

The second part of the Presidential observation is too far fetched. 
The President does not clarify how the monopolistic aspect that he 
fears would appear following the transaction, is being tackled now 
with a foreign company already holding the majority shares in the PPL. 
Also, he does not say how the government has so far succeeded in 
keeping the BC from not interfering with the prices and why the 
present arrangement has so far not threatened the income from 
development surcharge head. Probably those who briefed him on the 
matter have purposely tried to confuse him. The BC not only owns 63.9 
percent shares in the PPL but also owns 8.5 percent share through BONE 
in Qadirpur gas fields, but still, under the rules, it can neither 
interfere with the gas prices, nor can it affect in any way incomes 
from the development surcharge. However, if the BHP which have been 
offered the 8.5 percent shares of BONE in Qadirpur, also get 7 percent 
of PPL shares in the fields, under the rules of the joint venture, it 
gets an effective voice in the decision making process as far as 
Qadirpur gas fields are concerned which alone are contributing Rs. 400 
million by way of Development surcharge. It is this Rs.400 million 
that are being threatened immediately (and that too only if the BHP 
gets the 7 percent PPL share) and not the Rs. 6.6 billion which are 
coming in as development surcharge from Sui and Khandkot.

So, in the real sense, the President is only opposing the sale of 7 
per cent of PPL shares in Qadirpur gas fields to the BHP. Also, as he 
has rightly pointed out, the ECC is not competent to sell these shares 
because the Cabinet decision already disallows the sale of any 
discovered field.

The President, however, has not asked why Hashoo group could not get 
the BC to enter into direct transaction with it and why it needed a 
foreign oil company to play the middle man. He however, has rightly 
wondered whether the offer to sell 7 percent of PPL shares in Qadirpur 
to BHP was the Australian company's compensation for acting as a 
'front' for facilitating the sale of PPL to Hashoo group.

Besides, the President has rightly observed that any action to further 
enhance the attractiveness for BHP through an unrelated Qadirpur/PPL 
transaction, as proposed, without competition and without equal 
opportunity to other oil companies operating in Pakistan would 
undermine the transparency as well as the fair application of the 
Petroleum Policy. However, when the President says that any assurance 
from BHP/Hashoo group on prices would go against the spirit of the 
Memorandum of Understanding signed between IFC and GOP on natural gas 
pricing issue in return for an IFC loan of $80 million. For PPL's 
compression project, he is actually conceding that gas prices are 
bound to go up whether the PPL/Qadirpur transaction goes through or 
not. His argument that it would be in Pakistan's interest to retain 
the maximum options in PPL so that the strategy and policy with regard 
to this field remain free from interference from any private group 
acting in its own narrow economic interests would have been valid and 
acceptable only if that was the position at present. But this is not 
so. At present the GOP owns only 29.41 percent of the PPL. And the 
rest of the shares are with a foreign private company already, with 
only a small fraction in possession of IFC.

However, in order to overcome this weakness, the President has made an 
unique suggestion. He wants the government to buy off BC. And then 
disinvest the shares on the market within two years. In other words he 
wants nationalisation of BC's shares for the time being. Does he know 
the kind of signal that this one single step would send to the world 
outside and to the foreign investors planning to come to Pakistan? And 
then from where does he think he could raise so much money to buy the 
BC options in PPL? From the IFC? Despite what is being desired by the 
President, the World Bank affiliate would not touch the proposal with 
a barge pole. The majority shares of PPL, to the tune of 63.91 percent 
are already in the hands of a foreign company. It also owns 8.5 
percent share in Qadirpur gas. There is no way the government of 
Pakistan can buy these options. So, the whole game appears to be 
intended to keep the BHP from acquiring an effective voice in the 
Qadirpur gas fields. But, the question is, why?

The BHP is a reputable Australian company with over 100 years of 
experience in oil exploration, development and marketing. It has come 
to Pakistan very recently and is engaged in the prestigious two 
billion dollar Iran to Pakistan gas pipeline project. It has already 
spent its money and time on the preparation of the feasibility report 
of the project and now also on defining the project.

Why should there be any reservations if such a company is keen to join 
the mainstream gas production, marketing and transmission systems in 
this country. Such an involvement would be mutually beneficial as the 
consequent enhancement in the understanding of the Pakistani market 
would encourage BHP to expand its investment interests in the 
country's mineral development efforts and on the other hand Pakistan 
would gain immensely in terms of capital and technological transfer.

No private company is bigger than the government. Therefore, whether 
it is BHP or Hashoo group, if they do not operate in this country 
within the parameters set by the government, they could be deprived of 
these assets with one single Ordinance. So, there is no need to panic 
at every privatisation deal. But then it is also prudent to look 
before you leap. And it is always better to debate an issue in the 
open rather than push it through behind the nation's back.

paisa against the dollar, refixing its rate against the green back at 
Rs 34.33 and 34.50 for buying and selling, respectively.
    
The chief worry of the government is to achieve the export target of

The export figures for the first half of the current fiscal year 
showed a decline of over five per cent rather than the projected

<a name="bank">Bank borrowing for budgetary support goes up to Rs 41.2bn</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 29: Bank borrowing for budgetary support by January 4, 
1996 went up to Rs 41.2 billion against the full year target of Rs 
28.1 billion and Rs 18.24 billion recorded in the corresponding period 
last year.
    
The government had earlier claimed that budgetary borrowing had come 
down to less than Rs 40 billion by December 31, 1995, from Rs 55 
billion recorded in the first five months of the current financial 
year.
    
According to the fortnightly report of the State Bank on the liquidity 
and domestic borrowing situation for the period ending January 4, net 
borrowing by the government sector during this period declined further 
by Rs 5.8 billion to Rs 41.3 billion compared with the decline of Rs 
2.9 billion to Rs 47 billion in the preceding fortnight.
    
Net financing for commodity operations had declined by only Rs 0.5 
billion as compared with much larger retirement of credit of Rs 5.7 
billion on this account during the corresponding period last year.
    
Private sector credit, which had risen by Rs 6 billion to Rs 39.9 
billion in the preceding fortnight, rose by a larger amount of Rs 9.1 
billion and stood at Rs 49 billion as of January 4, 1996.
    
In the corresponding fortnight last year, private sector credit had 
expanded by Rs 9.9 billion to Rs 36.6 billion. The expansion, though 
in line with the seasonal trend, indicates the need to further tighten 
the monetary stance in order to contain the domestic credit within 
stipulated limits, the SBP report said.
    
Net foreign assets of the banking system, which had extended a 
contractionary impact of Rs 51.4 billion in the period upto December 
21, 1995, improved by Rs 8.4 billion to (minus) Rs 42. 9 billion 
during the fortnight ended January 4, 1996.
    
Domestic credit expanded by 12.44 per cent or Rs 94.8 billion which 
was higher by 0.03 percentage point or Rs 0.25 billion than last 
reported up to December 21, 1995, and compared favourably with the 
expansion of 1.1 per cent or Rs 9.1 billion reported in the preceding 
fortnight.
    
Expansion recorded so far, 12.44 per cent, was, however, much higher 
than the expansion of 3.70 per cent recorded in the corresponding 
period last year and also compares unfavourably with the target of 
14.27 per cent for the full year.

Product (GDP) beginning from the next fiscal year.
    
This commitment has been made to the International Monetary Fund as

Pakistans commitment, however, is couched in a cautious language

be consistent with the security needs of the country. The current

<a name="cbrc">CBR clarifies : Advance tax also applicable to TDRs, SNDRs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aslam Sheikh

ISLAMABAD, Jan 27: The Central Board of Revenue has clarified to the 
banks that advance tax of paisa 20 per one hundred rupee is also 
applicable to what are called TDRS (term deposit receipts) and SNDRS 
(short notice deposit receipts) in banking jargon in addition to other 
financial instruments used for inland transfer of money.

Some bankers allege this levy is scaring away depositors who see in it 
a new move to subject bank deposits to harsh taxation. The new tax in 
addition to the withholding one at ten per cent on profits of such 
deposits will also discourage the drive to attract new bank deposits, 
insist some bankers.
    
A bank sources said the CBR could not come with a clear definition of 
the terminology SPECIAL DEPOSITS. In discussions that followed and 
through one of its/circulars/excluded term deposit receipts and short 
deposit receipts from the purview of new advance tax later, a source 
revealed, the earlier exclusion was reversed by the CBR and banks were 
directed that TDRS and SNDRS were also subject to the new advance tax.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 30: Exporters and top bankers clashed in the Federal 
Export Promotion Board meeting, with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 
chair on issue of exchange rate fluctuation of Pakistani rupee.
    
Exporters pleaded for due consideration to be given to the changes in 
cross rates of European and US currencies as the recent appreciation 
of the US dollar has not been reflected in the exchange rate of rupee 
by the SBP after devaluation.
    
The exporters, therefore, suggested that SBP to operate float 
management mechanism to respond quickly to the fluctuation in US 
dollar and European currency rates in determination of exchange rate 
of Pakistani rupee.

trading.
    
Other energy shares were also actively traded at the current lower and 
rose under the lead of KESC, which posted a fresh gain of Rs 3.

Adamjee Insurance added a fresh sharp gain of Rs 14 to its overnight 
rise of Rs 10.50, rising well over Rs 30. Other good gainers were led 
by Siemens Pakistan, D.G.Khan cement, National Fibre, NDLC, and PIC,

<a name="stoc">Stocks rise across broad front as investors cover positions</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Muhammad Aslam

STOCKS rose across a broad front during the preceding week. Big 
increase in the KSE 100-share index, which surged by about 100 points 
to 1,591.50 as compared to last week's 1,492.47 showed that the run-up 
is real and could be sustained during the coming sessions too.

The market firm stance and uppish leaning is also evident in a big 
fresh increase of 99.03 points in the KSE 100 share index signalling 
that its next chart point could be 1,600 points before the month is 
out.

"The current equity rates are about 30 percent lower than other 
emerging markets and provide an attractive bait for any foreign 
investor", floor brokers said.

Dealers said a big rise of well over 60 points in the index just in 
few sessions, which added Rs 9 billion to the market capitalisation at 
Rs 342 billion is not a small an achievement and speaks of qualitative 
change in the share trading.

Bulk of the support, however, remained centred around PTC vouchers, 
which were massively traded and the interesting feature was that it 
crossed the barrier of Rs 32 after several months of sluggishness.

Hub-Power followed it, rising sharply on active follow-up support and 
was traded massively.

Lucky Cement, Fauji Fertiliser and ICI Pakistan have recently joined 
the selected band of current favourites and were again heavily traded 
mostly at the higher levels.

Adamjee Insurance, which has been dormant for the last several weeks 
also burst into activity and rose sharply on news of strong foreign 
buying.

Trading volume was maintained the last week's level of 104 million 
shares bulk of which went to the credit of PTC vouchers and HubPower. 
Both were traded massively in each session on reported strong foreign 
buying. Some other MNCs also followed them under the lead of IM 
Pakistan, and Fauji Fertiliser and the Faysal Bank.

The notable feature of the week was, PTC vouchers alone accounted for 
30 million shares.

During the next week also, both theses are shares expected to lead the 
market advance and could take some other shares in the sectors along-
with them, notably in the energy sector where the newly listed Sitara 
Energy has already assumed the role of a most active scrip.

Other actively traded shares included Askari Bank, Dhan Fibre Ibrahim 
Fibre, Sub Southern, Sui Northern, Tri-Pack Films, D.G. Khan Cement, 
LTV Modaraba and Honda Atlas.

<a name="stat">State terrorism</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee

STATE terrorism: Government by intimidation and carried out by the 
party in power; a policy intended to strike with terror the people 
against whom it is adopted; the systematic use of terror or 
unpredictable violence against defenceless people. It has been 
practised by weak or authoritarian governments throughout world 
history.

Our ignorant or revengeful governments have invariably employed state 
terrorism, but never before in the history of this country has it been 
practised so systematically as is being done at present against a 
section of the populace of Karachi. People are being murdered, whilst 
in custody, by the government forces of law and order. Whatever be the 
provocation, this cannot be condoned. And, after the murders have been 
committed we are told that because of an 'incident or an 'encounter' 
the police were forced to kill. No one believes this.

The latest known massacre in custody took place on January 20. At 0500 
hours, a posse of armed police and Rangers in 35 mobiles under the 
command of Toufiq Zahid Khan, SHO of the Khawaja Ajmer Nagri police 
station and ASI Ayaz, raided and laid siege to the house of the in 
laws of Rehan Ahmed Khan in Dastagir Colony. They had no warrants, nor 
were they accompanied by women police officers. Women and children 
were subjected to search, intimidation and, in some cases, beatings. 
During the four hour siege of the area, seven men were arrested, and 
five; including Rehan, were killed. It is feared that the remaining 
two, who are still held in custody, will meet the same fate.

The senior-most Senator of the MQM, Ishtiaq Azhar, has appealed to the 
newly harnessed centre 'trotter' of the Troika, COAS General Jehangir 
Karamat, a good soldier capable of ordering those under him not to 
kill their fellow citizens. The Rangers, after all, are commanded by 
regular army officers. 'Tikkakhanish' or 'Babaric' action attract 
nothing but disgust.

State terrorism can take many forms. Murder is only one of them. 
Another form is that now being practised by Kamaluddin Azfar, Governor 
of Sindh. He creates alarm by now and then making efforts to 
destabilise the people supported organisation, the CPLC - in the 
working of which the people have great faith and trust - headed by 
volunteers Nasim Haji and Jameel Yusuf. His campaign to dislodge Nazim 
flopped. Being more loyal than the queen, he tried to get rid of Nazim 
merely because he had written a letter to the Press saying that he 
felt that under the present misrule the downfall of the country would 
come sooner than predicted by the then World Bank SVP Shahid Hussain.

Now Jameel, who supported Nazim, is the honourable Governor's target. 
False information was disseminated. It was said that the 'agencies' 
had discovered that Jameel was involved in the killing of the two 
American Consular staff members in Karachi last March. The leak, 
picked up from the Governor's mansion, was printed in Jang and Nawa-i-
Wagt on January 15. This created a stir amongst the people who have 
more faith in the CPLC than they have in the government agencies. And, 
of course, the lower ranks of the police force, highly resentful of 
the CPLC, fanned the fire.

On January 18, Jameel wrote to the Governor requesting that an 
investigation be held into the false and defamatory statement. On 
January 24, Jang carried the following front-page news item:  
"Governor Sindh has ordered the immediate dismissal of Jameel Yusuf, 
Deputy Chief of the CPLC, following reports of the involvement of his 
nephew in terrorist activities. In a letter addressed to the IGP 
Sindh, the Governor lauded the role of the CPLC in combating crime and 
stated that a person such as Jameel Yusuf is not fit to serve in a 
sensitive organisation like the CPLC, formed to help innocent people 
who are victims of crime and to eliminate criminals from our society. 
Not only have the intelligence agencies provided information on Jameel 
Yusuf, but his brother Nisar Yusuf's son has been arrested for 
harbouring terrorists and weapons. Governor of Sindh has very clearly 
emphasised that he is not removing the CPLC Deputy Chief because of 
any personal grudge. A copy of the letter addressed to the IGP has 
been sent to the Prime Minister's Secretariat and, according to 
sources there, the Prime Minister has expressed her satisfaction on 
the Governor's decision". 

Since everything that any member of the government denies is taken by 
the public as being the gospel truth, we immediately understand that 
the honourable Governor does indeed harbour a "personal grudge" 
against the chiefs of the CPLC.

Jameel's nephew was picked up by the police, interrogated, tortured 
and then released on bail. Jameel has received no intimation from 
anyone regarding his "dismissal". The IGP has received no letter from 
the Governor as reported.. The Sindh Home Secretary knows nothing 
about Jameel's dismissal. The good editor of Jang, when I spoke to 
him, said he has evidence to substantiate what his paper has printed. 
Why is Kamaluddin being so inept? He cannot even 'fix', after having 
been trained by the original 'fixer'.

Now to state terrorism in Rawalpindi, where the 'high-ups' are having 
a field day with Minoo Bhandara and his 135-year-old Muree Brewery, 
the products of which have enriched our governments enormously and 
given pleasure to many of our citizens. In October 1994, Bhandara, 
aggrieved by a government decisions, instructed his Karachi 
representative to file a petition in the Sindh High Court and he then 
went abroad. Before the representative could act, he was summoned to 
his local police station by DSP Siddiqui. He was made to stand for 
three hours. He was threatened. Unless he agreed to desist from filing 
the petition, he would be charged with 'harbouring dacoits', the book 
would be thrown at him, and he would be arrested. The terrorised man 
gave in. Bhandara returned to Pakistan, went to court, and obtained 
Supreme Court orders in his favour. Because of this, he is now being 
terrorised and harassed. The Income Tax department, the FIA, the CIA, 
and the rest of the gang, were all brought into play and his life has 
been made miserable.

In December 1995, his bottle-making plant at Hattar was closed down by 
the authorities on a putrid excuse. After much running around he 
managed to get it back into operation. Thereafter he received threats 
emanating from various 'high-up' quarters and was told that his 
brewery would be closed down. Those conveying the threats were 
apologetic, telling him they were helpless.

On January 17, without notice, armed police, under the orders of the 
Assistant Commissioner, raided his brewery, arbitrarily shut it down 
and sealed it, locking out some 300 men. Bhandara appealed to the 
Lahore High Court at Rawalpindi, where on January 22, Justice 
Allahnawaz told the AC that 'due  process' had not been followed, that 
he should review his hasty action. The AC asked for time to consult 
his 'superiors' and the case has been adjourned to January 29.

Optimistic Bhandara has now made a public appeal to the President. 
This was printed in the Islamabad edition of The Nation, under the 
heading "Muree Brewery illegally unlawfully closed." The narrative 
states: "Ostensible reason: The sealing was necessitated in the 
interest of industrial peace. Real reason: Supreme Court decisions in 
the Brewery's favour which have upset the business interests of the 
most powerful and influential person of Pakistan."

Moving to Islamabad, here also we find targets of terrorismthe judges 
of our Supreme Court. The Judges Case, which has been dragging on 
since November as it has been adjourned again and again on the request 
of the government, was fixed for hearing on January 21. That morning a 
'voice' telephoned the Registrar and informed him that a bomb had been 
planted in the Supreme Court and recommended that the building be 
evacuated.    

Consulting his brother judges, the Chief Justice disregarded the 
terroriser's call and commenced proceedings. Attorney-General Qazi 
Jameel stated he was not ready to plead, as did the lawyers engaged by 
the government, former AG Yahya Bakhtiar and the party's Cambridge 
Chaudhry, Aitzaz Ahasan, the judges were firm, sufficient leeway had 
been gives, no further adjournments would be granted.

The AG droned on for three days, until the rising of the court on 
January 23. Whilst closing, he very correctly thanked the court for 
hearing him with patience and tolerance, whereupon Justice Ajmal Mian 
was constrained to observe that he had left unanswered too many of the 
questions asked by the court.

We are desperately in need of a strong independent judiciary. Each 
man, howsoever and wheresoever he finds himself, should do his best to 
see that the goal is attained. My friend the Jadoogar, amicus curiae 
Sharifuddin, will be the last to rise and address the court in the 
Judges Case. He has been "terrorised" as has been the poor petitioner 
. Habibul Wahabul Khairi who too has suddenly received income-tax 
demands relating to his past long closed assessments. Nevertheless, it 
is hoped that the clever and indeed very competent Sharifuddin will 
redeem himself, guide the court correctly, and set us right.

<a name="poli">Political power and the judiciary</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

ARDESHIR COWASJEE has been writing about the judiciary and its plight 
for some weeks now but, I strongly suspect, without eliciting from the 
public at large the kind of interest or concern that would have been 
kindled in any other democratic society.

At the best of times the mercurial temperament of our people is such 
that they can get hysterical over trifles whereas matters of greater 
importance leave them cold and indifferent. Our past is replete with 
instances of serious agitations arising over non- issues while no one 
lost any sleep over the secession of East Pakistan. Nowadays of course 
the national capacity for indignation has been dulled by the 
realisation that in the Islamic Republic no exercise is more useless 
than the expression of outrage. When tales of corruption and plunder 
that would leave the heavens amazed have not the slightest effect on 
anyone, why should the indirect harassment of the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan make the mountains weep?
    
The bare details of this harassment, first reported by Ardeshir 
Cowasjee in his column and not convincingly rebutted by anyone in 
authority, are clear enough. In November last year a contingent of the 
Sindh police raided the house of the Chief Justice of Pakistans son-
in-law who is a superintending engineer in a government department. 
Luckily for him he was not at home. A few days later a notification 
was issued suspending him from service.
    
Such things do not happen in Pakistan just like that. In a country 
where even modest bigwigs are usually above the law, distinguished 
sons-in-law like, say, Mr Irfanullah Marwat, or distinguished fathers-
in-law such as Mr Hakim Ali Zardari enjoy an exalted status. Even if 
they do anything blameworthy no harm can come to them. In the case of 
the Chief Justices son-in-law he has not done anything which makes 
his victimisation all the more strange. What adds to the sense of 
drama in this affair is the writ filed in the Peshawar High Court by a 
lawyer with known PPP leanings challenging the appointment of the 
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, who was elevated to his present 
position over the heads of several colleagues senior to him.
    
Is the proximity of these two events a mere coincidence or are they 
links in a chain whose purpose is to punish the father-in- law for any 
sins that he may have committed? All that we know is that the Chief 
Justice has admitted for hearing the so-called judges case in which, 
to the governments visible chagrin, the merit and worth of recent 
appointments to the higher judiciary have been called into question. 
The Chief Justice certainly has not committed any impropriety in 
admitting this writ for hearing. The trouble, however, is that the 
culture of power has sunk to such low depths in this country that 
those who are in power expect even chief justices to behave like SHOs.
    
Going into the merits of the judges case would be improper because it 
is currently sub judice. But something can be said about the 
harassment directed, if only by proxy, at the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan because nothing like it has happened in this country before.
    
Not that this is the first time in Pakistan that a government has been 
unhappy with a judge. All Pakistani rulers, regardless of whether the 
form of government is a dictatorship or a democracy, have been at 
heart tinpot Mughal princes, exercising power arbitrarily and chafing 
at the bit when there has been the slightest check on their authority. 
Difficult judges, therefore, run counter to the spirit of Pakistani 
governance. The vital difference, however, is that in the past 
governments have never resorted to vulgar or bazaar tactics when 
dealing with awkward judges. They have taken care to observe some 
minimal standards of decency.
    
Ayub Khan was not particularly enamoured of Justice Kayani whose bold 
speeches in defence of civil liberties were an irritant for the 
martial law regime. But no relative of Justice Kayanis was picked up 
as a consequence on the orders of the Field Marshal or on those of the 
feared Nawab of Kalabagh who was then guiltier of West Pakistan. 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had no patience with an independent judiciary but 
he did not use police methods in order to bring it under his thumb. He 
mutilated the constitution which for all its reprehension was still a 
case of using the law rather than anything else to subvert the law. 
General Zia-ul-Haq, of course, was the master- user and abuser of the 
judiciary. When it suited his purposes no one could lay himself out 
more to flatter the lords of the higher judiciary. His purposes 
achieved, he enacted the Provisional Constitutional Order (the 
infamous PCO) which required the judges of the high courts and the 
Supreme Court to take a fresh oath of loyalty to a dispensation which 
had stripped them of their constitutional powers.
    
That this was a humiliation which he was visiting upon the judiciary  
the same judiciary which had earlier subscribed to the wisdom of 
necessity  was obvious enough. But, if anything, it was a 
metaphysical humiliation. The ISI did not go rounding up individual 
judges.
    
In any case, what is sauce for a military government should not be 
sauce for a government which never tires of proclaiming its adherence 
to the finest tenets of democracy. Where this government should have 
prided itself on strengthening the judiciary it has done what has lain 
in its power to weaken it. Three of the four high courts are still 
without permanent chief justices. Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid was 
transferred from the chief justiceship of Sindh to the Federal Shariat 
Court because his liberal ways sat uncomfortably with the governments 
prejudices. The criteria adopted for the appointment of fresh high 
court judges (the subject matter of the writ currently being heard in 
the Supreme Court) were such as to generate a country- wide 
controversy.
    
But to crown this distinguished record comes the crude harassment of 
the Chief Judge of Pakistan. To harass my daughter is to harass me. To 
harass the Chief Justices daughter is to harass the Chief Justice. 
Greater than the distinction of presiding over a system of corruption 
and mal-administration that has no parallel in the nations history is 
the audacity which informs this undertaking. 
   
A government capable of this is capable of anything. And in proving 
itself so capable it has reduced not only itself. It has diminished 
the dignity of the state as well because a country whose chief justice 
can be so harassed is a country where the last props of decency are in 
danger of falling away. Let us forswear the nonsense of wanting to 
join the ranks of the Asian tigers. The rate at which we are 
destroying the traditions and institutions necessary for a society 
based on order and justice, we should rather be dreading the example 
of those African countries which are headed towards anarchy.
    
None of this is to suggest that we should fool ourselves about our 
superior judiciary. If ever its history is written it will not be 
written in characters of gold. But this aspect of the matter aside, 
the fact remains that if I as a citizen of Pakistan have any 
fundamental rights these are guaranteed not by GHQ or the FIA but by 
the constitution whose custodian the judiciary is. If my fundamental 
rights are violated, the only door I can knock at is that of the 
judiciary. A strong judiciary is thus a check on the Mughal tendency 
which shapes the spirit of governance in Pakistan. By the same token 
an attack on the judiciary, or the person who sits at its apex, is an 
attack on the fundamental rights of every citizen of Pakistan.
    
So portentous a matter if you think closely about it. And yet so small 
the outrage it has occasioned. The reason for this no doubt lies in 
the impoverishment of our public morality. So inured have we become to 
scandals and shenanigans that nothing amazes us anymore. 
   
Not even such priceless news as the reported offer of Ms Bhutto to 
make Senator Jehangir Badr the chief justice of Pakistan. No doubt 
this offer (at a gathering of the party faithful) was made in jest. 
But then it is a measure of the steep road down which we have 
travelled that some years ago no Pakistani ruler would have had so 
complete a lack of culture as to utter a joke in such poor taste.

<a name="paki">Pakistan: no cause for dismay</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Irshad Ullah Khan

THE greatest liberty we have is in knowing that everything dies in our 
universe. This thought equalises all. The mega-sun to the smallest of 
stars. The super-human to the disabled wanderer in the streets.
    
Political systems as such are logical only till they serve the people. 
The collapse of the Soviet Union was the result of a system that had 
stopped serving the very people for whom it had been so closely 
designed. Now whether the present system in Russia can survive also 
depends upon its fulfilling the dreams of the people, or shall we put 
it better, by meeting the needs of the people.
    
The purpose of this article is not to discuss in detail the dying of 
systems or why they die. Nor does it aim at establishing a theory of 
developing systems that never die. The purpose here is to discuss 
briefly that mega-guerilla war, the Afghan event, that largely shaped 
our relationship with the United States of America and so dominated 
the politics of this region while it lasted.
    
The aim of this war, as far as the United States was concerned, was 
only one: to bleed the Soviet Union to death financially and divert 
its vast energies to an un winnable war so that its agriculture, its 
industry and its capacity to look after the every-day needs of its 
people would come to an end. Who were to be the warriors? Who were to 
be the front-line managers acting for the superpower? In this the 
United States found Pakistan a ready ally and the Afghan people 
wonderful warriors. It did not have to worry about any problem 
directly affecting it. No body bags to be sent home. Here at the end 
of the century lived two nations who could put forward the idealism of 
Islam before them and so battle without fear for life. What wonderful 
allies to have?
    
The system then set its sights. The Afghans were vulnerable from the 
skies. They could take on a tank with a vintage 303 rifle if 
necessary. But then this bravado was self-defeating. With modern 
weapons, these tigers of men could take on anyone. The Stinger missile 
was a great gift. It turned the tide of battle. Now the helicopters 
with their sights trained on moving men and signs of smoke hinting of 
men around a hastily prepared meal were vintage compared to the swift 
and deadly outcome of a single stinger burst.
    
The question now was: how long could the Soviet Union continue to lose 
its aircraft and have the ability left to reinforce its ground troops? 
Many other weapons were introduced by the United States but the 
Stinger continued to be the dominant one.
    
With bodybags flying home and public opinion building up against a 
war-drenched faltering economy, the tide of battle for the Soviets 
began to change. It was now only a question of when. It came swiftly 
with the Soviet Union withdrawing. They could have used their awesome 
power to win.
    
They could have flattened Afghanistan and Pakistan with atomic 
reprisals. But the great Soviet spirit born of music and literature 
and the arts could not countenance such destruction. So it withdrew 
from death, hoping that life would grow where it left. It was a 
similar event as the American withdrawal from Vietnam.
    
What were we left with after this war? Hordes of drug-addicts and the 
Kalashinkov culture in Pakistan. A nation that concentrated so 
savagely on the Afghan war that it forgot to educate its own people, 
to feed them properly and to provide medical facilities for them. Our 
system of governance had collapsed in this period of the Afghan war. 
In Afghanistan we have a nation of largely divided Afghans so 
paranoically engaged in fighting each other that they cannot agree on 
a common formula for peace or on an interim arrangement for 
governance.
    
It is not only the Soviet Union that lost this war. Both Pakistan and 
Afghanistan have lost the victory they thought they had won.
    
Does this diminish Pakistans geographic and political importance in 
this region? Are we still chasing the illusion of a holy war?
    
On one side we have India which seeks to compete with the United 
States as a superpower. Its military budget and research into new 
weaponry are aimed at challenging the lead of the United States in 
this field. The new Indian missiles and their advances in radar 
research in some cases are ahead of United States technology. Their 
advances in industry and their ability to sell consumer items from 
airconditioners, refrigerators, washing machines to cars and power 
systems at half the price of those produced in the United States 
threaten the very economy of the United States.
     
India with its eight hundred million-odd population can afford to 
slash its prices and challenge the productivity and competitiveness of 
the United States in the world markets.
    
On the other side of Pakistan we have nations which are determined to 
bring the long-awaited renaissance of Islamic thought and ideology to 
fruition.
    
For the United States the Indian option and the Islamic option pose 
equal dangers. The first threatens its economic life and the second 
confronts its spiritual ideals. Both are interlinked and in time 
thrive on each other. Therefore, in Pakistan we should not worry too 
much on our being isolated in a world where mainly Machiavellian self 
interests matter. We are the buffer state. A country where people are 
largely forgiving and moderate. A nation that bears its religion in 
its soul and not on the sharp edges of its weapons.
    
On us depends the future of this subcontinent and the intellectual and 
moral influences that will determine the idealism of Islam in the 
region. We have our borders touching or close to those of the new 
independent states of the former Soviet Union. A lot on how they react 
will depend upon how we act. We can become the Switzerland or 
Singapore of this region. We have vast resources as yet untapped. A 
buffer state yes but what a buffer state! With a long coastline and 
rich plains and deserts and mountains that promise crops, and oil and 
gas, and vast minerals, and men and women capable of reaching the 
greatest heights  we are in an ideal situation to bargain for our own 
prosperity in a world where there are no permanent friends.

<a name="blan">Blandishments for victory</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

SPORT was supposed to be not a question of winning at all costs but of 
playing the game well. Defeat and victory were unimportant as long as 
you had put in your best and had conducted yourself fairly. 
Admittedly, in the world of professional sport, where sport is a 
thriving industry rather than anything that the ancient Greeks would 
recognise, this sounds like a quaint notion. Modern sport is a 
fiercely competitive business in which the biggest rewards are for 
winning. But even against this inevitable backdrop, the incentives for 
the Pakistan cricket team announced by Mr Asif Ali Zardari, who heads 
the committee looking after the arrangements for the World Cup, are 
breathtakingly materialistic. If our team wins the cup, he has 
declared, every player will get a residential plot in Islamabad and 
his share of Rs five million which will be distributed amongst the 
team. If this be the price of modern sport, then there is something 
terribly wrong with it.

There is no question about it that as a nation we need to do more to 
encourage every kind of, sportfrom cricket, hockey and athletics to 
kabaddi and wrestling. For a nation of a hundred and twenty or thirty 
million souls our impact on the world sporting scene is so pathetic as 
to be almost an affront to our national pride. But the way to 
encourage sport is not to hold a bunch of carrots before a squad of 
men who only understand the language of money but to nourish and train 
our young and to spend a trifle more than we do on setting up new 
sporting facilities throughout the country. The Pakistan cricket team, 
as indeed any other Pakistan team, should be putting in its best as a 
matter of course and as a matter of personal pride and not because of 
the prospect of residential plots or heaps of money. There is, of 
course, an element of big money in sport nowadays because of the 
sponsorship of private companies. To get such sponsorship is every 
sportsperson's privilege. But between this and the blatant incentives 
announced by Mr Zardari there is a world of difference. Certainly 
sportsmen should not get a shabby deal. They must get the best 
facilities and be looked after properly. But if they are inspired to 
stretch their capabilities only by the prospect of profit and other 
benefits, then they are doing no service to their game or to the 
nation which exults in their victories and is cast down by their 
defeats.    

As the hosts of the World Cup we should be putting our best foot 
forward: cleaning up our cities, improving our transport facilities 
and ensuring that a check, even if a temporary one, is kept on the 
indiscipline which is so much a part of our national character. These 
are the things that we should be concentrating on. As for our 
cricketers, we should be expecting them to take their training 
seriously and to take their minds off the jealousies and the intrigues 
which have reduced them from cricketing champions to cricketing 
bumpkins. But they should be doing this for the joy of competing,-for 
the thrill of playing before their own people and for the pure 
pleasure that a well-deserved victory brings and not for any plots in 
Islamabad promised to them by Mr Zardari.

<a name="livi">Living up to commitments to IMF</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed

ELABORATE details of the binding commitments to the IMF in the fiscal, 
monetary and overall macro-economic sector have been published which 
makes pretty chilly reading. They have not been released for 
publication by the government but by city newspapers, as was the case 
with the details of the ESAF. The government entered into rigid and 
varied commitments to obtain a stand-by arrangement of 600 million 
dollars for 15 months beginning from December last in place of the 
scraped Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility over three yeas to get 
1.5 billion dollars from the IMF.
    
Publishing details of commitments with foreign countries or major 
multilateral donor agencies has not been part of our tradition as that 
can be too embarrassing and can give rise to heated controversies.
    
The detailed commitments now entered into are subject to continuous 
monitoring and inspection by periodic visits of IMF missions, like the 
one which has already arrived on a fortnight visit, prior to giving 
150 million dollars more following the 200 million already provided. 
The commitments may seem a violation of Pakistans economic 
sovereignty to the unwary, but they are more like the commitments 
undertaken by Pakistan for the 1.5 billion ESAF deal violated by the 
current years budget, the excessive bank borrowing of the government 
and other deviation and not very different from the agreements with 
IMF over the last 20 years, but are more detailed, and subject to 
greater scrutiny and swifter punishment.
    
These conditionalities are not far different from what a prudent 
private sector banker would come up with when lending to a profligate 
borrower, except in the case of the private sector deals the bank can 
foreclose on the assets mortgaged, and the IMF cant do that with 
sovereign nations.
    
The new commitments show the kind of price the country has to pay for 
its financial folly, and economic lapses, of over decades of 
government spending far beyond their means, with large administrations 
from top to bottom doing so little for the good of the people or 
economic growth of the country. They spared the agricultural rich from 
taxation and developed a fiscal system in which excessive cumulative 
taxation in some areas co-exist with excessive corruption in the 
taxation machinery. Along with that, high economic growth targets were 
followed by poor performance and yet the official efforts have been to 
sustain a phoney euphoria instead of getting down to doing first 
things first in a heavily populated poor country with a high 
population growth of 3 per cent and markedly high expectations, but 
poor per capita income growth.
    
The importance of the IMF as the worlds monetary agency to Pakistan 
does not lie in the volume of money it lends at very low interest 
rates, but the chit of economic health from it necessary to get a fair 
deal from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other donors, 
including Japan, Pakistans largest aid-giver following the fading out 
of the US in this area. Without such a chit Pakistan will find 
borrowing from world currency markets on short term difficult and 
foreign investors on whom we are depending excessively now will not be 
excited about coming to Pakistan.
    
This does not mean the IMF is always right and it does not give 
contradictory advice and come up with self-defeating programmes in 
developing countries and that it does not have the same kind of 
economic pills to prescribe for various economic ills of developing 
countries quite different from each other. But after mismanaging their 
economies for long due to bad politics and worse administrations, 
countries like Pakistan have hardly any other option, save increasing 
self reliance.
    
Over the years the officials who had negotiated various deals with the 
IMF had argued that if the going got too tough they could always 
deviate or resile from some of the commitments, while paying homage to 
the whole package. Hence the IMF has been tightening the screws more 
and more and sending more inspection teams to Pakistan.
    
Will that happen again now? The government has agreed to raise the 
value of the Produce Index Unit (PIU) for wealth tax purposes from Rs 
250 (it was raised from Rs 200 this year) to Rs 400, and include farm 
machinery cars and farm houses as assets for tax purposes. The 
farmlords had resented all such moves in the past. Will they fall in 
line now after they have failed even the Ushr collection totally? And 
can the government compel them?
    
At the other end a hefty turnover tax of two per cent is to be levied 
on cottage industry. The small scale sector which has been growing at 
a steady 8.2 per cent annually despite small assistance from the 
government and very little of bank loans will resent this tax, and 
collecting the full revenues may be too difficult.
    
Industry and consumers in general will welcome reduction of import 
duties to an average of 50 to 55 per cent from July 1 after scraping 
the 10 per cent regulatory duty levied by the mini-budget. But what is 
given through reduction in import duties may be taken away by the 
General Sales Tax which is to be converted into the Value Added Tax 
(VAT) at the manufacturing and import stage. Exemptions from GST are 
to be done away with, except for a few basic items like food stuff, 
fertilisers and pesticides, and all exemptions which are a part of tax 
packages to a sector or region have to go. And GST is to be extended 
to the capital goods along with immediate refund of unused tax credit. 
All industries under capacity tax schemes will be brought under the 
regulatory GST regime when the capacity tax schemes expire.
    
At the other end the government has agreed there will be no salary 
increases in the next budget despite the 13 per cent inflation 
officially and far higher actually? Government employees are already 
too restive and have been campaigning for higher salaries. Can the 
government ask them to lie low for another year?
    
The IMF talks of lowering the inflation from the current persistent 
13 per cent and the government talks of bringing it down to a single 
digit to meet the 9 per cent target earlier set for the current year. 
How can that be achieved when the farmers are pressing for higher 
support prices, and right now sugar cane growers are not content with 
even Rs 27 per 40 kg at which the sugar mills are buying cane in Sindh 
instead of the officially fixed Rs 21.75, and are insisting on Rs 35 
to Rs 40 as Punjab cane-growers are demanding. 
   
Now if they have to pay wealth tax at Rs 400 per PIU and let the 
agricultural machinery, cars and farm houses also to be taxed, they 
will demand for higher farm prices. If along with that, higher or more 
widespread VAT is to neutralise the reduction in import duties, and 
the additional taxation of 1.4 per cent of the GST to be levied by the 
next budget raises about Rs 30 billion more as taxes, the volume of 
bank credit to producing units is to be reduced and interest rates are 
to remain at their peak, how can inflation come down?
    
Meanwhile, the government has gone on a wild bank borrowing spree, and 
instead of the target of Rs 28.1 billion set for the whole year and Rs 
18.24 billion borrowed in the same six months last year, it has 
borrowed Rs 41.2 billion in the first half of the financial year. The 
borrowing has come down from its peak of Rs 55 billion earlier, but 
that is small relief. If the government is going to use so much of the 
credit at a time when State Bank of Pakistan is restricting credit as 
a whole excessively in its efforts to bring down inflation, what 
chance has the producing sectors to get adequate credit and at 
reasonable rates?
    
The IMF also wants the defence spending to be brought down next year 
below the 5.3 per cent of the GDP committed this year. Will the 
government really honour this commitment at a time of increasing 
tension between India and Pakistan, or will other sectors be asked to 
share some of the defence burdens?
    
Along with that all, the commitment is to bring down the budget 
deficit in the second half of this financial year to 4 per cent so 
that along with the higher deficit in the first half of the year the 
total will be 4.6 per cent for the whole year compared to 5.6 per cent 
last year. That means the governments spending has to shrink a great 
deal, and all lavishness on its part at the higher levels along with 
it costly ceremonies or phoney carnivals have to go. Will they? The 
trend is not in that direction.
    
The economic growth rate which was earlier targeted at 6.5 percent is 
to come down to 5.6 percent this year despite the vastly improved 
cotton crop and an expected good wheat crop. Evidently if the growth 
is to be less the official spending, too, must be less and efforts to 
collect larger revenues must focus on reducing, if not eliminating, 
the vast corruption in the taxation services, beginning with the 
Customs. Pre-shipment inspection by two foreign companies may help 
reduce tax evasion by regular importers, but cannot stop the vast 
customs-aided smuggling, like the plane-load of whisky bottles flown 
in from the Gulf and promptly cleared by the Customs.

After such rigid and vast commitments, the people would like to see 
how much of that is honoured or whether the old deviations will be 
repeated again, and if all that would bring additional hardships, how 
much of that will be shared by the ruling rich with their varied 
privileges and vast exemptions.

<a name="reco">Recognition at last?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

ARE we as a nation beginning to recognise the greatness of our science 
Nobel laureate, Professor Abus Salam? It was heartening to observe 
that Dr Salam's seventieth birthday was celebrated nationally on 
January 29 and his services to science duly eulogised (This was in 
marked contrast to his sixtieth birthday, ten years ago, when no 
notice was taken of the event) Whether this belated recognition will 
give our leading scientist any satisfaction in the twilight of his 
life when ill health robbed him of his capacity to play an active role 
is difficult to say. But the fact is that since he won the Nobel Prize 
for Physics in 1979 Prof Salam has received more acclaim 
internationally than in his home country. He has won 20 prestigious 
international awards and has received honorary doctorates from 36 
universities from all over the world.

True, the Pakistan government did confer Nishan-i-Imtiaz on him in 
1979 and the Quaid-i-Azam University awarded him an honorary 
doctorate. But that was about all that we did in honouring illustrious 
son-of Pakistan. What is more discouraging is the cavalier treatment 
meted out to Prof  Salam in this country. He has not been given the 
welcome he deserved as our science hero. Worse still, his repeated 
efforts to give a boost to science in Pakistan have been coldly 
spurned. His exhortations to the successive governments to promote 
science education and research in the universities and other 
institutions, too have fallen on deaf ears. Nothing could be a bigger 
insult to a scientist who is a giant in his field. Earlier, he at 
least enjoyed an important status in his different capacities as 
scientific adviser to the president member of the National Science 
Council, Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission and the Pakistan Science 
Foundation. But since 1975 he has been cold-shouldered, not 
considering it necessary to involve him in policy planning on science 
and education. The loss  is ours and not Dr. Salam's, for his talent 
and experience as a leading light of science have been amply regarded 
and harnessed elsewhere in the world.

Whatever the, reason, one thing is plain. The authorities in 
Islamabad, irrespective of whoever has been at the helm at a given 
time, have never welcomed advice from any quarter to spruce up its 
approach to science. Small wonder then that Pakistan is way down the 
scale in the world of science. It has only 71 scientists per million 
population as compared to  India's 147 and less than 10 percent of 
them are engaged in research when other countries have as many as 55 
percent of their scientists conducting research. This is not 
surprising in view of the de-emphasis on education generally and 
science particularly. Thus, only 0.5 percent of the GNP is allocated 
to science in Pakistan when UNESCO has recommended two percent for 
this purpose. Prof Salam has on several occasions lamented this sorry 
state of affairs and suggested ways and means of rectifying these 
weaknesses in our system. If Pakistan ready wishes to pay a tribute to 
its Nobel laureate, it must put its acts together and ginger up its 
performance in the field of scientific education and research.</pre><hr><pre>

KARACHI, Jan 26: The sixth World Cups mascot was officially launched 
in a hurriedly called ceremony at a local hotel.

The mascot, called `Googlee, was displayed by Chief Executive of the 
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Arif Abbasi. Also present on the 
presentation was Mohammad Tahir Memon, representative of the Pakistan 
Tobacco Company (PTC), the sister organisation of Indian Tobacco 
Company (ITC) who are the sponsors of the World Cup.
    
The description of the mascot is something like this:
    
A cricket ball is wearing the helmet. Hands and legs emerge from the 
ball which are equipped with protection guards and the bat in his left 
hand. The ball, no doubts, appears, perhaps singing the theme which 
is: Share the Magic.
    
Googlee was conceptualised and designed by Hindustan Thompson 
Associates (HTA), Calcutta, and the final choice was made from a host 
of options.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

LAHORE, Jan 29: Each of the 21 members of the Pakistan team (including 
the four reserves and three officials) has been promised a lucrative 
package of incentives by the World Cup Committee Chairman Asif Ali 
Zardari (MNA).

Asif Ali Zardari said that if the Pakistan team succeeded in retaining 
the title, every  member will be given Rs 50,000, a plot of 500 yards 
each. He promised that the multi-national companies will be requested 
to sponsor all the members of the squad for ten years. He said that 
the incentives were being offered not only to make the future of the 
present lot of cricketers secure but also to lure the youth of the 
country to take to sports to build a healthier nation.

Zardari said national prestige will be enhanced by successfully 
hosting the sixth World Cup Cricket Tournament. The money earned by 
the World Cup Committee will be spent on publicity abroad for raising 
the image of Pakistan as a liberal country having rich cultural 
heritage.

<a name="ptvp">PTV-PCB controversy re-emerges</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, Jan 27: There is no urgency in resolving the PTV-PCB row 
over coverage of domestic cricket in the country. However, the matter 
has created doubts between the two organisations prior to the World 
Cricket Cup commencing on Feb. 14 in the sub-continent.

It has been learnt that the rekindled rift involves a part of the 
agreement concerning the 50 minute recorded highlights of the domestic 
matches. There is no disagreement on the live coverage of the domestic 
cricket games between local teams which Pakistan Television network 
can televise free of cost. However, controversy re-emerged following 
differences in the agreement on the recording of the 50 minute 
highlights in which in addition to a payment of US $ 50,000, five 
minute commercials are also to be provided by the cricket board to 
PTV.

It is learnt that while PCB wants to pay the amount it was backing out 
over the five minute commercial point, the Pakistan Cricket Board 
already hired a TWI producer, Mark Lynch, based in Bombay to produce 
the highlights for the  network. The highlights were also to be 
televised on the satellite.

Speaking on terms of anonymity, an official of PTV said  that the 
 five minute commercials mean a lot of revenue to the corporation. 
However he said the amount cannot be disclosed at the moment. He 
accused the cricket board of working for the interests of TWI, the 
televising wing of IMG to whom the domestic cricket coverage rights 
have been sold. The PTV has been taken as a scapegoat here, the 
official said.

The official said  that the PTV is watching the situation closely 
although there is no urgency to resolve the issue which is of lesser 
importance considering the World Cup is just round the corner. 
However, he added that the PCB handling has created `bad faith 
between the two organisations since the two will be jointly working to 
produce the competition to the millions of viewers and cricket fans in 
Pakistan.

The controversy over coverage of domestic cricket involving local 
teams was settled him the PCB chief executive obliged a no objection 
to the Pakistan Television network on Jan 16 after PTV had stayed away 
from the two semi-finals of the National One-dayer. But, three days 
later, when the final of the National One-day Cricket Tournament 
between PIA  and Rawalpindi-A was being televised live from 
Shiekhupura, the rift was rekindled.

Apparently, the PCB chief executive decided to withdraw the no 
objection on 19 and followed it up with a letter to MD PTV on 20th 
stating that he was under the impression that the document  was in 
accordance with the agreement forwarded by TWI. It was stated that PTV 
authorities has kept the document intact and will not be interested in 
giving it back as requested unless negotiations are held to see what 
agreement can be reached.

The cricket board views that it is not entitled to sign an agreement 
with PTV over the domestic coverage, once the rights have been sold to 
IMG, herefore the national network should sign an agreement with the 
company. The PTV officials had stated that since the coverage rights 
have been sold to IMG, they feared of being sued by the company 
through international court.

Pakistan television has paid an enormous amount of US $750 to WorldTel 
to cover World Cup matches in Pakistan after PCB sold sole rights of 
World Cup coverage to the American company. A total of 17 world cup 
games will be played in Pakistan at different centres, with the 
opening fixture between UAE-South Africa at Rawalpindi on Feb. 15 and 
the final being at Lahore on March 17.

It is not known how much PCB has received by selling the coverage 
rights to WorldTel and Grand Slam, the two companies responsible for 
the World Cup coverage. The Pakistan Television (PTV) has been 
assigned to play a vital role in the forthcoming World Cup, as its 
cameramen, producers and engineers will be jointly working to televise 
the World Cup fixtures. PTV will also be catering to cricket 
commentary in the 16 fixtures to be held here. Besides, the big 
cultural extravaganza will be also be covered by  the national 
network.

<a name="tvro">TV row continues to cloud World Cup</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

NEW DELHI, Jan 29: With the World Cup less than a fortnight away, it 
is still uncertain whether audiences around the world will be able to 
watch live television coverage of the mega-event.

The bone of contention is the ongoing row over TV rights, which shows 
no signs of being resolved. Indias state-run Doordarshan network has 
gone to court over the organisers decision to cancel its contract for 
exclusive satellite rights because of a financial dispute and award 
them to the pan-Asian network STAR TV.

When the Delhi High Court passes judgement on the case this week, it 
is almost certain that the losing party will appeal to the Supreme 
Court, further delaying a final decision on the contentious issue.

A big question mark also hangs over whether the Indian government will 
allow the London-based Grand Slam company, the official TV producers 
of the World Cup, to beam Indias 17 matches live around the world.

India prohibits foreign TV companies from uplinking with satellites 
from its soil for security reasons, and World Cup officials fear the 
government may deny permission if Doordarshans rights are not 
restored.

An Indian politician added a touch of intrigue to the issue earlier 
this month by granting uplinking facilities to Grand Slam in his 
capacity as a cabinet minister, despite Doordarshans objections.

Madhavrao Scindia, who heads the World Cup organising committee, gave 
the permission shortly before he resigned from the government on 
corruption charges.

Cricket officials are unsure if Scindias go-ahead would hold after 
his resignation, and are contemplating legal action against the 
government if the permission to uplink was refused.

Co-hosts Pakistan and Sri Lanka, who have received uplinking 
permission from their respective governments, have already offered to 
take Indias 17 matches, including the two semi-finals.

If the TV row was not resolved. You cant have a World Cup if the 
matches are not shown live on television, a Pakistani cricket 
official said. If India cant solve its problems, we are ready to 
step in.

PILCOM has sold the rights to various networks around the world, and 
going back on those deals will cost us heavily, he said. Observers 
here believe one way out of the impasse was an out-of-court settlement 
in which both Doordarshan and STAR are allowed to telecast the 
tournament.

The World Cup, crickets premier limited-overs contest, runs from 
February 11 to March 17. Pakistan will host 16 matches, including the 
final at Lahore, while Sri Lanka will hold four league games.
