<a name="twop">Two PPP leaders among seven shot dead</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI: Terrorists gunned down seven people in separate incidents 
bringing the weeks death toll to 46. An MQM activist, a police 
constable and two PPP leaders were among those murdered. Seven 
vehicles were also set ablaze in various parts of the city.

A young MQM activist was killed in an alleged encounter in  Orangi 
Extension. The victim was identified as Mohammad Shamim. In another 
incident a MQM activist Mustafa Kamal, his younger brother and a 
friend Shamsher Ali Khan were arrested by the rangers during raids in 
the city.

MQM feared for safety of the three and alleged they were given a 
severe beating soon after their arrest. 

Two PPP leaders were also murdered and another was wounded when MQM 
men allegedly dragged them out of their North Karachi houses and 
sprayed them with bullets.

The murder of two local PPP activists was strongly condemned by the 
provincial government and party leadership which termed it a 
conspiracy to scuttle peace efforts.

The city people also witnessed the Haqiqi activists allegedly setting 
ablaze five minibuses as their conductors were found charging 
passengers the newly-approved government fares.
   
Three minibuses were torched in Liaquatabad and one each in Nazimabad 
and Korangi.

<a name="vict">Victims father had already moved SHC for his release</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 4: Nineteen days before his sons death in what the 
police said was an encounter, the father of an MQM activist had filed 
a petition in the Sindh High Court, seeking the release of his son, 
who he claimed, was in the illegal custody of rangers and police.
    
Mohammad Nasim alias Charya, an MQM worker, died in an encounter with 
rangers in Gharibabad on Jan 2. Three other party workers also died 
with him.
    
The police claimed that all the four had been allegedly involved in 
the kidnapping and killing of four army and police personnel in the 
early morning of Jan 1 and were allegedly members of an MQM militant 
group headed by Naeem Sherri.
    
But father Haji Ahmed Din, claimed that on Dec. 14 he filed a petition 
in the Sindh High Court, seeking the release of his son from the 
illegal custody of rangers and police.
    
Mohammad Nasim, the family claimed had been arrested on Dec. 11. The 
family claimed that rangers had arrested Nasim along with two other 
MQM workers  Syed Nasir Ali alias Bilal and Aneesuddin. It claimed 
that the rangers had killed Syed Nasir Ali on the same day and 
arrested Nasim and Aneesuddin.
    
However, on that day, the police claimed that a terrorist, Nasir Ali, 
was killed during a gunbattle with rangers. Ranger Khalid Mehmood, 
they claimed, was also wounded. A pistol and some bullets were found 
on him.
    
The police did not mention the arrest of anyone and had claimed that 
Nasirs companion escaped from the scene.
    
On Thursday, a family member showed Dawn the copy of a petition (No 
2445 of 1995) which was filed in the Sindh High Court mentioning the 
circumstances in which Nasim was arrested.
    
The family of Aneesuddin who was also arrested along with Nasim also 
filed a similar petition (No 2442 of 1995) in the Sindh High Court 
praying for his release.
    
A couple of days back, the Garden police admitted that they had 
arrested Aneesuddin after an encounter in the area.
    
After the petition, the court issued notices to the advocate-general 
and other concerned authorities on December 18 and fixed the hearing 
date on Jan 15.
    
But in the morning of Jan 2, Haji Ahmed Din learnt through newspapers 
that his son had been killed along with three other MQM workers while 
fighting with rangers in Gharibabad during a house-to-house search.
    
The operation was launched a day after police had found the bodies of 
four army and police personnel who were kidnapped and killed in the 
area.
    
The claims made by the Orangi neighbours of three other MQM activists 
who died in an encounter with Nasim has further deepened the mystery 
about the entire encounter.
    
Some of the neighbours contacted by Dawn had claimed that Mohammad 
Salim, Shabbir and Akram Khan were in rangers custody since December.
    
After the encounter, the rangers did not allow newsmen to visit the 
spot where the gunbattle had taken place. Even the police were unaware 
of the actual spot where the encounter had take place.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 4: The MQM has claimed that prison authorities are not 
bringing opposition leader Dr Farooq Sattar and at least 100 other 
party workers to courts to face trial.
    
Criticising the government, he alleged that the prison authorities 
were deliberately not producing MQM workers in courts and urged the 
judiciary to take notice of it.
    
Dr Sattar, he said, was facing 85 cases but for the last 100 days he 
had not been produced in court even in a single case.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 4: An MQM strike, staged in protest against what it 
called the extra-judicial murder of four of its workers, paralysed the 
citys economic and business activities.
    
As a whole, the city remained peaceful except for some stray incidents 
of violence in which MQM militants exchanged gunfire with rangers and 
police in Liaquatabad, fired on a circular train and set a private 
vehicle ablaze. Five people, including two women, were wounded in 
shooting incidents.

<a name="mqmc">MQM chief demands case against rangers</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Jan 6: The MQM leader Altaf Hussain has demanded that the 
director general of the rangers and other officials responsible for 
the death of four MQM workers in a recent fake encounter should be 
charged with their murder and dealt with according to the law. He made 
this demand to the chief of army staff. Mr Hussain said that there was 
no doubt that the four man - Naseem, Akram, Saleem and Shabbir - were 
arrested in December.
    
He alleged that these men were in custody since their arrest by the 
rangers, and were killed in a faked encounter. This is a clear case of 
murder the responsibility for which lies with the Prime Minister, the 
Sindh governor and Chief minister, the interior minister and the 
rangers. He appealed to the Supreme Court of Pakistan to take 
cognisance of the crime and register a case against the said persons. 
The COAS, said Mr Hussain, should take action against the DG of the 
rangers and other officials responsible for the act.
    
Mr Hussain said it was being claimed by the rangers that these men 
were involved in the killing on Jan 1 of several officials even though 
the fact is that they had been under custody since December 11. It is 
also necessary to investigate who were the real killers of the 
officials on Jan 1. It is possible, he added, that the killings were 
the result of some infighting for which MQM workers are being held 
responsible. He pointed out that the rangers have set up more than two 
dozen torture cells in Karachi where numerous Mohajirs are detained, 
tortured, then many are later killed in faked encounters. He said all 
those under detention have their lives in danger and demanded their 
immediate release otherwise they would be killed like the four MQM 
workers who were murdered on January 2.

<a name="govt">Govt for independent judiciary, says PM</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

JACOBABAD, Jan 04,: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto declared that her 
government is committed to an independent judiciary. She said the 
constitution does not provide for the judiciary to amend the law. To 
amend the law, recourse has to be taken to Parliament.
    
 We believe that power cannot be exercised without responsibility and 
there cannot be responsibility without accountability. The premier 
stated that in our constitution, the Parliament is the supreme body to 
make laws. Members of Parliament are accountable in the court of the 
people.
    
She said Pakistans longest period of Martial Law lasted over nine 
years from July 05, 1977 to December 29, 1985. Gen. Zia got himself 
elected as President by a referendum held in December 1984 where 
barely seven per cent of the people voted.
    
The Premier said elections to National and provincial assemblies were 
held in early 1985. Again the non-party elections were totally illegal 
and against the clear cut provisions of the constitution. This 
unrepresentative and unconstitutional assembly enacted the 8th 
Amendment moving the country backward to the constitution of 1956 
which is the root cause of political instability in the country.
    
She said 8th Amendment permitted the usurper to combine the office of 
COAS and the President contrary to the provisions of all previous 
constitutions which provided that the President could not hold any 
other office of profit.
    
The Amendment also indemnified all cruel and horrible punishments and 
ratified reactionary laws introduced by Zia. She said that political 
groups have used in our history, the President, the armed forces and 
the judiciary to fulfil their own unrepresentative agendas.
    
She said that political stability does not depend on the government 
alone, political stability depends upon the President, the parliament, 
the judiciary, the armed forces, the provinces, the opposition and 
other organs of the State fulfilling their constitutional obligations.
    
Prime Minister Bhutto said that if today there is poverty and 
backwardness in Pakistan, we must blame all those who violated their 
constitutional oath, exceeded their constitutional duties and power 
and sought to do what they were not supposed to do.

<a name="mqmw">MQM worker dies in CIA custody</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 9: A 35-year-old MQM worker died in the custody of CIA 
police.
    
The body of Abdul Rasheed, son of Abdul Majid, a resident of Ranchhore 
Line, was brought to the Jinnah Hospital morgue for post-mortem.
    
Inquiries made by Dawn showed that Rasheed Ahmed, who had been in the 
custody of CIA police for the last several days, had fallen 
unconscious on Monday evening owing to excessive torture during 
interrogation.
    
A CIA police party, posing themselves as his relatives, took him to 
the Mideast Hospital in Clifton and told doctors that he had met with 
an accident in his house after a quarrel with his wife. His condition 
was worsening. He was gasping for breath. We asked his relatives (CIA 
men) to take him to the Jinnah Hospital as we didnt admit such cases 
but they insisted on his being treated. Shortly afterwards he died, 
said a doctor.
    
There were torture marks on his back and he was in a very bad 
condition when brought to the hospital. His relatives insisted that 
he had met with an accident in the house but did not tell us of all 
the details. They said it was a family affair and we should treat him 
quietly, said another doctor who was on duty in the hospital 
emergency that night.
    
Despite repeated calls, the concerned CIA Civil Lines staff were not 
available for their comments. During the first half of the day, the 
staff were busy attending a high-level meeting.
    
After the meeting, they left their offices to conduct raids in the 
city and were not available till late Tuesday night. A spokesman for 
the Karachi police, however, claimed that Abdul Rasheed was arrested 
on Monday in Ranchhore Line by the CIA police in connection with a 
murder case and on the same evening his condition had worsened. He 
said: Sub-Inspector Javed Afridi of CIA Civil Lines Police took him 
to the Civil Hospital for treatment. After that he was brought back to 
the CIA Centre where he again complained about anxiety. 

On his request, he, with his mother and brother Muhammad Shahid, was 
taken to Mid-East Hospital by ASI Dost Mohammad, ASI Joher Maroff and 
SI Javed Afridi. There he was diagnosed as suffering from pneumonia 
and pain in the chest, causing breathing difficulties. At 11:30 pm, 
he stopped breathing, and the doctors declared him dead. His body was 
brought to the Jinnah Hospital for post-mortem and further proceedings 
were made before CIA Magistrate Syed Shabbir Hussain Shah.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 9: The MQM coordination committee condemned the death in 
custody of Abdul Rasheed and demanded that the Chief Justice of Sindh 
High Court institute judicial enquiry into the incident.
 
It said the death of Rashid following alleged torture in the custody 
of CIA, Civil Lines, had vindicated the MQMs stand and exposed state 
terrorism.
    
It said the government took no notice when the MQM protested over the 
death of a prisoner in the Landhi jail last week. The coordination 
committee also flayed human rights organisations for not playing their 
role in the case of custodial deaths.

KARACHI, Jan 9: Senator Ishtiaq Azhar, convenor, MQM coordination 
committee, has urged the human rights organisations to send their 
representatives to investigate the alleged large-scale arrests and 
torture of MQM activists and supporters in prisons.
    
In a statement, he alleged that in the Karachi Central Jail, which has 
a capacity of 900 prisoners, over 4000 people, mostly MQM activists, 
have been dumped in conditions not suitable even for animals.
    
He alleged that hundreds of MQM workers had been shifted to prisons 
in various other parts of the province where they were allegedly being 
subjected to torture.
    
He said such a treatment of political activists was abhorring and 
demanded that such people should be given a fair trial.

<a name="elec">Election fever grips Sanghar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bhagwandas

AS JANUARY 11 approaches, the election activity is gripping the 
otherwise quiet and remote rural areas of Tando Adam, Shahdadpur and 
Sinjhoro talukas of the Sanghar district (NA 181 Sanghar II) where 
people are scheduled to choose their future representative in the 
National Assembly.

Though there are 19 candidates in the run, only four are campaigning 
and making their presence felt at constituency level and appear to be 
serious to get the seat, which had fallen vacant after the election 
petition filed by PPP's Shahnawaz Junejo was accepted and the seat 
occupied by Jam Mashooq Ali (PML) was declared vacant.

Main candidates in the field are: Sen Makhdoom Khaliq-uz-Zaman (PPP-
SB), Sen Fida Hussain Dero (PPP), Haji Mohammad Islam Qureshi (PML N), 
and former MNA Mohammad Usman Khan Noori belonging to the Haji 
Mohammad Haneef Tayyab group, claiming to have the sympathies of 
Maulana Shah Ahmad Noorani as well.

Currently the Muslim League has suffered a setback after being divided 
into Pir Pagara and Nawaz Sharif factions, with locals following the 
dictates from Kingri House, while the settlers looking to Model Town, 
Lahore.

Another big groupthe urban populationthough not in a position to win 
the seat for its candidate, can certainly influence the results as 
happened in the 1990 and 1993 elections. But as no candidate has so 
far been able to win the support of Altaf Hussain, the urban votes 
remain undecided.

The biggest group in the constituency, like anywhere else in the rural 
areas of Sindh, is that of PPP supporters. Though in some other Sindh 
constituencies won by the PPP, some of its supporters are feeling let 
down, as their expectations have not been fulfilled by the party, in 
this constituency, held by the non-PPP person since 1990, such 
dissident vote either does not 'exist or is negligible.

With Mir Murtaza Bhutto, whose faction of the PPP he is representing, 
Khaliq is banking on the almost non-existent dissident PPP votes and 
the Sarwari Jamaat members, some of whom might be undecided or 
confused between their political or religious leaders. Though Mir 
Murtaza has reportedly contacted Altaf Hussain and Pir Sibghatullah 
Shah Rashidi (Pir Pagara's son) to get their support for Makhdoom 
Khaliq, a clear announcement from both Kingri House and from London is 
yet to come. In the absence of open support from Altaf Hussain, 
Makhdoom Khaliq, known for his strong nationalist views, will find it 
difficult to woo the Urdu-speaking votes. MQM on its part might also 
find it difficult to support the Makhdoom, but being an opposition 
candidate goes in his favour and might appeal to the MQM.

Former MNA Mohammad Usman Khan Noori, though a resident of the 
constituency, had been active in the Karachi politics and contested 
and won his NA seat, with the help of Haji Mohammad Hanif Tayyab 
group, in the 1985 partyless polls from the city. If the MQM remains 
undecided he is expected to get a substantial number of the urban 
votes. Though earlier he had been claiming the backing of Maulana Shah 
Ahmad Noorani, he could not appear and present Maulana Noorani's 
letter of nomination, so he could not get the party's symbol.

There are over 300,000 voters (167,562 males and 139,102 females) in 
the constituency and the Election Commission has set up 224 polling 
stations.

Presently it looks quiet difficult that any one candidate will be able 
to get the support of the MQM, PML (Pagara Group), PML (Nawaz Group).    
But in our political culture, where ideologies, principles or other 
such things have become obsolete and are at the bottom of the priority 
list, anything can happen.

However, if any opposition candidate, particularly Makhdoom Khaliq-uz-
Zaman, succeeds in getting the support of MQM and Pir Pagara, and 
Nawaz Sharif also agrees to withdraw his candidate, this otherwise 
one-sided contest, can turn to be an interesting neck to neck race. 
But if the present situation continues and MQM and Pir Pagara remain 
non-committed to anyone it is a smooth sailing for Fida Hussain Dero
who, has a clear edge due to his strong financial position.

Candidates in the run are: Sen. Makhdoom Khaliq-uz-Zaman (PPP Shaheed 
Bhutto Group), Sen. Fida Hussain Dero (PPP), Haji Mohammad Islam 
Qureshi (PML Nawaz), ex-MNA Mohammad Usman Khan Noori (Hanif Tayyab 
group), and independents Umaid Ali Shah, Pir Noor Mohammad Shah 
Jillani, Saindad, Syed Juman Shah, Salahuddin Qureshi, Abdul Khaliq 
Thaheem, Faiz Mohammad Qalander Bux, Lal Bux, Liaquat Ali Shoro, 
Mohammad ayub Khan, Mohammad Juman, Mohammad Hayat, Mohammad Farooq 
Baloch and Mukhtiyar Ali.

<a name="mqmt">MQM to back PML candidate in by-election</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 6: MQM chief Altaf Hussain has announced that his party 
would support the PML candidate in the forthcoming by-election of 
Sanghar, according to the provincial acting general secretary of the 
PML, Mohammad Zahid Rafiq Butt.
    
Mr Butt further claimed that former Sindh minister Jam Mashooq Ali had 
also announced his support for the PML candidate at a meeting with 
Nawaz Sharif. Though there are 19 candidates in the run, the main 
contestants are Fida Mohammad Dero of the PPP; Haji Mohammad Islam 
Quraishi (PML); Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman (PPP-SB) and a former MNA 
Mohammad Usman Khan Noori (JUP-Niazi).

<a name="bena">Benazir has violated PPP manifesto, says Khaliq</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Maisoon Hussein    

THE 249,797 votes of Sanghar constituencya political barometerhave 
become a focus of national politics, with Benazir Bhutto and Murtaza 
Bhutto campaigning personally. The pattern to emerge here might well 
challenge PPPs sole claim of Sindh, and spell the scheme of things to 
come in the province. Mir Murtaza Bhuttos candidate, Makhdoom Khaliq-
uz-zaman, scion of the Pir of Hala, stands confident, riding on a high 
graph of popularity in view of his sacrifices and loyalties, not 
being matched by Benazir. But the final strategy of the opposition is 
yet to be seenwhether it would be a three-pronged contest where PML, 
PML(F) and MQM will benefit while PPP(SB) will dent the hard- core 
votes of the ruling party, or a grand alliance of the opposition will 
emerge in Sindh to make the PPP, which has, till now, returned 
unopposed in all the by-elections of Sindh, meet its Waterloo.
     
Dawn  spoke to Senator Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman, the PPP (SB) candidate 
in the NA-181 (Sanghar) by-election. Following are excerpts of the 
interview:
    
Q: How many elections have you contested and won?
    
A: All three. I was elected as member of Sindh Assembly in l977, 
National Assembly in 1988, and Senate in 1991. I am still the sitting 
Senator.
    
Q: Why did you resign from the PPP presidentship and central committee 
membership?
    
A: Mainly because of differences on national and provincial issues: 
provincial autonomy, division of the province of Sindh and Kalabagh 
dam.
    
Q: Can you elaborate?
    
A: On Oct. 7, l986, when Benazir and I were on a tour of Sindh, she 
told me, at Thatta, that Karachi does not belong to the rest of Sindh. 
That was a shocking blowI felt I could not possibly work under a 
person who stood for division of Sindh.
    
A month later, on the flight to Abbotabad, she said that she would not 
abide by the MRDs agreed formula of provincial autonomy, with the 
Centre having only four subjects. Her words were, Khaliq, how can I 
let the provinces be independent principalities, while I sit at the 
Centre without any power. That was the second blow.
    
And then Kalabagh dam. She was equivocal on the issue, and to date, 
she merely dilly dallies. When three out of four provinces are ruled 
by the PPP, what consensus is she talking about?
    
Q: What is your position?
    
A: I believe its not necessary to store water upstream. A dam 
downstream can save water from being wasted into the sea, irrigate 
Thar and Karachi greenbelt and generate electricity for the rest of 
the country.
    
But by building the dam upstream, Sindh will be deprived of its legal 
share of water, and it will become a desert, while a good portion of 
the NWFP will be inundated.
    
Mr Khar is saying that the Tarbela dam affectees will be settled in 
Sindh. But why? Is Sindh a dumping ground? Why uproot people? People 
are not crops to be transplanted. Sindh has enough problems.
    
Q: One understands now why you said goodbye to Benazir, but what made 
you welcome Murtaza?
    
A: Because of his great struggle to save our founding chairman, 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and his struggle for democracy, against the 
dictatorial tyranny of Zia-ul-Haq and his progeny.
    
When he arrived here, we had several opportunities to meet and to hold 
long sessions together. I found him a man with a vision, deeply wedded 
to the ideals of Shaheed Z. A. Bhutto. He has seasoned himself in the 
hotbed of superpowers war in Afghanistan and the Middle East politics 
in Syria. Academically, he is well qualified and has better grades 
than Benazir at Harvard. Politics for him is not the art of the 
possible(lotaism), but a science of principles for which his father 
sacrificed his life.
    
Q: In the past, the PPP has had a walkover in Sindh by- elections ...
    
A: I would request you to call it sarkari Peoples Party.
    
Q: In the past, sarkari Peoples Party has had a walkover in Sindh. 
What prompted your party to challenge Benazir in Sindh?
    
A: We are challenging the very character of Mohtarmas  sarkari  
Peoples Party. She has left the path of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto by not 
abiding by the partys manifesto, by abandoning the masses and by 
surrounding herself with land grabbers, heroin godfathers, financial 
plunderers, commercial crooks.
    
Most objectionable, the very people who were with Zia during the MRD 
struggle, and those involved in the hanging of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, 
those who made references against her, and those who threw obnoxious, 
concocted pictures of her mother and herself from helicopters in the 
Punjab are now her partys henchmen. So we have come into the field to 
restore the original Peoples Party. And this election campaign has 
already unmasked the true face of Benazir Bhutto.
    
Q: Can you explain the break-up of the power forces in your 
constituency, and how do you see the alignments in the coming 
elections?
    
A: We have been in touch with the MQM for a long time, having 
exchanged views with its members in the Senate. In the present 
context, we have told the party that we are the only alternative who 
can sit with them and try to solve the problem of Sindh. Benazir has 
failed, and no other leadership from any other province, be it Punjab, 
Sarhad or Balochistan, can have an answer to Sindh. We are prepared to 
talk on all issues except two: fifth nationality and fifth province.
    
As far as Pir Sahab Pagaro is concerned, we enjoy a good relationship, 
ever since the return of Murtaza Bhutto.
    
With regards to my election in NA l8l (Sanghar), we also came into 
contact with each other. I went to Lahore and met Pir Sahab Pagaro 
myself, and Mir Murtaza Bhutto has met Raja Sain. In fact, Nasir 
Hussains arrest was part of the rigging because he was the main link 
between us and Pir Sahab Pagaro and Raja Sain.
    
Q: What are the local issues involved in the election campaign?
    
A: In every constituency in Sindh, a criminal plundering alliance of 
Sarkari partymen and Patwaris and police has become a curse for the 
small-time farmer. His fields are starved of water; his cattle lifted, 
and he is exposed to banditry. His development funds are gobbled up by 
partymen, and his children are denied basic health and education. He 
is demeaned and blackmailed everyday in police stations by these party 
leaders who aid and abet crime.
   
The entire sarkari  party has become a party of contractors and 
commission agents, looting even the Zakat and ushr funds. We have come 
to liberate the poor from the Partys heavy-handedness and zulm. We 
will not tolerate these bullies.
    
Q: Even if you win, what difference will one MNA make in the 
Parliament?
    
A: Thats the propaganda being spread by the sarkari PPP. But this is 
not Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman going into the National Assembly, but the 
testing ground of Mir Murtazas l6-year struggle, of Makhdoom Talibul 
Maulas political stand throughout his political career; it is the 
movement of Zulfikar Ali Bhuttothe real PPPgoing into the National 
Assembly, a testing ground of our manifesto, our constitution, and our 
stand on critical issues.
   
And when we win this election, it will be a message not only for 
Islamabad, but for the US, Moscow, etc., that the PPP sarkari has lost 
its hold in its home.
    
Q: How many people originally filed the nomination forms?
    
A: Twenty-one. Two have withdrawn.
    
Q: Why was only your form rejected?
    
A: Because the government feared that they will lose the elections. 
Thats why they are harassing the three candidates who support me. 
Without any warrant, without any case, their houses are daily raided, 
and the electricity to their villages cut offall this, to deter 
people from supporting me. They fear my victory.
    
But they lost the elections the very day I filed the nomination. 
Thats why they changed their candidate. Or else why would they do 
that? Then they came up with some phoney billsof zakat and ushr etc., 
which I had already paid. I produced the documents before the 
returning officer. He disqualified me only because the payment was 
late as I had earlier contested their veracity. Now, how can someone 
be disqualified for that? If late, you pay the surcharge, which I had 
done. This is why I salute the tribunal, Justice Agha and Justice Awan 
of the Sindh High Court, who upheld the appeal.
    
You can well understand the fairness of the government. Even the date 
of polls has been fixed on the second death anniversary of my father.
    
Q: Are Jam Mashooqs people supporting you?
    
A: Let this be a guessing game for the government. I am optimistic. 
They will not be favouring sarkari PPP. Earlier when I came into 
contact with Jam Mashooq Ali, a month ago, he said that if he is not 
restored by the Supreme Court, he will support me. So I hope he will 
stand by his word. The MQM, like functional Muslim League, as I said 
earlier, have not put up any candidates against me. Either they will 
not vote, or if they do, they will vote for me. Q: What about the 
murder case filed by the government against you? What is the status of 
that case?
    
A: They falsely implicated me in Al-Murtaza House, Larkana murder case 
where two of our workers were fired upon and killed inside Al-Murtaza, 
under a police siege. The FIR only mentions, somewhere in the middle, 
that one SHO, not the complainant, spotted me in the crowd. Thats 
all. On this flimsy basis, they charged me with 302. While the fact 
is, I had never left Begum Sahiba and others in Al Murtaza House, when 
they opened fire.
    
Q: What is the role of the major opposition party, Nawaz Sharif?
    
A: I think Mr Nawaz Sharif has been ill-advised to field a candidate 
in this election. It would not be in the interest of the main 
opposition in the National Assembly to spoil the vote. I hope that Mr 
Nawaz Sharif will realise this, so that there is a one-to-one fight 
between sarkari  PPP and me.
    
Q: Do you foresee the Jam Sadiqs action replay by the present 
government in rigging the polls. If so, what action have you 
contemplated?
    
A: Worse than Jam Sadiq Ali and Gen Zia-ul-Haqs period. At least Jam 
Sadiq let the candidates to contest the elections. In this case, the 
three contesting candidates, Syed Jumman Shah, Kalifo Faiz Mohammad, 
Mr Jumman Rang, who announced their support for me, have been forced 
to go into hiding, with the police raiding their homes.
    
We have warned the government of Sindh and the local administration 
not to stop the people from exercising their constitutional right to 
cast their votes. The people are emotionally charged, and if any 
mishap occurs, before or after the elections, then the government will 
be responsible for the consequences. We will go all our way to give 
protection to our people.
    
I invite the local, provincial, national and international media to 
visit and witness the proceedings of the elections, to expose the 
governments attempts of rigging the elections. I also invite the HRCP 
and international human rights organisations to see the real face of 
Benazir.
    
Q: What is at stake in the election in Sindh that even the PM is 
coming to campaign?
    
A: She knows that she will be losing the seat, so she is coming to put 
in the last moment effort. In Punjab, sarkari PPP has already lost 
most by-elections. This election will be a turning point in Sindh. It 
will provide a meeting ground of all the opposition parties of 
Pakistan, evolve a new pattern of polls in all future elections in 
Sindh. It will corrode the very basis of Benazirs power in Sindh.
    
Q: How will the people of Sindh prosper if you win?
    
A: They will prosper in getting rid of Benazir. If I win, it means she 
has lost in Sindh, and if she loses in Sindh, it means she has lost in 
Pakistan. So we will get rid of her. By her, I mean all what she 
stands for: the culture of corruption; bad governance, business 
bunglings and the decay of institutions.

<a name="moha">Mohajirs cant betray Pakistan: Ishtiaq</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

NAWABSHAH, Jan 9: The convenor of MQM co-ordination committee, Senator 
Ishtiaq Azhar, has said the MQM would support the PML candidate in 
Sanghar by-election and he would represent the MQM in the election 
rally of PML in that area as directed by Altaf Hussain.
    
Ishtiaq Azhar said the operation clean-up in Sindh was started during 
the government of Nawaz Sharif in 1992 with the approval of the MQM 
leadership.

Mr Azhar said the Mohajir community wanted equal rights for everyone 
and an end to all kinds of victimisation and acts of suppression which 
were going on in Sindh.
    
Answering another question, the convenor of MQM coordination committee 
said if today people stop calling themselves Punjabis, Sindhis, 
Balochs and Pathans then the Mohajirs would also stop calling 
themselves Mohajirs.

<a name="dero">Dero confident, Qureshi fears dhandli : All eyes on Sanghar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aziz Malik

SANGHAR: All eyes are focused on the by-election for (Sanghar) which 
are only 24 hours away. This is not just another by-election, for the 
very prestige of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party, the Shaheed 
Bhutto group led by Mir Murtaza Bhutto, and Pakistan Muslim League is 
at stake. No wonder that a galaxy of political leaders had descended 
on Shahdadpur and Tando Adam and the state machinery in full swing.

When this correspondent tried to get in touch with the PPP candidate, 
Sen Fida Hussain Dero, at his election office in Tando Adam, he found 
almost the entire Sindh cabinet present there.
    
When Sen Dero was requested to spare some time for Dawn, he said today 
was the last day for canvassing and he was very busy. He, however, 
agreed to spare only a few moments in the evening at the bungalow of 
Atta Mohammad Marri, 38 kilometres away at Berani, after the chief 
minister and Mr Zardari had left for Karachi.
    
This correspondent then came to Shahdadpur to meet the Pakistan Muslim 
League candidate, Haji Mohammad Islam Qureshi, and was confronted with 
a similar situation.
    
FIDA HUSSAIN DERO

Sen Dero is an amiable person and is popular in his constituency, 
including Urdu-speaking people and Punjabi settlers. The reason for 
his popularity is that although he is one of the biggest landlords of 
Sanghar district having over 5,000 acres of rich agricultural land, 
including a 1,400-acre banana orchard.
    

Q. Dero Sahib you are in a strong position. Dont you think the 
presence of Mr Zardari, the chief minister and a host of ministers has 
provided a weapon to your rival candidates to cry wolf.
    
A. There is nothing wrong with it. After all I am a PPP candidate and 
party leaders are bound to work for and support their own candidate. 
Are not the others doing the same thing? Sindh PML president Syed 
Ghous Ali Shah is addressing daily corner meetings in support of Mr 
Islam Qureshi. Similarly, Mir Murtaza Bhutto is also addressing public 
meetings in support of his party candidate, Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman. As 
far as Mr Asif Zardari is concerned I had made a special request to 
him to help me as he enjoys a lot of influence in the area.
    
Q. Have any major groups, parties announced support for you?
    
A. JUI(F) Pir of Naing Sharif, Pir of Ranipur, both groups of Lawari 
Sharif, Pir of Jhoke Sharif, Sajjada Nasheen Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, 
former speaker Sindh assembly Atta Mohammad Marri, Akbar Marri and 
other elders of the Marri tribe, the Sarwari Jamaat, the Sardar of 
Dahiri tribe, provincial ministers Mir Nadir Magsi, Abdul Salam 
Thaheem and Jan Mohammad Brohi, and the Rajput, Godra, Jatt, Ansari, 
Khaskheli and Rind communities have announced their open support for 
me. Besides, the Pakistan Peoples Party itself has a big vote bank in 
my constituency.
    
Q. What about Pir Saheb Pagaro? He is maintaining a discreet silence?
    
A. Pir Pagaro is not opposing me and has left his followers to their 
own choice. This is clear from the fact that Mr Atta Mohammad Marri 
has announced his open support for me after seeking permission from 
the Pir Sahib.
    
Q. What about Shahnawaz Junejo?
    
A. Shahnawaz Junejo is a PPP stalwart and he has been addressing my 
public meetings and will definitely support me.
    
Q. In the past you had also announced your support for Jam Sadiq Ali 
at the cost of PPP. What have you to say about that?
    
A. I had never supported Jam Sadiq Ali, but because of a tragedy in 
the family, I had sought permission from Ms Bhutto to lie low for some 
time.
    
Q. What is your contribution to the PPP?
    
A. I had taken part in the MRD movement of 1983 and 1986 and had been 
incarcerated for 14 months. Jam Sadiq Ali had also put me in jail for 
three months.
    
Q. Why did Jam Sadiq Ali put you in jail?
    
A. Because I had contested provincial assembly elections against him 
when he was the caretaker chief minister of Sindh. My voters were not 
allowed to cast their votes and, therefore, I had boycotted the 
elections. Jam Sadiq Ali was so annoyed that he not only put me behind 
the bars but also bulldozed all the water courses of our family land.
    
Q. How do you claim to enjoy the support of the Sarwari Jamaat when 
their own Pir  Makhdoom Khaliquzzaman  is contesting the elections?
    
A. The spiritual leader of the Sarwari Jamaat is Makhdoom Mohammad 
Amin Faheem and he has announced open support for me. So, it goes 
without saying that his followers will vote for me without any 
exception.
    
Q. What have you to say about the allegations of Muslim League and 
PPP(SB) candidates about election malpractices, harassment of their 
voters and inclusion of 40,000 bogus voters in the voters list?
    
A. No bogus voters have been enrolled and all the allegations being 
levelled against me are baseless and unfounded. The fact is that they 
are trying to find some excuse to wriggle out of the contest.
    
Q. What will be the over-all impact of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement 
support to the PML candidate?
    
A. Not much. It is most surprising that against whom Nawaz Sharif had 
launched the army operation because of their terrorist activities, are 
now being wooed by him.
    
Q. What have you done for the development of your constituency as a 
senator?
    
A. Because of my efforts, 95 villages have been electrified, 46 school 
buildings have been constructed, the prime minister has released Rs40 
million under the Tameer-i-Watan Programme for 10 road schemes, 46 Sui 
gas schemes have been commissioned  four in Hyderabad district and 42 
in Sanghar district  30 PCOs have been established, five roads of one 
kilometre each have been constructed from the sugar cess fund, 
underground telephone cables for seven villages are being laid and 
under the social action board, district council funds and from 
senators development funds, 70 roads have either been completed or 
are under construction. I can rightfully claim that these are record 
development projects in the whole of Pakistan.
    
Q. It is being said that you had only 60 acres of land before you 
became a senator and now you are one of the biggest land holders in 
the district?
    
A. It is absolutely wrong. I have not added one single acre to my 
property after I became a senator. My family owns 5,000 acres and I 
have a 1,400-acre orchard of banana and I am one of the top growers of 
sugarcane and cotton. I dont own any factory or any industry. When my 
father was murdered in 1963, the family had owned only 400 acres, half 
of which was disposed of by my uncle because of family circumstances. 
But through our own efforts and hard labour we purchased the rest of 
the land. 

Islam Qureshi

Mr Qureshi is a new entrant into politics with hardly any political 
background. He deals in decoration business and is not a very rich 
person.
    
Q. Have you ever contested any elections before?
    
A. I contested local bodies elections in 1979, 1983 and 1987. Although 
I lost the first two elections but I had received more votes in 1987 
than the other candidates yet I was not declared elected because of 
dhandhli.
    
Q. What have been your political affiliations?
    
A. I have always been a Muslim Leaguer and for the last 40 years I 
have been supporting Pir Pagaro.
    
Q. Has any other party announced support for your candidature?
    
A. Many communities like the Qureshi baradri and Rajput baradri have 
openly announced their support for me and these communities have quite 
a few votes. I am sure the JUP candidate will also retire in my 
favour. Besides, the ANP and the disciples of Pir Sahib Pagaro will 
also support me. Now I also enjoy the support of MQM which would make 
a world of difference as the MQM has over 30,000 registered voters. In 
addition, there are over 14,000 votes of Punjabi settlers and all of 
them will vote for me.
    
Q. Pir Sahib Pagaro, according to press reports, has declined to 
support the PML candidate? Where does it leave you?
    
A. I have been an ardent supporter of Pir Saheb Pagaro for 40 years 
and I am hopeful that he will not leave me in the lurch. The followers 
of Pir Pagaro have also appealed to their spiritual leader to allow 
them to vote for me.
    
Q. How many registered voters are there in the constituency?
    
A. In the 1993 elections, there were about 260,000 registered voters 
but now over 40,000 bogus voters have been included by the PPP to 
ensure the victory of its candidate.
    
Q. Do you apprehend any malpractice?
    
A. Malpractices have already started. Serial numbers in large number 
of voters lists are missing and no address of the voters is given in 
the list which speaks volumes for advance rigging. In one case the 
names of three brothers have been entered in the list and the age of 
all the three is mentioned as 21 years. The PPP government is doing 
everything to win the elections as the other name of the PPP is 
dhandhli. My supporters are being harassed and my election office in 
Tando Adam has been raided. Only day before yesterday, the PPP 
candidate had personally threatened Abdul Qadir Dahiri, an elder of 
the Dahiri community who had left the PPP and joined the PML, with 
dire consequences if he did not rejoin the PPP. Not only this but even 
the irrigation water of my supporters in Shahpur Chakar has been 
stopped which would destroy the wheat crop.
    
Q. Are you satisfied with the outcome of your election campaign?
    
A. Yes, I am fully satisfied as I am pulling more crowds than even 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto herself. When the prime minister 
addressed an election meeting in Sinjhoro only a few days back, hardly 
4,000 people were present whereas over 5,000 people attended my corner 
meetings.

HYDERABAD, Jan 9: The motorcade of PML chief Mian Nawaz Sharif was 
attacked by unidentified men on the National Highway near Hala in 
which the windscreen of Mr Sharifs Pajero and the windowpanes of half 
a dozen other vehicles were broken. Mr Sharif escaped unhurt.
    
About a dozen PML leaders and workers, including former Sindh minister 
Ismail Rahu, were hit by stones and injured.
    
Eyewitnesses told Dawn that Mr Sharif had inaugurated his party office 
at Hala, the first of any political party in the PPP stronghold, and 
addressed a sizeable gathering.
    
The police intervened some time later and the convoy proceeded towards 
Bhitshah where the leader of the opposition offered Fateha.

<a name="ghou">Ghous alleges attempt on Nawazs life</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

HYDERABAD, Jan 9: Syed Ghous Ali Shah, provincial chief of Pakistan 
Muslim League, and other party leaders have alleged that a murderous 
attack was made on the life of the leader of opposition and former 
prime minister, Mian Nawaz Sharif, on the National Highway near Hala 
on Tuesday morning. However, Mr Sharif miraculously escaped unhurt 
while 12 others were injured.
    
Giving details, he alleged the firing and stoning was done under 
police protection and from the government vehicles.
    
What sort of democracy is this where a former prime minister and the 
leader of the opposition is attacked?, Syed Ghous Ali Shah asked.
    
He claimed that the PPP was loosing the Sanghar by-election and 
therefore it had resorted to third degree tactics to frighten the 
voters.
    
He alleged that the in-charge of the Sanghar by-election and 
provincial co-ordinator of the party, Mr Mumtaz Ridh, had also been 
kidnapped.
    
He regretted that the traditions of Sindh had been violated at Hala 
and warned the administration that time never remained stationary and 
things were likely to change.
    
He said the assailants had already been identified by the people and 
gave their names as Ameer Bux Solangi, Geedro who was a schoolteacher, 
Khalifo, Ramoon Mallah, Dhani Bux Arbab, Ghulam Ali Khoso and Arbab 
Mallah.
    
Mr Ghous Ali Shah pledged that the PML will not be cowed down and 
added that PPP had lost its nerves as it was fast loosing ground in 
Sindh and a large number of people had joined the PML.

<a name="alta">Altaf flays attack on Nawaz</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Jan 9: The attack near Hala on a procession led by Muslim 
League leader Mian Nawaz Sharif has been condemned by MQM leader Altaf 
Hussain who said that the firing by the PPP supporters and attempts to 
kidnap their rivals was an open and blatant act of state terrorism.
    
The incident demonstrates that the government wants to win the Sanghar 
parliamentary by-election not through the ballot but by the bullet, he 
said in a statement.
    
Mr Hussain accused the PPP of adopting heavy handed methods even 
before the polling day. He accused the party of introducing violence 
in politics and said whether they are in or out of power the PPP 
leaders allow the party to work for the elimination of its political 
rivals.
    
They are again using the state machinery to do the same though the PPP 
projects itself as a democratic party outside the country. He 
condemned the use of force to resolve political issues and said that 
the targeting of political rivals by the PPP government is damaging 
for democracy and national security.
    
He pointed out that he had warned of this trend when the government 
started its brutal attacks against the MQM but his warning was not 
heeded.
    
The attack on Nawaz Sharif, he added, shows that the PPP cannot 
tolerate any political opposition.
    
He asked for action against those who were involved in the attack and 
for the suspension of officials who neglected their duty in protecting 
Mr Sharif.

<a name="oppo">Opposition calls for presidents intervention</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 10: Accusing the prime minister, her husband and the 
Sindh chief minister of masterminding an assassination attempt on 
Mian Nawaz Sharifs life, the opposition has sought the immediate 
intervention of President Farooq Legahri in this matter of grave 
national importance.
    
The details of the letter sent to the president by PML secretary 
general Sartaj Aziz were made public at a joint Press conference by 
Sartaj Aziz, Iftikhar Gilani and Chaudhry Jafar Iqbal here on 
Wednesday.
    
Sen Aziz reminded the president that the latest attack on Nawaz in 
Hala was the third attempt on the life of the leader of the 
opposition, pointedly noting that after the earlier attempt the 
president had informed the PML about the setting up of a judicial 
committee but that so far nothing seemed to have come out of it. He 
said that the series of attacks did not rule out the  possibility of 
building up a fatal finale.
    
Sen Aziz wanted the president to play his constitutional role by 
taking cognisance of the governments failings in protecting the 
leader of the opposition. He went even further to actually charge that 
the assailants had been brought to the attack venue in police vehicles 
and that the very fact that the whole incident took place in the 
presence of police and magistracy and yet no arrests were made, 
strongly points at the collusion of the police and magistracy in the 
incident.
    
Replying to a question he said no FIR had been registered so far 
because the attackers could not be identified so far. He, however, 
could not explain why an FIR had not been registered against the prime 
minister, her spouse and the CM even when the opposition had already 
accused them of orchestrating the attack. Speaking on the occasion 
both Mr Gilani and Chaudhry Jafar deplored the incident, with Mr 
Gilani lamenting about the gradual destruction of the democratic 
norms and institutions in the country.
    
In a related move the opposition has also requisitioned a session of 
the National Assembly to discuss, among other things, the attempt on 
the life of the leader of the opposition in Hala, at the behest of 
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Asif Zardari and Abdullah Shah. It is 
for the first time that the charges of attempted murder against 
members of the first family comprise the official agenda of a national 
assembly sitting. The other items include the countrys financial 
situation, law and order, and the Karachi issue.
    
Sen Aziz has also shot off a letter to the chief election 
commissioner, apprising him of the details of the attack and also 
listing a number of other grievances related to the forthcoming by-
election in the Sanghar constituency.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Jan 10: Minister of state for Law and Justice Mian Raza 
Rabbani refuted oppositions allegations that PPP was involved in an 
alleged attack on the leader of the opposition during his visit to 
Hala.
    
Talking to newsmen Mr Rabbani said it was false and incorrect that PPP 
in any way was involved in an alleged attack at Hala on the opposition 
leader.

Mr Rabbani said that due to his lust for power he was still following 
the same policy of not condemning terrorism in Sindh, and his refusal 
to make categorical policy statement on MQMs demand for bifurcation 
of Sindh could be reasons which infuriated the people of Sindh.
    
Similarly, he said, election campaign was going on peacefully before 
Mr Sharifs visit to Sanghar and it was only after his arrival that an 
incident of such nature had taken place.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 10: Sindh PML chief Syed Ghous Ali Shah has condemned the 
attack on the life of the leader of the opposition, Mian Nawaz 
Sharif, in Hala, and demanded formation of a committee headed by a 
Supreme Court judge to conduct a probe into the incident.
    
Speaking at a Press conference at Karachi Press Club on Wednesday, he 
said: It was an act of cowardice by the PPP workers, and the 
authorities should immediately register an FIR against the persons 
responsible for the attack, otherwise the PML will approach the court 
of law.
    
Moreover, the PML would launch a countrywide protest in case the FIR 
was not registered, judicial inquiry was not ordered, and culprits 
were not taken to task, the PML leader said. The PML has already 
provided a list of the names of attackers to the officials concerned, 
he said.
    
Mr Ghous alleged that the attack was engineered by the PPP government, 
with the collusion of local administration and police, when it 
realised that Mian Nawaz Sharifs popularity graph was going up in 
Sindh and PPP candidate was going to suffer a defeat in Sanghar by-
election.
    
He accused the PPP of pursuing a policy of intimidation and 
harassment. Such undemocratic actions were a part of PPP culture, he 
said, adding, we are still determined to thwart the PPP designs.

Staff Correspondent

HYDERABAD, Jan 9: The in charge of divisional information cell 
Pakistan Peoples Party, Hyderabad, Dr Tahseen Shaikh at a hurriedly 
called Press conference at Magsi house and accused the leader of the 
opposition Mr Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and other PML leaders, including 
Shah Mohammad Shah, of attack on PPP workers at Hala resulting in 
injuries to many of them.
    
He said the entire election campaign of all the candidates for Sanghar 
by-elections was going on very smoothly and no untoward incident had 
taken place before the arrival of Nawaz Sharif.
    
He wondered why Nawaz Sharif had not come to Hala according to his 
scheduled programme. He termed the attack on PPP workers as a 
conspiracy by the anti-PPP forces with a view to sabotaging the 
election process.   

He claimed that Hala was the PPP fort and all the residents of the 
town were PPP supporters. He said the PML had staged a drama to blame 
PPP of election malpractice.
    
Speaking on the occasion the general secretary of PPP Hala taluka, Dr 
Bilal, said that an audio cassette of Benazir Bhutto was being played 
at a video shop when the PML supporters resorted to indiscriminate 
firing and attacked PPP workers.
    
He alleged that PML and MQM supporters had chalked objectionable 
slogans on the walls of PPP workers and added that goonda elements had 
been brought from Badin and other parts of interior Sindh by the PML.
    
He alleged that Zaman Shah, the brother of PML leader, Shah Mohammad 
Shah, Ghulam Mohammad Korejo and others had come to video shop and 
threatened to destroy the flags of PPP under the orders of Nawaz 
Sharif, Ghous Ali Shah, Shah Mohammad Shah and others. He alleged that 
Zaman Shah and Ghulam Mohammad were criminals and involved in 
kidnapping and dacoity cases.
    
He said as a result of attack six persons namely Ghulam Akbar Bhutto, 
Ramzan Mallah, Lakha Dino Korai, Ayub Abbasi, Dr Fareed Memon and 
Manzoor Memon were injured while some others had been admitted to

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ghulam Hasnain

KARACHI, Jan 7: At least seven passengers were killed and 35 others 
wounded  25 of them critically  when a powerful bomb blew up a jam-
packed bus on the main Shahrea- Faisal during evening rush hours.
    
The explosion in a passenger bus  the first of its kind in Karachi  
added a new dimension to the on-going terrorism in the megalopolis.
    
 There was fire and smoke. Inside the bus there were several mangled 
bodies burning. Many people in a semi-nude condition were lying on the 
road, crying and shouting for help. Some had lost their limbs. Many 
had their legs and feet badly smashed, driver Ghulam Dastagir Qureshi 
of Edhi, who was among the first few to reach the spot, said.
    
All of the wounded received burn wounds ranging from 15 to 80 per 
cent. Many had their flesh ripped off. Wounded passengers ordeal was 
compounded when they were brought to Jinnah Hospital which was in a 
mess and totally unable to tackle a tragedy of such magnitude. There 
were only a few doctors and nurses to look after the wounded brought 
by Edhi ambulances and vehicles of some other organisations.
    
Doctors immediately ran out of a small stock of general medicine they 
had with them and many wounded passengers were then put on empty 
hospital beds, endlessly waiting for proper treatment.
    
Several senior government officials were present but none of them 
seemed to take notice that the hospital was without any medicines or 
life saving drugs.

LONDON, Jan 7: The MQM leader Altaf Hussain has expressed deep regrets 
over the death of several people in a bomb explosion in a public bus 
in Karachi and described it as the worst form of terrorism. He said 
this incident is a clear example of the Governments incompetence and 
failure in safeguarding the life and property of ordinary citizens. He 
said the present Government has no justification for continuing to 
rule even for another day.
    
Mr Hussain said that the resources of the Government and its agencies 
were being used to crush its political opponents. These agencies are 
used to lay siege of Mohajir localities to eliminate them while 
terrorists and saboteurs have been freedom to operate as they wish. 
Huge state resources are spent on guarding the President, the Prime 
Minister, ministers and their families but ordinary taxpayers find 
themselves helpless against terrorism.
    
The Government, he added, cannot cover up its incompetence by blaming 
others for the mishaps in the country. He said the present Government 
has not given anything else to the people except corruption, terrorism 
and inflation. He called on the President to order the payment of 
compensation to the injured and the relatives of the dead, and held 
the interior minister and the Sindh Government responsible for it.

<a name="paki">Pakistan to launch second experimental satellite</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ashraf Mumtaz   

LAHORE, Jan 7: Pakistan will complete its second experimental 
satellite, Badr -II, by the end of the current calendar year. At 
present, it is holding talks with different countries to have a 
launching facility, Dawn learnt through official sources.
    
The satellite is being made by the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere 
Research Commission (SUPARCO).
    
Sources said since Pakistan did not have the launching facility of 
its own, it was trying to get the facility from other countries at the 
lowest rates.
    
Pakistan had launched its first such satellite in July 1990 but had 
lost contact with it only after five weeks. All efforts to restore 
contact with the missing satellite had failed. However, SUPARCO had 
achieved valuable data during the period the Badr-I remained in the 
orbit.
    
Initially, it was expected that the SUPARCO would launch the second 
satellite during 1993. However, the target could not be achieved 
because of the difficulties that cropped up. The Badr-II will help 
Pakistan in the development of low-cost satellites and creation of 
infrastructure for space qualified system and acquisition of know-how 
and capability in the field of satellite attitude control.
    
Pakistan, the sources said, would also acquire know-how and technology 
for earth imaging with the help of some sensors.
    
The second satellite will be an advanced version of the Badr- I. It is 
expected to weigh 60 kilograms and will be placed in orbit at an 
altitude of 500 to 800 kilometres.

<a name="rele">Release of loan : IMF asks Islamabad to meet criteria for performance</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Jan 8: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked the 
government to meet the performance criteria of the standby 
arrangement to qualify for the second tranche of 200 million dollars 
of the 600 million dollars promised under the agreement.
    
The second tranche was contingent on the strict review of macro 
economic data by the IMF mission arriving here at the end of this 
month or early February.
    
Pakistan has been asked to show the fulfilment of various targets set 
for Dec. 31, 1995 which included lowering of the bank borrowing from 
Rs55 billion in five months against Rs30 billion for the entire 
financial year.
    
The Fund had agreed during pre-standby loan talks with the government 
to enhance the borrowing ceiling to Rs40 billion in the first six 
months as a concession in the face of a bad revenue collection 
position. The final target for the entire financial year ending June 
30, 1996 would, however, remain Rs 30 billion.
    
The IMF further called for maintaining certain amount of foreign 
exchange reserves which were now said to be 1.6 billion dollars. The 
Fund requires that the reserves do not go down beyond one billion 
dollars at any time during the next half of the financial year and 
that they must rise to 1.8 billion dollars by June end.
    
Likewise, certain performance has to be shown to reassure that the 
government was capable of achieving the new GDP growth target of 6 per 
cent and a budgetary deficit target of 4.6 per cent of the GDP.
    
Sources said that the IMF mission would finalise its recommendations 
after talks with the government which will then be submitted to the 
IMF management. And then these recommendations will be forwarded to 
the Funds Board for final decision.
    
Sources said that expanding the taxation base by the Central Board of 
Revenue (CBR) would also be one of the important issues to be 
discussed by the IMF mission with the Pakistani authorities. The CBR 
has already reduced its annual revenue target to Rs 265 billion from 
Rs 270 billion which, it is feared would be brought down further in 
view of the weak recovery position. Press reports alleging doctoring 
of revenue collection figures would also come up for detailed 
discussion.

ISLAMABAD, Jan 7: The leader of the alleged military coup, Maj. Gen 
Zaheerul Islam Abbasi, has claimed that he was illegally arrested, 
tortured and is being denied his rights as an army general and as a 
citizen of Pakistan.
    
The press release maintained, the general was in a unlawful custody, 
and was denied even his basic rights as a human-being. At one stage 
he was almost choked to death, the three-member team of lawyers

Gen Abbasi, Brig Mustansar Billah and about 40 other military officers 
were arrested on Sept 26 on the charge of plotting to storm a corps 
commanders meeting scheduled to be held on Sept 30 at the general 
headquarters in Rawalpindi. They were also accused of conspiring to 
kill the president, the prime minister and some important ministers of 
the cabinet.
    
The generals defence lawyers also said the federal government 
authorities had been making public statements, maligning him and

against Pakistan, to wipe out the entire top brass of the army and 
even to kill the prime minister and her husband.

KARACHI, Jan 4: The Pakistan International Airlines maintains that it 
has provided the factual position to the federal anti-corruption 
committee (FACC) with regard to its June 6 flight on the Islamabad-
Delhi-Lahore sector.
     
Charter or extra-sections are aviation terminologys designated to 
flights that operate out of normal schedule for commercial or 
operational reasons, the PIA in its reply to the FACC contended. 
	It offered this explanation after the FACC reacted sharply on 
getting two different versions for a PIA Fokker flight on June 6 that 
went to New Delhi from Islamabad and returned to Lahore the same day.
     
The Civil Aviation Authority had informed the FACC that it was a 
flight chartered for the National Power Company. The PIA, however, 
maintained that it was an extra-section flight, and did not provide 
any further information. In its recent communication, the PIA informed 
the FACC that its flight PK2712 operated on the Islamabad-Delhi sector 
on June 6 and carried Keith Henry, chief executive of the National 
Power of UK. 
   
The flight was chartered on the requirement of foreign ministry, the 
PIA informed the FACC. The same plane, it said, returned as a ferry 
flight to Lahore the same day after dropping Mr Henry in Delhi.
   
The airline also informed the FACC that on the return flight there 
were no passengers on board, nor was there any baggage or cargo. The 
same aircraft then operated as a normal flight, on the Lahore-
Islamabad sector, carrying a full load of passengers.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz and Altaf agree on common approach</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Athar Ali

LONDON, Jan 4: In their talks, the opposition leader, Mian Mohammad 
Nawaz Sharif and the MQM chief Mr Altaf Hussain, are said to have 
decided on a common approach to tackle the situation, particularly 
in Karachi.
    
Mr Nawaz Sharif later said the removal of the present government was a 
must, without which the situation in Karachi, and the country as a 
whole would not improve. But, he emphasised that all democratic and 
peaceful means would be used to dislodge the government.
    
According to the MQM sources, Mian Nawaz Sharif, who was shown 
photographs and documents by Mr Altaf Hussain to prove his charges 
against the law enforcement agencies, assured him that he had and 
would continue to condemn the atrocities being committed against the 
Mohajirs, and would inform the Pakistani people about the terrorism 
for which the government was responsible.
    
About his talks with the MQM leader, Mr Sharif said that they 
discussed the current political situation with special reference to 
Karachi. The situation of law and order generally was bad in Pakistan 
but continuing violence in Karachi has paralysed the most important 
commercial centre. If the present situation there continues any 
further Pakistan far from becoming a South Asian Tiger will 
economically fall behind other countries of the region, he said.
    
The Muslim League leader said it was absolutely essential to try and 
bring Karachi to normality for the sake of the economic and social 
well-being of the whole country. He held the government responsible 
for the deterioration in Karachi. He condemned state terrorism and 
said the present conditions had largely been created by the 
government.
    
Answering a question Mr Nawaz Sharif said If forces inimical to 
Pakistan are exploiting the situation, the opportunity has been 
provided to them by the government. He said his party in opposition 
had done all it could, adopting peaceful and lawful means. We dont 
want to give up the path of peace. But, he warned, that the situation 
was moving to a point when the nation would be willing to adopt any 
steps that might be required to save the country. They will have to 
take their decisions in their own hands, if they find that the 
politicians have failed to resolve the problems of unemployment, 
corruption, etc., and have also failed to stop the bloodshed in 
Karachi. They will be justified in that kind of action.
    
Mr Nawaz Sharif said if it became necessary to conduct extra 
parliamentary campaign he would do so. But first he wanted to exhaust 
all the options. We do not want to take the country towards more 
uncertainty than it faces at present, and want to try every peaceful 
method.
    
The government, the Muslim League leader said had neither the capacity 
nor the competence to do anything positive. It does not listen to the 
opposition with which its relations have been strained.

In general, The roads to all corruption, people have come to believe, 
lead to the door of the Prime Ministers House. There is uncertainty 
and disillusionment all around them. Rumours or speculation about the 
fall of the government cause the stock and share prices to rise. This 
is something peculiar to Pakistan, he said adding that in other 
countries share prices rose not with the speculation about the fall of 
the government but if the government was stable.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Jan 5: Pakistan Muslim League leader Mian Nawaz Sharif and MQM 
chief Altaf Hussain had a lengthy meeting and came to the conclusion 
that 'incompetence of the government' was main cause for serious 
problems facing the country and it was not possible to solve these 
problems without the change of the Bhutto regime.

In a joint statement issued, both leaders agreed that the big loss of 
life in Karachi and other areas of urban Sindh was due to the 
'brutalities and atrocities of the government.'

The two leaders pledged to work together for the well-being and 
prosperity of the country in the belief that the entire nation was 
looking up to them for getting the country out of the mess.

By changing the government, they said, they would ensure the supremacy 
of fundamental rights and the rule of law. Mr Sharif and Mr Hussain 
promised that the change of the government would soon occur with the 
help of the people and it would be ensured that the present rulers do 
not run away from Pakistan. They would be made to account allegedly 
for wrecking the country by their exploitation, they said.

They asked the bureaucracy not to obey unlawful orders of the 
government. Anyone indulging in such conduct would be fully held 
accountable by the next government. They warned the people that if 
they remained silent or inactive at this juncture, incalculable damage 
may befall the country.

The statement contains a pledge to scrutinise the atrocities committed 
on the Mohajirs in the urban areas of Sindh and to demand full 
accountability of those responsible for the present state of affairs.   
The two leaders committed that they would restore the supremacy of the 
Constitution, encourage investment and improve the taxation systems 
together with an improvement in the law and order situation.

The joint statement offers a guarantee that the economic and political 
deprivation of the Mohajir population would be attended to by the 
state and they would be given justified Constitutional rights.

PESHAWAR, Jan 6: Begum Nasim Wali Khan, provincial president of Awami 
National Party, has said that the Pakistan Peoples Party has lost 
public mandate and political support of its allies due to its pursuing 
of wrong economic and foreign policies.
    
She said Benazir Bhuttos undemocratic policies had forced her own 
party workers to raise their voice against leadership. She regretted 
that people were facing lack of basic necessities of life, like 
education, health and food while prime ministers husband was making 
foreign medical teams available for the treatment of his horses.
    
She declared that ANP would not let PPP and its allies to usurp the 
rights of the poor and play with the future of the country. She said 
that insult caused to the peoples mandate by the Peoples Party has

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Jan 6: The United States had informed Pakistan about 
Indian plans to carry out a second nuclear test in Rajhasthan much 
before the news was broken by New York Times, Dawn learnt.

Knowledgeable sources said the US intelligence had picked up the 
activity at Pokharan and Washington had immediately conveyed its 
strong views to New Delhi which included a warning and a threat of 
sanctions.
    
Pakistan was informed by the Clinton administration immediately 
thereafter but Islamabad was told not to make it an issue as 
Washington was quietly trying to dissuade India from carrying out the 
test.
    
Several diplomatic notes were given to New Delhi by the US ambassador 
Frank Wisner and these clearly stated that a test by India would force 
the US to invoke the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Law which 
imposes instant sanctions.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 8: The Federal Cabinet approved the construction of a 
monument in Islamabad in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of 
Pakistans independence.
    
To be built at a cost of Rs600 million, the monument will have a 
convention centre, banquet halls, art galleries and a restaurant, 
information minister Khalid Kharal told reporters at a briefing after 
the cabinet meeting.
    
The 250-foot high monument will have a 120-seat restaurant at the top 
with viewing gallery.

He said the cabinet decided that to reduce the initial cost, only the 
monument and the convention centre would be build in the first go and 
will be completed before the special Islamic summit scheduled to be 
held in Islamabad in March 1997 in connection with the Golden Jubilee 
celebrations.
    
Kharal said as the federal capital was short of convention centre it 
was decided to build a 2,000-seat modern convention centre with the 
monument.

ISLAMABAD, Jan 9: The government has decided to extend ban on mobile 
phones, pagers and paycard phones in Karachi for another six months, 
sources at the interior ministry told Dawn.
    
The decision to extend the ban was taken by Interior Minister 
Naseerullah Khan Babar. Intelligence agencies strongly opposed the 
idea saying that the ban had worked a lot in breaking the 
communication network of underground terrorist gangs active in 
Karachi.
    
Mobile phone companies sustaining huge losses on account of the 
continuing ban on their operations are considering filing cases 
seeking compensation from the government.

<a name="nisa">Nisar asks Leghari to halt privatisation   </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Jan 4: Former federal minister and central leader of 
Pakistan Muslim League Ch. Nisar Ali Khan has urged President Sardar 
Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari to play his due constitutional role in 
preventing the government from compromising on national financial 
sovereignty on the pretext of privatising UBL to foreign investors and 
PTC at throwaway prices.
    
Ch Nisar said that the government had compromised on the foolproof 
procedure under which a committee under the chairmanship of Governor 
of State Bank had to prequalify the bidders as well as ensure 
transparency. But he said, the PPP government had rejected six 
domestic bidders and got two foreign bidders pre-qualified from a 
political committee which was headed by chairman privatisation 
commission Mr Naveed Qamar, a PPP, MNA from Hyderabad.
    
He said all developing countries, during recent Uruguay Round of 
Talks, unanimously refused to open up their services sector including 
banks for foreign countries because it would tantamount to giving 
their financial control in the hands of foreign countries.
    
He said UBL was the second largest Pakistani Bank having 25 highly 
profitable and foreign exchange earning branches abroad and over 1600 
branches in the country and its sale to foreign parties would 
adversely affect Pakistans interests.
    
Ch Nisar maintained besides fulfilling ulterior motives Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto also wants to prop up her government which is 
about to collapse financially. He said the government had decided to 
sell 26 percent share of the PTC and Rs 27 per share to collect just 
$1.2 billion while the income of PTC met this target amount in just 14 
months.
    
To another question he said the PPP government was knocking at the 
doors of bankruptcy and a loan of $200 million from IMF served as 
oxygen mask for it. He appealed to all legal, constitutional, and 
judicial institutions besides the national press to stop the loot.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Jan 4: The Privatisation Commission put off the sale of 
United Bank Limited till Jan 22 at the request of two bidders selected 
for final bidding.
    
The Privatisation Commission is taking extra measures to make the deal 
fully transparent and has decided not to accept bids in advance. Both 
the sealed bids will be received at the same time and will be opened 
at a public ceremony where representatives of the bidders as well as 
national and international Press would be present, said a source at 
the Commission.
    
The extension of date of final bidding may cause an embarrassment to 
the government. In case both the bids are not acceptable to the 
Commission, it will delay the sale of the bank and the government has 
already made a commitment to the International Monetary Fund that the 
bank will be privatised before Jan 31, a source said.

Qamar disclosed that the Commission has fixed no reference price for 
the United Bank Limited, (UBL) which will be put to hammer on 22nd of 
the current month.
    
The Commission is maintaining utmost transparency in privatising the 
bank and the bids will be received and opened at a ceremony open to 
the press as well, he told a press conference.
    
Refuting the oppositions demand to put off the sale of UBL he said 
the bank was running into losses and needed induction of the fresh 
capital, therefore, the government decided to privatise it.
    
Naveed Qamar also brushed aside, the opposition fears that the 
privatisation of the bank to a foreign investor would be detrimental 
to the countrys economy.
    
He pointed out that a number of foreign banks, including Faysal 
Islamic Bank, which is also a bidder of the UBL were already working 
in the country.
    
Referring to a report of the Standing Committee of the Senate, he 
said, there was no harm in the foreign investment in the services 
sector. Country requires foreign investment, and now, when the 
foreign investment is coming they are raising objections, he said.
    
The Commission, he said, would recall the bids if the Faysal Bank of 
Bahrain and Saudi Basharahil did not offer reasonable price. He said 
they would not sell the bank at a low price just to meet the IMF 
deadline of January 31.
    
Earlier, the final bidding had to take place on January 8 but the two 
foreign firms, short-listed from a list of eight pre-qualified bidder, 
asked for more time to complete the due diligence process.
    
The Commission accepted their request and put of the final bidding 
till January 22.

Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Jan 6: All the four provinces have demanded their share in 
the privatisation proceeds of the Federal government to get the rupee 
component of their debts cleared.
    
The Federal government is reported to have realised more than Rs 119 
billion so far through the sale of national assets sources closely 
linked with the working of the National Finance Commission (NFC) 
estimate. It includes over Rs 74 billion realised in 1995 they said 
and asserted that provinces have legitimate claim to get their share 
from the privatisation proceeds.
    
Provinces are also suggesting to Islamabad to trim its huge 
establishments in respect of those subjects which fall exclusively 
under the provincial jurisdiction in accordance with the 1973 
Constitution.
    
Other demand of the province concerns sharing of Iqra surcharge which 
Islamabad has been collecting for the last 10 years. It is strange 
that education is a provincial subject and Federal government has 
levied Iqra surcharge. Islamabad is collecting this tax and spending 
it without even consulting the provinces is the view of Sindh 
officials providing secretarial support to the NFC.

<a name="kora">Korangi fish harbour gets poor response</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aamir Shafaat Khan

KARACHI, Jan 9: The growing lawlessness at Korangi has delayed the 
commencement of the operations of multi-million rupees Korangi Fish 
Harbour where fishermen and private processors are staying away 
because of the absence of buyers.
    
While the lawlessness has gripped the entire Karachi for the last 
several months, Korangi has been scene of worst killings which has now 
started telling on the economic activities and has affected the 
industrial area as well as the upcoming Korangi Fisheries Harbour.
    
The Harbour was to commence its operations from December 1995 but 
still gives a deserted look because the fishermen and investors have 
stayed away as frequent strikes and outbreak of law and order 
situation in the area has prevented buyers of fish to come there.
    
A massive investment of Rs 903 million involving foreign exchange 
component of Rs 662.538 million in the Korangi Fisheries Harbour 
Project appeared to have been wasted because of the deserted looks at 
the place.
    
Managing Director, KFH, Iqbal Ahmed Turk that the absence of buyers 
coupled with civic frenzy in Karachi particularly in Korangi area was 
threatening the financial viability of the project, causing inordinate 
delay in the Harbour to operate at full thrust, besides dragging feet 
of the prospective investors, fishermen and buyers.
    
Another decisive deterrent for poor response, he said, was the non- 
existence of any nationalised or private banks in the Harbour despite 
sending several communiquis to the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and 
other banks to set up a branch at the Harbour for the businessmen.
    
The KESC, Iqbal Turk added, had also played havoc with the Authority 
for not supplying 600 KVA of electricity since 1991 and at present the 
area lighting of the KFH was now entirely dependent on power 
generators.
    
The Project, Iqbal said, had to complete in 1994-95 but KFH did not 
get funds amounting to about Rs 100 million for the installation of 
navigational aids and construction of roads and drainage. 
Preparations are under way for the completion of the above works by 
June 1996 after the release of funds, He added.
    
Iqbal Turk was of the view that new registration of trawlers at the 
Karachi Fish Harbour should now be discouraged so that fishermen could 
divert their attention towards Korangi Harbour.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KARACHI, Jan 4: Jameel Ahmed Bhutto, member (Securities) Corporate Law 
Authority (CLA) has said that the objectives of the CLA and the stock 
exchanges was one and the same we are partners in progress and our 
mutual coordination is necessary for the market development.

President KSE, Mr Arif Habib said the CLA and KSE through their co-
ordinated efforts can play and important role for development of 
capital market.

He said the basic emphasis would be on the improvement of corporate 
behaviour for which a committee had been constituted efforts, and 
reactivate computerised trading system on a full scale. However, a 
well thought policy would be presented to the government on various 
issues relevant to the public offerings, right issues, premium, GDR 
convertible, etc.

He spoke of the problem being faced by the members as a result of the 
introduction of the settlement system. Due to this process not, only 
members, foreign investors and financial institutions are facing 
difficulties in handling settlement and deliveries on day-to-day 
basis, but the trading activities in all such companies, which are 
regulated through this process are also at a low level.

He said such a process of settlements and deliveries is in operation 
worldwide, only where a depository system is in operation. 
Unfortunately this aspect had not been considered by the CLA while 
introducing this process. He urged the member-CLA to do away with this 
system immediately.

He drew the attention to the proposals to carry out various amendments 
in listing regulations, which are necessary for the operation of 
depository and providing certain stringent provisions for regulating 
the corporate behaviour. He urged to review the decision about the 
suspension of provincial listing.

<a name="alvi">Alvi for saving tax structure from annihilation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

FAISALABAD, Jan 4: The world economists have expressed their unanimous 
opinion to eliminate the tax exemption and subsequently decrease the 
tariff of taxes and duties in order to achieve a sustained economic 
progress.

Elaborating in detail the policy guidelines of the Pakistan government 
taxation policy, the chairman CBR emphatically said that if we intend 
to save our tax structure from annihilation, we should evolve a 
uniform system under which the customs and income tax rates shall have 
to be reduced, the taxation system be made broad-based and the 
exemptions of taxes and duties be curtailed to maximum.

The chairman CBR said the government is keen to rationalise its 
taxation policy under which minimum taxes and duties be levied on the 
people. He said the government has considerably decreased the 
corporate tax during the last three years to 35 percent in public 
sector, 45 percent in private sector and 50 percent in the banking 
sector from existing 60 per cent.

Regarding the duty drawback, the chairman CBR revealed that the 
government has taken a drastic and historic step for the expeditious 
settlement of the duty drawback cases and issued directions to the 
commercial banks and institutions to immediately pay the claims to 
their clients, and later receive it from the government. He said that 
under this direction, the banks would surely receive the duty drawback 
amount from the government within six months time, unless any 
irregularity is traced by the customs authorities in a specific case.

The chairman CBR further elaborated that it would be optimum effort of 
the government not to impose taxes on consumer goods so that the 
common man is not affected.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, Jan 9: The Central Board of Revenue (CBR), has surpassed 
the tax collection target of Rs 116 billion in the first half of the 
fiscal 1995/96 beginning July.
    
The CBR chairman told a news conference that the indirect taxes 
totalled Rs 85.6 billion against a target of Rs 84 billion, and direct 
taxes stood at Rs 33 billion against a target of Rs 32 billion.
    
He said the main increase had come from customs collection and sales 
tax on the imported goods. Customs and sales tax on the imported 
duties increased tremendously to Rs 17.2 billion during November and 
December.
    
Answering a question, he agreed that the tax collection had picked up 
after the imposition of 10 per cent regulatory duty and seven per cent 
devaluation of rupee against the dollar announced by the government.
    
He said the tax collection improved, despite reduced tariffs and 
income tax. He said the increase was due to the efforts made by his 
department for bringing more people into the tax net.

<a name="bank">Banking on our political paucity</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD: The World Bank must have a unique relationship with 
Pakistan. On one hand, its reluctant to give us loans when we really 
need them, and on the other, it goes out of its way to provide us with 
a prime minister (albeit of a caretaker kind). But contrary to the 
common perception, Pakistan has not had a one-way relationship with 
the WB. We, too, have given back a lot to the bank in the form of 
brilliant men like Mian Muzaffar Ahmed and also the astute ones like 
Dr Mahbubul Haq.
    
Ironically however, the present breed of expatriate Pakistanis 
ensconced in their WB offices would rather emulate Dr Haq in his 
intelligent use of the WB offices than Mr Ahmed. Shahid Javed Burki, 
vice president in charge of the banks operations in the Caribbean and 
Latin American region, is no exception.
    
But there is a reason for the Burkis of the world to look up to Dr Haq 
who, though having remained a finance minister, held a much lower 
office in WB than Mr Burki. Not that it stopped Dr Haq from cutting a 
tall figure for himself back home. Despite getting an opportunity to 
serve under a despot and to enforce any financial discipline of his 
preference, the fact remains that Dr Haq simply did not deliver and 
proved a rather easy adversary for the then rising stars like Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan and company. Now, well rested and revived for a second 
round, it has been a chastened and a much wiser Dr Haq to emerge from 
the vaults of the World Bank.
    
Fully realising the aura surrounding the World Banks name, the doctor 
made it a deliberate habit of popping up in Pakistan without fail and 
to expound one financial panacea after another, budget after budget. 
He was the only former finance minister to claim front page space 
without even being a major political figure. Not only that; he also 
kept getting audiences with all those who mattered. This was the first 
time someone had made an intelligent use of a World Bank title in 
Pakistan.
 
But then the arrival of Moeen Qureshi took the WB image to new 
heights. A whole new category of ambition was instantly created and it 
was only natural for other Pakistani-origin stalwarts of the bank to 
start dreaming about a similar play of fate in their favour.
    
And this phenomenon does not exist in the minds of chronic cynics 
alone as betrayed by the nervousness caused recently by the 
simultaneous arrival of Dr Haq, Mr Burki and a couple of other top 
level WB officials in Pakistan. Matters even got to a point where 
newspapers kept openly hinting about the possibility of some major 
political change in the country and at one stage Mr Burki had to 
formally deny having come with any secret agenda. The gentleman kept 
acting surprised and at times even agitated by the attention he was 
getting but according to close associates, he loved every minute of 
it.

For someone who holds no official folio for the region or Pakistan in 
particular, Mr Burki interestingly made it a point to discuss 
Pakistans economics with everyone, including the president. But, 
according to a very close relative his best piece of conversation took 
place with the present governments financial wizard, V. A. Jafarey.
    
But first the trivia pertaining to his stay. The same relative 
confided that the list of callers on the World Bank executive read 
like the financial and political Whos Who of Pakistan and that he 
was being treated with a reverence normally reserved for the head of 
the government or the COAS, and they all knew he could never become 
the COAS so that leaves only... The remark was deliberately allowed 
to trail off unfinished and capped by a hearty laughter but apparently 
the countrys influential didnt view it as a laughing matter. You 
never know when another Moeen Qureshi could happen!
    
Anyway, coming back to the Burki-Jafarey chit chat. According to the 
source, Mr Burki reportedly expressed his extreme concern over 
Pakistans economic situation and revealed to our ace fiscal wizard 
that according to WBs internal assessment, Pakistans real foreign 
exchange reserves stood at a peanut US$31 million. But if he expected 
the white-haired gentleman sitting across him to lose a further shade 
or two, he was sadly disappointed because Mr Jafarey kept looking at 
him with a dead pan expression.
    
But you dont become a WB executive if you cant instil the scare of 
the bank in the hearts of the lesser third-world mortals and so Mr 
Burki persisted ahead with his doomsday scenario.

He supposedly told Mr Jafarey that the bank was now viewing Pakistan 
on the lines of Mexico where only a last-minute fiscal intervention by 
the US government and the bank  which of course came in the wake of 
the acceptance of some of the harshest-ever terms by the Mexican 
government  saved the country from an absolute financial disaster. 
Once again, Mr Jafarey appeared totally unruffled. An undaunted Mr 
Burki then went on to warn the countrys de facto finance minister 
that when the crunch came, the Pakistan government might not even get 
as many days as Mexico to prevent an economic ruin. Once again, all 
that he evoked from Mr Jafarey was a cold, unperturbed stare.
    
Finally Mr Jafarey spoke. In as many words he reportedly told the 
World Bank hot shot that in the event of a financial crisis he 
couldnt do a thing even if he wanted to because its impossible for 
me to get an appointment before two weeks. Even this early 
appointment, according to him, was a courtesy of two very influential 
business personalities of the capital.
    
It was Mr Burkis turn to let his jaw drop open in amazement. After 
all, it does sound a bit ludicrous to believe that in a country where 
even the minions of the government have an access to the national 
exchequer, its custodian does not have any to the prime minister.
    
Mr Burki later confided to his close kin either the gentleman was 
trying to take me for a ride or matters are even worse than I thought 
they were.
   
Thanks to the Moeen Qureshi precedence, who knows he may be secretly 
praying for the latter to prove true. Probably the truth wont be 
known because in all likelihood Mr Jafarey may sound an angry denial 
about the conversation ever having taken place while Mr Burki would 
like to reserve this right till his second visit to Pakistan since it 
could provide some fresh space on the front pages of the national 
press. 
   
The bottom line, however, remains depressingly clear. It speaks 
volumes about our political paucity when a little media attention on a 
former cricket star or a second level international banker sends 
shivers down the weak spines of our so-called statesmen. Sorry, 
statespersons!.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 8: AgrEvo Pakistan with the turnover of over Rs 2 
billion, ranks second after Ciba, in crop protection business, with 
the market share of 12.5 per cent from its own range.
    
Dr Prante disclosed that the AgrEvo Pakistan would also be marketing 
agrochemicals products of Bayer A G in Pakistan from 1996 onwards, 
which would lift the company's combined market share to around 20 per 
cent. The current product range of AgrEvo, he stated, included 
products for cotton, rice, wheat, pulses and vegetables as well as 
environmental health insecticides.
    
He stated that the company expects to launch 10 new products in the 
next 4-5 years, adding, that the R&D department of AgrEvo Pakistan 
having access to one of the largest Agrochemical Research and 
Development budget in the world and is continuously involved in 
exhaustive testing of new and more environmentally sound products 
under local considerations to ascertain their efficacy and correct 
dosage.
    
He said, projected turnover of 1 billion DM in this region, by the 
turn of this century. Dr Prante lamented that the 10 per cent increase 
in the regulatory duty on agro chemicals, together with the impact of 
7 per cent devaluation of Pakistani Rupee, would be burdensome and 
requested that the government should grant exemption to the crop 
protection products, just as it did for the fertiliser products. Clear 
distinction, he emphasised, should also be made between the research 
based ethical products manufacturers and simple traders.

stayed away. The KSE 100-share price index was last quoted at 1,477.30 
as compared to 1,464.14 at the last weekend as most of the base shares 
managed to finish smartly recovered.
    
Bulk of the support remained centred around Hub-Power, and PTC 
vouchers.   
Most of the investment shares performed well. Leading among them, 
notably ICP mutual funds, and leading banks such as Faysal Bank, MCB, 
Bank of Punjab and Union Bank.
    
Insurance shares rose under the lead of EFU Insurance on news of 
higher earnings and so did some others including American Life.
    
Textiles shares generally fell though fractionally but leading among 
them managed to finish fractionally higher. Synthetic shares were 
actively traded under the lead of Dewan Salman, Dhan fibre and Ibrahim 
Fibre and so did Cement shares, most active them being Lucky Cement 
and D.G.Khan Cement.
    
Hub-Power in the energy sector was massively traded on heavy covering 
purchases and so did some others but leading among them fell under the 
lead of PSO and Pakistan Oil fields. Honda Atlas came in for active 
support and led the list of active auto shares followed by Agriautos 
and Pak-Suzuki Motors.
    
Most of the MNCs in the pharma sector notably ICI Pakistan, Wellcome 
Pakistan, Searle Pakistan, and Reckitt and Colman rose and so did 
Engro Chemicals and Brooke Bond and some others but Lever Brothers 
fell on late selling.
    
PTC vouchers topped the list of most actives, up 65 paisa on 4.598 
million shares followed by Hub-Power, up Rs 1.30 on 4.488 million 
shares, ICI Pakistan, higher Rs 1.30 on 592,200 shares, Lucky Cement, 
firm 55 paisa on 396,000 shares, Faysal Bank, steady 85 paisa on 
390,500 shares, Dhan Fibre, lower 10 paisa on 222,000 shares, Fauji 
Fertiliser, unchanged on 169,000 shares and Ibrahim Fibre, steady five 
paisa on 155,500 shares.
    
Trading volume fell to 18 million shares from the previous 22 million 
shares. There were 366 actives, out of which 173 shares fell, while 
112 rose, with 81 holding on to the last levels.

Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 9: Stocks gave improved performance thanks to active 
follow-up support. The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices 
posted a fresh gain of 11 points at 1,489.60, reflecting the strength 
of the base shares.
    
The investor bullish mood is also evident from the positive response 
to the new issues, which are being heavily oversubscribed, they said 
adding the news that the new floatation of Askari General Insurance 
was heavily oversubscribed as it received Rs 57 million against its 
offer of Rs 25 million is a pointer to the future direction of the 
market.

Dividend news from Dadabhoy Leasing, Pakistan Telephone Cables, and 
First Tawakkal Modaraba, were disappointing and have their toll in 
their respective counters. But the second interim dividend at the rate 
of 10 per cent by EFU General Insurance was well-received in the rings 
as it was quoted further higher.
    
Banks, leasing, investment and most of the ICP mutual funds came in 
for active short-covering and ended recovered and so did insurance 
shares, under the lead of Adamjee, EFU, and New Jubilee Insurance.
    
Textile shares generally fell, although fractionally for want of 
buying support rather than large selling from any quarter. As the 
Dewan Salman, one of the trend-setters in the synthetic sector was 
being quoted on spot basis, the activity in Dhan Fibre and Ibrahim 
Fibre remained modest.
    
Cement and energy shares were traded both ways but some of the leading 
power shares including Sui Northern, Sui Southern, KESC and PSO 
finished with good gains.
    
Honda Atlas was actively traded in the auto sector and so did Ciba-
Geigy, Reckitt and Colman, Cyanamid Pakistan, Engro Chemicals and some 
others. Telecard, Bata Pakistan and Tri-Pack Films were other good 
gainers.
    
But bulk of the two-way activity remained centred around Hub-Power, 
PTC vouchers, Faysal Bank, ICI Pakistan, Lucky Cement and some others.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, off 40 paisa on 8.550 
million shares followed by Hub-Power, easy 40 paisa on 5.157 million 
shares, Lucky cement, up 40 paisa on 1.110 million shares, ICI 
Pakistan, lower five paisa on 0.755 million shares, Faysal Bank, off 
65 paisa on 0.600 million shares, Fauji Fertiliser, up 25 paisa on 
227,500 shares, MCB, up 50 paisa on 111,500 shares and Honda Atlas 
Cars, off 10 paisa on 107,500 shares. There were some other notable 
deals also.
    
Trading volume rose to 21.676 million shares from the overnight 17.619 
million shares thanks to active bouts of buying and selling in 
pivotal.  There were 345 actives, out of which 136 shares rose, while 
143 fell with 66 holding on to the last level.

<a name="ksei">KSE indices move in opposite direction</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 10: Stocks failed to extend the last two sessions 
improvement as investors hastened to take profits despite predictions 
of an extended bull-run.
    
The interesting feature was that both the KSE 100-share index and the 
all share index moved in opposite direction, a phenomenon reflecting 
the performance of the broader market. While the former fell 4.89 
points at 1,483.82, the latter rose 12.66 points at 834.60 from the 
previous 821.94.
    
Bulk of the buying and selling was again centred around Hub-Power and 
PTC vouchers, which together accounted more than a half of the total 
volume.

Both fell fractionally, reflecting that bears have an upper hand after 
taking profits at the early higher levels.
    
Although minus signs dominated the list, some of the leading shares 
maintained their upward drive and were marked further higher, major 
gainers among them being First, second and 4th ICP mutual funds, 
Silver Insurance, Shell Pakistan, Reckitt and Colman and Lever 
Brothers, which posted gains ranging from Rs 2 to 5.
    
Other good gainers were led by International Bank, Alico, Sana 
Industries, Apex Textiles, Crescent Textiles, Nishat Mills, Burshane, 
PSO, General Tyre and some others rising by one rupee to Rs 1.50.
    
Leading losers were led by Dewan Textiles, Shafiq Textiles, Pakistan 
Refinery, Quality Steel and United Insurance, falling by Rs 2 to 4. 
Dewan Salman, which quoted spot remained under pressure and lost 
another Rs 4 on renewed selling by weakholders. Bata Pakistan, 
Philips, Exide Pakistan, Abbott Lab, National Motors, Bank of Punjab, 
MCB, and Adamjee Insurance were other leading losers.

The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, easy 30 paisa 
on 7 million shares followed by Hub-Power, easy 10 paisa on 5.550 
million shares, Lucky Cement, lower 45 paisa on 1.314 million shares, 
Faysal Bank, lower five paisa on 0.5 million shares, ICI Pakistan, 
easy 15 paisa on 0.515 million shares, Sitara Energy, lower 75 paisa 
on 169,500 shares, PICIC, off 45 paisa on 155,500 shares, LTV 
Modaraba, down five paisa on 208,000 shares, and Tri-Pack films, up 20 
paisa on 199,000 shares.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

ATTORNEY-GENERAL Qazi Jameel rang me last week. He does not seem to 
fully comprehend the responsibility vested in him by his office. Being 
the first law officer of the land, he has to be, willy-nilly, accepted 
by the Bar as leader of the profession. He opened up: I read your 
columns assiduously, never miss one. I countered: And having read them 
what do you do? He hummed and he hawed.

He then came to the point, passionately assuring me that he had 
nothing to do with the filing of the writ in the Peshawar High Court 
challenging the appointment of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah a year 
and a half after he was appointed.

But, said I, I never wrote you had anything to do with it. We must all 
presume, I suppose, that it was mere coincidence that this writ was 
filed during the pendancy of the hearing of the 1995 judges case in 
the Supreme Court. That the petitioner Arif Khan, a member of the 
Peoples Partys Lawyers Forum, chose that particular point in time to 
employ a former associate of yours, Barrister Jehanzeb Rahim (whose 
services he can ill afford) to file a writ citing the CJ as the sole 
respondent, without joining the federation. No notice was sent to you, 
the AG. Normal pre-admission procedure was dispensed with and the 
petition was admitted.

Moreover, again coincidentally, at just about the same time, the 
Competent Authority in Sindh ordered that the home of the CJs 
daughter be raided and searched and that his government servant son-
in-law be arbitrarily suspended. Does the government not seem to be 
saying: Do what you are told, or else...

Then, referring to his absence from Pakistan last month ostensibly to 
attend a conference on money laundering, thus successfully obtaining 
an adjournment in the judges case, I reminded the AG that at any given 
time there are at lest a dozen international conferences going on at 
Woolloomooroo and other such important centres around the world to 
which officials can conveniently be despatched. Take Dr Nassim Hassan 
Shah, our former Chief Justice. When, early in 1994 BBs government 
did not want him on the Bench in Pakistan, he was sent abroad on a 
six-week lecture tour to win Kashmir.

Now, over to our neighbours, the Indians, and to how they 
constitutionally appoint their judges.

1981  Autocrat Indiras time. In the Supreme Court of India, Gupta vs 
The Union of India:
    
The constitutional provision for the appointment of a high court judge 
in India is similar to that existing in the Constitution of Pakistan. 
Under Article 217 of the Indian Constitution, a high court judge is to 
be appointed by the President after consultation with the Chief 
Justice of India, the governor of the province, and the Chief Justice 
of the High Court. The question arose as to what was the meaning of 
the word consultation. Did it merely mean a reference to, and 
obtaining the views of, the two chief justices, or did it mean 
something more? By a majority of four to three the court held that:
    
(i) A complete failure to consult the two chief justices was liable to 
render the appointment unconstitutional.
    
(ii) The consultation must be not merely formal but meaningful and 
effective. However, the judicial appointment was essentially an 
executive function and, accordingly, the President, acting in 
accordance with the advice tendered by the cabinet, could refuse to 
follow the advice tendered by the chief justices of the concerned high 
court as well as the Supreme Court.
    
1993. Democrat Narasimha Raos time. In the Supreme Court of India, 
Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association vs. Union of India. With 
the passage of time, informed opinion in India altered, and it was 
decided that the view taken in Guptas case required reconsideration 
to further strengthen the concept of judicial independence. A nine-
Judge bench was constituted in view of the importance of the matter 
and the judgements delivered were couched in dramatic and indeed, in 
certain cases, florid language. One learned judge asked:
    
Whether the present day Solomons Throne (symbolising the majesty 
of our justice system) is fully supported by the Lions (symbolising 
the legislature and executive on both sides)?
    
The court, after much anxious deliberation, overruled the judgment in 
Guptas case and the majority of seven held:
    
(i) That, the proposal for the appointment of a judge, in the case of 
the Supreme Court, must be initiated by the chief justice of India and 
in the case of a high court judge, by the chief justice of the high 
court.
    
(ii) That, in a case in which conflicting views were held by the 
executive and the judiciary, the opinion of the judiciary symbolised 
by the view of the Chief Justice of India would have primacy.
    
(iii) That, accordingly, no appointment of a judge either to the high 
court or to the Supreme Court could be made unless it was in 
conformity with the opinion of the chief justice of India.
    
(iv) That, the principle of seniority as a matter of healthy 
convention ought to be followed.
    
The supreme court, in coming to the above conclusions, referred to the 
earlier applicable sections of the Government of India Act 1935 in 
which there was no provision for a mandatory consultation with the 
chief justices prior to a judicial appointment. The view of the court 
was that Indian Constitution, therefore, provided a deliberate 
departure from the earlier constitutional position. In Guptas case 
the court had earlier concluded that the views of the executive should 
have primacy, a view that was now criticised by holding that the 
reason given, namely, that the executive was accountable to the people 
while the judiciary had no such accountability, was an easily 
exploded myth, a bubble which vanishes on a mere touch. It was 
pointed out that in practice judicial appointments were never 
considered in parliament. Thus, the alleged accountability of the 
executive in such matters was merely theoretical and not actual. It 
was specifically noted that on the other hand, in actual practice, 
the Chief Justice of India and the Chief Justice of the High Court, 
being responsible for the functioning of the courts, have to face the 
consequence of any unsuitable appointment which gives rise to 
criticism levelled by the ever vigilant Bar.
    
The court also took due note of the practice relating to judicial 
appointments followed in England. There, the Lord Chancellor enjoys a 
peculiarly high status and judicial appointments are made by the Prime 
Minister on his advice after following a wide-ranging, although 
informal, process of consultation. In England it is virtually 
inconceivable that incompetent men, lacking integrity, would be 
elevated to the Bench. On one occasion Sir Winston Churchill, while 
addressing the parliament, observed:
    
The service rendered by judges demand the highest qualities of 
learning, training and character. These qualities are not to be 
measured in terms of pounds, shillings and pence according to the 
quantity of work done. A form of life and conduct far more severe and 
restricted than that of ordinary people is required from judges and, 
though unwritten, has been most strictly observed. They are at once 
privileged and restricted. They have to present a continuous aspect of 
dignity and conduct.
    
The restraints which judges have to abide by have to be, in the final 
analysis, essentially self-imposed. In this context, it is worth 
raising the query as to whether the dignity and independence of judges 
is enhanced by their attending functions or dinners held by leading 
dignitaries of the state? Recently, the Prime Minister hosted a lunch 
for the Sindh High Court judges at the State Guest House. Should our 
judges not, without any hesitation, refuse such invitations?
    
Although the constitutional provisions in Pakistan are, broadly 
speaking, similar to those in India, there is one difference. This was 
introduced in the time of General Zia-ul- Haq. The General sought two 
objectives: Islamisation of laws; and weakening of judicial 
independence. Though mutually incompatible, he wanted both. Articles 
203-A to 203-J were introduced into the Constitution to provide for 
the formation of a Federal Shariat Court to decide whether or not the 
various laws of Pakistan were in accordance with the provisions of 
Islam. Tucked away in these Articles was a provision for the transfer 
of high court judges to the Federal Shariat Court, which provided that 
a judge of a high court who did not accept appointment to the federal 
Shariat Court shall be deemed to have retired from his office.
    
Chief Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid of the Sindh High Court paid for his 
independence, and under this provision was moved to the Federal 
Shariat Court. Chief Justice Mian Mehboob of the Lahore High Court, 
when transferred to the Shariat Court, refused to go and retired.
    
Why does Benazir feel constrained to exercise her power under the 
cover of bad laws promulgated under martial law by a man she loathed?
    
Three of our four high courts are presided over by insecure Acting 
Chief Justices who remain seated at the whim of the government and who 
can be removed overnight by the simple issuance of a notification.
    
Political opponents are being victimised. Our jails are overflowing; 
our lives and liberties are endangered. The government has done, and 
will continue to do, its best to see that one way or another the 
judges case now being heard in the Supreme Court is indefinitely 
adjourned. This case is vital to the independence of the judiciary. It 
is up to all of us, the people, to do what each of us can to ensure 
that our judiciary gains full independence from our untrustworthy 
executive.

<a name="thei">Their nostrums for all our ills</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Prof M. Ikram-ul-Haq
and six other signatories of Pakistan Forum Lahore

WE, the undersigned, have been pained to note that a group of six, 
eminent, retired civil-military officers of the country have recently 
deemed it fit to address an open letter to the Prime Minister of 
Pakistan through the Press. This "non-letter" expresses deep concern 
over the increasing politicisation of public services and corruption 
rampant in all departments of the government, and highlights the need 
for the appointment of a Presidential Commission for the restoration 
of the norms of good governance in the country.  

The tying of this aide-memoire its pronounced negative slant, its 
shying away from "the roots of most problems in the past" (military 
rule) in the country for 24 long years, during which power was 
concentrated 
in one hand, accountability to the disenfranchised people was the 
least, its simplistic solution of all ills in the shape of a 
Presidential Commission and its ominous refrain that Pakistan may not 
live into the 21st century, have immeasurably disturbed impartial 
observers.  

The letter has been designed to fuel the fire lit by the opposition 
and certain sections of the Press, which have a vested interest in the 
creation of conditions leading to a martial law in the country. The 
opposition leader daily shouts from housetops that 'Benazir's 
government has dismally failed'; 'the state structure is falling 
apart'; 'anyone but a Bhutto will be acceptable as Prime Minister and 
so on. Having totally failed in the National and Provincial 
Assemblies, despite repeated boycotts, threats of resignations and 
continuing absenteeism of opposition members, desperate calls for 
nation-wide strikes, wheeljams and 'deliverance days', instigation of 
traders for holding back tax payments, direct and indirect appeals to 
army officers to intervene and set things right, the opposition now 
cries itself hoarse for mid-term elections, a national government or 
martial law or presidential form of government.  

Having recklessly plundered the financial institutions of the state 
allowed drug smuggling on an unprecedented scale, completely 
politicised the administration and the judiciary by flooding these 
vital organs of the government with their political protigis, and 
indulged in unparalleled "horse-trading" in the assemblies, the 
opposition appears determined to repeat its performance, by doing all 
it can to paralyse the democratically constituted government.  

Most one-man political organisations and religious groups are busy 
setting up a united front to be counted as third options or pressure 
groups. Altaf Hussain's Mujib-like 'war of liberation' in Karachi, 
controlled from abroad and supported by the opposition leader who, in 
his own ascendant period, set the Mohajirs on the war path, has 
already harmed the country's solidarity and economic well-being 
irreparably, and put the simmering Kashmir problem on the back-burner.  

There are several factors compounding the tense situation, some of 
which deserve a registration. These are: fratricidal activities of 
extremist religious sects and ethnic groups; nearly three million 
Afghan refugees still living in Pakistan, aiding and abetting civil 
war in Afghanistan, paying Pakistan back by their terrorist 
activities, drug and arms smuggling sprees, and fomenting 
fundamentalist religious troubles in the NWFP; unemployment and 
spiralling cost of living in the country; unbridled powers and clout 
of feudal lords and Sardars in rural areas; continuous rumour-
mongering in the name of the freedom of the Press.
  
Prolonged confrontation between the government and the opposition, 
surprisingly belonging to identical political poles, politicisation of 
public services and the deepening morass of corruption, undermining 
the 
credibility of the state machinery, and the crescendo of the 
forebodings of the disintegration of the country, cannot be wished 
away by any quick fixes like the Presidential Commission proposed by 
the honourable Six. 
The situation needs more democracy and not less, an unfettered 
parliamentary democracy and not an Ayub-Yahya-Zia brand of 
presidential system. Bureaucratic prescriptions will never give us 
lasting solutions.
  
Our brief analysis of the situation in Karachi, and the widespread 
corruption in the country, the two key areas spotlighted in the Open 
Letter, may be summed up as follows: 

 i) The dialogue initiated by the government with MQM is a far-sighted 
step which can lead to political reconciliation, on the basis of an 
agreement to be evolved on the holding of local bodies' election in an 
atmosphere free of thuggery and terrorisation of the masses, judicious 
and compassionate review of criminal cases against MQM political 
activists, grant of legitimate share to the MQM in the provincial and 
federal governments, fixing of quotas for admissions to educational 
institutions and for recruitment to the services, and redressal of 
other legitimate grievances of the aggrieved parties. In order that 
the crucial negotiations may restart to conclude meaningfully, 
terrorism of the MQM, orchestrated by Altaf Hussain, must cease. 
Rocket attacks on the Sindh Secretariat, wanton killings of Punjabis 
and Pathans in Karachi, daily ambushes of the police, and interminable 
series of coercive strikes, cannot go side by side with talks with the 
government, for amicable settlement of issues. The leader of the 
opposition must strengthen the hands of the government, representing 
the majority of the people of Sindh, with whom the Mohajirs have to 
live like brothers. We appeal to Altaf Hussain to pursue the dialogue 
initiated by the government, earnestly and with a deep sense of 
urgency.  

ii) Corruption and politicisation of services bred and promoted by 
nepotism, favouritism and feudalism, are the ill-begotten children of 
martial laws in the country, and the bureaucrats are the carriers of 
this deadly virus subverting the health and existence of our country. 
Prolonged martial law regimes and the civil-military bureaucracy, are 
the two fountain-heads of the hydra-headed corruption in this land of 
the pure. Twenty four years of military dictatorship, based on 
coercion, fear, and lack of accountability to the people, has 
distorted and deformed our systems of administration, judiciary, 
revenue collection, political dispensation, education and moral 
values, beyond recognition. 

During military rule, the constitution of the country has been treated 
as 'a piece of paper'; political wheeling and dealing, and bribery was 
the main tool for sustaining the government from day to day; and the 
'public servants' learnt to behave as servants of the dictator and 
masters of the people. The feudal class and bureaucracy are 
the bulwarks and pillars of martial law in the country. All military 
regimes, run by corruption and brute force, invariably unleash 
internecine forces coalescing into another martial law, or a loosening 
of the solidarity of the country, leading to its ultimate break-up. 
Mistrust of the people and corruption are the twin gifts of the
cancer of martial law.

The civil-military bureaucracy has been the hot-bed of corruption in 
our country, right from the days of Ghulam Mohammad to Ghulam Ishaq. 
Through their perpetual Intrigues, lust for power, accumulation of 
vast perks and privileges, and collusion with military dictators, 
colonial powers, and feudal lords, they have reduced Pakistan to a 
poor non-developing country, after 48 years of its turbulent 
existence, without taking the blame for it. They are the ones who 
prevailed upon our military and political rulers to borrow from 
Western countries and spend beyond our means. Thanks to Mehbubul Haq-
Ghulam Ishaq-Sartaj Aziz-Jaffery line-up, controlling our finances, 
our external debt has shot up from five billion dollars in 1977 to 24 
billion dollars in 1995.  

These debts line the pockets of bureaucrats and politicians, and 
contribute nothing to the development of the country towards self-
reliance. From a foodgrain-exporting country, we have now turned into 
a foodgram-importing country in the range of Rs 50 billion annually. 
We are totally dependent on Western countries for our industrial and 
defence needs. Corruption is also bred by our feudal and Jagirdari 
system. Illiterate but moneyed elected representatives thrive on drug-
smuggling and tax-dodging, with immense susceptibility to political 
'horse trading' in the assemblies.  

Recruitment, even of teachers and clerks on the basis of political 
patronage and selections, not to speak of the appointments of police 
inspectors, taxation inspectors, and other functionaries, in complete 
violation of merit and suitability, amounts to the subversion of the 
state machinery. This legacy of the martial law regimes, has now been 
accepted and implemented as an established norm, like the Haj trips at 
government expense and treatments abroad for high-ups, the two gifts 
of bribery given by Zia. The favourites of the feudal elected 
representatives, bureaucrats and party workers-a new elitist and 
corruption-breeding entity are streaming into government offices at 
all levels.  

This mode of corruption must be stopped forthwith. To start with, all 
appointments and promotions, made from 1977 to 1995, on the basis of 
political favouritism, bypassing the merit criteria, should be listed, 
notified and screened. Unless there are exemplary punishments for 
infringements of rules, and a system of accountability for those who 
bend and break the rules, political appointees will continue to 
trickle into different streams.  

The demand for the appointment of a Presidential Commission assumes 
that a Presidential system has already been imposed on the country! We 
are convinced, however, that neither the appointment of a Police 
Commission, nor that of the proposed 'Presidential Commission', to be 
manned by individuals commanding national 'credibility and 
reputation', could restore good governance, efficiency and objectivity 
in public 
administration, and the independence of the judiciary, everyone is so 
enamoured of. Such a step can provide jobs for retired bureaucrats.  

The present political situation in the country cannot be transformed 
through technocratic prescriptions offered by M/s Moeen Qureshi, 
Shahid Javed Burki and Mahbubul Haq, with World Bank credentials, or 
the six retired civil-military bureaucrats. We firmly hold the view 
that the remedy of all political ills of the country lies in a viable 
and transparent parliamentary democratic system, envisioned by the 
Quaid-i-Azam, and built into the 1973 constitution. We should bear in 
mind that yet another military take-over, in the name of good 
governance or Islam, can prove the undoing of the country.

AS the government goes through the motions on centre stage, the cheers 
turn to catcalls and the bouquets to brickbats; but more ominously, 
the muttering in the wings is growing into a chorus.

According to the results of a Gallup poll published recently, 45 
percent of the people surveyed in Pakistan think 1996 will be the same 
or worse than 1995. Compare this with the 10 percent who thought the 
coming year would be worse than the preceding one ,only half a decade 
ago. Clearly, disenchantment and disillusionment with those in charge 
over the last few years are multiplying rapidly. But more 
significantly, there is increasing concern about the viability of the 
system, and a debate about the parliamentary versus the presidential 
forms has now surfaced in the Press.

Proponents of the latter argue that the current instability caused by 
the polarisation between the ruling party and the opposition would not 
be as marked if a strong president was vested with sweeping executive 
authority. Indeed, if the chief executive were elected directly, he or 
she would not be as beholden to parliamentarians and therefore under 
no pressure to constantly indulge in horse-trading. We would then be 
spared the spectacle of bloated and expensive federal and provincial 
cabinets consisting of ministers whose loyalty has been bought with 
portfolios.

I have long argued that simply tinkering with the system is no answer 
because ultimately, the ruling elites will continue to call the 
shots. Also, if we are stuck with a constitutionally powerful 
president who has little regard for the rule of law, there are fewer 
remedies available to us. Our experience of strong presidents who 
enjoyed enormous power by virtue of military support has not been 
salutary. True, the exercise of dictatorial power by generals is not 
necessarily an apt example of a presidential dispensation, but on 
principle, the anarchist in me is against the concentration of too 
much authority in one person.


Experience has shown that constitutional checks and balances do not 
function well in our climate. No doubt, the corruption in the air has 
a corrosive effect.

Institutions like the judiciary and the legislature have been 
systematically emasculated over the years. The recent decision to 
appoint a retired 64-year-old civil servant with no experience in 
audit and accounts as the Auditor-General of Pakistan is an indicator 
of the government's concern for fiscal discipline. And the reported 
heavy-handed tactics being used against the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court show the respect this august body now enjoys. The 
independent Press, despite growing pressures, is the only instrument 
of public accountability still playing its role.

By definition, parliament is supreme in any parliamentary system. 
Unfortunately more or less the same crooked lot get elected time after 
time. If this form of government is to perform reasonably well, it is 
clear that the quality of legislators has to improve significantly 
but, equally clearly, this is not happening. One reason is that the 
mainstream parties award tickets to those candidates who can finance 
their own (expensive) campaigns. But the major cause is the desire of  
voters to elect a representative who can look after their interests. 
They are not concerned with his voting record in parliament or, 
indeed, whether he is honest or not. What the voters expect is that he 
should have the clout to have a road built to their village, an 
electricity connection provided or a government job secured. They are 
not pushed about where he stands on the nuclear issue or whether he 
attended the debate on Kashmir.

In short, a candidate is judged on his executive ability and not his 
parliamentary skills. Those of us who live in cities would not think 
of contacting our representatives for anything. Indeed, how many of us 
even know their names? But the millions who live in villages have no 
option because the Patwari, SDO or SHO pays no attention to ordinary 
citizens. So for them, the acid test is whether a candidate is 
accessible to them after he has been elected, and, secondly, if he is 
effective in solving their day-to-day problems.

In developed democracies, the physical and social infrastructure is 
largely in place, so parliamentarians can concentrate on their real 
task of law-making and acting as watching on behalf of the electorate. 
Here, because of the state's failure to provide the basic necessities, 
public representatives are under pressure to be on the right side of 
the government if they are to keep their constituents happy. So while 
there is the occasional sound and fury in the house, there is a broad 
consensus between the ruling party and the opposition on keeping the 
system intact. It is in neither side's interest to rock the boat and 
when there is a change, it is purely cosmetic, with one lot switching 
places briefly with the other.

While this pragmatic approach by the average voter may go some way to 
addressing his local problems, it is clearly not geared to raising the 
abysmally low level of governance. This transformation can only come 
about by ensuring a better breed of legislators, and this in turn will 
only happen if and when the major parties screen applications from 
candidates for ability and integrity, and the Election Commission 
exercises a tight check on spending limits in election campaigns. But 
since neither mirade will happen very soon, we are forced to examine 
other options.

The strength of the American presidential form of democracy lies in 
its concentration of power on the one hand, and its decentralisation 
by granting tremendous autonomy to the federation states on the other. 
This balance of power between the centre and the states is ensured by 
a complex system of checks and balances which has evolved over two 
hundred years.

The French system combines elements of both forms of government, with 
power divided between the president and the prime minister. However, 
when push comes to shove, the former calls the shots.

But whatever system a nation opts for, ultimately it is the will to 
work according to the letter and the spirit of the original blueprint 
that determines its success. If a constitution is twisted out of shape 
and otherwise undermined by power hungry politicians for whom the rule 
of law has no meaning, no system in the world can guarantee that the 
government of the day will function within designed parameters.

So the answer lies not in changing the system but the attitude of our 
ruling classes.

<a name="indi">Indias grand nuclear design</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Gen Khalid Mahmud Arif (retd) 

DECEMBER 1995 report appearing in the New York Times about the US spy 
satellite observing excessive activity at the nuclear test site at 
Pokharan put India on the spot by disclosing her clandestine activity. 
The satellite images alarmed the US that India might be secretly 
planning either to explode a nuclear device or fine-tune its bomb-
making techniques.
    
Highly speculative, cried India and counter-charged that Washington 
was pressuring it into signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
planned to be negotiated in 1996. India maintains that the CTBT must 
be linked with a firm timetable for achieving nuclear disarmament 
universally. Despite the Indian denial, the Asian Age reported that 
India was set to test-fire at Pokharan surface-to-surface missile 
Prithvi, capable of carrying conventional and nuclear warheads.
    
Both the reports alarmed Pakistan, a victim of Indias covert sabotage 
and overt aggression. The testing of a nuclear bomb or its delivery 
system is designed to promote Indias claim for being accepted as a de 
facto nuclear-weapon power, the close- ended NPT not withstanding. 
Prithvi missile, reaching out to most of the economic and military 
targets in Pakistan, seriously compromises her security and demands a 
policy of a tit for tat. In the face of such a grave danger, Pakistan 
may have to forgo the hitherto observed nuclear self-restraint and 
convert her nuclear capability into a practical reality. Given Indias 
past behaviour the nuclear blackmail by it is an unacceptable option 
for Pakistan.
    
The Indian intentions could be: one, testing its first thermo-nuclear 
weapon design before the CTBT forecloses such a chance for ever; two, 
testing the nuclear warhead for the Prithvi missile; three, cautioning 
the world that an external pressure against Indias nuclear-weapon 
option would be counter-productive; four, diverting the world focus 
from Indias ongoing and projected nuclear and missile-related weapons 
and technology acquisition from Russia; five, eroding the NPT and 
preparing a case for making India its associate member with the rights 
and obligations exercised by the nuclear-weapon powers; six, 
bargaining on the CTBT and demanding its pound of flesh; seven, 
promoting its claim for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council; 
eight, claiming to be treated at par with China; nine, browbeating its 
neighbours and dominating South Asia and beyond; ten, showing of 
chauvinism by Narasimha Rao to gain votes during the coming elections; 
and eleven, refining Indias nuclear weapons and their delivery 
systems.
    
Indias decision-makers may opt for a bang if in their perception the 
resultant world reaction would be muted, India would not be globally 
isolated and the loss of external goodwill and advantages currently 
accruing to it would be transitory in nature. Conversely, India could 
renege under international pressure and/or deny that New Delhi ever 
had an ulterior nuclear intention.
     
A tailor-made excuse could be that the US had either played its usual 
dirty tricks with India or the American intelligence had overplayed 
its hand. In either eventuality Indias immediate purpose  
justification to retain its nuclear- weapon capability  is adequately 
served. The Indian diplomatic and media blitz will henceforth claim, 
as a quid pro quo, political, economic, technological and diplomatic 
concessions from its primary wooers.
    
It is a tribute to Indias political charmers that by cashing in on 
the demise of the Soviet Union they successfully hypnotised the US 
policy makers to look at South Asia largely through the Indian prism. 
By opening up its economy to attract foreign investments India is busy 
shopping in the international weapon bazaar. Massive external 
investments in the economic sector permit India to divert its internal 
resources to the rapidly growing defence budget. In addition, the 
transfer of dual-purpose high-technology to India enables it to update 
its weapon-systems previously acquired from the Soviet Union at 
subsidised rates.
    
The economic assistance and the technology transfers from the US 
amount to destabilising South Asia by arming a known bully. 
Additionally, India is also acquiring military hardware from Russia 
and elsewhere. The growth of its military arsenal increases its 
political arrogance and military appetite. New Delhis intransigence 
with its neighbours and imperial behaviour are the inevitable results.
    
The convergence of the Indo-US interests in keeping China under 
pressure is fully exploited by India in promoting its own designs. On 
the one hand, it claims to settle the age-old Sino-Indian border 
dispute peacefully and on the other, permits the Dalai Lama living in 
India to stab China in the back. India has been vociferous against the 
Chinese nuclear weapon programme in the US policy-influencing and 
policy-making circles and seeking to equate itself with that country 
not withstanding the fact that unlike India China is recognised as a 
nuclear-weapon state.
    
Poverty and power make a dangerous combination. The erstwhile Soviet 
Union is a recent example. The Indian poverty line going back into its 
ancient history, is written large in the streets of its cities, towns 
and villages and on the faces of its population. A gun-wielding hungry 
person poses a threat to himself and to others. Indias internal 
conflicts and dissensions are so numerous, so complex and so 
explosive that at any one time one half of its army is perennially 
deployed on internal security duties in half a dozen disturbed areas 
or more. Its neighbours  all of them  have had a bitter taste of its 
expansionist designs.
    
India does not face any danger from outside but its internal security 
is a different matter. Therein lies the danger for itself and its 
neighbours. India can explode or expand. Neither of this possibility 
may be imminent but the seeds for both exist.
    
The courtship between the recently-westernised India and the newly-
Indianised US might have evoked interest in this country without 
ringing alarm bells if Washington had adopted a fair approach on major 
South Asian disputes. Its credibility in Pakistan, previously suspect, 
has nose-dived in recent times. Be it the nuclear issue, the narcotic 
trade, the human rights violations, terrorism or the Kashmir dispute, 
the US has shown a visible soft corner for India.
    
While America kept mum on the sale of the Russian military aircraft to 
India, it bent backwards to convince New Delhi that the return of some 
repaired Pakistani military hardware to Islamabad would not disturb 
the regional balance (imbalance?) of power. 
   
Likewise, India was rewarded with a security agreement with the US 
after it test-fired Agni and Prithvi missiles. While the Pressler 
Amendment unfairly punishes Pakistan, India, no less unfairly, 
receives security assistance and military cooperation despite its 
expanding nuclear activity. The US policy statements on Kashmir have 
encouraged India to talk tough with and threaten Pakistan. The US 
policy tilt has thus aggravated the security concerns in South Asia. 
Washington would not be blame-free if there is another conflict in 
this region.

Indian machinations, never hidden from Pakistan, now stand exposed to 
the world. Having failed to subdue the freedom movement in Kashmir it 
has launched itself on a Machiavellian path to pursue other options. 
Its imagination ran so wild that when an epidemic broke out in India, 
Pakistan was accused of infiltrating infested rats into the affected 
area. RAW is purposefully vitiating the political climate. The RAW-
sponsored operations  the capture of hostages by the so-called Al 
Faran group and the air-drop of arms in East India  were launched 
with sinister motives to implicate Pakistan.
    
With India breathing fire, Pakistans quarrelling politicians are 
doing their business as usual trading accusations among themselves. 
Therein lies the danger to this country.

<a name="whyf">Why fear trading with India?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
S.M. Naseem

THE debate on opening up trade with India is emotionally charged and 
motivated mainly by a desire to discredit present or past governments, 
rather than for analysing the problem on the basis of the merits of 
the case. Mixing politics with trade is almost as dangerous as mixing 
religion with politics, which is a legacy from which Pakistan is 
finding so difficult to recover. If the politics of the country has 
suffered from the infusion of religious, ethnic and other sectarian 
elements into it, the economy has also been handicapped by the 
intrusion of these extraneous elements in making optimal policy 
choices.
    
Our continued infatuation with the dream of an Islamic economic bloc, 
whose prospects have always been suspect but whose feasibility becomes 
increasingly doubtful with the emerging ditente between Israel and the 
Arabs, has been one of the major reasons why we have failed to take 
seriously the experience of East Asia, notwithstanding the fact that 
it comprises two large Muslim countries.
    
Any casual observer of the international scene of the past two decades 
cannot help being impressed by the fact that countries which have 
succeeded in invigorating their economies and achieving high rates of 
economic growth have done so through increased reliance on foreign 
trade. Moreover, they have done so by diversifying their trade and 
through increased interaction with countries of their own region. 
Political differences have also not stood in the way of closer 
economic ties, especially trade, between nations having a long history 
of hostile political relations. Besides the well-known example of 
Europe, which illustrates that economic ties are not only possible 
between political adversaries but that they also help heal past 
differences and create common bonds of understanding, many other 
instances can also be cited.
    
In more recent times bitter enemies of Japan in East Asia (and often 
of each other), sank their differences and engaged in intensive trade 
with each other in the larger interests of their peoples well-being. 
Despite the political posturing between Taiwan and the Peoples 
Republic of China, a healthy and growing trade and investment 
relationship between the two economies has flourished. Indeed, one is 
hard put to find contrary contemporary examples of nations not 
engaging in trade because of political considerations.
    
Apart from the UN-sanctioned (often US-led trade) embargoes against 
Iraq, Libya and at one time South Africa, the only remaining vestige 
of such politically-motivated trade policy is, ironically, being 
pursued by the US, the leading protagonist of free trade, against Cuba 
and Iran. But that is clearly a case of paranoia which the US nurses 
towards its perceived-enemies. With the signing of the PLO-Israel 
peace agreement, trading relations between the Arab states and Israel 
are fast developing.
    
It is, therefore, difficult to understand why Pakistan should stand 
out as the only significant developing country to practise a 
politically-inspired trade policy, if only against one country. 
Indeed, there would be some strength in the argument for generalised 
trade restrictions to enable the country acquire a sufficiently strong 
industrial base before it launches itself into the uncharted waters of 
free trade in international competition. Unfortunately, the time for 
that argument has come and gone and our policy makers have frittered 
away the opportunities provided to them by the international trading 
system during successive regimes which promoted their own narrowly-
focused, self-serving economic agenda rather than work towards the 
creation of a viable economic base which could stand international 
competition.
    
Short of becoming totally isolated from the global economy for a 
considerable period of time, Pakistan does not now have the option of 
turning the clock back and attempting to regain the missed 
opportunities of the past.
    
With the completion of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the 
World Trade Organisation, all trading signatories of the Marrakesh 
declaration are obliged to accord each other MFN treatment and have 
agreed to reduce their tariff levels significantly over time. Such 
reduction is intended to greatly increase the volume of trade and 
result in more mutually beneficial pattern of comparative advantage. 
While the Marrakesh agreement is heavily tilted in favour of 
industrialised countries by virtue of their predominant position in 
world trade, the developing countries have managed to extract, through 
years of detailed negotiations during the Uruguay Round, the minimal 
concessions needed for the maintenance of a free trade environment.

Another source of increase in international trade as an impetus for 
growth is the formation of regional cooperation in trade and 
investment, which has assumed increasing importance in most regions of 
the world, with the exception of South Asia. While SAARC has been in 
existence for well over a decade and has carried out some important 
activities, its achievements so far have been well below its inherent 
potential. Its main role has so far been in promoting exchange of 
visits, information and experience  activities, which, while 
seemingly trivial, can have a substantial value in the promotion of 
intra-regional cooperation.
    
However, such activities have to be accompanied by greater 
liberalisation in trade and economic exchanges and, in due course, 
also by an overall improvement in political relations of cooperating 
countries. In the absence of the latter provisos, the mere promotion 
of cultural and professional exchanges could have a negative effect on 
the perception of people in cooperating countries as waste of 
resources. It is, therefore, necessary that concerted efforts for 
economic cooperation are not put off for too long; cosmetic essays in 
public relations are no substitute for these.
    
The major stumbling block in SAARCs progress as a regional economic 
cooperation organisation is the poor and worsening state of political 
relationships between the two largest economies of the SAARC namely, 
India and Pakistan. Unless there is a significant improvement in this 
relationship, SAARCs image as a regional economic cooperation 
grouping will remain lacklustre and its high potential will not 
materialise. The lack of mutual trust between India and Pakistan 
affects the overall functioning of the organisation, since, as 
envisaged in its original charter, decisions at all levels in the 
organisation have to be taken on the basis of unanimity.
    
Economic cooperation in South Asia has also been inhibited to some 
extent by the fear among some of the smaller countries in the region 
that India being the largest economy in the region, is likely to 
receive a disproportionately high share of any gain accruing from such 
cooperation. These fears are not without substance, but are often 
exaggerated by those industries and sectors in the economy which are 
likely to lose, while the potential beneficiaries, by far the more 
dynamic elements in the economy, who have been denied patronage and 
access to resources, have little voice in policy formulation. The main 
thing to recognise is that while there are likely to be both gainers 
and losers from increased trade with India and other countries, the 
country itself is unlikely to be a loser, even if its bilateral trade 
balance with one or some of the countries worsens and can be dispelled 
by giving adequate safeguards for any adverse effects caused to the 
national economy of smaller countries. For unless a country is grossly 
inefficient, growing trade is an increasing and not a zero-sum game, 
in which both trading partners can gain.
    
Increased and diversified trade with new trading markets under the MFN 
or other concessional trade regimes will not give rise to the need for 
some restructuring of the domestic economy and refashioning of 
comparative advantage. This is going to be inevitable for Pakistan 
whose comparative advantage has been frozen since its early 
nationalisation in the 1950 and 1960s in favour of a few basic and un-
specialised commodities. This pattern of comparative advantage is 
likely to crumble under the weight of more liberalised trade mandated 
by the Uruguay Round. To try to resist such restructuring on the plea 
that our industries will be swamped by Indian goods is counter-
productive. India does not, after all, have a high competitive edge 
compared to other countries we will be opening our trade to. Under the 
pressure of competition, we may acquire a better competitive edge and 
be forced to develop market niches in other countries, including 
India, which our industrialists have not had any motivation for doing 
because of a captive domestic market and assured markets in low 
quality exports.
    
Despite these fears of smaller countries, SAARC adopted the agreement 
on SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) at the 7th SAARC 
summit in Dhaka in April 1993. However, it has taken more than two 
years for its final adoption, with Pakistan being among the last to 
ratify. Pakistans continued reservations cast doubts on the agreement 
becoming operational soon. If and when it does become operational, the 
product-by-product approach in SAPTA is unlikely to make any 
significant difference to the existing low levels of intra-regional 
trade which is only three per cent of their total trade. As pointed 
out in a recent ESCAP study, a bold across-the-board preferential 
trade agreement on transit and trade to promote intra-SAARC trade is 
required, which undoubtedly will benefit to all the countries as well 
as stimulate the economic growth of the region. It is significant 
that Nepal, a small least developed economy, has beckoned the way by 
announcing a 10 per cent preferential tariff reduction on all imports 
from the SAARC region. Similar bold measures, perhaps proportional to 
the size of each regional economy, could pave the way for a vigorous 
increase in intra-SAARC trade.

By adopting a negative attitude towards the expansion of trade with 
SAARC in general and India in particular, Pakistan is letting slip a 
unique opportunity of providing the economic and trade leadership to a 
region which has a large potential of becoming a dynamic economic 
force in the next century. Not long ago, India used to be afraid of 
being ganged up against by the smaller nations in SAARC; Pakistans 
attitude is likely to dissipate this fear. A much bolder and less 
diffident strategy on the part of Pakistan could shame India into 
making larger concessions in SAPTA and in making SAARC a truly dynamic 
region. The two countries need to engage in an economic and trade 
competition, instead of the senseless arms race that provides no real 
security to the people of either country.
    
In this respect, as in many others, SAARC can benefit from the ASEANs 
experience, which is widely recognised as the most enviable example 
for conducting regional economic cooperation among geographically 
contiguous, politically independent nation states of medium size. 
Among the most important achievements of the ASEAN have been the 
creation of an economic and political environment in the region under 
which normal economic relations can take place without a threat of the 
eruption of an armed conflict among member countries within the 
region. ASEAN countries played an important role not so much in 
directly solving but in defusing bilateral conflicts of their members. 
They perceived regional peace in terms of public good whose existence 
benefits all member countries and whose absence causes considerable 
loss of resources that could better be utilised elsewhere. This is a 
major lesson that SAARC countries, especially its two chief 
adversaries, could profitably emulate.
    
This public good aspect of regional peace is particularly important in 
an era when foreign direct investment is playing a major role in the 
industrialisation and development of developing countries. A major 
factor influencing multinational firms decisions to undertake foreign 
investment is the existence of peace and law and order in areas where 
they invest.

<a name="will">Will India heed the warning?  </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

WASHINGTON'S warning to India not to persist in its move to conduct 
yet another nuclear explosion has not come a day too soon. There 
should not be the slightest doubt that if New Delhi went ahead with 
its plans, it would trigger a dangerous nuclear arms race in the 
region, the implications of which are too frightening to contemplate. 
The United States has reportedly conveyed to New Delhi that if it 
carried out the planned nuclear test, it would open itself to severe 
economic and trade sanctions under the 1994 Proliferation Preventive 
Act, and have assistance from the world finance bodies cut off. The 
point to note here is that Washington would not have administered a 
stern warning unless it was fairly convinced, on the basis of 
evidence, that India was in fact planning to conduct a second nuclear 
test explosion-after its first in 1974. The message from Washington 
should be expected to put the Indian government in a sober frame of 
mind and persuade it to reconsider the active pursuit of its bloated 
nuclear ambitions.  

However, since information on the exact nature of Washington's warning 
continues to be somewhat vague and sketchy, the countries of the 
region, especially Pakistan, are entitled to be clearly informed of 
the United States' stand in the matter. The US has kept Islamabad 
under pressure for years, through the highly discriminatory device of 
the Pressler law, excluding it from all economic and military 
assistance. All this while, India has defiantly opposed the signing of 
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT) and entering into any 
regional or bilateral (with Pakistan) arrangement to prevent the 
spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology in South Asia. 
Pakistan, on its part, has repeatedly offered to accept any 
restrictions on its nuclear development programme which are equally 
applicable to India.  

To no one's surprise, there have been reports suggesting that India 
could be expecting to use veiled threats of reneging on its commitment 
to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), due some time this 
year, to drive a bargain for extracting certain concessions for 
itself. If this is what India is angling for, it would be preposterous 
to offer any quid pro quo as a "reward", such as a permanent seat on 
the UN Security Council or possible US assistance in nuclear and space 
research, merely to ensure India honouring its commitment to non-
proliferation. Conduct of international relations would no longer be 
regarded as reasonably fair and principled if India, or any other 
country for that matter, is allowed to get away with such blackmailing 
tactics. Some US officials appear to believe that the warning 
administered by Washington may have already prompted New Delhi to back 
off from its proposed nuclear explosion. There is no tangible basis so 
far for such speculation, however, particularly because it is widely 
believed that India's prime minister, Narasimha Rao, may be hoping to 
shore up his sagging popularity ahead of next April's elections by 
upstaging his main rival, the ultra-nationalistic Bharatiya Janata 
Party (BJP), whose manifesto calls for a full-fledged nuclear weapons 
programme for India.  

In this context, it must be stated without the slightest equivocation 
that Pakistan would under no circumstances knuckle under international 
pressure and accept a situation in which only India possesses the 
nuclear weapon, particularly in view of the fact that New Delhi 
already enjoys a clear edge over Pakistan in regard to conventional 
weapons. New Delhi knows fully well that its genuine security needs do 
not call 
for a nuclear arsenal. In spite of this, if it goes ahead with its 
planned nuclear test explosion, it would only confirm India's 
hegemonic ambitions in the region which it wants to prop up by its 
nuclear might. Should India go ahead with its nuclear test, it will 
destroy the present, delicate informal nuclear restraint regime in the 
South Asian region. This in turn could mark the beginning of a 
perilous nuclear arms race in a region, which, in any case, has been 
on the brink of military confrontation for some time. If major powers, 
such as the US, expect their warnings to be taken seriously, they must 
be prepared to use all the political, diplomatic and economic means at 
their command to obtain compliance with the needed restraint.

<a name="vigi">Vigilance or vendetta?</a>

Omar Kureishi

IN other times and days gone by when we were less cynical and not 
quite as earnest as we have become, the disclosure by a political 
columnist that four journalists had been picked up by the police in 
Islamabad for having some cans of beer in their car on New Years Eve 
would have been considered a premature April Fool joke, a kind of 
spoof.
    
But I checked it out and it happened for real. I have read the column 
and though it reeks of sarcasm, an undercurrent of justified 
indignation runs through it. I agree that it is not funny at all and 
the incident has all the hallmarks of a set-up, and a pretty clumsy 
set-up at that.
    
But why should we assume the worst? Why not take the best case 
scenario. There were beer cans in the car of the journalists and in 
the jargon of the police it was a fair cop. If that indeed is the 
case, then the police are deserving of our congratulations. It shows 
the police to be hawk-eyed vigilant. Thousands of cars ply the roads 
of Islamabad and yet the police were able to pick a needle from a 
haystack. Was it luck that they were able to pick up a car that was 
carrying contraband goods out of thousands of cars or was some high-
class sleuthing involved?
    
The law of probabilities is against the police if the check was 
random, improbable but not impossible. It goes beyond the remarkable 
and borders on the miraculous. But people do win a lottery against 
similar odds.
    
Somehow I feel that it did not quite happen this way. And one 
sincerely hopes that an appropriate probe of the incident will be 
made, as promised. But the probe must be thorough because an extremely 
important principle is involved. There is first of all the fundamental 
rights of individuals and contrary to what many people might think, 
journalists are not a special breed and they enjoy neither greater nor 
lesser rights. They cannot or must not be targeted because of the 
nature of their profession. Freedom of the Press is more than a 
compact between the government and the media. It goes to the very core 
of a democratic society for it involves the right of the people to 
know.
    
It has to be accepted that freedom of the Press means that there will 
be criticism, that a certain amount of scepticism will be shown to 
official versions. It is true that freedom of the Press has never 
meant licence, the right to cry fire in a crowded hall but those who 
choose to be in the public domain must learn to accept a certain 
amount of heat.
    
Whether the four journalists who were picked up by the police had 
indeed cans of beer in their car or whether others scores were being 
settled is for the probe to decide. The credibility of the police is 
also involved and the senior officials must ensure that if there has 
been some hanky-panky then exemplary punishment must follow. Let this 
be a test case. Who knows it could be a defining moment in re-
establishing trust between the police and the public. I have written 
several columns in which I have made a special point of lamenting the 
lack of trust between the police and the public. The police are not 
perceived as friends and the sight of a policeman far from being 
reassuring is intimidating. This is no way to get a lawful society.
    
But something else is involved. Our country, like many other 
countries, is in the grip of terrorism, both domestic and 
international. Only recently we have had the bombing of the Egyptian 
Embassy in Islamabad and the blast in Peshawar. 
   
Both deadly serious in every sense, including literally, and both 
cowardly in the extreme. Although investigations are going on and 
there are many theories as to who may have been responsible, it cannot 
be claimed that the cases have been solved. if track records are 
anything to go by, we cannot be too optimistic.
    
One must accept that both in the bombing of the Egyptian Embassy and 
in the blast in Peshawar, the police and other agencies were caught 
napping. The same must go for acts of terrorism in Karachi. There is 
no doubt that there is an information failure. Yet we find an almost 
oppressive police presence in the major cities and motorists and 
motor-cyclists are stopped and searched almost on a whim. It would not 
matter if we were getting results but obviously we are not, for there 
seems to be no end to the violence, certainly in Karachi, and the 
public feels it is being needlessly harassed. Besides, pitted against 
professional and highly trained terrorists, these efforts seem 
amateurish.
    
The fight against terrorism must be based on solid information and our 
agencies have to be one step ahead. But most of all you have to have 
the people behind you and not at odds with one another. It is a matter 
of regret that the political parties have not closed ranks on this 
single agenda of terrorism. Terrorism is not only a crime against the 
state, it is a crime against the people of this country. The victims 
of terrorism are innocent men, women and children. Forty-five precious 
lives were lost in Peshawar besides scores who were injured.
    
The dead are gone and beyond suffering, in this world at any rate, but 
those that are left behind must reckon with the consequences, their 
own lives that have been devastated. Can anyone justify this barbaric 
act, can anyone say that means justified the ends, that the cause was 
more just than the right to life of those who lost that right? Nobody 
can justify murder.
    
Again, there is the perception that a good deal of snooping is going 
on and Big Brother is watching. Much of this may be imaginary. I do 
know that many people who consider themselves to be people of 
consequence are extra careful when talking on the telephone. This is 
particularly true of Islamabad. Even sitting in the coffee shop of the 
citys five-star hotel one gets the feeling that one is being watched. 
It may be nonsense, just a fit of self-importance. But if the agencies 
are alert, then it is a good thing for it means that they are on the 
job which is to hold our enemies at bay.
    
The question arises: when it comes to the crunch, like the bombing of 
the Egyptian Embassy or the blast in Peshawar, all this supposed 
surveillance doesnt seem to amount to much. Yet we are led to believe 
that the police are able to nab four journalists who happen to have 
some cans of beer in their car! Why not this same vigilance against 
more serious enemies? Find those with bombs in their cars.

<a name="copi">Coping with diabetes</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

THE warning that diabetes has acquired epidemic proportions in 
Pakistan needs to be taken seriously. The warning has been sounded by 
the Secretary-General of the Diabetic Association of Pakistan who was 
addressing a seminar on management of diabetes, in Karachi. He based 
his warning on the fact that 12 per cent of the population in the age 
group of 25 years or above suffered from the debilitating disease. 
Forty per cent of the people who have been living with the disease for 
more than 15 years could become incapacitated from complications 
arising from diabetic conditions and many of them may even die 
prematurely if not treated or cared for properly. The statistics are 
indeed fearful as diabetes is yet a disease which cannot be prevented 
or completely cured; it can only be kept under control, which puts an 
awesome burden on the patient as well as his family members. Many 
diabetic patients die of heart complications and 36 per cent of the 
cases of blindness in Pakistan are attributed to this disorder.  

Although diabetes is one of the oldest known ailments, our knowledge 
about it is still very rudimentary. In fact, in developed countries, 
half of the diabetic patients do not know that they are suffering from 
the disease. In the under-developed countries four out of every five 
diabetic patients are ignorant of the nature of the disease they are 
afflicted with. This lack of knowledge, and the required facilities 
and services, increases the dangers from diabetes. Therefore to spread 
knowledge and to make people conversant with the essential do's and 
don'ts of management and control is imperative. 

Fortunately efforts are not lacking in Pakistan although a great deal 
more needs to be done to make people conscious on a wider scale. In 
spite of the fact that education plays an important role in the 
prevention and management of diabetes, there are millions in the 
country whose knowledge about the disease is as scanty as can be 
imagined. The people have to pay a very high price in impaired health 
and very many complications and disabilities that emanate from it for 
this lack of knowledge. Moreover, the absence of adequate health care 
facilities in the country, especially in the rural areas, make people 
easy prey to this and a host of other afflictions. The situation can 
be improved with the spread of education in general and knowledge 
about diabetes in particular. There is urgent need for the health 
authorities to pay more attention to this problem and set up the 
required medical and counselling facilities and services for the 
benefit of diabetic patients.

<a name="thet">The task before the NFC</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

THE task of the National Finance Commission (NFC), appointed by the 
President recently on the expiry of the tenure of the previous one, is 
infinitely more difficult and complex than what its predecessors ever 
faced. It is required to allocate very scant revenues between the 
Centre and the provinces and among the provinces in the face of highly 
exaggerated expectations. The financial position of the federation and 
the provinces has reached a stage where even moderate claims tend to 
outstrip the available resources. The present financial crisis is 
largely the result of accumulation of huge debts by the federation 
over the years, so much so that 50 per cent of the federal revenues 
are gobbled up by debt servicing. Provincial finances are also under 
severe strain for two reasons. First, provinces have for long been 
very niggardly towards education, health and maintenance of assets, 
with the result that the demands of these have now become too pressing 
to be ignored or postponed any longer. Second, provinces never made 
any serious efforts to mobilise resources falling within their 
jurisdiction. They remained entirely dependent on federal tax 
assignments and grants-in-aid. During the last four years, provincial 
tax and non-tax receipts increased, on average, by only four percent 
annually. On the other hand, federal tax assignment rose by 22.5 
percent.  

Adding to its predicament, the NFC is faced with the absence of exact 
statistics of population which was in the past, the sole criterion for 
distribution of resources among the provinces. Census was due in 1991; 
it could not be held as scheduled, nor is it likely to be held in the 
near future. Neither are statistics on inter-provincial migration 
available. These two missing elements make population as a basis for 
distribution of revenues highly questionable. In this situation the 
provinces would plead for the expansion of the divisible pool, while 
the smaller provinces would want the NFC to adopt a new set of 
criteria, comprising, besides population, geographic spread, 
development levels, etc., of different provinces for reasons of 
equity. In view of the highly precarious financial position of the 
federation (debt-servicing and defence consuming almost all revenues), 
the President, in NFC's terms of reference has excluded receipts from 
excise duties from the divisible pool and also asked the Commission to 
examine the question of continuation of payments of royalties on crude 
oil and surcharge on natural gas.  

Exclusion of excise duties, royalty and surcharge, if accepted, would 
substantially reduce the pool and consequently the shares of the 
provinces, especially those of Balochistan and Sindh. The shrinkage 
would be greater if the federation insists its own share to be raised 
from 20 per cent to 30 per cent. In the present political environment 
and in view of the claimant needs of the provinces, these exclusions 
and federal share enhancement are neither practical nor advisable. 
Demands of the provinces for payment of royalties on account of ports 
and cotton and rice production seem almost frivolous. At any rate, the 
finances of the federation do not allow consideration of such demands 
at this stage. The Commission will have to attempt a balance between 
the claims and needs of the Centre and the provinces on the one hand 
and the availability of tax receipts on the other. The finances of one 
cannot, and should not, be strengthened at the expense of the other.  

What the NFC should do this time is to specify sources which the 
provinces must tap for increasing their revenues. They have not so far 
touched the source which the Constitution has exclusively reserved for 
them-income from farming, which constitutes 25 per cent of the gross 
national product. Similarly, the source of non metropolitan town 
properties for revenues has not been properly tapped. There may be 
many other sources which need to be discovered and developed to 
improve provincial finances. As for fixation of inter-provincial 
shares, the issue is complicated and sensitive. Population alone was 
never an appropriate criterion and, in any case, the demographic 
statistics are now totally out of date. Rough estimates of population 
may be considered as one of the factors. Others to be taken into 
consideration are area and the level of development of a province and, 
as an incentive, its efforts to mobilise its own resources.  

Fiscal equity demands weightage in favour of the poor. Hence backward 
and underdeveloped areas have a proportionately better claim than 
others. Similarly, creation of physical and social infrastructure and 
provision of utilities in a sparsely populated area require large 
resources than in thickly populated regions. These two factors should 
become important components of the new criteria. Some weightage needs 
to be assigned to individual efforts of the provinces to raise 
revenues. For that purpose, the federation may set aside a portion of 
funds for distribution in proportion to the ratios in which the 
provinces raise additional revenues each year. Although assignment for 
local bodies is not included in the terms of reference of the NFC, a 
time has come when opportunities for grass-roots participation in 
efforts for raising resources and for implementation of the 
development programme should be provided. The Commission should, 
therefore, devise some formula for drawing local governments into the 
process of development.

<a name="calc">Calculated Terror</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

OVER and above the daily dose of violence and strife which has plagued 
life in Karachi for many years, Sunday's bomb explosion in a public 
bus is a stunning indicator of the extent of mindless mayhem to which 
the city now stands almost helplessly exposed. The explosion resulted 
in the death of seven persons and serious injuries to 35 others. The 
faceless purveyors of death and destruction struck at the unsuspecting 
busload of people in the peak traffic hour of the afternoon. Some of 
the critically injured may have been disabled for life and, therefore, 
reduced to and impoverished existence. The extent of the havoc wrought 
by the explosion may take time to assess as many of the bodies were 
charred beyond recognition and parts of others lay scattered in the 
debris as the Edhi workers and other volunteers rushed to the scene of 
the incident. The ordeal of many of the wounded passengers, even after 
they had been rescued, was compounded when they were rushed to the 
Jinnah Hospital which was reportedly quite unprepared to cope with an 
emergency of that magnitude. Reports spoke of a shortage of doctors 
and nursing staff and the hospital ran out of some vital life-saving 
medicines.

Any attempt at apportioning blame for the-outrage amongst the many 
groups and factions practising violence and terror would at this stage 
be a meaningless exercise, especially in the absence of some new 
efforts either to stem the tide of violence or to resolve the 
underlying causes of the violent conflict. Far more important is the 
need to mount a new initiative to put an end to the vicious circle of 
violence and counter violence that has trapped Karachi for long: As a 
starter, there has to be a moratorium on violence agreed to by all 
parties involved in the conflict. The respite thus obtained may 
provide the opportunity for coming to grips with the causes of popular 
discontent and alienation in Karachi. That would, of course, call for 
a resumption of a dialogue-and not a pantomime -between the government 
and the MQM who between them hold the key to the restoration of peace 
and normality to Karachi.

<a name="them">The MQM-PML intent</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M.H. Askari

THE full implications of the agreement reached between the MQM and the 
Pakistan Muslim League during Mr Nawaz Sharifs recent visit to London 
are still not quite clear, but the development could mean a fresh wave 
of turmoil in Sindh, particularly in Karachi and Hyderabad, and that 
is a prospect that cannot be viewed with any sense of equanimity.
    
The joint statement issued by the two leaders in London deplored the 
atrocities and brutalities suffered by the Mohajir community in 
Sindh, specially Karachi, and called for putting an end to the present 
state of affairs by bringing about an immediate change of government 
through a demonstration of the will of the people.
    
In a language which is an uncomfortable reminder of the rhetorics 
used during the erstwhile PNA movement, directed against Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto after the 1977 elections, the joint MQM-PML statement spoke of 
the national duty of the people to get the country out of its 
present mess. While the alienation of the Mohajirs from the mainstream 
of national politics began largely with the launching of the Operation 
Cleanup in Sindh in June 1992, when a government headed by Mr Nawaz 
Sharif was at the helm of affairs, it is undeniable that the Mohajirs 
have been pushed to the brink in more recent years. Little has been 
done by the PPP leadership to endear itself to the Mohajir community, 
large segments of which now suffer from an acute sense of persecution 
at the hands of the law enforcement agencies.
    
There are armed cadres of militants operating in Karachi (and many 
other parts of Sindh) under the umbrella of almost every political 
party and faction. Yet, more often than not, almost every act of 
violence in Karachi or Hyderabad is blamed on the MQM and its 
activists. There have even been insinuations that MQM militants could 
have been involved in the bomb explosion in a bus in Karachi last 
Sunday. However, the Sindh chief minister, Syed Abdullah Shah, blamed 
the outrage on elements who want to spread chaos and disturb the peace 
in the country. He did not point an accusing finger at any particular 
group or faction. In any case, the MQM leader, Altaf Hussain, promptly 
expressed a deep sense of horror at what he termed as the worst form 
of terrorism.
    
It is clear that the PML has a great deal to gain from the compact 
with the MQM, which will give the party a foothold in urban Sindh. 
(The PML has already the support, even though it may not be so overt 
at times, of the large number of Punjabi settlers in rural Sindh and 
among the labour in cities such as Karachi). Mr Nawaz Sharif and his 
party colleagues are campaigning hard for the Sanghar by-election and 
his claim that the political pattern has changed in the interior of 
Sindh also apparently arises out of the support he expects from the 
MQM apart from some dissident groups of the PPP.
    
Mr Nawaz Sharif has claimed that his lengthy discussions with Mr Altaf 
Hussain in London led to a consensus on possible ways and means of 
tackling the complicated situation in Karachi and Hyderabad. 
However, the MQM has to evaluate the prospective gain (or loss) 
arising out of the London talks from its own point of view and what 
they could mean to the future of the Mohajirs and the MQM in the long 
term. After what the PPP spokesman and the prime minister herself have 
said, there should be no doubt that the Altaf Hussain-Nawaz Sharif 
deal is viewed by the ruling party as a conspiracy to subvert the 
democratic process.
    
What the London statement apparently envisages is a mass struggle to 
bring the government down. It has warned the people that if they 
remained silent or inactive at the present juncture, incalculable 
damage may befall the country. These are ominous signals and could be 
interpreted to mean that the struggle that is envisaged would not be 
entirely peaceful or democratic. The MQM should be expected to ask 
itself the question: whether after all that has been happening such a 
programme to dislodge the government which happens to be in power 
would be in its larger interest or not.
    
Mr Nawaz Sharifs record, judging from the policies followed by his 
government when it was in power last time cannot be regarded as 
exactly compassionate towards the position of the Mohajirs in Sindh. 
He quietly manipulated a rift between the MQM and the PPP after they 
had forged an alliance after the 1988 elections but coolly dumped the 
MQM three and a half years later when he found it expedient to impose 
the Operation Cleanup. Whether the Operation was launched at his 
behest or under pressure from the army, which is what has sometimes 
been argued, the fact is that it was the Mohajirs and the MQM who 
suffered an irretrievable setback once the operation had been 
launched. The MQM was split into two factions almost simultaneously 
and there has been nothing but the most bitter relations between them 
ever since. A great deal of killing which Karachi has had to witness 
subsequently has in fact been a direct manifestation of this rift.

It must also be recalled that the late Gen Asif Nawaz went on record 
to say that the Operation Cleanup would be limited to a few months, 
with the sole objective of restoring law and order in Sindh, and that 
a package of social, political and economic reforms would be needed to 
remove the basic cause of unrest and disaffection in Sindh to ensure 
more durable peace and stability. The reforms could justifiably have 
been considered the responsibility of the government at the helm (and 
not the military authorities) but they never came about. In fact, the 
situation was allowed to further deteriorate.
    
However, there have been suggestions that it was Gen Asif Nawaz 
himself who obstructed the implementation of the proposed reforms, 
ostensibly to maintain and, if possible, to strengthen and enlarge the 
hold of the military over civil affairs. Now that the General is dead, 
there is no way to know what exactly was the substance of such a 
suspicion. There were admittedly statements by Choudhry Nisar, one of 
Mr Nawaz Sharifs cabinet colleagues, asserting that the army had gone 
beyond its mandate. But even if this is considered valid, the 
responsibility really lay with the government.
    
It is also a fact that at an early stage of the Operation Cleanup a 
list of some 77 patharedars had been drawn up so that they could be 
apprehended in the interest of future law and order. To the best of 
ones recollection, no action was taken by the government against the 
patharedars. Even more relevantly, there is little evidence that the 
intelligentsia and power elite in Punjab, which should be regarded as 
Mr Nawaz Sharifs main source of political strength, have demonstrated 
any particular compassion or sympathy for what the Mohajirs and the 
MQM have been going through in the recent years. On the contrary, 
there has been plenty of contempt for the political ambitions of the 
Mohajirs and some of the leading intellectuals in Lahore and Islamabad 
have even started a debate on whether or not the Mohajirs were 
justified in their claim of having spearheaded the Pakistan movement 
at considerable sacrifice to themselves or of upholding the ideals for 
which Pakistan, according to their own concept of it, was created.
    
A leading (Punjabi) intellectual author has even suggested that the 
attitude of mind, which the Mohajirs brought to Pakistan with them and 
which expressed in their own perceived right to impose their language 
and culture on the people of Pakistan, amounted to Pakistan being 
expected to live under an alien culture. This, one hopes, represents 
only a minority view and is not representative of the overall thinking 
in Punjab and other parts of Pakistan. However, the Mohajirs must 
realise that, being largely concentrated in Sindh, their political 
future lies in Sindh. There is no denying that there are elements in 
Sindh who continue to regard them as intruders and outsiders. 
There is also no doubt that the PPP, with its base support in Punjab 
having been largely eroded, may want to, for reasons of expediency, 
identify itself with hard-line Sindhi nationalists and, in the 
process, even adopt an adversarial attitude towards the Mohajirs and 
the MQM. However, in their own interest, the MQM leadership would be 
ill advised to give up its efforts to maintain some sort of 
communication with the saner elements within Sindh and possibly even 
the PPP.
    
On its part, the PPP leadership should realise that there can be no 
durable peace in Sindh so long as a large section of its population 
(i.e. the Mohajirs) remain discontented or alienated. It has been 
recognised by the government more than once, even at the level of the 
President of Pakistan, that the problem of Sindh is basically 
political and a political solution has to be found for the restoration 
of peace and calm.
    
There has to be a moratorium on the use of force to achieve a 
political aim, on the part of all parties concerned. The government 
should in fact be expected to provide the lead in this regard. The 
apparently unending hunt for so-called terrorists and their alleged 
foreign link can only complicate matters. Statements indicting the MQM 
was solely responsible for containing violence in Karachi can serve 
little practical purpose.
    
There are elements in the Sindhi society, both ethnic Sindhis and new 
Sindhis (viz: Mohajir), who earnestly yearn for peace. A group of 
about a hundred leading intellectuals, writers, social workers, human 
rights activists, both Sindhis and Mohajirs, issued an appeal last 
month, stressing the commonality of interests which makes it 
inevitable for all those living in Sindh to regard one another as 
their full partners in the movement for peace and harmony. The appeal 
has somehow not received the notice that it deserved. What is needed 
is a full- pledged crusade for restoring sanity among all sections of 
people and defeat the forces of divisiveness.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="holl">Pakistan, Holland clash in youth hockey final</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, Jan 5: Pakistan will play Holland in the final of World 
Youth Hockey Festival here at Army Hockey Stadium on Saturday at 230 
p.m. In two distinctive pre-finals Pakistan and Holland rallied to 
identical 3-0 triumphs against Japan and Belgium respectively, with 
the difference that while the Dutch secured the match in the first 18 
minutes Pakistan did it in the last 18 minutes of the game in front of 
a moderate crowd gathered to witness the clash.

Pakistan made heavy weather of the first session in which credit 
should also go to ever agile Japanese who successfully tightened off 
hot favourites fluent combination inside the 2S yard zone. Their 
defence and their goalkeeper Seiji Okada excelled to keep the hot 
favourites without success in the first half.

In the first session Pakistan was seen struggling to push 40, with the 
opponents utilising their stimulating physical fitness to restrict the 
individual brilliance of hosts' strikers. First time tackling and 
passing of ball by the Japanese made Pakistani forward line lethargic 
as Captain Khalid with left wing Babar and the right trio of 
Zakirullah-Imran-Farooq kept their heads down-to manoeuvre an opener. 
More significantly it was Pakistan's failure on penalty corners, eight 
in the first half, that further raised the agony of drawing blank at 
the breather.

In fact, on three separate occasions before half time Japan had a 
chance to move ahead. However, Pakistan defenders checked the Japanese 
movements and things were kept under control.

In the second session, game was being played in quite the same tempo 
with Pakistan still looking for their first goal. Just after the 
resumption, Pakistan introduced Rana Atif in place of centre-forward 
Farooq to try and break the deadlock.

The breakthrough finally came in the 52nd minute when a classical 
layoff from Rana Atif was netted by Imran Yousuf to the jubilation of 
the crowd and more to the satisfaction of the Pakistani bench. Six 
minutes later, Muhammad Usman drove home a sizzling penalty corner 
conversion to double the lead. Pakistan's leading goal-getter fullback 
Ali Raza who found himself under pressure against the Japanese 
shrugged off his lax attitude with a blistering shot onto the board to 
convert the 15th and last penalty corner for Pakistan just four 
minutes before the final whistle.

During the last moments Pakistan was playing with nine men. After 
forceful charges by Imran and Aamir resulted in penalisation for 
yellow cards.

In a postmatch comment, manager Samiullah said that Pakistan had the 
ability and strength to inflict a much bigger defeat on Japan but that 
it was off day for their penalty corner hitter besides Japan played 
tight hockey. The manager also stated that it will be a tough match 
against Holland.

In the second pre-final, the Dutch venture to secure a berth in the 
final took only first 18 minutes, more due to the wrong technique 
applied by the Belgian goalkeeper Stephane Moraux. The Belgians did 
launch the opening attack in the 2nd minute. But the Dutch did not 
waste time in drawing the first blood when Mark de Jong's push sounded 
the board in the 5th minute. Later, the Belgian goalkeeper tried to 
tackle the Dutch strikers on top of the circle. The move against 
spearhead Jiskoot was faulty who had no trouble in beating him to 
ground and striking home from top of the circle in the 14th minute to 
make it 2-0. The match was sealed when the Dutch struck for the third 
time off right wing Egbert Ho in the 18th after Belgian keeper strode 
out to meet the charging forward.

While in the second session the Dutch tried to save energy for the 
final against Pakistan, the Belgian keeper geared up to a better 
performance and foiled many attempts. Holland obtained 13 PCs but only 
converted the first.

The Dutch manager Vettorato viewed the final as tough but he said his 
boys would give their best. "We wanted to play Pakistan in such a 
tournament to find out our real strength and weakness," he said. 

In the positional fixture, a solitary goal by Luca Urli gave Italy the 
vital win over Malaysia. Urli coverted penalty corner in the 46th 
minute to bang home the winner.

In the clash of the underdogs, Mexico overpowered Kenya 2-0 to secure 
ninth position in the tournament. Leading 14 at breather, off a 
penalty stroke conversion by Vazgdez in the 11th minute, Mexico added 
its second goal when Morales converted a penalty corner in the 56th 
minute.

In the other fixture at Wah, South Africa rolled over Russia 5-3 over 
shootout after the game was tied 2-2 in the regulation time. A 3rd 
minute lead by striker Emile Smith was equalised by the Russians four 
minutes before breather.

At resumption the Russians were put ahead by their vibrant striker 
Alexei Mikheev, but SA also took no time to equalise within next three 
minutes.

FIXTURES: Jan 6: SA vs Italy at 9.30, Japan vs Belgium at 1200 Final: 
Pakistan vs Holland at 2:30p.m.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD,  Jan 6: Pakistan disposed of Holland 2-0 to lift the 7up 
World Youth Hockey Festival trophy in front of a jam-packed Army 
Hockey Stadium.

Japan edged past Belgium 9-8 on sudden death shootout. Trailing by two 
goals at the breather they held Belgium 2-2 in regulation time, 
scoring the equalisers in the last seven minutes of the game, to 
clinch third slot in the under-18 world hockey meet that concluded 
after ten days of competition amongst ten teams of the world.
    
The  final clash between Pakistan and Holland was a battle of rivalry 
between the Asian and European game strategies. Pakistan banking its 
hopes on its strikers faced off sturdy and firm defence by the Dutch.
    
For Holland, the  suspension  of  penalty corner striker J.J Vant Land 
proved irreversible as the Dutch scoring plan relying on penalty 
corner conversion flopped in seven attempts. Also, their replacement 
of Van, Olaf Bakker got injured off a corner shot by Pakistani 
striker to bring about a third change which altered the main structure 
of the Dutch squad.

At the outset of the final, Holland initiated the opening attacks, but 
there were no attempts. The hosts launched their offensive from the 
right flank. They succeeded in acquiring  the first penalty corner in 
the fifth minute. However, Ali Razas direct slam was deflected by the 
Dutch keeper Josef Kramer. In a counter move Holland right wing sent 
in a classical cross to the centre of the shooting circle but a full 
stretched dive by left wing striker Olaf Bakker fell short to connect 
the ball. This also sent waves of excitement in the spectators.

Next, although Pakistan maintained its pressure through the 
right flank  winger Rana Atif and spearhead  Farooq  fumbled with 
excellent open net chances. In the 14th minute Farooq after hopping 
onto to a gap pass from Imran Yousuf had world of time to hit a winner 
but his strike landed onto to the keepers pads. The left flank had one 
significant rally in the 18th minute with left half  Waseem, who has 
displayed maturity during the crunch games, tapped in a classical left 
wing pass to Baber Abdullah but the  winger failed to capitalise it. 
Pakistan secured their second penalty corner in the 20th  minute, 
though Ali Razas strike was above the board. Later, Rana Atif sent 
wide a top of the circle attempt after Waseem had stopped Dutch Van 
Ryn within 25 yards. The fumbling prompted manager Samiullah 
to replace an off- colour Rana Atif with winger Zakirullah. The Dutch 
mid- fielders in their attempts to give a clean pass to forward tried 
mostly to scoop the ball but the strategy did not bring forth anything 
worthwhile for them.

In the 25th, Pakistans opening goal might well have come from Farooq 
who was downed by the charging Dutch defender inside the shooting zone 
while he was trying to place the shot. A penalty corner was awarded. 
However Pakistani players tried for a penalty stroke. It was the 
thundering direct slam from full back Ali Raza onto the board that 
made Rawalpindi public dance in jubilation as Pakistan went one up in 
the 26th minute.
    
Three  minutes before breather, the Dutch stepping up efforts to 
equalise, saw a brilliant diving attempt by  David Meuwsen foiled. 
This also secured their first PC, but Ali Razas speedy dash gave no 
time to Dutch striker Maarten Froger and the indirect hit went for a 
corner. Just before the half time whistle, Dutch skipper Friso Jiskoot 
was penalised with yellow card after he had shouted at the referee 
over a call inside Pakistani half.
    
Pakistan resumed the game in much better spirits and with superior 
moves as the green-shirted strikers infiltrated the opponent zone 
without break in the first 15 minutes of the second session. The raids 
also produced an  outstanding diving connection from right wing 
Zakirullah in the 46th minute. Zakirullah striding inward from his own 
position after a fine lay off from Irfan had the ball a little out of 
reach but his diving angular attempt got the keeper Kramer not ready, 
who was still trying to judge his moves. Leading by two goals, the 
charging Pakistani strikers shattered the Dutch defences. 
However, Dutch keeper played steadily to foil the attempts.
    
In the 14th minute, Pakistani skipper Khalid was penalised with a 
yellow card for a wrong charge against a Dutch player. Playing with 10 
players the Dutch found plenty of openings to penetrate the Pakistani 
half as they secured two penalty corners but Pakistani custodian Qasim 
who has remained flawless in his performances, was unbeatable. After 
Pakistan eased the Dutch pressure with some long hitting and two 
excellent moves by Farooq and Khalid, the Dutch launched another 
string of raids, as they earned four penalty corners, but swift dashes 
by Pakistanis gave them no direct attempts especially on the seventh 
and last PC Babar Abdullah took the ball from right under the nose of 
Dutch strikers and embarked on a solo run into the Dutch zone.
    
The manager singled out left half Waseem Ahmed as the player of the 
tournament for Pakistan, stating that the boy has a lot of potential. 
Sami went on to state that with a few changes Pakistan will retain the 
same team for the World Junior Championship.
    
The Holland team manager J. Vettorato said that the two changes in his 
team proved hard against the hosts. However, he said that Pakistan 
deserved to win the event since they had displayed far better 
technique, skill and stamina during the competition.
    
Pakistan: Muhammad Qasim, Ali Raza, Tariq Imran, Irfan Yousuf, 
Muhammad Saqlain, Waseem Ahmed, Zakarullah, Ejaz Imran, Muhammad 
Farooq, Muhammad Khalid (capt), Aamir Mehmood, Iftikhar  Ahmed, 
Muhammad Usman, Imran Yousuf, Rana Atif, Babar Abdullah. 
 
Holland: Olaf Bakker, Marcel Bulder, Lucas Duijndam, Maarten Froger, 
Danny laHaye, Egbert Ho, Michiel de Jager, Friso Jiskoot, Mark  de 
Jong Josef, Jan Jorn, David Meuwsen, Okke Monking.
    
Japan recorded a thrilling 9-8 win decided over shootout in a sudden 
death play against Belgium in the third position play- off after they 
held the opponents to a 2-2 draw in regulation time.
    
This is the second time in a crucial game that the Japanese after 
trailing two down have gone ahead to hold their opponents. Earlier, in 
the vital pool-B fixture against South Africa, two down the Japanese 
forced the tie drawing 2-2 at the end to qualify for the semi-finals.
    
The Belgians struck twice on two consecutive penalty corners in the 
first half to sit pretty in the positional play-off. They opened the 
account early into the game when skipper Renaod Fayt converted the 
first penalty corner in the 6th minute. Later Jean Blune made it 2-0 
by converting the second.
    
Although, Japan dominated better part of the game but their strikers 
failed to score, and it was only in the last seven minutes of the game 
that substitute Akabane rallied home to reduce the margin 2-1 in the 
63 rd minute. Two minutes later, Hitomi Kakumaru converted the 10th PC 
to tie the scores 2-2.
    
In the penalty shootout, the scores remained tied with 3-3, and the 
match could only be decided on a sudden death play at 6-5.
    
Coming to terms with their stricking targets, the Malaysian strikers 
registered 7-3 triumph over Russia in the 7-8 position play - off  at 
Army Stadium. Malaysia was leading 4-1 at the breather.

<a name="muda">Mudassar gets hundred : Pakistans 7-wkts win over India</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Virendra Varma

SHARJAH, Jan 7: There was hardly any dramatic twist to the script of 
India-Pakistan matches at Sharjah.
    
Pakistan invariably reserve their best for India, and today it was the 
turn of their masters to continue what by now has become a familiar 
trend. Their stiff legs suddenly found enough energy and their batsmen 
the touch they were groping for. The transformation, even by their 
reckoning, was a bit surprising.
 
And the man who made it all happen was Mudassar Nazar, carrying his 
bat with a brilliant unbeaten 107, his highest in one-day cricket. In 
official one-day internationals his best being 95 recorded against 
Australia at the same ground in 1986.
    
What actually tilted the scales in the favour of Pakistan, new-comers 
to the tournament, was their ability to convert singles into twos, an 
area which had the Indians huffing and panting. In fact, Pakistan 
built their innings around singles and twos. There were just eight 
boundaries in their total of 216.
    
Mudassar played extremely well and so was Sadiq Mohammed who chipped 
in with a delightful 49 off 68 balls. Sadiq has been playing 
regularly back home averaging over 50, and his fluent knock didnt 
come as a surprise. It was a team effort that saw us through in this 
close match. The target(216) was anyway achievable on this wicket, 
said the captain whose bold decision to opt for fielding surprised 
many.
    
We wanted to take advantage of the heavy outfield in the morning, 
added Zaheer. Indian captain Sunil Gavaskar said: We didnt do 
justice to our abilities. The guys were stiff and it was not easy to 
run between the wickets. I think playing two consecutive matches was a 
bit too much for us.
    
I am not trying to find an excuse for our defeat, but certainly 
playing on two successive days sapped out energies.
    
India made a quiet start to their innings in the face of an accurate 
medium pace attack of Pakistan. Both Bakht and Mudassar bowled a 
maiden each before India opened their account in third over. The loss 
of K. Srikkanth in the fourth over, splendidly caught by Ejaz Fakih at 
backward short leg off Mudassar for just four, killed Indias hopes of 
piling up a big total (If Srikkanth gets going any score is 
possible. as Gavaskar put it).
    
Gavaskar and Mohinder Amarnath quickly got into the groove and went 
about heir task of repairing the damage with a great deal of authority 
and conviction. It was a treat to watch the way the two dominated the 
bowling, but then again they did not have enough steam for quick 
threes or twos.
    
When Gavaskar left, caught by Tasleem Arif off Iqbal Qasim, India were 
in a comfortable position of two for 2100 off 23.3 overs. During his 
flawless know of 43 off 78 balls, Gavaskar hit two glorious fours. 
Mohinder completed his second successive 50 in the company of Dilip 
Vengsarkar (28 off 31 balls with one four). The two looked in good 
command and were stroking freely before a tired (62 off 82 balls with 
four fours). Rana himself out to a direct under-arm throw from Majid 
Khan.
    
Sandeep Patil did try to open up, hitting 12 off 14 balls before 
snicking straight into the hands of wicketkeeper Tasleem Arif, who did 
a great job behind the stumps despite being out of touch with the 
gloves for years.
    
It were Madan Lal (33 off 29 balls) and Syed Kirmani (27 off 24 balls) 
who raised the momentum of the game with lusty hitting and added 63 
runs off the last 58 balls. Their scintillating stroke-play put so 
much pressure on Pakistani fielders that they dropped as many as four 
simple catches  one each by Iqbal Qasim, substitute Aftab Baloch, 
Salim Yousuf and Zaheer Abbas  in the last two overs. But slippery 
fingers did help India to take the score 47 runs in the last five 
overs.
    
Pakistan were off to a dream start with their openers Sadiq and 
Mudassar negotiating the well-balanced Indian attack with authority. 
The 51-year-old Sadiq initially was the most aggressive of the two and 
the way he chipped, pulled and on-drove had many marvelling at his 
ability to retain part of a once-amazing wristy touch.
    
With Nazar digging deep into his experience, the two paced their 
innings according to plan: kept the score ticking. It was simply 
unbelievable to see the way the two, Sadiq in particular, converting 
singles into twoes. Where they got all that energy from was a mystery?
    
When Sadiq left  to a standing ovation from the crowd and players  
he had already made sure of a Pakistan victory. The opening pair made 
113 off 26.1 overs. Zaheer promoted himself up in the order but his 
intentions of finishing the match met a premature, rather freak, end. 
A straight drive from Mudassar crashed against the stumps at the non-
strikers end, catching Zaheer off the crease. Zaheer made 14 off 17 
balls.
    
With Mudassar hardly showing any signs of fatigue, the only interest 
left in the game was how and when the winning run would come. Salim 
Yousuf (19 off 22) was shaping well before running himself out. In 
fact, all the three Pakistan batsmen were run-out victims.
    
After his exit, it was left to Majid Khan (12 off 17 balls)) to help 
Mudassar complete the formalities which he duly did in the 44th over.
    
I was determined to carry the bat through and I am pleased things 
worked out to my liking. Its my first century in one-day cricket. 
Though it came late, still I am pretty excited about, said Mudassar 
who scored 107 off 140 balls with five fours.
