<a name="pesh">Peshawar blast: FIR registered 5 months prior to tragedy</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Abdul Sami Paracha

PESHAWAR, Jan 22: Reports compiled by leading sensitive state agencies 
on the tackling of Peshawar bomb blasts investigation by the NWFP law 
enforcement agencies have termed all the arrests made in this 
connection as a face saving measure and far from the hard realities 
of the case.

Highly placed sources in different agencies confided to Dawn that 
hundreds of Afghan suspects rounded up from various areas of the 
province were charged under a general FIR dated 03-07-1995 which had 
been registered as a precautionary measure to be used against 
unidentified terrorists in case of any untoward incident and whenever 
necessary.
    
It was done to avoid future embarrassment as the intelligence agencies 
had already conveyed an important message about the serious mishap in 
the wake of minor explosions and the entry of foreign terrorists in 
the country much before the Peshawar bomb blast in the Cantonment area 
in December last.
    
There are confirmed reports that some of the senior police officials 
in the NWFP police have expressed their reservations to carry out the 
directives of their IGP regarding the investigation procedures of the 
case during high-level meetings.
    
Commenting on Gen Ghaffars arrest, sources said there were many 
instances where the police had released blast suspects without proper 
investigation. They said such blunders being committed at high level 
have made the investigation very suspicious which now needs to be 
handed over to some other agency which could do it independently.

<a name="bhan">Bhandara apprehends arrest, alleges persecution</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 22: M.P. Bhandara, chief executive of the 135-year-old 
Murree Brewery, has expressed the fear of his imminent arrest "as the 
logical consequence of my crime of hurting the business interests of 
the most powerful and important person of Pakistan".

Talking to Dawn by telephone, he alleged that he was being 
"relentlessly persecuted" by the authorities and cited the "totally 
illegal" closure of the brewery on Jan 17 as the "latest proof" in 
this regard. He plans to take out a public, appeal in the national 
press extolling the president to intervene in the name of justice", as 
he put it.

Talking of his fears of an imminent arrest, he claimed that he had 
already received information that FIR's were being drafted to 
implicate in one case or another and now he believed "a case may just 
have been found." He said recently , someone had erected a wall within 
the premises of the brewery along the railway track leading into the . 
brewery, claiming that he had been , allotted the plot in 1993 by an 
MNA who happened to be a member of House committee on railway.

The wall was pulled down by, brewery employees on Sunday and the man 
lodged a complaint with the authorities. Mr Bhandara said his managers 
had been summoned by a magistrate on Tuesday. "They'll definitely be 
arrested and probably then it would be my turn to be implicated in the 
case," he added.

Mr Bhandara's fears came to the fore when he was contacted to confirm 
the contents of a letter supposedly sent to President Leghari, and a 
copy of which was faxed to Dawn. He said the fax comprised the 
original and a lengthy draft which had, therefore, not been sent to 
the president Instead, he said, he would be taking out a public appeal 
and read out the contents on phone since, he claimed, his fax which 
was sealed along with the brewery, had yet to be restored.

According to the original draft, Mr Bhandara has alleged persecution 
at the hands of a "high and mighty personality interested in the 
setting up of a brewery distillery in Sindh." He claimed that he had 
no objection to the setting up of new breweries but that all he 
desired was a "level playing field and, in particular, the permission 
to export our huge unutilised plant-capacity and receive non-
discriminatory treatment in sales to Sindh."

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 19: The Pakistan Railways has been permitted to go ahead 
with the privatisation process of its non-remunerative sections.
    
Accordingly, the railways has completed the exercise of pre- 
qualifying the interested firms for taking up the contracts of sale 
and checking of tickets on the proposed sections.
    
The railways proposes to give out on contracts Hyderabad- Mir-Purkhas; 
Hyderabad-Badin; Lahore-Narowal; Quetta-Taftan; Taxila-Havelian; and 
Nowshera-Dargai sections. Sources disclosed that presently the railway 
headquarters was processing some offers for sale and checking of 
tickets on the Lahore-Narowal section.
   
The railways has fixed a bench-mark of Rs 30.25 million for the 
bidders, including the escalation factor.

<a name="legh">Leghari seeks briefing on privatisation </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Jan 20: President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari has invited the 
Privatisation Commission (PC) to brief him in detail about its 
privatisation programme during the course of the year.
    
The PC has firmed up plans to privatise during 1996, Pakistan 
Telecommunication Corporation, Sui Southern Gas Company, Kot Ado Power 
Station, United Bank Limited, Bankers Equity Limited, and Habib Bank 
Limited.
    
In the backdrop of the ongoing media controversy over the pros and 
cons of selling UBL to a foreign party and the opposition PMLs total 
rejection of the idea, the sudden interest of the President in the 
affairs of the PC is being considered highly significant.

<a name="egha">Leghari briefed on privatisation : Naveed</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Jan 24: President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari was given a 
comprehensive presentation on the on-going privatisation process by 
Chairman Syed Naveed Qamar and Secretary Abdullah Yousuf of the 
Privatisation Commission.
    
Denying reports that the President was concerned over the 
privatisation of United Bank Limited (UBL) and Pakistan 
Telecommunication Corporation (PTC) and had called for the 
postponement of sale of these units, he said the President had not 
asked for the briefing rather it was held on the request of the 
commission.
    
Sources, claiming to be well informed, said that the President had 
wanted the Privatisation Commission to explain to him some of the 
points raised by a Lahore weekly with regard to the extent of 
transparency in the privatisation process.
    
Regarding the privatisation of PTC and UBL, he said it would be held 
as planned. The road shows of the PTC had already been completed and 
soon the potential buyers would visit Pakistan to assess the price of 
the corporation recently converted into a private limited company, he 
added.
    
Responding to a question whether the Faysal Bank of Bahrain, which 
earlier had qualified for the final bidding of UBL, had withdrawn, he 
said they had asked the government to deposit Rs 20 billion with the 
bank for a period of five years after its privatisation or make 
specific commitment for financial support.
    
The Faysal Bank had indicated that they might withdraw if their 
demands were not met, he added. These demands were not acceptable and 
we assume that they have withdrawn them, he said.

<a name="stro">Strong govt required to check HR abuses: Asma</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report  

PESHAWAR, Jan 20: Ms Asma Jehangir, chairperson of the Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has said that all Pakistan lacked was a 
strong government will to check institutionalised human rights abuses 
committed by politicians, judges of the respectable courts, 
businessmen, landlords and influentials.
    
She said her organisation cannot set priorities as far as human rights 
violations are concerned, in a society where the government as well 
the various communities are not used to the norms and principles of 
democracy.
    
Regretting the state of political and social affairs in the country 
she informed the participants that the HRCP has recommended to the 
government that superior court judges should be appointed with the 
joint consent of the Prime Minister, the leader of the opposition and 
chief justice of Pakistan, to ensure the effective working of the 
judiciary in the country.
    
To a query she said that politicians are public property and the Press 
has the right to expose their wrong doings in the interest of the 
public. She suggested that if even if judges are corrupt let the Press 
report such matters for the greater national interest. She asked 
politicians to refrain from filing defamation suits against the Press 
and instead face the charges framed against them.
    
Ms Asma said that excesses in society by the police have reached an 
alarming stage and people were being killed at the behest of the 
government and influential people in fake encounters.
    
A report about such accounts, especially in Karachi, has been prepared 
and submitted to the government. She was of the view that the police 
cannot be tamed unless it was humanised and other major changes were 
made in its set-up and structure.
    
She elaborated that the investigative section should be separated from 
the law and order section and ministers and other dignitaries should 
employ their own security guards and not horrify the people by using 
officials protocols.
    
To another query she said that the HRCP cannot afford to expand its 
charter to the whole world owing to a shortage of resources and 
manpower. However the Commission formally condemns the human rights 
abuses committed worldwide, she added.

<a name="hrcp">HRCP seeks probe into extra-judicial killings, torture</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 22: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan called upon 
the government to constitute a commission headed by a judge of the 
Supreme Court to thoroughly investigate allegations of custodial 
torture and deaths and extra-judicial killings.
    
In a joint statement issued on Monday, Justice Dorab Patel, chairman 
emeritus, and Asma Jehangir, chairperson of the Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan, said they were deeply disturbed by the 
increasing number of deaths in custody or in encounters with the law 
enforcement agencies in Sindh and particularly in Karachi, as well as 
the large number of mutilated bodies found stuffed in sacks.
    
We are also deeply disturbed by the practice of picking up large 
numbers of people without any cases having been registered against 
them, and their implication in blind FIRs later on.
    
The absence of any proper inquiry into these incidents is undermining 
law and order. We are also disturbed by allegations of custodial 
torture and deaths, they said. Justice Dorab Patel and Asma Jehangir 
demanded that commission should take punitive action against all those 
found guilty of resorting to extra-legal actions.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 21: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah said there 
was definite proof of India and Afghanistans involvement in terrorism 
in Karachi.
    
The Sindh Chief Minister said Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani had 
openly supported MQMs terrorist wing and offered Altaf Hussain to set 
up his offices in Kabul. He accused Kabul and New Delhi of arming 
terrorists in Pakistan and funding MQM chief Altaf Hussain in London.
    
Abdullah Shah said India was trying to destabilise Pakistan to avenge 
Muslim uprising in occupied Kashmir while Rabbani was hand in gloves 
with the Indian government.
    
Abdullah Shah said he had concrete evidence of Kabul and New Delhis 
involvement in incidents of terrorism in Karachi. He said now 
terrorism was being spread to other parts of the country to create 
chaos and unrest.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

GENEVA, Jan 23: Pakistan said that it expected categorical 
assurances that India will not carry out another nuclear test, 
warning failure to provide the guarantees would jeopardise conclusion 
of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) in the near future.
    
We look forward to categorical assurances that such a test is not 
being contemplated and will not be conducted, Pakistani ambassador 
Munir Akram told a UN conference on disarmament.
    
He warned that a test would certainly subvert the possibility of 
concluding the CTBT in the near future and added that his country 
would take appropriate measures if nuclear-capable missiles were 
deployed along its borders.

<a name="cons">Constable among 22 killed in city violence</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 18: Twenty-two people, including a police constable , 
Rehan Ahmed, one of the most wanted MQM activists, his younger brother 
and three other party workers were killed in sporadic incidents of 
violence in the city raising the months death toll to 92.


Rehan Ahmed, who was carrying a head money of Rs 1.5 million and was 
wanted in over 100 murder cases, died along with his younger brother 
Junaid Ahmed, his cousin Tanveer Pasha, Shaikh Zaki, and Nayab Haider.
    
Rehans family disputed the police version and claimed that all the 
five had been arrested during a raid on the residence of Rehans 
mother-in-law in the Federal B Area.

In another incident following a shoot-out, Alam Zeb, said to be an MQM 
(H) activist was killed. Parveen Fatima, and a constable Mohammad Ali

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 24: MQM chief Altaf Hussain has asked all his party 
office-bearers and activists to go underground to avoid what he 
described government suppression.
    
In a Press statement issued and copy of which was faxed to Dawn from 
London, Mr Hussain urged all his workers to immediately go into hiding 
as according to him Benazir Bhutto and her government have decided to 
eliminate all Mohajirs.
    
The life of each companion is dear to me and therefore, I ask 
everyone of them to immediately go underground otherwise the savage 
government will arrest and kill them in fake encounters, he said.
    
Reacting over the arrest of his Lyari acting chief Mohammad Yaseen and 
five other office-bearers in Karachi, Mr Hussain said that after their 
arrests no one would believe in government statements that the MQM 
should take part in politics and begin its political activities in the 
city. These statements, according to him, were being given to misguide 
the democratic forces.
    
Mr Hussain said he had sent telegrams to international human rights 
organisation to save the lives of Mohammad Yaseen, acting chief Lyari 
sector, Mohammad Zakir, Musharaf Ali, Mehmood and Nasir Ajmeri.

KARACHI, Jan 18: One of the three MQM men who had ambushed and killed 
a Pakistani employee of the US Drug Enforcement Agency in North 
Nazimabad in August was arrested.
    
The young suspect was identified as Ziaullah, he was arrested by 
police on Jan 16 on the suspicion of his being involved in rocket 
attacks but during interrogation he also told police that he was a 
member of the three-men MQM team which killed Maj Shah Nawaz Toor.
    
The motive behind killing the DEA employee, he said, was to shut down 
the US Consulate in the city so that America could force the Pakistan 
government to accept MQM demands. It was aimed to shut down other 
consulates so that information about whatever happened in the city did 
not reach the outside world, he said.
    
Asked when the motive was to put pressure on America, why then the 
Americans themselves were not killed and why a Pakistani employee was 
targeted, Ziaullah said that for them he (Toor) was the most important 
person.

<a name="dehl">Dehlavi asks govt to honour its commitments</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, Jan 23: MQM chief negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi said that the 
government must stop torture and extra-judicial killings and honour 
its commitments if restoration of peace through negotiations was its 
objective.
    
There will be no delay on our part to come to the negotiating table 
if the above was done by the government, said Mr Dehlavi.
    
Mr Dehlavis remarks indicated that resumption of the stalled talks 
was still a far cry as there seem to be no change in the positions 
taken by the two parties.
    
Commenting on the federal cabinets decision about its handling of the 
Karachi situation, Mr Dehlavi said : It appears that they are 
inclined more towards the use of brute force and have forgotten that 
the people, whom the PPP also regards as the bastion of power, cannot 
be tamed by the use of force.
    
Any solution dictated by the use of force could not be lasting and 
acceptable to the people, he said. Mr Dehlavi said not only the MQM 
but also the human rights organisations had also taken exception to 
the extra-judicial and custodial killings and torture of MQM 
activists. In this context, he mentioned the observation, made by the 
HRCP in which it had called for constituting a commission headed by a 
judge of the Supreme Court to investigate the allegations about 
custodial torture and deaths and extra-judicial killings.

<a name="oppo">Opposition senators stage walkout</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 21: The opposition in Senate staged a token boycott of 
proceedings as a show of solidarity with their MQM colleagues. The 
walkout had been led by MQM senators Ishtiaq Azhar and Aftab Sheikh 
who accused the government of indulging in extra- judicial killings 
of MQM workers and supporters. 
  
Speaking on a point of order before the walkout, Sen Azhar warned the 
government that if the situation persisted like this then a time may 
come when the people would refuse to listen to us and even to Altaf 
Hussain.
  
He alleged that 31 police mobiles and three APCs had cordoned off an 
entire locality on Saturday and staged a fake encounter which 
resulted in the killing of MQM workers. He was making a reference to 
the killings of alleged terrorist Rehan Kana and his accomplices in an 
encounter with law enforcing agencies. 
 
He went on to point out that one of the dead had a head money of one 
million rupees, insinuating that the police might have killed him to 
collect the reward. The two senators then staged a boycott, followed 
by the entire opposition. 

The minister of state for law, Raza Rabbani, denied the charge and 
claimed that the hideout of the criminals had been raided on a tip-off 
but when the terrorists opened fire on the police with automatic 
weapons and rocket launchers, the police returned the fire and killed 
the terrorists. 

To substantiate his claim of a genuine encounter, he pointed out 
that two policemen had also been seriously injured.

<a name="toke">Token walkout staged by opposition senators</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Jan 22: Entire opposition in the Senate staged a walkout 
when Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar expressed his inability to 
interfere in the provincial affairs after Senator Ajmal Khattak 
pointed out that he and some other legislators were refused permission 
to meet Sheikh Rashid, MNA, and opposition leader in the Punjab 
Assembly Shahbaz Sharif.

The country, the senator remarked, was facing serious crisis where 
peoples rights, constitution and democratic norms were being trampled 
upon but the rulers were shutting their eyes and doing nothing.

Mr Khattak, who was also supported by opposition leader in the Senate 
Raja Zafarul Haq, Chaudhry Mohammad Anwar Bhindar and Tariq Chaudhry, 
said the interior ministers open admission that he was unable to do 
anything meant that there was no cohesion between the federal and 
provincial governments.
    
He said no action was taken against a Peoples Party MNA from whom a 
revolver was recovered but Sheikh Rashid, who is a senior political 
leader, was sentenced on a false charge. Similarly, he added, 
Shahbaz Sharif was a senior politician and except for his relations 
nobody else, even members of the parliament, were allowed to meet him.
    
Senator Bhinder of the PML pointed out that the interior minister had 
earlier stated on the floor of the House that government would try to 
sort out the matter and ensure that meetings with the detained leaders 
by the people, particularly members of the House, would be allowed 
freely.
    
Mr Babar, however, reiterated his inability to do anything in this 
connection, leading to a token walkout from the House.
    
But, the Minister for Water and Power, Ghulam Mustafa Khar, assured 
the House that the matter would be taken up with the provincial 
government to ensure that meetings were allowed.

<a name="acer">Acerbic exchanges dominate NA proceedings</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Muhammad Malick   

ISLAMABAD, Jan 23: Bellicose rhetoric and fiery speeches loaded with 
innuendoes, dominated the proceedings of the National Assembly session 
requisitioned by the opposition.
    
With the alleged attack on Nawaz Sharifs life being on the agenda, 
the sitting had been expected to prove an explosive affair but it was 
perhaps the rare presence of both the prime minister and leader of the 
opposition in the House which seemed to have super-charged the hawks 
on both sides of the aisle.
    
At the outset, ANPs Asfandyar Wali moved an adjournment motion to 
discuss the issue and accordingly the speaker set aside a two-hour 
chunk for the purpose. Later, however, the whole day was consumed by 
the debate, which will continue on Wednesday as well.
    
The first salvo was fired by deputy opposition leader Gohar Ayub Khan 
who, accused the government of virtually every crime under the sun.
    
The former speakers discourse swayed from one issue to another but 
somehow the only thing he did not touch upon was the actual incident 
of the attack in Hala. And that was all the opening an astute lawyer 
like Raza Rabbani required.
    
The minister of state for law immediately launched a fierce frontal 
attack on Gohar Ayub, equating his arguments to being the angry 
rumblings of a disappointed man. He pointed out that Gohar Ayub had 
not made a single reference to the Hala incident and had only tried to 
create the impression of Pakistan being a country divided into 
mohallas and zones and divided on linguistic and ethnic lines. 
Dismissing the opposition claims rather disdainfully, he thundered: 
The whole assassination attempt charge is just a drama to seek public 
sympathy.
    
Makhdoom Amin Fahim undoubtedly proved the most distinguished of the 
entire battery of speakers. Speaking in a composed manner, he said he 
would have condemned such an attack on anyone let alone the leader of 
the opposition. Informing the House that he had been told about the 
incident while he was in Karachi and had condemned it immediately. He 
said he was ready to go to his village and conduct a personal and 
totally impartial inquiry into the facts of the event and apprise the 
House accordingly.

<a name="trea">Treasury benches face embarrassment</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD, Jan 24: The treasury faced some very embarrassing when 
first, the deputy speaker refuted the governments defence of imposing 
a total ban on visitors of jailed parliamentarians and then the 
speaker, too, brushing aside the law ministers arguments, referred 
the matter to the House privileges committee.

It all started with a privilege motion moved by opposition MNAs 
agitating against the government ban on meeting their jailed 
colleague, Sheikh Rashid. The minister of State for Law, Raza Rabbani, 
immediately challenged the motion on the ground that every criminal 
was equal in the eyes of law and that a convicted parliamentarian did 
not enjoy any special status as compared to an ordinary convict.

After listening to the detailed deliberations of Syed Iftikhar Gillani 
and a sharp crisp interlude by Syed Zafar Ali Shah, the speaker 
concurring to their views ruled that a jailed MNA did have special 
privileges and declaring the motion in order referred it to the 
committee. All a hapless looking Mr Rabbani could do was shake his 
head in disbelief.
    
That the opposition would make a strong case of its grievance was 
expected but the governments defence received a serious and totally 
unexpected setback when the deputy speaker, Zafar Ali Shah, rising 
languidly from his seat, tore down Rabbanis line of argument. He said 
an elected representative did enjoy a special status because he was 
not an ordinary person to begin with. The deputy speaker, known for 
taking the privileges of parliamentarians very seriously, went on to 
reason that a parliamentarian represented hundreds of thousands of 
people and helped resolve their problems.
    
If Zafar Ali Shahs arguments had posed a dilemma for Mr Rabbani, 
Iftikhar Gillanis suave legal interpretation of the privilege only 
added to his growing frustration.
    
Citing Article 66 of the Constitution, Mr Gillani argued that the ban 
constituted a denial of the fundamental privileges guaranteed by the 
Constitution. His reasoning being that where the law was silent, the 
privilege of the member was inviolable. He seemed to be referring to 
clause (2) of the Article which reads: In other respects, the powers, 
immunities and privileges of Majlis-i-Shoora (parliament), shall be 
such as may from time to time be defined by law and, until so defined, 
shall be such as were, immediately before the commencing day, enjoyed 
by the National Assembly of Pakistan and the committees thereof and 
its members.
    
He opined that the government was free to regulate the jailed MNAs 
visits but it could not bar him from interacting with his constituents 
as long as he was a sitting member of the House.
    
Speaking about the alleged attack on Mian Nawaz Sharif, he criticised 
the government for needlessly blowing up the issue whereas all it had 
to do was express its concern and order an inquiry. Even now I hope 
the president and the prime minister will call the leader of the 
opposition and not only register their concern but also order 
inquiries into such a sensitive matter.
    
Mr Gillani had a point to make when he lamented that if a soldier or a 
civil servant was attacked it was considered a serious attack on the 
institution itself, adding pointedly Doesnt the leader of the 
opposition represent the institution of parliament, the most sacred of 
all the institutions.
    
Imploring the government to foster new healthy traditions, he warned 
that unless this happened, democracy would remain under a serious 
threat.
    
The Sheikh Rashid affair proved the only real source of friction for 
the day because an intelligent manipulation of the days agenda 
ensured that the overwhelming part of the remaining sitting was taken 
up in legislation. The government managed to lay another six 
presidential ordinances and introduce three bills in the House.
    
It was, therefore, only at the fag-end of the sitting that the House 
could take up debating the law and order situation, a pseudonym for 
discussing the Hala incident. Oppositions Makhdoom Javed Hashmi took 
up the cudgels for the day but thanks to his over emotional and 
college campus style debate, he soon lost the attention of the House.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="imft">IMF tightens control over Pakistan economy</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Jan 23: Details of the terms and conditions of the 15-month 
standby loan arrangement worth 600 million dollars between Islamabad 
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), signed last month, show an 
all-pervasive role for the IMF in Pakistans economic policy making 
and financial management, according to documents made available to 
Dawn.
    
Proposing strict performance criteria, including fixing of floors and 
ceilings on variables, the fund has given its own unilateral 
definitions of reserve money, net foreign and domestic assets of the 
State Bank, domestic liquidity, net foreign and domestic assets of the 
banking system, budgetary support, overall budget deficit, net 
external financing, net domestic non-bank financing, CBR revenue and 
public and publicly-guaranteed external debt, leaving no helpful 
ambiguity for the government to fudge the data to its advantage.
    
The reporting requirements of the standby arrangement are very 
stringent and call for supply of data to the Middle Eastern department 
of the fund through the office of the resident representative 
according to the following schedule:

 Monthly statement on CBR tax collection and surcharges;

 Privatisation proceeds from abroad for 1994-95 and for each quarter 
of 1995-96;

 Deposits into, and withdrawals from, the privatisation accounts for 
each quarter of 1994-95 and 1995-96 (with regard to withdrawals, the 
supplier of data is required to specify a) those which constitute 
budgetary use of privatisation proceeds; b)those which constitute 
costs of privatisation; and c) Others with full particulars about the 
purpose;

 Quarterly statement showing capital receipts and disbursements 
including repayments of bonds, recovery of loans from provinces and 
others;

 Quarterly data on external financing, including project aid, 
commodity aid, food aid, and other non-project financing (including 
suppliers credit);

 The following monthly monetary data on a last Thursday basis, both 
at current and programme exchange rates, beginning in June 1995: a) 
monetary survey, b) accounts of the State Bank, c) consolidation 
accounts of the scheduled banks, and d) net credit to government;

 The same tables in item 6, but on an end-quarter basis (including 
the data for end-June, 1995), both at current and programme exchange 
rates;

 The following quarterly data on external debt for 1994-95 and 1995-
96: a) stock of public and publicly-guaranteed external debt 
(including deferred payments arrangement), with initial maturities of 
up to and including one year; and b) loan-by-loan detail of the 
contraction of new medium and long term non-concessional public and 
publicly-guaranteed external debt with separate identification of the 
contraction of debt with an initial maturity of over one year and up 
to and including five years.

The IMF has also put a strict ceiling on public and publicly- 
guaranteed short-term foreign debt, amounting to 1.05 billion dollars 
for the quarter ending March, 1996, down from 1.1 billion dollars 
fixed for the period ending December, 1995. But for the three months 
ending June, 1996 the ceiling has been reduced to one billion dollars 
which remains unchanged for the two subsequent quarters.
    
The country has been further restricted from contracting non-
concessional medium- and long-term public and publicly-guaranteed  
external debt with a ceiling of 2.35 billion dollars fixed for the 
period ending December 1995. This includes 350 million dollars with an 
initial maturity of over one year and up to five years but excludes 
public and publicly-guaranteed loans in the energy sector.
    
In the subsequent two quarters, ceilings for debt contracting have 
been fixed at 2.65 billion dollars and 2.95 billion dollars 
respectively, but for the quarter ending September 1996 this ceiling 
has been drastically curtailed to 600 million dollars, improving, 
however, to 900 million dollars for the quarter ending December, 1996.
    
These amounts include 450 million dollars of debt with initial 
maturity of over one year and up to five years for the period ending 
March 1996, 600 million dollars for the quarter ending June 1996, 350 
million dollars for September 1996 and 400 million dollars for 
December 1996.
    
The ceilings cover the entire non-concessional borrowing, including 
loans from multilateral donors and consortium members. Loans with a 
maturity of more than 12 years will also be counted against the 
ceilings. Loans will be counted against the ceilings on contraction 
rather than disbursement basis.
    
The definition of concessional lending has been modified to the effect 
that loans with a grant elements of 35 per cent with currency 
reference rate (CRR) rather than a normal 10 per cent will be deemed 
as concessional. Quarterly ceilings are cumulative flows.
    
All financial instruments or arrangements, like currency swaps, 
leasing etc, will be counted against the ceilings. The public and 
publicly-guaranteed external debt covers all external debt incurred or 
guaranteed by the federal government. It excludes: a) the foreign 
currency deposit liabilities of the banking system; and b) the 
outstanding stocks of FEBCs, DBCs, and FCBCs. The short-term external 
debt includes loans with original maturity of up to and including one 
year while medium- and long-term debt consists of debt with initial 
maturity of over one year.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 22: A former federal minister claims that the criticism 
of a recent deal between Pakistan Petroleum (PPL) and the Hashoo group 
is totally uncalled for and amounts to discouraging foreign 
investment. 
    
Sardar Wazir Ahmed Jogezai, said the shares purchased by Hashoo group 
had previously been held by Burma Castrol. Nobody had any objection 
when these shares were held by a foreign company, he remarked.

He said instead of being happy that a Pakistani has purchased the 
shares, people had started raising frivolous objections.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Saleem Shahid

QUETTA, Jan 24: The Balochistan Assembly opposed the move to hand over 
shares of the Pakistan Petroleum (PPL) to the Hashoo group through its 
privatisation, without taking the assembly into confidence.

A resolution in this regard was moved in the House by Balochistan 
Finance Minister Jaffar Khan Mandokhel, deputy opposition leader 
Maulana Abdul Bari and Mir Zahoor Hussain Khan Khosa of JWP. It was 
adopted unanimously.
    
Maulana Bari of the JUI criticised federal governments decision 
regarding privatisation of the PPL and described it a conspiracy 
against the economy of Balochistan.
 
Under the constitution, the federal government cannot take any 
decision about the natural resources of a province without taking that 
province into confidence, he said, adding that the Economic 
Coordination Council (ECC) made this move without consulting the 
Balochistan government or its assembly.
    
It was a serious violation of the provincial autonomy and the people 
of this province would not allow anybody to take a decision which 
imperilled its economic system and sources of income, he warned.
    
Finance Minister, Mandokel (of PML), taking part in the discussion on 
the resolution, said it was a great injustice to Balochistan that the 
ECC did not even inform the provincial government about its plan to 
hand over the shares of the PPL to Hashoo group.
    
He claimed that over 2000 people were recruited in the PPL on 
political basis by the government during the last two years which 
increased the expenditures of the gas companies.
    
On the basis of this increase in the expenditure, he said, the share 
of Balochistan in the development surcharge on gas was reduced. Our 
50 per cent revenue depend on this surcharge and if it is reduced the 
Balochistan economy would completely collapse, the finance minister 
warned.

is offered, otherwise fresh bids will be invited, the minister said.
    
Earlier former finance minister Senator Sartaj Aziz demanded of the 
government to postpone the privatisation of the bank, till it 
recovered from the present illness.

<a name="mode">Modest recovery despite inconsistency in trading patterns</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Aslam

Stocks prices recovered modestly during the preceding week but buying 
lacked the aggressiveness associated with a bull market.
    
The Karachi Stock 100-share index, after hitting the 1,500 points mark 
fell to close around 1492.10. The KSE all share index also rose 
fractionally. It was last quoted around 834.90.
    
The market capitalisation also rose by about Rs. 2 billion around 320 
billion as compared to Rs. 328.351 billion a week, thanks to better 
performance put in by the blue chips.
    
There was, however, inconsistency in the trading pattern as some bad 
external news did not allow investors to plan for the long-term and 
they just changed positions depending on the background development.
    
Dividend news, mostly from the modaraba companies were disappointing.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices posted fresh gain of 
2.46 points at 1,491.02 as compared to 1,488.56 a day earlier, 
reflecting the strength of base shares.
    
The process of recovery is expected to be initiated in a big way by 
the investment shares under the lead of low-priced issues bank shares. 
Most of them are already rising modestly, major gainers among them 
being Al-Faysal Bank, Asset Bank, JOV, Bank of Punjab, BSJS, Bank Al-
Habib, Faysal and Metropolitan Ban.
    
ICP mutual funds ruled firm as most of them ended with fresh gains but 
modarabas and leasing shares ruled on both sides of the fence followed 
by news of blank years.
    
Insurance shares rose under the lead of leading among the including 
Dadabhoy, Alico, and some others but others fell fractionally.
    
Bulk of the support in synthetic shares remained centred around Dhan 
Fibre, and Ibrahim Fibre, which were traded modestly. Dewan Salman, 
which is being quoted spot after initial fall managed to finish with a 
good gain.
    
Textiles shares were fractionally traded at the falling prices, but 
leading among them including Dewan Textiles, and Shafiq Textiles 
suffered fresh sharp decline.
    
Lucky Cement in the cement sector was actively traded in each session 
on strong speculative buying but others stayed mixed.
    
Energy shares generally rose. But bulk of the support remained centred 
around Hub-Power and the newly turned active, Sitara Energy.
    
Auto shares were traded on both ways but Atlas Honda Cars managed to 
look up on higher sale projections after the introduction of new 
brands.
    
PTC vouchers in the transport sector maintained its firm posture and 
stood firm above Rs. 30 amid heavy volume in each session, totalling 
well over 5 million shares.
    
Most of the MNCs in the chemical and pharma sector maintained their 
recovery trend and ended higher under the lead of BOC, Engro 
Chemicals, ICI Pakistan, Welcome Pakistan, and some others.
    
But by and large Hub-Power, PTC vouchers, ICI Pakistan, Lucky Cement, 
Faysal Bank and Sitara Energy were massively traded in each session, 
according for more than 90 percent of the total volume.
    
Trading volume soared to over 100 million shares from the last weeks 
87 million shares as most of the current favourites were massively 
traded under the lead of Hub-Power and PTC vouchers, although both 
ways as after initial rise they ran into profit-selling.
    
But in the meanwhile, some more shares joined the rank of active under 
the lad of Fauji Fertiliser, ICI Pakistan, and Sitara Energy, which 
were also actively traded mostly on the higher side owing to some 
positive background news about earnings.
    
Reports of higher earning also triggered heavy buying in some of the 
insurance shares under the lead of EFU and Metro Life Insurance which 
were traded higher on large volumes.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Lucky Cement, Faysal Bank, 
Honda Atlas Cars, Schon Bank, Picic LTV Modaraba, Ibrahim Fibre, Dhan 
Fibre, Bank of Punjab, and Indus Fruits.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 23: The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100-share soared 
by another 15.16 points at 1,526.12, consolidating its position well 
above the psychological barrier of 1,500 points.
    
Plus signs dominated the list, with some of the leading shares in the 
forefront of gainers. Adamjee Insurance, for instance, came in for 
renewed strong support and added the overnight gain of Rs 5, another 
Rs 3.50.
    
ICP mutual funds consolidated the overnight gains and so did most of 
the other investment shares, notably the bank ones, which rose further 
but by fractions.
    
Insurance shares, however, rose further under the lead of Adamjee and 
followed by Century, EFU and Dadabhoy Insurance, which posted gains 
ranging from one rupee to 5.
    
Other good gainers were led by MNCs, notably Pakistan Gum, Reckitt and 
Colman, Fauji Fertiliser, ICI Pakistan, and PSO, rising by one rupee 
to Rs 3.
    
Some of the MNCs, however, remained under pressure and were quoted 
lower by one rupee to Rs 1.75, notable losers among them being 
Gillette Pakistan, BOC Pakistan, Pakistan Refinery, Wyeth Lab and 
Dawood Hercules.

Other prominent losers were led by Al-Abid Silk, Fateh Industries, and 
Bawany Sugar, falling by one rupee to Rs 2.
    
Hub-Power topped the list of most actives, up 70 paisa on 4.517 shares 
followed by PTC vouchers, firm 15 paisa on 4.095 million shares, Lucky 
Cement, off one rupee on 1.594 million shares, Faysal Bank, steady 15 
paisa on 632,000 shares, Fauji fertiliser, up Rs 2.40 on 694,700 
shares, ICI Pakistan, up 35 paisa on 567,700 shares, Sitara Energy, 
higher 85 paisa on 420,000 shares and LTV Modaraba, lower five paisa 
on 286,000 shares.
    
Other actives were led by Askari Bank, which fell 25 paisa, followed 
by Dhan Fibre, up 20 paisa on 166,500 shares, Genertech Pakistan, up 
75 paisa on 194,000 shares, and Tri-Pack Films, lower 25 paisa on 
115,000 shares.
    
Trading volume soared to 23.143 million shares thanks to heavy 
business of 2.100 million shares in Hub-Power and a million shares in 
PTC shares.
    
There were 300 actives, out of which 128 shares rose, while 104 fell, 
with 68 holding on to the last levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 24: Stocks rose across a broad on heavy foreign buying, 
lifting the KSE 100-share index by another about 37 points.
    
The markets firm stance and uppish leaning is also evident in a big 
fresh increase of 36.56 points in the KSE 100-share index at 1,562.68 
as compared to 1,5626.12 a day earlier, signalling that its next chart 
point could be 1,600 points before the month is out.

Bulk of the support, however, remained centred around PTC vouchers, 
which were massively traded and the interesting feature was that it 
crossed the barrier of Rs 32 after several months of sluggishness.
Hub-Power followed it, rising sharply on active follow-up support and 
was traded massively.
    
Lucky Cement, Fauji Fertiliser and ICI Pakistan have recently joined 
the selected band of current favourites and were again heavily traded 
mostly at the higher levels.
    
Adamjee Insurance, which has been dormant for the last several weeks 
also burst into activity and rose sharply on news of strong foreign 
buying.
    
ICI Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser, Faysal Bank, Sitara Energy, Ibrahim 
Fibre and Askari Bank were among the other actives.
    
Other big gainers were led by PSO, Lever Brothers, Brooke Bond, 
Crescent Bank, Sui Southern and Sui Northern.
    
Losers were led by Fazal Textiles, National Fibre, Telecard, Pakistan 
Refinery, Dawood Hercules and Dadabhoy Insurance.
    
The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, up Rs 2.40 on 
11.775 million shares followed by Hub_power, higher 80 paisa on 7.564 
million shares, Lucky Cement, higher 60 paisa on 1.162 million shares 
and Fauji Fertiliser, easy five paisa on 511,000 shares.
    
Trading volume rose to 27 million shares from the previous 23 million 
shares, while gainers outpaced losers by a big margin at 159 to 75, 
with 70 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="inde">Independence of the judiciary  IV</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee

WHEN a minister, or a government servant, is afraid to stand up and be 
counted and chooses to speak anonymously through a third person, who 
then conveys the message to the people through the government news 
agency, the APP, it is safe to presume that he is prevaricating, that 
the opposite of what he said was true.
    
Based on this premise, a spokesman for the government on January 14 
would seem to have confirmed that the government held in respect 
neither the Chief Justice of Pakistan nor the other judges nor the 
judiciary, and that the Chief Justice had been harassed. APP revealed 
that the statement emanated from the office of the Attorney-General.
    
The Chief Justice, worried about the safety of his family, moved them 
all to Islamabad and then abroad. The CJs nephew-cum- son-in-law, 
Parvez Ali Shah, whose house was raided by the government and who was 
then arbitrarily suspended from government service, on December 18 
filed a petition (CP 2469-95) in the Sindh High Court challenging this 
suspension. It was heard by Acting CJ Hafiz Memon the same day. He 
ordered that the governments comments should reach his court by 
December 31, and the case was adjourned to January 11. There was no 
response from the government and the case was again adjourned to 
January 18. So far the government maintains its silence. The case is 
bound to be adjourned again and again. Parvez Ali Shahs brother, Ayaz 
Ali Shah of PIA, has also been suspended on a vague excuse.
    
The Attorney-General and his law officers and advisers must surely 
realise that such acts by the government smack of pure fascism.
    
According to a report, on January 15, Attorney-General Qazi Jameel 
vehemently denied that he had asked Sharifuddin Pirzada to represent 
the government in the judges case now being heard in the Supreme 
Court. Sharifuddin, however, maintains that the AG rang him up in 
November saying that at the AGs request he had been accepted by the 
court as an amicus curiae, but that the AG would prefer to engage 
Sharifuddin to represent the state. Sharifuddin declined the offer.
    
Thanks to the governments bungling and the unsuccessful attempts made 
to get the CJ to toe the government line, the judges case which 
vitally concerns the independence of the judiciary has attracted the 
attention it merits. The people, the Bar Associations, and the Fourth 
Estate have rallied round. After all, Rule 165 of the Pakistan Legal 
Practitioners and Bar Council Rules, 1976, makes it obligatory for all 
advocates to prevent political considerations from outweighing 
judicial fitness in the appointment and selection of judges. It also 
urges each practitioner of law to protest earnestly and actively 
against the appointment or selection of persons who are unsuitable for 
the Bench.
    
The members of Wukala Mahaz Barai Tahaffuz-i-Dastur, a specialised 
body of Idara Tehqiq Qanoon Pakistan (The Pakistan Institute of Legal 
Research) unanimously agreed to act and filed on the 16th of this 
month:
    
(1) a complaint under Article 209(5) of the Constitution to the 
President for the removal of the respondent judge (additional Judge 
Agha Rafique of the SHC) on the ground of misconduct;
    
(2) a petition in the Supreme Court against Federation of Pakistan and 
Additional Judge Agha Rafique under Article 184(3) for the enforcement 
of the fundamental rights of practising lawyers;
    
(3) a petition in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) against the 
Federation of Pakistan, the CJ of the Peshawar High Court, and 
Mohammed Arif Khan (who had filed in that court a petition challenging 
the appointment of Chief Justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah) for the 
enforcement of the fundamental rights of practising lawyers, 
restraining the federation from making unlawful and mala-fide 
interference in the judicial arm of the state. It, inter alia, prays 
that the court declare that WP 1172/95 filed in Peshawar is mala fide, 
having been inspired by the federation in pursuit of its vendetta 
against the Chief Justice of Pakistan;
    
(4) an application under Article 186(a) requesting the transfer of WP 
1172/95 (pending in the Peshawar HC) to the Supreme Court.
    
Dr Abdul Basit, the Founder Director of the ITQ, has also published a 
pamphlet entitled Law Lions and the Pussy Cat  resistance Campaign 
of the Pakistan Bar against Zardari Power Elite. The full texts of 
the above documents are contained in this pamphlet.
    
Now let us examine the fate of those whose lives and liberty fall 
within the purview of the judiciary:
    
MQM Senators  Ishtiaq Azhar, bailed out after 22 months; Aftab Ahmad 
Shaikh, under house arrest in Hyderabad; Nasreen Jalil, under house 
arrest in Karachi; Zahid Akhtar, under house arrest in Karachi.
    
MQM MPAs of Sindh  10 have fled the country; six are in hiding in the 
country; Dr Farooq Sattar, former mayor of Karachi and now leader of 
the opposition in the Sindh Assembly, has been in jail for close to 
two years and has this week been put in solitary confinement in 
Karachi jail; one is in Hyderabad jail; six are in Adiala jail in 
Rawalpindi; two on the negotiation committee have been enlarged on 
bail.
    
MQM party members  700 odd are incarcerated in Islamabad in camps 
euphemistically termed as safe houses. In jail  50 Adiala; 1,000 
Karachi; 28 Landhi; 287 Khairpur; 300 Sukkur; 250 Larkana; 200 
Jacobabad; 400 Hyderabad; 167 Nara; 77 Mirpurkhas. In camps  300 
Sohrab Goth; 50 National Stadium; 500 Nazimabad; 1,800 Khwaja Ajmer 
Nagri; 1,500 Kalakot; 350 New Karachi; 85 Korangi; 20 Gulberg; 35 
Gulbahar; 22 Mojka.
    
FIRs against 3,800 have been filed but no charges have so far been 
framed. The rest are not being produced in court and are incarcerated 
allegedly for murder, conspiracy to murder, riot, arson, civil 
disobedience, theft, wilful damage, etc. etc.
    
Special reference must be made to the MQM propaganda man, Kunwar 
Khalid Yunus, a former MNA. He has been jailed in Landhi for almost 
two years, he is brought to the court regularly but has so far not 
been charged. He rings me whenever he can to tell me of his fears of 
extra-judicial murder whilst in custody.
    
Qazi Khalid Ali, the MPA and advocate in charge of MQM legal affairs, 
maintains that he constantly seeks redress for his incarcerated party 
members but none has been provided to him since the departure of the 
former Chief Justice of the SHC, Nasir Aslam Zahid. I have explained 
to him that the present Acting Chief Justice, Hafiz Memon, is a good 
and humane human being but that his acting status imposes restraints 
upon him. Khalid has handed me a computerised print-out detailing the 
suffering of all those in custody, which I am forwarding to the acting 
Chief Justice.
    
I can say without fear of any contradiction that if we had a truly 
independent judiciary over 50 per cent of those now locked up would be 
home and free.
    
Back to the judges case scheduled to recommence on January 21. 
Hearings started at the very beginning of November and no progress has 
been made. Now that the former Attorney-General, Yahya Bakhtiar, has 
been brought in to defend the governments case, there is no reason 
why there should not be further adjournments. He may well be sent away 
to attend various international conferences.

<a name="priv">Private jails: why no legal action?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ghani Eirabie

IT is good to know that the Prime Minister has sent down her human 
rights adviser to recover bonded haris from private jails in Sindh 
and there are plans to rehabilitate them. But it is disturbing to find 
no news of any police crackdown or arrest of any of wrong-doers on 
charge of practising slavery, forbidden by both law and religion.
    
If no law was violated by the misuse of haris as free field labour or 
the sexual abuse of their women in the havelis, there should not 
have been any fanfare over their retrieval by the Prime Ministers 
aide. But if forcible detention of human beings in private jails in 
the 20th century and the humiliation of hapless women in the Islamic 
Republic of Pakistan constitute a criminal offence, how come the 
perpetrators of the crime have not been hauled up. Also how come, no 
district official D.C. or S.P. has been suspended for grave 
dereliction of duty.
    
There is something seriously wrong with our society; the evil can be 
identified as continuation of the feudal scourge. The much vaunted 
land reforms of President Ayub Khan and Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali 
Bhutto were cosmetic, half-hearted measures, and they resulted neither 
in ensuring distributive justice, nor in dilution of the waderas 
political clout.
    
Lest it be presumed that the feudal virus infects Sindh alone, one 
needs to recall a hair-raising episode of July 5 last when a housewife 
was produced before the Lahore High Court, tied up in chains  not as 
an officially sentenced criminal from a state prison-house, but as the 
inmate of a private jail, produced exactly as found by the court 
bailiff  chained and shackled. The 40-year old Sakina had been 
abducted by landlord Dost Mohammad of Malakwal (Mandi Bahauddin) 
following her husband Allah Dittas failure to repay an alleged loan 
of Rs 5,000 and consigned to a dungeon  and used as field labour 
during the day and for carnal pleasure at night. Also confined with 
her were her two young boys aged four and 11; while her two growing- 
up daughters were held in slavery by a neighbouring zamindar.
    
The difference, however, lies in the way the two provinces have 
reacted. The Lahore High Court has the landlord arrested and a case 
registered against him on charges of abduction, illegal confinement, 
and murder of the 15-day infant allegedly killed in the kicking around 
of Sakina at the time of her abduction.
    
The Court sharply rebuked the SHO for kow-towing to the local 
influentials and threatened action. As against this, there are no 
reports of the Sindh High Court taking any suo motto notice of the 
several publicly-disclosed cases of unlawful confinement, torture and 
rape each of them more serious than the one in Punjab.
    
The Sindhi Press has long been reporting the existence of private 
jails and even torture centres across the land, particularly in places 
like Tando Allahyar and Sanghar and Umerkot  and at one time, the 
papers featured the private prison of Sardar Khair Mohammad Khokhar  
but there has seldom been any response from the administration. The 
credit for the latest raids too goes not to the police but to human 
rights activists. It was the workers of the Jeay Sindh Taraqqi-Pasand 
Party that made a surprise raid this month on the private jail of 
landlord Amir Shah in Deh Manyan in taluka Gularchi of Badin district 
and rescued 40 bonded haris including 21 women and children.
    
The modus operandi is the same in trapping both landless peasants and 
brick-kiln workers namely lending them money and having them sign 
blank papers and levying a rate of interest that would shame even a 
Jewish money-lender, and escalating the payable amount to a level that 
no hari or worker can pay back in a life-time. That manoeuvre ties up 
the entire family in bondage, generation after generation and reduces 
them to the level of chattel, transferred from one owner to another. 
This loan- sharking is the root-cause of the evil and has to be 
stamped out with all the force of law.
    
If the present battery of laws is not enough, a new presidential 
ordinance can be issued repudiating all such loans. There is nothing 
very novel about the idea; rural indebtedness has been liquidated by 
governmental fiat in the past too  in the pre-partition Punjab and in 
several provinces of post-Partition India. It needs to be repeated in 
todays Pakistan.
    
Even failing such a measure, non-payment of debts is something to be 
dealt with through courts of law and not treated as justification for 
enslavement of the indebted family. In the case of the Malakwal case, 
the Lahore High Court directed the landlord that if he was owed any 
money, he should file a civil suit to recover his legitimate dues but 
he could not take the law into his own hands.
    
Over and above the promulgation of an ordinance liquidating illegally 
inflated debts, several other measures are also indicated. These 
include another instalment of honest-to-God land reforms, breaking up 
overly large fiefs and distributing the released land fairly among the 
landless peasants. The liquidation of feudalism is imperative if any 
equitable economic or representative political system is to succeed in 
Pakistan.
    
But this is a long-term measure, for which ground has to be prepared 
by sustained vigorous campaigning over a period of time. But until the 
ultimate goal is achieved, the more glaring of the abuses of the 
feudal system have to be exposed and purged; and topping the list are 
such vicious practices as enslaving hapless farm peasants and factory 
workers through fake loans and holding them to ransom in private jails 
or behind barbed-wire fences, and using men as free field labour and 
their women for carnal pleasure.
    
Equally important is the urgency of retrieving the bureaucracy from 
the stranglehold of the waderas. It is common knowledge that the 
local influentials employ their political clout, acquired through 
domination of the legislators and consequently of the party 
governments, to influence the recruitment, promotion, posting and 
transfer of district, police and revenue officials, who then, impelled 
by self-interest, tend to defer to the wishes of the landlords and 
even cover up their criminal activities.
    
This is confirmed by the Lahore High Courts rebuke to the area police 
office and by the Hyderabad statement of Prime Ministers aide Kamran 
Rizvi that he had taken very serious notice of the indifferent 
attitude of the police and the administration and ordered a judicial 
inquiry.

However, the unholy nexus between the bureaucrats and the local 
influentials will not end until political tampering with the 
administration has been eliminated.
    
None of these objectives can be achieved without mobilising public 
opinion; and the primary responsibility for arousing popular 
consciousness lies with the national Press which is now free enough to 
play a meaningful role in ridding the society of its scourges.

<a name="ther">The rot of corruption</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

THE Indian law enforcement agencies have moved against some political 
leaders on charges of- corruption. One of them is the leader of the 
opposition, Mr. L.K. Advani. Had all the gentlemen concerned belonged 
only to the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main rival of the ruling 
Congress-I and leading contender for power in the forthcoming general 
elections, one could have dismissed the matter as another case of a 
government using its power to corner its opponents. But three people 
wanted by the police in a Rs 650 million bribery scandal also happen 
to be central ministers. They have now resigned from office regarding 
this as the only honorable course to follow in such circumstances, 
until their innocence is proved. This is not quite an extraordinary 
event, at least not in the context of established democracies. 
Political corruption is not something unheard of in the developed 
countries of the West as well as in the Third World. Some politicians, 
especially those in office, are known to "take with both hands". 
Neither is it unusual in the countries where accountability is the 
established norm, for persons in office to resign when serious charges 
are brought against them. Many a political career has been ruined 
because of disclosures of improprieties and wrongdoing.

What is significant about the development in India is the fact that 
the Central Bureau of Investigation could proceed in the matter 
independently and the prime minister did not try to protect his 
ministers. Presumably the law will now take its course. One wonders 
why this cannot happen in Pakistan. Political corruption has reached 
its highest point in this country. With Pakistan rated as the third 
most corrupt state in the world by Transparency International, it has 
now come to be widely accepted that corruption at all levels is a fact 
of life. But it is time we shed our tolerant attitude towards this 
evil and something was done to eradicate political corruption which is 
the root of all other evils in politics, economics and administration. 
When those wielding political power are susceptible to amassing wealth 
through grafts, commissions and kickbacks, they destroy the people's 
trust in government. This also distorts national planning because, in  
many cases, an investor's capacity to grease palms rather than the 
feasibility and importance of a project determines whether or not the 
necessary clearance and facilities would be forthcoming. This can be 
extremely demoralizing.

It is disturbing that the ruling party which has had charges of 
corruption leveled against some of its functionaries and their family 
members has chosen to treat the matter with studied indifference. 
There has been a lot of talk about weeding out corruption and charges 
have been brought against politiciansalbeit those in the opposition. 
Not that the exhausters are angels who did no wrong when they ruled 
the roost. But taking them to task while turning a blind eye to 
corrupt politicians in the ruling party hardly lends credibility to 
the whole exercise. Hence if the prime minister really means what she 
says about her resolve to root out corruption, she should make a 
beginning with members of her own party and their kith and kin. This 
will reassure the people that she is not indulging in a witch-hunt 
against her opponents but is actively seeking to inject a measure of 
honesty and rectitude into politics. It will also deny the opposition 
an opportunity to present itself as a target of political 
victimization.

It is time the Federal Anti-Corruption Committee was strengthened and 
its scope and powers enhanced. Comprising 19 members of the National 
Assembly, the FACC has found itself quite helpless before the power 
and reach of the corrupt and the protection they receive from their 
patrons and benefactors in the highest quarters. This is a situation 
which needs to be corrected right away. The composition of the FACC 
must be changed and all major parties, including those in the 
opposition, should be represented in the committee. It should also be 
given independent powers of investigation and prosecution. If the FACC 
charges any holder of public office with corruption, is essential that 
he/she be asked to resign until the matter has been adjudged with 
finality. This is important if a fair trial is to be held. Above all, 
those found guilty of corruption should be deprived of their ill-
gotten wealth apart from whatever other punishment is meted out to 
them.

<a name="stra">Strange tidings from across the border</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

WHAT are Pakistanis supposed to make of the bribery scandal which has 
shaken the Indian political establishment? After being accused of 
receiving hefty payments from a leading Indian businessman, three 
cabinet ministers have resigned while the BJP leader, Lal Krishna 
Advani, has resigned from the Lok Sabha saying that he first wants his 
name to be cleared in court.
    
No one as yet has been proven guilty, the Central Bureau of 
Investigation still being in the process of filing charges against the 
accused. But even before the start of legal procedures, the ministers 
named in the scandal have thought it proper to step down from the 
cabinet just as Advani who is a national leader has thought it fit to 
resign from the Lok Sabha.
    
By this single act alone Indian politics are not placed on a higher 
pedestal than the practice of this art in Pakistan. India in general 
and its politics in particular are as corrupt and sordid as anything 
to be found in this country. After all, we have more in common with 
each other than just our mutual antipathy. Even so, there must be some 
difference somewhere because what has just happened in India would be 
unthinkable in Pakistan. Politicians and other leaders here are made 
of sterner stuff. They never resign, usually not for anything in the 
world, and certainly not for anything as inconsequential as a 
suspicion of bribery.
    
Since the last ten years, during which with the restoration of 
democracy a measure of openness has entered Pakistani politics, the 
cupboards of the Islamic Republic have rattled with the skeletons of 
the most incredible scandals. But no one has been punished as a 
consequence. Nor has any champion of democracy ever entertained the 
mind-boggling thought of quitting office even when accused of things 
for which there is reasonable proof. Indeed, although the scale of 
corruption has reached epic proportions, it would be considered a 
laughable proposition in Pakistan to suggest that a serious effort 
should be made to clean the higher echelons of government which today 
set the pace of national corruption.

And what is the precise nature of the charges in the current Indian 
scandal? That over a period of four years a clutch of Indian 
politicians took bribes totalling 30 million dollars from Surendra 
Jain, the businessman who is the key suspect in the case. Amazing. 
Thirty million dollars divided among a fairly long list of politicians 
and spread over four years. In Pakistan these days 30 million dollars 
is small change that can change hands during the course of a single 
deal. One of the most mirth- provoking words in the Pakistani 
political lexicon these days is transparency. Everyone swears by it 
even if everyone knows that today nothing is transparent: not arms and 
business deals nor the gargantua of privatisation.
    
In our democracy today people have a fairly shrewd idea of the broad 
outlines of what is happening, about who is making what and who is 
fronting for whom but without being privy to all the details. Take 
Asif Zardaris ponies of whom it is generally known that they are 
stabled in the Prime ministers house. But what is their exact number? 
How much money has been paid for them? Does their stabling in the 
prime ministers house promote the progress and prosperity of the 
nation? To these questions there are no clear answers.
    
The congenitally simple-minded can of course object that whereas in 
the Indian scandal there are precise grounds available to justify 
prosecution, there has been nothing like this in Pakistan. Was not the 
co-operatives scandal in 1989 an open-and-shut case? Did it not 
deprive half a million people of their savings? And yet did any heads 
roll as a consequence? If there were some high priests of the then 
PML-N government involved in the intricacies of that scandal so was 
Senator Gulzar Ahmed who has always been close to the present prime 
minister. No harm appears to have come to any of them.
    
And what about General Aslam Begs reluctant admission that, yes, he 
took 14 crores, no less, from that champion banker, Yunus Habib of the 
sadly-defunct Mehran Bank? If ever a Nelsonian eye was turned towards 
anything in this country where the sturdy fashion all along has been 
to brush unwelcome facts under the carpet, it was towards this 
admission which in any other country pretending to be a democracy 
would have caused a seismic upheaval.
    
If revelations of this magnitude cause no more than the temporary 
discomfort which comes from reading unwelcome news, is it to be 
wondered  if the disclosure that a former chief justice made a tidy 
profit by selling a residential plot which was allotted to him on 
specious grounds and for which he had petitioned a chief minister, 
should cause scarcely a ripple anywhere? If all the well-documented 
scandals involving shady business deals which have been reported in 
the Press over the last six to seven years were put together they 
would form a hefty anthology. But applaud the standards of public 
morality which have to come to prevail in the Islamic Republic because 
none of these scandals has resulted in a single prosecution.
    
For all the well-founded charges against Irfanullah Marwat regarding 
his taste in PIA air hostesses, nothing has happened to him while the 
case against his CIA sidekick, Saleemullah Marwat, has been largely 
forgotten. In the Mehran Bank scandal poor Yunus Habib has had to cool 
his heels in jail while all those who were the objects of his largesse 
from General Beg to Aftab Sherpao go preaching their sermons to the 
country.
    
Or consider the latest offering of this government which in the 
history books will no doubt be known as Benazirs Second Empire: the 
proposed sale of the majority shares of Pakistan Petroleum Limited 
(the company which owns the Sui gas field) and a stake in the money-
making Qadirpur gas field to the hotelier Hashwani. President Farooq 
Leghari in no uncertain terms has objected to this sale as neither 
being transparent nor in the national interest. At the last ECC 
meeting this issue did not figure in the original agenda and was added 
to it only at the last minute. Such things do not happen in Pakistan 
just like that. The haste with which this matter has been dealt with 
strongly suggests that some powerful interests are behind this deal. 
Who are they and what do they stand to gain from it?
    
Democratic purists, of whom there is no shortage in our half- baked 
democracy, regularly take a stand against the Eighth Amendment which 
empowers the President to keep an eye on the workings of government. 
This power of his may go against the principles of parliamentary 
sovereignty but it is entirely in keeping with the muck of our 
politics because the apostles of Pakistani democracy have given ample 
proof that, left to themselves and their devices, they can scarcely be 
trusted. Suppose the President had not intervened in the proposed PPL 
deal. In that case, just because somebodys private interest is at 
stake, a major strategic sale affecting the countrys long- term 
interests would have gone through without subjecting it to proper 
scrutiny.
    
Yet the Petroleum Minister, Anwar Saifullah, who as a business tycoon 
should not have been placed in charge of a lucrative ministry in the 
first place, is protesting the innocence and high merit of this 
proposed deal even if his arguments convince no one. With such a 
presidential censure on his back, a minister in any other country 
pretending to be an accountable democracy would have been quickly in 
trouble if not promptly out of office. But not in Pakistan, where the 
tradition of not being answerable for corruption or wrongdoing has 
been solidly established as a leading principle of government.
    
Ever since Benazirs First Empire in 1988 and through the Nawaz Sharif 
era till today, it has been the common refrain of politicians or other 
bigwigs charged with corruption that they are innocent because nothing 
has been proved against them. Nothing has become of the charges that 
were brought against Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari by President 
Ghulam Ishaq Khan. Knowing the way such things operate in Pakistan, it 
is reasonably certain that nothing will become of the miasma of 
charges brought against the two Sharifs. For one the framing of these 
charges is not honest because the spirit behind them is that of 
victimisation. But even otherwise, in this God-gifted Republic nothing 
ever is proved against anyone: from patwaris, thanedars and bankers 
to the subverters of constitutional authority. If established proof 
alone was the criterion to judge the existence or the absence of 
corruption then this must be the cleanest country in the world and its 
leaders the most honest of their fraternity.
    
To think of the matter is to be convinced that there is something 
stirring in the attitude of our governing class. Nothing that may be 
brought against its members makes the slightest difference. The Press 
may rant and rave, the most incredible tales of money-making may form 
the staple of drawing-room conversation, but for all the effect that 
these things have on the countrys leadership they might never have 
been said at all. Hence the anomaly that whereas the Press is free its 
barb has lost its sting. Which should not be surprising because the 
word spoken or written in censure has meaning or effect only in a 
society where the rule of law in all its amplitude prevails. For all 
the comprehensiveness of Macaulays legal code which forms the basis 
of Pakistani and Indian jurisprudence, ours is still not a society 
which can lay claim to this distinction.
    
There is no cause for despair, however, because this remains a sturdy 
and resilient land. If what has been done to it throughout its history 
were to be suffered by a professional woman of the streets during the 
course of a single calendar day, she would beg divine forgiveness and 
renounce her errant ways. But this country goes on while its people, 
heroic in their fortitude, have learnt to live with their destiny.

CONSIDERING the unusually long time it has taken for arrangements for 
the implementation of the Karachi mass transit system to be finalised, 
the news that work on the project will begin before the end of the 
year will be received with a measure of scepticism. Hopes of an early 
commencement of work on the project have been raised from time to time 
- only to be dampened by some unforeseen development at the last 
minute or a procedural hitch of one kind or another. However, the 
prospects this time look brighter than at any time in the past with 
the signing of a 590-million dollar agreement between a Canadian 
consortium and the National Mass Transit Authority (NMTA) in Islamabad 
the other day for the implementation of the long delayed project. The 
conclusion of this deal means that a formidable hurdle - the financing 
of the project's 60 percent cost from private sources - has been 
overcome at last. This then should be taken as the much-awaited green 
signal for work to begin on the KMTP in right earnest. 

Under the present plans, the balance of 40 percent of the project cost 
will be met by the government, in the form of land to be made 
available for the construction of the partly elevated railway serving 
some of the most congested parts of the city. The Canadian consortium 
will meet its commitment of funds by raising loans in an equity-debt 
ratio of 20:80, which the government determined as an inducement to 
foreign private investors in May last year, after the World Bank 
backed out of its pledge to put up funds to cover 30 to 40 per cent of 
the cost of the infrastructure facilities for the project. Ideally, 
the loans should be raised externally, as this will also take care of 
the foreign exchange component of the cost. However, it is hoped that 
all conceivable wrinkles have finally been ironed out and that there 
will be no further delay in the launching of the-project either for 
technical or bureaucratic reasons.

It appears that the agreement signed with the Canadian consortium is 
confined to what was originally conceived as the 15-kilometre priority 
Corridor (Sohrab Goth to Merewether Tower) of an 87-kilometre partly 
elevated light rail system to serve as the pivotal part of a 
comprehensive and efficient transport network for Karachi. Even the 
route of Corridor was realigned some two years after it was firmed up, 
to meet some environmentalist objections and to avoid serious 
dislocation of business in M.A. Jinnah Road area which is perhaps the 
city's busiest trading district. The realigned route has now been 
split into two phases the first connecting Merewether Tower to 
Karimabad and the second linking Karimabad with Sohrab Goth. It is 
estimated that work on the project will be completed within 56 months 
but the time schedule for the completion of each phase has not been 
specifically indicated. However, it is hoped that there would be no 
significant timelag between the completion of the first phase and the 
commencement of work on the second phase.

The fate of priority Corridor II (Orangi Town to Cantonment station) 
under the original plans for Karachi's mass transit project is still 
not known. One hopes that it has only been postponed and not abandoned 
altogether. The basic design for this second corridor was completed by 
a French firm of consultants in June 1994 and the environmental study 
and resettlement plans were then said to be in an advanced stage. The 
revamping of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR), which has also been 
proposed from time to time, should also be taken in hand at the 
earliest, as it is absolutely indispensable to the immediate as well 
as long-term needs of the ever growing number of commuters in Karachi. 
With Pakistan poised to enter the 21st century, the provision of an 
adequate and efficient mass transit system for Karachi can only be 
viewed as a critical need of the entire country's industrial and 
commercial progress.

<a name="moun">Mounting debt burden</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed

PAKISTANS external debt service payments have exceeded two billion 
dollars, making it a landmark in the history of our increasing 
external indebtedness. That happened in the last financial year, 
according to updated official figures, but that tells only a part of 
the story.
    
It relates to only long and medium-term loans, and not the increasing 
short-term loans and the use of over seven billion dollars handed over 
to the State Bank of Pakistan by commercial banks in Pakistan as 
deposits made by resident and non-resident Pakistanis or brought in by 
foreign banks to enlarge their operations in Pakistan.
    
As against such vast liabilities Pakistan has a small gross foreign 
exchange reserve of 1.5 billion dollars, and, that too, as a result of 
hasty external borrowing to boost the reserve after it had slipped to 
one billion dollars from 2.737 billion dollars on July 1 last in 
liquid form.
    
The long and medium-term debt out of the total external aid of 53 
billion dollars received so far was 21.6 billion on July 1, while 11 
billion dollars were stuck up in the pipeline due to inefficiency in 
use of aid or for want of matching rupee funds. If the short-term 
debt, private sector borrowing from abroad, suppliers credit to 
industrial investors and the seven billion dollars from commercial 
banks used by the government are added up, the total foreign exchange 
liability of the country will be around 35 billion dollars, as against 
the 1.5 billion gross reserve, unlike the liquid reserve mentioned by 
the State Bank so far.
    
Look at the diversity of short term loans reported in one day  
December 27: Foreign banks combined to lend 200 million dollars for 
Pakistans petroleum imports. Bank of America lends 200 million 
dollars for import of wheat. Seven foreign Banks led by the Bank of 
America arrange for a syndicated loan of Rs 1.944 billion to WAPDA.
    
And on the private sector side, following the loans given by the 
International Finance Corporation, an affiliate of the World Bank to 
few Modarabas, the Asian Development Bank has approved 60 million 
dollars of long-term loans to four major leasing companies. The IFC 
loans to the Modarabas remained in the pipe- line for long as 
Modarabas could not secure interest-bearing loans and so the same has 
been converted into investment which would mean the Modarabas paying 
far more to the IMF than for the low interest rate loans.
    
If the debt servicing cost of the short-term loans is added to the 
cost of servicing of the long and medium-term loans, the total will be 
around three billion dollars. And that is a large figure for a country 
whose exports have not exceeded 8 million dollars, and the deficit in 
the balance of trade in the first half of the year ending December 31 
was as large as two billion dollars. The home remittances appear to be 
falling after they rose to 1.866 billion dollars last year, despite 
the higher targets set. But all that is not discouraging the 
government from entering into large foreign exchange commitments. The 
proposed new Lahore air terminal, which may cost far more than 220 
million dollars following the additions approved by the federal 
cabinet, is to be financed by a private sector builder, but his 
foreign exchange commitments will be guaranteed by the Pakistan 
government. Similar is the case in respect of many other foreign 
funded projects.
    
Clearly this strategy has severe limitations. Debt servicing payments 
will exceed Rs 160 billion this year out of the estimated tax revenues 
of Rs 265 billion. And if the defence outlay of Rs 115 billion is 
added to that, they exceed the tax revenues. So the government has to 
borrow from at home and abroad, increase the heavy debt burden, and 
stunt the crucial social sector development for want of funds.
    
Several remedies have been suggested to contain this situation and 
reduce the national debt and the heavy debt servicing cost. Among them 
is a ban on excess spending by the government each year and a ceiling 
on the debt it can incur each year. If the government has to break 
these limits it has to come before the Parliament and explain the 
reasons. And immediately, the privatisation funds have to be used for 
reducing the huge national debt, inclusive of the domestic debt of 
over Rs 800 billion and total foreign exchange debt of around 35 
billion dollars.
    
At this time the interest which President Farooq Leghari is taking in 
the privatisation of major public sector units is heartening. Earlier 
he had called for clean and transparent privatisation and urged the 
government to avoid the methodologies for which the PPP had attacked 
the Nawaz Sharif government. Major enterprises like the UBL, (26 per 
cent of the shares) Sui Southern gas Company, Kot Adu Power station 
and Habib Bank are billed for privatisation along with others in 1996. 
And President wants to be fully briefed on that. But it is not enough 
if he satisfies himself that the transactions are fair and 
transparent, and that the major units have been given to the right 
buyers who will develop and expand them as well. He has also to make 
sure the sales proceeds of the privatisation go to reduce the enormous 
national debt, internal and external.
    
There is a clear and insistent national consensus on the use of sales 
proceeds of privatisation to reduce the national debt. But the 
government is pretty vague about it and does not come up with firm 
commitments. Nor has it used the sale proceeds of the PTC shares of Rs 
30 billion for reducing the debt.
    
And now the World Bank in its Annual Economic Review of Pakistans 
economy in 1994-95 says Rs 26.1 billion out of the total income of Rs 
30 billion from privatisation has been used for financing the 
budgetary deficit and the Social Action Programme. It says Rs 6.1 
billion was used for financing the deficit and Rs 3 billion was 
provided to WAPDA and only Rs 5 billion for SAP. The budget provides 
for Rs 12 billion from the privatisation funds for SAP this year.
    
It is not often that the nation will be disposing of large projects 
like major banks and power and gas companies. It is, therefore, 
imperative that when the major assets of the nation are liquidated its 
major liabilities, too must be liquidated. If not, we will be mired in 
an ocean of debt too difficult to get out without serious damage to 
us.
    
The government had proposed to set up a future Generation Fund out 
of sales proceeds of privatisation. But the fact is that if the sales 
proceeds are not used to reduce the large national debt we will be 
burdening the future generations with heavy debt and doing a major 
disservice to them. Must we do that when we have this rare golden 
opportunity to slash the heavy debt, reduce the vast official 
expenditure in the non-productive sector, reduce taxation and give a 
boost to the economy and make it go bouncing? President Leghari has a 
major role to play in this area. He should not hesitate or prevaricate 
when the national consensus is too clear, and care-taker Prime 
Minister Moeen Qureshi gave the lead by setting up a Debt Reduction 
Fund which remains empty for want of an earnest follow-up by his 
successors.
    
If the national debt is slashed, and the government reduces its 
borrowing, the interest rates will come down and more funds will be 
available for trade and industry in this age when the private sector 
is expected to invest and develop industries and the infrastructure. 
Along with more bank loans becoming available the interest rates will 
also come down, and the rate of inflation which is officially 14 
percent and far higher otherwise will fall. Then, savings and 
investment will rise, and larger savings and cheaper loans will 
promote industrial development. And that is what the country needs 
desperately now if the massive unemployment is not to aggravate the 
political and social tensions.
    
Look at the kind of leaps many Asian countries are making in the 
industrial sphere. Production rise in Indonesia is 20.6 per cent, 
Philippines 18.4 per cent, Thailand 11.6 per cent and China 14 per 
cent. Compared to that our target this year is only 6.8 per cent, and 
with too many of our industries, including textiles, sugar, paper and 
jute manufacturers, in trouble, and about 4,000 industrial units sick, 
how much of industrial growth will be recorded this year aided by the 
far larger cotton crop remains to be seen.
    
Can we achieve in Pakistan what India has been able to do in respect 
of inflation, interest rates and savings? Of course, the State Bank is 
applying the squeeze in respect of money supply and bank credit, but 
that alone is not enough to bring down inflation to a single digit as 
some of the officials are predicting. High production costs, 
exorbitant interest rates, and high taxes give a boost to inflation, 
while the increase in production is not significant, except in cotton.
    
Our economic liberation has to begin by cutting down the huge national 
debt, with less official borrowing, cheaper credit and lower 
inflation, and the President has to take a lead in that direction now.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="piar">PIA regain National one-day title after nine years</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ilyas Beg

SHEIKHUPURA, Jan 19: Outplaying Rawalpindi A side in all departments 
of the game, PIA regained the title in the 15th Wills Cup Cricket 
Tournament at the Shafqat Naghmi Stadium. PIA defeated Rawalpindi A by 
seven wickets in the final, consuming only 30.5 overs.
    
National Captain, Wasim Akram, leading the PIA team, won the toss and 
put Rawalpindi A side in to bat. The decision paid off because he read 
the pitch correctly. Leading the team from the front, Wasim Akram 
helped in restricting the Rawalpindi side to a paltry score of 124. 
Excepting Zubair Nadeem (36 with two fours) none of the Rawalpindi 
batsmen could cope with the pace and spin attack of PIA.
    
Wasim Akram took four wickets for 21 runs and rightly won the Man-of-
the-Final award. He was paid for his sustained bowling at good length 
and good direction.
    
After the early fall of Shoaib Mohammad who ballooned a catch to 
Mohammad Riaz at mid-wicket, the PIA batsmen galloped to the victory 
target. Opener Ghulam Ali (51 with six boundaries) and Zahid Fazal (45 
with three fours) added 73 precious runs in 76 minutes off 126 balls 
to take PIA very near to victory.

Ghulam Ali stayed at the crease for 111 minutes, faced 82 balls and 
hit six well-timed boundaries in his fine knock of 51. Ghulam Ali 
mistimed a ball from Shakeel Ahmad and holed out a catch to Mohammad 
Akram at mid-off but after taking PIA quite close to victory.
    
The second wicket fell at the total of 112. Zahid Fazal, having been 
dropped by Pervaiz Iqbal off Shakeel Ahmad, was finally out to a catch 
by Mohammad Akram at long-Off boundary off the first ball of Mohammad 
Riazs second spell. Zahid Fazal hit three fours in his stay of 85 
minutes at the crease in which he played 71 balls. He hit a fluent 
knock of 45.  The third PIA wicket fell at the total of 116.
    
At that stage, PIA was at the hand-shaking distance from win. Sagheer 
Abbas (3) and Asif Mujtaba (6) took PIA to the victory-target without 
being separated. With the score tied at 124, umpire Mian Mohammad 
Aslam declared a bouncer from Naeem Akhtar as wide-ball and PIA 
reached the coveted total due to that extra run. PIA coasted home to a 
facile seven-wicket win.

Led by Test all-rounder Wasim Akram and ably supported by young 
paceman Nadeem Afzal and Test off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, PIA bowling 
did not allow the Rawalpindi innings to prosper during the morning 
session of play. The PIA bowlers fully exploited the moisture in the 
rain-soaked pitch and bowled with sustained hostility to bundle out 
Rawalpindi for a dismal score of 124 in only 165 minutes, using only 
42.5 overs out of the stipulated 45 overs.
    
Wasim Akram not only accounted for the Test opener Aamir Sohail but 
also mopped up the tail by claiming the wickets of Naeem Akhtar (18), 
Pervaiz Iqbal (9) and Mohammad Akram (4) to finish with the best 
figures of four for 21 in 7.5 overs.

Nadeem Afzal bowled unchanged from the pavilion end to complete his 
quota of nine overs. He was rewarded with two wickets for 24 runs. 
Saqlain Mushtaq, claimed the wickets of captain Naseer Ahmad (11) and 
Asif Mahmood (2), conceding 30 runs.
    
The only batsman who showed some fighting ability was Zubair Nadeem. 
He was bowled by a leg-break off Asif Mujtaba, who knocked his off-
stump with a ball of low trajectory. Zubair Nadeem stayed at the 
crease for 77 minutes, faced 62 balls and hit two boundaries in his 
top-score of 36.
    
Aamir Sohail, survived 31 minutes, played 29 deliveries and hit only 
one boundary in his score of 12 before snicking a delivery of Wasim 
Akram into the safe hands of wicketkeeper Moin Khan. The second 
Rawalpindi wicket fell at the total of 21.
    
Earlier, opener Naveed Qureshi had offered a catch to Wasim Akram at 
the total 13 off the delivery of Nadeem Afzal to give the youngster 
his first wicket. In the 16th over, Arif Butt (9) missed the line of 
delivery from Nadeem Afzal and was declared leg before. Thereafter 
Saqlain Mushtaq destabilised the middle-order while Wasim Akram 
accounted for the tail-enders.

<a name="aust">Australia clinch World Series in rain-hit thriller</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihithisham Kamardeen

SYDNEY, Jan. 20: Australia clinched the World Series one-day cricket 
finals 2-0 in dramatic circumstances tonight after Sri Lanka failed by 
eight runs in a rain-shortened frantic chase at the SCG.
    
Australias 273 for five from 50 overs looked impenetrable but a 
thunderstorm during the dinner break left the visitors chasing a 
revised target of 168 from 25 overs at 6.72 per over.
    
They had the luxury of only two men outside the fielding circle for 15 
overs and made a flying start but lost wickets regularly to poor 
shots.
    
At 135 for five, Sri Lanka needed 33 off five overs but legspinner 
Shane Warne returned to get captain Arjuna Ranatunga for 41 and Kumara 
Dharmasena for seven and Mark Waugh ran out Hashan Tillakaratne for 25 
to make it 146 for eight.
    
With 22 needed off 11 balls and 17 off the last over, Sri Lanka ended 
on 159 for eight. Warne finished with 3-20 from his five overs to 
claim a Joint Player of the Finals Award after his 2-29 from 10 overs 
proved the turning point in Australias 18-run win in Melbourne. 
Captains Mark Taylor shared the award with Warne.
    
Opener Sanath Jayasuriya hammered 30 from 26 balls but lofted a long 
hop from Warne straight to Glenn McGrath at deep midwicket. McGrath 
had earlier been reported to Taylor by umpire Steve Randell for 
blocking Jayasuriyas path on a single after the batsman took 13 from 
his third over.
    
The lanky paceman gave Australia the ideal start by trapping dasher 
Romesh Kaluwitharana, the Player of the Series from the preliminary 
rounds, lbw for a first ball duck.
    
Offspinner Mark Waugh then had Aravinda de Silva caught by Paul 
Reiffel at mid-off for six after the seamer dropped a tough chance 
when Jayasuriya was eight.
    
The slippery ball made life tough for the Australians and one throw 
went through three fieldsmen for overthrows. But Warne held a good 
catch to dismiss Asanka Gurusinha for 24 and Taylor did likewise to 
Ruwan Kalpage (9) to make it 87 for five in the 13th over.
    
Earlier, a majestic 73 off 82 balls by Mark Waugh and an equally 
punishing 82 off 96 balls by Taylor set up Australias formidable 5-
273 - the fourth highest limited: overs total at the SCG.
    
They put on 135 in 25 overs for the first wicket after being sent in. 
They took full toll of a lightning fast outfield, a loose line from 
the Sri Lankan bowlers and some sloppy fielding to notch the highest 
score of the series.
    
Taylor and Waugh gleaned 34 from the first ten overs then hammered 71 
from the next ten to register their second century stand of the 
competition in 87 minutes.
    
Waugh was spectacularly caught and bowled by offspinner Kalpage for 73 
to take his tournament tally to 357 runs at 35.70 and put more 
pressure on Test opener Michael Slater.
    
Taylor is still seeking his maiden one-day century, having also made 
90 and 85 against Sri Lanka this season in chalking up 423 runs at 
42.30.
    
The middle order lost its way as Kalpage (2-47) and fellow off 
Dharmasena (2-45) applied the brakes and brought the run rate back 
below five per over. From a healthy 1-170 in the 32nd over Australia 
lost 4-40 to be 210 for five in the 43rd.
    
Left-hander Michael Bevan and wicketkeeper Ian Healy, the batting 
heroes of Australias win in the first final, then smacked 63 runs in 
34 minutes from 47 balls.
    
Bevan finished with 32 not out to take his series total to 389 at the 
phenomenal average of 194.50 while Healy chapped in with an unbeaten 
40 from 28 balls to follow his 50 not out at the MCG.
    
Leftarm paceman Chaminda Vaas was again the pick of the bowlers with 
1-47 after opening spells of 0-12 from four and 0-20 from six. 
Grusinha missed with a throw that would have run Taylor out on nought 
and made it 1-9, while Ranatunga dropped Healy on 13 at 238 for five.
    
The two sides havent seen the last of each other  the third Test 
starts in Adelaide and they meet again in their opening World Cup 
match in Colombo on Feb. 14.
