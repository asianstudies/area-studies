<a name="bomb">Bomb blast near Bhai Pheru : 50 perish in bus inferno </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Intikhab Hanif

LAHORE, April 28: At least 50 people, including women and children, were 
killed most of them reduced to ashes when a powerful bomb ripped through 
a crowded passenger bus at Kot Radha Kishan stop in Bhai Pheru, some 
60km from here. Twenty-nine others were injured, most of them 
critically.
  
The bus (FDJ 9176), on its way to Multan from Lahore, caught fire 
following the blast at around 10:30am and turned into a flaming trap. 
Only those who had alighted at Bhai Pheru escaped the inferno. Most of 
the occupants were consumed by the flames as they tried to come out.
  
Thirty-six bodies have been counted and limbs and parts of many others 
were found making the actual count difficult. Many of the injured died 
on way to the hospital.

Most of the passengers were travelling from Lahore to their home towns 
to celebrate the Eid-ul-Azha. The administration has termed the blast an 
act of terrorism.
  
The bomb was placed under a seat near the fuel tank of the bus. It 
exploded, according to the driver, as the bus was moving out of the Bhai 
Pheru stand for its onward journey.
  
Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Arif Nakai was scheduled to pass through 
Bhai Pheru near Pattoki at about the same time when the explosion took 
place. He, however, went home through Raiwind and later visited the site 
of the explosion.
  
When this correspondent reached the site, the 72-seater bus had been 
reduced to a charred wreck.
  
According to eyewitnesses, the vehicle was packed to capacity and 
passengers were even sitting on the roof, standing between the seats and 
crowding the entrance. Most of those sitting on the roof suffered minor 
injuries. Of the few survivors from among those inside the bus were its 
driver, Muhammad Aslam and conductor Khalid of Manga Mandi, who have 
been admitted to Mayo Hospital in Lahore.
  
The explosion made people around run helter skelter in confusion. A 
terrified boy said he was present in the shop of his brother when the 
bomb exploded.
  
People rushed to help but an object near the bus mistaken for a bomb 
kept them away. Eyewitnesses said the explosion was so powerful and the 
fire so intense that 99 per cent of the passengers did not have a chance 
to come out. They were roasted alive before people of the area or the 
fire brigade and district administration could do anything.
  
Charred bodies could be seen in the burnt-out hulk of the bus. Many of 
them were perched on the seats they had occupied. A number bodies were 
found near the door of the bus indicating that the passengers had made a 
desperate attempt to escape the inferno.
  
Some of the charred bodies of women could be identified by the jewellery 
they had on. Except for damaged wrist watches, pieces of jewellery and 
burnt household items, there was nothing to identify the dead. Nine of 
the victims were women and five children. The odour of burnt-out bodies 
had fouled the atmosphere.
  
The area people blamed the absence of fire brigade unit in the town and 
the two-hour late arrival of fire tenders from other cities for the 
increased number of casualties.
  
A police constable, Khan Muhammad, who was among the injured, said he 
had been deputed to clear the traffic for the chief ministers 
motorcade. He had just asked the driver to move his bus and had gone 
towards its rear when the bomb exploded.
  
He said he found blood oozing out of his face and his shoulder and when 
he looked at the bus, he found it engulfed in a cloud of smoke. Soon, a 
big fire broke out and I ran to save my life, terrified and confused.
  
A young girl Mussarat of Head Balloki was among the lucky survivors who 
remained unhurt. The weeping girl said she was travelling with her two 
brothers. She was able to speak only when she came to know that they 
were alive. She said she was standing near the door of the bus and was 
thrown out by the impact of the explosion.
  
Sarwar of Arifwala, who suffered minor injuries said he was sitting near 
the door of the bus when the bomb exploded.
  
Another passenger, Murad Ali of Okara, said he was sitting on a seat 
behind the driver. Initially he could not understand what had happened. 
But later found the bus and the passengers burning. As he saw some 
burning women struggling to come out he jumped from a window. I dont 
know what happened to the women, he said.
  
A chemist who provided first-aid to some of the injured said he saw the 
bus burning after he came out of his shop on hearing the explosion. The 
fire brigade reached there after over two hours and in the meantime 
people made desperate efforts to extinguish the fire.
  
Muhammad Sadiq, a soft drink seller said the area police were present on 
the spot but did not dare go near the bus. The fire died down itself 
after it had consumed the passengers and the bus.
  
Rescue operations were supervised by the administration. Bomb disposal 
squads of the Pakistan Army and civil defence were called in.
  
The debris from the explosion was taken away by the experts, who said 
they could not immediately comment on the nature of the explosive device 
used.

<a name="imra">Imran Khan launches Movement for Justice</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
    
LAHORE, April 25: Expressing his disappointment with the failure of the 
political system and of politicians to solve public problems and lack of 
commitment on their part to give the people their rights, former cricket 
star Imran Khan on Thursday launched his Tehrik-i-Insaaf (Movement for 
Justice) to bring about a change within the framework of the 
Constitution.
    
At a news conference, Mr Khan highlighted the problems which his 
movement would address, and singled out corruption as a major focus of 
attention. He alleged that it was because of corruption that foreign 
investment was not coming into Pakistan.
    
He said eight committees would be constituted to prepare recommendations 
for a change in the current terrible state of affairs in judicial and 
legal affairs, human rights, governance, health and education, economy, 
youth affairs and joblessness, women affairs and environment.
    
Mr Khan said every citizen was free to join the movement, but the 
leaders to be inducted in the proposed committees would have to be men 
of proven integrity and with an unblemished character.
    
He set no time-frame for the establishment of these committees or how 
long he could take to bring about a desired change in the country.
    
When it was pointed out that a change would not be possible unless he 
formed his own political party, he said his movement was the first step 
towards the formation of a party. He believed that the people would 
trust and support him. Even the Quaid-i-Azam, he pointed out, was an 
individual but he got popular support only because the people trusted 
him and his integrity.

<a name="indi">Indian agencies manipulated MQM team at Geneva</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 27: Senator Iqbal Haider claimed that Indian intelligence 
agencies had manipulated the MQM delegation at the 52nd session of the 
Human Rights Commission in Geneva to malign Pakistan and to downplay 
atrocities being committed by its troops in the occupied Kashmir.
    
Addressing a joint Press conference with the Sindh Chief Ministers 
advisor on Information Mohammad Yusuf, Senator Haider, who led 
Pakistans delegation at the conference, said: We not only countered 
their moves successfully by exposing terrorist activities of the Altaf 
Group and killing of innocent people in Pakistan but also drew world 
attention to Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir where thousands of 
people have been killed.
    
He said the propaganda by the MQM delegates against the state of 
Pakistan could not impress the members of the UNHRC as we provided 
evidence of the killing of innocent citizens of Pakistan, including 
Urdu-speaking community whom they claim to represent.
    
He said that none of the political parties in Pakistan, except the Altaf 
group, ever used international forum to defame Pakistan. He said that 
such a thing had made it clear that the Altaf Group wanted to strengthen 
the aims and designs of India.
    
He said that no political party or group has harmed the interests of the 
Urdu-speaking people as had been done by Altaf Hussain since 1985.

He said the delegation apprised the Commission, comprising 53 member-
states, of the struggle for the right to self-determination launched by 
the people of Kashmir and the atrocities unleashed by the Indian 
occupation forces in the held valley.
    
Senator Haider did not agree with journalists who were of the view that 
the governments inability to table a resolution on Kashmir in Geneva 
was a setback and a failure of the foreign policy initiative.

<a name="facc">FACC unearths : IT secret fund misappropriation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, April 27: Some officials of the Income Tax Department are 
alleged to have misappropriated the entire secret fund of one million 
rupees, informed sources claimed that the parent organisation, the 
Central Board of Revenue (CBR) was trying to hush up the matter.
    
The secret fund is used by the department to make payments to informers 
for obtaining information on tax evasions. According to official 
sources, one million rupees were placed at the disposal of the director 
general (investigation), Lahore.
    
But since no cases were assigned for special investigation, the money 
was not spent. The sources said when a CBR official, Farooq A. Malik, 
was transferred from the CBR as director general of IT (Investigation), 
Lahore, the money was withdrawn from the bank. They said when the issue 
was brought to the notice of the Prime Minister, she asked the Federal 
Anti-Corruption Committee to hold an inquiry and pinpoint the officials 
involved.
    
The sources said when the FACC inquiry officer asked the CBR chairman 
about reports of misappropriation, he was informed that the money had 
not been misappropriated but was still lying with the bank.
    
However, the FACC wrote at least four letters to the CBR chairman in 
January and February, asking him to provide the attested copy of the 
bank statement up to Dec. 31, 1995, but got no positive response. The 
FACC then used its own channels to get the information and obtained 
documentary evidence showing that there was nil balance in the secret 
fund account in June 1995.
    
Based on its investigations, the FACC sub-committee held Farooq A. 
Malik, director general (Inspection, Audit and Investigation), 
responsible for the breach of trust of public funds.

<a name="reco">FACC recommends transfer of Emigration Bureau officials</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 28: The Federal Anti Corruption Committee (FACC) headed 
by Senator Malik Mohammad Qasim has advised the government to consider 
mass-scale transfer of all officers who have been serving the Bureau of 
Emigration and Protectors of Emigrant for quite long to some other 
departments.
  
The recommendation has been made in a report given recently to the Prime 
Minister by the FACC chief after a detailed investigation was made into 
repatriation of 32 Pakistani workers by the Dubai authorities on 
February 27. Dubai authorities had charged that these workers were 
travelling on forged documents. The Prime Ministers Secretariat 
instructed the FACC to carry out investigation into this affair.
  
During the investigation, the FACC noted that almost every officer in 
Bureau of Emigration and Overseas Employment is not subjected to normal 
transfers under the rules, as is the case with other officials of 
bureaucracy, since there is no reason to provide this relaxation, the 
report suggested to the Secretary Establishment Division to consider 
enforcement of normal postings and transfer practice in these offices 
also.
  
Following a detailed investigation by the member FACC Mr Ali Ashraf 
Khan, the Committee Chief Senator Malik Mohammad Qasim in his report to 
the Prime Minister has blamed the Protector of Emigrant at Lahore and 
Counsellor Welfare in Pakistans Consulate General in Dubai for being 
equally responsible in the case and has recommended that these officials 
be immediately relieved from their present posts and that departmental 
enquiries be instituted against them.

<a name="pmwo">PM worried over Indian N-plan but sees no war</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, May 1: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has ruled out an open 
conflict with India but warned that the continuation of Indian nuclear 
programme would have terrible consequences for the subcontinent.

In an interview with CNN, she said Pakistan and India have though fought 
three wars, both the countries have, however, avoided an outright armed 
confrontation since 1972. Some say it is because of the political 
understanding, others say its because of the unspoken nuclear parity, 
she said adding so I do not see an open conflict breaking up between 
India and Pakistan, but I do see skirmishes.
    
Recalling a recent rocket attack on Forward Kahuta Benazir Bhutto feared 
there would, however, be an increase in tension unless efforts are taken 
to diffuse the situation.
    
When asked what would be the outcome of the on-going elections in India, 
Benazir believed that India would have a split mandate and there would 
be a week coalition government. I am concerned as to whether the 
coalition government will be able to take the bold decisions that are 
necessary to begin talking to Pakistan about Kashmir.
    
She said it really did not matter which political party forms the Indian 
government. Most of the parties have the same view towards Kashmir that 
is to send in the Indian troops and solve the problem, but thats no 
solution.
    
She said she was concerned because this (Kashmir) dispute has led to 
the development of a missile programmes, and people are living in an 
area which seems out of synchronisation with the rest of the world.
    
Answering a question Benazir Bhutto said that by holding a sham election 
in occupied Kashmir, India was deceiving the world and this was going to 
add fuel to fire.
    
She said the mock elections in occupied Kashmir will show India that the 
Kashmir problem is not going to go away. The people of Jammu and Kashmir 
never wanted to be a part of India and they want a plebiscite to 
determine their own future, and live in freedom, she added.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, May 1: Pakistan is undertaking production of a new anti-tank 
guided missile for its army, capable of hitting targets upto 3,000 
meters.
    
The missile has a maximum range of 3,000 m with a hit probability of 90 
percent claimed. The single high explosive anti-tank warhead will 
penetrate 800 mm of armour with average flight speed being 220 m/sec, 
Janes weekly said.
    
Giving its technical details, the weekly said guidance of the missile is 
semi-automatic command-to-line of sight. To obtain a hit, the operator 
has to keep the sight on the target. 
   
Britains Devonport Management recently received a US$ 530,000 contract 
to assist in integrating the command system, which suggests the 
programme will begin later this year.

Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 26: A 22-year-old married woman whose husband was 
allegedly forced to divorce her at gunpoint by her father, refused to 
return to her parents home, even though her father, Hafiz Abdul Waheed 
Ropri, and the Lahore High Court (LHC) Bar Association president Dr 
Khalid Ranjha tried to arrange an out of court deal.
    
Saima has been ordered by the Lahore High Court to be kept at Dastak 
under the supervision and control of Dr Ranjha. Dastak is a womens home 
run by the AGHS Legal Aid Society.
    
Sources close to the family told Dawn that Saima Waheed, who stated she 
lawfully married Arshad Ahmed, refused to return to her parents or any 
of her relatives for fear of her and her husbands life. The source said 
she married against her fathers wish.
    
In an 45-minute meeting with her father, she made it clear that she 
will not accept anything less than a reunion with her husband who was 
forced at gunpoint to divorce her, said the family sources.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="sale">Sale of UBL to Saudi firm still uncertain</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, April 26: The fate of the Rs 585 million deal of the 
Privatisation Commission with Saudi Basharahil for the sale of 26 
percent management in the United Bank Limited (UBL) is still seemingly 
uncertain as the former is not satisfied with the financial position of 
the latter.
    
The documents provided by the group about its business and directors is 
still being scrutinised closely, a top official at the Commission told 
Dawn.

The credentials of the Saudi Company became ambiguous when the 
commission received the first instalment down payment through a 
Hyderabad Branch of Muslim Commercial Bank which established 
Basharahils links with a Sindh businessman, the source said.
    
On enquiry the buyer said due some problems with the transfer of 
resources from outside the country within the time limit allowed, the 
down payment had to be arranged from inside the country, and therefore 
the MCB cheque from the Sindhi businessman who it was claimed was one of 
directors of the company.
    
However, the Commissions disquiet increased substantially when the 
cheque for the second instalment also came through the same MCB branch 
made out by the same businessman from Sindh, the source added. Now the 
Commission is trying to make the sale and purchase agreement more 
stringent to ensure that the Saudi firm after taking over management 
control would inject the required resources in the bank to make it a 
profitable concern, the source said.
    
The Saudi firm had earlier given an undertaking to the Commission that 
it would inject 500 million dollars to turn the bank around.

<a name="sbpo">SBP order effective for two years</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, April 25: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) move to replace the 
previous Board of Directors of United Bank of Ltd is effective for two 
years that means that the SBP take-over of the bank is for the same 
period.
    
The April 20 order of the SBP governor had superseded the former UBL 
board of directors for two years, a defunct director of the board 
confided to Dawn.
    
I order that the Board of Directors of the bank be superseded for a 
period of two years from the date hereof subject to modifications that 
may be made in accordance with law and without prejudice to such other 
actions that may be taken under the law, says the order copies of which 
have been supplied to the removed chief executive and defunct directors 
of the UBL.
    
The SBP governor has also sent letters to the defunct chief executive 
and directors of UBL to make representation against his order by May 5.

On April 20, the SBP chief had issued an order under section 41-A and 
41-B of the Banking Companies Ordinance of 1962 to replace the top 
management of UBL.

The order said the former UBL President Khalid A. Sherwani was removed 
from the post of chief executive and the board of directors was 
superseded in the public interest and to secure the proper management 
of the bank. The order  a copy of which is available with Dawn  had 
made it clear that the chief executive and the board of directors would 
be given  a reasonable opportunity of making a representation, if any, 
to the State Bank against the order. It had further clarified that Mr 
Sherwani was removed from the presidency of UBL and the board of 
directors was superseded from April 20 pending consideration of the 
representation, if any...

Sources at UBL said the erstwhile board of directors was made up of 
seven members including Mr Sherwani  the only UBL employee among all of 
them  and a representative of Ministry of Finance Mr. Mohammad Iqbal 
Malik. The remaining five were all from the private sector and their 
appointments as directors of UBL was largely seen as political 
nominations. It is yet to be seen whether any of them decides to make a 
representation against the SBP order but sources privy to the UBL fiasco 
say hardly one or two of them can do so because such representations 
have to be substantiated on sound legal grounds that most of the former 
directors might be lacking.

Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, May 1: The Chairman of Pakistan Environmental Protection 
Council, Asif Ali Zardari, offered to serve as a bridge between the 
business community and the government to sort out all issues that may be 
hindering trade and industrial activities.
    
He also suggested to them to form small committees with the government 
to sort out all outstanding issues and problems which they consider are 
obstructing trade and industrial activities.

I am ready to act as a bridge between you and the government, Mr 
Zardari told a luncheon meeting of the about 200 businessmen clustered 
in the corridor of Sindh Governors House where he announced the 
appointment of the former President of the Federation of Pakistan 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, S.M. Muneer, as Chairman of Pakistan 
Trade Fair Corporation, with immediate effect and till further orders.

Done, was the prompt reply from Asif Zardari in response to a 
suggestion of former FPCCI Chief Mr Tariq Sayeed to give representation 
to the private sector on Privatisation Commission. The only condition 
for such a nomination, he said was that businessman should be known 
internationally.
    
He also agreed to have a businessman as the Chairman of Export 
Processing Zone Authority and apparently consented that structure of the 
Board of Investment needed a fresh look to provide room for 
representation of private sector on it.

More than three hours discussion in hot and humid corridor of the 
Governors House was more of a brain storming session in which more than 
a dozen businessmen spoke at length on the issues that included the levy 
of general sales tax on an expanded level in the coming budget, 
implications on investment plans of some investors of the abrupt 
withdrawal of specialised industrialised zones (SIZ) scheme, rebate 
refund, role of pre-shipment companies and necessity of involving 
businessmen in crucial decision making. There were complaints of non-
implementation of the decisions taken in the previous meetings and non-
compliance of the policies framed to boost exports and invest. However, 
none spoke on the environmental related issues or bringing 
agriculturists income into tax net.	

Money making is the best pursuit in life, the husband of Prime 
Minister remarked while sharing governments changed perception on trade 
and industry with the businessmen to stress the point that the 
government now considers promotion of investment and trading activities 
sine qua non for the countrys progress and development.
    
He repeatedly stressed upon the businessmen to consider government as 
their partner in their trade and industrial pursuits and should cease to 
be hostile as was in the past.

Mr Zardari also emphasised the need to bring an end of discrimination 
between the urban and rural people. Both live in Pakistan and they 
supplement and complement each other in economic progress, he said.
    
He indicated that government would hold pre-budget meetings with the 
businessmen and that your views would serve as inputs for the budget 
makers, he assured.

Speaking on the current economic situation, the PPP Member of National 
Assembly from Nawabshah said that he considers countrys current export 
earning capacity of 9 billion dollars as mere peanuts when looked in 
context of the available potential. Our foreign exchange reserves are 
too meagre, he said and expressed the view that export earnings and 
foreign exchange reserves can be increased manifold if both government 
and businessmen pool their talent and resources.

His assertion was that 125 million population was an asset of the 
country rather than a liability as some international agencies try to 
create impression. He termed Pakistans geographical location at 
immediate proximity of Central Asian Republics as the greatest economic 
advantage which has yet to be fully exploited.
    
Referring to some businessmens observations on conditionalities of the 
International Monetary Fund, Mr Zardari reminded them that IMF was 
facilitation agency and has a responsibility to ensure that budgetary 
expenditure, inflation and other conditions remains under control.

He said that 5 billion dollars are being invested in the power projects 
to ensure that electricity reaches all part of the country and 
particularly in the remote rural areas where he said people still live 
in primitive conditions.

<a name="stuc">Stuck-up loans swell to Rs 108bn</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, April 27: The total stuck-up loans of banks and Development 
Finance Institutions (DFIs) rose from Rs 103.039 billion to Rs 107.836 
billion by end December last year.
    
Sources close to State Bank of Pakistan told Dawn domestic banks had 
the largest share of 82.8 percent in the total infected loan portfolio 
followed by DFIs  13.9 percent  and foreign banks  3.3 percent. By 
December 31 the total stuck-up loans of DFIs totalled Rs 14.933 billion 
and that of foreign banks Rs 3.565 billion.
    
A comparative study shows that by end September last year stuck-up loans 
of domestic banks totalled Rs 85.510 billion or 83.0 percent of the 
total infected loan portfolio. The DFIs and foreign banks had reported 
total stuck-up loans of Rs 14.5 billion and Rs 3.029 billion 
respectively constituting 14.1 percent and 2.9 percent of infected 
portfolio.
    
Sources in the banking industry link the accumulation of huge stuck-up 
loans to four main factors (i) political interference in financial 
institutions (ii) inefficient bank managements and imprudent lending 
policies and (iii) lack of accountability of bankers responsible for 
piling up of stuck-up loans and (iv) absence of effective legal 
framework for quick disposal of cases in litigation.
    
Lately the SBP has taken strong exception of the expansion of infected 
loan portfolio and has instructed banks and DFIs to contain it without 
loss of time. Only this week, the SBP Governor again urged all banks and 
DFIs to contain expansion of bad loans and asked them to draw specific 
plans for this purpose.
    
Three NCBs and four state-run DFIs are busy making such plans that they 
are supposed to submit to the SBP by May 12. Senior executives of NCBs 
and DFIs say implementation of the plans they are making would not be an 
easy task. Not that we do not know how to contain bad loans. The 
problem is with implementation of the plans, the chief executive of a 
DFI told Dawn.
   
He said any move to contain bad loans needs to be strengthened by (i) an 
all out SBP support to banks and DFIs in implementation of their 
policies (ii) non-interference of government in banking affairs and 
(iii) co-operative attitude of the trade and industry in the process.

<a name="heav">Heavy buying in energy scrips: index up 34 points</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, April 25: Stocks were back on the rails, boosted by heavy 
buying in the energy shares followed by press reports of an imminent 
tariff hike. Index soared by over 34 points.
    
The market also continued to derive strength from the aid pledge of $2.4 
billion by the donor countries for Pakistans next years development 
programmes.
    
The fast changing world view about the growth potential of Pakistan has 
created a new buying enthusiasm in the rings and it might not be without 
some positive indicators, said a leading analyst but hastened to say 
it is too early to pass judgement on the direction of the market at this 
stage.
    
The KSE 100-share index soared 34.39 points to 1,590.68 as compared to 
1,556.29 a day earlier but unluckily could not attain its current 
psychological barrier of 1,600 on which a solid rally could be built-up.
    
After several lean weeks, the index managed to recover 70 points over 
the week, which is said to be good performance, pointing to the possible 
advent of a bull market during post-Eid holidays trading week.
    
A 70 points gain in index means an addition of Rs 10.5 billion in the 
market capitalisation, which reflects the markets urge to rise to its 
pre-reaction levels, analysts said.
    
But most floor brokers believe the direction of the market will be clear 
in the post-Eid holiday sessions as by that time investors will have 
fully analysed the current developments on the economic front.
    
Although buying interest spread to some more sectors but by and large it 
remained selective as a section of leading operators was not inclined to 
move out of the safe havens.
    
However, it was for the first time after several weeks that gainers 
managed to force a strong lead over the losers, indicating that the 
current tempo of recovery could be sustained in the post-Eid holiday 
sessions too.
    
PSO and Lever Brothers led the list of leading gainers, rising by Rs 5 
to 6 and they were closely followed by some other leading shares, 
notably Fauji fertiliser and Berger Paints, which rose by Rs 2.
    
But sudden burst into activity of Kohinoor Energy on strong buying at 
the lower levels was days feature as it not only showed a good gain of 
Rs 2.15 but also actively traded, accounting for 1.777m shares.
    
Other leading shares, which managed to show good recoveries were led by 
Askari Bank, Bankers Equity, Faysal bank, Dewan Salman, Essa and Fecto 
Cement and KESC, which posted gains ranging from one rupee to Rs 1.75.
    
Dawood Hercules, which surged by Rs 20 over the last two sessions came 
in for active selling at the higher levels and was marked down by Rs 6.
    
It was followed by Pakistan Oilfields, which suffered a decline of Rs 3, 
losing well over 15 over the week. Shell Pakistan, Pakistan Gum, Sandoz 
Pakistan, Hoechst Pakistan and SK&F were leading losers among the MNCs, 
falling by one rupee each.
    
Among the local losers, Javed Omer, Dadabhoy Insurance, Dewan Textiles, 
Gulistan Textiles and Dilon were prominent.
    
Hub-Power maintained its upward thrust on heavy speculative buying and 
led the list of most actives, up Rs 1.90 on 14.840m shares followed by 
PTC vouchers, higher Rs 1.40 on 11.470m shares, Kohinoor Energy, firm Rs 
2.15 on 1,777m shares, D.G.Khan Cement (r), unchanged on 0.529m shares, 
Lucky Cement, steady 15 paisa on 0.455m shares, and Fauji Fertiliser, 
higher Rs 2.60 on 0.337m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Dhan Fibre, unchanged on 0.234m 
shares, D.G.Khan Cement, up 75 paisa on 0.220m shares, PICIC, higher 80 
paisa on 0.122m shares and Pakistan Synthetics, firm 25 paisa on 0.155m 
shares.
    
Trading volume rose to 33.617m shares from the previous 30m shares 
thanks to larger activity in the pivotals.
    
There were 292 actives, out of which 135 shares rose, while 88 fell, 
with 69 holding on to the last levels.

T<a name="thej">he judiciary triumphs-IV</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

THIS time, Editor, you really have led. On April 19 your leader, Time 
to put this spectacle behind us, opened up:
    
The spectacle to which the nation has been treated following the 
verdict in the Judges Case has not been an edifying one. An entire tribe 
of commentators has felt free to pass opinions on it, in the process 
subjecting the higher judiciary to the kind of attention that, left to 
itself, it will probably not seek in the next hundred years...
    
Those motivated (by whatever or whoever) to speak or write supporting 
the executive exposed themselves and made a fool of those on whose 
behalf they wrote. Some (as said Paine of Burke) rose like a rocket and 
fell like a stick.
    
Were Benazir to digest the words of Advocate Qaim Ali Shah, she would 
have the former commuter consigned to Outer Mongolia. In The Friday 
Times of April 11, Qaim stated that the Prime Minister was inclined to 
appoint Mr Justice Saad Saud Jan, the senior-most judge of the Supreme 
Court as Chief Justice. However, partymen Qaim, Abdullah Shah and 
Mirani pleaded for Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, and she gave in to them. 
Hardly likely, would not one say?
    
Sabhiuddin Ahmed, our human rights lawyer, suggested in The Herald that 
the conflict was not between the executive and the judiciary but merely 
an attempt by the executive to wield a feudal stick, keep the judiciary 
dependent, and control the courts. For all our sakes, we must be glad 
that the feudal stick, as far as our courts are concerned, has been 
neutralised and the people are not at the mercy of the Prime Ministers 
Secretariat.
    
The short order was announced in the Supreme Court on March 20. What was 
ordered to be done has been done. All four provincial High Courts are 
now presided over by permanent Chief Justices  Sindh, Justice Mamoon 
Kazi; Punjab, Justice Khalilur Rahman; NWFP, Justice Ibne Ali; 
Balochistan, Munawar Mirza.
    
Apparently, the Chief Justice of Pakistan had satisfactory discussions 
with the President and the turf has, for the time being, somewhat 
settled. Here I deviate. The draftsmen of constitutional law using the 
world discussion must remember how the people of the subcontinent tend 
to talk at each other rather than to each other. I quote from James 
Camerons An Indian Summer: I cannot remember ever hearing between 
Indians (read Pakistan) what would pass elsewhere for dialogue. The 
Indian (Pakistan) genius is for rhetoric, not repartee, for assertion, 
not discussion. Perhaps this explains in some degree the morbid 
sterility of their politics. A professional politician in India 
(Pakistan) does not change his mind; he changes his Party. He shifts 
one area of monologue for another.
    
I am a great believer in genealogy, that a man consciously or 
unconsciously emulates his forebears. A cattle rustlers son, even if 
sent to Oxford, may on the off-chance widen his knowledge and end up 
being a camel rustler.
    
Now for three judges most concerned with the people of Sindh.
    
The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sajjad Ali Shah, was born on February 17, 
1933, in the home of his father Syed Roshan Ali Shah, in Lyari, Karachi. 
Roshan Ali rose to be Deputy Registrar of the Sindh High Court (often 
acting as Registrar). His knowledge and acumen were respected by the 
judges and he was responsible for ensuring that many a suffering 
litigant appeared in time before the right court to receive justice. His 
kindliness was legendary and when he died, years after his retirement, 
hundreds of Sindhs citizens (I one of them) walked behind his bier.
    
Justice Shah went to the Sindh Madressa-tul-Islam, to the Sindh Muslim 
College, then to London to read law. He was called to the Bar in 1959 
from Lincolns Inn (where in 1995 he was honoured and appointed an 
Honorary Bencher). In 1960 he enrolled as an advocate of the Sindh High 
Court. In 1963 he was appointed the Lasbela District Public Prosecutor, 
and from 1967 to 1974 served as District and Sessions Judge in various 
districts of Punjab and Sindh. In 1974 he was posted as Joint Secretary 
in the Federal Law Ministry where he remained till 1977 when appointed 
Registrar of the Supreme Court.
    
He was elevated to the Bench of the Sindh High Court in 1978, took over 
as permanent Chief Justice in November 1989, in November 1990 was 
appointed to the Supreme Court, and in June 1994 became Chief Justice of 
Pakistan.
    
Noted for his integrity and the courage of his convictions, as we know, 
he is capable of dissent, even of being a sole dissenter as he was in 
the Nawaz government dissolution case.
    
Nasir Aslam Zahid is the son of Zahid Hussain, a man with a string of 
firsts to his name. A Vice-Chancellor of Aligarh University, he became 
Pakistans first High Commissioner in India, the first Governor of our 
State Bank, the first Chairman of the Planning Commission and the author 
of our first five-year plan. He died in 1957.
    
His son, Nasir, was born on February 3, 1935, matriculated from 
Karachis St Patricks High School, did his BA at Government College, 
Lahore and went on to Cambridge (Fitzwilliam House) to read law and gain 
an Honours Degree. In 1956 he was called to the Bar from the Middle 
Temple.
    
Barrister Zahid enrolled as an advocate of the Sindh High Court in 1957, 
and of the Supreme Court in 1962. He was elevated to the Bench of the 
SHC as an Additional Judge in 1980, and in 1983 was made a permanent 
judge. The second of the PPP governments temporarily removed him from 
the Bench in 1988 to send him off on deputation as the federal law 
secretary, a post he held until June 1990 when he returned to the SHC. 
>From January 1991 to the end of April of that year he moved to the 
Supreme Court as an ad hoc Judge. He had several spells acting as Chief 
Justice of Sindh, during the absence of the sitting Chief Justice, and 
in May 1992 took over as permanent Chief Justice.
    
By 1994, Justice Zahids independence could be tolerated no more by the 
harsh law enforcement agencies, backed by the executive. A relief-giving 
judge, he afforded no quarter to the agencies or the government 
prosecuting authorities. He had to be punished. The only way to do this 
was to move him to the Federal Shariat Court. This the government did, 
on April 16 of that year, without his consent, for a period of two 
years. A tribute to the man. By right and according to the Supreme Court 
judgement of March 20, in April of this year he should have returned to 
the SHC to resume the chief justiceship. But, for reasons which cannot 
be gone into here, he was instead elevated as a permanent judge of the 
Supreme Court. Sindhs loss. However, he should now be able to continue 
his contribution towards the dispensing of justice to the people of 
Pakistan up to the year 2000.
    
Justice Mamoon Kazi, now our Chief Justice in Sindh, hails from a 
distinguished family of jurists, the Kazis of Sindh. To start with, 
Barrister Allama Imdad Ali Kazi, called to the Bar from Lincolns Inn. 
Recognised as a sage of Sindh, he became the first Vice-Chancellor of 
the University of Sindh. then, judges of the High Court, Mohammed Hayat 
Junejo, Mushtaq Ali Kazi, Bashir Ghulam Nabi Kazi, Imam Ali Kazi, and 
Akhtar Ali Kazi. The last mentioned still holds the record for being the 
only sitting chief minister of Sindh who lost an election.
    
Abdul Rasool Kazi, Justice Mamoon Kazis father, was the Chief Judge of 
the Karachi Small Causes Court. In the 50s he succeeded the last 
Britisher, Tobin, as the powerful City Magistrate of our city. Later he 
became an Additional District Judge, then Solicitor and Deputy Secretary 
of the Federal Law Ministry under Law Secretary, Sir Edward Snellson. He 
retired as Joint Secretary of the Ministry.
    
Justice Kazi was born on December 30, 1935, at Karachi. He read law and 
practised his profession until appointed a member of the National 
Industrial Relations Commission in 1973, from where he resigned as 
Chairman in 1978, and continued his practice. In 1985 he was appointed 
Additional Judge of the Sindh High Court and confirmed in 1988. In 1995, 
he went to the Supreme Court as an ad hoc Judge and returned to Karachi 
on April 13 to take his oath as Chief Justice of the SHC.
    
Known also as a relief-giving judge, he is now bound to be more 
considerate knowing the state of the prisons of this province, 
overflowing with political prisoners who have never even seen the door 
of a court. He started well, with Justice Dr Ghous Mohammed sitting with 
him, dealing with all the stacked up kachcha peshis. He has the capacity 
to be as effective as his predecessor, Justice Zahid. We trust he has 
the will.

<a name="alea">A leader with a vision</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Professor Sharif al Mujahid

SETH Abdullah Haroon, whom the nation remembers today on his death 
anniversary was a successful business magnate, an entrepreneur, a 
committee man, an organiser, a philanthropist, founder of several 
educational, religious and social institutions, and a leader of 
outstanding merit.
    
Once he had established himself in business and attended to social 
causes calling for immediate attention, he was drawn to politics. In 
this case as well, his motive was the uplift of the poor, backward 
masses. This cause led him to take up, for instance, the cause of the 
separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency. At the Muslim League session 
at Aligarh (1925), he demanded a resolution on Sindhs separation; at 
the Leaders Conference at Delhi (1926), he put in a resolution on the 
issue; and from 1928 onwards, he argued against the financial solvency 
requirement for the separation of Sindh, stipulated in the Nehru Report 
(1928). He served as Secretary, Sindh Financial Inquiry Committee (1930-
35); he was a member of the Sindh Administrative Committee (1933) and 
Sindh Delimitation Committee (1935); he also chaired the Reception 
Commit-tee of the second session of the Sindh Azad Conference (1934), an 
organisation set up to counter the continuing Hindu propaganda and 
pressure against setting up Sindh as an autonomous province.
    
Of all the Muslim leaders of Sindh, he was the foremost to make an 
impact on the all-India mainstream politics; (Bhurgri was, of course, in 
All-India politics before him, but he died rather prematurely, in 1924). 
Haroons debut in all-India politics came in 1917 when he joined the 
Congress. From 1918, he was closely associated with the Khilafat 
movement. He was President of the Sindh Provincial Khilafat Committee 
for five years (1919-24); he made his house available as a centre for 
Khilafat activities, and for visiting all-India Khilafat leaders, 
including Maulana Mohammed Ali; he contributed generously to Khilafat 
coffers. And in recognition of his services, he was elected President of 
the All-India Central Khilafat Committee in 1928.
    
The 1920s also witnessed his entry into electoral politics and all-India 
mainstream Muslim politics. In 1923 he contested and won a seat in the 
Bombay Legislative Council, and in 1926 in the Indian Legislative 
Assembly, which he retained till his death in 1942. In 1920, he was 
elected President of the Provincial Muslim League, and from 1925 onwards 
he was active in All-India Muslim League. Beginning with 1929, he was 
also prominent in the All- India Muslim Conference which was set up as 
an umbrella organisation to counter the Nehru Report; he became its 
Secretary, and later President in 1935. All through these years he 
worked strenuously for its amalgamation with the All-Indian Muslim 
League, with a view to bringing about solidarity in Muslim ranks.
    
The most remarkable thing about Abdullah Haroon was that he had the 
vision and the imagination to see the problems of Sindhi Muslims in an 
all-India context and to establish linkages between the Sindhi component 
and the pan-Indian Muslim community, the only other Sindhi leader who 
shared this honour with him was Sheikh Abdul Majid who participated in 
the Cawnpore Mosque Agitation (1913), and the Khilafat movement, who was 
presumably inspired by the Cawnpore affair in taking a leading part in 
the Manzilgha Mosque agitation (1939), and who launched Al- Wahid (1920) 
on the pattern of Abul Kalam Azads Al- Hilal. Not only in the 
provincial context but also in the regional context, Abdullah Haroons 
impact on all-India politics was impressive.
    
Indeed, in the region now constituting Pakistan, his contacts with all-
India leaders and his involvement with all-India Muslim politics were 
only next to Mian Muhammad Shafi (d. 1931), who was involved in Muslim 
politics since the days of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan. Abdullah Haroon was 
President of at least six all-India conferences and bodies  All-India. 
Central Khilafat Committee (1928), All India Tanzim Conference, 
Allahabad (1930); All-India Postal and RMS Union (1931); All India Memon 
conference (1935); All-India Muslim Conference (1935), and All-India 
Seerat conference, Allahabad (1942).
    
His role in the Muslim League from 1937 onwards, however, surpassed 
everything else he did in his entire political career. In that year, he 
undertook the task of organising the League in the province. In 1938, he 
organised the First Sind Provincial Muslim League Conference at Karachi, 
with himself as Chairman, Reception Committee. In 1939, he was elected 
president of the Sindh Provincial Muslim League, and also became 
Chairman, All- India Muslim League (AIML) Foreign Sub-Committee; in 1940 
he was nominated member of the AIML Working Committee; in 1941 he 
presided over the Punjab Muslim Students Conference at Lyallpur; in the 
same year he secured the Manzilgah Mosque in Sukkur on behalf of the 
Muslim League as its president.
    
Among these, however, the First Provincial Muslim League Conference in 
October 1938 represented his most important contribution in channelling 
the course of Indo-Muslim politics. Though a provincial moot, it was not 
only presided over by Mohammad Ali Jinnah, but was participated in by a 
galaxy of Muslim leaders including the premiers of Bengal and the 
Punjab, Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan, Bahadur Yar Jung, Maulana Shaukat 
Ali, Begum Mohammed Ali, Raja of Mahmudabad, Raja of Pirpur, Maulana 
Jamal Mian of Farangi Mahal, Syed Ghulam Bhik Naraing, Maulana Abdul 
Hamid Badayuni and Mushtaq Ahmad Gurmani.
    
Nor were the topics discussed or the decisions taken confined to Sindh. 
Haroons welcome address set the tone for the conference: it was radical 
and militant; it commended an ideological goal. Unless adequate 
safeguards and protection for minorities were duly provided, declared 
Haroon, the Muslims would have no alternative but to seek their 
salvation in their own way in an independent federation of Muslim 
states. he drew a parallel with Czechoslovakia which had been 
partitioned to provide safeguards to Sudetan Germans, and warned that 
the same might happen in India should the majority community persist in 
its present course, saying, We have nearly arrived at the parting of 
the ways and until and unless this problem is solved to the satisfaction 
of all, it will be impossible to save India from being divided into 
Hindu India and Muslim India, both placed under separate federation.
    
This conjunction of interests of the Muslim majority and minority 
provinces represents a milestone in evolving a common goal for the 
entire Muslim community and towards enunciating the concept of Muslim 
nationhood. And the resolution argued the case of separate Muslim 
nationhood, not merely in terms of transient factors such as the 
castridden mentality and anti-Muslim policy of the majority community, 
but, more importantly, in terms of durable factors such as the acute 
differences of religion, language, script, culture, social laws and 
outlook on the life of the two major communities and even of race in 
certain parts. Thus, the concept of separate Muslim nationhood was 
spelled out not merely in political and immediate terms, but on an 
intellectual plane, spelling out the basics and bases of that 
nationhood. Equally significant, this was also the first time that the 
Hindus and Muslims were officially pronounced by the Muslim League as 
two distinct nations.
     
In the historical perspective, this resolution became the precursor of 
the Lahore Resolution of 1940.
     
In order to give a big push in that direction and to prepare the 
intelligentsia for the partition proposal, he got Dr Syed Abdul Latifs 
book on the Muslim Problem in India (1939) published and circulated. In 
his Foreword, he shunned the circumlocutory language of the Karachi 
resolution for a categorical enunciation of the still evolving Muslim 
goal:
   
To quote R. Coupland, who studied the constitutional problem in India in 
early 1940s, Abdullah Haroon was the only Muslim politician of any 
standing who had so far taken a public part in the constitutional 
discussion he was also clear in his mind as to the solution. Finally, 
the Sub-committee which he headed prepared a comprehensive report which 
became the basis of the Lahore Resolution.
    
In thus advancing the cause of a Muslim homeland at a critical stage, 
Abdullah Haroon carved for himself a niche as one of the founding 
fathers of Pakistan, although he did not live long enough to see his 
dream materialise in 1947.

<a name="habi">Habits assuming the force of history</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

THE following vignette is not apocryphal. It actually happened. When Mr 
Kunwar Idrees, the former senior bureaucrat, was waylaid recently (this 
being the second time that this misfortune was befalling him and his 
family) his daughter-in-law who was sitting with him in his BMW asked 
one of the dacoits who had seized them as to why he had taken to this 
profession. The answer was along the following lines: if everyone else 
was involved in looting the country what was wrong with him and his 
colleagues following the same example?
  
Then the dacoit asked Kunwar Idrees a question in return. Pointing his 
pistol at Kunwar Idreess head he asked him as to who was the biggest 
robber and dacoit in the country. Ever the cautious bureaucrat, Kunwar 
Idrees named some nondescript person. Incensed by what he thought was a 
dishonest answer, the dacoit looked menacingly at Kunwar Idrees and told 
him to speak the truth. At this Kunwar Idrees named someone else which 
further infuriated the dacoit who said he would blow his head off if he 
was not careful. Left with little choice, Kunwar Idrees, I am sure 
against his better bureaucratic instincts, took the name of the person  
how shall I put it?  about whom it could be said as Cassius said of 
Caesar: Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus... 
No sooner had he done this than the holdup man relaxed, flashed a 
knowing smile and lowered his gun.

While looking up this quote from Julius Caesar, I also came across those 
passages which speak of Brutuss jealous regard for his honour. What a 
contrast this presents with our own country. People in positions of 
authority and power think nothing of being known universally as crooks 
and blackguards as long as they can keep enjoying the fruits of 
prosperity. A regard for honour or a concern for ones reputation seems 
quaint and old-fangled notions. And well they might be because in other 
countries if you lampoon a person or turn him into an object of ridicule 
it has some effect. Here none at all. The notoriety of powerful 
individuals makes not the slightest difference to their social or 
political standing, so completely has the distinction or tameez between 
right and wrong disappeared from the Islamic Republic.
  
As I write this I am aware of the element of repetition in these 
complaints. Dont we all say how corrupt our society has become, how our 
values have become debased? Even so, the dhitai (obstinacy not really 
conveying the meaning of this Urdu word) of our better off classes does 
not cease to amaze.
  
Take sarkari pilgrimages to the Holy Land which certainly do not fall 
into the same league as highway robbery but which still indicate the 
contempt which the bonzes of the Republic have for public opinion. What 
criticism and even ridicule has this practice not invited? And yet the 
Prime Minister has just been on one of her endless umras at state 
expense and the President with an entourage in tow is even now in the 
Holy Land performing the haj for the umpteenth time.
  
It was the late Maulana Kausar Niazi who during General Zias lifetime 
wrote a scathing column in Jang in which, citing chapter and verse from 
the Quran, he pointed out that using public money, money that belonged 
to the people, in order to perform the haj or the umra was totally 
against the tenets or the spirit of Islam. Our present rulers let no 
opportunity go by without attacking General Zia and yet some aspects of 
his legacy they have taken to with surprising ease.
  
In any event, is it not pertinent to ask what our great ones take the 
Lord of the Universe to be? Do they consider Him to be a wayside 
mendicant or the mujawar of a shrine whose goodwill can be bought by 
making a gesture or two in his direction? They will not use their power 
or authority for the general good, nor will they refrain from doing what 
they should not, but they will present themselves at regular intervals 
at the Holy Kaaba or the Masjid-i-Nabvi (at the public expense) and 
there pray loud and long for the countrys prosperity (and, since they 
are mortal, perhaps also for their own longevity). They cannot be having 
a very high opinion of the Supreme Intelligence if they seek to mock it 
in this manner.
  
In any case, it is a very shabby understanding of Islam to think that 
the mere ability to be in the Holy Land gives one a licence to do 
anything at home. As my undoubtedly limited knowledge of Islam tells me, 
performing the umra or the haj is good insofar as it makes one a better 
person. One has been touched by the Divine Presence and one is the 
better for it. But to go to the Holy Land whenever it pleases someone 
just because he has the resources of the state at his command and this 
act of piety having not the slightest effect on his actions, is not much 
different from the Roman Church at its worst: doing what one pleases and 
then buying immunity from divine prosecution through the sale of 
indulgences.
  
But enough of this. There was a story in Sundays newspapers which has 
also served to shatter my composure. A Lahore industrialist, Shahid 
Sethi, who had been kidnapped some days back was recovered from a 
locality of the city after a massive police operation. This is something 
commendable. The police deserve praise and the affected family is 
entitled to everyones sympathy. But just consider what it took before 
this happy event could come to pass. The family of the kidnapped 
industrialist was influential enough to approach MNA Asif Ali Zardari 
(who seems to be everywhere from the environment to anything else that 
you can think of) and insist that a DIG of their choice (Salim Wahidi) 
be appointed to head the investigation. This was done and all the 
resources of the Lahore police were put at the disposal of Salim Wahidi. 
After tracing the source of the telephone calls that had been made to 
the family a dragnet was thrown around the suspected locality and a 
house-to-house search was conducted which eventually led to the recovery 
of Shahid Sethi.
  
Not for a moment am I suggesting that the Lahore police should not have 
shown the diligence that they did in this matter. If something happened 
to my son or to a daughter of mine I would try to move heaven and earth 
for them. But how many people can approach MNA Asif Ali Zardari and have 
a DIG of their choice appointed if they are the victims of a crime? 
Isnt it sad, therefore, that if the wheels of justice and of the 
criminal justice system move in this country they only do so if there is 
someone to push them from behind?
  
There are few examples from Islamic history which the devout of this 
land like to quote more often than that of the angry Bedouin who roughly 
asked the Caliph Omar as to how he had appropriated more cloth for his 
shirt from the Bait-ul-Maal than that falling to the share of others. We 
all know what Omar said: that since he was a tall man and his own share 
of the cloth would not have sufficed for his shirt, he had added to it 
the share of his son. How we love quoting this example and how we abhor 
the very thought of putting it into some form of practice.
  
Come to think of it, it is more a question of culture than of actual 
wrongdoing. When the columnist Masood Hasan, now sadly lost to the News, 
writes (invariably to scathing effect) of the way we eat at our marriage 
functions, of the traffic and noise in Lahore, of the inventive marvel 
of our airport trolleys (surely the likes of which are not to be seen at 
any other airport in the world), about the loutishness of our cricketing 
champions, and even of the tired and monotonous routine of our great 
singing maestros, what he serves to emphasise is a general decline in 
manners and a loss of anything remotely approaching good taste. We seem 
to have lost a sense of balance and propriety which is why our follies 
and the antics of our governing classes are becoming not so much more 
criminal as more egregious by the day.
  
But surely, someone will protest, this state of affairs is amenable to 
change and the gentle winds of reform. I wish this optimism could be 
more widely shared. As time passes we are getting more confirmed in our 
habits, with the result that the threshold of what is acceptable keeps 
rising. Insensibly but surely we are also reverting to some fixed 
patterns of our historical past. The lands which constitute Pakistan 
have in the past known just and orderly rule (and therefore a modicum of 
prosperity) not through the application of laws or the wholesome 
influence of durable institutions but through the rough justice flowing 
from the hands of strong rulers. For the last fifty years we have 
destroyed other institutions and raised monuments to greed and 
corruption. Now we await the arrival of a Strong Man. Other people may 
talk of the end of history. We are trying to go back to its beginnings.

<a name="coop">Co-operation, not bombs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Benazir Bhutto
    
LAST Sunday, more than 50 of my countrymen lost their lives in the cold-
blooded bombing of a bus returning from Eid-ul- Azha, one of the most 
important feasts in the Muslim calendar.
    
Women and children burned to death, and witnesses were unable to 
approach the shattered vehicle for hours because of the extreme heat. It 
was a senseless tragedy that leaves us wondering about the kind of world 
we live in.
    
Although we do not know the identity of those responsible for this 
heinous act, the preliminary findings indicate that it might have been 
from outside the country and externally sponsored. It may have been an 
effort by enemies of Pakistan to step up activity in the important 
province of Punjab.
    
The ultimate irony is that this comes at a time when all the nations of 
the world should be overcoming differences and learning to cooperage in 
the quest for peace and economic prosperity.
    
One only has to look as far as the European Union and ASEAN to see the 
potential benefits of this type of co-operation. But the success of 
regional alliances depends on the promotion of a common interest, mutual 
confidence and a spirit of equality among big and small neighbouring 
states  the type of brotherhood that can be so easily shattered by a 
terrorists explosives.
    
We must not let these potential dangers deter us from our attempts to 
build successful regional alliances, however. The economic well-being of 
our people is too important for such fears.</pre><hr><pre>

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD,  April 27: World number one Jansher  Khan subdued fellow 
countryman Zubair Jehan Khan, with a splendid exhibition of technique 
and stamina in straight games 15-10, 15-9, 15-10 to win the $10,000 
Pakistan International Squash at POF Wah Squash courts.
    
Facing fellow team-mate of World and Asian championships, it took 
Jansher just under 45 minutes to claim the final.
    
The world number one did not give Zubair Jehan any moment of relief in 
the first two games as Zubair put in his best effort. Ruthless Jansher 
after securing the opening two games at 15-10, 15-9 was rather 
complacent at the start of the third game as Zubair went three point up. 
But, Jansher came right back and won the game and the match at 15-10 to 
clinch the title.
    
About his triumph at Wah, Jansher said that he has improved his fitness 
with competitive practice before the bigger event in Cairo.

<a name="jaha">Jahangir for low-price squash circuit </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
A. Majid Khan

KARACHI, May 1: Former world squash champion Jahangir Khan, strongly 
urged holding a well-planned low prize money circuit of at least eight 
tournaments in Pakistan next year.
    
Talking to Dawn Jahangir Khan, stated that low-prized money tournaments 
would considerably help our talented players by competing both against 
the world ranked foreign players as well as against our own seasoned and 
experienced players of the world circuit.
    
The former mighty Khan urged the squash authorities of the country to 
work out a comprehensive annual calendar for next year during which no 
less than eight events, spreading between two sessions, be held 
depending on weather conditions of the country. Each tournament should 
be approved by the Professional Squash Association (PSA). The prize 
money for each event should be between US dollars 10,000 and 15,000 or 
more, he added.
    
The former world number one said it is good that four low prize money 
tournaments, two in Lahore, and one each at Peshawar and Wah, had been 
staged and a good number of foreign players competed in these events. 
However, the once great Khan opined that the Pakistan squash circuit 
first session of four tournaments should start either from Karachi or 
Peshawar and  be organised in such a way that players especially the 
foreign contestants, could play in each event one after the other.
    
Besides this international circuit, the number of the local tournaments 
should also be increased. Khan cited the example of Sami Elopuro of 
Finland who last year was among the top 12 players in the world as he 
honed his competitive skill by participating in low prized money 
tournaments before entering the PSA Super series. The low prize money 
events would provide an ideal opportunity to our players, especially the 
up-and-coming youth, to earn points as well as cash prize as these 
tournaments have a draw of 16 players, 12 reserved for PSA ranking 
players and four for qualifiers from the qualifying rounds.
    
The small tournaments, he further stated, are gaining popularity 
throughout the squash world. Though we have started late, nevertheless a 
beginning has been made for holding PSA opposed low prized tournaments 
and what we now need are more such tournaments.
    
Jahangir who is General Manager Sports, PIA, further suggested that 
annual PIA Open should be made an international event, if possible even 
this year.
    
About the women squash, the former world champion said for one reason or 
the other we have not given due attention to the promotion of the game 
among the girls, though they are fully capable of becoming players of 
international repute.
    
What we require is to provide proper training and coaching facilities 
for the girls under the guidance of coaches at different centres of the 
country. The standard of women squash would certainly improve with the 
passage of time provided we also provide the required competitions for 
them throughout the year. It is a challenging task and if the 
organisers, at all levels, sincerely commit themselves in raising the 
women squash standard, the objective can easily be achieved, he stated.
    
We have to work tremendously hard for maintaining Pakistan supremacy in 
international squash as the challenge is growing as all the world is 
after us to end the domination.

<a name="adau">A daunting task faces Tiwana for Olympic hockey title</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Walter Fernandez

KARACHI, April 25: Mr. Mohammad Nawaz Tiwana, Managing Director of 
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) on Wednesday was elected chief of 
the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) for the second time in place of Air 
Vice Marshal (Retd) Farooq Umar.
    
Mr. Tiwana had first served as the PHF supremo from April 1992 after Air 
Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan had resigned on being made the Chief of 
the Air Staff, and held that office until May 21, 1993, when Air Vice 
Marshal Farooq Umar was elected the PHF President.
    
The immediate task that stares Mr. Tiwana in the face is to try to 
regain the coveted Olympic hockey gold medal for the country at Atlanta 
in July-August this year. Pakistan, the reigning world hockey champions, 
had last won the hockey gold medal in 1984 Olympics at Los Angeles. But 
in the 1988 Seoul Games Pakistan had finished one from the bottom and in 
1992 at Barcelona Pakistan was able to restore a semblance of Olympic 
pride by winning the bronze medal.
    
Indeed, credit for reviving Pakistans dismal Olympic hockey fortunes 
does go to Mr. Tiwana who was then at the helm of the countrys hockey 
affairs. Of course, the mechanics and workings of Pakistans hockey is 
not new to PHF President, who himself was pretty adept at playing the 
game during his college days at Atchison.
    
Even though, Mr. Tiwana was able to prize a medal through the efforts of 
former Olympians Islahuddin as the Manager and the late Munawaruz Zaman 
as the coach, he was not satisfied with the bronze and had initiated 
moves to regain the elusive Champions Trophy gold medal in 1994, the 
World Cup at Sydney in December of the same year and the gold in the 
1996 Olympics. Perhaps, providence has provided him with a chance to 
realise one of his ambitions.
    
With only three months left before the Olympics get under way, the task 
at hand seems to be very daunting. Pakistan have only two four-nation 
tournaments to hone the skills of the players before beginning their 
Olympic campaign. One at Milton Keynes (England) from June 13-16 and the 
other at Amstelveen (Netherlands) from June 19 to 23.
    
Nonetheless, Mr. Tiwana, with impeccable credentials as an 
administrator, should find the job all to his liking. The manager of the 
squad is the PHF Secretary, Col. Mudassar Asghar, and the coach is 
former Olympian Manzoorul Hasan.

<a name="fitn">Fitness key to success: goalie Mansoor</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, May 1: Mansoor Ahmed, captain of Pakistan hockey team had no 
hesitation in affirming that the national side for Atlanta Olympics 
would be a lot stronger with the experience of Shahbaz, Khwaja Junaid 
and Wasim Feroze but added that the stalwarts will have to prove their 
fitness in the training camp to catch the bus.
    
He said Here, we are talking of the Olympics where the best teams from 
around the world train exceptionally hard to produce their peak 
performances. It is a big occasion and nobody wants to miss it but for 
that one has to work harder.
    
Commenting on the team that he led to Atlanta, Mansoor said that it was 
the best available team and each member worked hard to produce the 
results, he especially mentioned inside right Muhammad Sarwar who played 
an exceptional game throughout the tournament. However, Mansoor had his 
reservations for left half Shafqat and said that Junaids experience 
even if on the reserves would matter. Every match is different, 
especially facing Asian and European countries in a tournament it 
becomes harder. A continuous onslaught from the Europeans from the right 
flank means a number of short corners and with their perfection in this 
field, it becomes harder to save as many, Mansoor said.
    
About the win at Atlanta, Mansoor said that the team played with 
complete control and kept the tempo, especially against Korea, who are 
considered super fit. We outclassed them 3-0. It took complete team 
work and total fitness to win at Atlanta against teams like Korea, 
England, Argentina, India and America, he said.
    
The Pakistan team is set to participate in two four-nation tournaments 
in June after a five-week training camp at Karachi starting May 2. The 
first tournament in England starts from June 9-13 while the one in 
Holland will be held from June 16-20.
   
Pakistan will be pitted against three European countries England, 
Holland and Germany. Besides, a high class warm-up competition before 
the Olympics the tournaments will provide the last opportunity to the 
participating team to check their weak links. After the tournaments, 
Pakistan may also enter a Test series against Germany.
   
However, the final programme in this regard is yet to come out. It also 
remains to be seen if Shahbaz Ahmed, who has shown utmost interest in 
playing for Pakistan in the forthcoming Olympics, would play under 
another captain or would want to resume his former job as a skipper, 
because the Madras debacle inquiry which led to the ouster of manager 
Rasheed and coach Saeed Khan also meant axing Shahbaz, who was found 
equally guilty of playing poorly and not motivating the full formation.

<a name="appr">Apprehensions about Friendship series</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shujauddin Butt

An interesting news item emanating from Delhi, on March 28, stated that 
Pakistan and India are to play five one day internationals in Canada in 
September this year. According to Mr Inderjit Bindra, President BCCI, 
the series will be called Friendship Cup.
    
If forging of cordial relations is one of the objectives of the 
organisers then why is the Friendship Series being held in Canada? How 
will the series be instrumental in creating friendly relations between 
India and Pakistan
    
Granted that the present political climate between the two countries at 
present may not be conducive to holding such sporting contests in India 
and Pakistan but since 1952 to 1988 there have been several exchanges of 
tours in spite of similar situation.
    
Therefore there is a dire need to break this cricketing impasse. If 
honest efforts are made by the organisers to hold the series in the 
respective countries, it may indeed pave the way to improve our sporting 
relations if not the political climate. However to hold the series in 
Canada only for the sake of minting money would amount to the same 
exercise as was undertaken by the Australian Tycoon Kerry Packer in 
1977/78. It may be a financial bonanza for the players, and of course 
the Management group in charge and also Canada where the matches are 
scheduled to be held.
    
Therefore to fulfil the theme of friendship between the two nations, I 
suggest that there should be a series of six matches, three in each 
country, as a regular feature. If that could be organised it is likely 
to usher in a new era of goodwill and understanding between the two 
boards and the neighbours too. The crowds in both the countries would be 
educated to develop better sense of sportsmanship to accept victory or 
defeat in the normal stride gradually like the Ashes Series between 
England and Australia or for that matter against any other country like 
West Indies, New Zealand or South Africa etc. The frequency of such 
contests is bound to have salutary effect on the crowds of both sides of 
the border.
    
Further more according to Mr Bindra, the Friendship series is also part 
of a plan to popularise the game world wide which may appear to be 
laudable. But let me remind him that is one of the objectives of the 
International Cricket Council and therefore he better be advised to 
desist from arrogating to himself such a vicarious responsibility. 
Similarly Pakistan is well advised to restrict its scope of activities 
of popularising the game in far flung villages and rural areas of 
Pakistan which is badly needed for talent hunting from all over the 
country rather than only a few big cities of Pakistan.
    
If the two Boards of India and Pakistan make up their mind to cooperage 
with each other, the friendship series can be organised within the sub-
continent. In this way the beneficiaries will not only be the two teams 
but it would also promote better understanding between the two nations 
particularly among the hugeness of crowds of cricket fans who throng to 
witness the matches.
    
In fact there are large number of limited overs series being played all 
over the world. The Australians have regularly been holding World Series 
cricket within their own country. Sharjah Cup is staged by the Cricket 
Board of UAE in which foreign teams are invited to participate. The UAE 
team at present is not good enough to participate in the tournament. 
Similarly Singapore and even Hongkong organise One Day limited overs 
matches in which they invite other countries to participate. It is the 
host country which runs and organises such tournaments or championships.
    
It is as such a preposterous concept organising One Day Series between 
two national teams in an alien country in which the three contractual 
parties are India, Pakistan and IMG and not the host country. The 
holding of such a series is bound to transmit wrong signals to the world 
who are well aware of the uneasy political climates between India and 
Pakistan. The logical inference is bound to be that the two national 
teams cannot play each other within their own countries and therefore a 
neutral venue has been picked by the marketing experts whose sole aims 
is to churn money rather than creating friendly atmosphere.
    
To sum up, therefore, it is reiterated that if the series can be 
conducted as I have suggested, it will not only enrich the coffers of 
the two Boards but it will also be good for the cause and popularity of 
the game in the South Asia. The series could then be rightly termed as 
Friendship Cup.

<a name="arch">Archery revived in Pakistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Abdul Rashid Khan

Primordial forms of bow and arrow can be traced back to ancient and 
mediaeval period of history. Archery then was a Profession, a skill as 
well as part and parcel of combat.
    
The passage of time has not only changed the role and range of weapons 
but also the whole system of olden days warfare.
    
The modern age has brought with it many innovations in weaponry. And 
nowadays archery has become a sport, a pastime or a hobby. Its only 
importance for us is that it is among the innumerable Olympic sports.
    
In Pakistan, an organisation by the name of Pakistan Archery Federation 
has been formed to revive a forgotten heritage.
    
Miss Amna Iqbal (22), daughter of Rear Admiral Jawaid Iqbal an MBA, is 
the Vice-President of Federation. In an interview she elaborated the 
aims and objects of the organisation:-
    
Question: How and when did you develop liking for sports, particularly 
archery?
  
Answer: I have always been a sports enthusiast and have played tennis at 
the national level and participated in ICI Pakistan Open, Sindh 
Governors Cup and International Tennis Federation Cup. I won the Naval 
Cup Tennis tournament. I was also a member of Federal Board Netball and 
Athletics team in 1990. Currently I am playing Squash at the National 
level.
    
I took fancy to archery much later in life and began taking part in the 
sport in right earnest. As my interest in archery grew the penchant for 
other sports took secondary place.
    
Question: What is archery?
    
Answer: Archery in its modern form is the art of shooting arrows from a 
bow at a target. Modern composite how is made of wood, plastic and fibre 
glass. It is an extension of the ancient Asiatic bow and is graded by 
number of pounds. Men use bows of 32 to 42 lbs (11.79-15-42 Kg). Those 
of women weigh 26 to 34 lbs (11.79-15-42 kg).
    
Question: How and when was archery introduced in Pakistan and what was 
the response?
    
Answer: Archery was introduced in Pakistan in 1990, when a ten-day 
coaching course was arranged by FITA, the international governing body 
of archery for this purpose. Two British coaches. Philip Van Burn and 
Ken Bearman were sent to Pakistan for two weeks. The course was held in 
Islamabad from January 8 to 17, and was attended by 40 students.
    
The course was followed by the First National Archery Championship held 
on January 18 and 19. It comprised four events namely Mens individual 
event, Ladies event, Junior under-18 event and team event. Ehsan Illahi 
grabbed gold medal in mens event, I won the gold in Ladies event while 
Khurram Shaikh emerged victorious among the juniors.
    
In the meantime, the Archery Federation of Pakistan (AFP) held its first 
congress.
    
A three-member delegation represented Pakistan as observers at the 9th 
Asian Archery Championship in Bangkok in February. A three-member team 
of archers comprising Commander Razaullah Khan, Miss Amna Iqbal and 
Arshad Cheema took part in Bangkok Championship. Participation in the 
contest enabled Pakistan to earn membership of the Asian Archery 
Federation. It is now eligible to send an archery team to participate in 
Asian Games, in Thailand in 1998 as well as the 10th Asian Archery 
Championship to be held in Malaysia in 1997.
    
The AFP is planning to organise a coaching course in Karachi as it is 
determined to popularise the sport in Pakistan as quickly as possible. 
Another task that lies ahead of AFP is to popularise the sport among the 
women so that archery can be included as another discipline in the 
forthcoming Islamic Women solidarity Games.

<a name="iran">Iran, India, Lanka to take part in Quaid volleyball</a>

LAHORE, April 28: India, Iran and Sri Lanka have confirmed their 
participation in the Quaid-i-Azam International Volleyball Tournament to 
be organised at the Liaquat Gymnasium in Islamabad Sports Complex from 
May 6 to 11. Pakistan will field two teams, viz, Pakistan Greens (senior 
string) and Pakistan Whites (junior string).
  
Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) president Chaudhry Mohammad Yaqoob 
told newsmen in a crowded Press briefing at a local hotel that all 
arrangements of the four-nation, 11-day competition among five teams of 
almost equal strength had been completed. The opening and closing 
ceremonies would be telecast live while arrangements were also being 
made to show some other important matches of the contest on the other 
days direct from the gymnasium.
  
Chaudhry Yaqoob said that teams from the brethren Muslim countries of 
the Middle East and the Central Independent States (CIS) had also been 
invited. However, the Middle East countries have sent their regrets for 
non-participation because the examinations of most of the University and 
college students, who form the main strength of their teams, were being 
held during the month of May. The CIS states have said that they were 
unable to send their teams due to paucity of funds. He said that the 
tournament was a humble effort to pay tributes to the Father of the 
Nation, Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah and also to prepare the 
Pakistani senior and junior teams for future international competitions. 
The Pakistan junior team will take part in the Asian Junior Volleyball 
Championship to be held at Ho Chi Minh city (Vietnam) in September next 
while the senior team will take part in the Asian Senior Volleyball 
Championship to be held in Qatar next year.</pre>
