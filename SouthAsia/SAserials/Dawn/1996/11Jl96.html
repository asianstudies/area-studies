KARACHI, July 4: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Thursday announced the 
formation of a three-member committee for providing relief to those 
interned youths who are not involved in heinous crimes.
    
If they admit to committing mistakes under the directives of the Altaf 
group, and if their parents guarantee that their children will not indulge 
again in acts of terrorism, I am prepared to release them, said the prime 
minister while addressing a massive public rally at the German School 
ground in Gulshan-i-Bihar, Orangi.
    
The committee will be headed by the PPP MNA from the area Afaq Shahid, 
representatives of the police and the law department, she said.
    
Those who want relief should contact Afaq Shahid, said the prime minister 
and added that her government would not spare the killers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

LAHORE, July 15: Six people of a family, a woman and her five children, 
were slaughtered by some unidentified people in Muhajirabad, Nawankot, late 
on Thursday night.
    
Bodies of 12-year-old Maqbool and his four-year-old sister Aini were found 
in a store. Four other bodies were recovered from the adjacent bedroom who 
were identified as Shafiqa Begum, 34, nine-year-old Temore, six-year-old 
Haroon and two-year-old Ayesha.
    
The gory drama came to the knowledge of the neighbours when Faisal, a 
nephew of deceased Shafiqa, visited the house on Friday morning. The 
householder, Mansoor Ahmed, was in Gujranwala where he runs his power 
looms. He also returned on Friday at 7.30am.
    
Manzoor Ahmed, the brother of Mansoor said four gold bangles and earrings 
of Shafiqa were missing.
    
Manzoor said Shafiqa had tried to write some thing on the floor with her 
blood but could not complete the message. The knife which was used in 
killing was lying near the four bodies.
    
The incident took place after about 1am.
    
Nawankot police said the motive behind the tragedy could not be 
ascertained.  It could be an enmity or business rivalry, a police officer 
said.

FAISALABAD, July 8: At least two persons were killed and more than 30 
injured in a bomb blast at the Faisalabad railway station here on Monday 
afternoon. One person died on the spot and the other succumbed to injuries 
in hospital.
    
The blast took place at 2pm in the waiting hall for lower-class passengers 
which was crowded with passengers. The bomb was said to have been planted 
under a television set in the hall, and the blast created a 2-1/2 by 2 feet 
crater. Four small shops and an improvised PCO in the hall were also 
destroyed.
    
The person killed on the spot, unidentified so far, had both his legs blown 
off. Some of the injured people also lost their limbs in the blast.
    
The injured were rushed to the DHQ and other hospitals for treatment. All 
the available ambulances in the city were mobilised to shift the injured 
people to hospitals.
    
Police sealed off all routes leading to the railway station, and the bomb 
disposal staff of the Civil Defence Organisation also reached the spot. 
Police had no immediate clue to the incident.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

FAISALABAD, July 9: Chief Minister Arif Nakai said that RAW agents were 
involved in the bomb blast here.

The CM accompanied by Punjab minister for health (urban), the divisional 
commissioner, and other high officials reached the DHQ Hospital and 
inquired about the condition of the injured people.

He paid tributes to the doctors, para-medical staff and citizens for timely 
providing medical aid and donating blood.

An eye-witness told the CM that a suspect came in a rickshaw at the railway 
station and immediately after placing a bag under a bench lying in the 
waiting room, left the station and returned in the same three-wheeler.

The matter was reported to the railway police, but they did not take any 
prompt action, he claimed.

Mr Nakai issued instructions that punitive action be taken against the 
police personnel concerned.

On the occasion, Special Assistant to Chief Minister Chaudhry Umer Draz 
Khan announced that Rs 30,000 would be paid to the heirs of the deceased, 
while Rs 10,000 to the people injured in the blast incident.

Meanwhile, maternal uncle of Muhammad Akram, who was seriously injured in 
the bomb blast, refused to accept a cheque of Rs 10,000 as compensation and 
informed the chief minister that his nephew had been crying since morning 
with severe pain but the doctors on duty did nothing to made him calm.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, July 9: The year-long captivity of four western hostages by the 
Al-Faran group has damaged the reputation of Kashmiri people and caused 
distraction from their cause, said Mrs Jane Schelly Hutchings, wife of an 
American hostage.
    
We do not know who Al-Faran is, but we do know that from Al- Faran 
kidnapping nobody has profited, everybody losses, and the reputation of 
Kashmir cause has been harmed, said Mrs Jane Schelly, wife of Donald 
Hutchings, at a Press conference where Mrs Julie Mangan, wife of a British 
hostage, Keith Mangan, was also present.
    
Reiterating the appeal, Mrs Hutchings said, We do not know where they are. 
We do not know how they are. We do not even know if they are still alive. 
>From the bottom of our hearts we ask each one of you, if you have seen 
Donald or Keith, if you know anything about them or the other hostages, or 
if you have heard about them, please find a way to let us know.

<a name="newd">New Delhi develops nuclear submarine</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, July 6: India has secretly developed a nuclear powered 
submarine equipped with 1,000-kilometre range cruise missiles at a cost of 
over 700 million dollars which is presently being tested, defence sources 
said.
    
It has been developed jointly by the Department of Atomic Energy, the 
Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Indian Navy, 
and was recently described by the authoritative Defence News as Indias 
most secret defence programme.
    
Integration problems are frustrating Indias most secret defence 
programme, as the Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV), has failed tests of its 
compressed enriched uranium water reactor with plate type fuel, the 
journal said in its latest issue.

Although Indias best defence and nuclear scientists are involved in the 
project, the design team has not yet been able to solve several integration 
and fabrication problems. These problems have delayed the land and sea 
tests of the ATVs nuclear power plant.

Menon estimated the Navy would need at least $714.3 million to build the 
nuclear submarine.
    
DRDO and the Navy are responsible for the ships design while the 
Department of Atomic Energy is responsible for the nuclear power unit.

The ATV will be equipped with 1,000 kilometre-range cruise missiles and a 
sophisticated sonar system, DRDO sources were quoted as saying.
    
The India Navy also is working on an indigenously designed 600- 700 ton 
diesel-electric submarine using semi-finished assemblies and components 
from abroad.

<a name="usar">US arms shipment begins from 8th</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, July 5: The United States would begin shipment of arms and 
equipment to Pakistan under the Brown Amendment next Monday and complete it 
by August 31, official sources said.
    
A Pakistan ship will be loaded at Philadelphia port this week to take 
equipment for the Pakistan Army to mark the end of a military embargo 
imposed in 1990 under the Pressler Amendment.
    
Most of the $368 million worth of equipment belonging to the Pakistan Air 
Force and the Army, officials said, would be shipped by sea while the Navy 
would receive the three P3-C Orion planes by air.
    
Sources said Pakistan had requested that a lot of equipment which had been 
ordered before the embargo in 1990 was no longer needed and not be shipped 
but there was still no final decision on what would be done.
    
A Department of Defence official said that most of the equipment which 
would be moving out was lying scattered with contractors and released by 
them for onward shipment.

<a name="hubc">Hubco project starts power supply to national grid</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

HUB, July 4: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto formally inaugurated the 
commissioning of the first 300 megawatt unit of 1,292 megawatt Hubco Power 
Plant, some 40 kilometres north west of Karachi on Balochistan coast. She 
described the occasion, A great day in the history of Pakistan and 
Balochistan province.
    
Hubco Power Plant is considered to be one of the biggest private sector 
electric power generation projects in terms of financial outlay and also in 
terms of electric generation capacity in the developing countries. Benazir 
Bhutto while speaking as Chief Guest, at the ceremony held to mark the 
commissioning of first unit, called it, nothing short of an energy 
revolution and,   a tangible evidence of the successful realisation 
of governments energy policy announced some 30 months ago.
    
Thirty months back, the government chalked out its energy policy and today 
the energy generation has started for supply of electric power to 
industries and homes all over the country, providing fuel to drive the 
economic engine of growth and development, she declared before a gathering 
that included top brass of Hubco Company Sheikh Mohammad Ali Reza, the 
Chairman and Mr D. M. Woodroffe Chief Executive, the Balochistan Governor 
retired General Imranullah Khan and the Chief Minister, Mr Zulfikar Magsi.
    
I promised you reduction in loadshedding, she recalled and said that the 
days of power breakdowns have now reduced considerably.

The government, she said, was giving equal importance to the transmission 
and distribution of electric power from North to South in the country but 
did not elaborate as to what projects are being taken up for this purpose.
  
Speaking about the economic impact that Hubco project made in Pakistan, 
Benazir Bhutto said a sum of 100 million dollars was spent on the local 
supplies of goods and services and engagement of about 4,000 work force 
from Pakistan, mostly from Balochistan. In addition, she said the sponsors 
of the project contributed in supplying electricity to the villages around 
the project site, besides construction of innumerable schools.

She said the first unit of the Hubco project has started transmitting 
electric power in the WAPDAs national grid for onward distribution to 
homes and factories and each of the next three units would be commissioned 
at regular intervals of three months to mark the completion of 1,292 
megawatt power generation by March 1997.

<a name="govt">Govt urged to solve bourses issues, ensure progress</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, July 7: Leaders of all the three stock exchanges of Pakistan 
have urged the government to resolve the three remaining issue for gaining 
confidence of investors, both local and foreign, and ensuring smooth 
development of the capital market.
    
During annual meeting with the Corporate Law Authority and Central Board of 
Revenue at Bhurban recently, they praised the efforts made particularly by 
the CLA chairman for removal of various legal irritants and facilitating 
improved functioning of the bourses.
    
The meeting was attended by presidents of the stock exchanges of Karachi, 
Lahore and Islamabad, M/s Arif Habib, Noshir Dastoor and Tariq Iqbal, 
respectively, and other office bearers, CLA Chairman and Members Jamil 
Bhutto and Abdul Rehman Qureshi and Member (Tax Policy) Ahmed Khan from the 
CBR.
    
The bourses chief expressed satisfaction over number of provisions of the 
1996-97 budget, as elaborated by CBR officials, regarding stock market. 
Notable among these are:
    
(1) The government has accepted their demand for exempting the value of 
membership card from wealth tax.
    
(2) Agreeing with their contention that the new members subscription (Rs 
40 lakh) paid to the stock exchanges concerned is not its revenue but 
capital receipt and should not, therefore, be subject to levy of income 
tax.
    
These measures would send a positive signal to the market, the LSE 
president acknowledged while talking to Dawn.
    
All the three bourses presidents noted that the government had fallen 
short of adopting three more measures in spite of commitments made earlier. 
These include:
    
(1) Withdrawal of income tax on bonus shares, which they regard as a 
disincentive to the companies giving bonus shares to investors.
    
This tax was imposed for the first time under the 1995-96 budget and the 
government had promised to remove it under the new budget.
    
(2) Withdrawal of income tax on trading in shares by the insurance 
companies. As these companies are very big operators in the market, it was 
argued, the tax on their selling and purchasing of shares would act like 
brakes on the development of capital market.
    
In this regard, Dawn was informed by the CLA Chairman that the insurance 
companies themselves had not shown any interest in pursuing the matter with 
the government.
    
(3) The government has not fulfilled its promise to reduce the corporate 
tax by three per cent. Instead of bringing it down to 33%, it has been 
frozen at 36%, it was noted.
    
About the corporate tax, the contention of CBR was that it would constitute 
a loss of Rs 2 billion to the exchequer. Regarding two other demands, it 
was stated that the matter was with the government at the highest level.

<a name="cabi">Cabinet okays export target of $10 billion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, July 7: The federal cabinet approved the foreign exchange budget 
for 1996/97 with the expectation that the countrys external account would 
show a significant improvement over the revised estimates of 1995/96.
    
Briefing newsmen after the cabinet meeting Information Minister Khalid 
Kharal said the cabinet was informed that exports for 1996/97 had been 
projected at $10.046 billion on shipment basis and $9.996 billion on 
payment basis, thus registering an estimated growth of 14.4 per cent.
    
This specific projection is based on the assumption that the next cotton 
crop would yield 10.8 million bales, with an anticipated exportable surplus 
of 1.8 million bales and that the paddy crop would yield 4.2 million tonnes 
leaving a sizeable surplus for export. These export estimates are also 
reinforced by the 7.2 per cent estimated growth rates of the manufacturing 
sector, Mr Kharal said.
    
But, the commerce secretary had reportedly predicted that the exportable 
surplus would be less than 1.8 million cotton bales.
    
In his opinion the global market for textile products, which constitutes a 
major part of Pakistans exports does not promise any improvement in 
prices.
    
Kharal told reporters that the cabinet was informed that import figures for 
1996/97 were likely to increase by 5.1 per cent with a projected figure of 
$12.06 billion on FOB basis.
    
He said the trade deficit was expected to be around $2.1 billion in fiscal 
1996/97 against $2.8 billion during 1995/96.

<a name="remi">Remittances decline</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aslam Sheikh

ISLAMABAD: Notwithstanding depreciating rupee, the receipts of remittances 
from overseas Pakistanis have witnessed a big crash in the year 1995-96, 
oil-producing Gulf countries contributing to it significantly.
    
According to official statistics available here oil-producing countries 
where the bulk of Pakistani emigrants are concentrated reported a decline 
of over 27 per cent in remittances receipts upto May this year (fiscal year 
1995-96) compared to eleven months of fiscal 1994-95. The total remittances 
for this period were also over 21 per cent less compared to eleven months 
of the financial year 1995-96. The remittances from all sources aggregated 
1346.6 million dollars compared to 1718.5 million dollars in 1994-95.
    
While remittances boom of the seventies and eighties which witnessed the 
dramatic rise of remittances from 136 million dollars in 1972-73 to nearly 
three billion dollar in 1982-83 ended long ago, the dip in the outgoing 
financial years receipts is the biggest in one single year during the last 
decade extending a grimmer dimension to Pakistans on-going crisis on the 
balance of payments front. No considered explanation for this big fall from 
remittances from the oil rich region is available from official quarters 
but partly it is explained by a sizeable shift of funds to foreign currency 
accounts. But at best this seems a partial explanation and the sharp 
decline in the overall remittances is attributable to more long term trends 
including politically and economically unstable situation at home.
    
Remittances from UK and USA incidentally have increased by eight per cent 
and 2.4 per cent respectively for nine months of lest fiscal year though 
more than 70 per cent still emanate from the Gulf region. In about a decade 
the share of remittances from USA, increasingly an attractive destination 
for Pakistani emigrants, have doubled in percentage outstripping the 
percentage share of UK, the biggest contributor to remittances in the 
fifties and the sixties. The percentage share over this period for 
remittances from the Gulf region has dropped from the peak of 82 per cent 
in the early eighties to about 70 per cent. 
   
The drop in receipts from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, once major contributors 
to the remittances pool, has been 28 per cent and 35 per cent respectively 
in 1995-96 compared to the July-March period in the preceding year. In the 
first nine months of 1995-96 Saudi Arabia reported 506.74 million dollar 
receipts compared to 705.15 million dollars in the preceding year, 
representing a decline of 28.1 per cent while receipts from Kuwait were 
47.67 million dollars compared to 74.39 million dollars with Oman faring 
better with 63.70 million dollar.
    
The redeeming feature of the scenario, however, is the foreign currency 
deposits which have grown at the rate of 12.7 per cent in a year- rising 
from over three billion dollars at the end of June 1994 to 3383 million 
dollars twelve months later, rising further to 3890 million dollars toward 
the end of March this year, representing an increase of 506 million 
dollars. Nonetheless, the weight of remittances has been so large in the 
balance of payments in the recent history of the country that potential of 
remittances needs to be exploited fully if the ongoing crisis is to be 
overcome because

<a name="acce">Accelerated privatisation vital for capital market</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, July 9: Accelerated privatisation and the utilisation of its 
proceeds for retiring the national debt are essential for enabling the 
capital market of Pakistan to come at par with other emerging markets of 
the world.
    
This was stated by Mr Arif Habib, President of Karachi Stock Exchange and 
Mr Noshir F. Dastoor, President of Lahore Stock Exchange, during separate 
interviews.
    
Agreeing with the remark by the Chairman, Corporate Law Authority, Mr 
Khalil Masud, that the government had removed most of the hurdles in the 
way of the stock exchanges through amendments in the relevant Securities 
law and rationalisation of taxes. A decisive headway had also been made 
towards automating the three stock exchanges of Pakistan and linking them 
by computer. Nevertheless, they pointed out, the budgetary deficit, heavy 
taxation, high rate of inflation and depressed savings still persisted as 
major impediments.
    
Expressing his concern over the budgetary deficit, Mr Arif Habib 
apprehended that Pakistans economy had reached the stage where the country 
might go in default in fulfilling its debt-service obligations. The most 
effective solution to the chronic problem of budgetary deficit lay in 
diversion of privatisation funds for payment of debt.
    
The disinvestment of Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation alone could 
reduce the debt by Rs 42 billion provided this amount was not used for 
filling the budget deficit, the KSE President argued. Most of the remaining 
debt could be wiped out by privatising enterprises like OGDC and WAPDA, he 
added.
    
The sheer weightage of these organisations would go a long way towards 
attracting foreign investors. Such a boost is a dire need of the country 
whose share in the total foreign direct investment is no more than one per 
cent of the total inflows of the emerging markets.

<a name="kse1">KSE 100-share index recovers 5 points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 10: The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices 
recovered another five points but the performance of the broader market was 
lacklustre in the absence of strong demand from the bargain-hunters.
    
The KSE 100-share index was last quoted at 1,663.10 as compared to 1,658.04 
a day earlier, reflecting the strength of the base shares.
    
But in any way it could hardly be described the return of a bull market as 
the recovery in the index is largely based on revival of demand in some of 
the base shares, dealers said.

They said over the last few sessions, the daily volume has fallen from the 
average of 25m shares to 20m shares as a sizeable section of investors has 
already withdrawn to the sidelines.

Analysts said the falling turnover might in a way could be a move to 
forestall further decline in share values and it is positive development in 
the wake of developing situation on the political front.
    
It was perhaps in this background that the price changes were highly 
fractional and reflected a terrible decline in the buying interest rather 
than large selling from any quarter.
    
But rather a section of leading investors was buyer at the falling prices 
and picked up all the sale offers at the dips.
    
Some of the leading shares, which managed to recover were led by Adamjee 
Insurance, Gadoon Textiles, Balochistan Wheels and PSO, which posted fresh 
gains ranging from Rs 2 to 3.
    
Other leading shares, which managed to show good rallies were led by EFU 
Life Insurance, Nishat Mills, Imrooz Modaraba, Genertek, Mari Gas(r), 
Reckitt and Colman, Sandoz Pakistan and Pakistan Hotels, rising by one 
rupee to 2.15.
    
Allawasaya Textiles, which suffered a fresh setback of Rs 25 but without 
any willing buyers at the falling price, again led the list          of 
prominent losers as some  leading sellers tried to liquidate positions.
    
Alico, Rupali Polyester, Mustehkam Cement, General Tyre, Ciba-Geigy and 
Prince Glass followed it, which fell by Rs 2 to 5. Pak-Suzuki Motors, which 
rose by Rs 2 overnight fell by one rupee followed by Telecard, Hoechst 
Pakistan, Parke-Davis and Pakistan Oilfields.
    
On the corporate front, the board of directors of Dadabhoy Insurance 
Company has omitted the dividend for the year ended Dec 31, 1995, but 
announced to give right shares at the rate of 100 per cent at par.
    
The trading volume shrank further to 16.079m shares from the previous 
21.437m shares owing to the absence of leading dealers.
    
Among the actively traded shares, PTC vouchers were again leading, up 40 
paisa on 5.442m shares followed by Hub-Power, steady 10 paisa on 4.020m, 
ICI Pakistan, up 75 paisa on 1.592m, Dewan Salman, firm 15 paisa on 1.125m, 
FFC-Jordan Fertiliser steady five paisa on 0.299m and Lucky Cement, higher 
45 paisa on 0.173m shares.
    
There were 360 actives, out of which 169 shares fell, while 100 rose, with 
91 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="west">Western banks being set up in Muslim states</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, July 9: Western banks and institutions are setting up banks in 
Muslim countries in an effort to enter the market that is growing at a 
breathtaking pace of 15 per cent a year, controlling more than $150 bn 
worth of deposits world-wide.
    
Towards that end, Citibank, a unit of Citicorp has opened a bank in Bahrain 
to offer investment that conform to Islamic religious principles.
    
Following the forced closure of bank of credit and commerce international 
(BCCI) on charges of drug money laundering, a wide gap has been left open 
to capture in Muslim countries.
    
The western banking institutions which once looked down upon the Islamic 
banking practice calling it unworkable and impractical, have had a 
major change of attitude in view of the stupendous growth of Islamic banks 
world-wide.
    
The Citi-Islamic Investment Bank which opened in Bahrain has an initial 
capital of $20 bn and will operate independently from its American parent 
company.
    
Although Citibank is the first western financial institution to found such 
a bank in the Persian Gulf region, other western institutions are likely to 
follow its example.
    
Islamic law forbids charging of interest, so Islamic banks make their money 
by financing trade and construction projects in partnership with their 
depositors, both the bank and depositors share in any profits or losses.
    
Islamic banks also offer equity funds, but they refrain from investing in 
companies involved in gambling or selling alcohol.

<a name="thei">The incompetent authorities</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

THIS column concerns that corrupt, incompetent, inefficient authority, 
WAPDA, and two internationally famed and respected competent efficient 
organisations, one founded by The Hon Charles Stewart Rolls (1877-1910) and 
Sir Frederick Henry Royce (1863-1933), the other by Werner von Siemens 
(1816-1892) and Johann George Halske (1814-1890).
    
The four gentlemen engineers, innovators and inventors, two British, two 
Prussian, would highly disapprove of the recent happenings involving their 
legacies, whose byword is excellence, and a jumped-up Third World 
government.
    
The name Rolls-Royce is synonymous with the best car in the world  Rolls-
Royce owners are not like you and me. (F. Scott Fitzgerald). They are not. 
They include some of the richest, cleverest, wickedest, weirdest, wittiest, 
most charming, most boring, most discriminating, most vulgar human beings. 
Their only common denominator: money. And money was synonymous with the man 
with the longest name and title to ever own a Rolls-Royce: Lieutenant-
General His Highness Ferzand-i-Khas-i-Inglishia, Mansur-i-Zaman, Amir-ul-
Umra, Maharaja Dhiraj Raj Rajeshwar Shree, Maharaja-i-Rajgan, Maharaja Sir 
Bhupindra Singh, Mohinder Bahadur, Yadu Vanshavatans Bhatti kul Bhusshan, 
Maharaja Dhiraj of Patiala, GCSI, GEICE GCVO, GBE.
    
RR later diversified into manufacturing aero engines that were fitted into 
Hurricanes and Spitfires, the fighter planes that won the Battle of Britain 
in WW2. RR then moved on to jet engines (their jets now power the 
Concorde), turbines and electrical equipment. RR recently acquired Engineer 
Alphonse Reyrolles power generation company and named it Reyrolle Ltd.
    
Siemens has moved on from laying telegraph lines all over Germany and now 
concerns itself with every conceivable type of electrical engineering.
    
WAPDA, the incompetent, is now lorded over by ZABs former Loin of the 
Punjab Ghulam Mustafa Khar, who is no more of an engineer than is my 
friend, the Sardar of the Gorgezh tribe. Reyrolle signed with WAPDA an 
agreement on November 30, 1995, for the design, supply, testing and 
commissioning of plant for the Muzaffargarh 500/220 KV sub-station project. 
The value of the contract is estimated to be worth some pound 20 million 
(chicken feed compared to the amounts dealt with and disposed of by our 
bankrupt exchequer). What is to be supplied is static plant and machinery, 
which neither exudes nor emits pollution.
    
Unknown to Reyrolle, the derailment of their contract started even before 
it was signed. On November 18, their competitors, Siemens ABB consortium, 
wrote to Mr Asif Ali Zardari, Chairperson, Pakistan Environmental 
Protection Council, raising an environmental issue  a red herring.
    
Reyrolle fulfilled all their contractual obligations, and in January 1996 
provided the required advance-payment bank guarantee qualifying them to 
receive the mobilisation advance from WAPDA. This was not forthcoming. No 
progress could be made. The British government stepped in, Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhuttos intervention was sought, and on January 15, Ahmed Sadik, 
Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister, wrote to Minister of Water and 
Power, Khar, informing him that, the competent authority has further 
directed that there is no need to reopen the case for award of contract to 
Messrs Reyrolle for Muzaffargarh grid station which was awarded to the 
lowest bidder. WAPDA Authority which is the competent forum, has approved 
the contract.
    
Therefore, Reyrolle received no intimation, no mobilisation advances, so no 
work was done. After four months, on May 8, the British High Commissioner 
in Islamabad wrote to Minister Khar: ....The emission control point seems, 
as far as I can make out, to be a red herring! Of course environment impact 
is an extremely important consideration for power stations; but it is only 
minimally so for grid sub-stations. I imagine that this is why WAPDA did 
not specify environmental issues in the contract documents. Where 
environmental concerns do arise, however, it is over the entirely separate 
power station at Muzaffargarh  with which Reyrolle are not in any way 
connected..
    
No response from WAPDA.
    
On May 14, the Rt-Hon Ian Lang, MP, President of the Board of Trade and 
Secretary of State, Department of Trade and Industry, wrote to Khar: ....I 
gather the Ministry is considering re-awarding the contract to another 
company....To be frank, Pakistan would risk creating for itself a major 
credibility problem if international business suspected that contract 
awards could simply be overturned in this way. I fear that such an image 
would not be easy to remove.....
    
No response again.
    
On May 23, Khars Joint Secretary (Power), Sahibzada Masuad Ali, wrote to 
WAPDA: ...The undersigned is directed to refer to previous correspondence 
on the subject and to convey that the competent authority has been pleased 
to approve that WAPDA may reconsider the award of contract to Messrs 
Reyrolle.... The authority may take immediate necessary action to implement 
the above decision under intimation to this Ministry.....
    
On May 31, Reyrolle London wrote to Mr Wajid Shamsul Hasan, our High 
Commissioner in London, saying that they had to say: I hope by now you 
have had a chance to read my letter of May 28.... May I request, Sir, for 
your advice and assistance at GOP level to restore this serious situation 
to a proper basis so that the contract with us can proceed without further 
delay.....
    
*From His Excellency, no response.
    
On June 3, the British High Commissioner again wrote, this time to the 
Prime Minister: ....However, what most concerns me is the impact on other 
British companies working in Pakistan. Rolls-Royce are a world-renowned 
company and have been eager to work in Pakistan following a meeting with 
you in May 1994.... Any decision now by the Pakistan government to 
terminate their contract with Reyrolle would jeopardise Pakistans growing 
reputation in the United Kingdom as a good country to do business. I would 
therefore be extremely grateful if you felt able to instruct those 
responsible for implementing the Muzaffargarh sub-station project, to do so 
in a spirit of fairness, and with due consideration to the contractual 
obligations which have been entered into.
    
Once more, no response.
    
On June 14, the Managing Director of Reyrolle, London, wrote to Khalid 
Javed, the WAPDA Chairman: It was a pleasure to meet you on Monday and 
Wednesday last week and I hope you managed to achieve a few hours of 
relaxation during your busy schedule in the UK.... Secondly, we are aware 
that you have been notified by the Ministry to recommence negotiations with 
a competitor in spite of the fact that WAPDA and Reyrolle have a binding 
contract.... In the absence of a clear confirmation that the contract will 
proceed, there appears to be no choice but to resort to legal proceedings 
to protect our contractual rights.
    
In keeping with the track record, no response.
    
On June 21, Fenwick Elliot, Reyrolles London solicitors, wrote to the 
WAPDA Chairman: ....Any endeavour on WAPDAs part to place this contract 
with any other party would be a breach of the contract between our client 
and WAPDA.... Any such action on WAPDAs part would be an abuse of the 
tender procedure...(and) would expose WAPDA to an action for injunctive 
relief, and to a claim for damages (including, should the fact permit it, 
exemplary damages) from our client.....
    
No response, naturally.
    
Reluctantly, Reyrolle filed a suit in the Court of the Senior Civil Judge, 
Lahore, and along with it also filed an application praying that the GOP 
and WAPDA be restrained, from taking or acting or purporting to act upon 
any decision or doing any act that would result in any 
termination/cancellation of the contract and/or the award of the project to 
any person other than the Plaintiff. It is further prayed that an ad-
interim injunction may be issued against the Defendants.
    
On July 2, the application was heard. As the judiciary is now fully 
judicious and assertive, the good judge was pleased to grant an ex-parte 
injunction.  Every man of affairs and every man of straw in Pakistan knows 
that there are two parallel governments (neither of which have any regard 
for time or for our money) operating at a tangent with each other. Each 
time a man sees the words competent authority, what springs immediately 
to mind is incompetence and abuse of authority. The competent authority 
shrouds itself in anonymity. What? Why can it not just plainly say, the 
Prime Minister, or, the Chairman of the EPA? Why is it frightened to 
give its true name? Is it because it knows it is always doing wrong?
    
Whereas on January 15, the de jure authority directed that there was no 
need to reopen the case for the award of the contract to Reyrolle, on May 
23 the de facto authority was pleased to approve that WAPDA may 
reconsider the award of the contract to Reyrolle. The High Commissioner for 
the United Kingdom in Pakistan, Sir Christopher Macrae, seems to have 
failed in his duty to correctly inform the government he represents of the 
true position prevailing in Pakistan.

<a name="lear">Learning from the Bosnian crisis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto

TODAY, investigators are slowly unearthing the remains of murdered Muslims 
in the mass graves surrounding Srebrenica. As the dirt is removed and the 
bodies are identified and laid to rest, a horrible chapter of our modern 
history is being documented.
    
Now the world has tangible proof of a level of carnage and brutal savagery 
that defies belief. We have proof of a viciousness seldom seen since the 
genocide in Cambodia and the on-going terror in Kashmir.
    
No longer can we question whether or not this ethnic cleansing is a 
brutal reality. We know for certain that Western nations stood by as 
uninterested witnesses to events that bore an uncanny resemblance to 
Hitlers Final Solution.
    
So now, as we expose this single great massacre, we should also throw light 
on the foolishness and ignorance that allowed these events to occur. How we 
could have let such genocide into our lives again?
    
The people of the Muslim world have long been bewildered at the 
indecisiveness of Western countries in taking punitive measures against the 
Serbs when it seemed obvious that force was the only language these 
criminals could understand.
    
The weakness of the United Nations came as a shock to us, as well. After 
all, the United Nations is perceived as the centrepiece of the new global 
order, focusing on the rights of women and children, protecting the 
environment and dealing with runaway population growth. And most 
importantly, the United Nations has a basic duty to prevent conflict and 
bring opposing parties to peaceable agreements.
    
Part of our surprise was due to the sharp contrast between the Wests 
reaction to the events in Bosnia and its reaction during the Gulf War. The 
world, under the UN banner, acted with alacrity and unity in confronting 
the occupation of Kuwait in 1990. What happened to the speed, decisiveness 
and co-operation that proved so effective against Iraq? Did innocent 
Bosnian Muslims not deserve the worlds help? It seemed that the West was 
deliberately indifferent to or, worse, intolerant of different religions 
and beliefs.
    
But while other nations stood by, the Muslim world and the people of 
Pakistan demonstrated what could have  should have  been done to prevent 
the crises. We treated the Bosnian crisis as the major global travesty that 
it has proven to be.
    
Pakistanis, who have long been victims of Indian aggression, immediately 
empathised with the Bosnian people. We knew mere UN resolutions would not 
stop the bloodshed  decisive action was the only answer. Pakistan urged 
members of the Security Council to authorise the use of force against the 
Serbian aggressors, worked for a Special Declaration on Bosnia at the 
Vienna World Conference on Human Rights and helped organise the efforts of 
other Muslim nations. Most importantly, Pakistanis risked their lives so 
that Bosnia could have peace, sending 3,000 troops to join the UN 
Protection Force.
    
During my visits to France, Germany and England in 1994, I personally 
stressed the importance of Bosnia to world leaders. In 1995, I urged US 
President Bill Clinton and then Sen. Bob Dole to lead America in fulfilling 
its responsibilities as the worlds only superpower by helping to end the 
Bosnian conflict.
    
Finally, in consultation with other Muslim leaders, I offered a Muslim 
force under the UN banner should the arms embargo be lifted and Western 
troops be withdrawn, as they wee hinting they would do.
    
Although I stressed that it was a European conflict that needed a European 
involvement in the solution, if Western nations couldnt withstand the 
pressures of public opinion, Muslim countries would fill the void.
    
To drive home this point, then Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller and I 
travelled to Bosnia, where we wore flak jackets and were surrounded by 
gunfire. We went to show the commitment of our nations to the Bosnian 
people and to witness the courage and determination with which the 
persecuted Muslims faced their aggressors.
    
After all the bloodshed and anguish, what have we learned? That a quick 
solution to the Bosnian conflict was a necessity. That appeasement and 
hesitation only encourage elements of disharmony and disorder in other 
nations.
    
When provided with the right leadership, a peaceful parting of the ways is 
possible, such as the division that gave birth to the Czech and Slovak 
republics under the guidance of Vaclav Havel.
    
When leadership is abdicated and responsibility is renounced, we allow the 
likes of Radovan Karadzic to begin their massacres. That should be our 
enduring lesson.Copyright 1996 Dawn/ Creators Syndicate, Inc.

<a name="advi">Advice to PTV</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

THERE were no newspapers on Tuesday (July 2) and since we are creatures of 
habit, I re-read the previous days and truthfully did not feel short-
changed except that I could not update myself on Pakistans match against 
Glamorgan.
    
There is a muchness about the newspaper in terms of hard news and the 
national scene seems dominated almost entirely by charges and counter-
charges, by threats and counter-threats, by forebodings and counter-
forebodings, as if we were in a state of perpetual agitation and strife. 
This may well be the case and if it is then it is a sorry state of affairs. 
But that is not what I propose to write about because of the utter futility 
of doing so.
    
Politics plays only a marginal role in the lives of the people, mainly 
because people are irrelevant to the politicians except when they are 
needed to vote or to make up a crowd for a jalsa or a procession or more 
grimly to receive the comeuppance (by proxy) when matters get out of hand 
and irate law-enforcing agencies try to restore order, by fair means or 
foul. Unless I missed it, in all the furore about the budget which included 
strikes and sit-ins, nowhere did I come across a demand for clean drinking 
water, something that is not available to more than half of our population. 
It is at times like this that I am reminded of Oscar Wildes verdict on 
fox-hunting  the unspeakable in full pursuit of the uneatable.
    
But with no newspapers, in most other countries, people would have turned 
to television to fill the void, as it were. Not so here for we would have 
been dished out the familiar bread and water. I dont know if PTV did but I 
doubt that they had special news bulletins to make up for the lack of 
newspapers.
    
I do not watch television very much and PTV even less. It is not that I am 
particularly demanding but PTV provides me with neither news nor 
entertainment. Not just this government but every government since Ayub 
Khans has had a lock on the electronic media and when there were no other 
choices, they had a captive audience. Not so many more. Even before 
television came to Pakistan, there was the transistor radio and by turning 
a knob one could get switched on to the radio stations of the world. 
Illiterate most of our population may have been, they were even then very 
well informed. Something that was not entirely comprehended by those who 
manipulated and engineered the news. Often the BBC Urdu Service became the 
primary source of news, the other source being rumour. Radio Pakistan, 
invariably ran a poor third.
    
But it is the dish antenna that has really shown up PTV. There are now so 
many choices that there is an embarrassment of riches. I can understand the 
reluctance of a government to give up its control on the news but there is 
much more to television than the news. There is sports, for instance. There 
is really no reason why we cant be competitive in this field.
    
PTV chose not to show Euro 96 and thus deprived thousands of football fans 
from watching a tournament that had the rest of the world glued to their 
sets. Even in countries like India, the viewership was sizeable and like us 
they did not have a team in the tournament. The viewership of Euro 96 was 
in billions. Is it PTVs judgement that viewers in Pakistan do not care 
about football? They are sadly mistaken. There has always been a demand 
that Pakistan should be doing something about seriously creating an 
interest in football.
    
It is a game that our young people should be playing, even in preference to 
cricket, sacrilegious as it may sound coming from someone like me. There 
can be no better way of attracting young people to the game than by showing 
them top class football. Euro 96 has concluded. And Wimbledon too is on 
its final legs and the test series between India and England is coming live 
on ESPN as will the Pakistan matches. Star Sports had Wimbledon live and 
ESPN is covering Indias tour of England in detail. There was a news item 
recently that Rupert Murdoch was in India and was seriously considering 
moving the Star TV Network to India.
    
We may lament (or get incensed) about what is perceived as cultural 
invasion but others are forging ahead and we are not even able to 
safeguard our own backyard. If other channels offer better choices, better 
programmes than PTV then people will switch to these channels. It is as 
simple as that. I dont think there is a conscious attempt to subvert us 
culturally. Thats just our imagination, our paranoia.
    
There is no shortage of talent in this country. Given the chance we can 
compete with the best there is and we have proved it in many fields. 
Despite the fact that PTV pays its artists what really are slave wages, 
people do come forward. Take cricket commentary for instance. We get the 
princely sum of Rs 700 for a full days broadcast. Thats about 6 hours. 
Recently I was rung up by BBC from London and they wanted to ask me a 
couple of questions. This was during the World Cup. The conversation lasted 
about two minutes. I was delighted to receive a cheque of pound 50, the 
equivalent of four days cricket commentary on PTV! But I still do the 
commentary on PTV and invariably end up out of pocket.
    
Its not the money that attracts talent. But opportunity. And PTV must 
throw away the old mould and start to get competitive or it will find that 
it has no viewers.

<a name="them">The mugging of the social contract</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

WHATEVER happened to the recommendations of the Task Force for the Social 
Contract? This formidable body, headed by none other than the Governor of 
Sindh, had suggested an array of far- reaching changes in Pakistans 
administrative structure.
    
Predictably, this report is not going to be implemented anytime soon. In 
fact, the whole thing has become a bit of an embarrassment, not unlike a 
marriage proposal made in a moment of weakness. When the ruling party was 
in the opposition, its leader got a lot of mileage out of her avowed 
support for the concept of the devolution of power to the grassroots level. 
Indeed, she came out strongly for local elected leaders running the affairs 
of their community, thus marginalising the district administration. A 
number of us, fed up with the current system which had clearly failed to 
deliver, supported Benazir Bhutto in her crusade to reform the 
administrative structure.
    
But like many other electoral promises politicians make at the whiff of an 
election, this one, too, has been jettisoned at the first opportunity. 
Actually, judging from the ruling partys contempt and distrust of the 
whole concept of local government as demonstrated by the indecent haste 
with which the Punjab Assembly recently abolished the local bodies law, it 
is clear that its commitment to democracy is only skin deep. In fact, one 
suspects that most politicians in and out of positions of authority regard 
the parliamentary system itself only as a vehicle to achieve political 
power. No more and no less. 
   
They discover the virtues of the rule of law and a democratic order only 
when they are out in the cold, being kicked around by the government of the 
day. As soon as they are back in the saddle, democratic institutions that 
inhibit their exercise of absolute power become annoying checks to be 
dumped or marginalised as soon as possible.
    
Seen against this backdrop, the ignominious fate of elected local bodies 
was fairly predictable. Dismissed by Moeen Qureshis caretaker government 
on the persistent demand of the PPP, they have stayed in limbo ever since. 
At the time, their sacking seemed logical: dominated by Nawaz Sharifs 
Muslim League in Punjab, there was every possibility that they would be in 
a position to influence the outcome of the national and provincial 
elections. It was widely assumed that soon after the formation of the new 
government, local body elections would be held.
    
But the more cynical among us made no bets on this seemingly obvious 
sequence of events: having seen the electoral results in urban Punjab  the 
outcome in urban Sindh being a foregone conclusion  they knew that the 
ruling party would never risk the embarrassment of having hostile local 
governments dominating most cities in the make-or-break province of Punjab. 
Quite apart from the humiliation, political tactics were involved: anti-PPP 
councillors and mayors could  and probably would  oppose and confront the 
PDF coalition provincial government at every turn, making sure that 
development funds were funnelled only to Nawaz Sharifs supporters. Thus, 
in terms of Pakistani realpolitik, local body elections were seen by the 
ruling party as being against its interests and, therefore, to be avoided 
like the plague.
    
So when the higher judiciary restored local bodies, the government had very 
few options available, and all of them were bad. But by choosing to undo 
the courts decision through a parliamentary ploy, the confrontation with 
the judiciary has been sharpened. In the short term, this bodes ill for the 
government; in the long term, it bodes ill for the system.
    
In a sense, the present bad blood between the executive and the judiciary, 
on the one hand, and the government and the opposition, on the other, once 
again underlines the lack of tolerance that infects our body politic. Just 
because the Chief Justice would not elevate a very junior government 
nominee to the Sindh High Court, we have a situation where the higher 
judiciary is perceived as interpreting the law to the ruling partys 
disadvantage. 
   
But this perception should not lead to paranoia: the recent judgement on 
local bodies was clearly aimed at restoring elected municipal committees 
that the government itself was committed to strengthening through the Task 
Force for the Social Contract.  Indeed, the entire unfolding scenario makes 
one fear for the viability of the system. If an assertive judiciary and an 
executive with a siege mentality are going to be involved in a series of 
debilitating showdowns, neither institution will be strengthened; rather, 
our hard-won democratic order will be weakened. Clearly, a modus vivendi 
between the two has to be worked out. 
   
This applies equally to the ruling party and the opposition: if successive 
federal governments fear that their rivals will hamstring them if they form 
provincial and local governments, they will do their best to ensure that 
this does not come to pass, even if they have to resort to highly dubious 
methods. This has already come to pass in Punjab and the NWFP.
    
It is high time that our politicians acquired some maturity and wisdom. 
There are already voices in the wings whispering seditious ideas, and 
pointing out the many failings of our leaders to substantiate their 
unacceptable claim that democracy does not and cannot work in Pakistan. But 
those clamouring for a change should remember that ultimately, any system 
is only as good or as bad as those who work it. 
   
Having tried a number of political systems, we have reverted to 
parliamentary democracy because there is a broad-based consensus behind it. 
We cannot discard the present system just because of the venality and 
incompetence of a handful of politicians: as we know to our cost, other 
experiments have failed because those conducting them did not believe in 
them any more than our current rulers believe in democracy.
    
To repeat a tired clichi, we stand at the cross-roads of our political 
development. The founders of Pakistan started out fifty years ago with a 
democratic ideal before them. Events and individuals subverted that ideal 
before it could take root. 
   
After many fits and starts and with several dictatorial detours, we have 
finally achieved the cherished goal of a democratic dispensation. Shall we 
allow a bunch of greedy, power-hungry politicians to wreck a system we have 
all fought for? Let us not forget that democracy does not belong just to 
the politicians: we all have a stake in it. If the country slides back to 
autocracy, we will all suffer the consequences.
    
As we all know, in the law of the jungle, the opportunists and the lotas 
thrive. In Pakistan, there is no shortage of either.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="nati">National Games to be held in Karachi</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, July 7: Syed Wajid Ali Shah was re-elected President and Muhammad 
Latif Butt Secretary General of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) for 
the next four-year term (1996 to 2000).
 
The meeting dealt with a heavy agenda and took some important decisions. 
Mohammad Latif Butt briefed the newsmen about the deliberations of the 
meeting shortly after its conclusion.
 
A representative of the Sindh Government informed the meeting that Governor 
and Chief Minister have agreed to host the 26th National Games in Karachi. 
However, the General Council asked the Sindh Government to submit a 
detailed plan of holding the National Games in Karachi by Aug 7. If it 
failed to do that, the Games will be allocated to NWFP Olympic Association 
which has already submitted its plan to host the Games in a befitting 
manner.

The Secretary Generals report said that three regional courses in 
basketball, gymnastics and weightlifting and as many national courses in 
cycling, tennis and yachting had been allocated to Pakistan for 1996. For 
each regional course, the IOC Solidarity Commission would pay $18,000 and 
for every national course $8,250. The basketball regional course will be 
held at Lahore from Sept 28 to Oct 11. The gymnastics course will also be 
organised at Lahore from Oct 4 to 15. The weightlifting course will be held 
at Islamabad from Oct 15 to 28. The national course in cycling will be held 
at Lahore from September 1 to 14, the tennis course at Islamabad from Sept 
20 to 23 and the yachting course at Karachi from Oct 2 to 18. The General 
Council confirmed minutes of its earlier meeting held on Jan 18 this year. 
The meeting approved audited statement of the 1995-96 accounts.

An amendment in the POA constitution was also approved which makes it 
compulsory to resolve all disputes within and amongst its member units as 
well as those arising on the occasion of Olympic Games and other games 
through arbitration. It forbids the bodies from going to courts. After 
receiving the arbitration report, the disputing bodies may appeal to the 
IOC Arbitration Commission which would give its award within 21 days of 
receiving that. All concerned have been asked not to go for litigation.

<a name="paki">Pakistan backing Dalmia to head ICC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Athar Ali

LONDON, July 8: The International Cricket Council (ICC) members have 
started their deliberations to resolve administrative and technical issues. 
The Honorary Secretary of the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI), 
Jagmohan Dalmia, is being tipped to succeed Sir Clyde as Chairman of the 
ICC though there are two other candidates, one from Australia and the other 
from South Africa.
    
The draw for the 1999 World Cup, to be hosted by England is also to be 
held. Informal consultations between ICC members and associates will 
continue throughout the week but lobbying for the election of the Chairman 
is in full swing. Pakistan is being represented at the meeting by Cricket 
Board Chairman, Zulfikar Bukhari, Chief Executive, Majid Khan, and the PCB 
special representative Ehsan Mani. The most important item on the agenda 
for the ICC meeting is the election of the Chairman to replace Sir Clyde 
who completes his four-year term early next year. Besides Dalmia Malcolm 
Gray of Australia and Chris Mackerdhuj, President of the South African 
United Cricket Board, are also contesting for the post.
    
Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka, the three who hosted this years World Cup, 
are supporting Dalmia as Chairman. The votes of the nine full members are 
thus divided. Full members have two votes each while each of the 22 
associate members holds one vote. The contest may not be decided in the 
first ballot and then goes to a second ballot unless one of the candidates 
decides to withdraw at the last moment.
    
According to informed sources Dalmia has a better chance of winning the 
election. The founding members of the ICC have not accepted the change for 
having a chairman from outside the group. They think this impairs the 
authority of the ICC and moves the centre of gravity of international 
cricket away from London.

<a name="game">Game of hi-tech at Atlanta</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, July 9: As the countdown to the centennial Olympic Games in 
Atlanta has begun it seems that the athletes are not the only ones who will 
be competing in the games: The high tech computer and electronic companies 
will be there too, competing in their field of expertise.
    
Complex, intricate and highly technical infrastructure is installed at the 
site of the Olympiad to monitor everything from security to traffic, 
weather to telecommunications by I.B.M, American Telephone and telegraph, 
M.C.I., Eastman Kodak, Motorola, Panasonic to test their latest 
technological inventions. These inventions will be at the games, albeit, on 
the sidelines.
    
More than 15,000 athletes and coaches, two million spectators at Atlanta 
and three billion television viewers world-wide will depend on the modern 
high-tech infrastructure at the games.
    
Almost 300 million dollars worth of technology is already in place and the 
operation centre created thus far is being compared to Houston Command 
Control Centre which launches and monitors Americas space programme.
    
The operation centre is the hub where high trained crew of technical 
specialists, most of them sent in by the big corporations, who have stake 
in the technology, will monitor and manage 7,000 computers, 9,000 radio 
phones, 6,000 pagers, 1,000 facsimile lines and 8,000 cable connections. 
Panasonic has installed 10,000 video monitors for every activity on the 
field and off it.
    
If the athletes are going for the gold, the big corporations are making 
efforts for the same. They have both prestige and earnings in their Olympic 
plan.
    
The list of technical innovations for the games is long and diverse. 
Athletes and coaches will wear special security badges that broadcast 
access codes and information, as the wearer approaches the security 
checkpoints, using microchips embedded in the plastic. Everyone from the 
spectators to the journalists will be issued cards or passes which will be 
encoded, allowing them access to certain areas and keeping them at bay from 
others.
    
To help the anticipated traffic rush in the city, Atlanta has augmented its 
traffic system with remote sensors, video cameras and global positioning 
system. Eventually, when linked to on-board navigation system now beginning 
to appear in several models of cars, the system will be able to monitor 
automobile traffic on major roads throughout the city.
    
But the city officials are still warning people not to arrive in Atlanta 
during the Olympic games with their cars, trucks or recreational vehicles.
