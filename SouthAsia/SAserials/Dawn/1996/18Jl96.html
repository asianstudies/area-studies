<a name="paki">Pakistan still undecided on CTBT</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, July 17: Pakistan is understood to be still undecided on signing 
the proposed Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) as it continues studying 
the complicated and inconclusive diplomatic manoeuvres at the UN forum in 
Geneva and in various world capitals which have remained involved in 
hammering out the treaty for the last 40 years.
    
The CTBT has got stuck particularly in the latest stages of its 
finalisation at Geneva where it was being debated, mainly as a result of 
Indias stiff opposition to the draft treaty.
    
The change in the Indian position during the finalisation of the draft 
treaty occurred from its earlier fervour rather abruptly in 1995 following 
the indefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and possibly 
because of belated realisation by it that the nuclear powers could continue 
some form of sub-critical nuclear testing and, thus, maintain their 
arsenals despite the CTBT while debarring all its other adherents.
    
Pressing its opposition to the draft treaty which had been formulated after 
meeting numerous conflicting amendments and demands from several of the 
active participants in the CTBT debate, India explicitly linked the CTBT at 
the Cartagene Non-Aligned Summit, to a commitment by the nuclear weapon 
states to a phased programme of complete nuclear disarmament within a 
time-bound framework to which several of the nuclear weapon states were 
not willing to accept.

<a name="usar">US arms spares released</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, July 17: After seven years of sanctions imposed under Pressler 
Amendment barring military and economic aid to Pakistan, some 8 million 
dollars worth of army spare parts left Philadelphia port on Tuesday night 
aboard Pakistan shipping vessel M.V. Chitral.
    
The consignment which signals the implementation of the Brown Amendment 
which stipulates release of some 368 million dollars worth of military 
hardware to Pakistan consisted of rebuilt spares for tanks, army personnel 
carriers, ARVS, etc.
    
The parts which were stored at US army storage facility in Seneca, New 
York, were brought to the Philadelphia port two weeks ago to be readied for 
shipment aboard M.V. Chitral.
    
The Brown Amendment which was passed following intensive lobbying efforts 
by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who had insisted last year that either 
Pakistan be given back the money it paid the U.S. government for the 
military equipment or release the shipment, is a one time waiver until the 
Pressler law is repealed.

<a name="wash">Washington working on South Asia package</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, July 15: The Clinton administration is earnestly working on a 
comprehensive South Asia package that will include proposals on all hot 
issues including non-proliferation, Kashmir, future US economic and 
military co-operation in the region and may possibly be made public some 
time next month, knowledgeable sources said.
    
The package will incorporate to a large extent the outlines presented by 
Prof. Stephen Cohen which called for a South Asian Camp David accord and 
may envisage sending one, or possibly even two, US envoys to the region, 
they told Dawn.
    
While details of the proposals the administration may have in mind are not 
yet available, sources said it was becoming clear that the package was 
likely to come out not only before the November presidential elections but 
even before the signing of the CTBT, currently stalled by the Indians.
    
The Cohen Plan, circulating inside the Beltway in policy-making circles for 
several months, had suggested names of US special envoys to mediate between 
India and Pakistan on Kashmir only but the administration is apparently 
working on a much larger canvas and wants to include all relevant issues 
that are inter-linked in the region.
    
Some of the names circulating on the Capitol Hill for being sent as special 
envoys include Republican Sen Hank Brown and Democratic Sen Sam Nunn, both 
of whom are retiring this November.
    
Sen Brown is well known in Pakistan and worked for the recent release of 
military equipment to Pakistan while Sen Nunn is known to be highly 
respected and may be acceptable to the Indians compared to any one else, if 
they agreed to the US plans.

Some South Asian analysts, however, say a US initiative linking 
proliferation issues to Kashmir could turn out to be a no-win deal for 
Pakistan as under the ominous pressure of getting India onboard the CTBT 
train, Washington may concede much more to New Delhi than may otherwise be 
necessary and all at Islamabads expense.
    
They base their arguments on what they call the apparent fact that 
Pakistan has placed all its nuclear eggs in the Indian basket.
    
Whenever any one talks of NPT or CTBT in Islamabad, what comes out is that 
Pakistan would sign only if India does it. That practically means that 
Pakistan has exported all the bargaining chips to New Delhi thus placing 
India in the loveable position of extorting the best deal from the West, 
the argument goes.

<a name="orde">Orders reserved in appeals by three American students</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 11: Orders have been reserved in the appeals filed by three 
American youths who were sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment and 
a fine of Rs 2 million each for attempt to smuggle 12 kg heroin out of the 
country.

The appellants were Christopher Rollins Kelly, Ms Carrier Leigh Dempsey and 
Ms Jody Lynn Fobled, all from New York and students. 
   
They were arrested on July 11, 1995, at the Jinnah Terminal and sentenced 
to imprisonment and fines on Oct 31 the same year by the special judge, 
customs and taxation.
    
The heroin was recovered from their baggage.

The Americans, in their twenties and studying in various schools in New 
York, have taken a plea of their young age and first time offenders, 
without knowing the consequences.
    
Another appeal has been filed on behalf of the customs maintaining that the 
sentences were mild and that they should be enhanced. Both the appeals have 
been heard by the court and the judgement reserved for a latter date.

<a name="camp">Campaign against Sialkot footballs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 13: A group of US Congressmen have mounted a fresh pressure 
campaign against Pakistan for putting a ban on Sialkot-made sport goods, 
particularly the footballs in the next Olympics to be organised at the US 
city, Atlanta.
    
Sport goods exporters based in Karachi have received messages from 
Washington which reveal that a group 38 members led by Representative 
Joseph Keneddy, D-Massachusetts approached the Olympic Committee President 
Juan Antonio Samaranch calling for a ban on soccer balls produced by child 
labour.
    
In their representation, the US politicians alleged that soccer balls to be 
used at this summers Olympic Games in Atlanta Georgia had been produced by 
bonded labourers as young as 6 years old. Calling upon the Olympics not to 
use balls tainted by the hands of child labourers, these Congressmen 
charged that footballs are being stitched by children working under a 
system run by labour contracting middleman. Under this system, children as 
young as six or seven years old are reported to be working 80 hours a week, 
earning at little as six cents an hour.
    
For quite long, Pakistan has been the main target of US politicians who 
charge the Pakistani manufacturers and exporters of using child labour in 
production of fine-hand knotted carpets and sport goods.

<a name="pppi">PPP issues booklet to counter Imran</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tariq Saeed

TOBA TEK SINGH, July 12: The PPP high command has released a booklet  
Talking Points  to counter anti-PPP remarks by Imran Khan. The PPP workers 
have been provided with such booklets.
    
The booklet said: Imran Khans cancer hospital was built with almost 90 
per cent support of the government. 
   
The government contribution, included Rs 50 million donated by Mr Nawaz 
Sharif when he was in office, price free land in Lahore donated by Mr Nawaz 
Sharif, a medical camera worth more than US $2 million donated by a public 
sector organisation during the Benazir Bhuttos government, and tax 
concession amounting to Rs 300-400 million for import of machinery given by 
the Benazir government.
    
Free tickets were also given by PIA for fund raising efforts. It was only 
after eminent social worker Sattar Edhi alleged that Imran Khan wanted to 
rope him into an extra-constitutional overthrow of the Benazir government 
that the government stopped its support, the booklet says.
    
It also claims that Imran Khan has never explained how many private 
patients are treated at full cost and how many patients are treated free at 
his cancer hospital nor has be explained why the cost is astronomically 
higher in his hospital than in government-owned hospitals.
    
Regarding television advertising, the booklet says while Imran Khan 
complaints that the PTV does not allow ads for his hospital, he fails to 
mention that he was allowed ads on TV during and before the Benazir 
government.
    
The ads were disallowed only after the Edhi episode. Imran Khan never 
refers to the PTV policy of not allowing ads to political parties or 
individuals in the name of a social cause.
    
According to the booklet, Imran Khan says that he is against the VIP 
culture. 
   
Yet he insists on using the VIP lounge at airports, travels first class, 
holds his Press conferences in five-star hotels and drives expensive cars 
and jeeps. No-one would mind all this if Imran Khan did not lecture others 
on simplicity, the booklet says.

<a name="cont">Contract system, ban on trade unions to go</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque 

ISLAMABAD, July 17: The federal government has eventually formulated a 
long-awaited labour policy that calls for immediately abolishing the 
contract labour system and lifting of ban on trade unions in various 
autonomous bodies.
    
The labour policy will be presented and approved by the cabinet on July 29 
after which it will be implemented in letter and in spirit, declared State 
Minister for Labour and Manpower Ghulam Akbar Lasi.
    
He said that the government had decided to eliminate what he termed the 
menace of contract labour in all the private industrial organisations. 
   
Although it took lot of time but a very comprehensive labour policy has 
been prepared, he claimed.
    
Explaining the salient features of the labour policy Mr. Lasi said while 
the issue of contract labour has been adequately covered in it leaving no 
room for its continuation in whatsoever form, it was also decided to allow 
the establishment of trade unions in all the autonomous and semi-autonomous 
bodies.
    
The new labour policy also calls for lifting ban on trade unions in 
various organisations including Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation and 
Pakistan Television Corporation, the state minister for labour disclosed.

One of the major recommendations of the new labour policy is the setting 
up of Minimum Wage Commissions both at the federal and provincial levels to 
provide salaries to the labourers in such a manner that they should be able 
to counter the effects of price hike, Mr Lasi added.
    
I want to make it clear that the industrialists would have to accept the 
recommendations of the proposed Minimum Wage Commissions with a view to 
offering reasonable salaries to the labourers and workers, he further 
said.

Answering a question, he said it was very difficult for the government to 
determine the salaries of the private employees.
    
We did consider to offer minimum salary of Rs3000 to Rs4000 but then we 
concluded that the job should be done by the Minimum Wage Commissions, he 
added.
    
These commission, he pointed out, would take into account the incident of 
inflation on regular basis and determine the salaries of the labourers and 
the workers.

<a name="ibmt">IBM to computerise 68m identity cards</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, July 12: The government has decided to award a Rs3.4 billion 
contract to the IBM, Pakistan, for computerising 68 million identity cards 
without, however, observing the laid down procedure of inviting tenders 
through newspaper advertisements.
    
While a formal approval by the prime minister is still being awaited a 
decision to award the contract to IBM has been taken in principle by the 
Cabinet on a summary forwarded by the interior division.
    
The finance division has already cleared the contract documents while the 
interior division is going through the fine print of these documents.
    
Under the proposed contract, the government will not spend a single penny 
on the project while the general public will pay Rs50 for each card, out of 
which the government will keep Rs9 and pass on Rs41 to the IBM.
    
It is not known how much did it cost the government to computerise the 9 
million cards belonging to the people of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The 
general public in these two cities obtained their computerised cards for 
just as little as Rs5 called stamp fee.
    
The build-operate-transfer(BOT) project of the IBM which will earn it a 
neat package of Rs2.78 billion and the exchequer around Rs522 million will 
be handed over to the government after an estimated four or five years, the 
time required to complete the computerisation of all 68 million cards.

<a name="legh">Leghari for NA, Senate bodies to check corruption</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, July 14: Declaring the corruption as a national problem, 
President Farooq Leghari called for setting up of select committees of 
the Senate and the National Assembly to probe deep into the issue of 
corruption and find remedies to eradicate this evil from the society.
    
In a letter written to leader of the opposition Nawaz Sharif, in response 
to his demand for a referendum on the setting up of permanent judicial 
commission for probing corruption charges, the President pointed out that 
the job could be done by the proposed select committees of the Parliament.
    
This is a second letter written to Nawaz Sharif by the President. In a 
previous letter written tow days ago, the President told the opposition 
leader that the government had started implementing the decision of the 
Supreme Court on the appointment of judges.
    
I am sure you will agree with my view that corruption is a national 
problem and the fight against corruption requires a non-partisan approach. 
If, therefore, I were to refer your proposal to a referendum it would 
politicise an issue which requires for its resolution the united efforts of 
not only the government and the opposition but of all the citizens of 
Pakistan, he said.
    
He said as he was writing the leader of the opposition he was 
simultaneously asking the prime minister to agree to set up select 
committees of the Senate and the National Assembly. I hope the majority 
coalition and the opposition along with all other members of the Parliament 
will co-operate in setting of the select committees, he added.
    
Mr Leghari expressed hopes that the government and the opposition will 
begin constructive changes through Parliament to manifest national unity on 
such issues as Kashmir, national security concerns, economic problems, the 
issue of women seats and any necessary amendments required in the 
Constitution.
    
We must not allow artificial politicisation of the issue of corruption. 
Neither will any meaningful resolution emerge from accusations and counter 
accusation. But we, the public representatives, will be failing in our duty 
if we try to ignore the issue or obfuscate it.
    
He also referred to the governments point of view on corruption and said 
that it (government) claimed to be alive and conscious of the menace of 
corruption and placed it high on its priorities for its eradication. The 
government is of the view that the constitution and law provides adequate 
mechanism for the process of accountability and that proposed judicial 
commission would hinder, and not aid, the fight against corruption, Mr 
Leghari said.

<a name="pres">President rings the alarm bells</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

PRESIDENT Farooq Leghari has spoken strongly on the fragile state of the 
economy and various malpractices for a second time within ten days. 
Evidently he has become so sensitive to the current economic conditions 
that he is hardly missing a significant opportunity to speak out.
    
He spoke on the parlous state of the economy and the visible failure of the 
ruling and owning classes at the Lahore Press Club, and returned to the 
subject with greater vehemence at the convocation of the National Defence 
College.
    
He laments that the countrys monetary policy is currently hostage to large 
budget deficits, inefficient and corrupt public sector banks and DFIs and 
vested interests determined to exploit the banking system. And he asserts 
that a system that required the political leadership to impose additional 
taxation simply to offset its own drag is not worth keeping. And he 
deplores the fact that despite heavy taxation we fail to achieve the 
deficit targets because the tax efforts are swallowed by an inefficient, 
corrupt or leaking system.
    
He has come up with a candid analysis of our fiscal and monetary maladies 
with which the public is in full agreement, but he has not suggested the 
requisite specific cures. He has very obviously shied away from suggesting 
expenditure cuts or other officially impalable remedies. Instead he has 
merely urged controlling government borrowing to reduce inflation.
    
The fact is that if the expenditure is not cut, and what is spent is not 
made very effective in the current budget as well as development outlay, 
the budget deficit would remain large and have awfully deleterious impact 
on the economy and the life of the people as a whole. And the expenditure 
cut has to begin right from the top, with the top people on whom a great 
deal is spent serving as models for the people and diligent monitors of the 
economy during the crisis years which are likely to last long. If not, the 
current expenditure will keep on leaping up, as it has been. It rose by Rs 
60 billion last year to Rs 353 billion and will rise by Rs 42 billion this 
year, as has been budgeted with additional taxation of Rs 41 billion, and 
the entire economy will be fouled up. And as the tax efforts fall short of 
the targets, as President Leghari has underscored, the government will 
print more currency notes for which a target of Rs 20 billion has been set, 
borrow more externally and internally, misuse the privation funds, and 
aggravate the inflation.

<a name="whyt">Why the rupee keeps tumbling</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

WHEN the Pakistan rupee crossed its 35-to-a-US dollar barrier as June was 
ending, and came down to 35.10 to a dollar on June 30, it marked the 
Pakistan currency shrinking to just below 10 per cent of its value from its 
peak of Rs 3.35 to a dollar in its hey day until 1953.
    
The real external value of the rupee comes down to under five per cent of 
the old dollar if the heavy inflation the US had suffered earlier is taken 
into account, and the fact the dollar depreciated by 75 per cent against 
the Japanese Yen and to a lesser extent against the German mark and Swiss 
franc is not lost sight of.
    
By now the rupee is Rs 2.73 below its official rate at Rs 35.10-to-a-dollar 
in the open market, and shows the shrinking value of the rupee and the 
direction in which the wind is blowing. It gives greater credence to the 
prediction that by the end of the year or early next year the rupee may be 
40-to-a- dollar.
    
In fact, following the same kind of drift, the Bangladesh currency is 41 
Taka-to-a-dollar and Sri Lankan rupee 54 to a dollar while the Indian rupee 
holds good at 34.99 to a dollar after going down further.
    
No wonder Pakistanis converted more of their rupees into dollars and kept 
them in their foreign exchange bank accounts last year. As a result as the 
countrys foreign exchange earnings and home remittances fell far below the 
target, resident Pakistanis placed $508 billion more in their bank 
accounts. And the foreign exchange projection is that the same will happen 
this year too. The government is pleased about it as it can make use of the 
dollars to raise its low foreign exchange reserve or meet its soaring 
external expenditure when the export performance is disappointing and home 
remittances are falling.
    
Of course, such steady and sustained devaluation of the rupee, 26 times 
last year inclusive of the 7 per cent devaluation of October 28 has not 
fulfilled the purpose for which it has been undertaken. It has neither 
increased the exports appreciably nor shrunk the imports, which it makes 
far more expensive. In spite of the devaluation of 11 to 12 per cent last 
year exports which were to rise by 14 per cent have risen by about six per 
cent only, and imports which were to rise by 10.4 per cent, rose to 16 per 
cent. And the imports rose despite the imposition of 10 per cent regulatory 
duty on all dutiable items and five per cent on others, except a few, 
although both the devaluation and enhanced duty made the imports far more 
costly.
    
Pakistan had the same experience in 1993 after the Nawaz Sharifs and Moeen 
Qureshis caretaker government had devalued the rupee by 10 per cent, in 
what was Described by the caretaker finance minister Babar Ali as a one-
time devaluation. Exports, instead of rising that year, fell by 2 per 
cent.
    
What is obvious is that neither the creeping devaluation of the rupee that 
we have tried since it was de-linked from the dollar in 1982 nor the large 
doses tried in 1993, nor the mixture of large and small devaluations have 
paid any dividend.
    
It may be argued that the other countries of South Asia have done likewise 
and the Indian rupee is almost on par with Pakistans. The fact, however, 
is that this is happening in a country which could make a spectacular 
success of its non- devaluation policy in 1949 which held good until 1953 
when the rupee was brought down to Rs 4.75 to dollar what is at issue is 
the quality of the economic management and leadership.
    
In fact, such sustained devaluation while not solving the basic problem of 
small and sluggish experts at a time when South Koreas exports have 
crossed the $100 billion mark, has created a host of problems across the 
economic spectrum. If inflates the cost of all imports and the import 
duties based on ad varolem. Sales tax rises further, and together makes 
investment far more expensive, rendering repayment of the foreign loans and 
now the increasing short-term foreign exchange loans are far more expensive 
in a country with an overwhelming debt burden.
    
Another major problem it is creating is that it spurs the farmlords to 
demand international prices in their rupee equivalent for their product, 
including cotton, wheat and other items imported by Pakistan to supplement 
indigenous production. They are already free to export their cotton at 
world prices without any of the old export duties and they want the same 
prices for wheat. The fact is that as the rupee gets more and more devalued 
the gap between the import prices of food items and the support prices, 
which are increased from time to time, widen and that spurs the demand of 
the farmlords for the latest international prices in rupee.
    
However, as long as inflation, which is acknowledged as the mother of many 
evils, and certainly of devaluation, continues the rupee will have to be 
devalued to keep even the existing level of exports going. Increases in 
support prices on an annual basis and sometimes more than once in a year, 
steep rise in the prices of power, gas, water, POL, higher taxation all-
round with the provincial governments and municipalities joining in to 
boost the levies, higher wages and the impermissibly high interest rates 
add to the inflation in Pakistan. Moreover, if devaluation increases the 
prices of imports, the higher cost of imported inputs in the export 
industries accelerate the inflation and devaluation further.
    
The fact, however, is that if we do not check the double menace, it will be 
a long time before the per-capita income becomes $500 per year, while we 
proudly say it is Rs 16,623, but with the fast-eroding Pak currency. 
   
And this is a symptom of distorted economic progress. The richer we seem to 
get, the poorer we actually are in dollar terms.

<a name="comi">Coming to grips with the electricity outage</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Wasful Hasan Siddiqui

PAKISTAN experienced the worst power crisis in the third quarter of 1994. 
Beside frequent prolonged breakdowns in most parts of the country, there 
was complete darkness one night in September 1994 all over the country.
    
The reason for non-supply of power was attributed to major breakdowns in 
the hydel power generating system which disturbed entire transmission 
system of the country. The failure of the hydel power projects in 
maintaining regular supply was stated to be drought due to which the water 
level in reservoirs touched an all-time low. In addition, shut-down of 
thermal units due to technical problems was responsible for a shortfall of 
electricity of about 3,750 MW against the total generation capacity of 
11,646 MW.
    
The standard to measure the progress and prosperity of the nation, 
individually and collectively, is the per-capita consumption of 
electricity. The higher the per-capita consumption of power, higher will be 
the standard of living of the nation.
    
The 1992 per-capita consumption of electricity for various countries and it 
is apparent that consumption in developing countries is very low compared 
to the developed industrialised nations. The former, such as Pakistan, may 
experience periods of rapid growth, as for example in the late 1980s, but 
to sustain this, an adequate and reliable electricity supply is essential.
    
Present installed capacity of power generation, both of WAPDA and KESC 
(KANUPP included) is not more than 11,646 Megawatts. 
    
There remains a demand and supply gap of 2000 MW in the peak months of low 
hydel inflow in December every year. Power is available to 40 percent of 
the population (30 percent urban and 10 percent rural). That means that 
agriculture which is the backbone of the economy and being the largest 
source of employment, which accommodates 52 per cent of the countrys 
labour force, gets very little electricity.
    
Power is one of the sources of energy of the total commercial energy supply 
in the country. Power accounts for 16 per cent.
    
Solar energy which is a cost-effective means of power can also be a source 
of continuous supply of electricity. It can be used for water pumping, 
lighting, fans and for other small electric appliances in remote areas 
where electricity from the national network can not be provided. Solar 
energy is however not yet fully developed for common use in Pakistan.
    
The total installed capacity in Pakistan is 11,646 megawatt out of which 
WAPDA shares 84 per cent whereas KESC (KANUPP AND PASMIC included) meet 16 
per cent of the demand.
    
With the commissioning of the new power projects totalling 10081 MW (US 
based Entrepreneurs: 3509 MW, Hong Kong-based Gordon Wu: 5280 MW and Hubco 
Power projects: 1292 MW), the power supply at the end of year 1997 will 
cross the figure of 21727 MW as subsequently more agreements with Hong Kong 
and South Koreans have also been signed. This power supply by all standards 
is still not sufficient to meet all our power requirements so as to bring 
our industrial growth at par with developing nations. There shall however 
remain a big gap in demand and supply of electricity at the turn of the 
century.
    
The total investment in power systems of expansion and development during 
the period 1981 to 1990 was US $ 6.000 billion approximately comprising US 
$ 2.900 billion in foreign exchange and US $ 3.100 billion in local 
currency. For the current decade, however, the total requirement is 
anticipated at US $ 17.500 billion, US $ 9.000 billion in foreign exchange 
and US $ 8.500 billion in local currency, which is equal to 3 times 
increase over the previous decade.
    
Against the international standards loss of 16 per cent the transmission 
and distribution losses in Pakistan are reported at more than 30 per cent 
of the total power generated. KESC suffered line losses more than 30 per 
cent in 1994 95 (27.30 per cent in 1992-93) The reasons attributed to the 
losses are as under:
    
i. Distribution network: Distribution network of WAPDA and KESC is not 
efficient. It needs major rehabilitation and augmentation.
    
ii. Theft: Unauthorised connections/kundas by the unscrupulous persons with 
the connivance of utilitys staff members is the main source of theft of 
electricity.

Sources of power generation
    
The additional power generation requires massive capital investment. This 
in turn will increase the demand for fuel resources and its handling. 
Therefore emphasis has to made on the selection of indigenous resources, 
wherever these are available. Based on this assumption, a suitable choice 
can be made out of the following projects:
    
i. Hydel power projects (both large and small).
    
ii. Thermal projects based on coal.
    
iii. Combined cycle thermal power projects based on low calorific value of 
gas.
    
iv. Co-generation power projects based on biomas (bagasse).
    
v. Power projects based on furnace oil.
    
Nature has gifted this small country with an parallel network of rivers and 
dames having hydel inflow from huge glaciers, water-falls and springs from 
the worlds highest mountainous range in the north, which maintains a 
regular hydel inflow in Indus water system and its tributaries. This 
natural advantage is a source of sufficient water which is more than 146.39 
MAF with a reservoir storage of 14.93 MAF and canal withdrawal of 104.63 
MAF. The rest is drained out in the sea. This natural source of water is 
sufficient to produce 40,000 MW (approximately) electricity at cheaper 
cost.
    
The price of electricity passed on to customers, besides profit element, 
contains two cost components i.e. an energy charge and demand charge. The 
energy components is related to consumption and reflects the Utilitys 
energy costs. Demand component is related to the capacity of the Utilitys 
generating plants, transmission lines and distribution equipment which 
carry energy to the users. The demand component reflects Utilitys capital 
costs.  Hence the need for DCM can be regarded as arising from:
    
i. Avoiding investment in power plant.
    
ii. Economical losses due to blackouts.
    
iii. Replacing future power plants.
 
iv. Help to environmental protection.
    
i). Demand measurement: By means of meters, the users demand is measured 
by the Utility organisation. the users can also employ the same source of 
data to analyses the electrical load at their plants.
    
ii). Daily demand profile: Peak demand or the average power that 
establishes the capacity of the Utilitys facility that is required by the 
user is defined as the average power represented by the two contiguous at 
fifteen minutes interval with the highest number of pulses over the period. 
    
iii). Practical demand analysis: Demand meter readings are available from 
the Utility as tape recorded, written recorded or real time data. This data 
may be entered into the system on the users premises and transmitted to a 
remotely situated time shared data processing service centre. There, the 
data is processed and the results are transmitted to the user, which it 
reports at the data terminal.
    
New energy policy: In view of the growing demand and in order to fill up 
the supply-demand gap of electricity, a new energy policy has been 
announced by the Government. A Rs 700 billion five-year plan has been 
launched to generate electricity from a rational mix of hydro-flows, gas, 
oil and Coal. The plan envisages investment of 330 billion rupees in the 
public sector and 370 billion rupees in the private sector.
    
The biggest incentive to the power companies is the pass-on option. It 
implies that a fluctuation in fuel prices and currency exchange variations 
will not be borne by these companies, as such increase in cost will be 
passed on to the consumers. Similarly, the tariff structure is dollar-
dominated formula which would act as a cushion against the depreciation of 
Pak Rupee. These measures are undoubtedly aimed at safeguarding the 
interest of the Power companies at the cost of the consumers.
    
The power purchase and fuel supply agreements were initiated for the 
projects, and would have now been already finalised. The projects are 
expected to start operations by late 1997.
    
AGRI-ELECTRIC Projects: Agri-electric Power Inc., of Louisiana have 
proposed to set up and construct a 10 MW power generation plant, using rice 
husk as fuel at Larkana District in the Sindh province.
    
KABIRWALA Power Project: Kabirwala power project is 14 MW combined cycle 
power station, using natural gas of low BTU and pipeline gas as fuel. It is 
located in District Khanewal in Punjab.
    
INVESTMENT FUNDS: Smith Barney and First Capital Securities are planning to 
launch a US$ 150 million Capital Energy and Power Development Fund, which 
will provide a portion of the senior debt financing required by a pre-
identified package of projects.
    
SEPCO Projects: Sepco is in the process of implementing an electric power 
generation project, with a capacity of 310 MW (210 MW simple and 100 MW 
combined cycle) with a total value of US$ 200 million.
    
UCH power project: The Uch power project is a 584 MW combined cycle power 
station, using low BTU gas from Uch gas field, to be located in the 
District Nasirabad, in Balochistan province. It is due for commissioning in 
October, 1997 and has an estimated total value of $ 600 million.
    
WAKGAS: The Wakgas power project is a 800 MW barge-mounted power station 
based on heavy-fuel oil diesel engine. The project is located at Port 
Qasim, in Sindh province, and is due for commissioning in September, 1996. 
The total estimated value of the project is $880 million.
    
POWER GEN. CORP. Projects: Synergics Energy Development, Inc., of Maryland, 
US and Power Gencorp Ltd., of Lahore, Pakistan have agreed to jointly 
develop, finance, design and construct and operate three hydroelectric 
power plants in the province of Punjab, totalling 75 MW in capacity at 
total value of $ 55 million.
    
Entech Inc. of Dallas, TX and Power Gencorp Ltd. of Lahore, Pakistan have 
signed an agreement to jointly develop solar power projects in Pakistan, 
including an initial project valued at more than $ 40 million.
    
Hong Kong based Gordon S.Y. Wu (power projects of 5280 MW = $ 7.7 billion).
    
Gordon Y.S. Wu, of Hopwell Holdings (Pvt.) Ltd., has started setting up 
eight coal-fired projects of 660 MW each from Karachi to Gadani. 

Environmental Hazards
    
Under the MOU signed with Hong Kong based Power tycoon Gordon WU, coal 
fired eight power projects of 880 MW each will be located at the coast of 
Arabian Sea around Karachi.
    
Power Generation projects likely to come up around Karachi will add 1,850 
tons of sulphur dioxide per day into the already polluted city environment.
    
The existing power generation plants emit an estimated 600 tons of sulphur 
dioxide into Karachi atmosphere per day.
    
According to recently prepared report on Karachi atmosphere, the city is 
already under threat of extreme pollution level. At present, different 
types of vehicles, steel mills, oil refineries, industrial units, aircraft, 
railway engines, ships, use of as for cooking, use of air conditioners and 
burning of wastes emit about 1,500 tons of sulphur dioxide and over two 
tons of toxic material in the air per day.
    
The report further estimates that the city will have over 4000 tons of 
sulphur dioxide and five tons of toxic material added to the air per days 
as and when all the power generation project based on oil and gas come on 
line, as well as the population grows by a million, and the number of 
industrial units and vehicles goes up.
    
In addition to this, the thermal power plants will produce a certain amount 
of carbon and nitrogen oxide through fuel burning process.
    
The report says that only waste burning in the city produces about 1,074 
tons of nitrogen oxide per day.
    
The report expresses fear that Karachi might experience acidic rains in 
future as sulphur dioxide mixed with water, rain or dew, produces sulphuric 
acid.
    
Such rainfall has proved to be a bane for Northern countries, affecting the 
acid content of soil and water bodies, and pitting the surface of stone and 
marble facades of old buildings. The worst hit will be the vegetation that 
helps to reduce the carbon dioxide content of the air.
    
The report mentions that fuel oil, currently available in the market, 
contains 3.5 per cent sulphur and when the oil burns its emissions contain 
7 per cent sulphur dioxide.
    
In the fuel oil, the total concentration of metals, such as cadmium, 
nickel, vanadium and beryllium is over 100 parts per million (PPM). This 
would mean that a plant burning one million tons fuel oil will release some 
100 tons of toxic material, the report calculates.
    
The report indicates that seven fuel oil-fired power generation plants are 
planned to be set up, including a 600 MW in North Karachi, a 196 MW at 
Mauripur, a 125 MW in Korangi Town, a 288 MW in Korangi Creek, an 800 MW 
near Port Qasim and a 463 MW gas fired plant at Manora Island. These 
proposed plants are in addition to the current ones at Hawkes Bay, Ibrahim 
Hyderi, Korangi and two at Port Qasim.
    
In the opinion of the renowned Environmentalists, Karachi is a highly 
polluted city which is estimated to have 832,966 Vehicles. Bin Qasim Power 
plants, oil refineries and many industrial units which are a sources of 
immense pollution and health problems. Present source of pollution are as 
under:
    
The hot water discharged from WAK GAS Generators and salt released from 
water purification plants will destroy the marine life under sea water. The 
destruction of mangroves will release the silt from their roots which will 
block the creeks and water paths thus making them unsuitable for ship 
movements.
    
Acid rain: Karachi gets annual fall of dew between 25-30 mm which is a 
source of life to grass and green plants. The dew will be heavily polluted 
which may cause damage to the grass and vegetation.
    
Hydel power policy: Realising the need of hydel Power and its cost-
effectiveness, the Governments has decided to formulate a hydel power 
policy to attract private participation for hydel power generation in 
Pakistan.
    
Power Regulatory authority for power sector: In 1994 Federal Cabinet had 
approved the establishment of National Electric Power Regulatory Authority 
(NEPRA) to oversee and regulate generation, transmission and distribution 
of electricity in the private sector.

<a name="5%cv">5% CVT to be levied on 1500sq ft apartments</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 14: Capital Value Tax (CVT) at the rate of 5 per cent will 
also be charged on the purchase of flats and apartments having a covered 
area of 1500 square feet or more.
    
However, the Finance Act 1996, while giving exemption from the levy of CVT 
to a residential plot having an area up to 240 square yards and a flat or 
apartment with covered area less than 1500 square feet, it has levied 5% 
CVT on purchase of all other urban properties.
    
Until last year, CVT was not being charged on urban immovable property if 
land area was only up to 240 square yards. After changes brought about in 
the Finance Act 1996, in Section 7 of the Finance Act, 1989, CVT will now 
be charged on the purchase of flats or apartments, if covered area is 1500 
square feet or more.
    
The act stipulates that immovable property other than residential plots of 
land with an area up to 240 square yards and flats and apartments with 
covered area less than 1500 square feet situated in urban area will fall 
under the levy of 5% CVT.
    
While defining the urban area, the Finance Act 1996, envisages that area 
falling within the limits of metropolitan corporation, municipal 
corporation, municipal committee, town committee, cantonment board or the 
Islamabad Capital Territory.
    
It is for the first that the CVT has been extended to rural areas also, as 
it will now be charged at 5% on the purchase of agricultural land. However, 
this would be chargeable in case the value of such agricultural land was Rs 
200,000 or more.

<a name="gstm">GST may be charged at 18pc, says CBR </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, July 14: The Central Board of Revenue (CBR) would start 
collecting General Sales Tax (GST) at the original 18 per cent rate in case 
it felt difficulties to meet the revenue targets during 1996-97.
    
The GST which has been brought down from 18 to 10 per cent after offering 
concessions and exemptions to the FPCCI will be revised again to 18 per 
cent if we could not realise our revenue targets, declared Chairman CBR 
Mr. Alvi Abdul Rahim.
    
Speaking at a Press conference he, however, insisted that his department 
will be able to collect required level of taxes through GST despite 
exemptions and concessions extended to the business community.
    
These exemptions relate to textiles, garments, hand made carpets, surgical 
equipment and sport goods. Asked whether the IMF has toughened its stand 
against these exemptions, he said, he has never been a member of the 
governments negotiating team to conduct talks with the Fund therefore he 
could not say anything about it.
    
The Chairman CBR for the first time admitted that there has been a 
consistent problem to address the issue of manipulation of figures or 
doctoring of figures. I would not personally call it a doctoring of 
figures or manipulation of estimates but I admit that there have always 
been differences between the CBR and the Auditor General over the figures 
of revenue collection.
    
When reminded that the prime minister has also taken a note of the issue by 
saying that she too was informed that the CBR doctored figures and that she 
has asked the Auditor General (AG) to investigate the issue, Mr. Alvi said 
he would not comment on it as he was not present on the occasion when Ms. 
Bhutto made these observations.

<a name="nati">National Discounting Services launched</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 15: National Bank of Pakistan formally launched National 
Discounting Services Limited (NDSL), a wholly owned subsidiary, from the 
floor of the KSE.
    
The Chairman of the company, Mr.M.B.Abbasi said that NDSL had been formed 
on the basis of a thorough study conducted by Bear Sterns Jehangir Siddiqui 
Ltd in collaboration with KPMG Peat Marwick. Mr Abbasi observed that the 
company would provide financing through discounting and the objective was 
to provide better utilisation of idle current assets on flexible terms and 
conditions, catering to the liquidity requirement of clients. He stated 
that the setting up of NDSL would promote the secondary market in which our 
country lags far behind.
    
Corporate sector, Mr Abbasi said, was still in its infancy with all 
emphasis on the primary market. The highly developed financial centres 
(such as New York, London, Paris, Tokyo and Hong Kong), he said, had very 
well developed and sophisticated secondary markets which worked to further 
reinforce the primary market and the stock exchanges in those countries.
    
The growth of financial markets, he said, was critically dependent on the 
development of secondary market. He observed that the WAPDA and other bonds 
could not succeed because of the absence of a secondary market where the 
bond holder could discount his holding.

ISLAMABAD, July 15: The federal government announced the Trade Policy for 
1996-97, that aimed at doing away with host of NOCs, offering substantial 
incentives to the exporters including the removal of condition for 
obtaining authorisation for the re-export of imported goods, and the 
permission to private sector to export cement.
    
This is going to be the last Trade Policy being announced by the 
government because from today the exporters would not have to seek 
permission for various things from the Ministry of Commerce, said Chaudhry 
Ahmad Mukhtar.
    
The Commerce Minister told Dawn before going to Television Station for 
recording his speech that the PPP government in his third Trade Policy has 
virtually removed all restrictions that were hampering the countrys 
exports and disturbing the exporters.
    
Todays Trade Policy marks the beginning of no more governments controls, 
virtually no more controls and the practice of announcing Trade Policy 
every year has now ended for ever, he declared. Every thing has been de-
regulated.

<a name="ksei">KSE index breaks 1,600-point barriers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, July 17: Stocks were in a terribly bad shape as sellers appeared 
to be in a bit haste to get out of the market disappointed apparently by 
the political uncertainty.
    
The KSE 100-share price index breached the psychological barrier of 1,600 
points for the first time during the last six months and it could be 
beginning of a great retreat in the coming sessions.
    
It was last quoted at 1,592.02 as compared to 1,615.25 a day earlier, 
reflecting the weakness of the base shares.

It was not a single negative factor but a combination of bearish news, 
which are not allowing the technical factors to play their due role and the 
bad thing is that there are no signs of recovery.

They said the selling was not that alarming but what weighed heavily 
against the sentiment was slack demand and investor apathy.
    
The market is the victim of slack demand rather than any other single 
negative factor and until investors are back in the rings there is a remote 
possibility of a turnaround, they added.
    
The interesting feature was that bulk of the selling was directed against 
blue chips, which fell in unison notably in the chemical and pharma sector 
as most of the MNCs are stilling ruling at the higher prices.
    
PSO, Shell Pakistan, HinoPak Motors, and Fauji Fertiliser, therefore, led 
the list of leading losers, falling by Rs 1.75 to 3, biggest decline being 
in the KESC, which fell sharply as a section of investors took profits at 
the available margin. Brooke Bond followed them, falling by Rs 1.25.
    
Among the locals, Askari Leasing, 8th ICP, Faysal Bank, Gulistan Textiles, 
Sana Industries, and Searle Pakistan were leading losers, which suffered 
decline ranging from one rupee to Rs 3.
    
Fourth ICP Mutual Fund also attracted large selling from some genuine 
investors and was marked down by Rs 22 on a turnover or only 500 shares.
    
Most of the leading shares fell in unison but some of the second-liners and 
blue chips managed to finish modestly higher on stray support under the 
lead of 13th ICP, Attock Refinery, Ados Pakistan, Knoll Pharma and 
Mitchells Fruits, which rose by one rupee to Rs 1.5.
    
The newly listed Commercial Union Assurance was, however, an exception, 
which remained in strong demand apparently from some of the London-based 
foreign funds and was quoted further higher by Rs 2.05 on a large business.
    
On the corporate front, the board of directors of Khyber Tobacco has 
announced a cash dividend at the rate of five percent for the year ended 
June 30, 1996.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, easy 60 paisa on 6.704m 
shares, Hub-Power, off 80 paisa on 4.272m, Commercial Union Assurance, 
higher Rs 2.05 on 1.372m, Sui Southern, lower 60 paisa on 0.483m, ICI 
Pakistan, easy 15 paisa on 0.394m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Dewan Salman, off 50 paisa on 
0.328m, Dhan Fibre, lower 15 paisa on 0.398m, KESC, off Rs 4 on 0.171m, 
Schon Modaraba, up 10 paisa on 0.151m and Lucky Cement, steady 10 paisa on 
0.140m shares.
    
Trading volume rose to 19.724m shares from the previous 15.792m shares 
owing to large activity in PTC vouchers.
    
There were 348 actives, out of which 194 shares suffered fall, while 68 
rose, with 86 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="thej">The judiciary triumphs-V</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

IT HAS so often happened during the course of history  a head of state or 
government appoints a general or a judge thinking the appointee to be a 
creeping invertebrate that will unquestionably do his bidding, and then 
surprisingly the man shows his spine, sticks up for his cause, and stands 
erect.
    
One famous case is that of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858- 1919) and 
Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr (1841-1935). Holmes, a Weld Professor at the 
Harvard Law School, was appointed to the Bench of the Supreme Judicial 
Court of the State of Massachusetts in 1882. In 1899 he was appointed its 
Chief Justice. Misjudging him, taking him to be docile and spineless, Teddy 
Roosevelt elevated him to the US Supreme Court in 1902.
    
Shortly thereafter came a case in which an order of the President was 
challenged. The majority decided in favour of the President, Holmes was the 
sole dissenter. An angry Roosevelt, disappointed with his choice, publicly 
exclaimed: I can carve out of a banana a judge with more backbone than 
that. When the remark was repeated to Holmes at a party at the White 
House, all that he had to say to the politicians around him was: What else 
can you expect from a shallow intellect? What you and the President want is 
not justice, but favour. And when I am sitting on the Bench, I dont give a 
damn as to what you and the President want.
    
Roosevelt was a big man. He extended his hand and thereafter the two got 
along famously. Holmes, known as The Great Dissenter because of the 
brilliance of his dissenting opinions, retired from the Supreme Court just 
before his 91st birthday. It was Holmes who stated the concept of clear 
and present danger as the only basis for limiting free speech. Holmes was 
a bigger man.
    
Now to home ground and to the recent burgeoning of the full and conscious 
independence of our judiciary. The government was getting away with murder. 
What the Press euphemistically refers to as our leadership expected the 
Chief Justice of Pakistan to conduct himself like an SHO (as wrote the 
Chaudhry of Chakwal) and when he did not, its response was worthy of a 
neighbourhood tough. The judges and their families were harassed.
    
During the pendency of the judges case the house of the Chief Justices 
daughter was raided, his civil servant son-in-law Syed Parvez Ali Shah was 
suspended. After the short order was handed down, the CJs crested Karachi 
car was hijacked, its driver thrown on to the road and told that the toughs 
knew whose car it was and that the owner would be equally drastically dealt 
with. The CJs telephones have been tapped, his offices and houses bugged. 
The government went to great lengths to try to have him denotified by the 
competent authority. Later, death threats were delivered.
    
One former judge has already been killed. That vociferous supporter of the 
independence of the judiciary, Nizam Ahmed (together with his son) was shot 
down in broad daylight in Karachi outside his home. The message thus sent 
makes death threats ominous.
    
Nizams murderers have, of course, not been found. The authorities 
investigating the murder have established that at the time of his death 
Nizam was Nawaz Sharifs counsel in three defamation suits filed against 
him: Civil Suit 632/93, filed in the Sindh High Court by MNA Asif Zardari 
claiming Rs 5 crores (lawyers, S. Salimuddin and Nafis Usmani); CS 637/93, 
filed in the SHC by Qaim Ali Shah claiming Rs 1 crore (filed by Barrister 
Kamaluddin Azfar); and CS 638/93 filed by stalwart Ghulam Kadir Palejo also 
claiming Rs 1 crore (lawyer, Nafis Usmani).
    
Nizam had also taken over as counsel (the original counsel Shamshad Lari 
having died) in a case involving an 8,000 sq yd prime plot of land, right 
next to the Awami Markaz on Sharea Faisal, originally reserved by the KDA 
as a parking lot. Pressure was exerted, and the KDA sold the plot to a 
nominee of a palace favourite at the throwaway price of Rs 2.5 crores as 
against an approximate market value of some Rs 30 crores.
    
A public interest constitutional petition was filed against the sale, a 
stay was granted by a division Bench of the SHC headed by Justice 
Wajihuddin Ahmad. Two other lawyers, Abdul Hafiz Lakho and Raja Qureshi, 
then stepped in for the defendants, the case was transferred to another 
Division Bench, comprising Justices Abdul Latif Qureshi and Ali Mohammed 
Baloch which, without giving Nizam an opportunity to file a counter-
affidavit, discharged the stay order. Nizm was preparing an appeal to the 
Supreme Court.
    
Nasir Aslam Zahid, Chief Justice of the High Court of Sindh, in 1994 was 
punished and sent to the Federal Shariat Court. That not being considered 
sufficient reprisal for his sins, his wife, a physician working at the PIA 
medical centre in Karachi, was transferred to the outpost centre at 
besieged, riot-torn Korangi. She stuck it out for two years. She was 
recently brought back to base, from where she has now retired. Her dues 
have not been paid. Some well-wishers have made noises and offered to act 
as a bridge between her husband and the executive. She has since been asked 
to work on a contract basis, has obliged, but is not being paid. Her pay 
slip mentions her salary: Rs.00.00.
    
Justice Zahids son-in-law, an officer of UBL in Abu Dhabi, was suddenly 
transferred back to Pakistan, and asked to vacate his house on 24 hours 
notice. He has managed to fend for himself.
    
Justice Fazal Elahi of the Supreme Court, who sat on the Bench hearing the 
judges case, was another victim. His son, a civil judge in the NWFP, 
suddenly found himself transferred to Booni, an outpost in Mastuj district 
of Chitral.
    
Where is Booni? A plane lands at Chitral town, weather permitting, 
sometimes after a lapse of a month. To reach Booni, some 60 miles away, one 
mounts a horse, advances at a walk along a steep and narrow path, travels 
for four days, and, horse permitting, one arrives. Booni is at 36.15N 
parallel, close to Tirich Mir in the Karakoram, the mountain that rises 
above 25,000 feet.
    
The harassment continues. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shahs son- in-law, 
Parvez Ali Shah, remains suspended, his petition filed in the SHC remains 
unheard. During the hearing of the governments review petition in the 
judges case, efforts were made to deprive him of his official car and 
residential telephone. The CJs other son-in-law, Syed Mehdi Ali Shah, who 
has just completed his pre- service training at the Peshawar Academy, has 
been posted as Assistant Commissioner under training and SDM at Mitthi, 
surrounded by dunes, deep in the Thar desert. To get to Mitthi, one can 
motor up to Naukot, whereafter the journey has to be completed in a four-
wheel-drive vehicle.
    
Further trouble for Mehdi Ali Shahs family. His brother, another 
government officer, Syed Mustapha Ali Shah, lives with their mother in a 
government house in Karachi. He was served with a notice on July 3 to 
vacate the house within seven days. A petition was filed in the High Court 
and the ejectment notice was then withdrawn on July 8.
    
The infantile thinking of our competent authorities is truly beyond 
belief. But they cannot and will not grow up. Do they themselves really 
believe that their wanton acts and stupidity can benefit them? Fortunately 
they help us, as it firms the resolve of the judges and others who are 
subject to their whims, it encourages them to fight on and to persevere.
    
Nothing changes. In 1954, forty-two years ago, when the One Unit issue was 
to be voted upon in the provincial assembly, the then chief minister, 
Mohammed Ayub Khuhro, in cahoots with his minister Pir Ali Mohammed Rashdi, 
realising that the honourable Mirs of Talpur would vote against their 
proposal, acted. Mir Ali Ahmed Talpur was arrested on a trumped-up charge, 
Mir Rasul Bakhsh Talpur managed to escape and hide, and the smallest and 
gentlest of the three, Mir Ghulam Ali Talpur, was bodily picked up and 
bundled off on the back of a camel to Mitthi, the same old Mitthi in the 
Thar desert.
    
Reverting to the review petition in the judges case, the government could 
only depend on that strong leader, Cambridge Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan. Rather 
than produce the records, which would be fatal, the government chose to 
withdraw. He said Government implementing Supreme Court judgement  
Leghari. Our judges can hold their heads high.

ISLAMABAD: Justice Javed Iqbal has been called many things. As a sitting 
judge, he was Noora by an infuriated Ghulam Gilani Malik, and then having 
been sworn in as a senator on PML ticket, his own party members called him 
a disappointment. Arguably he has contributed far less in way of articulate 
speeches or thought- provoking legalistic interpretations than was expected 
of him. But on Tuesday, the son of Allama Iqbal spoke after a long time, 
and spoke well.
    
Taking part in the ongoing debate regarding the future of the federal 
parliamentary democratic system, Javed Iqbal lamented about certain 
impressions that may not necessarily be true but nevertheless harbour 
disturbing consequences for the system itself. The press has gone hoarse 
crying about the governments non-chalant attitude towards the fact that in 
politics perceptions are far more important than reality. His conclusion 
was precise and brief like a judges short order. He perceived the 
government as being the biggest threat to the system with mid-term 
elections offering the only way out of this crisis. Any government 
supporter would naturally fling aside this demand but a genuine government 
sympathiser would strain his grey matter to ponder the arguments cited by 
the former high court judge. Most of them made sense, some of them 
suggested an alarming scenario.
    
Talking about Article 6, pertaining to treason, he argued that it was not 
confined to abrogation of the Constitution but also included acts of 
subverting the document. In his opinion, many actions of the government 
qualified in this category. Could it be that the government had attempted 
to sabotage the Constitution by defying the constitutional independence of 
the supreme judiciary by not imposing its writ. The government may not have 
refused to obey the court but has yet to prove otherwise. It was a former 
chief justice of the American Supreme Court who once said: We are 
subservient to the Constitution but Constitution is what we interpret it to 
be. The government would be wise to remember this.
    
Hammering on the perception theme, Javed Iqbal said he wasnt aware of why 
the Lahore High Court had suspended the Wattoo case hearings despite a 
Supreme Court directive of wrapping up the case before the summer holidays. 
Unknown to Javed Iqbal, however, Islamabad circles are attributing this 
suspension as a sign of a rapprochement between Chief Justice Sajjad Ali 
Shah and the government. One senior PML leader pointed out that the other 
tell-tale sign could well be the hearing date set for Begum Nasim Wali 
Khans petition on the Mehrangate affair.
    
The sooner the date, the greater the tension and vice versa, was the cited 
logic.
    
Coming back to Javed Iqbal made observations regarding the use, rather 
abuse, of constitutional provisions in the federal governments intrusion 
into provincial autonomy. The manner in which the government had 
orchestrated the legal, yet unethical, ouster of the Sabir Shah and Wattoo 
governments does tend to augment his criticism. The government has 
persistently defended its actions on legal grounds but in all seriousness 
is legality the only touchstone of good governance?. Is it not equally 
important for a government to appear equally moral and ethical as well.

<a name="thea">The answer is blowing in the wind</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

THE one common theme in history is our predilection for organised violence. 
Warfare has driven human progress in an incessant cycle of gore and glory.
    
But while history books and the biographies of kings and generals describe 
and glorify past battles and campaigns, few chroniclers tell us about the 
suffering of the foot soldiers, the devastation caused by armies and the 
pain of families deprived of husbands, sons, husbands and lovers. For 
posterity, only the joy of victory and the hubris of the victors remain: 
all else  death, defeat and dishonour  are buried in collective graves 
with the dead.
    
Perhaps it is this selective memory that propels each generation of young 
men to seek fame and fortune through the profession of arms: whenever 
jingoists and tubthumping politicians climb on the bandwagon and summon 
their nation to war there is never any shortage of volunteers. Religion, 
honour, territory and imagined slights have all triggered off bloody 
conflicts, even a soccer game has caused a war. But despite the lessons of 
history, when the war-drums beat and the banner of national honour is 
raised, few resist the call to arms.
    
In Pakistan, past campaigns of the 1948 and 1965 wars have been endlessly 
and passionately described and romanticised. While the exploits of the 
heroes of these conflicts are taught to every schoolboy, the death and 
destruction caused by these wars  although very limited by modern 
standards  are glossed over. It goes without saying that the lessons of 
the 1971 war are taught neither in schools nor in our military academies. 
Although it is the best teacher, defeat seldom makes for edifying reading.
    
After the shattering military and political reverses of 1971 as well as the 
sweeping geopolitical changes that have taken place in the last quarter 
century, the entire balance of power in South Asia has undergone a sea 
change. For starters, India now enjoys a preponderant and overwhelming 
qualitative and quantitative military advantage over Pakistan; its economy 
is far larger and more diversified, and thus able to support a 
sophisticated defence industry; and perhaps most crucially, it is training 
tens of thousands of engineers and scientists every year. And although the 
collapse of the Soviet Union has cost it an important ally, it has improved 
its relations with the United States. On the other hand, we can no longer 
expect the same degree of unstinted support from China and Iran that our 
planners had earlier factored into their war games. The Americans have 
clearly distanced themselves from us after the exit of Soviet forces from 
Afghanistan.
    
All these factors underline our increasing isolation and a proportionate 
tilt in the power equation between India and Pakistan. Our nuclear 
programme keeps an uneasy balance, but in the absence of tests and a proven 
delivery system, this is not a very credible deterrent. As long as 
relations between the two countries remain tense, and weak governments 
remain hostage to their own rhetoric and the hysteria they have themselves 
whipped up, the chances of a bloody and costly war are uncomfortably high. 
But this time around, given the technological advances made in the last two 
decades, the level of destruction will be unprecedented, even without 
recourse to nuclear weapons. Think of Iraq after the Gulf War.
    
Mercifully, there are still sensible people on both sides of the border who 
are convinced that we must de-escalate and come to some kind of agreement 
over Kashmir. I have discussed the Kashmir issue in this space before, but 
what has changed drastically during this period is the nature and 
composition of the Indian government. The new Prime Minister is from the 
South, and has no emotional tie with the Valley; in Inder Gujral, India has 
a foreign minister who has repeatedly argued for better relations with 
Pakistan. Granted, a large country like India does not change its policies 
and long-held positions overnight with a change in government, but I 
believe there is window of opportunity that we must exploit.
    
For a start, we must step back from our maximalist, all-or- nothing 
position. Nobody is going to hand over Kashmir to us on a platter, and 
whatever the hawks in and out of the army may think, we cannot wrest it 
from India by force of arms. This is an unpalatable fact of life 
politicians and military planners must come to terms with. Basically, we 
must decide who and what we are really concerned with: the Kashmiri people, 
or the territory of Kashmir. If we care about the former, then we should be 
doing something about ending the bloodshed and the Indian occupation. Since 
we can do neither by force, we have to negotiate. So far, India has taken 
the position that since the events in the Valley are an internal problem, 
it will not discuss them with anybody else. It is time India got off its 
high horse as well.
    
Clearly, both sides will have to show more flexibility and imagination if 
an acceptable solution to all three parties to the conflict is to be found. 
Whether we like it or not, the UN resolutions of 1948 have lost much of 
their force: apart from lip-service from a few friends, no major player in 
the comity of nations thinks they are workable or enforceable. So instead 
of flogging a dead horse, we have to take a fresh approach. There are a 
number of plans and possible solutions that have been floated from time to 
time, but have been stillborn because of obduracy on both sides of the 
border. But perhaps the time has come to dust them off and let somebody 
mediate between the India and Pakistan. So far, the former has shot down 
any such offer, but with the recent change in government, perhaps a behind-
the-scenes initiative can work.
    
Next year, both countries will celebrate 50 years of independence. it would 
be a fitting anniversary gift to the people of the region if an end to the 
permanent state of hostilities could be negotiated. The prospect of trade 
is a good beginning, and the recent exchange of letters between the two 
prime ministers is an excellent prospect. Even more encouraging is the 
recent offer of talks at any level from the Indian Foreign Minister. All 
these suggest that the leaders of both countries are conscious of the need 
to step back from the brink, and establish normal relations.

<a name="thed">The dilemma of Pakistani youth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikramul Haq

EVERY society tends to ignore its more troublesome characteristics. Most 
often they are taken for granted because their recognition would be painful 
for those who want to maintain the status quo.
    
There is nothing surprising, then, if the rulers in this country show 
little concern when their actions subject the citizens to the greatest 
psychological strains. This indifference is usually disguised by a kind of 
rhetoric, which prevents real understanding of the situation.
    
Against this background let us look at the problems of the youth in 
Pakistan. From different platforms on the Youth Day, young men and women 
are told that they live in a God-given country, achieved in the name of 
Islam after sacrificing thousands of lives in a long struggle against the 
infidels. Having been reminded of this fact, they are called upon to 
sacrifice their lives for the defence of the ideological frontiers of the 
state. From these quarters efforts are being made to convince the youth 
that because of the great sacrifices of their elders they live amidst 
unprecedented new opportunities that could have never come their way in an 
undivided India. The purpose of all this is very clear: to leave the youth 
with the illusory conviction that the mere fact of achieving independence 
is sufficient to prevent them from thinking what happened in this country 
after 1947.
    
Knowing fully well the emptiness of such sermonising, the youth draws its 
own conclusions about the social realities on the basis of its daily 
experiences. However, in shaping the overall behaviour of the youth, 
political oppression of the past four decades has played the most 
significant role. A Pakistani hardly 45 years old has, in such a short 
period of his life, witnessed two horrible wars, three martial laws, 
political torture of the crudest form, mass imprisonment, victimisations of 
people in the name of religion, sectarian and ethnic clashes, and, the most 
painful of all, public and political hangings. All this has inculcated in 
him the deepest sense of cynicism. Cynicism is the key word to explain the 
general attitude of our youth towards life. For them the only reality of 
life is an endless struggle for adjustment with a system based on 
oppression, inequality and injustice. Their cynicism is, thus, totally 
justified.
    
To have grown up in families where unquestionable obedience to parents 
(authority) is expected, money and power are the most cherished values, 
caste and creed have been very important issues and sect and ethnic 
affiliations are considered a sacred theme. The young people have seen at 
least one thing: the obvious contradiction between principle and practice 
of the elders. This has led to what can be termed as institutionalisation 
of hypocrisy. The gap between values and actual practice is accepted as a 
fundamental truth of life. The Pakistani youth faces a number of problems 
like unemployment, deteriorating academic standards, political violence on 
the campuses, pressures of rigid family system and alienation. But like 
other sections of society, the youth, too, is divided: some of them are 
defenders of the present system, others oppose it and aspire for a change.
    
The youths revolt or organised opposition against the established system, 
as we have witnessed in the West during the 1960s, is almost non-existent 
in our society. But, of course, it is understandable that in our peculiar 
political conditions it has been very difficult to organise students and 
other young people as an effective political force. Nobody has tried to use 
their potential for bringing about a change in society, although they 
displayed their strength and importance during the campaign against the 
Ayub government. That was a spontaneous reaction, not a planned one.
    
In our present-day reality, the most disturbing aspect of the youths 
behaviour is the growing use of narcotics, especially heroin. This 
phenomenon cannot be viewed in isolation from the existing socio-political 
and economic realities. The concern shown by official quarters always tends 
to ignore the relationship between drug abuse and the existing social 
pressures. The end result is the exaggeration, misconception and 
misunderstanding of the entire problem. Instead of looking into the factors 
behind drug addiction, the authorities are busy showing their concern over 
rapid increase in the number of addicts every year.
    
Twelve years ago, on the new years eve, a journalist friend wrote: 
Nineteen eighty-four is here. And the people have a choice. If they have 
no raison detre, why dont they smoke heroin instead? The same is true, I 
think, in 1996. Who is responsible for the heroinisation of Pakistan? 
Thank God, the authorities have failed to see any foreign hand in this 
entirely self-created problem.
    
The national survey on drug addiction, carried out by the Pakistan 
Narcotics Control Board, estimates the rate of drug addiction in the 
country at over 15 per cent among the youth. In 1995, the total number of 
addicts in the country was 3.01 million, and the rate of increase is said 
to be 40,000 per year. The most disturbing fact revealed by the survey was 
the growing number of heroin addicts in the country with the average age of 
users falling below 24. According to a conservative estimate, there are 
over 1.52 million heroin addicts in Pakistan.
    
A survey of 10 colleges and two universities of Lahore, conducted by this 
writer in 1995, showed some horrible facts related to drug abuse among 
students. According to the survey, the majority of students surveyed (67%) 
reported using one or more drugs. This and many other surveys clearly show 
the rising number of young drug addicts in the country. A number of 
research studies done in Western countries associated drug experimentation 
with the failure of the education system to address the needs of the young 
for personal identity, self-esteem and social competence.
    
The important question is: how much is drug use related to our value 
system? In our society the growth of drug use among the youth is a 
manifestation of non-conformity and a quest for self- expression in a 
social set-up which has little to offer them. They are victims of the 
authoritarian attitudes of parents and teachers, are resentful of social 
restraints and above all, lack of love and affection. Then, nobody is 
willing to understand their problems sympathetically.
    
Rejection of the unfortunate addict, juvenile delinquent and dissident 
young person is an easy escape from collective responsibility. Those who 
control the existing institutions and matter in the land must realise that 
the young people detest the prevailing set-up because they observe and know 
how much cruelty and stupidity contribute to the strengthening of this 
oppressive system. These young people no longer want to be a part of this 
oppression and cruelty. A majority of them have no alternative.

<a name="arec">A recipe for civil strife</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

OF all the hatchet jobs being performed on this unfortunate country by a 
government which has lost all touch with reality, none is more sinister in 
its intentions, or more explosive in its potential consequences, than the 
recent amendment in the income tax law which permits  incredible as it 
sounds  private parties to assess and then collect income tax.
    
The relevant portion of the amendment reads as follows: ...the Central 
Board of Revenue, may with the prior approval of the Federal Government, 
appoint any private agency to exercise the functions and powers, including 
assessment of income and collection of taxes, of any income tax authority 
subordinate to it in respect of such persons or classes of persons, incomes 
or classes of incomes, cases or classes of cases or such areas as may be 
assigned to it...
    
Talk of entering the 21st century or vaulting into the ranks of the Asian 
tigers. By this one measure, thrust at the last minute (and surreptitiously 
at that) into the Finance Bill 1996, a hundred and fifty years of history 
has been put into reverse gear, with the Republic at one stroke being 
hurled back into the times of Maharaja Ranjit Singh when the revenue of 
various districts used to be farmed out to private individuals. 
Admittedly, the sins of the people of this country are many, none in this 
respect being greater than the unholy tolerance they have always shown for 
the most corrupt regimes. Even so, nothing that they have done stands up to 
the iniquity of this measure.
    
What does this amendment imply? Simply this that the federal government can 
designate any area in the country  town or district  where the income tax 
will be assessed and later collected by a private party, not on the basis 
of any set principles but purely on the strength of what that private party 
can squeeze from every assessee. Out of the total revenue farmed in this 
manner, the assessing and collecting agency will collect a fixed 
percentage, which, according to some newspaper reports, is as high as 15 
per cent. Will this not open the floodgates of arbitrariness?
    
Just imagine the scene. A private party, backed up by the strength of 
prohibited bore weaponry, descending upon shops, markets and warehouses and 
using terror and extortion as instruments of tax assessment. This is the Al 
Capone principle dressed up in the finery of the law (for whether this 
measure is immediately implemented or not, after its passage by the 
National Assembly it now stands as the law of the land). The higher the 
assessment, the greater the percentage of the collecting agency. Qabza 
groups and land mafias already pose a serious threat to the rule of law in 
the Islamic Republic. Imagine a qabza group as the highest taxation 
authority in any given area of the country.
    
It is the British who should have imposed such an arbitrary order on a 
conquered territory. But the British gave us laws based on equity and 
justice. At every step in the income tax laws which exist, and which this 
government has tried to subvert through its latest amendment, the interests 
of the citizen and the taxpayer are protected against arbitrariness. Tax 
assessment is not a whimsical exercise. It has to be based on proof and 
documentation. Even after an assessment is finalised, the assessee has two 
rights of appeal within the income tax system and two further stages of 
appeal, if a question of law arises, resting with the high courts and the 
Supreme Court. Lengthy though this procedure may be, its aim is to balance 
the legitimate interest of the state to collect revenue with the interest 
of the citizen not to be dealt with arbitrarily.
    
Over the years, it is true, the income tax system has become one of the 
major players in the national corruption league. But then this indictment, 
with equal justice, can be laid at the door of every other state 
institution: from the police and the criminal justice system to the 
commanding heights of the economy and the highest echelons of government. 
But this is an indictment of the way we administer our laws, not of the 
laws themselves. The income tax code does not sanction tax evasion just as 
the Constitution does not allow the use of power for questionable ends. If 
there is laxity in the collection of taxes, the answer lies not in throwing 
the baby out with the bath water, as the government is trying to do, but in 
improving tax administration.
    
After all, from the earliest times till the present, what have been the 
foremost functions of an organised polity, be it the nation-state or a 
medieval monarchy? They are to maintain law and order and to collect 
revenue. Everything else, from the provision of justice to ensuring the 
common good, comes afterwards. A state unable to discharge these primary 
functions forfeits its raison detre because its failure in these fields 
amounts to breaking the unwritten contract that exists between it and its 
citizens.
    
Does not the government accordingly realise that implicit in the amendment 
which it has smuggled into the tax code is the damning admission of its 
failure to implement and administer the existing laws of the land? But 
faced with this failure, what does it seek to do? Not improve the 
administration of the laws as it should be doing. Nay, for the rule of law 
it substitutes the rule of the qabza group. Accept this logic and the road 
to arbitrariness is thrown wide open. The distinction between due process 
and the law of the jungle disappears. Taxes are not being collected 
properly, so tax collection is handed over to a qabza group. But what if a 
government is not being run properly? What if it is saddled with charges of 
epic corruption and colossal maladministration? Should not then the same 
logic apply? The courts have given us the doctrine of necessity. Through 
its assault on the taxation system this government is toying with the 
intention of giving the nation a crash course in qabza taxation. It would 
beware lest it be hoisted on its own petard.
    
About this amendment, however, there is more than meets the eye. It was 
approved by the cabinet (on the basis of a summary prepared by bureaucrat 
Javed Talat who, as it so happens, has nothing to do with the ministry of 
finance at the moment  this being another example of the ad-hocism which 
passes for due procedure in this government) after the Finance bill had 
already been placed before the National Assembly. Hence this amendment was 
inserted into the Finance Bill only during its third reading when the 
opposition was not present in the house.
    
First of all, no servant of the state, which is what the more self-
righteous mandarins like to call themselves, should have had anything to do 
with such an outrageous proposal. But setting this point aside, in his 
summary Javed talat had put many ifs and buts all of which were brushed 
aside summarily by the Prime Minister who was heard muttering that the 
contract had to be given to Ghurki (Khalid Javed Gurkhi, the MNA from 
Lahore, who is positioning himself to become the Lord Collector of Lahore). 
Not a single soul present in the cabinet meeting raised then tiniest 
objection save for Mustafa Khar (for which may an indulgent Providence 
forgive him his other sins).
    
The principle of qabza taxation is bad enough, contrary as it runs to 
everything that a civilised polity should hold dear. But the intention (yet 
to be put into effect) of farming out the income tax assessment and 
collection of Lahore to Khalid Gurkhi MNA of all people gives rise 
immediately to a host of other misgivings. Gurkhi is a known tough of the 
border area of Lahore. According to newspaper reports (yet to be denied by 
anybody), in anticipation of his being appointed as Lord Collector of 
Lahore, he has applied in large numbers for prohibited bore weapons and a 
fleet of vehicles at concessional rates. Is this a curtain-raiser on events 
to come? And will income tax be collected from the traders of Lahore at 
gunpoint? If so, what is the purpose of this exercise? To fill the depleted 
coffers of the state or to punish the citizens of Lahore for supporting 
Mian Nawaz Sharif?
    
In any event, even the blind should be able to see that this is a formula 
for perpetrating civil strife in the capital of Punjab. Thus far both tax 
collection and tax evasion have been conducted according to the book. Tax 
inspectors do not call on their assesses kalashnikovs in hand. Nor do 
assesses short-change the state through the display of firepower. But if 
the rule of law is to be set aside and the Pakistan Taxation Service (PTS) 
is to become the Gurkhi taxation Service (GTS), then does it take much 
imagination to foresee that violence or the threat of it will beget 
violence?
    
Already as a nation we have done our best to destroy all laws and 
institutions. If better sense does not prevail and this madcap scheme is 
allowed to exercise its fatal charm on the minds of the present ruling set, 
there should be no doubt whatsoever that the fair city of Lahore will be 
turned into one vast race course for the hounds of anarchy.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="imra">Imrans lawyer questions admissibility of some evidence</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Athar Ali

LONDON, July 17: As the hearing of the libel case brought against Imran 
Khan by Ian Botham and Allen Lamb, two former England Test cricketers, 
resumed for the third day in the High Court, a good deal of stir was caused 
when George Carman QC, the defendants lawyer, disagreeing with a ruling on 
the question of the admissibility of certain evidence told Mr Justice 
French that he wanted to challenge it in the Court of Appeal. The jury was 
called in and told of the development. Mr Justice French said this may take 
a long time but until the matter was sorted out he could not proceed with 
the hearing.
    
The judge then called for a recess for the two counsels to find out how 
soon the Court of Appeal could convene to give its verdict. There were 
hurried consultations and much exchange of documents. What the dispute was 
about was summed up earlier by the judge for the jury when he told them 
that a fundamental problem regarding the admissibility of certain evidence 
had arisen on which he gave his ruling but one or both parties do not agree 
with it and one or both the parties want to approach the Court of Appeal. 
He told the jury that it will mean extra costs and is the worst of events 
but he could not go on with the hearing.
    
He adjourned the hearing until the result of the enquiries about how soon 
the Court of Appeal could meet was known.
    
When the court reassembled at midday, Carman and Charles Gray QC, the 
counsel for the plaintiffs, informed the Judge of a formula having been 
devised to resolve the conflict without going to the Court of Appeal. I 
herald good news, said Carman. The dispute arose when Gray objected to the 
admissibility of statements made or articles written by some cricketers. He 
argued that clippings to be made available to the jury should relate to 
those who will be later called as defence witnesses for him to be able to 
cross-examine them. Carman gave the names of witnesses, including Mike 
Atherton, the England captain; David Lloyd, the England coach; Geoffrey 
Boycott, Mike Hendrick, Tony Lewis, Christopher Martin-Jenkings, Ted Dexter 
and Derek Pringle, who will be subpoenaed.
    
TOUGH QUESTIONING: For the rest of the day Ian Botham, the former England 
captain, was on the witness stand facing tough questioning from Carman. He 
at times quibbled with Imran Khans counsel when he cited rules of cricket 
and quoted from writings of other cricketers, including Mike Atherton, to 
make the point that lifting the seam of the ball, application of lypsol or 
sun cream has been a common practice in cricket though this was against the 
rules. Botham kept on repeating himself saying, I have never  done it. He 
denied having ever broken the rules of cricket on bowling which in his eyes 
amounted to cheating. At one point he said he had no thumb nails left to 
scratch the ball as he has had the childhood habit of chewing them.
    
He was also questioned about the reason for not going to South Africa on 
two occasions. He in his testimony yesterday had said that on one occasion 
he refused because his friend the West Indies cricketer, Viv Richards, was 
being allowed to enter the country only after being made an honorary 
white, which he considered a slur. He refused because he thought he would 
be going with a multi-racial team. There was no financial consideration 
attached.
    
The second occasion arose, admitted Botham, when he was angry because he 
was not included in the 1989 England team to tour West Indies and started 
negotiating for a 500,000 pounds tax-free fee to go to South Africa on a 
rebel tour. But realising that it was not the right thing to do he broke 
the negotiations with the South African Cricket Board. I was entitled to 
change my mind said Botham when Mr Carman hinted that he was willing to go 
on a rebel tour for the sake of money.
    
The defence lawyer then told Botham that on June 12, 1994, following the 
publication of the Ivo Tennant biography of Imran Khan, his client had sent 
him a letter apologising for certain negative comments made in the book, 
and attributed to Imran. But Botham said he had no idea what it was about. 
He admitted having made a contradictory statement yesterday while in the 
witness box. He said: it is not an easy job to stand here. I made a 
mistake.
   
SEAM PICKING:  He refused to be drawn into commenting on Imran Khans 
writings and interviews to the effect that there was a simmering debate 
going on about ball-tampering at the time these were made. He said the 
matter came to a head in 1992. Seam lifting, he said, has been going on 
since the year dot but he stated that he personally had not been guilty 
of it.
    
Carman cited the rules relating to bowling to say that seam picking and the 
use of any artificial substance to the ball is disallowed. Botham considers 
seam picking near to cheating as it is against the rules and anything done 
against the rules is in his dictionary cheating. However, the use of sweat 
is an accepted practice.
    
The argument then moved on to the short pitched bowling. Botham did not 
consider bowling bouncers as cheating. It is the umpires discretion to 
caution a bowler if he exceeded the limit on intimidatory bowling, which a 
bouncer is.
    
After the lunch break when the court resumed, Mr Justice French told the 
jury that from the opening remarks on Monday by the plaintiffs counsel 
they may have formed the impression that there has been no apology from the 
defendant. They were told to ignore these remarks.
    
Botham continuing with his cross-examination said that if rules on 
intimidatory bowling are contravened that, in his view, constitutes, 
cheating. But on further questioning he said he has never been warned for 
intimidatory bowling. There was much argument at this stage and at one 
point Botham told the counsel that he was dealing with the game as it is 
run. It was, he said, a legal part of the game to bowl short-pitched balls. 
He was then reminded by Carman that in the 1985 Australia-England series he 
was warned against intimidatory bowling.
    
He was then questioned about a video shown in the court yesterday of the 
1982 Test series in which he was seen throwing the new ball to Bob Taylor, 
the then England wicket keeper, who the commentator Ted Dexter was heard 
saying on the video, gave a thorough going to the ball perhaps to remove 
some of the lacquer.
    
Botham said that he always used to throw the ball to the wicketkeeper to 
remove moisture from it which gathers when the ball is freshly taken out of 
its plastic bag. He did not dry it himself because his hands used to be 
sweaty and sometimes full of dirt.
    
Video shown again: Before a video of the 1982 Test in which Botham is seen 
pressing the ball hard was shown again to the jury, Botham was questioned 
by Imran Khans counsel whether he was trying to alter the shape of the 
ball, which, Mr Carman added, was against the rules of the game. Botham 
explained that he had neither gouged nor tampered with the ball. He had not 
scratched it as he does not have big enough finger nails. He offered to 
show his thumb nails to the counsel.
    
Carman told Botham that it was up to the umpire to change the ball if it 
was felt necessary because it had lost its circular shape. He suggested 
that Botham was in breach of the rules in trying to alter the shape of the 
ball.
    
The counsel drew his attention to the fact that in the Sun newspaper in 
1994 his client had tried to focus on the ball tampering controversy asking 
the cricket authorities to do something about it. But Botham kept on 
avoiding any comment on this. He did not agree with the assertion that seam 
lifting was a common practice and did not amount to cheating. When pressed 
for a straight answer by counsel, Botham said maybe Imran wrote the Sun 
article as a smokescreen for his own activities.
    
I have never cheated, he repeated with some irritation. Mr Carman retorted: 
A lie is a smokescreen when you lied about your criminal offences. Botham 
said he panicked in front of 100 journalists, referring to the drug-taking 
scandal in which he was involved during his tour of New Zealand with the 
England team.
    
He was then asked to comment on extracts read to him from Mike Athertons 
book. A Test of Cricket, in which he says that the application of all kinds 
of agents on the ball has been going on since the game began. Atherton has 
got it wrong, said Botham. It is not an accepted part of the game. He was 
equally dismissive of what David Lloyd, the present England coach, has 
said. Lloyd admitted that roughing the surface of the ball had gone on in 
the county circuit. The court was then shown a video of a programme in 
which Geoffrey Boycott also admitted that it had become an acceptable 
practice in England.
    
The counsel then pointed out that his client never named Botham in the Sun 
article, which is the cause for the libel, as being guilty of ball 
tampering. But Botham said that the article said that all leading England 
bowlers had at one time or another indulged in it and he being the leading 
England wicket taker considers it to be a libel against himself.
    
Bothams cross-examination will continue on Thursday.

<a name="angl">Anglo-Pakistan cricket ties to improve during this tour</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, July 13: The cricketing relations between Pakistan and England have 
not been cordial to say the least since England captain Mike Gatting and 
Pakistan umpire Shakoor Rana involved themselves in a finger-wagging match 
in a Test at Faisalabad in 1987 after the umpire had rightly warned the 
England captain to stop incommoding the batsman, Salim Malik.
    
Pakistans request to exclude Ken Palmer and David Constant from the panel 
of umpires during their series in England earlier the same year and 
Englands refusal to do that had not done much to create good will between 
the two cricketing nations.
    
Englands defeat later in the final of the 1992 World Cup in Australia came 
as a salt on their wounds and the 2-1 defeat in the Test series the same 
year in England at the hands of the touring Pakistanis did not help the 
cause either. The relationship soured with ball-tampering allegations 
against the Pakistan bowlers Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Aqib Javed.
    
There was a lot of apprehension over the treatment that England would get 
in Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup. But there were no mishaps. In fact 
they were given a war welcome and were looked after well. The England `A 
team earlier was given as much attention by the Pakistan cricket 
authorities. Things were forgotten as far as the people in Pakistan were 
concerned.
    
Under this background, the 1996 tourists from Pakistan have arrived in 
England to play another Test series although England for some reason has so 
far resisted any attempt to play a series in Pakistan since that sad 
episode in Faisalabad in 1987.
    
The 72-day tour is already in full bloom. Pakistan had a drawn game against 
Glamorgan. They beat Somerset handsomely, drew a game against 
Northamptonshire and then beat the Minor Counties in a one-day match. 
Already Saeed Anwar had notched up two centuries, including a double one, 
so have Aamir sohail, Inzamam-ul-Haq and the youngster Shadab Kabir with 
innings of 99 and 51 against Northants and is showing signs of promise.
    
The bowlers Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Ata-ur-Rehman, Mushtaq Ahmed and 
Saqlain Mushtaq have also shown that they will not be easy men to handle.
    
The first Test of the three-match series will be played from July 25 at 
Lords and now after a rather low-key series against India, everyone in 
England is waiting for fireworks, on and off the field.

The Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, is not worried about what happened in the 
past. He thinks it is all history and he thinks that this England tour will 
be a very important one and would help to cement the relationship between 
the two countries.
    
This tour means a lot to me and my team, because if you perform well in 
this country you are recognised and rated as a good player and, he thinks 
that every member of his team is proud to be here.

<a name="pros">Prospects for hockey gold in Atlanta appear blurred</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

It was on Monday, April 6, 1896 that the first modern Olympic Games were 
launched in the Greek capital. It was a small beginning at Athens. However, 
the centennial one of 1996 opening on Friday, July 19, will provide one of 
the greatest spectacles of this century with a cast of thousands in 
Atlanta. This will be the second time in eight years that a breath-taking 
five-ring circus will be witnessed in an American city.
    
For hockey it will be the third time that an American town at two nylon 
grounds, will host a thrilling variety of Olympic competition. It was at 
Los Angeles in 1932 that British India scored authoritative victories over 
Japan and the United States. Swift moves flabbergasted the Americans in the 
last match. The legendary Dhyan Chand sent in eight goals while his 
brother, Roop Singh, had a greater haul, netting 12.
    
Fifty-two years later Los Angeles became the happy hunting ground for 
Pakistan, a country not on the world map in 1932. Pakistan were not the 
favourites. Yet the aggressive front-line combination of Kaleemullah, 
Manzoor Jr, Hasan Sardar and Hanif Khan removed Australia from their path 
to enter the final. Early July morning in 1984 Pakistan showed unbridled 
enthusiasm to upset the applecart of West Germany and ascended the podium 
to get the coveted gold after 16 long years. If Pakistan has recorded a 
unique triumph in an American venue eight years ago, can it be counted 
among the elite group or the country is still trying to get over the recent 
hiccups? Has Pakistan exhibited consistency of form in foreign competitions 
to give cause for hope and confidence on the threshold of another Olympic 
campaign.
    
Weather, similar to Karachis, and an earlier win in the pre-Olympic 
tournament at the same place may instil a feeling of optimism in the 
combination that initially landed in Vancouver to play a few tune-up 
matches against Canada. The outfit had expected to improve their mode and 
method in Canada. They had also planned to attain the needed co-ordination 
and harmony in Vancouver. They had a hard fought win in the tour opener but 
then their form see-sawed. However, they possessed the resources to outwit 
a team, which could not qualify for the Olympic competition.
    
If the Atlanta extravaganza demands a powerful performance what is the 
track record of the country during the last eight or nine months to 
evaluate its chances among the 12 competing nations divided in two pools? 
Pakistan, the defending champions, slipped to a third slot in the 17th 
edition of the Champions Trophy in Berlin in October last. Thankfully, they 
smothered the challenge of the Netherlands to go up the rostrum to take the 
bronze medal. One thought that Pakistan will regain their efficiency and 
team-work; pace and precision will be their forte. Their surrender to the 
Indians in the regional battle of strength in Madras in December came as a 
shock to the hockey world, especially because the scoreline was a whopping 
5-2 in favour of the Indians. The Pakistanis could find no refuge from the 
ceaseless assaults of the Indian right duo of Dhanraj Pillay and Mukesh 
Kumar. The left half, Khwaja Junaid, appeared past his best and was time 
after time beaten by the cascade of sallies of Pillay and Mukesh. The 
energy and competence of the Indians delighted the home crowds and 
demonstrated the true elements of the Asian artistry. Shahbaz Ahmed, the 
noted schemer and inner, was hesitant in his moves and appeared to have 
lost much of the sparkle of the 1994 Champions Trophy and the World Cup.
    
Pakistan endeavoured to show some progression and the players exuded 
assurance in April while taking their revenge from India at the pre-Olympic 
invitational contest at Atlanta, the site of the upcoming competition. 
However, soon the problems started. A few days before the squads departure 
to meet European commitments a players revolt halted the camp sessions and 
preparations for two important tournaments. The team had setbacks both at 
the new English stadium at Milton Keynes and Amstelveen in Holland. The 
European hockey powers, Germany and the Netherlands, gave little chance to 
Pakistan to settle down. But consolation wins over Britain in both the 
contests saved them from taking the wooden spoon. Yet, there was all-
pervading gloom in the hockey circles over the European showing.
    
The ups and downs of the statistics point out that the days of Pakistan to 
be counted among the favourites and top echelons of hockey are gone. 
Whatever fervour and skill may be in the side it will be difficult for the 
combination to meet the challenge of the modern-day firm defences and 
bustling thrusts of the Europeans and the Australians. While the deep 
defence is far from solid, a lack of authority is noticeable in the middle. 
The forwards will have to put in extra effort to take their team forward in 
the pool where they have to face such strong contestants as Germany, the 
defending champions, Spain, as also arch-rivals, India.
    
Germany as the title-winners at Barcelona, have a fine record for some 
months. Having won the European laurels at Dublin last August they repeated 
their success two months later at their own centre of Berlin lowering the 
colours of a resilient Australian outfit in the Champions Trophy. They 
continued to dictate terms over Australia even in the four-nation contest 
in Hamburg in April with goal-getting methods in movements. Germany picked 
up the top honours in Milton Keynes while toppling Holland in June though 
the latter had the last word in Amstelveen. With such a splendid record and 
known for their fighting qualities Germany have the right ingredients that 
go to strike gold in such a hard and important competition as the Olympics.
    
Australia are usually a mystery side. Having always been among the odds-on 
favourites their lot had been an unfortunate one for even the New 
Zealanders clinched the Olympic title in Montreal in 1976 and Australia was 
brought down to become the silver medalist. The Australians were unbeaten 
in a four-nation series in May in Cairns and Brisbane in which India, New 
Zealand and South Africa featured. They had a satisfying tournament in 
Hamburg. Their vibrancy and mobility in the front and their pugnacity in 
defence may stand them in good stead at Atlanta. If they maintain their 
tempo of workouts they may get their first gold.
    
The Netherlands are strong contenders for the top honours. With lethal 
hitters of penalty corners in Floris Bovelander and Taco van den Honert 
their chances can at no time be minimised. Besides, they have a balanced 
and nippy forwardline and resourceful middlers and defenders. Their last 
win at Amstelveen over Germany may be taken as to have enhanced their 
prospects at Atlanta.
    
India too is no more among the also-rans. Having put up a resilient show at 
Hamburg against Germany and Australia and earlier Down Under they may 
exhibit the streaks of the Asian tactics and may upset the calculations of 
many countries. It is to be seen how they fare in this 12-nation contest.
    
Apart from Germany, Australia and Holland the picture appears blurred and 
winners may come from amongst them.

<a name="extr">Extra security steps in Atlanta for India, Pakistan hockey</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, July 12: Extra security measures would be taken for the 
Pakistan-India hockey match in the Atlanta Olympics where the authorities 
do not rule out the possibility of bombings, kidnappings or even Japanese-
style poison gas attacks.

Consequently a joint security operation by FBI, CIA, the Defense 
Intelligence Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the State 
Department, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Atlanta and Georgia 
police, besides other agencies, has been launched in the Olympic city.

The operation was described by the New York Times as the largest 
peacetime security operation for a public event in US history.

Officials said on Friday despite such a massive operation, extra security 
measures would also be in place for sensitive events like Pakistan-India 
hockey match or Bosnian-Serb ties.

With an event of this magnitude which is world-wide in scope and truly 
historic, it is reasonable to expect we will have some threats, Bill 
Rathburn, the Security Director for the Olympics, said in Atlanta.

But we have, at this point, no credible threats, Rathburn told a news 
conference, adding that he was not worried that the security will be 
stifling or overwhelming or offensive in any way.

It said there were three times as many guards as athletes, computerised 
credentials that recognise hands and can be turned off by remote control, 
ubiquitous television monitors (including some in a blimp overhead), and 
intelligence agents preparing an antipathy matrix of who in the world is 
angry at whom. 

The underlying fear for the scores of federal and state agencies co-
operating in the effort is that the extravaganza will be a tempting target 
for terrorists, foreign or domestic.

The cost of security is expected to run to at least $303 million, with the 
federal government picking up some $227 million of the tab, and the rest 
divided by local governments and the Olympics committee. 

A centre at which security efforts will be co-ordinated, looking like a 
space launching command, is packed with computers capable of zooming from 
maps of whole city blocks to seating sections of stadiums. It will be 
staffed round the clock by representatives of agencies, including the FBI, 
the CIA, the Defence Intelligence Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco 
and Firearms, the State Department, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Atlanta and Georgia police and other agencies. 

Advanced devices, however, are to provide much of the protection for the 
sites of the Olympic contests and the Olympic village in which the 
athletes, their coaches and trainers will live, said Rathburn, the Security 
Director. 

These include a scanner that matches hand geometry  a three-dimensional 
model of a hand embedded in a computer chip on the credentials  to the 
bearers real hand for a foolproof identification.

<a name="dalm">Dalmiya wants court to interpret ICC rules</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, July 12: The International Cricket Councils annual conference is 
over without coming to a decision as to who will be their next chairman. 
The election to pick a candidate ended in an impasse as was expected. It 
should not have been the way it did.
    
Jagmohan Dalmiya, Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India 
(BCCI), one of the three candidates for the post of the chair, won the 
majority vote but yet was unable to win because he did not get two-thirds 
backing of the nine Test-playing nations. As per constitution of the ICC 
one had earn the vote of six full members to be elected irrespective of the 
majority vote of the 22 associate members.
    
In the first ballot he had the support of 16 votes, compared to 15 by 
Malcolm Gray of Australia and 9 by Krish Mackerdhuj of South Africa after 
which the last named had the decency to withdraw. In the second ballot 
Dalmiya won by 25 to 13 against Gray but he had the support of only four 
full members and Gray had three with two of the full members abstaining.
    
Dalmiya was told that this is not enough and Sir Clyde Walcott will 
continue for another year and not beyond and a new chairman will be elected 
at the next meeting.
    
With the existing system in force how then it will be possible to come to a 
decision if a situation like 1996 election is faced by the ICC.
