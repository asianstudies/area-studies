-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 21: Opposition Leader Mian Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday 
presented documentary evidences in the National Assembly contradicting 
repeated denials by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto that she had purchased 
any mansion in Surrey worth 2.5 million pound sterling.
    
The PML president reiterating his demand that the prime minister and her 
spouse be disqualified as National Assembly members on the charges of 
corruption gave complete background of the deal along with the details of 
two separate consignments dispatched free of cost from Karachi to London 
for the decoration of the Rockwood Estate.
    
He also produced complete record of the telephone calls made from the 
Surrey mansion to Pakistan on different telephone numbers including a 
mobile telephone number registered in the name of a company owned by Jawaid 
Pashah who allegedly acted as a frontman in the deal. One of the telephones 
Mr Sharif alleged was in the personal use of Mr Zardari.
    
The conduct of the prime minister and her spouse in the Surrey scandal 
clearly contradicts both their oath of office as well as the Constitutional 
requirements of their membership of the National Assembly under Article 25 
and 26 of the constitution making them liable to disqualification from 
membership of the National Assembly, he said.
    
He regretted that a reference earlier filed by him regarding the secret 
purchase of 355 acres mansion was dismissed by the Speaker and was not 
referred to the Election Commission for action and adjudication of the 
questions raised in it.
    
He charged that the prime minister in a bid to cover up the deal not only 
lied to the nation but also amassed the wealth through corruption and abuse 
of office.
    
Giving a profile of the palace he said it was spread over 355 acres, which 
is 10 times larger than Lahore Fort built by Moghuls measuring only a 
little over 35 acres. It has an airstrip, an indoor swimming pool, nine 
bedrooms, a magnificent reception hall, several sitting and dining rooms, 
extensive farm land plus three other cottages and farm buildings.
    
Alluding to a story published in Washington Post he said the conduct of Ms 
Bhutto had severely damaged Pakistans image abroad.

<a name="noas">No assurances Kashmir issue will be reinstated</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, Aug 21: The  president of the United Nations Security 
Council, Tono Eitel of Germany, said here on Wednesday that no assurances 
were given to the Pakistani mission or its ambassador, that the Kashmir 
issue will be reinstated on the UN agenda as being claimed by the Pakistan 
foreign office. But, he added, that a review of the decision would take 
place and it is not clear what will be the decision.
    
On July 30, the Security Council decided to drop 50 items from its agenda 
of matters it is seized of, effective Sept 16, 1996, including Kashmir, 
Palestine, Cyprus, and other issues.
    
Talking to Dawn Mr Eitel said, in fact the Pakistani ambassador did not 
raise the Kashmir issue. He talked about procedural matters and the need to 
review the decision.
    
Asked about the claim that the council meeting which decided to drop the 
items was held secret and surreptitious, Eitel said the council meeting 
was not a secret meeting. Everyone knew about it. Its not our fault that 
the Pakistan mission did not follow the proceedings of the Council more 
carefully, he observed.
    
He conceded that besides Pakistan, Arab and other states have raised 
objections regarding the July 30 decision and it will be reviewed in view 
of the objections raised by member states.
    
But he reasserted that several items which are in fact deadwood will 
still remain deleted and the decision to reinstate will take its own due 
course.

<a name="12di">12 die as rally fired upon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 13: Twelve people were killed and 10 others wounded when 
unidentified armed men fired an Independence Day rally, organised by the 
Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan, at Jamshed Road No. 2 on Wednesday afternoon.
    
On Thursday, the government announced a Rs2 million reward for anyone with 
information leading to the killers arrest. 
   
The people have been asked to contact the DIG, Karachi, or the SSP, East, 
if they have any tips to offer. They have been assured that their identity 
would be kept secret.
    
The Jamshed Quarters police have registered a case against four leaders of 
the Tehrik-i-Jaffaria Pakistan and Sipah-i-Mohammadi, including provincial 
TJP chief Allama Hassan Turabi. The three others are: Najmul Hussain, Zafar 
Naqvi and Hassan Shah alias Shah.
 
Besides, several other unidentified attackers have been mentioned in the 
same FIR. It was registered on the complaint of the SSP.

Dawn Report

VEHARI, Aug 18: Fifteen people were killed and 50 injured, ten of them 
seriously, as a result of indiscriminate firing by half-a-dozen masked 
assailants on a Majlis-i-Aza participants in Mauza Ghallu, some 45 
kilometres from here, on Sunday evening.
    
Twelve people were killed on the spot, while three other died later at 
Nishtar Hospital, Multan.
    
Three attackers also suffered bullet injuries in the cross-fire and died 
before being taken away by their accomplices, eye-witnesses said.
 
The Majlis-i-Aza was being held at the residence of a former MPA and local 
PML leader Irshad Ghallu.
    
Sipah-i-Muhammad Pakistan leader Syed Ghulam Reza Naqvi has held the Sipah-
i-Sahaba Pakistan responsible for the tragedy. 
   
He said the SMP would not forget the incident and now no SSP programme 
would be safe.

<a name="blas">Blasts rip through NLC warehouse in Lahore </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Intikhab Hanif and Nasir Jamal

LAHORE, Aug 18: Three powerful explosions blew up the entire concrete 
structure of the army-controlled National Logistic Cell (NLC) warehouse 
near Thoker Niaz Beg on Multan Road in the early hours of Sunday, causing a 
big blaze in which several cars, electronics goods and auto spare-parts and 
imported goods worth millions of rupees gutted.
    
The fire broke out following the explosions which took place in succession 
around at 3 am. Thick clouds of smoke blanketed the area. The fire could 
not be extinguished till late in the night. Fire fighters said the 
combustible material would keep smouldering until everything under the 
debris of the collapsed roof was gutted. It may take another two or three 
days, a fire fighter said.
    
The incident was almost reminiscent of the fire which broke out at the 
Lahore Dry Port in April, causing losses to importers amounting to several 
hundred million rupees.
    
The police have not registered a case. We have been told by army officials 
controlling the NLC warehouse that they will lodge a report after 
completing investigation into the incident, a police official said. He 
said it was not so far determined whether or not the incident was a result 
of subversive action.
    
The cause of the explosions has not been ascertained so far. It is too 
early to say anything right now, one customs official said.
    
NLC officials ruled out the possibility of combustible or chemical material 
causing the blasts and fire as such things were stored separately away from 
the warehouse for security reasons. There was plastic material inside the 
warehouse but it could not have caused the explosions, they said.
 
NLC warehouse in charge Col Najamus Saqib said it was hard to immediately 
determine the cause of the blasts because every clue is buried under the 
debris. He said technical staff of the NLC would determine how the 
explosions had occurred and the warehouse was blown up. I cannot say 
whether or not it is the result of a terrorist act. Nor can I say these 
have been caused by the bomb blasts, he said.
    
The explosions were accompanied by a deafening sound heard in a radius of 
about five kilometres, creating a scare amongst residents of the nearby 
localities. Many residents came out of their houses in panic, believing 
that the explosions had taken place at the armys ordnance depot near the 
Canal View Housing Society at Thoker Niaz Beg. I thought our locality had 
become another Ojhri camp, said one resident who immediately after the 
explosion drove to the site of the occurrence to see what had actually 
happened.

<a name="f16d">F-16 deal again in jeopardy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai 

WASHINGTON, Aug 21: The political crackdown on the opposition in Indonesia 
may cost Pakistan heavily as the Clinton administration is coming under 
increasing pressure to cancel the deal for the sale of embargoed Pakistani 
F-16 jet fighters to Jakarta.
    
Administration officials were initially not prepared to admit that the 
political unrest may pose any threat to the deal for nine F-16s but now 
congressional pressure has increased and the media has begun discussing the 
merits of arming a regime which is bent upon persecuting democratic 
dissenters.
    
Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy recently wrote to Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher saying the F-16s should not be sold to Jakarta as the 
regime was violating human and political rights.
    
Pakistani sources said if the deal with Indonesia was called off, there 
would be almost no chance of the Pakistani F-16s ever getting disposed of 
and Pakistan getting the money back, as agreed to by Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto during her visit to the US in 1995.
    
Some Pakistani-American optimists, however, think that the failure of the 
US to sell the planes may turn out to be a blessing for Pakistan as they 
believe that once President Clinton won his re-election, he could be 
persuaded to return the planes to Pakistan.
    
In the meantime, several US legislators are preparing to intervene in the 
US-Indonesian deal, once Congress re- assembles after the summer recess.

<a name="pres">Pressler voted dumbest man in US senate</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent
    
NEW YORK, Aug 18: Senator Larry Pressler, the author of the infamous 
amendment which barred US aid to Pakistan, was voted the dumbest man in 
the US Senate by his peers, both Republicans and Democrats.
    
But the bipartisan vote took place facetiously behind closed doors by his 
peers who were amused by the bumbling senator, who now heads senates sub-
committee on commerce.
    
According to a report in New York Daily News, Senator Pressler gained 
notoriety following a series of incidents where he was caught sleeping on 
the job.
    
The news item says he (Pressler) once dozed off inside a closet, God knows 
how, and missed a meeting. Another time as chairman of the commerce 
committee, Pressler left a session of that body and mistook a closet door 
for an exit. He waited in the closet, hoping everyone else would leave the 
room, but his giggling colleagues decided to stand by.

Senator Pressler is contesting the Senate seat in South Dakota against 
Democratic nominee, Tim Johnson.

Its a dead heat unless Pressler decides to sleep in yet another closet, 
quipped a pollster.

<a name="uspa">US paper attacks Benazir govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent 

WASHINGTON, Aug 20: The Washington Post on Monday devoted half a page to 
the allegations of corruption against the Benazir Bhutto government.
    
The report said during her campaign to regain power, Ms Bhutto had made 
corruption her biggest issue, repeatedly accusing Nawaz Sharif of financial 
wrongdoing as prime minister.
    
Now, halfway through her five-year term, she finds herself on the receiving 
end of corruption charges by Mr Sharif, the Post said.
    
Opposition leaders accuse Ms Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, of 
collecting bribes and kickbacks on government contracts and siphoning the 
proceeds abroad. The couple denies these charges forcefully. Besides, there 
have been charges that Ms Bhutto has named to her cabinet several ministers 
accused of financial crimes. They allege her government is also engaged in 
a pattern of favouring political and personal associates in lucrative 
business deals.
    
Ms Bhutto devoted an hour-long news conference in June to denying that she 
and Mr Zardari had purchased a 335-acre estate in Surrey. In a newspaper 
column published a week ago, she dismissed the corruption charges as 
political propaganda of her opponents. My adversaries continue to make 
totally unsubstantiated and wild charges of corruption against my party, my 
government and my family, she wrote. It seems their manifesto is 
mudslinging, and the truth is the first victim.
    
The controversy has contributed to Ms Bhuttos growing political problems 
and the unpopularity of her coalition government. Business interests have 
sharply attacked a $1 billion tax increase in her latest budget. Meanwhile, 
however, the International Monetary Fund is pressing her to impose even 
greater fiscal austerity.
    
The allegations against Ms Bhutto have come against a backdrop of 
Pakistans international reputation for corrupt business practices. In 
early June, Transparency International, a Berlin-based international 
coalition of public figures and academics opposed to corruption, reported 
that business executives rated the country as the worlds second most 
corrupt, after Nigeria.

<a name="ukfo">UK forum doubts claim on investments</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Aug 17: A global think-tank, drawing on over 750 senior faculty 
members at Oxford University and other major universities around the world, 
has cast its doubts about claims of foreign investment and political 
stability in Pakistan.
    
Called Oxford Analytica, the UK-based think-tank issued its report on 
investment in Pakistan on Friday, sending it to hundreds of its 
subscribers, including major governments, banks and financial institutions, 
the World Bank and the IMF and investment organisations round the world.
    
The report on Pakistan, issued on Friday, says a total investment of $640 
million was received by Pakistan from July 95 to March 96 against claims of 
$20 billion dollars in MoUs.
    
Nearly all major investments have been in the energy sector where official 
incentives are particularly generous. While expansion in this sector is 
especially crucial in underpinning future growth, the lack of investment 
elsewhere is a serious concern, it says.
    
About 50 per cent of this investment comes from just three countries, and 
top of the list is the United States, it says.
    
On the political side, the report has much stronger views, saying there 
are now real doubts as to how long the government of Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto will last, and there is widespread uncertainty over who might 
succeed it.
    
Adding to the political uncertainty, the report said, there was widespread 
perception among businessmen, both foreign and domestic, that corruption 
and lawlessness has risen over the last two years.

Moreover, the governments reputation has been badly tarnished by 
allegations that senior figures are involved in malpractice. Individuals 
repeatedly accused of corruption include Bhuttos husband, Asif Ali 
Zardari, who was last week made a minister for the first time, the report 
said.

Giving its outlook for Pakistan, the Oxford Analytica report said: Owing 
to the high risks attached to investment in Pakistan, banks impose tough 
conditions and are reluctant to consider any concessions on interest rates. 
Given the bleak outlook for the economy and political stability, the 
prospects for a diversification of foreign investment appear poor at 
present....
    
Concluding the assessment, the report said, mounting fears of economic and 
political stability threaten to erode investor confidence.

Founded in 1975, Oxford Analytica says it has built an international 
reputation for seasoned judgement in assessing the implications of national 
and international developments facing corporations, banks, governments and 
international institutions.

<a name="addi">Addicts, not traffickers, held under drug laws</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 20: Almost all the 2,200 people booked under the anti-drug law 
in Lahore are narco addicts and not traffickers, a list submitted in the 
Lahore High Court by jail authorities revealed on Tuesday.

The addicts account for two-thirds of the 3,300 under-trial prisoners 
lodged in the citys camp jail, which has a capacity for 900.

Such a large number of arrests of addicts brings no credit to police. 
Rather, it demonstrates its inability to nab the traffickers, particularly 
the big fish among them, and plug the source of narcotics supply, Justice 
Khalilur Rehman Ramday told SSP Chaudhry Sajjad on Tuesday.

The addicts have been booked under the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) 
Order, 1979, mostly for possessing or carrying charas. They are generally 
sentenced for six months but remain in camp jail for years awaiting their 
trial.

LAHORE, Aug 19: Punjab police and Lahore district administration on Monday 
seized scores of wagons plying on inter-city routes to transport people to 
the two meetings to be addressed by the prime minister in Lahore on Tuesday 
and in Okara on Wednesday.

Reports from Okara, Sahiwal, Faisalabad, Sheikhupura, Muridke, Gujranwala 
and Jhang said the police and magistrates had set up special pickets at 
different places on the highways to impound wagons on the instructions of 
the provincial government.

Thousands of passengers travelling in the seized wagons had to face a lot 
of difficulties due to the police action which added to their misery in a 
hot and humid weather.

Many of them travelling to Lahore told Dawn that they had to change wagons 
several times because of the police operation.

It took me around six hours  more than twice the normal journey time  
and five wagons to reach Lahore from Okara, one of them told this 
reporter.

The police also took into their possession documents as well as driving 
licences of hundreds of vehicles and their drivers, asking them to reach 
particular places on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings to transport PPP 
workers to the venues of Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos public meetings in 
Lahore and Okara.

Drivers and owners of wagons were warned of cancellation of their route 
permits and strict action if they failed to comply with the instructions.

<a name="govt">Govt increases petroleum product prices</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghousi

KARACHI, Aug 20: Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association on Tuesday 
increased the rates of Super and Supreme petrol to Rs.16.36 from Rs.16.12 
and that of Regular petrol to Rs. 15.06 per litre from Rs.14.66.
    
The new rates were announced by the Petroleum Dealers Association following 
governments decision to enhance fixed sale prices of five petroleum 
products which include 24 paisa rise on Super and Premium and 40 paisa per 
litre increase on Regular petrol.
    
Before this rise in prices the government had reduced twice the prices of 
these products. On June 12 last, just a day before the 1996-97 budget was 
announced, the government had reduced prices of Super/Supreme by 21 paisa 
and that of Regular petrol by 20 paisa per litre. Again on July 22 last the 
government reduced prices of Super/Supreme by 8 paisa and that of Regular 
grade by 14 paisa.

Governments contention to raise prices of petroleum products for domestic 
consumers is that oil prices has increased in international market. 
However, market watchers challenge governments argument and quote crude 
oil prices in London on Monday when it came down to $20.57 a barrel from 
$20.64 a barrel.

Petroleum dealers attribute price rise to unending fall in rupee value vis-
a-vis dollar and other international currencies which coupled with heavy 
load of taxation on crude and petroleum products import necessitated the 
upward adjustment on Tuesday.
    
They believe that petroleum prices are bound to go up further as long as 
the rupee continue to receive beating from international currencies and a 
direct implication would be rise in transport cost, power generation and 
allied activities.

<a name="fiaa">FIA arrests 12 UBL employees for fraud</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter 

KARACHI, Aug 18: Twelve employees of I.I. Chundrigar Road branch of United 
Bank have been handed over to the FIA, following detection of fraud 
involving over Rs300 million.
    
The management is tight-lipped on the issue but employees say the fraud was 
detected in July in which the manager of the bank, Mr Masud, who was also 
involved reportedly went into hiding.
    
According to the employees Mr Masud had been serving the branch for the 
last more than 20 years where he rose to the position of vice president and 
manager from a junior position. No explanation is available as to how a 
single employee worked for more than 20 years at a place when as a matter 
of rule transfer becomes due after four years at the most.
    
Fraud was committed through opening of accounts in fictitious names and in 
the names of employees who were sanctioned temporary overdrafts. The 
amounts in these temporary overdrafts were much higher than the limits 
fixed by the UBL but amazingly remained undetected for the last several 
years as employees believe that it all started much before 1990.
    
Not only the UBL auditors were unable to detect these fraudulent entries 
but the periodical inspection of the State Bank of Pakistan could not trace 
out anything, a senior employee said.
    
Sources in the UBL believe that there are such fraudulent entries in more 
than 100 accounts and beneficiaries have been the staff members and those 
who enjoyed political clout.

Sources in the head office say that irregularities in bank entries were 
detected at I.I. Chundrigar Road branch in May immediately after the State 
Bank took over the UBL. Investigation was initiated thereafter in May, and 
in July it was revealed that these were not mere irregularities but a fraud 
involving about Rs350 million. Interrogation of the officials and employees 
found involved in this fraud is said to have resulted in the recovery of 
Rs45 to Rs50 million. But during this time, the main culprit got an 
opportunity to escape.

<a name="nint">Ninth Five-Year Plan envisages 8% GDP growth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Aug 17: The Ninth Five Year Plan (1998-2003) calls for a steady 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 8 % in the 21st century.
    
The Ninth Plan must think high in terms of growth. A vision of GDP growth 
at 7 % per annum and the determination to make it a reality has to be the 
hallmark of the plan. It should be the bridge that takes the economy to a 
steady growth path of 8% in the 21st century, says a first formal document 
prepared by the Planning Commission that is expected to be made the basis 
for the Ninth Plan.
    
It said that Pakistans time-tested growth hovers around a potential of 6%. 
An agricultural failure leads to a plunge into the 2-3 % range and an 
industrial recession depresses it to 4-5 % range. An occasional jump to 7% 
has almost always been the result of revival from a low base. 
   
A low rate of investment of under 20 % is only one reason for the economy 
to get set in the 6 % mould. There are structural rigidities at work. 
Agriculture as well as industry continue to depend mainly on the dynamism 
of cotton crop and the textile sector.
    
Only a high growth will reduce the time span for doubling the per capita 
income. Again, let there be no doubt that only high growth provides secure 
guarantees against poverty, income inequality and unemployment. Populist 
policies specifically directed to attack these problems relieve their 
burden only temporarily and incompletely. The danger that they might recur 
is always there whenever growth slows down.

<a name="fina">Financial impact of energy policy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem

UNDER the Energy Policy, the Government of Pakistan (GoP) has issued around 
three dozen letters of support (LoSs). The total generating capacity of the 
independent power project (IPPs) with LoSs in place now exceeds a colossal 
7,000 megawatts requiring an outlay of more than $7 billion.
    
To be certain, not all of the IPPs will be able to arrange the required 
debt and equity financing. Out of the three dozen IPPs, at least six among 
them  Power Generation Systems, Kohinoor Energy, AES Lalpir, Southern 
Electric, Japan Power and Rousch Pakistan  claim to have achieved the all-
important financial close (FC).
    
Under the policy, all sponsors of IPPs have been guaranteed that, at least 
60 per cent of their capacity would be bought by WAPDA or KESC at US 6.5 
cents per kwh for the first 10 years and at 5.9 cents per kwh over the 
remaining life of the project.
 
Additionally, projects generating more than 100 MW and commissioned by the 
end of 1997 shall be allowed a premium of US 0.25 cent per kwh. All these 
stipulations have been guaranteed through a standardised bulk power 
purchase agreement (PPA) backed by the GOP while the supply of fuel has 
also been assured under a government-backed fuel supply agreement.
    
Power companies can also issue bonds, registered or bearer, while sponsor 
may obtain shares at a discount. IPPs are exempt from corporate income tax. 
Exemption from custom duty, sales tax and import surcharges have also been 
granted. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) shall provide foreign exchange 
risk and repatriation of equity and dividends has also been allowed.
    
As a matter of fact, no other country on this planet offers either a better 
return or a more generous set of incentives. No wonder that the Private 
Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) was overwhelmed with 116 applications 
with a collective generation capacity of 26,000 MW.
    
Everybody who was anybody, foreign or local, wanted the easy way to mint 
money by setting up a power plant or two. The PPIB issued a letter of 
intent (LOI) to 75 of the 116 applicants, still representing a generation 
capacity of around 20,000 MW (not including Gordon Wus 5,280 MW). Of the 
75, around three dozen have so far managed to obtain an LOS.

Short-sighted policy
    
Pakistans demand-supply gap, on the other hand, ranges between 2,000 MW to 
3,000 MW, assuming of course that there is no significant increase in 
price. In sharp contrast to the current and the expected gap, WAPDA and 
KESC have already been made to enter into contractual agreements binding 
them to buy electricity from IPPs at an excessively inflated rate that 
shall require an outlay of some Rs 75 billion per year between now and the 
year 2007.
    
Keeping in perspective that it has taken WAPDA several decades to reach a 
revenue target of Rs 50 billion per year, that at least one out of every 
four kw generated remains unbilled, an irreparably weak balance sheet 
showing a rather deception accumulated equity of Rs 76 billion and also a 
frail trade-debt picture are all reasons to believe that the GOP shall 
itself be called upon to fulfil the commitments under the various bulk PPA 
in the not too distant future.
    
This is not to suggest that GOP lacks the resources to satisfy its 
obligations. Its economic wizards have time and again told us that they 
could print as much local currency as they desire, somehow forgetting that 
the Security Printing Press runs under strict guidelines agreed upon 
between the GOP and International Monetary Fund.
    
Moving over to the supply side, fuel supply agreements to IPPs have also 
been guaranteed by the GOP. In most cases, the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) 
stands committed to supply as much imported oil as the IPPs shall require. 
Based on a guaranteed 60 per cent plant load factor of the IPPs, the PSO 
company may need upwards of $ 2 billion. Unfortunately, our Security 
Printing Press cannot satisfy international suppliers of oil.
    
The year-to-year trade deficit is expected to hit a record $ 3.5 billion 
and there is no way an additional $ 2 billion could be found within the 
next few years, when a majority of the IPPs are scheduled to go into 
operation.
    
On the demand side of the equation, WAPDA and KESC certainly do not seem 
capable of paying for what they have already contracted to buy, while the 
PSO will not be able to locate the additional $ 2 billion that it is going 
to need to buy imported oil. Just where does the success of the Energy 
Policy really lie?
    
In the US, the 1992 Energy Policy Act may soon be amended allowing 
independent power producers to buy and sell power more widely among one 
another. As a result of deregulation within the utility sector industrial 
electricity rates (that) now average about 4.6 cents/kwh ... may drop to an 
average range of 2.5 to 3.5 cents/kwh.
    
In the Indian state of Maharashtra, the price tag of Enrons Dabhol Power 
Project has been slashed by 11 per cent, lowering the tariff that Enron can 
charge its customers and at the same time increasing the output from 2,015 
MW to 2,450 MW. Meanwhile, Chinese officials have put a cap of 12 per cent 
on the rate of return to foreign firms, but foreign utility operators still 
keep coming. (Hubco was guaranteed a hefty return of 17 per cent and other 
IPPs have no cap).
    
The reason behind this is that the overall growth in electricity 
consumption either in Europe or in North America has slowed down to a 
meagre one per cent per year, while in most developing Asian countries 
demand is expected to grow by eight per cent a year. Most western 
companies, therefore, expect to reap a bonanza by operating in countries 
like the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan.

Dubious projects
    
A guaranteed dollar-denominated real rate of return, duty-free import of 
plant and machinery, an indefinite tax holiday, indexing of the power rate 
with inflation and currency fluctuations, treating fuel costs as a post- 
through item. What more could a utility operator dream of?
    
Some sponsors still attempt to strike even more favourable deals by 
greasing the right government quarters. Enrons Dabhol project in India 
that was negotiated directly with the government had a smell of being 
unfair to the consumers. Gordon Wus project in the Philippines has faced 
similar allegations. The Philippines government has also claimed that 
Westinghouse bribed the Marcos regime. But none of these deals have 
survived the test of time. Governments change and non-merit based projects 
have to suffer the most.
    
The national treasury might witness depletion and the sponsors might reap a 
bonanza, but the poor consumers of this country are destined to remain 
poor. Federal Minister for Water and Power Malik Ghulam Mustafa Khar, has 
said, the two hydel power stations at Mangla and Tarbela Dams cost 12-15 
paisa per unit, while the thermal power for the same volume is priced at Rs 
5 per unit. Who is to listen to what Mr Khar has to say? The lion is 
getting old by the day and his hair is turning grey by the hour.

<a name="disc">Discovering new Wealth Tax assessees</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikramul Haq

THE PRESENT NUMBER of wealth tax assessees in Pakistan portrays a 
disturbing picture. In a country where millions possess substantial assets, 
it is a pity that the Income Tax Department has managed to bring merely 0.2 
million persons on its wealth tax roll.
    
The situation poses a serious question of inefficiency of our present tax 
machinery, as well as the reality that voluntary compliance of tax laws in 
Pakistan is extremely poor. The data released by the Central Board of 
Revenue in the latest issue of CBR Year Book, 1993-94 & 1994-95 testifies 
to this grim reality. The following figures tell the story for the last 
five years:
    
Source: CBR Year Book 1994-95
    
The share of Wealth Tax in direct taxes has shown a very disappointing 
increase i.e. from 2.5 per cent in 1990-91 to 2.7 per cent in 1994-95. The 
share in total tax collection increased from 0.4 per cent in 1990-91 to 0.7 
per cent in 1994-95.
    
It is disturbing to note that the share of wealth tax in total direct tax 
collection is as low as 2.7 per cent even in the Financial Year 1994-95. 
This leads to the obvious conclusion that performance of the department, 
despite tall claims, is extremely poor in the area of wealth tax.
    
I will pinpoint here one area, which alone can give us revenue of not less 
than Rs 9,100 million if the wealth tax law is properly enforced. The 
process of broadening the wealth tax-base requires the following three 
steps:

Removal of imbalances
   
Imbalances existing in the present law should be removed. It is a strange, 
but bitter fact that while every car is part of ones net wealth, 
agriculturists have been allowed to enjoy exemption in respect of such 
expensive vehicles like Pajeros, Land Cruisers etc. This is just one 
example. I leave this to the department to consider as to how we can 
motivate a person to pay wealth tax on his small car, when the CBR, while 
exercising its delegated power u/s 5(20) of the Wealth Tax Act, decided to 
give exemption in respect of Pajeros and Land Cruisers. 

Modern survey techniques
     
The accumulation of wealth reflects itself in various properties such as:
    
(a) houses/buildings,
    
(b) plots,
    
(c) new business,
    
(d) securities, saving certificates, fixed deposits,
    
(e) purchase of shares and
    
(f) valuable articles.
    
The department must develop a system of monitoring to find who is the owner 
of the above referred asset or assets on a particular valuation date. This 
will help to discover a number of new wealth tax assessees. Information 
should be collected from the following agencies on a yearly basis (with 
reference to particular valuation date);
    
i. Registration authorities in each district,
    
ii. Registrars, Deputy Registrars and Assistant Registrars of the Corporate 
Law Authority wherever the Authority is maintaining an office.
    
iii. Principle officers of all big companies.
    
iv. Banking authorities.
    
There is an urgent need to collect, and compile the data referred to above 
and then, after proper analysis, the department can evaluate the actual 
potential of wealth tax collection in the country.

Efficient tax machinery
    
Without the existence of an efficient tax machinery, the goal of broadening 
of wealth tax base can never be materialised. A lot of efforts are required 
in this direction. Everyone agrees that the present tax machinery is 
totally in shambles, yet no concrete measures have been taken by the 
concerned quarters to improve the structural form of the present tax 
collection machinery. It needs to be emphasised that unless we have a 
reliable, efficient tax machinery, no information can be helpful to 
discover new wealth tax assessees.
    
The following special measures, if taken, can go a long way to help 
increase the number of wealth tax assessees in Pakistan.
     
Targeting the real persons: There were about one million persons in 1990 in 
Pakistan having private farms exceeding 20 hectares (figure taken from 
Economic Survey 1995-96). Total hectares owned by them are 4.55 million. 
If wealth tax of Rs 2,000 per hectare is levied, instead of valuation of 
agricultural land on PIU basis (which is for obvious reasons quite obsolete 
now), the revenue potential comes to Rs 9,100 million which alone is 800 
per cent more than the target of Rs 1,644 million collected under the 
wealth tax head in financial year 1994-95. These farms are owned by big 
feudal lords who are not paying any income tax on their agricultural 
income. They must pay at least Rs 500 per acre as wealth tax on their huge 
farms. 
    
This avenue alone will give the department at least one million new wealth 
tax assessees, with fixed revenue potential of Rs 9,100 million.
     
Market capitalisation of shares: Till 31st March 1996, we have a total 
market capitalisation of ordinary shares at Rs 346.77 billion. This is a 
totally documented area and information can be collected from all listed 
companies to evaluate new wealth tax payers having substantial number of 
shares as on 30.6.96.
     
Investments in government securities: Total investment in different kinds 
of national investment schemes as on 31.3.1996 stand at Rs 299.92 million. 
This can be an excellent source to increase the total number of wealth tax 
assessees.

Exemptions
    
The direct taxation system in Pakistan continues to have a narrow base, 
particularly in consequence to the existence of a large number of 
exemptions/ exclusions, and the major sector of agriculture being outside 
the tax ambit.
    
The shortcomings of income as the tax base, have lately been the source of 
public criticism. Most of the critics have been making only a generalised 
demand for abolition of the tax without proposing any alternative base for 
personal taxation.
    
Demands of this kind normally would not merit serious consideration because 
their source can be traced back to vested interests. However, recently a 
rather serious attempt in the area has been made by the Institute of Public 
Studies and the International Institute of Islamic Studies calling for 
total abolition of income tax and its replacement by a tax on net worth 
defined as total assets minus total liabilities of a taxable unit.
    
They have argued that the correct measure of the ability to pay tax is the 
surplus of income over expenditure which is reflected in increase in net 
worth, stated to be more easily detectable and measurable and more 
difficult to conceal or manipulate than income.
    
Wealth, no doubt offers an alternative measure of ability to pay. But 
wealth cannot be adopted as a tax base in exclusion as an alternative to 
other bases, because a levy with wealth alone as the tax base can only be 
punitive in nature. Such a tax would, in fact, amount to levying a penalty 
on savings, because, besides inheritance, wealth represents accumulation of 
a persons savings. 
    
Another problem with this form of taxation is that a taxpayers cash flow 
may not correspond to his taxable capacity as the taxable wealth is 
generally computed on the basis of current market value of assets acquired 
originally at much less cost. That is why previously wealth was not adopted 
as the exclusive measure of ability to pay any where in the world; wealth 
tax has mostly been adopted as a supporting arm for income taxation.
    
The main rationale offered for imposition of wealth tax in combination with 
income tax usually is that income alone is not a sufficient measure of 
taxable capacity. Since the possession of property is known to have an 
intrinsic value, independent of its actual income-earning power, it 
represents a reserve of spending power which reduces the taxpayers need 
for saving from current income, greatly increases the owners freedom of 
action in the sphere of economic activity and also signifies a degree of 
control over the nations economy. 
    
It, in fact, increases a taxpayers ability to pay. Under these 
circumstances, adopting income as the only measure of economic power and 
ability to pay may amount to discrimination against those who have earned 
income through personal efforts and not through windfall or inheritance. In 
view of these considerations, a combination of income and wealth as tax 
base is more appropriate for distribution of tax burden.
    
It is generally acknowledged that a tax on capital possesses the inherent 
capability of inducing the owners of capital to use it in a more productive 
manner. Being a charge on the value of an asset, it tends to induce the 
owner to make such a use of the asset as would yield sufficient additional 
income to pay the tax imposed on it.
    
If a person is taxed on capital sitting in a non-productive use, he is made 
to have an incentive to put that capital back into the economic mainstream 
and get some income out of it. The tax can, therefore, be made to work as a 
vehicle for rendering the socially most desirable use of capital and 
economically more beneficial for the owner.
    
The compelling impact of this instrument can be made to work in the 
Pakistani situation for not only driving inherited resources out of idle 
assets but also for enforcing diversion of the accumulation of current 
savings in the society towards more productive use.
    
The tax is actually a levy on capital only by definition. What it actually 
seeks to subject to charge is only the inefficient capital. Capital 
efficiently employed is expected to be able to increase its productivity in 
order to nullify the tax burden. When seen in this context, the tax assumes 
the character of a levy on the potential income that a given amount of 
capital is capable of yielding when employed in the right kind of assets.
    
It is possible to devise a system inter-linking the level of exempt income 
that a taxpayer may enjoy under the income tax regime with the level of 
potential income that may be imputed (at a pre-fixed rate of return) to 
capital charged to tax under the capital tax regime.
    
This theoretical analysis provides a good case for capital taxation in 
Pakistan where most of the assets are not diverted towards high-yielding 
investment, resulting in a stagnation of the economy. The socio-economic 
conditions of Pakistan, therefore, suggest that income alone cannot be a 
sufficient base for taxation. It appears imperative to introduce a tax-
reform package aimed at:
    
Broadening the direct tax base by specifically levying tax on capital 
assets, re-introducing estate duty and tax on capital gain of immovable 
property.
    
Rationalisation of tax system in order to achieve the merger of various 
levies under one administrative control, and by simplification of 
procedures.
    
Discouraging investments in unproductive and luxury items and by granting 
exemptions/incentives to value-adding manufacturing sector. For the 
achievement of these goals capital taxation can play a vital role for 
shifting the tax burden from investment and production to consumption and 
non-productive assets formations.
    
In this perspective, we can enhance the number of wealth tax assessees 
provided that a policy of uniform taxation is introduced both for 
agricultural and non-agricultural assets.

<a name="dosa">Dos and donts of sustainable development</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M.B. Naqvi

A SIGNIFICANT development took place early this month in Islamabad. It was 
the second annual Sustainable Development Conference organised by the 
Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI). It was a remarkable 
gathering of economists, human rights workers, ecologists and experts of 
various disciplines. The focus was, predictably, on both development and 
its sustainability. This gathering was responsible for a great deal of 
clarifications of ideas and adding new dimensions to the concept and 
practice of development.
    
The SDPI is performing a yeomans service to Pakistanis in introducing two 
vital elements to the national discourse on the subject: one is tolerance 
and pluralism of all new ideas. Secondly it goes right down to the 
grassroots in conceiving development and relating all issues that impinge 
on such a development at the grassroots. Which is a great service.
    
The inner linkages of various aspects such as good governance, ecological 
considerations, human rights and economic progress measured in terms of 
human development were underscored. The goals that are required for the 
endeavour to be made by all democrats were probed and those who want true 
progress for actual alleviation of felt human problems and for finer social 
and cultural purposes cannot but be happy.
    
The highlights of this years conference was a particular session that 
dealt with Pakistans current economic situation. Its distinguishing 
features were addresses by Qazi Aleemullah, the Planning Commission chief; 
Dr Mahbubul Haq, former Finance Minister and Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi 
in charge of the finance portfolio.
    
It was a remarkable session for underlining the many facets of the present 
economic situation.

Eloquent criticism
    
As could be expected, Dr Haqs presentation was as clear and eloquent as it 
was incisive of some of the things it criticised. It is not our intention 
to discuss the validity and the adequacy of the solution he offered. All 
that it needs to be said here is that its critique of the present trends 
and policies was trenchant and incisive, though it is necessary to note 
that he basically agrees with the larger contours of the economic policies 
being pursued by the present government, i.e. the Structural Adjustment 
Programme as recommended by the IMF.
    
Dr Haq is highly critical of the government on various counts, one of which 
is truly a structural question, viz doing away with feudalism.
    
The doctors is remarkable for having stuck to this position for long and 
has made many enemies in high places because of that. But the adequacy of 
the prescription he makes for the recovery of Pakistans economy from its 
present troubles is approximately the same as that of the IMF programme on 
which it insists and the Pakistan government seems to be failing in 
implementing it.
    
Qazi Alimullahs and Mr Qureshis addresses remarkable for showing 
everything necessary and possible were being done by the government.
    
What does the terms sustainable development imply? It is a subject on which 
long papers were read and learned discussions took place.
    
It was shown to the satisfaction of all that the kind of consumption that 
is standard today in America and other developed countries is not one that 
can be sustained if all other nations were to adopt that as their goal. The 
experts invited the people to imagine the result of all the developing 
countries achieving economic progress through development efforts aimed 
directly at increasing consumerism and consumption  a quantum of 
consumption that is typical of developed countries.

Consumer society
    
The fact of the matter today is that internationally 20 per cent of the 
population of the world is consuming at least 70 per cent of all the 
resources of the earth. These resources are sure to run out soon and the 
planet may soon be a desolate place that would not be able to support even 
a fraction of todays population should that happen.
    
It is needless to point out the various facts that have now become the 
commonplace regarding climate and other ecological damage that would occur 
if the present trends are not arrested. The concept is certainly clear and 
unexceptionable.
    
The difficulty arises only when these concepts are extended to specific 
items. The new emphasis on preferring renewable or rechargeable resources 
is most welcome. Some new issues raise more problems than they solve.
    
An instance is the opposition to high dams on rivers. The kind of 
destruction they wreak in areas upstream of the dam and the damage that is 
done to the ecology of these areas leads many to the conclusion that big 
dams do more harm than the benefit they provide.
    
This is not immediately acceptable to many say like Ghulam Mustafa Khar, 
who would like to argue that the benefits in terms of electricity and 
irrigation waters that big dams give to areas and the benefits that people 
derive from them far outweigh the losses to people whose holdings and 
houses get submerged and the supposed ecological damage.
    
It remains a moot point whether we should all oppose big dams simply 
because they involve some ecological and human costs. Some of the more 
ardent ecologists simply refuse to countenance the cost-benefit analysis of 
those who try to balance the costs against the benefits. The subject will 
of course continue to engage the attention of all high-minded people.

Good governance
    
One of the most important recent contribution to the ideas and practices of 
sustainable development comprises the notion of good governance. Good 
governance itself comprises a large number of components ranging from a 
responsible democratic government to the idea of participatory democracy 
that begins at the grassroots and it takes into its sweep the inalienable 
human rights that need to be augmented further with social and economic 
rights.
    
Needless to say it includes things like rule of law, the acceptance of the 
value of human being as a unique and ultimate goal, the pleasure and 
happiness of whom is the ultimate goal of all social activities.
    
Good governance is now thought to be both a goal in itself and the means of 
sustainable development. Indeed it is now considered to be most vital 
element of the sustainable development.
    
Most new converts to the idea of sustainable development hold that mere 
addition to the incomes of the people even jobs for all, do not necessarily 
mean development that could be supported if they do not include the 
elements of good governance, particularly human rights.
    
All manner of those who have reservations about any kind of democracy or 
the very concept of democracy emphasise the importance of pure economic 
progress over time make the concept more controversial than otherwise it 
would be. In the normal course, ordinary people will have no difficulty in 
recognising the direct linkage between development and political rights. 
Neither can substitute the other.

Classic liberals
    
Many classical liberals used to hope that civil liberties were all that was 
needed to ensure good life. Today we have had other schools that hold 
economic well-being and welfare of all as the be all and end all of all 
human endeavour. The fact is easy to recognise today that what people 
everywhere need is both human rights in the fullest measure possible mixed 
with development conceived in an enlightened manner that include all the 
new ideas like preventing climate change, soil erosion and deforestation, 
denudation of earth and pollution in cities and what have you.
    
All these concepts now are increasingly being taken as component parts of 
economic development. It is no longer possible to go back either to pure 
human rights wallahs that ignore economic well-being or those who emphasise 
higher standards of living for all and ignore political rights and other 
social issues. The time has passed for this either or approach on the 
subject.
    
Just as Pakistans economic situation was intensively discussed in a number 
of sessions, sometimes explicitly and sometimes as component part of some 
other problem, similarly international economic situation also engaged the 
attention of many participants.
    
Some of the participants were experts in their subjects. Such experts had 
come from Germany and the US among others, the conference had drawn people 
from such far off places as Thailand. There were delegations from Sri Lanka 
and Bangladesh. India had sent its own contingent which included a retired 
foreign secretary and two experts who stood out throughout the discussions: 
one was Smithu Kothary, the son of the illustrious Rajni Kothary, who dealt 
with all manner of problems ranging from human rights to sustainability of 
development, co-ordination with human rights organisations and organising 
political action by NGOs. And there was also Ashok Khosla, with a 
background of both science and technology, who specialises in simpler home-
grown technology meant for grassroots employment generation and local 
additions to the infrastructure of local economies. His machine and ideas 
of local power generation and generating economic development contrasted 
sharply with some of the Pakistani experts who spoke purely in the 
Pakistani context of combating the present economic maladies.
    
The one who led the discussions on the international economic situation, 
with special reference to MNCs, was David Cotton from the United States. He 
frequently writes in the weekly news magazine NATION. He is an acknowledged 
expert on MNCs functioning and he leads a is an acknowledged expert on 
MNCs functioning and he leads a group that holds alternative ideas on how 
to counter the near sovereignty of MNCs over the world economy.
    
His rejection of the IMF Structural Adjustment Programmes and his 
correlating it with what the larger corporations do inside America were 
very instructive.
    
The long and short of these discussions was the need to watch and regulate 
the activities of the MNCs in third world. Although Mr Cotton never uttered 
the word, but it is possible to describe his prognoses and remedies as 
trying to defang the MNCs. He opposed the idea of globalisation and truly 
liberalised trade as bogus and held that the ideal should in fact be 
localisation of the economies. The latter should first of all make progress 
domestically so that they do not fall a prey to the predatory MNCs in the 
bogus name of liberalisation and globalisation.

Grassroots employment
    
On the subject of good governance notable contributions were made by Tariq 
Bannauri himself,, Smithu Kothary and to an extent Ashok Khosla. They 
emphasised the need for grassroots employment generation through new types 
of economic activities in the informal sector.
    
A valuable contribution was made by Tasneem Siddiqui on the subject. But 
the constraints posed by local feudal influence took most people back to 
the problems discussed in other sessions viz namely good governance, need 
for adding to local infrastructure and new kinds of financing.
    
One special subject that attracted a lot of attention was preventing 
pollution in the seas and cities. The noise and smoke pollution in the 
cities of Pakistan were highlighted by innumerable speakers who showed that 
the position is so unsustainable today that something should be done and 
soon, the pollution in the cities has now become a major health hazard and 
a positive disincentive to the desired kinds of development at grassroots.
    
Insofar as the pollution of sea is concerned, around Karachi and other 
areas, the way in which the natural resources of the seas are being short-
sightedly exploited was seen to be a positive drag on the overall progress 
rather than a part of development.
    
The ecology of the sea was equally emphasised and not many people could be 
found who would support the complacency of Authority in this country.
    
Although it is a world-wide problem, Pakistan and some of the countries in 
the region are recipients of all kinds of industrial waste, including 
nuclear waste, from the developed countries. That too is now a major and 
growing problem for countries of the Third World in a general sort of way 
and for Pakistan and some of its neighbours in particular.
    
These are dimensions that frequently tend to be ignored but can no longer 
be allowed to remain ignored. Similarly the concept of small dams, such as 
emphasised by Ashok Khosla and some of the other Indian representatives as 
well as by many Pakistanis remains a phenomenon that is astonishing. How 
can a country where the building of Kalabagh dam is such a big controversy, 
people fail to make use of thousand and one opportunities of generating 
electricity locally at very low cost, with very little overhead expenses. 
It is beyond anyones understanding.

<a name="taxe">Taxes on farm incomes, wealth to be raised</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: Pakistans diminishing resources have forced the 
authorities at last to broaden its highly weak tax base by substantially 
increasing taxes on agricultural incomes and wealth.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here on Thursday that the high ups of the 
government have expressed serious concern over what they termed alarmingly 
low recovery of taxes from the landed gentry during 1995-96 and decided to 
tax it with a view to enhancing the countrys declining resources.
    
The landlord class paid only Rs 28.25 million during the financial year 
ended July 31, 1996, while salaried people deposited Rs 1.82 billion during 
that period.
    
Our landlords have paid shockingly low amount of taxes in 1995-96 and this 
is due to our elected representatives who thwarted all our efforts to 
effectively tax the owners of huge agricultural assets, said an official.
    
Nevertheless a serious effort has now been made to address the issue by 
according top priority to recover agriculture tax and wealth tax 
commensurate with their phenomenal incomes and holdings.
    
The approach to the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1998-2003) was to ensure that the 
agricultural income and wealth taxes should be high on the agenda during 
the plan period.

<a name="indi">India proposes joint stand with Pakistan in WTO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 15: India wants to take a joint stand with Pakistan in World 
Trade Organisation (WTO) on a proposal recently tabled by Canada on setting 
up a Working Party in the WTO to study the multifarious aspects of the 
international investment.
    
India has serious reservations on the Canadian proposal, now under 
discussion at the WTO at Geneva, and feels that once a Multilateral 
Investment Agreement is signed the role of the host countries will be 
reduced considerably in scrutinising the investment proposals.
    
The Indian Commerce Secretary, Mr Tejendra Khanna, in a letter to his 
counterpart in Islamabad, Mr Salman Farooqui, has expressed his desire that 
both India and Pakistan should evolve a consensus on the Canadian proposal.
    
I would like to share with you some of the points that we have been 
repeatedly making in various fora at Geneva and elsewhere on the subject, 
wrote Mr Khanna while asking his Pakistani counterpart to give his 
assessment of the situation as he sees it and how he proposes to deal with 
this subject in the heads of delegations in the process currently on in 
Geneva.
 
India also wants that the issue should first come up for consideration in 
the UNCTAD as was decided in its last meeting and as such there is no need 
for Ministerial Conference at Singapore to set up a Working Party on 
investment.
    
Giving the Indian point of view on the investment issue, Mr Tejendra Khanna 
said, both European Commission (EC) and Canada are looking for right to 
investment as an important element of Multi- lateral Investment Agreement 
(MAI) in the WTO.
    
He said many developing countries will find it politically difficult to 
concede the right of investment and the right of establishment.

<a name="heav">Heavy covering purchases in PTC vouchers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 21: Selective support on Wednesday emerged strong on the blue 
chips counters but there were no indications that the stock market was back 
on the rails.
    
Heavy covering purchases in PTC vouchers around Rs 34 on news that talks 
for its privatisation, with the Indonesian and Dutch consortium team are in 
progress in Islamabad was said to be an aiding factor, which pushed its 
price further higher.
    
It appeared a temporary boost as some of the leading institutional traders 
holding short portfolio positions were back in the rings and made active 
purchases at the lower levels.
    
However, rallies in the big four, including Adamjee Insurance, PSO, Hub-
Power and PTC showed their relative strength sending messages in the right 
quarter that they could lift the index if not the broader market.
    
The KSE 100-share index showed a moderate recovery of 3.77 points at 
1,426.84 as compared to 1,423.07 a day earlier as most of the leading base 
shares finished recovered.
 
Dealers said although the market is ripe for a grand technical rebound 
owing to its highly oversold position, it lacks direction as bulls too 
shaky about the near-term outlook.
    
They said the market needs sustained support at least from the financial 
traders to boost badly shaken confidence of general investors who have 
decided to stay away.
    
But in a way they have demonstrated that they could lift prices of pivotals 
if they desired so and there are sound reasons behind their action.
    
It was perhaps in this background that both PSO and Adamjee Insurance, 
which have declined sharply over the last few sessions showed broad rallies 
as investors covered positions. Both rose by Rs 6.50 to 10 amid active two-
way trading.
    
But other leading shares failed to pick up their lead and groaned under the 
weight of renewed selling coming mainly from jobbers and sundry 
speculators.
 
There were some exceptions, however, as MCB, General Tyre and Dream World 
managed to post good gains on covering purchases at the lower level.
 
Dadabhoy Insurance, which was quoted spot apparently to forestall further 
increase in its price was quoted further higher by Rs 5.
 
PEL, Pakistan Refinery, Atlas Lease, 4th ICP, J.K. Spinning and ICP SEMF 
were among the prominent local losers, falling by one rupee to Rs 5.
    
Among the MNCs, which fell further, Bata Pakistan, Glaxo Lab, Dawood 
Hercules, Pak-Suzuki Motors, Shell Pakistan, and Siemens Pakistan were 
leading, which finished lower by one rupee to Rs 3.50.
    
Trading volume was slightly lower as compared to Tuesday as the market was 
closed a bit earlier owing to celebration of Eid Milad later in the evening 
in the premises of the Stock Exchange building.
    
It fell to 22.532m shares from the previous 24.590m shares, bulk of which 
went to the credit of PTC vouchers.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 25 paisa on 8.814m, 
followed by Hub-Power, higher 35 paisa on 3.725m, Fauji Fertiliser, lower 
60 paisa on 0.735m, and ICI Pakistan, unchanged on 0.679m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Dewan Salman, up 15 paisa on 
0.412m shares, Lucky Cement, lower 20 paisa on 0.240m, KASB Premier Fund, 
off 25 paisa on 0.132m, Pakistan Synthetics, up 20 paisa on 0.130m and 
Engro Chemicals, up 25 paisa on 0.119m shares.
    
There were 305 actives, out of which 151 shares fell, while 67 rose, with 
67 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="kara">Karachi Port Trust-1</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

PLAYING on well-loved home ground this week, on which four generations 
(both paternal and maternal) of my family have played, and the fifth is 
playing, I write on the port of Karachi with which we have been associated 
as benefactors, developers, conservators and users.
    
Any man of Pakistan with a maritime mind knows that:
    
 Karachi is essentially a backwater harbour sustained by natural scour.
    
 The mouth of Chinna Creek, opening on to the seat at Clifton, was closed 
over a hundred years ago so as to convey through the harbour the flowing 
and ebbing waters to and from the eastern backwater, thereby obtaining 
their scouring power upon the harbour channel and entrance.
    
 The tides in Karachi are semi-diurnal, with a lesser and a greater tide 
each day.
    
 The only entrance to the harbour is through the channel flowing between 
Manora and Keamari, through which the whole tidal volume passes with each 
tide generating velocities sufficient to naturally maintain charted depths 
in the navigable channel.
    
 The accumulation of any sediment, or reclamation of land, in either of 
the eastern or western backwaters would disturb the tidal flow and thus the 
depth in the navigable channel necessitating excessive and expensive 
perpetual mechanical dredging.
    
For the benefit of the non-maritime mind, let me explain. The entrance to 
Chinna Creek opening on to Clifton beach was blocked off, creating the 
eastern backwater. Two reservoirs, the eastern and the western backwaters, 
were engineered to be large enough to accommodate sufficient volumes of 
water to allow an inward and outward flow which would provide a natural 
scour and maintain chartered depths in the navigable channel, obviating 
excessive mechanical dredging.
    
Any man who has dealt for the past fifty-two years with the port and the 
Trust that operates it will affirm that:
    
 For the first thirty-two years, when there was no political interference, 
the Chairmen (chief conservators) of the Board of Trustees (conservators) 
were appointed on considerations of merit and integrity, dedicated to 
ensure, first of all, the safety and the conservation of the port. The last 
such man of an era that started with Chairman Engineer William Bushby, was 
my good friend Rear-Admiral Zahid Hasnain (1972-76). Zahid would not 
oblige and was unceremoniously sacked by minister of communications 
Oxford educated talented cousin Mumtaz Bhutto.  
   
 Thereafter, with political interference on the boil, merit gave way to 
placidity and ability ceded to greed. The quality of the Chairmen appointed 
deteriorated, as did the quality of Trustees. Corruption set in.
    
 The first Chairman, appointed by the PPP in 1989 following the 
democratisation of dictatorship, was Alim Akhtar Shah (Catastrophe) known 
to have been charged in court with having forged his credentials, who was 
later convicted. He was followed in swift succession by Rear-Admiral Akbar 
Hussain Khan (Disaster), and Rear Admiral S.R. Hussain (Calamity). The 
harm done to the port and its environs between 1989 and 1992 was ruinous.
    
Now to the crux of the matter: 75 acres of prime Port Trust land planned to 
be reclaimed and yet to be reclaimed, on the Bath Island side of the Mai 
Kolachi bypass.
    
In 1989, Alim Shah, in cahoots with the Sindh government headed by Qaim Ali 
Shah, and the federal government, transferred or was coerced into 
transferring the 75 acres to the Sindh Board of Revenue, enabling the 
latter to carve the acreage into plots to be distributed to front men or 
cronies. This he unlawfully did without the approval of his Board of 
Trustees.
    
However, before the area could be physically handed over, or any 
consideration agreed upon, or a sale deed executed, the federal and Sindh 
governments were dismissed in mid-1990.
    
Vice-Admiral Ahmad Tasnim was appointed Chairman in 1992 and second 
thoughts were generated about the proposed reclamation. At about the same 
time, in December 1992, a news report informed us that 75 acres of port 
land was being transferred/allotted to various cronies by the Sindh 
government. Thereupon, Tasnim protested and in January 1993 Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif directed that the 75 acres transferred (on paper) to the Sindh 
government be returned (on paper) to the KPT.
    
Tasnim naturally thought that the matter was resolved, and was surprised to 
receive a letter in December 1993 from a lawyer, Bashir Ahmed, seeking NOCs 
to the transfer of plots of KPT land, falling within the 75 acres, by 
certain clients of his. He made inquiries and found that the Sindh 
government in October 1992 had indeed quite unlawfully and illegally 
allotted/transferred/sold 72 of the 75 acres in acre-lots to 15 friends of 
the nation.
    
A bewildered Tasnim sought advice. My advice was that the land should not 
be reclaimed, the tidal flow should not be disturbed any further (as it 
was, a lot of garbage and sediment had accumulated in the backwaters), and 
that he should move the court and seek an injunction.
    
The Admiral was reluctant to take on both provincial and federal 
governments, but the users were able to prevail upon him. I discussed the 
issue with my lawyer, Makhdoom Ali Khan, who opined that the court would 
indeed give an injunction and save the land.
    
The KPT engaged Barrister Makhdoom Ali Khan and a suit (No.240/94) was 
filed in the Sindh High Court in April 1994. The defendants included the 15 
friends of the nation.
    
But then Disaster again struck. Admiral A.H. Khan was once again 
appointed Chairman on November 2, 1994, and almost immediately an abortive 
attempt was made to withdraw the suit. It failed and Brigadier Muhammad 
Hanif, General manager of the KPT for such affairs, wrote to their 
Barrister on November 15, 1994, instructing him ... ..... to process the 
case vigorously in the High Court.
    
On December 4, 1994, the suit was heard by Justice Ghulam Mohammed Hussain 
Malik who was pleased to grant ad interim orders against defendants No. 6-
20, the friends, the illegal allottees.
    
But, on May 2, 1995, Makhdoom Ali Khan though on a winning wicket, was 
instructed to withdraw the suit. A letter from the KPT Secretary and a 
Board resolution were produced before the court with the withdrawal 
application. The court dismissed the suit as withdrawn.
    
AH still chairs the Board and conducts the affairs of the Trust in what, 
even under present circumstances, could be termed conduct unbecoming. 
When he does wrong, the government-nominated Trustees and his officers are 
openly told that he acts under the instructions of his boss (no one knows 
who this is) and that they should follow suit or otherwise ....... He 
encourages the Trustees to take trips at KPT expense on the pretext of 
visiting European and Far Eastern ports, though many of them have never 
visited nor have they the slightest clue as to what their own port and 
harbour look like. Regular Board meetings on fixed dates are not held, 
meetings are called at short notice preventing many members from attending. 
The Trustees, whether they are interested or not, are never properly 
briefed.
    
Port plots are allotted to Trustees at highly concessional rates. In June 
this year when the last Board dispersed, each Trustee was presented with a 
laptop computer (around Rs. 80,000 each) as a parting gift. A Trustee just 
cannot be a beneficiary of what he holds in Trust.
    
The Estate Department of the KPT has been hard hit. This year, the Chairman 
recommenced the process of handing over to the Sindh government 75 acres of 
yet to be reclaimed land. Khan Mohammed Qureshi, Estate Manager, an old 
hand, was under constant pressure to write notes he did not want to write; 
he suffered a heart attack, was hospitalised, and whilst recuperating, his 
portfolio was illegally and incorrectly transferred to his deputy, Zafar 
Hussain Rizvi, who also refused to write as directed by the Chairman, so 
the portfolio was arbitrarily transferred to another man. Rizvi and Khan 
Mohammed are seeking redress in court.
    
When the 75-acre file arrived on the desk of Brigadier Hanifs successor, 
serving Brigadier Javed Gulzar Ahmed, General Manager in charge of civil 
works and estate, he categorically refused to recommend to the Trustees 
that the land be transferred to the Sindh government. He saw no reason to 
gift away a port asset, with a market value of around three billion rupees. 
He was immediately sent on a months leave, which he did not want and 
refused to take. His portfolio was transferred to another general manager, 
pliant and obedient Rasul Baksh Rahu, who did what he was told.
    
Three unscheduled hurriedly summoned Board meetings were then called and 
reportedly the 75 acres has once again been transferred to the Sindh 
government. This is not the end of the story. The port users are 
contemplating filing a writ and seeking an injunction.
    
One of the finest things Dawn has done is to print columns written by 
Benazir Bhutto. It helps the people to assess whether her thinking is 
juvenile, adolescent or mature. Her writings like those of others are 
subject to criticism and comment. I refer Benazir Bhutto, to her column, 
The power of mud (August 8). The 75 acres are not mud. They are for 
real. Let her make her own investigation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

AROUND this time of the year, all columnists and editorial writers worth 
their salt reflect on the state of the nation, and lament over how we are 
going to hell in a handbasket.
    
No Pakistani journalist has done so with greater lucidity or profundity 
than Mazhar Ali Khan during the dozen years he was with The Pakistan Times 
from Independence to 1959, when the paper was seized by Ayub Khans regime. 
We are fortunate that a collection of his editorials from this period has 
recently been published. A colleague from Lahore has quoted from one of 
them at length in a piece last week; I shall draw from another, not so much 
as a tribute to a journalist of total integrity and a man of great vision, 
but as a reminder of how little things have changed in the Land of the 
Pure.
    
Published on August 14, 1968, on the eve of Ayub Khans Decade of Reforms, 
this editorial reflects not only the national sense of despair and 
exasperation with our politicians, but also Mazhar Ali Khans innate 
optimism. Forty years on, the first two emotions have been strengthened, 
while the last one is in tatters. I hope readers will bear with me as I 
feel Khan Sahib deserves a full hearing, specially by those too young to 
have read his original editorials. (I must confess to falling into this 
category, but only just).
    
. . . For almost a decade now, the political arena has been the safe 
playground of men cursed with unlimited greed and gifted with limited 
ability. Every year has been a year of crisis, and every season the season 
of intrigue. It almost seems that the only stable factor in our political 
life has been a constant instability. Governments have come and gone with 
bewildering frequency . . .
    
Given this inbuilt instability, the economy was bound to suffer: Not 
surprisingly in these circumstances, Pakistan has drifted steadily toward 
economic ruin and political disaster; its agriculture languishes, its 
industry falters . . . Falling production and rising prices combine to make 
life increasingly [difficult] for the common man, while wasteful Government 
expenditure, the vulgar ostentation of the rich few, and the widespread 
corruption, add greatly to his bitterness.
    
But more than a keen observer of the national scene, Mazhar Ali Khan was a 
committed socialist who saw the West ruthlessly exploiting and controlling 
the Third World (a term that had not then entered the political lexicon). 
Although this is no longer a fashionable world view, there are many today 
who share his vision.
    
The editorial continues: Pakistans increasing economic dependence on 
foreign aid has . . . been matched by its rulers increasing reliance on 
western guidance and advice in formulating their policies . . . Pakistans 
. . . policy of siding almost always with the West . . . has . . . damaged 
(our) relations with the whole non-western world. On none of the issues 
which really matter to Pakistan - with Kashmir heading the list - have we 
received any sympathy or support from our Western friends . . .
    
Despite the writers disenchantment, his belief in democracy did not waver 
 and nor should ours. He concluded on this optimistic note: . . . The 
only relief in this dismal prospect is provided by the assurance that 
Pakistans first general elections will be held next year. . . It is quite 
possible that, confused by the clamour of the political market-place, the 
people will return to power many among those responsible for creating the 
present mess. . . . But one would like to hope that, even in the first 
election, the people will try to drive away from the seats of power all 
those who have been guilty of neglect or ineptness or worse. . . . they 
must realise that . . . in the affairs of the nation, tolerance of misrule, 
of corruption and bribery, and patience in the face of denial of their 
rights, are not virtues but weaknesses which sap the morale of the nation. 
. .
    
Clearly, voters have not heeded this advice. The same set of corrupt and 
inefficient politicians are returned to power in each election  and we 
have had five since this editorial was written. There are many influential 
voices today who argue that this reveals the fundamental weakness of 
parliamentary democracy as it has evolved in Pakistan. They ignore the fact 
that actually, ordinary people have used their vote to try and obtain the 
basic services they should be getting as a matter of right: roads, 
electricity, schools, jobs and so on. Because the state has failed to 
deliver, voters elect candidates who, in their perception, have a good 
chance of getting elected, and once in power, will have the clout to 
address their day-to-day problems. They do not care if the candidate is a 
thug; in fact, this would go in his favour as he is likely to be more 
effective. Thus, candidates tend to get elected because of their executive, 
and not their legislative, ability.
    
To a great extent, this distortion helps to explain the lota syndrome, in 
Pakistani politics. Apart from their personal ambitions and greed, 
politicians need to stay on the right side of the ruling party if they are 
to help their constituents and get re-elected. So they have no compunctions 
about selling out to the highest bidder whenever horse-trading is in 
progress. Not, of course, that there is much to choose from between the two 
major groupings in terms of ideology or level of corruption.
    
Having heard a distinguished voice from the past, let us listen (briefly 
this time, I promise) to an unknown one from our future. The following 
quotes are from a 20-year old Pakistani students political science paper 
for his college in America:
    
The changes that need to occur in Pakistan are so drastic in nature that 
the present government can in no way implement them as it does not have the 
political will to do so...The President would have to suspend the 
parliament...This contradicts my political philosophy...The changes that 
the President would have to make...would be to separate religion from 
politics and the judiciary... make the Hudood Ordinances 
unconstitutional... declare all religious parties illegal...negotiate with 
the MQM...[and] make an active effort to ensure a peace accord between the 
warring factions in Afghanistan...He should ensure that government funds 
are not misused...and set a 25-year prison term for dishonest 
officials....
    
The paper goes on to develop the young authors ideas on how to get the 
economy going and how to check population growth. in fact, I have edited 
some of his more extreme recommendations which include the liquidation of 
many of those who use religion and politics for their personal gain.
    
As his father, I am appalled by Shakirs complete disenchantment with our 
politicians and the whole political process. If his views reflect his 
generations  and I suspect they do  then we could not have a more 
damning indictment of what our leaders have been doing to this country. At 
least Mazhar Ali Khan hoped that the checks built into democracy would make 
it function effectively. For Pakistans youth, democracy is a system which 
allows crooked politicians to hang on to power, and which therefore cannot 
be redeemed.
    
But while I am horrified by some of Shakirs more extreme views, I am glad 
to report that he received an A for the paper.

<a name="isna">Is Nawaz Sharif really serious?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Malick

THE oppositions leap to the ultimate tactic of civil disobedience and 
that, too, in the absence of any ongoing massive street agitation, has 
raised more questions about the intention of those who wish to initiate it 
than any hopes about the ouster of the Benazir government.
    
Traditionally, civil disobedience campaigns have proven the logical 
culmination of a protracted public agitation and not the starting point of 
one, and, therefore, the opposition pronouncement poses the question: does 
Nawaz Sharif really mean it, or is it just another stalling measure to 
avoid taking matters to a point of no return or one of diminishing returns 
as far as his own personal political fortunes are concerned?
    
The dominant viewpoint in the federal capital tends to suggest the latter. 
A former cabinet secretary, known for his incisive political analysis, had 
this opinion to offer: Why should Nawaz Sharif rock the boat for 
unspecified changes? He has suffered personal losses running into crores 
during the last three years. Hes suffered personal traumas like the 
manhandling of his father whom he revers as a living saint.
   
Hes seen his brother and nephew go to jail, and now the family can boast 
of having gone to jail for democracy as well. With three years gone, that 
leaves him with two more years of Benazir rule to contend with. Why should 
he indulge in blind-turn politics?
    
The analysis continued: If things go as scheduled then 1998 should be the 
election year, and the election fever would be gripping the nation from the 
very first month. So that year should be counted out, leaving Nawaz Sharif 
with the question of what to do in 1997. He realises, like almost all 
political observers, that his best bet in ever returning to power lies in a 
fair general election. Does he, therefore, rock the boat just for the sole 
purpose of bringing down Benazir government and risk providing a ruse for 
an intervention of the third kind, with the danger of his own exclusion 
from any future power-structure, or does he bear out Benazir till hustings 
time? It makes all the sense for him to wait out this last phase.
    
But, of course, there is also the dilemma of Benazir making a clean sweep 
of the upper House if she is allowed to go on till March 1997, and this 
perhaps is one of the major concerns of the leader of the opposition.
    
It is also being argued by certain quarters critical of the leader of the 
opposition that the grudging teaming-up of Nawaz Sharif with an 
unpredictable firebrand maverick like Qazi Hussain Ahmed and the subsequent 
creation of an informal 14-party alliance may have been brought about by 
the same desire of not allowing the system to go down in an unpredictable 
manner.
    
This theory holds that by bringing together the unruly political mob in a 
hastily assembled vehicle with himself secured firmly in the drivers seat, 
Nawaz Sharif is trying to control the tenor and temperament of the anti-
government agitation and not allowing it to reach a feverish pitch as 
desired by the Jamaat leadership. It is a fact that ever since the 
formation of this alliance, the thrust of all opposition agitation has 
remained confined to fearsome sounding strategies and painting of stomach-
churning doomsday scenarios rather than real action on the ground.
    
Even the much-touted public rallies plan, supposedly being envisioned as a 
means of preparing the ground for the civil-disobedience movement, promises 
to prove little more than what it really is: a string of isolated public 
rallies.
    
These rallies would surely attract thousands of angry and disgruntled 
ordinary voters, but whether they would suffice to inculcate the level of 
intolerance and defiance required to implement a momentous decision like 
civil disobedience is anybodys guess.
    
Add to that the fact that on the one hand the opposition is talking of such 
extreme measures while on the other hand it remains divided over such basic 
decisions as when to resign from the assemblies, if at all. As if all this 
werent enough, rumours are rife about Oslo-like talks taking place between 
Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Zardari, only in this instance Oslo is no farther 
than the Faizabad residence of a prominent Muslim League leader. So far it 
remains an unconfirmed piece of political gossip, but in Pakistan, rumours 
have this uncomfortable habit of proving immature facts.
    
Fact or otherwise, but almost all allies of Nawaz Sharif are already 
discussing this rumour about a secret rapprochement, or the possibility of 
one, between the otherwise professed enemies like Benazir and Nawaz Sharif. 
And the impression is hurting Nawaz Sharif more than anybody else.
   
The situation is fast approaching a time where even the staunchest 
supporters are finding it increasingly hard to defend what his critics term 
his dilly-dallying stance over the launching of a truly aggressive street 
agitation. The time has now come where if Nawaz Sharif does not want to 
marginalise himself politically then he must decide between leading his 
troops into the streets or to the negotiating table.

<a name="whow">Who will clean the stables?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

AN idea which is receiving powerful support from some elements in the Press 
these days is for the present government to be sent packing and for an 
interim set-up to take its place for a period which may extend up to two 
years. During this period this interim set-up should carry out urgently-
needed reforms and only after the national stables have been cleaned should 
elections be held.
    
The rationale behind this proposal is that the country needs a new 
beginning because if the present rot in the affairs of the nation is 
allowed to continue, elections now or even after two years would be of 
little use. They would only lead to the replacement of the present corrupt 
order by another dispensation which if not equally corrupt would not be 
much different from it in its essential features. In recent days Mr Irshad 
Ahmed Haqqani, one of the countrys most persuasive columnists, has been 
advancing this idea in the columns of Jang. The Friday Times, which carries 
a powerful editorial voice, has also been advocating the benefits of mid-
term surgery.
    
Incidentally, it is perhaps not out of place to mention the circumstance 
that both Mr Haqqani and the Friday Times began as cautious admirers of Ms 
Bhuttos ruling circus, in the process often detecting the presence of 
virtue and sometimes of brilliance when more near-sighted observers could 
see nothing. That Ms Bhutto has succeeded in forfeiting the support (and 
well-meant support, let me hasten to add) of such well-wishers whose word 
carries weight in the national Press, as opposed to the propaganda drivel 
of partisans whose dishonest views only excite ridicule, is a measure of 
the distance she and her government have travelled since their second 
coming in 1993.
    
It goes without saying that in advocating mid-term change the proponents of 
this view put a burden on the shoulders of President Farooq Leghari because 
if he is not of a mind to use the constitutional powers at his disposal how 
is the government to be sent packing? The only other instrument of change 
is the army but having been down this road many times before it is hardly 
surprising if there is no voice rash enough to press for its intervention. 
So those quarters which are counselling the need for change, implicitly if 
not in so many words, are pinning their hopes on the President.
    
But in doing so they may be putting an unconscionable weight on his 
shoulders because, apart from misgivings sounded in private, there has been 
nothing in the Presidents conduct so far to justify any hopes of decisive 
action on his part. It was a sound instinct of self-preservation which 
goaded Zia to get rid of Junejo in 1988. Animus and blind prejudice rather 
than a concern for the national interest drove Ishaq to dismiss Benazir 
Bhutto in 1990 and Nawaz Sharif in 1993. Can it be said of Leghari that he 
has similarly powerful motives to strike at his own party, with whose 
survival his own interests are intertwined, and to make things more 
favourable for Nawaz Sharif with whom and with whose party he can have 
little emotional sympathy?
    
It can certainly be argued that the purpose of a change at this juncture 
will not be to make things smooth for Nawaz Sharif or anyone else but to 
carry out a cleansing of the political scene as a whole, a process which 
will encompass the opposition as much as it will the ruling party. But the 
execution of such a plan presupposes two qualities on the part of the 
President: the vision to understand its necessity and the will to carry it 
out. Can even the most fervent admirers of the President honestly bring 
themselves to say that he is possessed of these qualities? If, as is 
likely, they cannot, then how realistic is it to rest such tall 
expectations on such weak foundations?
    
That the country is in dire straits and that two more years of what it is 
now undergoing will leave it in a still more ruinous condition is something 
that has gained widespread currency as has the feeling that urgent measures 
are called for to arrest this trend. But what precisely must be done to set 
the nation on a new course is a question which, if at all it has to yield a 
practical answer, must be mindful of existing political realities. Of these 
realities none is more striking than the poverty of alternatives before the 
nation at present. Yes, change is desirable but how is it to be brought 
about? The army must not intervene; the president will not intervene. If 
this situation lasts we are left saddled by our present riders, the loud 
clamour of alarm bells notwithstanding.
    
True, the Press enjoys a position of influence today which it has not done 
since 1958. If there are effective voices in the Press which advocate a 
particular policy or a particular course of action this is bound to leave a 
residue of influence on the newspaper-reading public of which, let us not 
forget, the political class is also a part. But the Press is a trumpet or a 
loudspeaker. It is not a sword or a battle-axe (except, of course, in a 
metaphorical sense). It can advocate particular solutions but it has 
nothing at its disposal to implement them. The task of implementation rests 
with other actors on the political stage.
    
Nor must we forget that in Pakistan army chiefs and presidents have never 
performed their interventionist roles in a vacuum. Even the most ambitious 
or unscrupulous of them have profited from particular situations. The 
excuse for the 1958 coup lay in the political instability and the 
parliamentary game of musical chairs of the previous decade. For the 
military take-over in 1969 the excuse lay in the agitation which had 
erupted against the Ayub regime. In 1977 the army moved against Bhutto 
after six months of civil strife. Of the dismissals of Junejo, Benazir 
Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif mention has already been made. Unless something 
drastic or compelling happens now  like a civil agitation strong enough to 
bring the wheels of national life to a halt or an economic breakdown with 
similar consequences  it is stretching the bounds of probability to think 
that at this juncture history is set to repeat itself or that the 
Presidency as occupied by Farooq Leghari will transform itself dramatically 
into an interventionist fire-chamber.
    
Even otherwise, by what constitutional or legal manoeuvre do we get an 
interim period stretching beyond ninety days? Obviously, the Constitution 
is not going to be amended to bring this about. That leaves a sanction from 
the Supreme Court but the Supreme Court, as the law now stands, is in no 
position to give a sanction of this sort unless it is to break new judicial 
ground by taking refuge once again behind the Doctrine of Necessity  the 
same doctrine whose application in the past has served to justify the 
imposition of dictatorial rule in the country.
    
Another question also arises. Even if for the sake of argument it is 
assumed that a constitutional via media is found to get rid of the present 
dispensation and establish in its place an interim order charged with the 
responsibility of cleansing the Republic, from where are we going to get 
the high-minded reformers with both the ability and the integrity to carry 
out this task? And who is the philosopher-king who will choose these 
reformers? A revolution or a process of reform after all is only as good as 
the men and women who carry it out. Just as it is a chimerical idea to 
build a marble palace over a bed of manure, it becomes a fanciful notion to 
talk in terms of a great reform programme when we have no clear idea as to 
who the architects of this grand design are going to be.
 
To say as much is not to dismiss the necessity of a thorough spring-
cleaning in Pakistan but only to point out the matching necessity of 
keeping all such discussions firmly anchored in political reality. Our 
problem in any case is not simply the corruption of the political class but 
the corruption of the entire elite from which our governing class is drawn. 
Bureaucrats and public representatives, captains of war and captains of 
industry  all share equal responsibility for the mess in which the country 
finds itself.
    
It would be another matter if instead of quixotic saviours (of whom we have 
seldom had a shortage) there was a revolutionary party waiting in the 
wings. But Pakistan can count on no such luck. With all their gross 
imperfections, the alternatives we have are those that we see before us. 
Whether we like it or not it is only these that we can shuffle and 
reshuffle. Ms Bhutto is not only in power. She also has the mandate to rule 
for five years. The only force that can cut short this mandate is not the 
President exercising his lonely judgement or even the army stirring itself 
in the name of the national interest (because in the past we have had ample 
evidence of the imperfections of these judgements) but the power of the 
people. If the people rise to express their discontent then so be it. But 
if they choose to take what is being done to the country lying down, is any 
other force entitled to usurp their prerogative?

<a name="surr">Surrey back with a vengeance</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD: It looked like an absorbing courtroom scene from the hit drama 
series,  L. A. Law. 
    
Ashen-faced treasury members listened in rapt attention as Nawaz Sharif 
presented one circumstantial evidence after another to establish a link, 
even if indirect, between the ruling couple and the famous Surrey estate.
    
Both the prime minister and her spouse have been vehemently denying any 
involvement with the estate, right down to the point of claiming that they 
had been unaware even of the existence of the property till after the 
breaking of the scandal. But judging from the telephone records of the 
British telephone company presented by the leader of the opposition, 
someone sitting in the heart of that very mansion had surely made it a 
point to call some of the closest friends of the investment minister, Asif 
Zardari, to have fairly long chats with them.
    
One call has also been attributed to a mobile phone with a restricted 
number, which the opposition leader claimed had been in the personal use of 
Mr Zardari. One can only wonder why someone would bother going to such 
extremes and pay for long distance calls to people who had no interest in a 
particular piece of property.
    
An interesting feature of these calls, as claimed by Mr Sharif, is that 
almost all the numbers called are linked, directly and indirectly, to one 
of Mr Zardaris closest confidantes, Javed Pasha.
    
According to Mr Sharifs allegations, telephone number 01428-685-6072 was 
set up at the Surrey mansion, and all the claimed calls were made from that 
phone. Giving details of calls made between April 5 and April 19 of this 
year, he asserted that the calls were made to 042-5864260 (owned by DC 
Pager System, a Javed Pasha company), 021-5894172 (of the brother-in-law of 
Mr Pasha who happens to be a director of Shaheen TV, of which Mr Pasha is 
himself the chairman), and 0351-11880 (of the chief executive of NTM, whose 
chairman Tahir A. Khan publicly boasts of his friendship with Mr Zardari). 
    
Then, the leader of the opposition presented an unlisted mobile number, 
0300-550243, which had been allotted to DC Pager but was claimed to be in 
the personal use of Mr Zardari. Two calls were made to this number on April 
19, Mr Sharif asserted.
    
Judging from the quality of the oppositions information or disinformation, 
however, it was evident that the services of a professional detective 
outfit had been hired. Party insiders claimed that the spadework and hiring 
of the detectives etc. had been done by Ishaque Dar, who incidentally is 
still in London and finalising the next episode of what is being promised 
to prove the epilogue of this corruption serial.
    
Nawaz Sharif started off by giving the item wise breakdown of the 42 
cartons packed away in large wooden cases and weighing 3.5 tonnes that had 
been sent to Britain from Bilawal House, exempted from all customs charges 
and flown free by the national carrier.
    
Then spoke of another shipment, weighing 5,419 kgs, and dispatched from 
Lahore by one Sarosh Yaqub Mehdi and booked in the name of a man identified 
as Paul. This shipment lay unclaimed at Heathrow airport for weeks with no 
Mr Paul coming forward to claim it.
    
Quoting shipment bills and other documents, Nawaz Sharif claimed that Paul 
Keatings home address is the same as shown in the airway bill of the 
unclaimed shipment, and that he was the director of a Javed Pasha-linked 
company, Grant Bridge.
    
The day before, the opposition was clearly unimpressed by the governments 
decision to constitute an inquiry commission to identify big loan 
defaulters while the treasury benches wanted a pat on their backs.
    
Iftikhar Gillani hit the nail on the head when he expressed amazement that 
a fact finding mission was required to unveil the identities of the big 
players who had been sitting mum over Rs123 billion of the ordinary Joes 
hard-earned money.
    
Every bank and DFI has precise updated information regarding its loan 
exposures and current fiscal health, and it does not require a high profile 
and awesome sounding inquiry commission to ferret out this information 
about the criminals masquerading as defaulting businessmen. 
   
Mr Gillani had a simple solution for this lot, Jail without Bail as he 
put it.
    
And if anybody thought it to be an impossible task, Iftikhar Gillanis 
citing of a World Bank report should come, ironically, as a relief. This 
report has claimed that a mere 25 business houses/families could wreak 
havoc on the entire economic system of Pakistan. Twisting the same argument 
around, one could argue that by making these 25 big fish clear the economic 
waters that they had sullied, Pakistans major economic ills could well be 
cured. The recovery process must start from somewhere, and 25 seems just 
the perfect manageable figure.
    
Listening to the minister of state for law, Raza Rabbani, however, it 
appeared that the announced commission would mean the death knell for the 
financially corrupt elite. 
   
With all due respect to his impressive oratory skills, the minister would 
have done well to explain just how in heavens did he expect this commission 
to conduct fair and honest investigations. He tried instilling the fear of 
god by insisting that the commission would be manned by men of unquestioned 
integrity. Granted, but what about the inherent limitations imposed by the 
very act under which this commission would be constituted.
    
The commission would be formed under the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry 
Act 1956, which clearly stipulates that its members would be deemed to be 
public servants. May be Raza Rabbani knows of any public servant who is 
free of the incumbent governments influence because the remaining 120 
million people this corrupt system surely do not.
    
Asfandyar Wali had his point when he pointed out that every time a 
government desired an issue to be swept under the carpet, it formed a 
commission. Naming the Hamoodur Rehman Commission, again headed by a man of 
unquestionable integrity to borrow Raza Rabbanis phrase, he rightly 
lamented that no one knew a word about that commissions finding till this 
day.
    
Quite a few treasury members could be heard agreeing to the oppositions 
point of view that the government knew all that it needed to know about the 
loan defaulter mafia, but what it lacked was a sincere will to take action, 
and not the information. 
   
The bank reports are there, the list prepared by the Moeen Qureshi 
government is there if only the government was serious about its professed 
plans.

<a name="paki">Pakistan confident as final Test starts today</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, Aug 21: Unlike the last series in 1992, Pakistan arrive at The Oval 
with a 1-0 advantage in the series. Psychologically they are a lot more 
confident for the decisive third and final Test than they had ever been on 
a tour of England. The mood and their intentions of a positive approach to 
go in the final Test starting tomorrow (Thursday) was quite clear while 
they were in the nets for the pre-match practice session.
    
Mobbed by the media and the autograph-hunters they paid little attention to 
what was going around them. Everyone had their turn at the nets. The 
batsmen and the bowlers all appeared lively and vivacious in their workouts 
for the big event and they all realise that if they sign off with another 
win, they will be hailed as the best outfit that ever came to England from 
Pakistan.
    
The captain, Wasim Akram, maintains that if there is a result at The Oval 
it will most likely be in favour of his team. We have the right blend, we 
are one match up and also we are in form. There is very little chance of 
anything going drastically wrong.
    
In the county games and in the last two Tests we have shown that we have 
the capacity to recover and absorb the shock, says Wasim.
    
There is a lot of runs in this Oval wicket and our batsmen have now a lot 
of experience on this tour; so there is no reason why we are not able to 
make a good score, the Pakistan captain says.

<a name="maji">Majid terms Council decisions principled</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Aug 18: The Chief Executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), 
Majid Khan, dismissed claims that the replacement of the National Selection 
Committee was against the constitution of the PCB.
    
Who says it is against the constitution? Majid asked when he was 
contacted at his Lahore residence.
    
It has been done according to the constitution and the Executive Council 
has done it, Majid added.
    
When Majid was asked that the Council never had the authority to replace 
the Selection Committee and it was the General Body which had been vested 
powers by the constitution, Majid said: It is not so. It is the Executive 
Council which can take such decisions.
    
Majid emphasised that it has been a unanimous decision of the Executive 
Council.
    
However, well placed sources said that two councillors, Nusrat Azeem and 
Yar Mohammad Solangi, had objected to the change giving reference of the 
constitution and later recorded their note of dissent in the minutes of the 
meeting after the decision was made.

LONDON, Aug 20: India had an emphatic four-wicket win over Pakistan in the 
Lombard Under-15 World Challenge. Chasing 223 to win, India cruised to 
victory with 3.2 overs to spare.
    
The hero of Indias well-deserved win in the juniors tournament was their 
captain Reetinder Sodhi who scored an unbeaten 82 to steer India to a 
memorable victory at Lords. Reetinder Sodhi struck six fours in his match-
winning knock to destroy any aspirations that Pakistan youngsters had of 
winning this competition. This was Pakistans first defeat in the contest.
    
A crowd of 8,000 watched the days play which was also attended by former 
Test cricketers and the Pakistan team which visited the ground when 
Pakistan were batting.
    
Pakistan bowlers showed bad form and fielded poorly which could be gauged 
from the fact they conceded 38 extras of which 28 were wide balls. Jan 
Nisar Khan bowled 12 of them.

<a name="hani">Hanif wants new and strong hockey side to be raised</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Walter Fernandez

KARACHI, Aug. 19: The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) without losing time 
should embark on the task of putting its house in order and top priority 
should be given to prepare a worthy squad to defend the World Cup in about 
two years time, said Hanif Khan, former Pakistan Captain and Coach in an 
exclusive interview to `Dawn here on Monday.
    
To begin with, the PHF should axe about six to seven members of the squad 
that performed dismally in this years Atlanta Olympic Games, having placed 
sixth  the lowest ever position since the country first participated in 
the 1948 London Olympic Games, opined one of the greatest inside-lefts 
modern hockey has ever seen and the man who has over 21 years experience on 
artificial surface.
    
When I was the coach of the team under the stewardship of another former 
Pakistan Captain and Olympian Khalid Mahmood during the 1993 Kaula Lumpur 
Champions Trophy, where Pakistan had staged a below average show, on return 
home I had called for the sacking of six experienced stars on the grounds 
that they were well past their prime, stated Hanif Khan.
    
Because I was of the opinion that with two years in hand before the 1996 
Olympics, there was sufficient time to groom a squad capable of regaining 
the Olympic gold medal after 12-long years. But the PHF hesitated at then 
and let the status quo remain, added the former Pakistan captain.
    
Then with Pakistan managing to regain the Champions Trophy at Lahore after 
14 years in early 1994 and the Sydney World cup after 13 years, in December 
of the same year, with freak victories in penalty stroke shoot-outs, the 
players in the twilight of their careers were allowed to hang on till the 
Olympics and the ultimate result is known to all and sundry, explained 
former Olympian Hanif Khan, a member of the last Pakistan Olympic gold 
medal winning team in 1984 at Los Angeles.

VUGHT, Aug 18: Pakistans crop of young hockey players laid themselves a 
solid foundation for the future by winning the VolvoTrophy in a four-nation 
tournament for players of under-21.
    
In the final Pakistan defeated Germany 2-1 after extra time, having beaten 
them by the same score in normal time during the round-robin to build a 
team for the future with an eye on the Junior World Cup at Milton Keynes in 
September 1997.
    
After a blank and evenly-fought first half Pakistan opened the scoring in 
the 47th minute with a field goal by Haider Hussain. The match seemed to be 
in Pakistans grasp until the 61st minute when Germany hit back with a goal 
from a short corner by Max Klink who has had experience of English first 
division hockey.
 
Both sides strove mightily for the match-winner but full time arrived with 
no further score. The match went into a sudden-death period of extra time 
which ended with Ali Raza scoring what is now termed as the golden goal 
in the ninth minute. So ended an exciting match.
