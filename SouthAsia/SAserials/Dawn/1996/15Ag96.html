<a name="oppo">Opposition to launch disobedience movement</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: The 14-party alliance warned the government here to 
either resign immediately or face a full-fledged civil disobedience 
movement.
    
The possible extreme step was announced by the Leader of the Opposition, 
Nawaz Sharif, at a press conference after the conclusion of the alliance 
meeting which was attended by the heads and representatives of the member-
parties.
    
The meeting was called to approve the recommendations of the alliances 
special committee.
    
A visibly angry Mr Sharif said: It has been unanimously decided that if 
the government does not resign immediately, a civil disobedience movement 
will be launched against it. People will stop paying taxes and utility 
bills.
    
Emphasising that the movement would be taken to its logical conclusion, he 
said the opposition would not hesitate in submitting en masse resignations 
from the national and provincial assemblies.
    
Replying to a question, he, however, refused to name a specific date for 
launching of the movement, and said: The decision will come at an 
appropriate time.
    
Mr Sharif also announced an exhaustive opposition schedule of public 
rallies which would form an important part of the oppositions Pakistan 
Bachao Tehrik.
    
Besides the already announced public rallies of Aug 14 and 19 in Karachi 
and Quetta, respectively, another will be held in Peshawar on Aug 25. These 
rallies will be followed by three more  on Aug 28 in Karachi, Aug 31 in 
Lahore and Sept 3 in Quetta.
    
When asked if the opposition seriously expected the government to step down 
at the oppositions request, a flustered Mr Sharif responded: Its a 
shameless government. Having faced such a massive strike and others which 
are taking place every day, any democratic government would have either 
resigned or at least sat with the opposition to negotiate. This government 
simply has no respect for the feelings and aspirations of the people of 
Pakistan.
    
Accusing the government of looting the national exchequer and plundering 
national resources, he said the government was misusing public money and, 
therefore, could not be trusted with the money coming in through taxes and 
utility bills. The opposition leader charged that the tax money was being 
pocketed by certain elements as commission.
    
To a query, he replied that the opposition wanted a change in the system 
and not merely of faces.
    
Mr Sharif lamented that the country was faced with economical, judicial and 
social crises while there had been a complete breakdown of the law and 
order situation. Under these circumstances, he intoned, it was morally 
binding on the opposition to lead the nation out of the morass.
    
When asked why the opposition had not appealed to the President once again, 
he testily replied: We cannot leave the people at the mercy of just one 
man, well find our own ways.
    
The meeting also decided to open central and provincial offices of the 
Pakistan Bachao Tehrik, to maintain close contact with the people.

<a name="mpas">MPAs gunmen open fire on citizen</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

GUJRANWALA, Aug 12: A citizen was manhandled and shot at by the gunmen of 
an MPA over a minor issue here.

Reportedly, a car bearing an MPA plate was wrongly parked near the 
Satellite Town market, hampering the smooth flow of traffic. Nadeem Ahmad, 
a resident of the DC Road, passed by there in his car and objected to the 
wrong parking.

Two gunmen sitting in the car became enraged. They beat up Nadeem with the 
butts of guns, and fired at him.

He was severely injured and was admitted to the local Civil Hospital in 
critical condition.

Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Aug 9: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto announced here that she had 
called for making revolutionary changes in the local bodies system.
    
Speaking at a Press conference she disclosed that every village in the 
country would have three multiple votes to elect three representatives each 
who would oversee development and would also act as a court with powers of 
awarding a maximum two years sentence. Thus justice would be available to 
the rural population at its doorsteps in every village.
    
Ms Bhutto also announced that a certain formula would be adopted by Punjab 
for collection of agricultural income tax. The formula based on the old 
system of land revenue had been communicated to the provincial government. 
Under the system part of the collections would be spent on improvement of 
irrigation, agriculture and construction of farm-to-market roads.

<a name="pmli">PM links CTBT with Kashmir issue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Aug 9: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has said that Pakistan will 
not create hurdles in the passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty 
(CTBT), but will not become a party to it unless India agrees to sign the 
treaty. She said her own security concerns in the regional perspective had 
been duly recognised by the world.
    
Answering newsmens questions at a Press conference on the conclusion of 
her four-day visit to NWFP and parts of the Federally Administered Tribal 
Areas, the prime minister told a questioner that the parliament had already 
been taken into confidence on the subject. She said oppositions stand on 
the CTBT was confused and many of them even dont know what the 
abbreviation CTBT stands for, hence little weight in their contentions 
which was a mere propaganda ploy.
    
She underscored the importance of the treaty in the regional and global 
context and insisted that there should be a stop to proliferation but at 
the same time the approach should be realistic keeping view of Pakistans 
security concerns vis-a-vis the Indian posture. She thought that by 
dragging her feet on the treaty India stood exposed in the international 
community.
    
While Pakistans approach had remained positive throughout, India had 
adopted a negative policy. Every one now realises that Pakistans stand 
was realistic and this has absolved this country of all incriminations in 
relation to ban on nuclear proliferation in the world. She highly praised 
the role the Pakistan delegation played at Geneva where the CTBT was being 
debated. Ms Bhutto said Pakistan welcomed a regional and multilateral 
solution of the problem which Indian was openly resisting and obstructing 
the passage of the treaty.

<a name="shut">Shutdown hits life all over country </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 10: Life came to a near-halt and industrial and commercial 
activity was severely affected as traders on Saturday observed a country-
wide strike which was also backed by the opposition parties.
    
The leading trading organisations of the country had given a two-day strike 
call to protest against the levy of General Sales Tax and Excise Duty in 
the recent national budget. Almost all the opposition parties led by 
Pakistan Muslim League had announced to support the trading community in 
their protest.
    
Wholesale and retail businesses across the country responded with a near-
complete trading shut-down in major cities in all the four provinces of the 
country.
    
Most of the government departments, commercial establishments and banks 
were closed on the normal Friday and Saturday weekend holidays. Attendance 
in other offices and in schools and colleges was, however, thin as most of 
public transport vehicles stayed off the roads.

<a name="paki">Pakistan trade office in LA served with eviction notice </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Aug 10: Pakistans trade office in Los Angeles, opened with 
tremendous fanfare last year, has been served with eviction notice by the 
landlord demanding payment of outstanding rent, while the Commercial 
Counsellor Abid Javed Akbar left suddenly for Pakistan without permission 
either from the embassy or the consulate here.
    
Highly informed sources said that despite dozens of S.O.S. messages and 
phone calls, both from the Pakistan Embassy in Washington and the Consulate 
in Los Angeles, the Ministry of Commerce has not bothered to acknowledge 
the financial crisis gripping its trade office.
    
In the eviction notice served on the Pakistan Trade Office, the landlord of 
the building located on Wilshire Boulevard said if three months back rent 
$9000 was not paid by Aug 6 he would ask the police department to forcibly 
evict the tenants according to terms of the lease agreement.
    
Besides, the two trade assistants given the Commercial Counsellor, Mr 
Shahid Ali, and Mr M. Butt, have been asked to pay $20,000 in back rent by 
the motel they were staying in for the last six months. So far Pakistani 
Consulate has been bailing out the trade office and their officers, but it 
is also running out of money and patience.

<a name="9930">9930kg of hashish seized </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

<a name="runo">Run on foreign currency account deposits ruled out</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: About 65% of the amount in foreign currency accounts has 
been collateralised, rendering a run on these deposits impossible under any 
circumstances, banking circles said.
    
These circles were responding to the increasing fears being expressed by 
some leading economists that the continuing free fall of the rupee over the 
last several weeks would end up in a run on the foreign currency accounts 
deposits forcing the country to default and causing the economy to 
collapse.
    
An estimated 9 billion dollars have flowed in these foreign currency 
accounts held by local and expatriate Pakistanis as well as foreign and 
local companies since foreign exchange controls were lifted in early 1991. 
No separate account of these deposits are being kept by the State Bank of 
Pakistan and from the very beginning, these accounts have been merged with 
the overall foreign exchange reserves of the country which till the lifting 
of the foreign exchange controls had been made up of export earnings, short 
and long-term loans, concessional assistance, balances held outside and 
gold.
    
Availing the facility allowed for borrowing against dollars, local and 
foreign investors are said to have used their dollar deposits as collateral 
for rupee loans for investment in short, medium and long gestation 
projects.
    
In such a situation the possibility of a serious run on dollar deposits is 
being ruled out as it would take a while before one can convert ones 
rupees into dollars before taking them out of the country. 
   
And a sudden rush on the rupee by say millions of dollars, all at the same 
time which is the normal manifestation of a run, would push the rupee rate 
steeply  up making the whole exercise totally unprofitable.
    
Some market analysts have pointed out that many dollar depositors were 
raking in multiple profits by converting the rupees borrowed against 
dollars into dollars and then depositing these dollars in fresh foreign 
exchange accounts. 
   
They keep repeating the exercise till the last ounce has been squeezed from 
the spread provided by the margin on dollar deposits.

<a name="rupe">Rupee lowered 12 paisa against $</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 13: The rupee was devalued by 12 paisa against the US dollar 
on Tuesday what the central bank called technical correction to keep its 
parity rate competitive on the world markets in relation to basket of major 
currencies under the managed float system.
    
It was the fifth and the largest downward revision since July 1, 1996, 
which took the value of the rupee lower by 43 paisa or 1.5 per cent and 
currency dealers predicted it is heading for its set target of Rs 38.00 to 
a dollar before December 31.
    
However, on the open market the rupee was not that weak as the US dollar is 
said to be in oversupply since the rupee touched the bottom at Rs 38.50 
last week.
    
In official trading, the rupee was quoted at Rs 35.53 and Rs 35.71 for spot 
buying and selling but in kerb dealings its value was lowered to Rs 38.57 
and Rs 38.60 in that order.

The widening trade gap, which has swelled to $270 million in July from $95 
million a month back, speaks of the alarming situation on the export front, 
economists said.
    
The creeping devaluations might have no relevance to the falling exports 
or to boost them but seems to be essentially meant to meet the IMF demand, 
they added.
    
There is loud whispering in the money markets that the value of the rupee 
is expected to be lowered by another 3 per cent before December 31, as 
demanded by the IMF, and that will mean in kerb the rupee could hit the 
current years bottom at Rs 40 to a dollar.

<a name="budg">Budget: up against feudal obduracy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

THE ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES of the Punjab are destroying Pakistans economy 
by consistently opposing tax on income from agriculture. What they do not 
realise, however, is in the process they are destroying the economy of 
their own province and, in fact their own personal prosperity to protect 
and promote which they are resisting the imposition of an equitable tax in 
the first place.
    
At the time of making of the new budget, the federal government had assured 
the IMF that this time around it was determined to withdraw all tax 
exemptions, including that from agricultural incomes. On this assurance, 
the Fund had indicated that as a trade-off it would not press for tariff 
reductions for at least another year.
    
However, the federal government had not reckoned with the brute political 
brawn of the brainless elected representatives of Pakistans biggest 
province, the Punjab as when the time came for the provinces to pass the 
needed legislation, the Punjab thumbed its nose.
    
And with the judicial activism giving ideas to the ousted Chief Minister of 
Punjab, Wattoo, and the Indians retaliating in the Punjab cities against 
what New Delhi alleges to be Pakistan- inspired terrorist activities in 
occupied Kashmir, the room for Islamabad to play politics to knock the 
brains of the Punjab legislators into appreciating the economic grossness 
of their resistance to tax on agriculture income had become too small.
    
In view of the above, the budget for 1996-97 has become a document of 
deepening economic distortions. On the one hand the rural rich have been 
exempted from contributing a single penny to the national efforts in 
connection with security, development and debt servicing while on the other 
the tax evasion scope for the urban rich is being attempted to be curtailed 
drastically by forcing them to document their businesses by imposing GST 
across the board. This is not to say that the GST should not have been 
imposed across the board, but what is being implied is along with it the 
incomes from agriculture should also have been taxed to make the taxation 
system more equitable and the base itself broader.
    
Again, while the increase in the rates of sales tax to 18 to 23 per cent, 
withdrawal of all sales tax exemptions and enhancement in the rates of 
central excise duties have brought the prices of goods of urban consumption 
under greater pressure the prices of those items which are consumed more in 
the rural areas have remained more or less untouched by the new measures. 
Again, this is not to say that the prices of rural consumption items should 
have been increased at par with those of the urban consumption items, but 
what is being focused is the deepening of the rural-urban economic 
contradictions because of the non- imposition of the tax on agricultural 
incomes.
    
The IMF had allowed the government a one-year moratorium on the tariff 
reduction issue mainly because the government wanted to ensure that revenue 
incomes do not get affected by the expected dislocations in the wake of 
massive reforms being attempted in the new budget.
    
However, when finally informed that the Punjab province had not agreed to 
the withdrawal of tax exemption from agricultural incomes, the Fund found 
an appropriate excuse to drag its feet on the issue of disbursement of the 
remaining tranches of the $600 million 15-month standby loan signed in 
December 1995. If these tranches are not disbursed before September, the 
government is likely to face a serious situation on the balance of payments 
position front as by then the country would be required to meet a billion 
dollars of amortisation obligations besides an import bill of an equal 
amount.
    
The Fund is also not very happy with the concessions agreed upon between 
various sections of the economy and the government representatives not 
belonging to the finance and economic ministries.
    
The governments decision to induct Mr Asif Ali Zardari as a federal 
minister for investment appears to be too late and too irrelevant because 
most of the concessions offered to the business community were made by Mr 
Zardari in his capacity as chairman of the Pakistan Environmental Council. 
In the same capacity he had chaired a number of finance and commerce 
summits with the business community last year giving the latter the 
impression that the government was willing to give them concessions 
directly opposed to the IMFs reforms.
    
Meanwhile, those disgruntled elements in the government who were kept out 
of the budget making process this year personally went to the Fund 
headquarters in Washington to give their version of the taxation proposals 
which implied that the CBR would not be able to collect fully the revenues 
as estimated in the 1996-97 budget.
    
The failure of the government to adhere to the bank borrowing target of Rs. 
29 billion fixed for 1995-96 budget and its attempt to mislead the Fund on 
this score on a month-to-month basis has also caused the credibility of the 
government to suffer seriously in the eyes of the Fund officials.
    
In view of these circumstances, it is being feared that the Fund review 
mission would not come to Pakistan before the first week of October. By 
this time, the Fund expects Pakistan to impose tax on agricultural incomes, 
show that it has successfully resisted the pressure from the street to 
bring about a qualitative change in the new budget and also show that the 
government has not borrowed from the banks more than what has been fixed 
for the first three months for budgetary support.
    
The Fund is, however, likely to take a lenient view of the whole thing on 
the advice of the US if in the meanwhile, Islamabad were to sign the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty(CTBT) as per the desire of Washington. But 
would the elected representatives of the Punjab like to see Pakistans 
security needs compromised simply to protect and promote their personal 
pelf?

FOREIGN investors in Pakistan are complaining of shortage of trained and 
skilled workers for their sophisticated methods of production, particularly 
in the automobile sector. 
   
And that is discouraging the substantial rise in foreign investment in the 
manufacturing sector where they employ advanced technology.
    
More surprising is the lack of interest of the government in welcoming 
advanced foreign-aided technical training institutions in this age of 
communications revolution and high tech, and making full use of 
institutions like the Swiss Design Institute in Karachi established some 20 
years ago or more and in expanding it.
    
And this is happening despite the fact that it has been conclusively proved 
that major foreign investors prefer making large investments in countries 
with skilled workers and competent managers than in countries with simply 
cheap unskilled labour.
    
The figures for direct foreign investment for 1995 show that such 
investment increased by 46 per cent over 1994 or by $ 103 billion more and 
$ 216 billion out of that went to the developed countries and developing 
countries received $ 97 billion, which is considered an all-time high by 
UNCTAD.
    
What that shows is funds on a vast scale are on the move globally for 
investment, and countries that offer the best terms and have the best 
political, economic and social environment would get the largest share of 
those funds. Out of that Pakistan got a trickle last year, primarily for 
power production and in the oil exploration sector.
    
A study by the Doilette and Touch Consulting Group also showed that out of 
$ 97 billion of US foreign direct investments made last year, 75 per cent 
went to high wage countries beginning with Sweden, Britain and Brazil.
    
Last week when Mr. Nisar Memon of the IBM Pakistan held a meeting of his 
new IBM Forum with former ambassador Najamus Saquib addressing it on the 
role of human and social capital in national progress, Mr. Ikeda, General 
Manager of Itochu Corporation of Japan, who has spent many years in 
Pakistan, said that five Japanese automobile assembling companies in 
Pakistan were handicapped by the fact its workers could not read their 
manuals and work efficiently as they were illiterate.
    
Mr. Okada, who buys a great deal of Pakistani yarn and textile for Japan, 
also said while Pakistani tailors could stitch cloth straight fast they 
found it difficult when they had to stich in a curve.
    
In contrast to that I was told at the Aircraft Re-build Factory at Kamra 
about 50 miles north of Islamabad, that its workers could read their 
aircraft-making manuals supplied by the Chinese. The reason could well be 
that as employees of the Pakistan Air Force were literate workers.
    
The fact is that production in Pakistan both by the foreign investors and 
major Pakistani companies is getting more and more sophisticated and 
computerised. But many workers are not educated or do not have adequate 
literacy. And that handicaps them as much as their companies.
    
Machines imported by Pakistani producers are getting more and more 
sophisticated. While modern machines driven by computers need few workers, 
they need skilled workers who are educated and that is in acute short 
supply in Pakistan.
    
I am told of a Japanese government offer to set up an advanced technical 
training institute in Islamabad to fill the void but the response from the 
students had been disappointing and the very useful project has been in 
doldrums for long.
    
In Japan they have the famous Quality Circles in which workers sit together 
and suggest improvements in the method of production and product 
improvement. Japan unlike Pakistan has a very small number of supervisors 
but in Pakistan nothing much happens without vigilant supervision at a high 
cost.

Japans trend
    
That remarkably successful system of Japan is now being imitated by some of 
the German firms facing export problems which want to improve their 
competitiveness. In the famous Carl Zeiss company in Jena, East Germany, 
which is 150 year old and exports medical equipment, binoculars and 
photographic lenses worth 2.5 billion Duetch Marks, I saw groups of workers 
sitting together in several rooms Monday morning as the factory re-opened 
after the week-end holidays and discussing improvements in the light of 
their previous weeks or months experience.
    
With more and more sophisticated machinery coming into Pakistan, including 
in the textile sector, the need of the times is both literacy or education 
of the workers and sustained technical training and retraining of the 
trained old workers, if productivity has to go up and Pakistans exports 
are to become more competitive and exports rise to the modest target of 10 
billion dollars this year.
    
But, the government does not have money to import education or set up 
adequate number of technical training schools. And yet (he need of the 
industries for adequately trained workers is desperate. The best solution 
in such an environment is the remarkably successful German Apprentice 
Scheme which takes care of the needs of the young at one end and of the 
industry and service sectors at the other.
    
The apprenticeship scheme is as old as modern German industry and the 
federal and state governments and the companies make their contribution to 
it 90 per cent of the youngsters who end their general schooling at junior 
secondary or intermediate level go into vocational training that lasts for 
two to three years. Vocational training comprise both practical on-the-job 
learning and theoretical instruction in vocational schools where they are 
trained and spend one to three days a week.
    
The federal government is responsible for the training regulations, while 
the state governments set up the vocational schools and the factories 
impart the practical training. Germany has about 400 recognised occupations 
for which formal training is required.
    
The trainees receive a training remuneration which is sizeable and goes on 
increasing every year and finally most of the trainees join the same 
company and rise high. Over 500,000 firms are part of this system. After 
the training examinations are held by chambers of commerce before they are 
given certificates which are essential for getting jobs, if they have not 
qualified themselves for their jobs through higher education or training. 
In addition to such vocational training schools, there are also full-time 
specialised vocational training schools where the students receive at lest 
one-years full training.
    
The Germans are pretty proud of this system and hold it as the backbone of 
the success of their economy, particularly the industrial and services 
economies. Pakistan needs such a system to increase the number of 
technically trained personnel at a low cost, but unfortunately the 
supervisors in factories who have to impart training to the new entrants 
are not educated.
    
And the general tendency of the students is to get a general degree from 
one of the colleges if they could not get admission to one of the 
professional colleges become a doctor or engineer or business graduate.
    
In fact, many of the owners of factories are not educated either, and may 
not be too keen on imparting proper training to apprentices who may seek 
employment in that factory after the completion of the training or not.
    
And now too many young persons are going for computer training, but not of 
a high order or intensive training.
    
A recent report of the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank 
affiliate, says foreign direct investment will seek out developing 
countries that offer managers and skilled workers rather than just low cost 
production labour.
    
It says that low direct labour costs have been diminishing its importance 
in recent years and in many industries direct labour costs now only account 
for 10 to 15 per cent of the manufacturing cost, and the share is even 
smaller in some industries.
    
Clearly what matters is skilled and trained labour and not the simple 
unskilled cheap labour available in abundance in Pakistan. What foreign 
investors need is skilled and trained labour which is more easily available 
in India or Sri Lanka where the rate of literacy is higher and the quality 
of education better.

<a name="citi">Citizens status being upgraded by Tax Cards</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 11: The taxpayers will soon have Tax Cards identical to 
prestigious bank credit cards. This additional service, is a measure by the 
Central Board of Revenue (CBR) to upgrade the social status of its clients.
    
The taxpayer will not mind to expose it to the non-tax payers, the newly 
designed light blue tax cards magnificently coated in plastic covers as it 
could well add to their sense of pride.
    
The Central Board of Revenue has already, according to the information 
available from the regional tax collectorate, arranged the distribution of 
0.350 Tax Cards in the major cities during the next couple of days. The 
card is priced at Rs 50 each.
    
Any price is not that big for the taxpayer, as even those who do not fall 
into tax net, or who pay only a meagre amount would like to have one, said 
an industrialist who had seen the card.
    
It is a CBR bait but an attractive one to net the hidden income groups to 
the tax net , said an exporter adding, but it is not a bad idea to have 
one at Rs 50 and obtain exemption from the Capital Value Tax (CVT).

Sources at the regional income tax collectorate said about a million tax 
cards will be available during the next few weeks and will be issued to 
those who have already National Tax Number (NTN).

<a name="borr">Borrowings in 18 days surpass years goal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12; In the first 18 days of the current financial year, the 
government has borrowed Rs38.6 billion against the full year target of Rs20 
billion and an actual expansion of Rs24.2 billion in the corresponding 
period last year.
    
According to a State Bank report on liquidity and domestic borrowing which 
was discussed here at the ECC meeting, the domestic credit expansion was to 
the tune of 2.64 per cent (Rs23.9 billion) during the period under review 
compared with an expansion of 2.08 per cent (Rs15.8 billion) in the 
corresponding period last year.
    
The net foreign assets of the banking system showed a depletion of Rs16.8 
billion by July 18, 1996 compared with a draw down of Rs13.4 billion in the 
corresponding period of the previous year.
    
The movement in net foreign assets of the banking system thus neutralised 
nearly 70 per cent of the expansionary impact of domestic credit so that 
money supply expanded by 0.81 per cent (Rs7 billion) up to July 18, 1996 
compared with an expansion of 0.32 per cent (Rs2.4 billion) in the same 
period last year.
    
Borrowings for commodity operations showed a contraction of Rs3.7 billion 
up to July 18, 1996. Following the seasonality pattern, the credit to the 
private sector (including public sector commercial enterprises) registered 
a contraction of Rs7. 5 billion compared with a contraction of Rs0.6 
billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. Other items (net) 
of the banking system were also contractionary to the extent of Rs3.5 
billion.
    
The ECC was informed that the financial year 1995-96 ended with a total 
bank borrowing of Rs41.6 billion against the full year target of Rs28.1 
billion.

<a name="land">Landlords pay Rs2.82m only in Wealth Tax</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: The landed gentry surrendered during 1995-96 a total 
amount of Rs 2.826 million on account of wealth tax on their agricultural 
assets, which was 0.0036 per cent of total proceeds from direct taxes, 
according to the statistics made available by the Central Board of Revenue, 
Chairman Alvi Abdul Rehman at a press conference here on Tuesday.
    
In absolute terms, it was some improvement over 1994-95 when 1764 landlords 
had paid a total amount of Rs 2.391 million. A table provided by him shows 
that the number of agricultural tax payers under the Wealth Tax head 
increased from 1764 to 2457 between the two financial years, while the 
collection also improved from Rs 2.391 million to Rs 2.826 million.
    
The good news ends there, however. For a grim fact that an analysis of 
these figures brings out is that the average of amount paid by each 
agricultural tax-payer declined from Rs 1355 in 1994-95 to Rs 1150 in 1995-
96. As a proportion of total direct tax proceeds also, the share of 
agricultural assets wealth dropped from 0.0038% to 0.0036% between the two 
years. The share of agricultural taxpayers in total wealth tax proceeds 
also decreased from 1.5% to 1.4%.

<a name="thee">The economy needs its own foreign policy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi

THERE WAS a small news item the other day that spoke about a visiting 
Japanese business leader, Mr. Shigemasa Kisara, the chief executive of the 
famous Nichimen Corporation, having met a Pakistani business leader. He met 
with Senator Ilyas Bilour, the Chairman of the FPCCI (Federation of 
Pakistan Chamber of Commerce & Industry). They discussed Pakistan - Japan 
relations and it was decided that the next meeting of the Pakistan-Japan 
Business Council should be held early next year.
    
Japan of course is one of the most important trading partners of Pakistan. 
We export a great deal to Japan and also import a great many things from 
them, needless to emphasise they are an economic superpower.
    
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited Japan earlier in the year and a 
number of the MoUs, worth $ 900 million, were signed during the visit. An 
aid package was also signed worth $ 875 million.
    
Japan still occasionally makes grants for certain deserving causes in this 
country. 
   
Except for minor trade frictions occasioned by its imposition of the 
countervailing duties on some Pakistani goods, mainly yarn, on the charge 
of Pakistanis dumping some of their excess production (selling at below 
cost prices), relations with Japan are on the whole excellent.
    
However, it cannot be said that Pakistanis have conducted their economic 
relations with Japan with any foresight, intelligence or purposefulness. 
They have allowed sheer compulsion of events to shape the nature and extent 
of the ties.
    
Our trade relations with Japan have been determined by two main factors: 
Japans own drive for export and secondly our need to appease the 
unsatiable hunger for foreign goods especially high quality consumer 
durables like colour TVs, ACs, VCRs and cars. Our choice of Japanese goods 
was because of their better quality and reasonable prices. Pakistanis have 
not tried to court the Japanese half as seriously as they wooed the 
Americans and Europeans.

Lost Opportunities
    
*From Japans point of view, Pakistan is one of its minor trading partners. 
For them, Pakistan is not a major market for their excess capital for a 
variety of reasons. Among these there are all sorts of shortcomings in this 
country as a market for foreign direct investments arising out of 
insufficiency, inefficiency and inappropriateness of infrastructure, 
bureaucratic delays, over-regulation and a frequent law and order break-
down.
    
The Pakistan-Japan Business Council has met earlier. What did those 
meetings achieve? Can it be said that Pakistanis have made maximum use of 
Japans need to export capital, know-how and goodwill? No, it is not so. 
    
The need now is that we should make the most use of whatever opportunities 
come our way.
    
Pakistan certainly needs a lot of investments by foreigners because 
domestic investments are in adequate. There is a direct and clear 
contradiction here. If domestic investments are not being made, how can 
foreigners with excess capital make big investments here?
    
We have to first get the distortions out of the system and remove the 
deficiencies in our infrastructure. Only then can foreigners be expected to 
come and invest. Moreover, it is our duty to ensure that the foreign 
capital is put to the maximum use, as it is not something that is given as 
charity. It comes here to earn profits and it should be enabled to make 
profits. However, it should earn profits in a way that maximises its 
benefits to the domestic economy.
    
In other words, foreign investments should be made in the context of an 
intelligent investment policy as a component part of a policy package 
guiding investments without bureaucrats control or direction. A delicate 
process is indicated here. Channelising foreign investments without 
compulsion or control is not an easy task.
    
Foreigners export large or complicated machines and capital for their own 
purpose. They are not looking to our convenience or needs. 
   
They are after their own profits and convenience. It we are also looking 
for foreign investments, we should intelligently invite them and facilitate 
the process. A delicate balance has to be struck between their convenience 
and requirements and our specific needs and requirements. Can we do so?

Uncertain viability
    
Since Pakistan economys viability at the moment is not risk-free, our 
relationship with the IMF is described a roller coaster course: currently 
the IMF is unhappy with the persistent failures of the government to 
implement the policy package it has given it.
    
For three years running we have not been able to implement the 
conditionalities in the quantum and the spirit with which the IMF would 
wish us do. Our balance of payments deficit is rising uncontrollably and 
our external trade balance has increased to $ 3 billion. We have to do 
something very sharp about all these matters.
    
During the last three years what has receded from the minds of both 
newspaper readers and the government are many things of vital concern.
    
They are that our economy needs to be developed at an optimal rate. This 
development does not mean just the statistics of GDP growth. A fine figure 
can be written on the paper and we can be asked to be happy about it. The 
point about development is that maximum number of people of the country 
should get gainful employment and that benefits of development should 
actually reach the people. Their economic conditions of the people should 
be improved and prevented from deteriorating.
    
As for what is the situation, a noticeable deterioration through a very 
high inflation rate has hit a majority of the citizens. Thanks to the 
burgeoning population, unemployment levels have continued to grow, the 
number of people below the poverty line has also increased and in terms of 
real or human development Pakistans ranking has gone further down.
    
This is a state of affair that cannot be allowed to persist or some kind of 
a bust up can take place. It is time some serious thinking is done by our 
policy makers who would be well-advised not to get flustered with the 
current difficulties and ignore the major problems of the economy.

Re-think needed
    
It is time that we devise and intelligently formulate foreign economic 
policies. Emulating the Japanese example, we can set the objective of 
creating a South Asia Development fund on the model of what the Japanese 
have done vis-a-vis the two Koreas.
    
It may be recalled they have helped set up a Korean Fund. That fund is 
intended to make investments in the infrastructure primarily, the aim being 
to lift up the northern half of the divided country from its stagnation and 
help develop it along modern lines. Along the way somewhere there would be 
a Korean national unification and economic progress. And at a certain 
stage, Korea can take off on its own course.
    
The southern part of the country does not lack industrial or other economic 
resources and Japanese initiative is likely to pick up speed under the 
steam of both Japan and Korea.
    
We should be thinking along the same lines vis-a-vis South Asia, with 
appropriate changes, of course. Building a South Asian infrastructure, as a 
region, will offer a challenge to both economic superpowers: Japan and 
Germany.
    
Germany is preoccupied in Eastern Europe and Russia. Japan is close at hand 
and has been taking interest in the region. We should recruit its help.
    
The potential of this region is complete and it can become a large market, 
worthy of an economic superpower to take keen interest in. The only 
condition will be that we South Asians should get our regional act 
together. After SAPTA there is hope that this might get done, though over 
foreign friends will have to help us by educating us in the virtues of 
regional trade, co-operation, and integration.
    
We should be very careful on the subject of South Asian Fund. It has to be 
linked with SAARC and built on the thinking that has gone into it. And 
Japan should not be seen as a milk cow to obtain investments.

Commercial possibilities
    
The initiative for making investments should not be left to the individual 
exporters or big corporations of Japan only. They would do so when they see 
clear-cut commercial possibilities of making profits. In this case the need 
is different. A coherent development policy is indicated for the region: it 
has to be planning, at bottom, though of a different kind. The regions 
major infrastructural needs have to be met.
    
Let us face it, this kind of investment cannot be profit-driven in a short-
term sense, though an investment that does not yield profit cannot be 
viable or will not be sustainable. Before long it will end up in snarlers 
and the process will have to be aborted. The recipient countries will get 
trapped in foreign debts and the development will simply not take place.
    
A certain amount of indicative planning is necessary which will ensure that 
the development will follow the direction set by investments which in turn 
conform to some kind of a coherent set of objectives. That is the 
requirement. In other words a lot of work has to be done by the national 
authorities as well as the regional organisations (i.e. the SAARC and the 
various official and non-officials bodies that are associated with it).
    
It must be a coherent long item plan which should generate new economic 
activity as it goes along in a staggered fashion so that some of its 
earlier investments can begin yielding profits. That is the first 
essential.
    
The Japanese will be only too happy if the governments of the region can 
make such commitments through SAARC for a longer term investment programme. 
They have so much excess capital that it needs large markets. It should be 
our aim to become one  where the money will simply not be sunk.
    
In the interval between the investment and the commencement of its yield, 
there has to be an intensification of economic activity in the areas where 
investments have been made. It will be primarily for SAARC and national 
governments to ensure that the investments are of the kind that are viable 
economically and sustainable in terms of ecology.
    
The emphasis should not be on investments anyhow, the areas and places 
being chosen at random by a combination of accident and expediencies. All 
the major steps must be well considered and be part of a coherent scheme.

Constant information
    
Development also needs to remain constantly attuned to the real aim for 
which we are inviting Japanese investments. It reveals nothing when it is 
said that the first requirement of South Asia is that its physical 
infrastructure should be built which would require the taming of all major 
rivers for power generation and irrigation, modernise transportation 
systems, improve communications, and so forth. All these are needed, no 
doubt, but we will need much more.
    
The national authorities must, while creating conditions for foreign direct 
investments being made, must remember that the ultimate aim is sustainable 
as well as viable economic development. 
   
The purpose of the development is, as noted, not mere statistical growth in 
GDP. It must be reflected in the growth of jobs, in higher standards of 
living in ascertainable ways, and reduction in diseases and ignorance.

<a name="kse1">KSE 100 share index loses 33 points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 13: Stocks ran into deeper recession on Tuesday as investors 
took profit at the available margins ahead of the Independence Day holiday, 
pushing the index sharply lower by over 33 points.
    
Earlier in the session, it was as low as 47 points but mid-session bargain-
hunting enabled it to finish partially recovered.
    
The selling in part was also attributed to bad news from the economic 
front, notably falling value of the rupee but no boost to exports.
    
The KSB 100-share index was last quoted 33.09 points, a big loss for the 
single session at 1,452.35 as compared to 1,485.44 a day earlier, 
reflecting the weakness of the base shares.
    
The big question now being asked in the rings is that whether or not it 
will breach the barrier of 1,400 points during the current month. The 
available corporate evidence suggested that it could as there are not many 
good news on which technical rallies could feed on.

But what seemed to have triggered panic selling was the falling value of 
the rupee, which on Tuesday was quoted as low as Rs 38.60 in kerb after a 
sizeable downward lowering in official dealings.
    
The analysts said investors were in no mood to make fresh buying even at 
the attractively lower level but rather they were looking for an 
opportunity to get out of the market.

Minus signs, therefore, dominated the list.
    
PSO led the list, falling by Rs 9 to 354 on a large volume followed by 
Adamjee Insurance, which also suffered sharp setback of Rs 6.50.
    
Dewan Salman, Shell Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser, and Rafhan Maize Products 
were among the other largest losers in a single session as investors 
indulged in panic selling to get out of the market.
    
Engro Chemical, Parke-Davis, Packages, Sui Northern, KESC, ALICO and ICP 
SEMF also fell on renewed selling but the fall was modest.
 
Notable gainers were very few as there were more sellers than buyers. 
However, some of the leading shares managed to put modest gains under the 
lead of 4th, 8th, 9th and 13th ICP followed by Lease Pakistan and Quality 
Steel on stray support coming mainly from dealers holding short positions.
    
But the market decline was largely led by the trend- setters and most 
liquid scrips, notably Hub-Power and PTC vouchers, which suffered large 
unloading at the previous higher rates.
    
Owing to their greater weightage in index, they took the entire market into 
a deeper recession.
    
Trading volume rose to 21.896m shares from the previous 11.274m shares 
thanks to active dealings in the current favourites.
    
There were 297 actives, out of which 159 shares suffered decline, while 68 
rose, with 70 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="glas">Glass Towers-2</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE Glass Towers case is a classic example of the workings of a corrupt 
Third-World country, which, like a fish, rots from the head downwards. 
Greed is fed by deceit, and the lower orders, even if not corrupt, are so 
in fear of the threat of reprisals that they become cowardly accomplices to 
the misdeeds of those that flourish above them.
    
My involvement in this construction rising on the main Clifton Road started 
in April, when I wrote a column pointing out how badly it was planned, how 
illegally it was being constructed, and how the widening of the road, 
because of this single protruding building (see photograph), will not be 
possible for the next hundred years.
    
The monstrous construction had the blessings of our Chief Minister, Syed 
Abdullah Shah, guardian of our city and province, who, in disregard of the 
rules and regulations, permitted the construction of 19 floor levels 
instead of the permissible five (basement plus ground plus four). The plot 
ratio was also arbitrarily increased from 1:3 to 1:8 permitting an 
additional floor area of some 300,000 square feet. The developer himself 
has admitted that he had to pay a lot of money to get these illegal 
sanctions. In all such cases, there are many many hands stretched out to 
receive greasy gratification.
    
It took Chief Minister Abdullah Shah one week to realise his folly, he then 
made the usual Third-World noises and ordered Commissioner Zia-ul-Islam to 
investigate his (the CMs) own orders and Deputy Commissioner (South) Arif 
Illahi to stop the construction. A few days later, KDA Director-General 
Ahmed Hussain, made a statement to the Press that the building was being 
built in accordance with the approved plans, but he cleverly concealed the 
fact that what had been approved was not according to rules and 
regulations. The work was surreptitiously recommenced with no one in the 
administration willing to admit as to who it was that had actually given 
the permission to so do. The Commissioner declined to disclose his 
findings. He wrote: The enquiry report is an official document sent to the 
Chief Minister who alone is competent to make it public if it is in the 
greater public interest. The Chief Minister maintained that it was not in 
the greater or smaller public interest and did not make it public.
    
The residential plot on which Glass Towers is being built previously 
belonged to Pakistan Tobacco Company, and on it stood a building to house 
its officers. The application to commercialise the plot, and the plans for 
approval of the commercial Glass Towers, were submitted by applicants 
brief case architect Syed Taseen Ahmed and engineer Ishaq Khan wherein 
they wrongly stated the owners to be PTC. The authorities complied without 
verifying the ownership.
    
Investigations also revealed that on January 4, 1996, the Karachi Building 
Control Authority ordered the builders to stop construction as they were 
not building in conformity with the approved structural grid (part basement 
and ground floor). The notice, however, did not record the illegal covering 
of the rear compulsory open space of 15 feet. This was discovered by an 
officer of the KMC and it was demolished on January 18. The drawings 
advertised in the sales brochure, as well as the cutaway models displayed, 
did not conform to even the faulty approved plans. From the very start 
there was blatant illegality and fraud.
    
Following the total disregard for public interest shown by the Chief 
Minister and his minions, a group of angry civic-minded citizens rallied, 
joined me, and we decided to move the court. The petitioners number 
thirteen and include the NGO SHEHRI (Citizens for a better environment), 
Citizens Maher Alavi, Oscar de Freitas, Ahmed Ibrahim, Nazim Haji, Hamid 
Maker, Mohammed Futehally, Citizen-Architects Husnain Lotia, Habib Fida 
Ali, Arif Hassan, Arshad Abdullah, and Citizen-Engineer Roland de Souza. 
Needless to say, a year ago more than half of them, merely fearing fear, 
would not have agreed to lend support and their names.
    
Credit must go to Engineer Roland de Souza and to SHEHRI for all the leg-
work done and for their tenacity. Barrister Mohammed Gilbert Naim-ur-Rahman 
was instructed, and Constitutional Petition D-1280/96 was filed in the High 
Court of Sindh on August 5.
    
The grounds, inter alia, are:
    
* That the plot has been illegally commercialised, contrary to KDA Order 
and the Regulations;
    
* That the building is not being constructed to the plot ratio of 1:3 for 
commercial buildings (page 92 of Part II of the Regulations Schedule H) 
while the building in fact is being constructed to the plot ratio of 1:8;
    
* That KBCA cannot approve any building without reference to the 
availability of amenities such as water, gas, electricity, sewerage lines, 
telephone lines available in the area as it would cause additional hardship 
to the residents of the area who already suffer enough;
    
* That the building being constructed is hit by the provisions of Section 
6(1) of the SBCO;
    
* That the Chief Minister has no power to approve such buildings under 
Sections 6(5) and 6(6) of the SBCO;
    
* That the building being constructed, apart from the illegalities 
mentioned above, would prevent future expansion of the main Clifton Road as 
envisaged, as per page 90 of the Regulations Part II Schedule G;
    
* That the approved plan allowed by the KBCA and the Chief Minister is in 
any event contrary to public interest and is a mala fide exercise of power 
by the said authorities.
    
The people were fortunate. The petition came up for hearing on August 6 
before a strong Bench comprising Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed (born and bred in 
the house of his advocate father Waheeduddin Ahmed who was elevated to the 
Bench and was later to be Chief Justice of the West Pakistan High Court and 
still later was elevated to the Bench of the Supreme Court  a fearless 
judge) and Justice Hamid Ali Mirza (a former judge of the District Court of 
Sindh and later Registrar of the Sindh High Court).
    
They were pleased to grant our prayer. The petition was admitted, notices 
were ordered to be served to the various respondent government departments 
and builders. The Nazir of the SHC was appointed as commissioner, ordered 
to inspect the site and to report within ten days. The ad interim 
injunction, as prayed for, was granted until the next date of hearing. The 
construction of Glass Towers has been stayed by the court.
    
This is no time to wallow in and whinge about the current mess made by our 
leaders, encouraged by our pathetic acquiescence. This is no time to moan 
and groan like wilting violets. The time has come for anger, deep anger, 
and it is high time we exhibited that anger. Each of us, each of the 130 
million of this misused nation, must stand up, resist tyranny, and fight 
for our rights. The country was not made to be raped and pillaged. The 
country was not made for a handful of men and women to milk it dry. The man 
who made this country had other plans for it and unless we right now pull 
ourselves together, assert ourselves, and insist that things cannot go on 
as they are, it may soon be too late to retrieve what little is left.
    
The first two pillars of government, the non-functioning legislature and 
the shameless executive, have more than let us down. They have betrayed us. 
The third pillar, the judiciary, despite its trials and tribulations, has 
now asserted itself and is sustaining us.
 
Chief Justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shahs son-in-law, engineer Pervez Ali 
Shah, whose house was raided and who was suspended from service on charges 
framed by the Sindh government, has recently been reinstated. Should the 
executive not apologise to the Chief Justice for its hasty action on 
reprisal and for having framed false charges?

<a name="ames">A message all but forgotten</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.H. Askari

IF the state of the nation today were to be subjected to an honest scrutiny 
against the agenda for Pakistans development and progress set out by 
Quaid-i-Azam in his historic address to the first Constituent Assembly on 
August 11, 1947, it would be clear that there is very little of which the 
nation, and those who have been at its helm, could be proud.
    
On the contrary, over the past 49 years, the national loss in terms of time 
wasted and opportunities lost can only be seen as monumental. It is 
customary to lament that Quaid did not live long enough to provide Pakistan 
with a constitutional framework compatible with its hopes and aspirations. 
The fact is that in his address to the Constituent Assembly, he clearly 
enunciated a set of guiding principles for the building of a modern, 
progressive, democratic Pakistan. But once the Father of the Nation passed 
away, the destiny of Pakistan became hostage to the capriciousness, 
opportunism and expediency of the various governments which came to power.
    
Because of his life-long struggle to liberate the Muslims of the 
subcontinent from domination and exploitation by an immutable religious 
majority, the Quaid strongly favoured a fair deal for all sections of the 
society and believed that all citizens of Pakistan, regardless of their 
religion, caste or creed, should enjoy equal rights, privileges and 
responsibilities and said so in his address to the Constituent Assembly. 
Despite his firm faith in Islamic values and norms, he hoped that Pakistan 
would not be dominated by ordained ecclesiastics or by members of any 
divine order. Unfortunately, his address was seen as the denial of their 
opportunity by those who arrogated to themselves the authority to enforce 
an Islamic dispensation upon Pakistan. There were even attempts to suppress 
the contents of his speech at the time, but fortunately those who shared 
his liberalism and progressive view of Islam, managed not to let this 
happen. the Quaids address of August 11, 1947, which deserves to be 
regarded as his guiding directive  to the nation, has survived. It would 
seem, however, that the true message contained in it is now all but 
consigned to oblivion.
    
An official compilation of the Quaids speeches and statements which was 
originally published in 1966, altogether omitted the text of the address 
from its fourth edition when it was published in 1984 during Gen Zia-ul-
Haqs regime. There could not have been a more crude attempt at suppressing 
the ideals of the Father of the Nation. It goes to Ms Benazir Bhuttos 
credit that she had the complete text of the historic address resurrected 
and published in a collection of Quaids speeches and statements (1947-48) 
when she came to power in 1988.
    
While parts of the Quaids address dealing with the question of religion in 
the context of the business of the state - frequently interpreted as a 
secular concept - have been under constant debate and discussion, it is 
generally not realised that in the same address he also dealt at great 
length with the challenge posed by social evils such as black-marketing, 
bribery and corruption, nepotism and jobbery. He also specifically 
identified the states prime responsibility of providing security to the 
people and maintaining law and order. He spoke of bribery and corruption as 
a poison and of black-marketing as a greater crime than the biggest and 
most grievous of crimes.
    
Mr B.M. Kutty, a veteran trade unionist and political worker, speaking at a 
seminar on Quaid-i-Azams address of August 11, 1947, sponsored by the 
Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) in Karachi last Sunday, 
commented in unsparing terms of the extent to which Quaids hopes and 
aspirations have been violated by Pakistanis, particularly the ruling 
elites, in the last five decades. He said Pakistan was now described as 
the second most corrupt country in the world and hoarding, black-marketing 
and smuggling had developed into a fine art and incorporated into the 
accepted norms of trade. Likewise, nepotism and jobbery had been made an 
integral part of our national conduct.
    
Referring to the Quaids strong commitment to his ideal of not making any 
distinctions on the basis of religion, caste or creed, Mr Kutty specially 
recalled the fact that at the first session of the Pakistan Constituent 
Assembly on August 10, 1947, the Quaid had a scheduled caste Hindu, J.N. 
Mandal, elected as the president of the session. It is sad to recall that 
notwithstanding the trust reposed in him by the Quaid, Mr Mandal deserted 
Pakistan at the first opportunity.
    
Judging on the basis of his August 11, 1947, address, Quaids foremost 
concern for all citizens of Pakistan being treated as equal, irrespective 
of their class or religious denomination, was obsessive. He declared that 
in Pakistan, all citizens would be equal, with equal rights, privileges and 
responsibilities. He expressed the thought over and over again to drive the 
message home. He believed that if the ideal of all citizens being equal was 
adhered to, in course of time Hindus would cease to be Hindus and Muslims 
would cease to be Muslims, not in the religious sense, but in the political 
sense as equal citizens of the same state. The message could not have been 
clearer.
    
Looking back on how the address has been debated upon, one is surprised 
that there should have been any reason for a debate at all, unless of 
course the intention was to attribute meanings to it which were not 
intended or apparent or to interpret it in a way to suit the expediencies 
of a certain class or elite. This was also by no means the first time that 
he was propounding the thought. Once Pakistan had been conceded, he drove 
the point home again and again, while calling upon Pakistanis to build 
their country into a bulwark of Islam and spoke of the principles of Muslim 
democracy and of Islamic socialism. Groomed in the highest traditions of 
liberalism he did not speak of socialism in a dogmatic or doctrinaire 
sense. He almost lost his cool when he was asked whether Pakistan would be 
a secular or theocratic state, and told the questioner, a newspaper 
correspondent: You are asking me a question that is absurd; I do not know 
what a theocratic state means.
 
When Quaids attention was drawn to what is now sometimes called the 
hostage theory, that is, if Muslims were to be treated badly in India, 
Hindus would be treated likewise in Pakistan, he described the very idea as 
madness. The Quaid did not visualise mass migration of people from one part 
of the subcontinent to the other and since he had accepted the partition 
plan in good faith, he felt convinced that India and Pakistan would live 
not only as good neighbours but as allies. However, notwithstanding his 
strong belief that religion and politics should be kept apart, the 
Objectives Resolution was adopted by the Constituent Assembly within six 
months of his passing away. It now forms an integral part of the countrys 
constitution.
    
With his liberal thoughts and commitment to a democratic dispensation for 
Pakistan, the Quaid would have been mortified, at the very thought of what 
two military rulers of Pakistan did in the name of Islam on usurpation of 
power through military coups. Despite his Sandhurst background and 
westernised life-style, Ayub Khan found nothing incongruous about seeking a 
fatwa at the time of the presidential election in 1964, since Miss Fatima 
Jinnah was the rival candidate, declaring that a woman could not be the 
head of an Islamic state. It has to be said to Maulana Maududis credit 
that he refused to sign the fatwa. Some years later, Gen Zia-ul-Haq, in 
order to perpetuate his hold over state power which he knew lacked 
legitimacy, virtually turned Pakistan into a theocracy. Working hand-in-
glove with him were Islamic political parties which had stoutly opposed the 
creation of Pakistan.
    
The question was asked at the PIIA seminar that since the Quaid was 
committed to what would seem to be secular norms, why did he accede to a 
state being created in the name of religion? Firstly, it has been noted by 
several scholars who have researched into the evolution of the Pakistan 
movement, the most recent among them being ex-Ambassador Saad R. Khairi, 
that the Quaid invariably spoke of Pakistan as a Muslim state or as a 
homeland of Muslims. Secondly, the Quaids concern was to work towards a 
solution of the Hindu-Muslim problem and he hoped for a long time that a 
way out could be found while keeping India united. He did not endorse 
Chowdhry Rahmat Alis scheme and even Iqbal evaded specifically calling for 
a division of the country and confined himself to a plan for the 
restructuring of the provinces in order to consolidate the position of the 
Muslims.
    
For the better part of his political career, the Quaid strove for devising 
a formula to save the Muslims from losing their separate identity and from 
being exploited or dominated by the majority community. His Lucknow Pact of 
1914, his 14-point rejoinder to the Nehru report and his willingness to 
engage in talks for conciliation with Gandhiji again and again were all 
attempts in this direction. He even agreed to the Cabinet Mission plan 
which did not provide for immediate partition.
    
The aim of the Quaids life-long political crusade was for Muslims to 
escape from the domination of an immutable majority and he agreed to the 
partition plan in the last resort as a solution of the Hindu-Muslim 
problem.
    
The Quaids utterances, public or private, could leave no one in doubt that 
he was essentially a liberal, progressive-minded person and he wanted his 
Muslim compatriots to be able to live and work in accordance with the 
highest and noblest principles of Islam - equality, fraternity and justice. 
As the veteran journalist M.B. Naqvi said at the PIIA seminar, Quaid in his 
ideals went beyond what the French and American revolutionaries visualised 
for their people. How was he to know that the Muslim homeland of his dreams 
would be no more than a mirage, generating a great deal of polemics but no 
will on the part of those who would come after him to work towards the 
realisation of his ideals?

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem

OVER the 50-year period commencing in 1945, the five declared nuclear 
powers the US, the Soviet Union (now Russia), Britain, France and China, 
have carried out a total of 2,043 tests. India conducted its first and the 
only explosion on May 18, 1974. Towards the end of 1995, US spy satellites 
reported that the Indians were preparing for another explosion at the 
Pokaran site in the Rajasthan desert while Pakistan was suspected to have 
begun preparing a nuclear test site in the Chaai Hills in Balochistan.
    
Dr A.Q.Khan essentially the father of our nuclear programme had once 
(according to Nazir Kamals work published in Contemporary Southeast Asia, 
March 1992) stated that Pakistan could destroy India with five bombs while 
Pakistan could be destroyed by India with three bombs. A SIPRI publication 
has estimated Indias potential of accumulating weapons-grade nuclear 
material at around 425 kg enough to produce around 85 nuclear weapons of 5 
kg per weapon by the end of 1995. A Washington Times report based on CIA 
sources and published on December 2, 1992 estimated Pakistans ability of 
producing weapons-grade material at between 10 kg to 15 kg per annum, 
enough to produce between two to three weapons every year. If we only need 
five bombs then we have, in essence, already accumulated sufficient 
deterrence in terms of fissile material.
    
What is the logic in possessing more destructive power than one is really 
going to require? The Economist in a cover story published last year 
reported that international inspectors who searched through Iraqs nuclear 
programme found it had come within a year or so of having a bomb of its 
own. But to do so had cost it probably at least $10 billion.... India in 
its pursuit of Prithvis and Agnis has already reached the stage where half 
of its urban population now sleeps on foot-paths.
    
Nuclear testings are an awfully expensive undertaking. The five declared 
nuclear powers have thrown away a few trillion dollars by expending a total 
of 510 megatons in the more than 2,000 tests that they have conducted 
during the 50-year period between 1945 and 1995. That is the equivalent of 
producing 34,000 Hiroshima-sized bombs. An American B-29 bomber dropped 
just one such bomb on Hiroshima, incinerating 200,000 people in an instant, 
human beings were literally vaporised. Skin hung from unrecognisable 
bodies like strands of dark seaweed. Some victims lived on for a time as 
their burning bodies turned carbon black.
    
Any one of the five declared nuclear powers today has the capability of 
exterminating every single living organism from the face of this planet 
many times over (why would anyone want to kill someone more than once?). 
Why spend billions in first producing more than is required and then get 
into all sorts of arms limitation treaties and disarmament agreements?
    
Exactly 17 years after the first bomb was dropped on Hiroshima the US, 
Soviet Union, Britain and France collectively carried out a record 178 
nuclear tests (China conducted its first test in 1964). Ever since 1962, 
earnest efforts have been under way to reach a Comprehensive Test Ban 
Treaty which would ban any nuclear weapon test explosion or any other 
nuclear explosion immediately upon entry-into-force.
    
In 1963 President Kennedy announced the completion of the Limited Test Ban 
Treaty (LTBT) in Moscow and President Clinton has now declared that one of 
my Administrations highest priorities is to negotiate a CTBT to reduce the 
danger posed by nuclear weapons proliferation. In a statement released by 
the White House on August 11, 1995 the President asserted that I want to 
reaffirm our commitment to do everything possible to conclude the CTBT 
negotiations as soon as possible so that a treaty can be signed next year.
    
During the 1995 UN Conference on Disarmament there was no disagreement 
among delegates about the need for a ban on nuclear testing. On January 
22, 1996 [the] New York Times reported that the Clinton administration has 
sent its top arms control officials to foreign capitals in recent weeks to 
lobby for quick action on a treaty to end all nuclear testing. Debate to 
finalise the treaty which began on January 22, 1995 in Geneva was delayed 
by an effort led by India to link the test ban to a schedule for the 
elimination of all nuclear weapons.
    
An international disarmament conference that was held in Geneva in March 
this year was given a deadline of June 28, 96 to draft a treaty ending 
nuclear testing. That deadline has already passed and the goal now is to 
have the final draft ready and open for signing prior to the 51st General 
Assembly which is scheduled to commence on the 17th of September.
    
There is no doubt that the principal mover behind the treaty is the US, but 
no one around the world has ever successfully contested the sincerity 
behind the move. President Clinton sees himself as the deliverer of what 
Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy attempted to achieve. The entire General 
Assembly membership, it seems, is now willing and prepared to become part 
of CTBT with the only exceptions of India and Pakistan. China had raised 
minor objections to some of the on-site inspection and verification 
clauses in the treaty but an agreement between Washington and Beijing is 
believed to have been reached. China may eventually sign the treaty.
    
India wants to link CTBT with a definite timetable of nuclear disarmament 
of the five declared nuclear powers. Pakistani decision makers have, on the 
other hand, made no effort at arriving at our own strategic modus operandi 
and have instead declared that we will sign if India does.
    
India may in reality be using CTBT merely as a bargaining chip for securing 
Americas nod guaranteeing her a seat on the Security Council. India 
clearly stands to gain by maintaining an ambiguous posture for as long as 
it can withstand not just direct American pressure but a negative world 
opinion as well. Pakistan, on the contrary, has placed absolutely nothing 
on the table to barter with. Our foreign policy mavericks have themselves, 
thus, granted the leadership role to India. Well sign, only if India does; 
essentially the typical follow the leader approach.
    
Not all has been lost so far. Pakistan can still score an unprecedented 
moral victory over India by unilaterally accepting to sign the CTBT draft. 
We would lose next to nothing from such a decision and actually gain back a 
lot of what we have lost to India on the international diplomatic front. 
What must also be understood is that by agreeing to sign the treaty, with 
or without India, we will not be giving up our option to a future test 
under the supreme national interests clause that is part of the current 
draft. The supreme national interests clause if and when invoked allows a 
signatory to conduct whatever testing .... that night be required. The 
other formidable protection that safeguards our interests is the Entry-
into- Force stipulation. The entire world, including Pakistan, can go 
ahead and sign the treaty but unless all the five declared (US, Britain, 
China, France and Russia) and the three threshold nuclear states (India, 
Pakistan and Israel) put their stamps on the document CTBT shall remain 
legally unenforceable.
    
Pakistan has once again been presented a unique opportunity to leave India 
behind in the arena of international diplomacy. By our inaction and 
timidity we shall once again assign ourselves the role of an Indian 
orderly, but our activism and superior cognisance can truly propel us to 
win what we have lost many a times to our next door adversary. Pakistans 
unilateral decision to become part of CTBT, as a matter of fact, also 
fulfils our leaderships rather narrow conditionality of following Indias 
decision on the treaty. CTBT cannot become enforceable without Indias 
signature anyway.
 
Our late Prime Minister Zulfikar Bhutto had once committed to give us what 
the country really needed even if we had to eat grass. Now that our proud 
scientists have provided us the capability of deterring any hostile foreign 
designs, it is time for the impoverished citizenry of this country to share 
in the bountiful benefits that shall result from signing CTBT and embracing 
the policy of minimum deterrence. Saying yes to CTBT is, therefore, in our 
own long as well as short-term interest.

<a name="secu">Security overkill </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

IF a terrorist should succeed in creating a climate of fear, he does not 
need to explode a bomb to achieve his objective. If he should succeed in 
making public places no-go areas, turning them into fortresses, then he has 
done his job.
    
The first thing to understand about terrorism is that there is no pattern 
to it, no standard modus operandi that serves as its signature. The 
terrorist is no Zorro who leaves his mark, no Raffles who left his visiting 
card. The second thing is that there is more than one group of terrorists, 
with different agendas and there is no perceived common link between them. 
Terrorism is a hydra-headed monster. There have always been acts of 
terrorism. But why the world should suddenly be confronted with individuals 
and groups hell-bent on collective violence is something for social and 
behavioural scientists to analyse. Why is the world coming apart? What 
torments its soul? Why this criminal rage? If someone indeed planted a bomb 
on TWAs flight 800, he killed 230 people, each and every one of them un- 
known to the terrorist, total strangers to him.
    
It is understandable that after the bomb blast at Lahore Airport, efforts 
should be made to beef up the security at airports which are high-profile 
but soft targets. This is easier said than done and the stringest measures 
that have been announced and are being contemplated would have been 
tolerated by the public, the attendant inconvenience would have been 
accepted if these measures had concentrated more on a qualitative 
improvement in security, better intelligence gathering, more effective but 
low-key surveillance, by upgrading the existing technology, by getting 
better screening equipment than simply blocking out the public from the 
airports.
    
There are more than 40 commercial airports in the country and policing them 
all with the same degree of stringency is no easy matter. I do not agree at 
all that the public should be discouraged from going to airports to receive 
and see off relatives and friends. It is a part of our culture. I do not 
see the utility of searching cars and vehicles and thus creating a log-jam 
and a public nuisance at the main gates of the airports, itself a safety 
hazard. We mustnt be seen to be suddenly gung-ho about security because 
vigilance has to be permanent and not just activated because of a bomb 
blast. Law-makers and law-enforcers must understand that people will 
observe laws willingly (and not because of fear of punishment) if the laws 
are perceived to be in the best interest of society. In other words, we 
must carry the public for the best friend of security is the vigilance of 
the public, a public that is as keen to see that its life and that of its 
relatives and friends is not at the mercy of some dedicated psychopath as 
are the agencies whose job it is to make this possible.
    
Clearly, there is a case for a partnership. The measures being taken should 
be explained to the public and their co-operation sought and not demanded, 
not thrust down its throat. There should be some-give-and take, some 
dialogue and these measures should be discussed in the assemblies for the 
public that is being inconvenienced, if not harassed, is the constituency 
of the elected representatives. The assemblies must be made to play a 
greater role in protecting the rights of their constituents.
    
There is one other crucial aspect. It is not the general public alone that 
needs to be monitored but thousands are employed at the airports in 
various capacities and one presumes that they have been thoroughly vetted 
and security cleared. The more sensitive areas of the airports are 
inaccessible to the general public but not to many of these employees. One 
must not forget that the prime suspect of the Centennial Park bombing is a 
security guard though I have a feeling that the FBI is being led a wild 
goose chase but the possibility cannot be ruled out even though the motives 
of this security guard do not go beyond the hero syndrome and he may turn 
out to less than a sinister terrorist and more of a frustrated nut who 
sought glory by finding the bomb that he had himself planted. He felt that 
this might have earned him a promotion and for all we know he may well have 
written a book about it.
    
As I wrote in a previous column, the VIP lounges would appear to be the 
most vulnerable and I think a very strong case exists for simply doing away 
with them. There has been proliferation of VIPs and their tribe increases 
with each passing day. I remember many years ago a PIA Chief Executive was 
visiting London and expected that he would be using the VIP lounge. The 
London Airport authorities wanted to know whether he was a head of state or 
government. The VIP lounge, Alcock & Brown was meant only for this category 
of people. In all my travels abroad, I cannot recall that I have come 
across VIP lounges of the sort that we have. Airlines do maintain their own 
special handling lounges for important passengers.
    
I know the Commander of the ASF Brifadies Rashid Malik. Hes a level-headed 
man and one with a sunny disposition. I hope he reads this column and heeds 
some of the points that I have raised. We want our airports to be secure 
but we dont want the public to be brow-beaten and pushed around. We need 
to strike a balance with moderation being the guiding light. We must avoid 
being arbitrary for we are a democracy, even if it may not appear to be so 
some of the time.

<a name="ever">Ever changing heart of the West</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Malick

BARELY a few months back leading western diplomats, and the Americans in 
particular, would simply shrug off all suggestions of a possible comeback 
by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif. He was simply a No-No.
   
Then came the phase when the same lot started giving the man a grudging 
acknowledgement. Even more important, loud references started being made 
about the possibility.
    
The significant pro-Nawaz change of heart was also betrayed by Robin 
Raphael in her last meeting with Nawaz Sharif where an interesting exchange 
took place between her and Asfandyar Wali.
    
During the meeting at Nawazs Murree residence, Ms Raphel emphasised the 
importance of the government completing its five-year tenure as a 
guarantee of the continuity of the democratic system. At this point, 
Asfandyar Wali interjected by correcting her: I think you mean the 
assemblies completing their tenure and not necessarily the government. A 
smiling Ms Raphel nodded her head in agreement.
 
Now it seems, the American perceptions may be undergoing a third phase 
which, while accommodating a possible Nawaz replay, appears equally in 
favour of a third clean democratic alternative, to quote one very senior 
US diplomat.
   
At one time, Syed Iftikhar Gillanis name used to pop up in every such 
discussion. No more! Ever since his last scathing and articulate discourse 
in the Senate, Khalilur Rehman is fast becoming a toast of the really 
influential segment of the diplomatic corps, not to mention the corps of 
the other kind as well.
   
But who is this Commander Khalil, anyway, and what had he said in the 
Senate that had forced everyone to sit up and take notice?
    
Sen Khalilur Rehman is not prone to imparting righteous sermons to the 
unsuspecting. He throws some of Islamabads best parties, in terms of guest 
quality, and makes no effort to hide his wealth. May be because, unlike the 
majority of his colleagues, his has been earned honestly and above board. 
Literally, as the naval chief of the immensely rich Bahrain navy.
    
He has a track record of speaking his mind, and unfailingly critical, too.
   
But in his famed Senate speech he spoke like a man possessed, someone truly 
disgusted by the spreading rot in society. All Sen Khalil did was to simply 
portray things as they stood and instantly the press gallery labelled his 
speech a sizzler, and there were even suggestions that his discourse 
might have been inspired from his highly influential friends in Rawalpindi. 
As an aside, it is an interesting coincidence that the senator had told 
some friends, a good few months before the announcement about the 
appointment of the present COAS. Not that this closeness need be analysed 
in a political light.
    
Sen Khalil was not off the mark when he questioned the wisdom of preserving 
the system in its present deteriorated form without first cleansing it of 
its embedded ills. As he saw it, the system had been mutilated beyond 
recognition, and it now only helped power-hungry and lusty people to come 
into the assemblies.
 
But his most pertinent observation remained his identification of the 
biggest source of the internal rot of the present system; its own 
convoluted rationality. The system, by his logic, had started depending on 
the abusive use of a brute majority whereas it had originally been 
conceived as a source of collective wisdom. Parliament, as he poignantly 
intoned, had been reduced to the role of just electing a prime minister who 
then in turn transformed into an autocratic authority. All powerful, all 
unaccountable for.
    
Here he had a suggestion to make. If he had his way, the parliament would 
be expanded by another two to three hundred parliamentarians to allow for 
the election of honest ordinary citizens, competent professionals who he 
hoped, would swamp this present lot of blood sucking elite. Not that his 
wishing was without its own logic.
   
He also argued about the inherent difficulties of someone trying to indulge 
in horse trading of say, 600 parliamentary horses. He surely had a point 
there.
 
If an incisive analysis of Senators vitriolic address were to be made, the 
systems woes could probably be narrowed down to two main problems; the 
presence of maddening corruption in every sphere and at every level of the 
society, and the absence of even the slightest semblance of accountability 
at any level of the society. 
   
The solution, in his opinion lay in the approach of immediate surgery and 
transplant, but judging from the intensity of his expressions he must want 
a surgeon to operate with a butchers knife.
    
Regardless of what our ruling classes would like us to believe, the fact 
remains that corruption does not flow upwards but rather seeps down from 
the top. What Sen Khalil lamented was about the absolute corruption of our 
ruling elite which had corrupted the entire system, absolutely, and felt 
that already it might have been too late to save the system in its present 
form. Not that the former soldier appeared too sold on this proposal 
either.
    
He advocated the benefits of revising the Constitution in the light of our 
past political experiences. To begin with, he also felt that the present 
five-year term was too long and that we get bored by it. Though he 
stopped short of identifying either who that we were or list the desired 
amendments, but they should not be that difficult to fathom.
    
Incidentally another aside; the senator is also smitten by the Turks and 
the manner in which that nation has blended its certain realities with 
its political systems.
    
Sen Khalil says many things that are close to the ordinary mans heart, but 
in the long-term it is how certain people sitting across the Atlantic feel 
about his views that could make a real difference.

Mazdak 

SHOW me a good loser, said the cynic. And Ill show you a loser. And 
thats the bottom line in modern sports.
    
There was a marvellous cartoon in a Lahore daily the other day that showed 
a Pakistani athlete returning empty-handed from the Atlanta Olympics. A 
little boy running behind the dejected figure asks: Not even an MOU, Sir?
    
Traditionally, the only sport in which we have ever harboured any Olympic 
ambitions has been hockey, and being thrashed into sixth place this time 
was a reminder of how low we have fallen. All our hopefuls in other sports 
were duly eliminated in the early rounds. But if its any consolation, all 
South Asian countries with a combined population of over a billion people 
could only manage to grab a solitary medal between them, and that too a 
surprise bronze in tennis. And this pathetic result is no aberration: every 
four years, we are content to place our hopes for Olympic gold with our 
hockey squad; for the rest, we are resigned to our abysmal standing in 
world sports.
    
True, our squash players have done us proud over the years, as indeed have 
our cricketers and successive hockey teams. But thats about it. Our bridge 
squad showed unexpected promise for a brief period a decade or more ago, 
but has subsided to the national level of mediocrity while other regional 
teams have pushed ahead. The problem is that while the rest of the world is 
constantly setting new and higher standards, we are content to at best 
standing still; as a sop to our repeated failures at the international 
level, we recall past glories and triumphs.
    
While we have done well at cricket, hockey and squash in the past, we 
should remember that none of these games is very widely played. In truly 
global sports such as soccer, basketball, swimming, athletics and 
gymnastics, we figure nowhere in world rankings. Our national records could 
be broken by high school athletes in a number of countries. If anything, 
standards have been falling as fewer young men are willing to devote the 
kind of time and effort needed for excellence in any field. Pakistani women 
are virtually eliminated from international competition because of the 
voluminous clothing they are required to wear.
    
The usual excuse is that there are virtually no facilities or training 
available, and that millions of our youth do not get the kind of diet they 
need to perform well at the highest level. This is true, but what training 
or facilities did the shepherds from Kenya and Ethiopia have when they won 
gold medals in the marathon for so many years? Basically, we seem to lack 
the will to win that drives top athletes to the edge and beyond.
    
Even the few facilities we have built are under-utilised. For instance, the 
international-level stadium constructed in Islamabad for the South Asian 
Federation Games in 1989 is virtually deserted for most of the year. Other 
stadia, too, stand empty except for the occasional tournament. The few 
parks and playing fields that were earmarked in urban master plans have 
virtually all been transformed into hideous blocks of flats and shopping 
plazas, enriching developers, bureaucrats and politicians. Children are 
forced to play in streets; hardly any schools or colleges boast of sports 
facilities.
    
Successive governments have been oblivious to the many problems confronting 
sports at every level, preferring to stuff delegations to international 
events with their stooges who often outnumber the sportsmen. No serious or 
sustained effort has ever been made to raise standards. Even the army which 
once had an organised training programme has lost all interest in the 
promotion of sports. The result of this official apathy is that there are 
no heroes, no role models for our youth to emulate in most sports. The only 
track star we can boast of is Abdul Khaliq, the fastest man in Asia, a 
sprinter who ran way back in the fifties and sixties. Since then, it has 
been downhill all the way.
    
Ever since I can remember, our hockey players have fumbled penalty corners 
far more often than not. Now this is an area of the game that can be honed 
to near-perfection, as proved in recent years by Holland, Australia, 
Germany, and now Spain. For some reason, this simple mechanical drill has 
eluded our players. In Atlanta, this shortcoming was made painfully clear 
when team after team hammered in crisp goals from penalty corners while our 
boys seemed like clowns let into the Games to amuse the crowd.
    
The problem is that artificial surfaces have transformed the nature of 
hockey. While bumpy natural fields favoured short passing, fast and smooth 
Astroturf calls for long passes and a more physical approach to defence. It 
also produces more penalty corners which now account for more goals than 
solo or combined moves. All the few major hockey-playing nations have 
placed this surface in most of their stadia, while our young players 
continue to learn their game on natural fields; it is only when they reach 
the top that they get an opportunity to play on astroturf which calls for 
an entirely different technique. In most cases, they are unsuccessful in 
making this transition. The truth is that few organisations or educational 
institutions can afford the outlay involved in importing astroturf, so we 
can forget about ever regaining our eminence in world hockey.
    
In squash, there is no outstanding player in sight apart from Jansher Khan. 
After he retires, we can say goodbye to our traditional number one slot in 
this sport. In cricket, while Wasim Akrams team is currently doing well, 
we must remember that the present English squad is one of the weakest in 
world cricket. In bridge, ever since the incomparable Zia Mahmood decided 
to qualify for the invincible US team, our players have fared badly in 
regional and international competitions.
    
And that, alas, is it. We are amateurs in all other sports and games, and 
our standing is far below smaller and poorer countries. But while 
governments and institutions allocate the lowest possible priority to 
sport, they should remember that apart from the physical well-being sports 
provide to participants, success also promotes national unity and pride, 
intangible and unquantifiable factors perhaps, but sentiments in very short 
supply from our collective psyche.

<a name="meda">Medals are where the money is, or mostly</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS you can verify from the final medals table of the Atlanta Olympic 
Games. The US is far ahead of all others with a huge lead of 38 medals over 
the runners-up, the Russians. But had the Soviet Union been intact, the 
Americans would have been beaten back into second place.
    
Generally, the medals have gone to the First and Second Worlds, China and 
Cuba being the only exceptions among the top ten nations. I have half a 
mind to put Russia in the second World, but, believe me, despite its many 
problems, it still is a superpower. The affluent West has taken the largest 
chunk of the cake, but other regions of the world fared not too badly.
    
Take Africa, for example. It won ten gold medals, four more than in 1992. 
The most glittering of these golds was the one won by Nigeria which became 
the first African country to win an Olympic soccer tournament.
    
South Korea is emerging as a sporting power. It ended way ahead of Japan 
with 27 medals (7 gold, 15 silver and 5 bronze) to the latters 14 (3 gold, 
6 silver and 14 bronze).
    
But look at South Asia where more than a billion people live. The SAARC 
ended up with a stray bronze in tennis, won by an Indian. A bronze for a 
billion people. In hockey, for long the sub-continents only medal winner, 
Pakistan finished sixth, and India were placed eighth while such countries 
as Burundi, Croatia and Ethiopia were in the gold medal winners list.
    
Pakistan were not on the medals table, but India found itself in the 
company of nine other countries which finished at the bottom. What is the 
reason for this? Let me give you a story here. When the Chinese were hooked 
on opium, a rich addict from Shanghai went to England. The Wimbledon 
Championships were on, and his curiosity aroused about tennis, the dopey 
Chinese went to see what it was like.
    
Now, he had never seen the game before.
    
What are these two doing? he asked the man next to him.
    
They are playing.
    
What are they playing?
    
Tennis.
    
Do they enjoy playing it?
    
Very.
    
But they are sweating like pigs.
    
It is healthy to sweat.
    
But that is stupid. In our country, our servants play other games and 
sweat. We sit in the shade and enjoy ourselves. That is healthier. That is 
why we live so long.
    
But that was fifty, sixty years. Today, young Chinese take no opium and 
like to sweat it out and enjoy it. Thats why they ended up fourth at 
Atlanta. By the way, much the same sentiments were expressed by Mr Lokesh 
Sharma, managing director of a sports promotion company in India. He told 
Reuters the other day: We are a nation of spectators, not sportsmen. The 
same is true of us Pakistanis, even more so.
    
Why should this be so when most of us arent even opium- eaters? I think 
(speaking for Pakistan only) that the way we conduct ourselves in the 
political field has a lot to do with this. We are so obsessed with politics 
and politicians that we have little time for anything else.
    
Our newspapers are full of politics. In the club we talk politics; we do so 
at the dinner table, at wedding parties, even at funerals. Sunain gi phir 
kya ho, raha heh? Benazir rehti heh ya jaati heh? We seldom get to talk 
about education, health, agriculture, business or industry or the 
continuing fall in the value of the rupee. And when we talk about our 
neighbours, it is invariably about Zee TV or their horrible movies and 
never about the great strides they are taking in the field of science and 
technology.
    
Everything substantive gets lost in the political din we make. I do not 
know what was the strength of the Pakistani squad to Atlanta, but the 
number of our joyriders must have been substantial. The grants given by the 
governments, both federal and provincial, for sports promotion are misspent 
if not altogether misappropriated.
    
What to do, then? The political scene will not change for the next fifty 
years at the very least. Should we wait for our first non-hockey gold medal 
until the 2056 Olympic Games? I tell you what: if sports management is 
privatised, we could be on the Olympic medals list much sooner than that.
    
I refuse to believe that we dont have a single runner in Balochistan, the 
NWFP, the Punjab and Sindh who cannot win for us a single field and track 
medal. All we have to do is to find him. If I had the resources, I would 
set up an amateur athletic association. I will then hire talent scouts (I 
will import them if need be).
    
Once a preliminary selection has been made, I will train the athletes 
scientifically, regulate their diet and even educate them so that if they 
fall by the wayside, they can find gainful employment. I will have tracks 
of international standards at varying heights. I will make them train at 
sea level, at 1,000 feet above sea-level and at whatever heights all 
possible Olympic Games are likely to be held. No great difficulty in this. 
You know where the next Games are going to he held four years in advance.
    
I will lay emphasis on athletics because only field and track events are 
truly Olympic in spirit. Handball, judo, karate, volleyball, basket-ball, 
hockey, etc. are not. It is better to send 18 athletes and hope for three 
medals even if they are bronzes than to send an equal number of hockey 
players and come back empty-handed.
    
How will my association run? Ill take no money from the government. Ill 
accept no donations, either. Ill seek paying members at Rs 1,000 per annum 
or more if given voluntarily. Quixotic, do you think? I tell you the plan 
can succeed if I can get just ten people who are willing to give their 
time, money and effort. Come on, somebody. The idea is worth a try.

<a name="olym">Olympic medals linked with social infra-structure</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Iqbal Latif

Lack of success for India, Pakistan and most of the African countries in 
the recently concluded Atlanta Olympics cannot be simply dismissed as a 
continuation of a losing streak. It is a clear manifestation of absolute 
neglect of social infra-structure by the politicians of these countries 
that have marginalised these countries and reduced their economic and 
social rankings in the community of nations. It seems to be ironic that 
countries that have the ability to produce the most talented teams of 
cricket and have introduced their unique brand of cricket are unable to win 
a single medal but a bronze!
    
One is struck with the composition and similarity of the biggest world 
economies and countries on the top of the final medal standings. Successful 
economies have reaped the largest share of medals, whereas the worlds 
weakest economies are not amongst the top seventy-eight medal winning 
nations. Of course there are some aberrations like Ethiopia, Uganda and 
Burundi; but these are few exceptions. Success and failure in the Olympic 
games is closely linked to a countrys economic management. The poor 
performance in the Atlanta Olympics from athletes of South-Asia and Africa 
that together constitutes nearly 60% of the world population is a red flag 
for the political leadership of these countries. If medals were to be 
distributed based on population, then each nine million people would be 
eligible for a single medal. India should have won eighty-one and Pakistan 
at least twelve.
    
The lowest point reached by the South Asians depicts not only mediocrity 
but absolute mendicancy of governance. Success in Olympics for the top 
nations is achieved only as a result of the implementation of successful 
policies in educational attainment, health, material well being and the 
distribution of income. The analogy, that countries who are successful are 
countries with high human development index is reinforced by the fact that 
amongst the medal winning countries only three countries, Ethiopia, Burundi 
and Uganda won any medals which have a human development index of less than 
30. Otherwise, the other 75 countries in the top list are countries with 
the highest to medium quality of life.
    
The top five countries in the medal race, the United States, Russia, 
Germany, China and France, practice conflicting political economic systems. 
Nevertheless, one thing that distinguishes them from other nations is that 
all of them score above 60 on human development index, which is a measure 
of economic welfare of a country. The human development index that combines 
adult literacy, life expectancy, income levels and average years of 
schooling are a good indicator of economic management of a nation.
    
One can argue that success in the Olympics should not be taken as the 
yardstick of good economic management as most of the South Asians do not 
seem to enjoy track and field events or do not have extensive swimming or 
equestrian facilities like those available in the developed countries. 
Further more, due to their low per-capita income, South Asians, cannot 
indulge in such expensive tastes! Moreover, since they excel in sports they 
like, and are occasionally the world champions; so why should they care 
about winning medals?
    
This very argument can be flipped over to make the case for improving the 
facilities for populace. If these countries have the potential to produce 
world champions in strenuous sports like field hockey and squash, there is 
no reason why they cannot produce a lot of good athletes, gymnasts and 
medium to long distance runners. What they really need is national 
institute of sports excellence and a broadened encatchment pool of talent 
by universalising education.
    
Countries like Pakistan and India who are confronted with serious economic 
problems cannot be expected to throw money at sports but what is required 
is rethinking on the part of the national planners to instil a strong 
determination and killer instincts in the sporting cadre of the country. 
The planners have failed to address the need of rescuing the sinking boat 
of future generations caught up in the storm of poverty. Improvement of the 
quality of life has very little to do with the wealth of the nation. It is 
about reshuffling of the priorities and preference of bread and education 
over guns!
    
We need to look at the top 36 medal winning countries. These countries 
together represent more than 85% share in world GDP on purchasing power 
parity. One unique feature about the countries who have topped the Olympics 
medal tables is that all of them do not seem to comply with the pattern of 
the free market economy. Although majority of them are the members of the 
developed world, however, countries like China and Cuba who are fourth and 
eighth on the list are still command socialist economies.
    
Medals are not related to the ratio of population otherwise India and 
Pakistan should have reaped a rich harvest  nor are they won by 
inspiration alone. Neither does the model of economy play a decisive role 
in this regard. It is the soundness of system and vision as well as wisdom 
of the leadership that determined the degree of excellence in competition.

<a name="knig">Knight hits maiden Test 100 as match heads for draw</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Qamar Ahmad

LEEDS, Aug 11: With rain and poor light predicted on the final day, it is 
highly unlikely that a result will be achieved in the second Test and it 
will be at The Oval and not at Headingley that the fate of this three-match 
series will be finally decided.
    
Much to the disappointment of a Sunday crowd which at no time exceeded 
5,000 the fourth days play was delayed for an hour and 45 minutes.
 
England were finally all out for 501 late after tea, their highest at 
Headingley against Pakistan and when Pakistan openers walked in to take the 
strike for the second time in the match, they were offered the choice of 
playing or withdrawing as light faded.
    
Saeed Anwar and Shadab Kabir chose the second option and rightly so. 
Thirty-three overs were still left to be bowled and England led by 53 runs 
on the second innings.
    
Minutes later rain dispelled any chances of the match being resumed for the 
rest of the evening.
    
In a way it had come as a blessing in disguise. A quick wicket or two in 
conditions as they were would have made things dicey for Pakistan. Not 
necessarily Pakistan would have lost a couple of wickets yet there was the 
likelihood that it may have happened.
    
England, their batting early on, however, had given their bowlers a 
marginal advantage of a first innings lead. The remaining five wickets 
added 128 runs to their overnight 373 for five before Pakistan were able to 
bowl them out. Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmad all conceded 
over 100 runs each in hunt for their victims. And Mushtaq had bowled 55 
overs, the highest in any Test by him.
    
That they were kept in the field most of the fourth days play was due to a 
maiden Test century (113) by the Warwickshire left-hander Nick Knight who 
had resumed the day at 51.
    
Playing in his only fifth Test, he justified his inclusion with an 
impressive knock which lasted only a minute short of five hours, this being 
the second century of Englands innings, besides Alec Stewarts.
    
A broken finger in the Test against India early in the summer kept him out 
and he had to miss selection for two Tests against the former country.
    
His half century in the Lords Test against Pakistan boosted his confidence 
which was in full display at Headingley while making runs. He was the 
eighth man out. Useful partnership for the last wicket after his dismissal 
followed between Allan Mullally and Dominic Cork which yielded 30 runs and 
Mullally even hit a well-timed six off Wasim Akram.
 
But it was Cork who was the last man out when Shadab Kabir at long-leg 
scooped a spectacular catch off Wasim Akram when Cork was 26.
    
England had taken first innings lead over Pakistan when tea was taken on 
the fourth day of the second Test. In fact they also had passed their best 
(428) against Pakistan at this ground made in 1962 series.
    
Like the third day play was once again delayed and only 15 minutes were 
possible before lunch in which England added only five runs to their 
overnight 373 for 5.
    
The left-hander Nick Knight and Jack Russell, with 51 and 0 from the third 
day, were at crease even after lunch while pushing the score in singles and 
twos. The new ball taken at 402 after 122.4 overs, however, did the trick.
    
The stand for the sixth wicket was broken by Wasim Akram who made Russell 
play onto his wicket as he moved back and edged it onto his stumps.
    
It was only the second delivery with the new ball. With Knight the outgoing 
batsman had put on 37 runs.
    
Ata-ur-Rehman operating with the new ball with Wasim Akram was hit for 
three fours in one over by Knight. The impact of the blade on those short 
deliveries dented the ball so badly that the new ball was changed after 
seven overs with England on 431 and Knight on 91.
 
Knight and Chris Lewis later shared 39 runs for the seventh wicket before 
another wicket fell. Lewis, playing forward, was bowled off his left thigh 
when Mushtaq Ahmed beat his defences at 9.
    
For Knight at 96 a hundred was there for the taking which he duly reached 
with the help of 15 fours in 231 minutes batting having faced 154 balls. 
His maiden Test century in only his fifth Test was well deserved. He played 
with concentration and lot of confidence to show that he can survive at the 
top level.
    
At 113 he was caught by Mushtaq Ahmed at mid-off when Waqar Younis bowled a 
slower one and Knight mistimed. In all he batted for 259 minutes to hit 16 
fours in 176 balls he faced.
    
Seven runs later, Waqar flattened the stamps of Andrew Caddick when he had 
made 4. England led by 23 runs.
    
At tea England were 473 for 9 enjoying a marginal lead of 25 runs on the 
first innings.

<a name="sami">Sami for drastic steps to rebuild hockey side</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Walter Fernandez

KARACHI, Aug. 8: The Pakistan hockey team which finished sixth in the 1996 
Atlanta Olympic hockey competition returned home from New York in the wee 
hours of Thursday morning.

Ever since, Pakistan first entered the Olympic hockey contest in the 1948 
London Games, this years performance was the worst-ever in the countrys 
history.
    
The Pakistan team manager former Olympian flying-horse Samiullah Khan told 
`Dawn after his return from Atlanta: As I said before embarking for the 
Olympic Games that after the revolt by a number of players on the day of 
the trials to pick the Olympic squad and the subsequent 16-day break in 
training, the morale of the team had hit a low. It would be difficult to 
motivate the players to win top honours and if we finished on the victory 
podium it would be enormously satisfying.
    
What we now need to do is to make four or five immediate changes and 
elevate the lads from the junior string, if we want to make sure to retain 
the World Cup in a matter of two years time. emphasised the former 
Olympian.
    
In addition, we should utilise the Champions Trophy, the toughest hockey 
tournament in the world, an annual event, like Germany, the Netherlands and 
Australia all do by inducting fresh talent and the sole aim is 
experimenting for the two major spoils like the Olympic Games and the World 
Cup. In the Champions Trophy and other tournaments even if we wind up among 
the top four by using them as grooming competitions that should be good 
enough, said Samiullah Khan.
    
In 1948 London Games, Pakistan were able to take the fourth position. Then 
in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics, Pakistan were able to retain the same fourth 
spot, before going on to win the first-ever Olympic medal  a silver  in 
the 1956 Melbourne Games,
    
In the 1960 Rome Olympics, Pakistan earned the unique distinction of 
winning their first Olympic gold medal. But fortune took a reverse swing in 
the 1964 Tokyo Games where Pakistan managed to claim only the silver medal 
again.
    
But in the 1968 Mexico Olympics, Pakistan were able to reach the pinnacle 
once again by regaining the gold medal. Nonetheless, the see-saw continued 
in the succeeding 1972 Munich Olympics where Pakistan yet again could only 
clinch the silver medal.
    
In the 1976 Montreal Games, Pakistan slid further behind by just managing 
to take the bronze medal. In the next 1980 Moscow Olympics, Pakistan did 
not participate as it joined the West-led boycott of the Games for the then 
Soviet Union occupation of Afghanistan.
    
In the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Pakistan again were able to reach the 
height of glory by regaining the gold medal. And in the 1988 Seoul Games 
Pakistan wound up a dismal fifth in the hockey event but were able to 
salvage a bronze medal through pugilist Hussain Shah.
    
In the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games, Pakistan were able to regain a 
semblance of pride by taking the hockey bronze medal. But in 1996 at 
Atlanta, Pakistan came away without an Olympic medal since the Melbourne 
Games in 1956.
