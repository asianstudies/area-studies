<a name="8kil">8 killers of 300 persons arrested in Lahore</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, March 25: The Saddar division police have arrested eight 
youngsters who were involved in about 300 murder cases in Karachi alone.

They are professional killers and have been on the pay roll of Sipah-i-
Sahaba and the Altaf and Haqiqi factions of the MQM. The SSP said they 
had committed about 300 murders in Karachi and were involved in 13 
robberies and one murder in Lahore. 

He alleged that members of the gang had conspired to make an attempt on 
the life of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto when she was due to arrive at 
the Qadhafi Stadium for the final of the Sixth Cricket World Cup on 
March 17. Their plan was to attack the stadium with rocket launchers, 
killing a number of spectators. Besides, they had planned to attack 
with rocket launchers a number of Shia institutions.

Those arrested include the alleged head of the gang, Fahim-ul-Haq. He 
and two of his accomplices, Mohammad Asif Khan and Mohammad Asghar Ali 
were twice sentenced to death in absentia by different courts of 
Karachi. Fahim was involved in 107 cases of murder and dacoities, 
including some cases in Lahore.

ISLAMABAD, March 21: Pakistan extended full support to the rejection of 
Indian plan to hold elections in occupied Kashmir, by the All- Party 
Hurriyat Conference (APHC), and once again called upon New Delhi not to 
repeat another farcical polls and, instead, put an end to repression of 
the people in the Valley and respond to Pakistans offer for a 
meaningful dialogue on the Kashmir dispute.
 
Answering newsmens questions, the spokesman said Pakistan insisted that 
any future dialogue with India should be based on an agenda including 
the core issue of Kashmir and the non-papers exchanged between Islamabad 
and New Delhi, in order to make such talks meaningful. He said India had 
rejected Pakistans offer for holding talks on these conditions.
    
Asked whether Pakistan was aware of the outcome of the talks in New 
Delhi with four Kashmiris, claiming to represent a section of the people 
in the Valley, the spokesman said such talks were of no consequence. The 
APHC, comprising true representatives of the Kashmiris, had already 
denounced those four Kashmiris and their attempts to hold talks with New 
Delhi authorities, the spokesman added.

<a name="kash">Kashmir election could lead to more bloodshed</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Rahul Bedi

NEW DELHI: India's decision to hold parliamentary polls in violence-torn 
Jammu & Kashmir, under the "umbrella" of security forces, has been 
challenged by Kashmiri leaders and, Indian officials say, might lead to 
bloodshed.

The firefight between security forces and militants in Kashmir's holiest 
Muslim shrine, Hazratbal, which resulted in the death of at least three 
people, is a grim reminder that clashes could increase in intensity and 
frequency.

Federal Home Ministry officials feared the clash in the shrine in 
Srinagar, which houses the holy relic, a hair from the beard of Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUEI), could hamper Indian plans to hold voting in the 
state's six parliamentary seats.

And though federal home officials in New Delhi maintained May's election 
would be a step forward in restoring normalcy in Kashmir - racked by 
violence in which thousands of people have died. Kashmiri leaders said 
it would be an "exercise in futility".

But Intelligence Bureau officials said it would take just one major 
incident to nullify the entire normalisation process. And, though they 
were vigilant, they were also keeping their fingers crossed to wish 
trouble away.

<a name="defe">Defence cant be left at others mercy, says Leghari</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, March 24: President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari declared that 
Pakistan is a peace-loving country but in the face of evil designs of 
the enemy it has every right to fortify its defence capabilities.
    
He said, Pakistan does not want to enter into arms race with any 
country but at the same time it cannot leave its defence at the mercy of 
others. He said Despite facing economic constraints, the government 
attaches top priority to this national issue and is making all out 
efforts to make it impregnable, he said.
    
Mr Leghari said, The foreign hand is actively involved in exploiting 
the jobless youth into dismantling our unity. We have to fail these 
designs of our enemy and this can only be possible if we display unity 
and unanimity in our ranks.
    
This is the war, he stressed, that we have to wage now and we can only 
embrace success in this mission if the entire nation stands up to face 
this situation collectively.
    
Pakistan, he said, has commendably played its role in the promotion of 
peace in the world. Be it the struggle for independence of the 
Kashmiri, Palestinian or Bosnian Muslims, we have always kept ourselves 
prepared for extending political, moral and financial help to the 
afflicted people.
    
KASHMIR: President Leghari underlined that lasting peace in the region 
can only be ensured if Kashmir issue is fairly and justly resolved in 
accordance with the UN resolutions.    

He was of the view that The Kashmir dispute cannot be solved by 
publicising holding of so-called elections in the held Valley; nor can 
it be solved by staging a sham dialogue with self-proclaimed Kashmiri 
leaders; nor even by erecting a fence between the held Valley and Azad 
Kashmir.

<a name="govt">Govt told not to sabotage SC judgment</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, March 22: PML president Mian Nawaz Sharif has said that 
opposition parties will not allow the government to sabotage the Supreme 
Courts decision on the superior court judges appointment.
    
Talking to his party workers he said that the decision was in fact a 
step in the direction of bringing about radical changes in the political 
system and towards which he (Mr Sharif) had been indicating for the last 
couple of years.
    
As a matter of fact the Supreme Court has shortened our distance 
towards our goal of a just political system in which no government is 
allowed to frame autocratic policies, he said.
    
An independent judiciary, Mr Sharif said, was a fundamental requisite to 
make sure that democracy survived and thrived. He said it was also an 
opportunity for the government to bow down to Supreme Courts decision 
if it was sincere in making parliamentary democracy successful.

<a name="scor">SC order targets its own judges, says PM</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, March 24: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has dispelled the 
impression that the recent Supreme Court judgement on the appointment of 
judges was against her government and said, judiciary has given a 
verdict about some of its own members.
    
Talking to reporters the Prime Minister pointed out that she was unable 
to immediately comment on the Supreme Courts decision.  I can not say 
whether some of the portions of the judgement are violative of the 
constitution as some people believe.
    
Ms. Bhutto said that the government was carefully going through the 
judgment of the Supreme court and would give its formal reaction after 
having carefully studied it.
    
Answering a question, the Prime Minister said the government may file a 
review petition if found that the judgment was in violation of the 
constitution. But it is not necessary that we would certainly file this 
review petition, and let the people see its repercussions after the full 
judgement, she added.
    
She did not believe that the verdict of the apex court in any way was an 
expression of no-confidence against the government. The Prime Minister 
did not agree with a reporter that the government appointed ad hoc 
judges and said, these judges are always appointed by the judiciary. 
However, she clarified that whenever the government wanted to appoint ad 
hoc judges it sought the opinion of the courts. When we wanted to 
appoint additional judges, we consulted them and no one barred us from 
consultations with acting judges. We not only consulted the higher court 
judges but also discussed with the Supreme Court judges. Why did they 
not convey their opinion when we wanted to appoint additional judges, 
she asked.
    
Ms.Bhutto expressed her surprise over the suggestions by some people 
that the judgement will have impact on the judiciary as well as on the 
executive. It will only affect the judiciary and not the executive, she 
believed.
    
She declared that her government wanted to make the judiciary fully 
independent and said, we have tried to appoint best judges in order to 
uphold the constitution in case of any crisis in the country.
    
The appointment of judges, the Prime Minister pointed out, was the 
prerogative of the executive throughout the world and that it should not 
be seen as some thing surprising in Pakistan. Quoting the constitution 
Ms.Bhutto said it very clearly states that it would be the President who 
would appoint the judges.

Ahmad Hassan Alvi

ISLAMABAD, March 26: Chief Justice of Pakistan, Syed Sajjad Ali Shah 
said that the court was heading towards the implementation of its 
judgment against the appointment of ad hoc and additional judges in the 
superior judiciary.

Asked whether the Supreme Court had sent any proposal to the government 
in the light of its judgment, the Chief Justice said: Details about the 
correspondence cannot be provided. We are (heading) towards the 
implementation.

When his attention was drawn towards the prime ministers statement in 
which she had reportedly said that the judgment was delivered in anger 
by the honourable judges, the Chief Justice smiled and said: We are 
never angry. You can observe us (judges) now. Are we angry?

Asked to comment on the statement of PML lawyer Akram Sheikh that the 
government had planned to arrest the judges, he said: We had no 
inkling.

Syed Sajjad Ali Shah said he did not get any such impression during the 
hearing either. We had no fear of arrest.

<a name="case">Cases from SC ad hoc judges withdrawn</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, March 26: Six ad hoc judges of the Supreme Court did not 
attend their offices after the chief justice withdrew the cases from 
their courts.

The decision to withdraw these judges from different benches was 
reportedly taken at a meeting of the chief justices of the high courts 
and the Federal Shariat Court.

Court officials, however, said the chief justice had withdrawn all the 
cases from five ad hoc and one acting judge. But there was one 
exception: Justice Mukhtar Junejo, acting judge of the Supreme Court was 
allowed to work.

Those who have been reportedly relieved of their duties are acting judge 
Mir Hazar Khan Khoso and ad hoc judges Raja Afrasiab, Riaz Hussain 
Sheikh, Bashir Jehangiri, Munir Khan and Mamoon Qazi. They have been 
asked to report to their respective high courts, a court official told 
Dawn.

The court official said two permanent judges of the Supreme Court, 
Justice Abdul Hafeez Memon and Justice Irshad Hasan Khan who are acting 
chief justices of the Sindh and Lahore High Courts have reportedly been 
asked to relinquish the charge of acting chief justices and join the 
Supreme Court because of the shortage of judges.

The Supreme Court has a total strength of 16 confirmed judges. Now it is 
left with a total of 11 judges, two of whom are acting chief justices.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz sees court verdict as basis for cooperation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD, March 26: The leader of the opposition surprised the 
galleries and the Treasury benches by making an unconditional offer of 
turning the Supreme Court verdict into a basis of larger cooperation.

He said the government must not view the verdict as being anti-
government or pro-opposition but rather as being a good verdict which 
must be further channelised into producing far reaching positive 
effects.

He said: This government accuses us of being anti-democratic. I offer 
to them, lets take this verdict as a basis of starting a process of a 
larger cooperation between the government and the opposition.

While pin-drop silence prevailed among the Treasury ranks, Nawaz Sharif 
went on to state that the opposition never expected or had demanded 
the government to resign as a result of this verdict and advised the 
government against making this a matter of life and death for itself. 
He invited Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to come in the House herself 
and explain her views about the verdict rather than insulting judges at 
public functions.

He said instead of denying the presence of a serious crisis, the 
government must concede that when a whole batch of Supreme Court judges 
are sent packing then a serious crisis does exist.

He said the time for questioning the merits of the decision had passed 
and it was time for the government to submit to the courts verdict. 
Reiterating his earlier offer, he said that it was time for the 
government and the opposition to get together and talk about the 
situation.

Nawaz Sharifs unexpected offer clearly caught the ministers unguarded 
as a nervous looking law minister could be seen conferring frantically 
with other ministers for the possible formulation of an appropriate 
reply.

It was thus an uncertain looking N.D. Khan who stood up to respond from 
the Treasury side welcoming the gesture and saying that the government 
will respond to this offer.

LAHORE, March 27: Lawyers were beaten up, injured and arrested by police 
in the premises of Lahore High Court, which immediately commenced an 
inquiry into the incident by one of its senior judges.
    
Earlier a clash between rival groups of lawyers' community was averted 
when the Lahore High Court Bar Association indefinitely adjourned a 
meeting convened by it to consider two draft resolutions moved by two 
partisan groups of its members on the implementation of the Supreme 
Court order in the judges case.
    
About 15 lawyers were injured, with Advocates Aslam Zar, former LHCBA 
secretary, Khurram Wasti and Zahid Jamil Butt, who later visited the bar 
room with a bandaged head and arms, receiving serious injuries. Former 
LHCBA president Zaman Qureshi, Advocate Mushtaq Tahirkheli, political 
secretary to Nawaz Sharif, and advocates Imtiaz Kafi and Shahid Bilal 
were also hurt besides a court reporter. Several cars were also damaged.
    
Three lawyers taken into custody from within the high court premises 
were released through the intervention of LHCBA office-bearers. The 
committee has taken serious notice of the incident.
    
The PLF members strongly condemned the lathi-charge but claimed that it 
was provoked by 'outsiders'.

He said the consultations at the highest level also assessed the 
government options in this regard. The source also maintained that no 
decision has yet been taken on this issue. "The president would like to

PESHAWAR, March 21: The NWFP Assembly was prorogued sine die after the 
joint opposition walked out as a protest when the treasury benches 
stalled their efforts to suspend the rules of business to table a 
resolution regarding Social Action Board (SAB).
    
The four-member Jamaat-i-Islami parliamentary group also joined the 
oppositions boycott in its bid to press the House to unanimously adopt 
a resolution against the execution of developmental schemes under the 
federal governments social action programme (SAP).
    
Following the oppositions walkout, the speaker, was of the opinion that 
the opposition reacted due to misunderstanding as they were not given 
any consent for or against their point of view.

LONDON, March 25: The government of Pakistan has submitted to the

the involvement of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement leader in terrorist

The documents were handed over to the Foreign Office and the Home Office

The two-member team called on the foreign and the home offices to hand 
over the documents which are understood to contain audio and visual 
recordings to corroborate the documentary evidence put forward by the 
Pakistan government which for sometime has been pressing Britain to send 
MQM Chief Altaf Hussain, back to Pakistan to face prosecution on charges 
of involvement directly or indirectly in terrorist activities.

He accused the PPP and Haqiqi activists and government officials of 
forcefully occupying union offices in Landhi, Karsaz, Korangi and 
Society and kidnapping of at least 200 voters.
    
The coordination committee also demanded an end to the ongoing operation 
in the urban areas of the province. In this context, it has sought the 
indulgence of the Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court.

KARACHI, March 27: MQM chief Altaf Hussain rejected the new electoral 
list, saying that it was manipulated to defranchise the Mohajir 
community.
    
Speaking to city journalists from London over telephone, Mr Hussain 
said: "The mala fide intentions of the government is evident from the 
fact that the names of elected representatives of the MQM are not 
included in the list."
    
He called for preparing the voters list afresh and said more time be 
given for this exercise. He suggested that anyone who presented himself 
with the national identity card, his or her name should be included in 
the list.
    
Referring to the developments following the Supreme Court's order 
regarding the appointment of judges, the MQM chief said the government 
was not respecting its verdict. He said: "When the government is not 
respecting the judiciary, how can it expect of Altaf Hussain to seek 
justice from a court.
    
The MQM chief denied that he had suffered a nervous breakdown or had any 
cardiac problem as claimed by Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar. "This 
is totally wrong and aimed at creating despair among MQM supporters," 
said Mr Hussain."

seeking information about the Saudi Basharahil Group, one of the two 
pre-qualified groups willing to buy the bank.
    
He said the Bank of England is the governing bank in the United Kingdom 
where six branches of the UBL are operating. "Being a governing bank it 
is the right of the Bank of England to ask about a party willing to buy 
a bank governed by it," he added.

<a name="70pc">70pc of loans will be paid back to creditors</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aslam Sheikh

ISLAMABAD, March 25: At least 70 percent of new loans Pakistan seeks 
from the Western Consortium next month will virtually revert to its 
creditors as repayments on the outstanding debt of over dollars 21 
billion.

The nations annual debt servicing liability has now soared to over 
dollars 2 billion. Taking that into account, the net transfer of 
external resources from the Western aid club scheduled to meet in Paris 
on April 23 may not exceed dollars 700 to 800 million if new so-called 
aid pledges total dollars 2.7 to 2.8 billion for the forthcoming 
financial year.

Pakistan now repays over dollars one billion to three major creditors 
annually  US, Japan and Germany. Apart from dollars 350 million repaid 
to US, Pakistan returns approximately dollars 280 million to Japan and 
250 million to Germany every year. Repayments to the World Bank and 
Asian Development Bank also add considerable burden  approximately 
dollars 650 million half of which represents interest payment alone.

As a whole, according to official sources, debt servicing has more than 
doubled over the past one decade alone i.e. from dollars 788 million in 
1984-85 to dollars 1810 million in 1994- 95.

Over the past five or six years with the receding in the background as a 
creditor, Japan has emerged as the single largest donor to Pakistan. It 
has committed around dollars 5 billion upto last June with dollars 3.2 
already disbursed and the balance is in the pipeline.

Pakistan contracted total loans of dollars 32.5 billion till last 
financial year including dollars 10 to 11 billion which are still 
unutilised but tied to certain projects. Incidentally, external debt, 
though manageable, represents 35 percent of the Countrys GDP.

<a name="nega">Negative impact of rupee devaluation on exports</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed

DEVALUATION of the rupee continues to be the principal vehicle of the 
government in its efforts to boost the sagging exports, but it is 
proving to be too inadequate an instrument for the kind of export 
volumes we need and can achieve as that has not been followed by 
comprehensive supporting measures or a red post-devaluation therapy.
    
That is indicated by the fact the while the rupee has depreciated by 247 
percent in relation to the U.S. dollar since it was delinked from the 
dollar and brought under a managed float in 1982, the increase in 
exports in real terms has not been as large as that. Exports have risen 
from 2.958 billion dollars in 1980-81 to around $8 billion but if the 
dollar is adjusted for its real value vis-a-vis the strong currencies, 
including its 11.53 percent depreciation against Japanese yen and 12.14 
percent in 1993 and 1994 the value of the dollar has been lost by over 
50 percent.
    
So even while our exports in dollars touched the 8 billion mark last 
year from 2.958 billion dollars in 1980-81 the real export gains have 
not been commensurate with the massive depreciation of the rupee and the 
hardships it has been causing the people who have to pay incredibly high 
prices for their imported goods and POL in rupees.
    
And yet devaluation of the rupee continues to be the principal mechanism 
for boosting the exports which may not exceed $ 8.5 billion this year 
instead of the targeted increase of 14 percent. Following the steady 
devaluation strategy the rupee has been devalued four times in small 
time span since the large seven percent devaluation of the rupee on 
October 28. the last devaluation of six paisa against the dollar took 
place on March 14 and brought down the rupee to 34.52 to dollar while 
the free market rate is 36.74 to a dollar.
    
The rupee was devalued by 14.57 percent in 1993 and Mr. Moeen Qureshi as 
the caretaker Prime Minister described his part of that as a on-time 
devaluation but instead of the exports going up in 1993-94 substantially 
they went down by 2 percent.
    
And last year exports went up by 17.9 percent despite the fact that 
devaluation of the rupee in 1994 was only 2.21 percent, or for the whole 
of 1994-95 1.3 percent. And that happened as world prices of our exports 
went up particularly textiles. For the same reason our imports went up 
by 16.7 percent against a fall of 13.6 percent the year before.

Mere illusion
    
Mr. Salman Farooqi, Secretary, Ministry of Commerce talks of the rise of 
exports by $ 119 million dollars in February as the result of some 
official steps taken to boost exports, but that could as well be a 
passing phenomenon unless adequate and effective steps are taken to 
raise the exports which inched up during the first eight months of this 
financial year by only 2.20 percent against the target of 14 percent, 
while imports shot up by 18 percent against the target of 10.6 percent 
growth belying the forecast that substantial devaluation of the rupee 
and the 10 percent rise in the regulatory duty and five percent duty on 
the items untaxed then, would bring the imports down to lower than the 
targeted rise of 10.6 percent. As a result, the country was left with a 
staggering trade deficit of 2.37 billion dollars in the eight-month 
period which was double the deficit of the same period last year.
    
We now have officials, including those of the State Bank of Pakistan, 
complaining that the Federal Bureau of Statistics had under-reported 
exports by $800 million compared to the Export Promotion Bureaus and 
State Banks figures and out of that an upward revision has been only to 
the extent of 169 million dollars. Usually the State Bank figures are 
below the Ministry of Commerce or Customs figures as it takes into 
account only the money committed or earned and not merely the volume of 
physical exports or export claims which could or could not be valid. But 
for once we are facing the problem of the State Bank complaining of 
under-reporting of exports by the Federal Bureau of Statistics. The 
three agencies should be able to reconcile their figures and come to the 
correct one instead of leaving the people baffled or amused.
    
If the exports do not go up substantially this year it will be because 
the government has done through its mini-budget the same as was done at 
the time of Mr. Moeen Qureshi as caretaker Prime Minister. He followed 
his substantial devaluation with a 20 percent rise in power and gar 
charges, and increase in POL prices, apart from the rise in duty on 
Vanaspati by Rs. 3 per kilo and the Rs. 100 rise in wages which he 
announced. As a result, the cost of import and production shot up and 
eventually ended in negative growth of exports.
    
The mini-budget last October has done the same thing as well as brought 
in the regulatory duty of 10 percent on the taxed items and five percent 
on the non-taxed. All that has increased the cost of production and that 
along with the high interest rates and rise in wages is making exports 
more expensive, and so there has been a large fall in exports vis-a-vis 
the high target. The fall is even more visible in the area of textiles 
in a year when cotton production has risen to 10.5 million bales.
    
Export of silk and synthetics fell by 33 per cent in the first seven 
months of this financial year, to $209 million compared to $314 million 
in the same period last year, which itself marked a fall of 11.26 
percent from $648 million in the preceding year.
    
There has been substantial fall in the export of a variety of textiles, 
including a fall of 16 percent in garments, of nine percent in textile 
made-ups, seven percent in knit-wear and 4.81 percent in fabrics. Such 
widespread losses could not be compensated an 8.7 percent rise in 
beadwear exports and 2.48 percent rise with in towels.
    
Sharp reduction in the payment of duty drawback and extraordinary delay 
in repayment are said to be two of the reasons for poor performance by 
exporters of silk and synthetics. Other exports too have similar 
complaints. Mr. Khalid Amin, a major exporter of synthetics says that 
Pakistans clothes are considered C grade in international markets due 
to the sub-standard quality of the filament yarn provided by the local 
manufacturers.
    
Clearly the problem cannot be solved by sending larger trade delegations 
abroad, like the 70-member delegation which went to Australia recently 
or the larger one which went to South Korea earlier, or the by the 
businessmen who go with the Prime Minister on her foreign trips. Nor can 
much be gained by hastily arranged trade fairs or participation in 
foreign trade fairs in the light of the poor quality of our exports or 
the very low-value added in a world which is becoming increasingly 
quality conscious. Raising the quality and value of our products has to 
become a national pre-occupation and the government and the private 
sector have to come up with the requisite training institutions for 
that.
    
Meanwhile, the country is being treated to a number of contradictory 
news items in respect of exports. It was earlier reported that the 
Export Promotion Bureau proposed giving 50 percent freight charges for 
exports by air to Central Asia but now it is reported to have dropped 
the idea. It has also been reported the freight subsidy given for export 
of fruits and vegetables with gulf has resulted in a fall in their 
exports.
    
And while the Prime Minister and others have been advertising Pakistan 
as the gateway to Central Asia an announcement by the Central Board of 
Revenue says the government has amended the Open Bonded Manufacturing 
Rules, 1989, and restricted export of goods manufactured under these 
rules to any country by the land route.
    
And while our export of fish has been falling even when it has been 
small the Karachi Fish Harbour is reported to have become a foul 
smelling garbage island again while the newly built fish harbour at 
Korangi is not being used because of the violence in the area.
    
Against such a backdrop exports cannot rise substantially, or the value-
added content of the exports soar, nor the steady devaluation of the 
rupee which pushes up prices of imports give us the kind of better deal 
we expect.

<a name="polp">POL pipeline: a big private sector initiative</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Muhammad Aslam

PAKISTANS annual consumption of petroleum products is expected to grow 
to 29 million tonnes, worth $3 billion before the turn of the century 
and the big question facing economic managers is how to create basic 
infrastructure facilities to transport this huge quantity from the port 
areas to the distribution outlets throughout the country. The Shell 
Pakistan-led consortium, which offers to build 800-km pipeline costing 
$600 million seems to have come at a right time and saved the government 
from an impending crisis.
    
There could be more than one options before the government, keeping in 
view the economies of scale but it must opt for the cheapest, safest, 
swifter and technically perfect modes of transportation of POL products.
    
Pakistan will need 1,600 22-tonner oil tankers daily to feed on all the 
thermal power units for which Memorandum of understanding (MOUS) have 
already been signed, a survey conducted by some of the leading oil 
distribution companies reveals.
    
Nobody will disagree that the existing supply and logistic system has 
almost become obsolete as the oil haulers, keeping in view the growing 
demand, might not be able to match the demands of the unfolding 
distribution scenario.
    
But will our existing road transport system or the roads prove capable 
of handling that massive workload in the coming year? road transport 
experts ask, adding, The answer well be a plain No.
    
According to figures available from the major oil marketing companies 
oil is currently transported to the interior of the country by road 
through well over 15,000 tankers owned by 1,200 contractors.
    
A recent seminar held in Karachi by Shell (Pakistan) to have an overview 
of Pakistans oil industry has highlighted many problems facing the 
industry and offered workable solutions. The main emphasis was, however, 
on the transportation and distribution network for obvious reasons.  
Pakistan is not an oil producer like Saudi Arabia or Kuwait but there 
is oil though not much and search for it must continue, T.V. Higgins, 
managing director of Shell (Pakistan) told to the participants of the 
seminar.
    
However, hunt for oil is on and big oil find in the Badin belt has 
raised hopes that massive investment being made by the foreign investors 
could prove more productive.
    
Higgins observations points to the fact that Pakistans efforts to 
attain self-sufficiency in oil production might still be far away and it
will remain at the receiving end for some decades to come and needs to 
streamline its transportation system.
    
Pakistans average oil production is about 2,000 bpd (barrels per day as 
against Saudi Arabias 30,000 bpd but it abounds in gas reserves which a 
equally precious, Higgins says. The developing oil scenario, therefore, 
highlights the need and importance of transporting POL products through 
a network of pipelines connected with the main line as is being done in 
the major producing countries of the world.
    
The system, considered to be most efficient and economical has long been 
in operation if the previous governments have in mind the importance of 
this vital sector. The present government probably could not alone raise 
funds for this gigantic pipeline project as it was engaged with some 
other priorities project, but has encouraged the private sector to take 
up the project.
    
Shell (Pakistans) initiative to build an 800-KM pipeline linking port 
area storage facilities with the distribution network of the country, 
therefore, came at the right time and was widely acclaimed by both the 
government and the private sector against the backdrop of vital national 
interests. The idea to have a pipeline was there long ago but no one was 
ready to bell the cat.
    
Three cheers for Higgins for at last having expedited installation of a 
$600 million pipeline as he has not only played a sponsoring role but 
also managed to set up a consortium of eight major distribution 
companies, each one of which will have a stake in the pipeline project. 
The government needs to provide all back-up facilities to this great 
private initiative.
    
The oil pipeline, which will be ready by 2000, will supply oil to the 
mid-country refinery at Mehmoodkot, near Multan, having an annual 
processing capacity of 4.25 million tonnes for onward distribution of 
POL products to Central Punjab and up north. It will meet 30 percent of 
the POL demand of these areas.
    
The eight consortium members will have in the new company an equity 
share in the following ratio: Shell (Pakistan) 25 percent, Pak-Arab 
Refinery, 20 percent, Eid Company of Saudi Arabia, 15 percent, PSO 10 
percent, AMEC Utilities of UK 10 percent IFC 10 percent Army Welfare 
Trust 5 percent, and Caltex 5 percent.
    
The news of Pakistans national petroleum products pipelines was 
promptly pithed up by India, which on March 15, announced the formation 
of an identical company in the public sector to build Rs 35 billion POL 
products pipeline network. Indias POL product demand is expected to 
jewel to 100 million tonnes during the next three year but it has the 
same transportation problem, as Pakistan does.

<a name="site">SITE budget proposals 'Huge borrowings from banks upset economy'</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 27: Huge borrowings from the banks by the government 
during the last five years have upset the economy due to which the 
government's contention to achieve projected growth rate of 6.5 percent 
in 1995-96 seems quite optimistic.
    
The government in 1995-96 had decided to borrow Rs 28.1 billion for 
budgetary support but by the end of January 1996 it had already borrowed 
Rs 59.5 billion against 1994-95 where budgetary borrowing had stood at 
Rs 27 billion, less than Rs 19 billion in 1993-94, wherein the target 
was fixed at Rs 15 billion.
    
The above situation shows high rate of government's borrowings and in 
1994-95 the growth rate was 4.7 percent as against the target of 6.9 per 
cent.
    
In order to achieve the targeted growth, the SITE Association of 
Industry has proposed to the government to control non-development 
expenditures.
    
In a package of 1996-97 budget proposals to the government, the SITE 
Association suggested to the government to further reduce the mark-up 
rate by four percent in order to boost industrialisation because the 
present rate of 19 percent was too high compared to India, China and 
Taiwan.
    
The Association proposed that rate of interest for loan and advances to 
industry should be fixed at 10 percent while import licence fee of six 
percent on import of machinery and spare parts should also be withdrawn.
    
Regarding fix sales tax system, the Association urged the government to 
continue the system for another five years because it had proved 
lucrative for the government as far as the government revenue earnings 
were concerned.
    
To minimise the burden of tax on industry, the government should impose 
tax on income of land barons. Wealth tax on agriculture be fixed for per 
produce unit at least Rs 500 compared to present Rs 200, the Association 
proposed.

<a name="fall">Fall across broad front witnessed</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Aslam

STOCKS fell across a broad front during the preceding week as investors 
were not inclined to take new positions at the falling prices but there 
were no apparent reasons for the renewed sell-off.
   
There is certainly a major shift in the investment climate owing to a 
combination of negative factors including a loud whispering on new taxes 
on the share business.

As widely feared the KSE 100-share price index broke the psychological 
barrier of 1,600 points and was last quoted at as compared to 1,638.26 a 
week earlier.
   
Most of the MNCs in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors showed 
divergent movements amid active bouts of buying and selling. Lever 
Brothers followed them.
  
Bulk of the support was, however remained confined to BOC Pakistan, 
Engro Chemicals, Dawood Hercules, ICI Pakistan Highnoon Lab and Hoechst 
Pakistan, closing mixed.
   
The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, Hub-Power, lucky 
Cement, ICI Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser, LTV Modaraba and Dhan Fibre.
   
Trading volume fell to 135 million shares from the last weeks 159 
million shares. Bulk of the alternate bouts of buying and selling, 
however, remained confined to PTC vouchers.
   
Hub-Power was the second most active scrip, which accounted for about 35 
million shares, finishing modestly lower. Fauji Fertiliser was also 
actively traded.
   
Trading was largely selective as bargain hunters and foreign buyers were 
not inclined to move out of the safe havens and the current active, 
leaving all other sectors modestly traded.
   
Lucky Cement, ICI Pakistan and some other current favourites were also 
traded actively but mostly on the lower side, reflecting liquidation 
from weakholders.

<a name="mass">Massive activity in PTC vouchers, Hub-Power</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, March 26: Massive activity in PTC vouchers and Hub-Power pushed 
the turnover figure on the Karachi Stock Exchange to a record 74 million 
shares.

PTC vouchers accounted for 38 million shares, surpassing their previous 
single-session record of 30 million shares, Hub-Power was traded for 28 
million shares.

The market opened substantially higher despite heavy battering of the 
last two sessions as until noon the index was higher by well over 20 
points but late selling again pushed the market back in the minus 
territory.

After initial rise, the KSE 100-share price index finally ended lower by 
5.85 points at 1,482.84 as compared to 1,488.69 a day earlier, 
reflecting the weakness of the base shares.

Minus signs again dominated the list, most of the MNCs remained under 
pressure on renewed selling and rolling of positions to some low-priced 
issues on other counters.

Shell Pakistan was leading among them falling by another Rs 7 apparently 
on post-dividend profit-taking. PSO followed it falling by Rs 4.

Others were led by Philips, Al-Ghazi Tractors, BOC Pakistan, Siemens 
Pakistan, Hoechst Pakistan, Reckitt and Colman, Bata Pakistan, Engro 
Chemicals and Fauji Fertiliser, falling by one rupee to Rs 2.

Among the local leading shares, which suffered modest decline, Century 
Insurance, Dadabhoy Insurance, Jubilee Spinning, Cherat Cement and 
D.G.Khan Cement were leading.

Some of the ICP mutual funds came in for active short-covering at the 
lower levels and ended partially recovered under the lead of Third and 
4th ICP, 6th, 13th and 15th ICPs, and blue chips such as Crescent Bank, 
Adamjee Insurance, and Telecard, rising by one rupee to Rs 10.

Askari Insurance, Metro Life Insurance, Faran Sugar, Fecto Cement, Sui 
Northern and Indus Motors were among the other prominent gainers.

The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, lower 15 paisa on 
37.760m shares followed by Hub-Power, easy 50 paisa on 27.856m shares, 
Fauji Fertiliser after the news of over subscription of its new issue of 
new plant at Port Qasim, lower one rupee on 2.078m shares, Lucky Cement, 
up 45 paisa on 11.654m shares, ICI Pakistan, higher 35 paisa on 1m 
shares, LTV Modaraba, steady 15 paisa on 0.247m shares, MCB, up 75 paisa 
on 0.141m shares, and Faysal Bank, off 25 paisa on 0.101m shares. 

Trading volume soared to 73.811m shares from the previous 50.484m shares 
thanks to heavy dealings in PTC and Hub-Power. There were 291 actives, 
out of which 146 shares suffered fractional decline, while 86 rose, with 
59 holding on to the last levels.

Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, March 27: The KSE 100-share index recovered 45.77 points at 
1,528.61 as compared to 1,482.84 a day earlier, reflecting the strength 
of the base shares.
    
Bulk of the support was, however, remained confined to PTC vouchers and 
Hub-Power. While the former was traded higher by Rs 1.45 on 29 million 
shares, the latter also gained as much on 24 million shares.
    
Most of the leading scrips recovered smartly under the lead of PSO, 
Brooke Bond and Parke-Davis, which showed gains ranging from Rs 5 to 12, 
biggest being in the last one. They were followed by blue chips such as 
ICP SEMF, Adamjee Insurance, Dewan Salman, Datacom, BOC Pakistan, Dawood 
Hercules, Engro Chemicals, Fauji Fertiliser and Lever, which showed 
gains ranging from Rs 2 to 5.
    
Bank, cement and energy shares led the marked advance, rising sharply on 
active short-covering at the lower levels, finishing higher under the 
lead of Askari Bank, Faysal Bank, MCB, and Bank Of Punjab. Maple Leaf 
Cement, D.G.Khan Cement, Pakistan Slag Cement, and Cherat Cement were 
leading and so were EFU and Adamjee in insurance sector.
    
Barring sharp decline in Dadabhoy insurance, and Orix Leasing on stray 
selling, which fell by Rs 2 to 8.50 and so did Shell and Cyanamid 
Pakistan, losses elsewhere were modest. Hoechst Pakistan, Knoll, 
Telecard, Pakistan Oil fields and some other leading shares also fell 
fractionally.
    
The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, higher Rs 1.45 on 
28.637m shares followed by Hub-Power, also up Rs 1.45 on 24.340m shares, 
Fauji Fertiliser, up Rs 3.40 on 2.265m shares, Lucky Cement, firm 45 
paisa on 1.233m shares, ICI Pakistan, up one rupee on 0.948m shares, 
Maple Leaf Cement, steady 75 paisa on 0.324m shares, Dhan Fibre, higher 
90 paisa on 0.235m shares, and LTV Modaraba, firm 30 paisa on 0.280m 
shares. There were several other notable deals also.
    
Trading volume fell to 62.650 m shares from the previous 74m shares.    
There were 333 actives out of which 178 shares rose sharply, while 103,

 Firstly to Petitioner Rais-ul-Mujahadeen Habib-ul-Wahab-ul- Khairi, an 
unpurchasable commodity, an advocate of integrity, a man who goes to war 
fired by his convictions, fighting against the unjust, the squanderers 
of the nations wealth, the abusers of power. Credit to him also for his 
persistence. And to his able assistant, Saleem Sheikh.
    
Khairi, like many of us, was convinced that there was something very 
drastically wrong with the way in which the judges of our superior 
courts were being appointed, transferred, harassed, in short, 
manipulated to suit the governments ends and to the disadvantage of the 
people, he filed his constitutional petition in the Supreme Court, and 
he pleaded his own case.
    
 To the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sajjad Ali shah, and to the judges 
who sat on the Supreme Court Bench to hear Khairis petition, Justices 
Ajmal Mian, Fazal Ilahi, Manzoor Hussain Sial and Mir Hazar Khan Khoso. 
The first three have been distinguished Chief Justices (Sindh and 
Peshawar) in whom the people have great confidence, the fourth was a 
respected judge of the Lahore High Court, and the fifth was a judge of 
the Balochistan High Court who was merely an ad hoc judge of the Supreme 
Court. Realising the importance of the subject of the petition, they 
admitted it for hearing, they heard the case with great patience over a 
period of just under five months (from November 5, 1995, to March 13, 
1996) and at the end, on March 20, delivered what truly is a landmark 
judgment, truly historical, as balanced and comprehensive as was 
possible to hand down under the prevailing circumstances.
    
 To the senior-most amicus curiae, former law minister and attorney 
general, Jadoogar of Jeddah Sharifuddin Pirzada, for the hard work put 
in, for his mastery of case law, for his provision of fresh source 
material, for his lucid arguments, and for his expert, wise and 
comprehensive guidance of the court. The day he closed his arguments 
marked his 50th anniversary at the Bar.
    
 To Akram Shaikh, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, who 
lent his substantial weight to the cause, who explained most explicitly 
the wonky conception of the government lawyers interpretation of the 
word consultation and of their understanding of practice at the Bar 
(that merely enrolment is a sufficient qualification without actual 
practice or standing.
    
 To the Lahore High Court Bar Association for deputing Professor Riazul 
Hasan Gilani to expound so well on Islamic jurisprudence in relation to 
the points raised by Khairi, with particular reference to the limited 
functions to be performed by Acting Chief Justices.
    
 To Chief Justice Ahmadi, of the Supreme Court of India, for his 
unambiguous pronouncement: He stated that the judiciary does not seek an 
expanding role but that it has had to extend its jurisdiction by, at 
times, issuing novel directions to the executive, something it would 
never have resorted to had the other two democratic institutions 
functioned in an effective manner. Judicial activism thus assumes a 
democratic purpose.
    
On the debit side:
    
 The Government of Pakistan which so loudly, in shrill and full voice, 
flaunts its commitment to the independence of the judiciary and trumpets 
its high regard for that institution. It has had printed news items, 
interviews, and columns galore, written by people of little credibility 
or worth. It thrives on wrong, on riding roughshod over all and sundry, 
and on getting its way regardless of the means. Its sole aim is to 
remain in power, for term after term, and wield it unscrupulously. Why 
were additional judges of the High Courts of Sindh and Lahore confirmed 
or made permanent in such indecent haste, in the hours of darkness, the 
night before the judgment was to be announced? Where was the emergency 
or urgency?
    
 We admire the judges for their fortitude in withstanding the pressure 
that was brought to bear on them. Amicus Pirzada is being dealt his 
share of harassment. Petitioner Khairi also came in for rough treatment. 
Possessed of little material wealth, he did not have much to lose but 
even so his car was damaged and his person threatened.
    
 The Attorney General: Qazi Jameel is an amiable man, who 
constitutionally holds office during the pleasure of the President (in 
effect, the Prime Minister). It is his bounded duty to give advice to 
the government only on such matters as may be referred or assigned to 
him, and also to assist the court independently. He has been heard to 
say, when the government does something particularly nasty, that his 
advice was not sought and therefore he was helpless in the matter.
    
 Veteran Yahya Bakhtiar: He followed the brief given to him, expounded 
at length, but his heart did not seem to be in line with his head. He 
did his best to uphold his clients conceptions, but was unsuccessful.
    
 Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan: I no longer use the prefix Cambridge in 
deference to that university and to the muted protests of two of my 
senior counsel, Cambridge men Khalid Anwer (St Johns) and Makhdoom Ali 
Khan (Corpus Christi). As bidden by his client, he was hell-bent on 
upholding the cause of politicising the judiciary for the governments 
self- preservation, and to the peoples detriment.
    
To the courtroom on Sunday, March 17: Justice Khosos chair was removed 
from the Bench and the Chief Justice announced that the brother judge 
was not able to be in court for reasons beyond his control. On March 
20 he was still absent when the short order was announced, which, by the 
time this is printed, will have been reproduced in the Press.
    
Significantly, our High Courts will now not be burdened by permanently 
Acting Chief Justices, the very nature of whose designations makes 
them feel insecure. An independent judge can no longer be punished and 
exiled to the Andamans (Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court Nasir 
Aslam Zahid will now return from the Shariat bench).
    
The constitutional meaning of the word consultation has been well 
defined. An acting CJ cannot be a consultee. No man considered unfit and 
unsuitable by the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the Chief Justice of the 
High Court concerned can be appointed as a judge. Safeguards against 
political considerations have been built in and one now remains assured 
that ad hocism has been buried for good.
    
Reactions:
    
>From Abida Hussain (better known as Chandi), the sprightly opposition 
leader: We are jubilant, but the people fear that the government will 
not honour the Supreme Court order. Nothing surprising about that, I 
responded. No democratic freely and fairly elected government of 
Pakistan can live with a strong judiciary. The government, ill-advised 
as it is, will pull every trick in the book to delay or frustrate the 
implementation. Get your train-marchers off the train and onto the 
barricades to build up public opinion and counter all unscrupulous 
moves.
    
>From Dera Bugti came news from the Nawabs intelligence chief, Wadera 
Ghulam Haider, his Edgar Hoover, that the government is conspiring to 
kill his tribal chieftain in a staged encounter, and that the besieged 
Nawab Mohammed Akbar Shahbaz Khan, Tumandar Bugti, wanted a word with 
me. He came on the line. I asked who exactly it was that was after his 
blood. Forget that, said the ageing tiger, that I can handle. But I have 
just heard that a very fair order has been declared by the Supreme 
Court. Can you fax me a copy? Of course, I said, now that the supremacy 
of the law finally concerns you.
    
>From Delhi, my lawyer friend rang also asking for a copy to be faxed to 
him, as he could make good use of it.
    
>From my counsel, Barrister Khalid Anwer: Its a great day in the annals 
of our judiciary, one which opens a new dawn of judicial independence, 
and opens the portals of political activity without fear of effective 
victimisation.
    
>From senior advocate of the Supreme Court, friend Ijaz Batalvi, defender 
of the underdog and liberator of the boisterous Sheikh Rashid: I have 
read the order. Its very good judgment. Please congratulate the 
Jadoogar on my behalf and remind him that this is just the beginning. 
Our problems will not end here. The Lahore Bar has emphasised that it 
will support the judiciary to the hilt.
    
Today is March 21, the spring equinox. Bahar aamad, gul-e-surkho, hazar 
aamad....

<a name="thef">The fruits of arrogance : Islamabad diary</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

THERE is a strange malady which afflicts Pakistani rulers sooner or 
later. Just when everything seems to be going fine for them they must do 
something completely queer to tempt the fury of the gods.
    
It is not too long ago that Mian Nawaz Sharif, while enjoying a two-
thirds majority in the National Assembly, forfeited his prime 
ministership when he entered into a wholly avoidable conflict with the 
then President, Ghulam Ishaq Khan. If Nawaz Sharifs impetuosity had 
been the result of considered policy, something might still have been 
said for it. But all the evidence suggests that he and his advisers 
stumbled into a confrontation whose consequences they probably lacked 
the imagination to foresee. Nor was the doughty president much better 
advised. In the twilight of his career he lived up to what Shakespeare 
says in As You Like It that in the last stage of his life a man 
returns to the helplessness of childhood.
    
The same malady has now struck the present rulers. Just when their 
government looked secure, with the Muslim League trying to figure out a 
strategy for itself and the MQM on the run in Karachi, they had to 
manufacture a crisis with the superior judiciary.
    
Packing the high courts of Punjab and Sindh with appointees whose 
political affiliations shone brighter than their legal ability was bad 
enough. But what prompted the authorities to give a personal spin to a 
judicial problem? When the petition filed by Rawalpindis maverick 
lawyer, Mr Wahabul Khairi, questioning the manner in which the PPP 
government had appointed high court judges was accepted for regular 
hearing by the Chief Justice, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, the government 
was incensed. Here was a chief justice who had been elevated over the 
heads of several colleagues senior to him. What is more, by his 
appointment a precedent observed since the days of Justice Munir had 
been broken. And yet this same chief justice was now exercising his mind 
and acting in an independent manner. The inference was clear. The 
government and its law officers expected the Chief Justice of Pakistan 
to behave like an SHO and when, to the governments amazement but to  
the delight of most Pakistanis interested in the supremacy of the 
judiciary, he did not, the government was angry.
    
The governments two-pronged response was worthy of any neighbourhood 
tough. First, a lawyer whose ties to the ruling party were no secret 
filed a petition in the Peshawar High Court challenging the appointment 
of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of Pakistan on the grounds 
that he was not the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court. This 
petition has still to be decided. Secondly, the Sindh government, which 
in Pakistan today presents the most shining example that there is of 
provincial autonomy, put the heat on Justice Sajjad Ali Shahs son-in-
law, an employee of the provincial government. His house in Hyderabad 
was raided by the police and he was suspended from service. So much for 
political tact and propriety.
    
The logic which led to this action can easily be reconstructed. In the 
eyes of the government, Justice Sajjad Ali Shahs fault was not that he 
was perceived as an adversary. Adversaries who cannot be bent and harsh 
realities that cannot be changed the Prime Minister has learnt to 
suffer, this being a hallmark of her hard-won pragmatism. Justice Sajjad 
Ali Shah, however, was behaving independently when instead he should 
have been showing his gratitude. Her government, therefore, tried to 
behave with the Chief Justice of Pakistan exactly as it would have dealt 
with one of its difficult minions: by sending the police after his son-
in-law which is a page out of the book of standard Pakistani criminology 
where, if a chief suspect cannot be hauled up, his next of kin is.
    
While engaged in these tricks the government seemed to forget that it 
had an important law case on its hands which if lost could lead to a 
serious crisis. At first the Attorney-General, Qazi Jamil (who, apart 
from any other sin, is being blamed for poisoning the Prime Ministers 
ears and leading her down a destructive path) procrastinated, not 
appearing before the Supreme Court on one pretext or another. When he 
finally was left with no option but to open the government case, it 
became painfully obvious that the Chief Law Officer of the land was ill- 
prepared for what can safely be considered as the most important case of 
his life.
    
But all this is water under the bridge. The important thing is that in 
the Judges case the Supreme Court has spoken and in doing so has 
administered a stinging reprimand (to put it no stronger than that) to a 
government that was getting to be too sure of itself. In putting the 
stamp of its interpretation on Articles 177 and 193 of the Constitution 
 articles which relate to the appointment of judges to the Supreme 
Court and the High Courtsthe Supreme Court has altered the relationship 
between the Executive and the Judiciary by making it well impossible for 
the President to appoint judges to the superior courts in opposition to 
the wishes of the concerned chief justices. 
   
Furthermore, the powers hitherto exercised, and frequently misused, by 
the executive authority to harass if not chastise members of the 
superior judiciary, and also to breed a sense of insecurity in them, 
have either been done away with completely or sharply curtailed. Thus 
the practice of appointing acting chief justices has been circumscribed 
by the condition that within 30 days a vacancy must be filled. No ad hoc 
judges can be appointed against permanent vacancies in the Supreme 
Court. A high court judge can be transferred to another high court in 
the public interest but not as a punishment (which presumably means that 
a transfer will be subject to the consent of the chief justice concerned 
or the judge in question).
    
In deciding this the Supreme Court has declared that Article 209 of the 
Constitution, which guarantees security of tenure being part of the 
original 1973 Constitution, has precedence over Article 203-C which is a 
legacy of military rule.
    
As has been commented upon widely, if this argument is accepted (as it 
has to be since it is the highest court which is making it), the door is 
flung open for striking down the other additions to the Constitution 
made by General Zia-ul-Haq and later provided blanket cover by 
Parliament through the passage of the Eighth Amendment. Conceivably, 
this could re-open a host of constitutional issues hitherto considered 
settled. The question, however, can legitimately be asked whether 
overriding a constitutional provision is a legitimate exercise of 
judicial interpretation or an encroachment into the field of law making 
which lies outside the competence of the Supreme Court.
    
Of more immediate relevance to the government is the fate of its 
judicial appointees who have come under a cloud because of this 
judgment. Unless confirmed/regularised by permanent chief justices, 
their appointments are void in terms of the Supreme Courts ruling. 
Already the Karachi and Lahore bar associations, displaying an 
enthusiasm which accords ill with the restraint usually associated with 
the legal profession, have raised the banners of revolt against these 
unfortunate souls. None of this can please the government which is still 
trying to shape its response to a judgment which has been no less than a 
judicial bombshell for it.
    
The critical question, therefore, is whether the rulers will have the 
sense to moderate their reactions and make the best of a verdict 
delivered by someone who has turned out to be their Becket or whether 
they will make life difficult for themselves by locking horns with the 
judiciary and giving the legal profession, which at least in this 
country is no more level-headed than any other, a pretext to raise a 
nation-wide rumpus? Another consideration could also be kept in mind. 
For a polity still trying to find the golden mean, judicial intemperance 
can be as unwholesome in its effects as executive excesses. If 
governments, and this government especially, have been appointing 
political favourites to judicial offices, the high priests of the 
judiciary must doubly guard against the temptation of judicial 
favouritism.
    
In any case, for the smooth functioning of the affairs of the federation 
a civilised working relationship has to exist between the executive and 
judicial branches. If it does not, what is supposed to be a system of 
checks and balances can easily degenerate into mindless obstructionism. 
In such an eventuality the public interest suffers. At this juncture, 
therefore, it is not just the rulers and their law minions on trial but 
also the superior lights of the judiciary.

<a name="dowe">Do we know what the rule of law means?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

WE are a nation of lawyers with more lawyers per square kilometre than 
doctors and engineers. Yet, for all the respect that we have for the law 
and its processes, we ought as well be living in the pre-legal ages. 
Consider in this respect the multifarious responses to the Supreme Court 
verdict in the Judges Case. Everyone, from the Prime Minister downwards, 
is commenting upon it. The Prime Minister has said in So many words that 
by this verdict the-judiciary had created, problems for itself. The 
opposition is rubbing salt into the government's discomfiture by 
impressing upon it the necessity of accepting the verdict. Mian Nawaz 
Sharif has urged the President to save the dignity of the Supreme Court 
by seeing to it that its judgment is implemented. From some quarters has 
come the sensational disclosure that on the eve of the judgment there 
were cries in the government toying with the idea of putting the judges 
of the Supreme Court under arrest. On Monday excitement gripped newsmen 
in Islamabad when they were informed that the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court was about to have a Press conference. In the event he did 
not which is no small cause for mercy. Meanwhile, bar associations 
across the country have been issuing resolutions: some in support of the 
verdict, others against it.

These are not happy developments. The Supreme Court is the highest court 
in the land. Whether someone likes it or not, it has the last word in 
judicial and constitutional matters. Since it is not an infallible 
institution, it is quite possible for reservations to be expressed about 
its judgements. The history of Pakistan is littered with judicial 
verdicts, especially on constitutional matters, which have been 
considered controversial. Yet, for better or worse, there is no 
alternative to accepting them. Which is as it should be because not to 
do so is to lower floodgates of uncertainty and judicial anarchy. Anyone 
aggrieved by the Supreme Court decision can file a petition: for review. 
It would also help if trigger-happy commentators were to wait for the 
full judgment because What has been passed so far is just a short order 
in which all the issues raised and disposed of in the judgment have not 
been dealt with fully. But instead of following the judicious or the 
legal path, everyone is rushing in with intemperate or half-baked 
opinions. Time was when the law of contempt acted as a check on the 
public expression of opinion about judicial matters. Now it seems as if 
half the country is guilty of contempt of court.

Clearly, the verdict in the judges case has far-reaching implications 
for the relationship between the executive and judicial branches. It is 
also plain that the government has not welcomed this judgment for the 
obvious reason that it puts strict curbs on the executive's ability to 
exercise an unhealthy influence over senior judicial appointments and 
transfers. But it should be equally obvious that all sides must exercise 
restraint at this juncture and accept the judgment in the proper spirit. 
The government certainly should muffle its displeasure because when 
ministers and especially the Prime Minister pass adverse remarks against 
a considered opinion of the Supreme Court, they neither serve their own 
cause nor take the lead, as they should, in showing respect for the 
judiciary. We cannot help observing at this point that if the Chief 
Justice was about to address a Press conference, he was most ill-advised 
in thinking along those lines. As a rule, CJs should keep themselves 
aloof from such public exercises. Having given its verdict the Supreme 
Court should be able to look at any adverse reaction with Olympian calm. 

It hardly needs to be emphasised that if the government does not display 
the maturity that it should, it could be inviting a political-cum-
judicial crisis with serious, if as yet indeterminate, consequences for 
the present political system. If we look back at the history of 
Pakistan, governments in this climate have usually been their own worst 
enemies: stirring up troubles for themselves that with a bit of wisdom 
could easily have been avoided and failing to read the obvious on the 
wall. It would be tragic if this pattern is repeated.

<a name="oure">Our equations with the neighbours</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mahdi Masud

IN SPITE of the increasing interaction in the modern world, in important 
fields, economic, political and military, the solvency of a country's 
foreign relations and particularly of its security interests, is 
basically determined by its relations with its neighbours. Non-
neighbouring countries, however powerful, can never be a substitute for 
meaningful cooperation with one's neighbours. A state can choose its 
friends; it has to make do with its neighbours.
    
In the light of recent developments in our relations with our immediate 
neighbours, it would be useful to have a quick survey of the developing 
regional environment involving Iran, Afghanistan, India and Russia.
    
In the case of Iran, the cracks and fissures in Pakistan- Iran relations 
continue to appear with disturbing regularity, not only in relation to 
Afghanistan but with respect to other issues as well. The rapidly 
sharpening divergence in the attitude of the two countries towards 
Afghanistan has been highlighted by the recent accords between the 
Iranian government and President Rabbani on the extension of Iranian 
assistance to Kabul.
    
The radically different nature of Iran's and Pakistan's relations with 
the US fosters mutual suspicions which are also fuelled by our close 
relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states whose ties with Iran 
are problematical.
    
The contradictions in Pak-Iran relations, posed by the above 
divergences, are being exploited by India. The speed with which 
relationships have changed in the region is illustrated by the contrast 
between the close Indo-Iran relations as at present and the fact that 
barely three years back Iran was described in the annual report of the 
Indian ministry of external affairs as constituting a security threat to 
India by virtue of Tehran's close relations with Pakistan.
    
Our continuing problems with the Kabul regime have been sharpened by 
Rabbani's reaction to the proposed reconstruction of the Chaman-
Torghunday road by Pakistan as provided for in the tripartite agreement 
between Pakistan, Afghanistan and Turkemenistan. The issue highlights 
the constitutional anarchy prevailing in Afghanistan. A proposal for 
reconstructing the route to Central Asian states through western 
Afghanistan is seen as a violation of Kabul regime's claimed 
jurisdiction over areas controlled by other Afghan groups such as the 
Taliban.
    
Pakistan authorities should ensure that the resources and services 
planned to be put into use for the project do not become a hostage to 
the hazards of a battle-zone which western Afghanistan may soon become. 
A proposal has been made that the road should be constructed by NGOs 
rather than by government agencies.
    
The price we have paid for Afghanistan's freedom from the Soviet yoke 
makes it all the more important that we re-establish our credentials 
with all Afghan groups to enable Pakistan to play its due role in 
restoring peace and normality and in the reconstruction of war-ravaged 
Afghanistan.
    
While the US aid package extended to us as recompense for our front-line 
role in the Afghan war was terminated soon after the war, the 
destabilisation of Pakistan, particularly of Sindh (through arms and 
drugs trafficking, heightened corruption and diversion of arms to crime 
Mafias and ethnic groups) is a tragic legacy of our Afghan involvement 
which would take decades to resolve.
    
Of all the countries that matter to us, the least movement is visible in 
our relations with Russia in spite of the changed situation following 
the end of the cold war. While in the altered context. India has been 
able to establish close and mutually advantageous relations with both 
the US and Russia, Pakistan's ties with the latter appear to be even 
colder and more distant than what they were during the days of the cold 
war, when we were allied to the US.
    
The latest development is Russia's reported offer to sell to India most 
of its defence technology, comprising some one hundred and fifty weapons 
systems, including the latest 300 mm multiple-launch rockets. This was 
revealed by the deputy director-general of Russia's arms export agency. 
This has also been confirmed by the Russian ambassador in Delhi. Earlier 
in 1994, Russia had agreed to sell Mig-29s to India and upgrade Mig-21 
planes.
    
While there is divergence in Moscow and Islamabad's attitude towards 
Kabul, this is not an adequate explanation for Moscow's coldness, which 
is a product apparently of New Delhi's pressure and of Russian anxiety 
to preserve its vast stakes in India, in political, economic and 
military fields, and not to allow these to be significantly eroded by 
the new turn in Indo-US relations following the end of the cold war.
    
The dangers for Pakistan in strained or indifferent relationship with 
all its neighbours, with the exception of China, are magnified by the 
drift in our deteriorating relations with India in the context of the 
ongoing freedom struggle in Kashmir. The imminent deployment of the 
Pirthvi missiles and reported plans for another nuclear test by India 
have heightened our security concerns.
    
Meanwhile, India is exploiting the interest being shown by the US for 
Indian cooperation in the Indian ocean. Indian leverage with the US has 
increased because of the continuing US problems with China in a number 
of areas. US defence official. Richard Cheyney, has been quoted in the 
Press as warning the Indians about a return to the euphoria of Hindi- 
Cheeni bhai bhai days. The expedition of the Indian peace-keeping force 
to Sri Lanka and Indian intervention in the Maldives had received 
plaudits from the US.
    
In the case of China, India continues a double-faced policy. While 
assurances of abiding peace and friendship are given to China, US 
officials are told that China was central to India's nuclear planning. 
The fact that while China could reach the plains of northern India with 
bombers and short-range missile based in Tibet, India would need 
nuclear-capable missiles with the range of 3200 kilometres to reach the 
heartland of China, is given as the explanation for India's objective of 
building a credible, missile-based deterrent vis-a-vis China.
    
However, India's hegemonistic designs over South Asia, which are the key 
to India's military build-up, are betrayed by India's acts and 
pronouncements. Brahma Chellany, one of India's leading scholars of 
nuclear strategy and Professor of Strategic Research at Delhi's 
Institute of Policy Research, wrote on February 26 1996, in The 
International Herald Tribune: "The Sino-Pakistan umbilical cord would 
snap only if India can stand up to China; as long as this does not 
happen, the (Chinese) policy of building a countervailing power 
(Pakistan), south of the Himalayas would develop firmer roots."
    
It is unfortunate that the prospects of election year uncertainty in 
India are not an encouraging portent for a breakthrough in Indo-Pakistan 
relations. Although at this stage, the outcome of the elections cannot 
be assessed with any degree of certainty, the prospects are for a 
coalition or a minority government supported by other groups to emerge.
    
South Asia is being rapidly left behind other regions in the economic 
race. The governments of India and Pakistan owe it to their billion-plus 
people to reach an early settlement of the Kashmir dispute which 
epitomises the political conflict between the two countries and retards 
the establishment of durable peace in the region. It is wrong to blame 
in this connection the rigidity of public opinion alone. For if the 
leaders and opinion makers in the two countries, who are expected to 
mould and not merely reflect public opinion, were to show statesmanship, 
the process of preparing the public mind for a fair settlement would be 
set in motion.

<a name="verd">Verdict in the judges case</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

THE judgment delivered by the Supreme Court in the so-called judges case 
in which recent appointments to the higher judiciary were questioned on 
the grounds of being against the provisions of the Constitution is 
likely to be as far-reaching in its implications as the decision of the 
Supreme Court in 1993 when it held the dismissal of the National 
Assembly to be invalid. What is more, the present decision is likely to 
be as discomfiting for this government as the one in 1993 was for 
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.

The main burden of this case rested upon an interpretation of Articles 
177 and 193 of the Constitution. These articles state that appointments 
to the superior judiciary that is, to the Supreme Court and the four 
high courtsare to be made by the President of Pakistan after 
consultation" with the chief justices concerned. The principal question 
posed on this case was as to what was the nature of the consultation 
envisaged by the Constitution: a formality which the government had to 
observe or something more substantial? In words that leaves little room 
for doubt, the Supreme Court has held that "(the) words 'after 
consultation'... connote that the consultation should be effective, 
meaningful, purposive, consensus-oriented, leaving no room for complaint 
of arbitrariness or unfair play. The opinion of the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan and the Chief Justice of a high court as to the fitness and 
suitability of a candidate for judgeship is entitled to be accepted in 
the absence of very sound reasons to be recorded by the 
President/Executive." This part of the order would suggest that the last 
word in the matter of senior judicial appointments still remains with 
the President who may differ with a chief justice for "very sound 
reasons". The very next part of the order, however, seems to strike this 
implication down when it says: "That if the President /Executive 
appoints a candidate found to be unfit and unsuitable for Judgeship by 
the Chief Justice of the high court concerned, it will not be a proper 
exercise of power under the relevant article of the Constitution." Thus 
what the order seems to leave open at one place is slammed shut in the 
next. Leaving the appointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan aside (a 
question which the order specifically says it is not going into), all 
other appointments to the superior judiciary must bear the stamp of 
"consultation" as just defined by the Supreme Court if they are not to 
be invalid.

The Supreme Court has also frowned upon the practice of appointing 
'acting' chief justices in the high courts and ad hoc judges both at the 
a ex level and in the provinces. Permanent vacancies in the offices of 
chief justice and judges "should be filled in immediately, and not later 
than 30 days..." Furthermore, no ad-hoc judge can be appointed in the 
Supreme Court while permanent vacancies exist. In-the high courts the 
senior-most judge should normally be appointed chief justice barring 
sound reasons to be recorded by the President. Transfers of chief 
justices and other judges to the Federal Shariat Court without the 
consent of the persons affected have-been held to be violative of the 
Constitution. A transfer of a judge from one high court to another "can 
only be made in the public interest and not as a punishment."

The thrust of this order is thus quite clear. At one stroke it does away 
with the discretion of the executive authority in the matter of 
appointing judges to the superior judiciary. It also removes the sword 
of Damocles hanging over judges in the shape of the power to transfer 
them arbitrarily from one court to another and especially to the Federal 
Shariat Court which more than anything else has been the dumping ground 
of undesirable judges. The independence of the judiciary which over the 
years has been steadily eroded by executive arbitrariness has thus been 
upheld. If judges cannot be masters in their own house, as they 
manifestly have not been for the greater part of Pakistan's history, how 
are they to dispense justice without fear or favour? This judgment, 
therefore, is a significant decision which will rank among the other 
memorable judgements of the superior judiciary in this country.

To say as much, however, should not mean closing one's eyes to a danger 
lurking in the opposite direction. While executive meddling in the 
affairs of the judiciary has circumscribed judicial independence and 
also given the judiciary a bad name and an image of turning with the 
wind, the strengthening of judicial independence should not mean 
judicial arbitrariness in the form of unnecessary clashes with the 
executive. If the exercise of power has been arbitrary in this country, 
it should not be irrelevant to recall that the superior judiciary has 
gone along with and even sanctified the more memorable constitutional 
deviations in the nation's history. If this judgment gives the judiciary 
greater security, with this should come a greater graciousness and a 
less arbitrary recourse on the part of the judiciary to the law of 
contempt which in this country has often been used to stifle justified 
criticism that has been warranted either by the behaviour of individual 
judges or acts of the judiciary as a whole.

The most important thing at this juncture, however, is for the 
government to accept this judgment in the right-spirit. Had the 
government's actions been governed by a modicum of wisdom. there 
probably would have been no occasion for such a petition and such a 
judgment. But some recent appointments to the superior judiciary had 
been carried out with so scant a regard for competence and judicial 
ability that a storm of criticism had arisen. What is immediately at 
stake is the future of the judges whose tenures were confirmed by the 
government with ill-concealed haste right on the eve of the Supreme 
Court judgment. The government's first reaction to this judgment which 
was given forth by the state-controlled APP was unfortunate as it seemed 
to give the impression that the government was questioning this 
judgment. Better sense should prevail. Even if some judges whose 
appointments may have been dictated by political considerations have to 
be sacrificed as a result of the Supreme Court verdict, the government 
should not hesitate to do this.

What it must avoid at all costs is a needless conflict with the 
judiciary. What the Supreme Court has done is to reaffirm a basic truth: 
that with executive interference and meddling, the notion of an 
independent judiciary is violated. Just as after the 1993 decision of 
the Supreme Court any future president will think twice before 
dismissing the National Assembly, governments will now have to consider 
hard before interfering with the judiciary. This is a development to be 
welcomed as long as judicial assertion is contained within the bounds 
prescribed by the Constitution. The judiciary is the guarantor and 
interpreter of the Constitution. By remaining true to this function it 
can strengthen the state by promoting a harmonious relationship among 
the three organs of the state.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="jans">Jansher eliminated from Super Series final</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

LONDON, March 23: Jansher Khan, whose two-year unbeaten run on the PSA 
world circuit came to an end. Khan, who lost to Englands Del Harris 
his first loss since losing to Scotlands Peter Nicol in February 1994 
in the Leekes Classic  was knocked out of the finals when Harris went 
on to gain his third successive victory.
    
Harris had needed five games to bring down the great Pakistani but now 
required only three to overcome Mark Chaloner, a fellow member of 
Englands world title winning squad in Cairo four months ago.
    
Harris trailed 5-8 in the third game and Chaloner had two chances to 
take it to a fourth, but the world number six attacked at great pace 
with drops, drives and volleys  and defended almost as acrobatically as 
he had against Jansher  and came out the winner by 9-1, 9-6, 1O-8.
    
That earned Harris top place in the group and a contest in the Super 
Series final against the world number three Brett Martin.

Jansher has been left to battle for third place in a match against the 
world number two Rodney Eyles, an encounter he earned by overcoming the 
British champion from Scotland Peter Nicol 9-7, 1O-8, 9-3. </pre>
