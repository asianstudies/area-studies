-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Sept 26: President Farooq Leghari told Opposition Leader Nawaz 
Sharif he would act according to the Constitution and invoke Article 58 (2) 
(b) if the national interest so demanded. The article gives the president 
authority to dissolve the assembly and dismiss the government in case of a 
breakdown of the constitutional machinery.

A press statement issued by the presidency after a three-hour meeting 
between Mr Leghari and Mr Sharif said: The president took  note of the 
contention of the leader of the opposition that the government was not 
being run in accordance with the Constitution and action should, therefore, 
be taken under Article 58(2) (b) of the Constitution. The president stated 
that this was a matter that lay in his discretion. He said he would act in 
accordance with the constitutional provision if the supreme national 
interest so demanded.

This was the first meeting between the president and the leader of the 
opposition after Mr Leghari was elected president in November, 1993.  The 
president said that all the points raised by the leader of the opposition 
were crucial national issues that should have been debated and resolved by 
parliament. The government and the opposition should have sat together to 
agree on the arrangements and modalities for fair and free elections to the 
national and provincial assemblies.  In any case, as and when elections 
are held, the president would perform his constitutional duty, and exercise 
all the powers available to him, and ensure that the elections are 
conducted honestly, justly, fairly and in accordance with the Constitution 
and Law, the statement said.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 26: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said some people had 
started conspiracies against her government but vowed to fight against the 
enemies of democracy.

Informed sources told Dawn the prime minister told visitors at the prime 
ministers house that she knew some people had started working on a 
timetable to illegally remove her government. However, she declared that 
she would fight till last to save democracy in Pakistan. She regretted that 
the vested interests had not even realised that she was so much grieved and 
disturbed over the death of her brother, Murtaza Bhutto.

"ources said she told her senior party leaders that Nawaz Sharif was trying 
to destabilise her government. But the prime minister pointed out that she 
would not give in. Ms Bhutto further said that those who got her father and 
two brothers killed were now trying to get her killed and added she was not 
among those who run away.  The prime minister said Bhuttos always 
sacrificed for the people of their country and that if need arose she would 
not hesitate to give her life, but would not compromise on principles. She 
alleged that the leader of the opposition was a product of martial law and 
so did not accept her truly elected government.

LAHORE, Sept 30: Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif says Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto has gone to the United States without a mandate from the nation and 
in case she signs any agreement there, the country will be under no 
obligation to honour it.

"I want to make it clear that if the prime minister signs any agreement 
during her stay in the United States, the country will not be bound to 
honour it. She has gone without getting a mandate from the nation," Mr 
"harif said while addressing a mashaikh convention organised by Ittehadul 
Mashaikh Pakistan here on Monday.

He said unlike the practice in other countries, the Benazir government did 
not take parliament into confidence on any important issue, including the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), and it had always bypassed the 
assembly on major policy issues.

The prime minister, he said, had gone to the United States to get a loan of 
$700 million for which she was seeking appointments with various senior 
officials. "There is no use in visiting such countries which give you no 
respect."

The opposition leader deplored the existing state of affairs and said the 
problems were so many that it would be extremely difficult for any future 
ruler to put the country back on the rails.

Mr Sharif said the devaluation of the rupee had failed to increase exports. 
On the contrary, he said, imports were going up day by day which was not a 
good sign.

LONDON, Sept 30: Kashmir and Afghanistan the two topics and a range of 
other bilateral, regional and international issues were discussed when the 
visiting Pakistan Prime Minister, Ms Benazir Bhutto, called on the British 
Prime Minister John Major for talks which lasted for more than an hour. 
Soon after the talks Ms Bhutto, who had an overnight stay in London, left 
for New York.
    
British officials pointed out that Ms Bhutto was not on an official visit 
here but as she is most welcome to Britain anytime she comes, Mr Major 
invited her for talks. The request was received relatively recently from 
the Pakistan Prime Minister, according to official sources, and Mr Major 
took the opportunity to discuss with her the latest developments in South 
Asia, including Kashmir and Afghanistan.
    
Downing Street sources described the meeting as "warm and cordial". The 
British Prime Minister specifically mentioned the Comprehensive Test Ban 
"reaty and said in order to see progress towards nuclear disarmament 
Britain would like that everyone should sign it. Ms Bhutto explained 
Pakistan's position on the CTBT and blamed India for creating obstacles in 
its way.

On Kashmir, the Prime Minister repeated Pakistan's plea for third party 
mediation to resolve the issue. She said Britain could play a role in this 
respect. The British position, which is that it would only agree to mediate 
between the two sides provided both India and Pakistan asked it to do so, 
was reiterated by the British Prime Minister. 

The recent developments in Afghanistan were also discussed and Mr Major 
heard Ms Bhutto's assessment of the situation following the Taliban capture 
of Kabul. Britain is still watching the situation with caution and has not 
committed itself on recognising the Taliban government.
    
At the start of the meeting Mr Major conveyed his condolences to Ms Benazir 
Bhutto over the death of her brother, Murtaza Bhutto.

UNITED NATIONS, Oct 2: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has called upon the 
international community and the Ummah to fulfil their obligations towards 
the suffering Kashmiri people, squarely, and without concern for the 
political or commercial expediency.
    
In a speech to a large gathering of foreign ministers and envoys from 
Islamic nations on Wednesday morning, the Prime Minister said that time had 
come for the international community to squarely deal with the Kashmir 
issue. "Political or commercial expediencies must not be allowed to erode 
the foundations of the international system," she said.
    
Ms Bhutto referred to the Indian atrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir 
and stressed that "time and again India has sought to shroud the Kashmir 
dispute in sham elections to deceive public opinion."
    
She said the voter turnout in the sham elections held in four stages this 
September was less than 2 per cent, and maintained that the total boycott 
of Indian elections by the Kashmiris was a clear referendum in which the 
Kashmiri people rejected the sham elections, and rejected Indian 
occupation.
    
Calling upon the United Nations to fulfil its historic responsibility 
towards the people of Kashmir, Ms Bhutto underscored, "as far as we are 
concerned, the only legitimate dispute, the only legitimate call for self-
determination lies in resolutions already sanctified in the United Nations 
Security Council, as on Kashmir."
    
She said: "If the United Nations fails to act, it will compel the Kashmiris 
to continue to wage their heroic struggle to reverse the occupation by all 
possible means."

<a name="usto">US to send diplomats to Kabul</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Oct 1: The United States will soon send its diplomats to Kabul 
to begin its contacts with the Taliban government but the US Embassy was 
not being opened this week, the State Department said on Monday.
    
"I don't believe that we have any American diplomats in Kabul right now. I 
think we'd like to have some diplomats travel there to make contact with 
the Taliban. We'll have to assess when and how to do that," Spokesman Nick 
Burns told the afternoon briefing.
    
His detailed statement marked a slight shift in the US policy towards the 
new government as Burns "condemned" the killing of late President 
Najibullah while spokesman Glyn Davies had on Friday only "regretted" the 
killings.

When pointed out that last week, the official response of this government 
to the Taliban marching into Kabul seemed to be a wait-and-see attitude, to 
see what they would do, is the U.S. now rethinking its position?
    
Burns response was as follows: "I don't know -- we've not changed our 
position. You know, the situation on the ground is quite murky. As we 
understand it, the Taliban has had a string of military successes, is 
pretty much in control of Kabul. But I think it's also true that the former 
government forces, including some significant military forces, are 
operating in the northern part of Afghanistan. There have been a lot of 
discussions with some of the leaders up there, and it's not at all clear 
that the Taliban have control over all of Afghanistan. In fact, it's fairly 
clear that they do not.
    
It's not at all clear to us that they have established a functioning 
government in Kabul or in the areas that they control. Let me just say a 
few things about our relationship to these events. We have maintained a 
relationship with Afghanistan. We have not broken diplomatic relations with 
Afghanistan, but we've not had an Embassy there since 1989 because of the 
civil war and the fighting.
    
We will have to decide at some point in the future when to re-establish an 
Embassy, but I don't believe there's any serious thought about doing that 
this week. We've not had an American Ambassador there, I think, since 1979, 
when, tragically, Ambassador Spike Dubs was assassinated, and we haven't 
forgotten that.
    
We have maintained contact over the years with all the major factions --
people who used to be in charge in Kabul; some of the military faction 
leaders throughout the country -- and Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel has 
met with Taliban representatives in both Washington and Afghanistan this 
year.
    
It remains to be seen what kind of government is going to be formed there, 
and we'll have to watch the situation very closely. We have consistently 
raised with all authorities in Afghanistan -- and this includes the Taliban 
-- issues of great concern to the United States: terrorism, narcotics, human 
rights including due process, and the treatment of women, which is a major 
issue for the United States, and we'll continue to raise those issues.
    
I can also tell you that the United States, of course, joins in the 
condemnation by the United Nations of the summary execution of Mr. 
Najibullah and his associates. We condemn those summary executions, and 
we've been very clear about that.

<a name="govt">Govt agencies not fit to handle crisis situations</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Intikhab Hanif

LAHORE, Oct 2: None of the law enforcing agencies or the district 
administrations in the Punjab know specifically how to react to crisis 
situations like bomb blasts and sectarian violence.

This has been pointed by the provincial Home Department in a report which 
was sent to Governor Raja Saroop Khan on Sunday. The report was based on 
the findings of a team which visited Multan, Bahawalpur and Dera Ghazi Khan 
under the leadership of provincial Home Secretary Humayun Farshori late 
last week to ascertain reasons of the endemic sectarianism there.

Keeping in view the situation, the report said, the provincial Home 
Department had already directed each district to prepare a Standard 
Operational Procedure, to define duties of each agency and officer in case 
of a crisis, enabling the administration to control damage and to trace 
culprits at the earliest.

Standard Operational Procedures are routinely prepared and implemented by 
army to effectively tackle any situation. The civil administration has an 
SOP only in case of hijacking of a plane.

<a name="kset">KSE to do normal business on Friday</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 1: The Karachi Stock Exchange will do normal business next 
Friday with a break of 90 minutes from 1 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. for lunch and 
prayers and observe Sunday as a weekly holiday from this week.
    
A press release announced that the decision was taken by the general body 
of all the members on Tuesday to do business on Friday despite the fact 
that stock market is primarily connected with the working of banks and 
financial institutions to express solidarity with the business community.

Since the banks and financial institutions will remain closed on Friday for 
want of a decision from the State Bank of Pakistan as provided in the 
Banking Companies Act, the general body meeting decided to review the 
decision after one month to consider as to which weekly holidays would be 
followed by the financial institutions and banks at that time because 
uniformity between stock market and financial institutions and banks is 
necessary to make the entire arrangements useful and meaningful.
   
While Karachi Stock Exchange in its general body meeting on Tuesday 
endorsed the decision of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce 
and Industry, a prominent broker of Karachi Stock Exchange was confident 
that it would not take too long for stock markets at Lahore and Islamabad 
to fall in line as 'their 75 per cent sale deeds are executed in Karachi.'

Some members of KSE believe that government would be forced to  declare 
Sunday a holiday and Friday a working day after the majority of the 
businessmen all over the country decided to do so.
    
Enquiries made with the private banks revealed that Private Banks 
Association has already approached the State Bank of Pakistan to allow them 
to operate on Friday and to observe Sunday as a closed weekly holiday.

But when the central leadership of the business community at the apex body 
is claiming overwhelming support, a large number of traders from one of the 
biggest retailers and wholesalers enclave in Karachi, Jodia Bazar assembled 
on Tuesday to declare that observing Sunday a weekly holiday is 'a 
conspiracy of the secularists.'
    
Organised by a former Vice President of Karachi Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry Mr H.M. Hanif, participants of the meeting included retailers and 
leaders representing religious and political parties.

Our Correspondent from Islamabad adds: The Islamabad Stock Exchange has not 
taken any decision on the issue of weekly holiday as yet, a spokesman of 
ISE told Dawn on Tuesday.

Even if ISE follows the KSE's lead, an interesting situation is likely to 
arise because the President of Lahore Stock Exchange, Mr Noshir, has 
decided that Friday would continue to be the weekly holiday so far as LSE 
is concerned.

<a name="wher">Where the population welfare programme goes awry</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nina Gera

SOMETHING is amiss somewhere with the governments population welfare 
programme, despite all the proclamations to the contrary and minor 
successes in certain aspects.

Over the past 30 years, a stupendous sum of Rs 30 billion has been spent on 
the population welfare programme (PWP) and even then it seems like pouring 
water through a sieve. In 1965, the population growth rate was estimated to 
be 2.9 per cent and the idea then was to scale it down to 2.4 percent. 
Instead, it soared to 3.1 percent before settling down to 2.9 percent  the 
same as it was 21 years ago. Today, we have one of the highest rates among 
145 countries of the world. Despite the absence of a census to ascertain 
the exact figure, the estimated population of Pakistan is now 131.63 
million (Economic Survey 1995-96).

More cause for worry is the fact that the under-five mortality rate remains 
stagnant at 137 per 1,000 since the last 10 years and the maternal 
mortality rates persists at the high level of 500 per 10,000 women. The 
fertility rate again, which it was hoped would fall, has, in fact, 
increased from 5.9 percent to 6.1 percent and until something drastic is 
done in the near future, will stay put at that level.

Harsh realities:

Organisations such as the United Nations Fund for Population Activities 
(UNFPA) have categorically stated that Pakistan may, at present, be a 
developing country but would sink to the status of a least developed 
country if, in the year 2025, the population increases to 284.8 million. It 
is about time the government woke up to the harsh reality and did their 
utmost to tackle this Herculean task, on a war footing.

It is not easy to accurately pinpoint exactly what is going wrong with the 
programme, but it is amply evident where there definitely is room for 
improvement. For one, certain experts in the field have commented that the 
primary hindrance to the success of the programme is the conservative 
forces which have a very strong hold on the populace, particularly in the 
rural areas. Educated clerics, however, willingly accept the concept of 
family planning. It is the illiterate ones who put spokes in the wheel. The 
examples of Bangladesh and Indonesia, countries with far more successful 
family planing programmes than ours, come to mind were the ulema have been 
made part and parcel of the programme. Perhaps more could be done on this 
front, to really convince our clergy. No mean task, this, but imperative 
nevertheless. 

And, it is by no means impossible since as an official of the Population 
Welfare Department (PWD) of the Punjab government said, the Imams of 
mosques in the rural areas are known to announce the arrival of the mobile 
service units in the villages. What is more, a strategy has been followed 
in the past to send enlightened Ulema from the urban areas as members of 
delegations abroad and they have also been invited to attend seminars 
across the country. However, we cannot be expected to achieve the same 
degree of integration of the conservative elements in the programme as 
Bangladesh and Indonesia.

The government on the other hand is strapped for cash. The fault, however, 
lies not so much in the inadequacy of funds as in their use. The federal 
government finances 65 percent of the programme. The total development 
allocation for population welfare during the Eighth five-year Plan (1993-
98) is Rs 9.1 billion. The funds appear to be adequately utilised as is 
evident from the figures for 1991-92 when the allocation was Rs 636.3 
million, all of which was utilised. In 1990-91 the programme was allocated 
Rs 598.4 million but used Rs 653.1 million (SAP committee report on the 
Eighth Plan).

"here is also a considerable amount of foreign assistance forthcoming, with 
the World Bank and Asian Development Bank providing loans while the British 
organisation ODA doles out grants. Incidentally there is ample room for 
seepage. If the slightest opportunity comes his way, an official in such 
departments will cash in on it. The honest are a rare breed. And 
accountability is totally lacking in our nation today. Finances are treated 
in an extremely amateurish manner, leaving vast scope for hiding the 
corrupt elements and wastage of resources. Another flaw, somewhat minor at 
first sight, is that the plans are replete with nebulous terms and lack 
grossly in clarity. Those who are responsible for implementing the plans 
have no clear idea as to how to explicitly follow the strategies.

Indiscipline

The family welfare centres are notorious for the indiscipline of their 
staff and irregular attendance. These centres invariably remain closed and 
this naturally affects the contraceptive distribution targets. Despite 
these shortcomings, the FWCs are indispensable and continue to be 
maintained at an exorbitant cost. 
   
"o remedy the situation somewhat, a former secretary of the Punjab PWD took 
special interest in this aspect and started what is known as the flying 
squad surprise visit teams which did improve attendance and performance of 
the staff to some extent. Still, the general impression is that especially 
in far-flung areas where the staff do not belong to that particular area, 
this remains a chronic problem. The coverage of population welfare services 
in villages is hardly something to be proud of. It is hoped that by the end 
of the Eighth five-year Plan, coverage will be at least 70 percent in rural 
areas and 100 percent in the urban areas.

Other shortcomings include the weak system of monitoring and evaluation, 
persistent political interference in the functioning of the department and 
the virtually total absence of focus on quality of services. As per 
political interference, this is evident in the frequent postings and 
transfers of officials of the department and this obviously affects the 
overall programme as well as its monitoring.

Lack of follow-up:

Aside from the fact that recruitment is often done on political grounds and 
not on merit, the family planning staff themselves are status-wise on a 
fairly low rung of the bureaucratic ladder. Unfortunately this is the case 
with all social sector services. Again, males are seldom part of the target 
population especially in rural areas. Women are the focus of all efforts. 
This apparently is now being changed and there are some male vasectomy 
centres  three in the Punjab and their number is likely to increase in the 
not-too-distant future. The mobile clinics are poorly equipped. The main 
complaint regarding those units is that follow-up care and treatment are 
lacking and this is usually left to the village-based family planning 
workers (VBFPW) which is by no means as effective as it ought to be.
    
The VBFPW revolves around the theme of self-help. It aims to bring about 
community participation, through the creation of awareness, changed 
attitudes and support mobilisation. One of the objectives of the programme 
is doorstep service to the villagers. Sounds all very well, but there are 
hitches. As an official of the PWD pointed out, supervision could be far 
better and the government has to ensure the payment of salaries. It is 
planned that by 1998, there will be as many as 112,000 Lady Health Visitors 
(LHV) in the country. That would cost the government a minimum of Rs 4 
billion per annum, not a paltry amount by any means. Can the government 
really ensure this? Or more importantly, is it willing to do so?

Hope:

However, all is not despair. There has been a considerable amount of 
decentralisation of authority. The FWCs now have a revolving fund for their 
own expenses therefore, do not have to constantly refer to headquarters for 
their expenditures. Policy matters are, of course, decided at the federal 
level but minor decision-making is left to the discretion of the staff. 
Initially, salaries of the staff and officials would often be paid well 
after they were due, but now they are promptly paid every month.

On the whole, the supply situation of contraceptives is much better as the 
distribution system has vastly improved since early 1995. Non-governmental 
organisations (NGOs) are now involved in the rural areas and there is a far 
better sense of co-operation. In short, it is more of an integrated rather 
than an isolated effort. Perhaps the major flaw in the entire set-up is the 
absence of a population census, and until this is undertaken, the entire 
programme will be based largely on guesstimates, seriously hampering the 
entire planning process. There is a corollary here, however. One of the 
most facile things in life is to sit back and criticise without giving the 
devil his due. There is much to be lauded in the programme, criticisms 
such as the above notwithstanding.

One could question the very rationale of family planning as a government 
priority. Should not other sectors such as education, nutrition, health and 
shelter be developed concomitantly with efforts at reducing population 
growth? As Amartya Sen and other radical economists have pointed out, ... 
the emergency mentality based on false beliefs in imminent cataclysms leads 
to breathless responses that are deeply counter-productive, preventing the 
development of rational and sustainable family planning.

Of course, there are reasons for anxiety about the long-term effects of 
population growth on the environment and there are equally valid reasons 
for concern about the adverse effects of high birth rates on the quality of 
life, particularly that of women. The only point is that population control 
in isolation will not suffice. It has to go along with other forms of 
socio-economic development. There is no need for a Malthusian approach to 
the problem in todays world. Malthus anticipated horrific disasters 
resulting from population growth.

Suggestions and solutions

What, then, ought to be done? There are certain determinants of success 
which are briefly listed hereunder:

For one, the leadership has to be more dedicated and committed with a clear 
vision and objective. This seems like a tall order because of the lack of 
motivation and incentive resulting from relatively low salary structure of 
the department but it can be left to those at the helm of affairs to 
inspire and motivate them. There should also an element of flexibility in 
the strategies and programmes and with new experience gained, fresh and 
innovative ideas can be experimented with.

Management should be supportive and at the same time, strict. This makes 
for a more effective programme. An uninterrupted supply of contraceptives 
should be ensured. With more work at the grassroots level, attempts should 
be made to mobilise community participation, increase demand and generate 
local accountability. To encourage participation at the community level, 
greater efforts could be made to spread the word as it were and involve 
more and more people in the programme.

"here should also be an integrated approach at the grassroots level and the 
programme should come as a package with poverty alleviation and other felt 
needs components such as education, nutrition and sanitation. This 
package approach is claimed to be the main thrust of the present 
governments Social Action Programme (SAP), as was pointed out at a recent 
workshop held in Lahore. The programme has thus far met with limited 
success.

The government has also been trying to combine health with family planning 
but this, by itself is not adequate and other developmental components need 
to be combined with it. Better care, including follow-up services, could be 
provided to the clientele as there is a glaring shortcoming in the 
programme which requires immediate attention. For instance, worker-client 
ratio could be improved. The training of the workers could be more intense 
and rigorous than has been the case hitherto.

<a name="paki">Pakistans tough choices in talks with IMF</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

PAKISTAN has been given a tough choice by the IMF: "accept a substantial 
cut in the defence budget, enact federal legislation for imposing 
agriculture tax and freeze budget deficit at 4 percent of GDP or forego any 
future lending".

The government is said to have decided to accept these new tough 
conditionalities that are contained in a new package now with the Prime 
Ministers Advisor on Finance, Mr V.A. Jafarey, who left for Washington to 
conduct what is being termed as crucial negotiations with the IMF 
authorities.

Mr Jafarey, officials said, would be having for the first time, a joint 
meeting with the authorities of the IMF, the World Bank and the IFC to 
discuss wide range of issues to help resume the third tranche of $ 80 
million out of $ 600 million Stand-by Arrangement (SBA).

"alking points:

Mr Jafarey and the finance ministry officials have been finalising talking 
points for the upcoming discussions with the IMF. Since it was becoming 
difficult even to restrict the deficit to five percent, freezing it at four 
percent would be almost impossible. Hence, the consensus among the 
officials was that the Fund be frankly informed about it. However, Mr 
Jafarey reportedly disagreed with the officials and said: If the 
government tells the IMF that it is not in a position to have the deficit 
frozen at four per cent, then there is no chance for the lending programme 
to be resumed and for the conclusion of another $ 3 billion Extended 
Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) programme.

He proposed that the government must try to achieve the four percent 
deficit target and assure the IMF that some progress would definitely be 
made to cut the defence budget and introduce a law that would call for 
effectively imposing an agriculture tax. Also the package included 
assurances for seriously trying to cut non-development expenditure.

Before leaving for Washington, Mr Jafarey wanted to see Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto to inform her about the new package to be presented to the 
IMF for the resumption of its lending programme. Since she was in Larkana 
in connection with the death of her brother Mir Murtaza Bhutto, Mr Jafarey 
is said to have called on President Farooq Leghari on September 23 and 
obtained approval of the new package.

Mr Leghari agreed with Mr Jafarey that it would not be advisable to even 
slightly slash the deficit target and that all efforts should be made to 
achieve it. In this regard he is said to have referred to other donor 
agencies and foreign banks and in case they were not forthcoming to offer 
any assistance there would be a problem to manage the balance of payment 
position and foreign debt retirement. The President believed that 
Pakistans relations with the donor agencies should not go sour, needless 
to say that foreign banks will also start towing the IMF line and stop 
offering loans.

Assurances

Before leaving, Mr Jafarey was contacted by this correspondent and asked 
questions relating to his visit. He said: We would be assuring the IMF 
officials that there is no plan to deviate and not achieve the 4 percent 
deficit target. Also we would place before them our plan to effectively 
levy agriculture tax.

He said the IMF has its reservations as to why Pakistan was not imposing 
this tax specially when there existed a big potential for it. According to 
former minister for finance, Dr Mehboob ul Haq, agriculturists earn Rs 500 
billion every year and they do not pay even Rs 100 million in taxes. It was 
in this context that the IMF and other donors started exerting pressure on 
the Pakistan government to go for this tax.

I am confident that I will convince the Fund officials to resume 
assistance to us, Mr Jafarey said, adding that the new ESAF would also be 
discussed, although no figures have been bandied. The previous ESAF had 
allowed $ 1.5 billion. Insiders said that the new ESAF may be for $ 3 
billion.

Responding to a question, the advisor said that it was incorrect to say 
that foreign exchange reserves were at a dangerously low level, they stood 
at $ 1.4 billion. He said there was no threat to the reserves and that it 
was untrue that foreign account holders were withdrawing their deposits. He 
regretted that panic was created by vested interests and said that there 
was no question of freezing foreign accounts.

Asked whether the government also felt threatened that it would not get 
credit from foreign banks, he said so far it had not faced any problem on 
this account. Whenever we feel the need we will borrow from foreign banks 
as our credit position is still sound. It is wrong to say that our credit 
rating has gone down, he claimed. He said non-development expenditure was 
yet another area over which the IMF had expressed concern. We will meet 
their reservations by cutting down.

Insiders are of the opinion that the local IMF Chief, Tariq Shamsuddin, who 
is already in Washington had painted a very dismal picture of Pakistans 
economy before his high officials. He is also said to have told the IMF 
officials that the Pakistan government was not providing him official 
economic data and other information about the state of the economy. He said 
that the government also bypassed him and started talking directly to the 
Fund officials in Washington.

Mr Shamsuddin who has been given a two-room office in the Q Block of the 
Finance Ministry has also complained that while he was helpful to the 
Pakistani officials, they ignored him. He said that he did not mind if the 
officials wanted direct contact with the Fund officials in Washington. 
However it is said that his head office has taken serious notice of his 
complaints which would be discussed with Mr Jafarey.

Officials said they are hopeful about the outcome of the talks but the 
million dollar question is whether Islamabad gets the third instalment of $ 
80 million in October.

<a name="defa">Defaulted upon loans may never be recovered</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem

IN THIS country, economics has always been subservient to politics. It is 
no wonder, therefore, that political influence and connections have been 
superior prerequisites for loans from the Nationalised Commercial Banks 
(NCBs) rather than economic feasibility or financial viability. 

Ever since the commercial banking sector was nationalised by the first 
Bhutto government a quarter of a century ago, government appointed decision 
makers at the banks have had to toe the lines of their political mentors.

After a good 25-year hibernation, the entire political leadership on both 
sides of the political divide has almost all of a sudden woken up to face a 
colossal Rs 120 billion bad loan fiasco. The opposition is now talking 
about the setting up of a Judicial Commission while the government has 
submitted a list of defaulters to the National Assemblys Committee on Law, 
Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. Both the PML and PPP are attempting to 
derive as much political mileage as possible out of their rhetorical 
promises of being serious in recovering the poor nations wealth from the 
so-called loan defaulters. The sad part is that there is absolutely no 
possibility that these promises will ever be fulfilled.

Harsh reality

The hard reality remains that any meaningful amount would never ever be 
recovered from loans already gone sour. To begin with, a strong political 
will is a must. Next in line are effective bankruptcy laws and an efficient 
legal infrastructure. When some of the largest defaulters are politicians 
or their front men, how can an honest political will ever take form? If the 
upright Asfandyar Wali Khan (ANP MNA) is to believed, such committees will 
absolve all ruling party political borrowers of any wrong-doing and if that 
does not happen you can spit on my face.... quipped Wali Khans 
principled son. 

Under different circumstances, even if political will took a concrete form 
we simply lack the required legal apparatus to implement any such will. In 
countries where political will is accompanied by effective bankruptcy laws 
and an efficient legal machinery, recovery of bad loans still remains an 
extremely tedious process whereby a creditor, more as a rule than an 
exception, only manages to recover a fraction of the total outstanding at 
the end of a long drawn-out civil litigation.

Our elected elite have also been making noises about the introduction of 
constitutional amendments or major modifications to the current law in 
order to chastise loan defaulters. How about throwing all defaulters behind 
bars until a full recovery of all outstanding loans? How about freezing 
everybodys assets, or putting them all on to the exit control list (ECL)? 
The mis-appraised law makers of our unfortunate Republic often forget that 
there still is a constitution in force and top it all an activist 
judiciary. The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan in its 
Chapter I of Part II under Fundamental Rights and Principles of Policy, 
states that: No person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in 
accordance with law (Article 9). Article 4 of the Constitution, under 
Right of Individuals states that no action detrimental to the life, 
liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken ..... 
Additionally, there is also the concept of limited liability of directors 
(unless criminal intent can be proven) which has been perfected over the 
past couple of centuries.

Its not that defaulters are a breed that should be sympathised with, but 
who really is the defaulter? In a Pakistani scenario there generally are 
three types of bank borrowers: namely the economic borrowers; political 
borrowers; and connivance borrowers. The first class of borrowers is 
composed of genuine business entities that need credit in order to expand 
or just to continue operating. This class comes prepared with authentic 
business plans, economic feasibilitys and financial viability. If the 
banks credit department concurs with the attainability of goals, satisfied 
with the value of the security being provided and is convinced of the 
borrowers ability along with willingness to repay debt, a loan is usually 
granted. If the forecasts of the borrowers and that of the creditor bank 
proves right both parties-creditor and the debtor-to the transaction win. 
In cases where the economic and financial conjectures somehow become 
erroneous and the debtor becomes unable to pay back as per his commitment, 
the creditor has the option of either liquidate the security or restructure 
the loan. 

It is my estimate that around 25 percent of the defaulted loans actually 
belong to this category. This particular class of borrowers exists wherever 
banking does and the banking system as such puts aside a loan-loss-reserve 
out of its annual profits to cover all such eventualities. Political 
borrowers, on the other hand, may also submit business plans, albeit sham 
ones, but their main thrust is always non-economically based and there 
almost never is a genuine intention to pay back whatever has been borrowed. 
Politically appointed executives of nationalised banks by virtue of owing 
their offices to their political benefactors oblige them, knowing well in 
advance that such loans would eventually go bad. The third category of 
borrowers is beneficiaries of bank loans whereby the government-appointed 
senior bank managers on their own incentive grant loans other to front-men 
or at times to businesses whereby both the debtor and the creditor know 
that the loans would eventually become dud and all parties to the 
transaction agree to share the proceeds of the loan.

>From a technical standpoint, borrowers falling into the first category 
cannot be termed wilful defaulters because they are merely economic 
borrowers and without them we might as well bid the economy goodbye. Mirza 
Mahmood, one of this countrys brightest corporate lawyers, is of the 
opinion that from a purely legal standpoint, a defaulter is one who has 
been declared a defaulter by a court of law. In the eyes of the law, 
publishing a list of names does not amount to much. The Committee on Law, 
Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs can recommend whatever it desires at the 
end of its three-month mandate, but unless a court of law has declared 
somebody a defaulter, the Committees recommendations shall remain 
inapplicable. The Nawaz Sharif government tried to force defendants to 
cough up funds while defending their cases at Banking Tribunals, but all 
such provisions were later discarded by the High Court as being 
unconstitutional and against fundamental rights. Mirza Mahmood, while being 
no friend of defaulters, also maintains that there is no way to by-pass the 
courts (unless of course if one is bent on subverting the entire 
constitution). If the government of the day decides to by-pass proper 
judicial process in the defaulters case, the time is not too far off when 
it will be pressurised to bypass the courts in a queue of other cases (how 
about passing an ordinance that every one who does not agree with the 
government of the day is a criminal?) We should, however, rest assured that 
the Supreme Court shall not be willing to compromise on that account.

The two best friends of bankers around the world continue to be collateral 
and the determination of the ability to service debt. The value of the 
security must be sufficient to satisfy outstanding obligations and the 
debtor shall be able and willing to repay. Barring these two there is not 
much that a banker can do. If a mistakeeither deliberate or technicalhas 
been committed and a loan granted, a creditor whether in Pakistan or 
anywhere else on the face of the planet cannot in most cases expect a full 
recovery of the loan. Two of the worlds leading banks, namely Citibank and 
the Bank of America, over an eight period commencing 1985 have sanctioned 
more than $30 billion in bad loans (all of the debtors falling in the 
economic borrower category). Citibank has appointed a total of $18.5 
billion out of its annual profits to enhance is loan-loss provisions while 
the Bank of America has been forced to set aside $10.121 billion. 

Political mistake

Our leading political minds must understand that in our case the Rs 120 
billion loss has largely been because of a political mistake. Political 
blunders require political solutions. The oppositions Judicial Commission 
or the NAs Committee on Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs would be 
lucky if they could recover a paltry 20 percent of the defaulted amount. 
The Committee can, no doubt, recommend new regulations and amendments to 
the current ones in order to expedite recovery. No new regulations or 
amendments can, however, be violative of the Constitution. In the eyes of 
the Supreme Court, all citizens have rights, be they murderers, dacoits, 
common criminals, or defaulters (the first three under the Criminal Penal 
Code) and the constitution explicitly guarantees those rights.

The name of the banking game really is to avoid the sanctioning of bad 
loans. Allowing the sanctioning of bad loans and then thinking of 
recovering them a few years down the road is as stupid as one could be. The 
best route now is to sell off all government-controlled commercial banks 
and development finance institutions to private operators. Do not allow any 
further political intervention (when PPP took over in 1993 defaulted loans 
were estimated to be Rs 80 billion while during the Junejo- era they stood 
at around Rs 8 billion) and impose a comprehensive ban on the granting of 
any new loans in any shape or form. 

The Committees and the Commissions may, in the meanwhile, work on improving 
the recovery mechanism. At the end of the day we must however, think of 
straightening out our entire social and moral fabric. A piecemeal approach 
has never worked before and it never will in the future.

<a name="talk">Talks with IMF progressing, says Shahab</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Oct 2: "Negotiations between Pakistan and the IMF are 
progressing well and we hope to achieve our goal ," Minister of State for 
Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin said on Tuesday night.
    
In the first official comment on the on-going talks, the minister told 
journalists at a dinner, hosted by the Pakistan Embassy, that the two sides 
were discussing "the nitty gritty."
    
He explained that Pakistan and IMF teams were "discussing everything in 
detail" so that there was no room for different interpretations later of 
whatever was agreed.

As Mr Shahabuddin spoke to the journalists, the leader of the Pakistan 
delegation, V.A. Jafarey, who was also present at the dinner, declined to 
discuss the subject with the newsmen at all.

"I will not respond to your questions," Mr Jafarey said but when the 
newsmen insisted, he reluctantly agreed with the observation of the 
minister that talks were progressing and Pakistan hoped to succeed.
    
Sources said the IMF was sticking to its conditionalities and the meeting 
between Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and the First Deputy MD of IMF, 
Stanley Fisher, in New York might finally decide their fate.

<a name="cvto">CVT on air tickets will yield Rs 600 million this year</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Izharul Hasan Burney

KARACHI, Oct 2: The newly-introduced Capital Value Tax (CVT) on air tickets 
for foreign travel is likely to yield a revenue of about Rs. 600 million 
this year, almost 60 per cent of it from the tickets sold to pilgrims for 
Haj, Umra and for pilgrimage to the other holy places.
    
CVT on air tickets (including PTAs) for foreign travel is to be charged at 
the rate of three per cent of the value of the ticket except in the case of 
NTN card/certificate holders, diplomats, air crew on duty, and dependent 
children (up to 21 years of age) and spouse of the purchaser who is the 
holder of NTN card/certificate.
    
More than 100,000 Pakistanis are expected to proceed on Haj this year. The 
cost of air ticket is likely to be Rs. 25,000. At the rate of three per 
cent of the value of the ticket, they would thus pay CVT of the order of 
Rs. 75 million.
    
On an average, about half a million people proceed for Umra each year.
   
The Umra ticket is likely to cost Rs. 18,000 and this too would be subject 
to three per cent CVT.
   
The aggregate CVT receipt in this case would thus total about Rs. 270 
million.

In any case, the overall CVT receipts from air tickets sold to pilgrims is 
expected to be in the region of Rs. 350 million, relevant sources said.
    
Add to it the normal foreign air traffic which is at least 25,000 each 
month during the lean period and goes up to 40,000 during the peak period.
    
In fact, according to sources in the first month of this financial year the 
net CVT yield from the sale of air ticket for foreign travel exceeded Rs. 
20 million.
    
Considering that the peak foreign air travel months lie ahead, concerned 
circles hope that this may be about Rs. 250 million for 1996-97.

<a name="stoc">Stocks respond bullishly to switch-over to Friday</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 2: Stocks on Wednesday apparently responded bullishly to the 
decision of the Karachi Stock Exchange to switch over to Friday as a 
working day after two decades as the consequent strong rally literally gave 
it the tactical approval of the brokerage houses in general.
    
"here was enthusiasm all around in the rings, not backed by the objective 
conditions but there are reasons to believe the response to this 
significant decision was overwhelming.
    
The investor craze for low-priced base shares is fully reflected in the KSE 
100-share index, which crossed the barrier of 1,400 points, recovering 
25.42 points at 1,410.85 as compared to 1,385.43 a day earlier.
    
"The breach of the 1,400-point barrier for the third time in 
the recent past has fully demonstrated the fact that the market has at last 
found its resistance level around 1,380 points", said a leading dealer.
    
But some others were not inclined to toe his perception and claimed it was 
too early to predict about the near-term direction of the market as the 
situation is fraught with high risks in a highly polarised political 
scenario.
    
But some leading stock analysts thought otherwise and predicted that the 
market has already found cue to the coming political events and after 
having absorbed the crises period is now well on the road to a sustained 
recovery.

"The current assertion of the president about rules of the political game 
and even-handed dealings to the complaints of contenders of power has given 
a tremendous boost to the market sentiment", they maintained.
    
And added to it are prospects of resumption of aid and stuck up loan after 
the current parleys being held in Washington between the Pakistan team and 
the donor countries, they added.
    
"hus, it was not a single factor but a combination of several positive 
factors, which put the market back on the rails and predictions are that 
the current run-up could be sustained in the sessions to come also.
    
Bank shares recovered in unison on active short-covering, notable gainers 
among them being Crescent Bank, MCB, Askari Bank, Faysal Bank and several 
others and so did leasing shares under the lead of Askari Leasing, and 
PILCORP and some others.
    
Insurance shares followed them as leading among them came in for active 
support under the lead of Adamjee, Century and Dadabhoy Insurance.
 
Some of the textile shares also recovered but in patches on news that 
export of yarn is picking up. Leading among them and those which are 
undervalued recovered sharply.
    
Synthetic shares rose broadly under the lead of leading among them on news 
that some of the leading polyester fibre producers have raised selling 
prices, which could well mean that the import might be expensive and the 
consequent slow down.

Cement and energy shares rose broadly on strong support at the current 
bottom rates, leading gainers among them being Kohat and Zeal-Pak Cement, 
Hub-Power, PSO, Shell Pakistan and some others.

Auto shares also rose on short-covering triggered by news of 15 per cent 
dividend by Indus Motors. Honda Atlas Cars and Balochistan Wheels were 
among the other good gainers.
    
Barring Parke-Davis, which fells sharply on selling apparently for 
replacement buying, most of the blue chip pharma and chemical shares 
recovered smartly under the lead of Dawood Hercules, Engro Chemicals, Fauji 
Fertiliser and ICI Pakistan and Reckitt and Colman.
    
After early weakness, PTC vouchers also joined the list of leading gainers 
and so did other blue chips including Packages and Lever Brothers.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, up Rs 1.10 on 4.050m shares 
followed by PTC vouchers, firm 65 paisa on 3.911m, ICI Pakistan (r), up one 
rupee on 1.035m, ICI Pakistan, firm 50 paisa on 0.805m, Fauji Fertiliser, 
higher Rs 1.75 on 0.641m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by NDLC, steady 30 paisa on 0.513m, 
Dewan Salman, lower 20 paisa on 0.462m, Dhan Fibre, steady paisa on 0.365m 
and Askari Leasing, higher 75 paisa on 0.235m shares.
    
"rading volume rose to 17m shares from the previous 16m shares, while 
gainers outpaced losers by 172 to 73, with 70 shares holding on to the last 
levels.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

DEAR Imran: We thought you would be different from the goons we have 
suffered and still suffer, whose followers round up people, pay them to 
go to airports to greet them and take them in processions to wherever it 
is they are going, and, in the bargain disturb the already harried people.

On the day prior to your arrival and on the day you arrived in Karachi, 
August 19, this newspaper carried advertisements exhorting citizens to go 
to the airport and give you a rousing welcome. I asked your Karachi 
lieutenant, Nazim Haji, why this was being done, and he told me that he was 
opposed to the idea but that others in your gang here had prevailed. Should 
you not curb and educate such elements?

On Saturday, when citizens of Karachi were invited to meet you, some 400 of 
us had to look at each other for over half an hour. You were late. Nazim 
made the excuse that you had been delayed by the traffic. This raised a 
laugh. It was the day after the murder of Mir Murtaza Bhutto and Karachi 
and its traffic and its people were all stunned. Then you announced that 
your late- coming was not your fault. A good leader does not keep people 
waiting, and should he do so, even inadvertently, he accepts responsibility 
and apologises.

Poor Murtaza. Poor mother Nusrat. My first reaction on hearing of his 
slaying was to grieve for my erstwhile friend, Nusrat, who chose to remain 
my friend only until she became Madame President. Bhuttos marriage to 
Nusrat opened up his entry into politics. Through her, he wormed his way 
into the favours of Iskander Mirza and his Iranian wife and from there on 
his passage up the ladder was facilitated. The unfortunate Nusrat, wife and 
mother, during her days with Bhutto suffered much public humiliation, and 
thereafter her children were to cause her boundless sorrow and grief. It is 
now to be hoped that the people she chooses to have around her will allow 
her to live in relative peace.

My second thought went to my dead friend, General Kazi Rahim, a very fine 
man and soldier, whose son, Captain Tariq Rahim, (Sandhurst 1967-69, 
awarded the Queens Cane) was killed abroad the hijacked PIA Boeing on 
Friday, March 6, 1981, whilst it was grounded at Kabul airport. He was 
identified, targeted, shot by a hijacker, and thrown out on to the tarmac 
where he bled to death. The hijacking and the murder were committed at the 
instance of the leader of the terrorist Al-Zulfikar Organisation.

At last Saturdays meeting, you handled the questions well. When you were 
asked about your manifesto, your programme, you answered that they were 
being formulated. On the subject of manifestos, promises and constitutions, 
reproduced hereunder is what is recorded in my diary after one of my 
meetings with my friend Air Marshal Asghar Khan:

Three worthwhile things he said:
Ayub Khan: The night after Ayub Khan took over, a cabinet meeting was held 
at Karachi where Asghar, as air chief was present. Ayub asked, Now that we 
have taken over, what do we do about making a constitution, having rule of 
law? Justice Munir said, No problem. I will write out a constitution of 
sorts. You publish it in the Press, then you hold four meetings  one in 
Nishtar Park, Karachi, one at Mochi Gate, Lahore, one at Chowk Yadgar, 
Peshawar, and one at Paltan Maidan, Dacca. Wave it at the crowd, tell them 
this is the constitution, read and accept it. The crowd will say manzoor 
hai, and then we can promulgate it by public acclaim. Quite legal and above 
board. The rest laughed, Ayub Khan the loudest, then saying You have to 
take the people a bit more seriously, surely.
 
Bhutto: Soon after Bhutto was released, whilst Ayub Khan was still in 
power, Bhutto and Rahim called on Asghar at his brothers house in the 
PECHS and Bhutto asked him to join the party. Asghar asked, What is you 
programme?. Bhutto said, Programme? I am good at fooling the people and I 
will fool the people. Join me and nobody will disturb us for 20 years. 
Asghar said, In that case, I will oppose you. And he did. Asghar was 
thereafter hounded, stoned, spat upon, beaten up, but never arrested and 
incarcerated. In Multan, just outside the district court, on March 21, 
1971, when action in East Pakistan was contemplated, he protested. He was 
called a Bengali agent, his hands were tied behind his back, and he was 
physically maltreated.

Benazir: I asked, after all that, why did you join Benazir? Asghars 
reply was that he thought Benazir was slightly better than her father. The 
father was cruder, this one exhibited a spark of finesse. When GIK sacked 
her in 1990, Benazir called on Asghar at his house in Islamabad and said 
GIK was going to declare her an Indian agent, an enemy of the state, etc, 
etc, and was trying to annihilate the PPP altogether. Asghar fell for this 
and sided with her. He remained with her till Nasim Hassan Shah and his 
brother judges held that Nawaz had been illegally ousted.

Go and meet Asghar. He is an honest man. You may learn from his mistakes.

As far as promises are concerned, for the time being I suggest you follow 
Jaffersons formula and simply promise the people life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. That covers it all. Also, tell the people that 
before you start tending and mending the ozone layer, you will ensure that 
they have potable water.

Your prime concentration at the moment is on corruption the eradiction of 
which in the present dispensation is unachievable. The exchanges between 
President, Prime Minister and leader of the opposition on this subject are 
reminiscent of the legendary conferences Ali Baba was wont to hold with his 
right-hand man, Mehmet Pasha, and his left-hand man, Turhan Bey, after they 
had all been on a night-long spree.

What you can do right now is what some of us are trying to do  use your 
platform to lessen the robbing of what is left in the till. One well-known 
rich picking spot upon which you can land is the Steel Mills, where figures 
of buying and selling run in billions. On December 5, 1995, an acting 
general practitioner was replaced by an acting specialist to head the mill 
and deliver. Since then we have seen a spate of large self- propagating 
newspaper advertisements which have cost us some Rs 3 crores. Each time the 
mill advertises its alleged supreme achievements (with or without a stern 
Benazir staring at us), the message that comes over loud and clear is that 
a scam has either been successfully completed or that a successful scam is 
in the making.

On July 17, 1996, wizard Vasim Jafarey wrote to the minister for 
production. His missive bearing No. F.1 (12) Advf (PM)/96 conveyed: The 
financial deterioration in the last one year has been of massive 
proportion. The main features are: 1) decline in production of 6.9%; 2) a 
massive build-up of stocks from Rs 2.3 billion to Rs 6.09 billion; 3) the 
volume of sale has declined by 23%; 4) cash balances have dwindled from Rs 
2,147 million to Rs 68 million; 5) PSM has defaulted on payments to the 
banks; 6) to conceal the grim state of affairs, a false and frivolous 
publicity campaign was undertaken; 7) PSM is demanding subsidies of over Rs 
1 billion to keep going. There is a crisis situation which needs drastic 
remedies, as we had discussed after the meeting.

But, the specialist is still at the operating table. If you are really 
after corruption, this is a good starting point.

You advocate complete openness in government doings. You are right, 
wherever the peoples money is concerned, they have the right to know how 
it is being used and misused.

A few points for you to consider. Sacrifice is a word you (or for that 
matter any politician) should never use. You are all doing precisely what 
you want to do. When you choose your team, carefully exclude those that 
claim they are willing to sacrifice themselves for their country.

And, whenever a politician proclaims he is following in Jinnahs footsteps, 
we know he is doing precisely the opposite. When regimes use Jinnahs name 
to christen projects, e.g. Jinnah Bridge at Karachis seaport and Jinnah 
"erminal at Karachis airport, you can bet your bottom dollar that massive 
corruption is involved. It is generally felt that by linking the name of 
the countrys founder a scam is somehow protected and sanctified.

Whenever you read that an action has been taken or an appointment made by 
the competent authority, presume immediately that the authority in 
question is not only highly incompetent, but also corrupt. The competent 
authority is a perfect cover, so it is imagined, to disguise the identity 
of a wrong-doer.

Your slate is still relatively clean. Good luck.

<a name="atim">A time for sorrow</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mazdak

NOW that the spontaneous outpouring of grief and anger over Murtaza 
Bhuttos senseless and brutal killing has subsided, it may be possible to 
discuss the implications of this act of violence.

It is a sad but accurate reflection on our society that it has taken the 
wanton slaying of one prime ministers brother and anothers son to bring 
into sharp focus the extent to which we have become brutalised. Years of 
escalating violence and bloodshed on our streets have immunised us from the 
pain and cruelty inflicted on tens of thousands of Pakistanis by sundry 
security agencies.

We all know the chilling implication of the words intensive interrogation 
while reading about the arrest of suspects in the newspapers, but we do not 
wish to know anything about the torture that lies behind this routine 
phrase. Similarly, we are all aware of the reality of the so-called police 
encounters, but again, ostrich-like, we pretend ignorance. Because it 
suits us to let the cops beat and torture and kill, we dont protest at 
their methods. So in a sense, we share the responsibility for the crimes 
our police and other security agencies commit every day in the name of law 
and order.

But now that we have seen the PMs brother gunned down in cold blood  
supposedly in an armed encounter with the police  we all feel we could be 
next. It is a measure of how powerful our law-enforcing agencies have 
become that they know they can now get away with the murder of the rich and 
the famous. To a great extent, our leaders have given the police a blank 
cheque in exchange for doing their dirty work, and this includes cracking 
down on the opposition whenever the need arises. Traditionally, our 
security agencies first priority is to protect the interests of the 
government of the day, and all too often, this means cowing down those 
opposed to it, usually by force.

Given the many conspiracy theories swirling around Murtaza Bhuttos killing 
and the governments low credibility, it is no surprise that nobody in the 
country is willing to believe the polices version of events. Reports of a 
major cover-up are doing the rounds, and the official position has been 
severely eroded by the Prime Ministers own statement to the effect that 
her brother was deliberately gunned down.

However, it is clear that the scene for this tragedy was set in Islamabad. 
Newspaper reports suggest that powerful individuals had sanctioned strong 
action against Murtaza Bhuttos faction of the PPP. And in the context of 
the reputation Karachis police force has acquired in the last couple of 
years, only a very naive person would expect that violence would not occur 
in a confrontation between them and Mir Murtazas armed bodyguards. It is 
significant that people driving past the Bhuttos Clifton residence earlier 
that fateful evening had noticed the presence of scores of heavily armed 
policemen.

The official line that the police did not recognise Murtaza Bhutto cannot 
be believed: at 6 2, he was an imposing figure of a man. And even if a 
credulous person swallows the polices version of the sequence of events 
until the firing took place, what is incomprehensible and unforgivable is 
that he was allowed to bleed, unconscious and unattended on the street for 
nearly an hour before he was finally taken to a nearby hospital where the 
poor man succumbed to his multiple gunshot wounds.

Conspiracy theories apart, this tragedy highlights the incompetence and 
indiscipline endemic in our police force. When you give illiterate, poorly 
paid and untrained men automatic weapons and a licence to kill, officially-
sanctioned murder and mayhem should surprise nobody. Indeed the 
governments unwritten directive to the police to shoot to kill has 
resulted in hundreds of manufactured armed encounters of the type Murtaza 
Bhutto perished in. The two common features in these bloody incidents are 
that the police hardly ever suffer any casualties, and the victims are 
usually shot from point-blank range.

One intriguing aspect of this killing is that despite the presence of so 
many officers, the trigger-happy cops could not be restrained as they went 
on a firing spree that lasted for over half an hour. But perhaps it is 
unfair to expect very high standards of our officers: many of them were 
nominated by the government for UN assignments in Bosnia last year, but 
almost every one of them flunked the English-language and driving tests.

It is a sobering thought that had Murtaza Bhutto not been accompanied by 
his armed bodyguards, he might have been alive today because the cops would 
have been less trigger-happy, and it would have been difficult to fabricate 
an armed encounter with an unarmed group. Indeed, this country is so 
awash with guns that the smallest altercation now leads to a shoot-out. The 
Interior Ministers contribution to solving this problem is to suggest that 
citizens should arm themselves to combat criminals and terrorists. He could 
have added the police to this list of potential danger. But ever since the 
arming of Pakistan began in earnest in the early eighties under Zia, 
successive governments have turned a blind eye to this dangerous trend. 
Instead of shutting down the arms bazaars of the northern areas, 
politicians flaunt armed bodyguards as a status symbol.

The political fallout of Murtaza Bhuttos killing is not easy to gauge, but 
it is likely that the PPP will have to pay a heavy price in rural Sindh in 
the next election. Although his party did not do well in 1993, he was a 
popular figure, especially among the youth. But at the national level, the 
fact that a serving prime ministers brother has been killed by the police 
signals serious political weakness. Unless the PM acts swiftly and 
decisively against those responsible for this tragedy, hers might well 
become a lame-duck administration until the next election, unless moves are 
made against her government even earlier.

It is doubly sad that a death in the family could well be a harbinger for a 
decline in Benazir Bhuttos political fortunes. But its a dog-eat-dog 
world, especially at the top. Meanwhile, I join the whole country in 
mourning the death of somebody I met only once, but Murtaza Bhutto 
impressed me with his charm, intelligence and presence. May his restless 
spirit find eternal peace, and may his star-crossed family find the courage 
to bear yet another loss.

<a name="cult">Culture of violence</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

A law of diminishing returns applies to violence, particularly if it is 
collective and impersonal violence.    In due course of time one learns to 
live with it and progressively each act of violence, whether it is murder 
of a political ally or opponent or a bomb blast, creates less of a shock 
and indeed less outrage.
    
Like people who live in crime-infested cities, be it New York or Karachi, 
people adjust their lives, mindful that there is no knowing when lightning 
will strike. But what has happened in Karachi and other cities of Pakistan 
is that this culture of violence has acquired a dignity and has become a 
status symbol. The powerful and the pretenders have devised their own 
system of justice, confident in the knowledge that they enjoy an immunity, 
the laws of the land do not apply to them. The carrying of kalashnikovs is 
a part of the dress code and these powerful and the pretenders would feel 
naked without them.
    
It is bad enough that arms should be displayed openly, it makes it both 
worse and dangerous that these arms are borne with such haughtiness. In 
other cultures they would be the equivalent of street bullies or member of 
the underworld, in our culture of violence, they are the salt of the earth. 
Bodyguards, fierce looking heavies, toting automatic weapons have become a 
part of the backdrop of the political scene. What sort of message are we 
sending to the people? Are these bodyguards meant for security purposes or 
are they ceremonial? Are they meant to reassure the people or intimidate 
them?
    
The irony is that when political murders have taken place, these bodyguards 
have proved to be singularly ineffective. They have become a part of the 
problem. Islamabad, for example, is supposed to be a weapon-free city. 
Somebody is got to be kidding. The fact is that like the rest of the 
country it is awash with weapons and it is no secret and these weapons are 
displayed brazenly, arrogantly. Many of these weapons were inherited when 
we waged a jihad in Afghanistan, on behalf of the Americans, and took what 
PTVs Khabarnama used to describe tirelessly and with grim determination as 
a principled stand.
    
We have added to this arsenal and the arms business continues to flourish. 
Attempts to disarm the country have failed miserably partly because of a 
lack of political will and partly because there has been a lack of 
comprehension of the dangers inherent in such a situation. Politics has 
become exceedingly hazardous, the pursuit of power a matter of life and 
death literally.
    
As if this was not enough, the use of violence which includes murder has 
become fashionable because there is no fear of punishment. There have been 
scores of political murders, some of them of prominent persons, and we have 
yet to see anyone arrested, leave alone convicted. Thus there is, by 
default, by omission, an unofficial sanction for a licence to kill. The 
most deplorable aspect of this culture of violence is the involvement of 
law enforcing agencies who appear to have an agenda of their own. It is not 
that they are blood-thirsty villains but they have been given a free hand 
and they have used this free hand heavily. There appears to be no 
accountability. One would imagine that these agencies are governed by some 
rules, by some conduct code and they are bound to go by these. The 
perception of the public is that minions of these agencies are not 
accountable and it would seem not accountable even to their seniors. They 
are free- lance.
    
The heart of the matter is that when someone is asked to carry out an 
illegal order, that someone then holds power over the person giving the 
order. If I ask one of my subordinates to do something dishonest, I cannot 
punish him if he chooses to do certain dishonest things off his own bat and 
for his personal gain. Sometimes things are done on the assumption that it 
will please the bosses.
    
I am sure that many of the crime committed by the Nazis were not 
specifically ordered by Hitler or the German High Command. But because 
these crimes fitted into a general pattern of repression, they were carried 
out in the belief that they would meet with the approval of the superiors. 
A law enforcing agency must not be permitted any discretion. They must be 
made to go strictly by the book. But what are we to do when crime is 
politicised and politics criminalised. It is not always easy to tell which 
is which.
    
Given the sort of political climate we live in one may be shocked by a 
political killing but one should not be surprised. Like millions of others, 
I was immensely saddened by the killing of Mir Murtaza Bhutto. My heart 
went out to his family, to his mother, his sisters, his wife and the 
children. His death has political ramifications but my grief is a private 
one. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was a close personal friend of mine and our 
friendship had nothing to do with politics. It was a friendship that went 
back to our boyhood. It is but natural that I would get to know the members 
of his family and therefore it is on this personal level that I offer my 
deepest, deepest sympathies to all members of Mir Murtazas family. God 
knows they have had their share of sorrow. I think they should be allowed 
to mourn the loss of a dear one in their own way. We can only help to wipe 
away their tears with our prayers. God be with both living and the dead.

<a name="awee">A week later</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rifaat Hamid Ghani

MURTAZA'S children have been flown to Damascus. The Prime Minister took off 
to keep her official engagements at the UN, taking her mother with her. And 
Ghinwa Murtaza Bhutto is left alone in 70 Clifton. Perhaps no one could 
share the burden of such grief.
    
The fact that Murtaza's party is rallying round her, and that those who 
mourn him come chiefly to her to express their loss  Begum Nusrat Bhutto 
having been positioned at her daughter's side to give the lie to the 
unminced expression of popular anger in home constituencies and ugly 
inferences elsewhere  may lessen Ghinwa's isolation. It may also add to 
her fears. Life has dealt Benazir Bhutto so many hard knocks without 
chastening her that it is unlikely she will find a lesson in the fact that 
the closeness of the mother she summarily dismissed as co-chairperson of 
the PPP is politically essential to her in her present crisis.
    
But a mother's love cannot whitewash Ms Bhutto's lacklustre performance as 
PM and this is now catching up with her. It caught up with the country long 
ago. She may come back with a reprieve from the IMF; she may have allayed 
some of President Leghari's misgivings. But as she herself points out, in 
democracy the mandate comes from the people.
    
Money and guns can buy a mandate up to a point, even convert it, or mask 
and obstruct the conversion. But with Murtaza Bhutto's killing it has all 
got out of hand. Money and guns and state power have turned upon 
themselves, and very publicly. The deficiencies in the police are already 
exposed. If judicial process is found wanting by the people that too will 
be exposed. And the Prime Minister is exposed as an individual who, even in 
the deepest personal grief, is primarily concerned with the retention of 
power. Whether in recourse to unbecomingly emotive oratory to recapture 
public sympathy or calculating the next move.
    
It was in rather poor taste for Mr Leghari to file his reference in the 
Supreme Court on Saturday the twenty-first. It was equally unedifying to 
watch Ms Bhutto playing to the gallery when receiving the masses' 
condolences the next day. That performance was capped by or docile 
assumption of deference towards the President in her meeting with him on 
the twenty- eighth.
    
Sial's not that mysterious death has lent credence to the belief that dark 
and powerful forces are at work  forces from within and above. Hardly 
anyone attributes the hideous act to an outside force. That much self-
knowledge we seem to have gained.
    
If one picks the agencies as culprits, the next question is: agencies with 
personnel gone rogue or agencies doing insidious biddings at times. The 
multiplicity of agencies, and the strange pattern of authority that has 
been established  some official sources, some semi-official ones possibly 
even more authoritative  compound the difficulties of finding an answer. 
Democratisation and secret intelligence agencies focusing on internal 
political activities do not go together. The combination can produce the 
kind of situation that has given us the Murtaza catastrophe and the 
horrendous enforcement of law and order with a view to eliminating 
political dissent and challenges that we see in Karachi.
    
What more could be said about the correlation between the administration 
and the people than this: the whole nation is traumatised, but the 
provincial government doesn't even twitch. When the Sindh cabinet met on 
the twenty-ninth it passed, in appropriate decorum, a condolence 
resolution. And the Governor is quoted as saying when addressing the Joint 
Services Staff College and delivering a lecture on Karachi: problems and 
prospects, "We have broken the vicious circle. Peace has been substantially 
restored." But the real gem is "the morale of police and law enforcement 
agencies is high." quite right, Mr Governor. It's the citizens' morale 
that's sunk.

<a name="wome">Women on the world stage</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto

IT'S ironic that though the women's liberation movement took birth in 
America and Europe, more Asian females have reached the pinnacle of 
political power.
    
Some are quick to explain this phenomenon as a result of family tragedies 
and the clout the slain male relative wielded. Leaders like India's Indira 
Gandhi, Sri Lanka's Sirimavo Bandaranaike and me, for instance, have been 
wives or daughters of prime ministers.
    
But this argument underestimates the challenges we have faced  and 
overcome. No doubt, we did have a head start. As relatives of popular 
leaders, we had name recognition and were seen as symbols of the values 
that our near and dear ones held. Many saw us as "consensus" figures or 
rallying points in times of uncertainty.
    
But there is also no denying that we have succeeded on our own strengths. 
We had to emerge as leaders in our own right, convincing our supporters and 
people in our countries of our ability to organise, motivate, manage and 
lead. We by no means enjoyed a free ride.
    
Emotion and sentiment are not enough to catapult one to the top of the 
political ladder. It takes determination, perseverance, hardship and the 
ability to defy physical threat to do so. It also takes a plan and the 
ability to make that vision understood by the people.
    
All this and more is necessary because, as women leaders, we are often 
faced with vilification and personal attacks during campaigns. And all 
leaders have to find the reserve of strength that helps them make it 
through the often torturous days.
    
For me, I found that strength in the unwillingness to let my countrymen and 
my father down. My father had always had such confidence in me, and that 
confidence proved to be a driving force that kept me from wavering, even in 
the most terrifying moments. Had I wavered, I could not have succeeded.
    
Yet even when a woman has reached the height of her career, she still faces 
discrimination. Margaret Thatcher, for example, was known as "the only man" 
in her cabinet. To me, this seems to be both derogatory and sexist, as her 
gender was irrelevant to her achievements.
    
A former prime minister of France, Edith Cresson, once observed: "What I 
find amazing is that when a man is designated as prime minister, nobody 
asks if they think it is a good thing that he is a man."
    
I can only agree. There is no doubt that Thatcher was an exceptional 
leader, but so were many men  and it had nothing to do with their sex and 
everything to do with personal traits and leadership qualities.
    
Having said this, I do think that there are certain characteristics that 
women have which make them more effective leaders than men. For instance, 
they have greater compassion and a sense of nurturing. I may be wrong, but 
I believe women are not as hard or ruthless as men. And issues concerning 
mother and child receive greater attention from female leaders.
    
When asked how men and women leaders differ, Mrs Bandaranaike (the world's 
first female prime minister) answered, "Probably women deal with things a 
little more humanely. Men are tough and impatient."
    
Certainly, I am very conscious of being a women and of my responsibility to 
other women, both inside and outside Pakistan. I share a sense of 
sisterhood with working woman I have never met. I imagine them juggling 
jobs and family and empathise with them. In Muslim countries like Pakistan 
and Bangladesh, where women were marginalised because of a narrow 
interpretation of Islam, this understanding is of particular relevance. 
Women such as myself have a special responsibility to strive to uphold the 
spirit of Islam as an egalitarian religion, safeguarding the rights of 
women.
    
Fortunately, the empowerment of women has become a global priority. As time 
passes, the effectiveness of women in decision- making and the amount of 
control we have over our lives and destinies have increased.
    
I believe that the women leaders of today combine both the toughness of men 
and the humaneness of women, which is the essence of a balanced individual 
and an effective leader. It is this balance that is most important  for 
men and women both.Copyright 1996 Dawn-Creators Syndicate, Inc.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="quad">Quadrangular a tough event, says Akram</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Sept 26: Pakistan captain Wasim Akram once again advised the 
followers of the game not to be complacent in the forthcoming quadrangular 
tournament in Kenya. "It's a different tournament with different teams 
playing. The time is also not the same, the skipper said.  "One-day 
cricket is a funny game," he added.

Akram, before his departure, said the quadrangular tournament will be a 
tough one in the background that three of his `fighters were not with the 
team. "I think it is an inexperienced but gutsy team. But I must admit that 
in cricket, experience counts a lot. But I am optimistic as I should be," 
Akram said.  Akram stressed that despite the handicaps of the team, the 
morale of his players was high. "It is altogether a very different outfit. 
"here is more team spirit, understanding and co-ordination between the 
members of the side. As a captain, I feel that if his players are 
determined and ambitious, things are different in any gruelling or tough 
series."

The skipper felt that if one has to see the significant change in the team, 
only the fielding aspect can be examined closely. We were a better 
fielding side than India. Fielding has always been our weak point but with 
the dedication and interest of the players, it improved progressively.

Akram, on the prospects of the Kenyan tournament, felt that as captain he 
would like nothing but to win it. But the reality is that we will be 
without three experienced players who can make a lot of difference. Sri 
Lanka and South Africa are no push-overs nor is Kenya who dismissed the 
West Indies for 93 in the World Cup. I must say that not many teams have 
been able to restrict the West Indian to under 100 runs, said Akram.

Asked if the victory in Canada had erased the memories of defeat in the 
World Cup, Akram said: It has minimised the pain and grief, but the defeat 
at World Cup quarter-final cannot be compensated by victories in other 
events. It can only be balanced by victory in the same competition and for 
that we have to wait till 1999.

<a name="team">Team leaves for Kenya with alterations</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Sept 26: The Pakistan cricket team left  for Kenya to take part in 
the quadrangular tournament with last-minute alterations in the squad. 
Vice-captain Aamir Sohail pulled out from the tour and in a surprise move, 
the two-member Selection Committee, headed by Salim Altaf, named Ramiz Raja 
and Saeed Azad to complete the makeup of the team.

The Selection Committee, on Tuesday, had named 19-year-old Shahid Khan 
Afridi as a replacement for Mushtaq Ahmad who was forced to withdraw from 
the Kenyan trip because of knee operation. Afridi arrived in the early 
hours of Thursday from the West Indies and immediately took the Kenyan 
Airways flight which left for Nairobi along with other 12 members of the 
team including cricket manager, Mushtaq Mohammad at 7:55 a.m. No 
replacement was, however, named for Inzamamul Haq who had expressed his 
inability to tour Kenya because of knee surgery. 

Saeed Azad, a prolific domestic scorer, will leave for Kenya on Friday 
morning by Emirates Airlines. He was informed about his selection on 
"hursday morning.  I am stunned. It is the greatest news I have heard for 
a long time, a jubilant Saeed Azad said. I am looking forward to the 
competition and cement my place in the Pakistan cricket team. I know the 
competition is tough but I am confident of my potential and ability. If I 
need a little luck, it is this time, Azad, 27, said.

Saeed, who played a one-day international against Sri Lanka at Rawalpindi 
11 months ago and scored 19 runs, earned the selectors nod after he scored 
613 from 12 first-class innings. However, Ramiz Raja's inclusion has 
surprised all and sundry and seems to be a contradiction of the highly 
publicised current policy of the selectors who emphasise that they want to 
raise a team for the 1999 World Cup. It is anybodys guess that how more 
the 34-year-old Raja will serve the country.

Raja, a veteran of 170 one-day games and scorer of 5,257, last played a 
one-day game for Pakistan at Sharjah in April this year. He also played in 
Singapore and from seven games failed to cross 100 runs. With Saeed Anwar, 
Salim Elahi and Shadab Kabir (all openers) in the Kenya-bound team, the 
selectors would have been wise if they had strengthened the suspect middle-
order. The name of Sohail Jaffar, a scorer of over 1,400 runs last season, 
immediately springs to mind who is suffering from a raw deal from the 
selectors.

According to official sources, the names of Basit Ali and Rashid Latif were 
circulating at the airport before the departure of the team. However, the 
selectors preferred Saeed and especially Ramiz, for reasons yet unknown. 
The team, which left for Kenya, is: Wasim Akram (captain), Shadab Kabir, 
Saeed Anwar, Salim Elahi, Salim Malik, Ijaz Ahmad, Waqar Younis, Shahid 
Nazir, Saqlain Mushtaq, Azhar Mahmood, Shahid Khan Afridi and Moin Khan.

NAIROBI, Sept 20: In a most unfortunate development, captain Wasim Akram 
had to leave for Karachi on Monday (Sept 30) afternoon on way to Lahore to 
be on the bedside of his father, Chaudhry Muhammad Akram, who is struggling 
for life after a serious heart attack a couple of days ago.
    
Tour Manager Nusrat Azeem told this correspondent here on Monday evening 
that the sad news of the precarious condition of Wasim Akram's father 
reached Kenya on Sunday during the match against South Africa. All 
necessary arrangements to book Wasim Akram on Kenyan Airlines flight which 
left Nairobi on Monday at 6-45 p.m. (Kenyan standard time) had to be made 
in and emergency and the Pakistan skipper left the team in the midst of the 
tournament for reasons beyond any one's control.

This correspondent contacted Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chief Executive 
Majid Khan at his residence on Monday evening on telephone. Majid said in 
consultation with the selection committee, the PCB has decided to send the 
PIA paceman Mohammad Zahid as a replacement for Wasim Akram to Kenya by the 
Kenyan Airlines flight on Tuesday. He said he should be reaching Nairobi by 
Tuesday evening and would join the team.

While replying to a question, Majid Khan said that Wasim's father, Chaudhry 
Mohammad Akram had a severe stroke in Lahore a few days ago. He had to be 
taken to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of Ittefaq Hospital. Since his 
condition did not improve, he had been shifted to the ICU of Punjab 
Institute of Cardiology. His condition was stated to be serious.

While replying to a question, Nusrat Azeem said opener Saeed Anwar would be 
taking over the captaincy of the Pakistan team in the absence of Wasim 
Akram. He said that this sudden development had sent a pall of gloom among 
the Pakistani team-members who had been praying for an early recovery of 
Chaudhry Akram.

Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 30: The Chairman of the National Selection Committee, Salim 
Altaf, on Monday evening strongly dismissed the impression that the 
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has instructed his panel not to consider a few 
cricketers.
    
"It is absolutely untrue. The PCB has not issued any such directives. We 
are an independent body," Altaf said from his Lahore residence.
    
"We have not discarded any cricketer. We have an open mind and we will try 
to give every possible chance to all the deserving candidates," the former 
"est pacer stressed.
    
Asked if that was so, why did the selection Committee twice spurned the 
touring management's request of Rashid Latif. "You see the tour Selection 
Committee can make a request, it is up to the selectors in Pakistan to 
decide who should beef up the side in case of emergency.
    
"I had a long chat with Mushtaq Mohammad (cricket manager) and he 
understands," Altaf added.
    
On the non-inclusion of experienced pacer Aqib Javed for Wasim Akram, who 
is rushing back to Lahore to nurse his ailing father, Salim Altaf was of 
the view that the Kenyan trip was now a short tour.
    
"Only two matches are left and our main match is against Sri Lanka. If we 
lose to the world champions, we are out of the tournament. Otherwise, we 
get an additional match.
    
"Taking this into account, we decided that instead of Aqib, we should send 
Mohammad Zahid who is immensely promising. Zahid will get the exposure and 
in years to come, the investment on him will return.
    
"As far as Aqib (Javed) is concerned, it should not be the end of the world 
for him. He is still very much in our minds and we are evaluating each and 
every performance," Altaf stated.

LONDON, Sept 27: Keeping into consideration the West Indies Cricket Boards 
plan to pay lucrative sums to their players and sign them to stay in West 
Indies and play full season, Northamptonshire has signed young Pakistan 
fast bowler Mohammad Akram for the 1997 summer to replace Curtly Ambrose.

Akram was invited to the county this week for negotiations and has been 
given a one-year contract with the promise that if he does well he could 
return even in 1998. With Pakistans thumping victory in the series against 
England in the summer of 1996, players like Saeed Anwar, Inzamamul Haq and 
Saqlain Mushtaq were strongly tipped to gain a county place. There was a 
lot of interest shown in Saqlain and Surrey is reported to have an interest 
in the youngster.

Wasim Akram will be back to his old county Lancashire and so would Waqar 
Younis for Glamorgan on a contract of near 170,000 pounds spread over two 
years and Mushtaq, the destroyer of England batting, will be here to 
playing for Somerset on a 100,000 pound deal.

Mohammad Akram showed a lot of promise here in Bristol while playing in 
league in 1995 and nearly made it for Gloucestershire when Courtney Walsh 
was away. His impressive 7 for 51 in Pakistans win against Leicestershire 
this summer got several counties interested in him, including Surrey. There 
was not much of an opportunity for him during the summer with Wasim, Waqar 
and Mushtaq taking wickets but still managing to finish with 14 wickets at 
an average of 33.78 in six matches, including a wicket in the only Test he 
played in the series.

With the possibility of the domestic competition stretching up to the month 
of June next year in the Caribbean, the counties are worried and have 
already started to review their arrangements with the West Indian players. 
The West Indies is already planning to contract their players for the whole 
year and compensate their loss of earning through counties by having 
sponsorships. The purpose behind the boards proposal is the upkeep and 
fitness of the players, especially the fast bowlers.

Courtney Walsh, like Ambrose, has agreed only verbally to his county, 
Gloucestershire, in case he had to sign with his board. In six seasons and 
in 78 first class matches Ambrose took 318 wickets for Northamptonshire at 
21 apiece. If Mohammad Akram keeps fit and does well on the county circuit 
he may become an asset not only for the county but for his country for some 
time to come.
