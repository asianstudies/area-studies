ISLAMABAD, May 23: A delegation from Amnesty International Secretariat on 
expressed shock at the complacency with which government ministers and 
officials acknowledged that torture is a fact of life in Pakistan.
    
The delegation which has completed a round of talks with federal ministers, 
senior officials, parliamentarians and legal experts on the organisations 
human rights concerns in Pakistan, regretted that Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto was unable to find time to receive them, in view of her stated 
commitment to human rights organisation.
    
The delegation noted the many positive statements the Pakistan government 
has made internationally about its commitment to improve human rights in 
the country. However, the delegation found that rhetoric was not matched by 
the reality on the ground.
    
In its submission to the government, the delegation documented instances of 
torture, rape and deaths in police custody across the country. It also 
raised concerns about extra-judicial killings which continue throughout the 
country.
    
The delegation recognised that the government is making some genuine 
efforts to improve laws and strengthen safeguards with a view to curbing 
human rights violations. These include the ratification of the Convention 
for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, the partial abolition 
of flogging and the proposed abolition of the death penalty for children 
under 16.
    
Amnesty International delegation provided government ministers with details 
of 127 extra-judicial executions and deaths in custody recorded in the 
period from January 1995 to the present. It welcomed the governments 
promise to provide written comments on the status of investigations into 
each and every case.
    
It noted, however, that Amnesty International had received responses on 
only seven of 120 such cases it had raised with the government last year, 
most of which had been unconvincing and unsatisfactory.
    
The delegation detected few signs of any sincere political will to tackle 
these pernicious and widespread problems at their roots- the impunity of 
offenders.

FAISALABAD, May 29: Thirteen passengers were killed and 27 suffered 
injuries when a bus collided head-on with a coach on the Faisalabad-
Sheikhupura road, about 35 km from here.
 
A bus of the Kohistan company had left Faisalabad for Rawalpindi at about 
10.00pm. When it reached near the Sitara Spinning Mills, it collided with a 
flying coach of the Nadir Company which was coming from Lahore. The 
vehicles were totally smashed. Bodies of the passengers could be recovered 
after cutting the seats.
 
Eleven passengers died on the spot while two others succumbed to their 
injuries on way to hospital.
 
Eyewitnesses told Dawn the accident took place due to overtaking.

<a name="onek">One killed in Lahore GPO bomb explosion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

LAHORE, May 26: An employee of the Pakistan Postal Services Service 
Corporation was killed and two other employees injured when a powerful bomb 
exploded in the union office of the main Cantonment Post Office here on 
Sunday morning.
    
The blast was so intense that the roofs of three adjoining rooms collapsed 
while the window panes of some other rooms in the building were broken.
    
There was complete panic among the employees who had turned up for work 
shortly before the explosion took place at around 9am. The toll would have 
been higher if the bomb had gone off later because not all workers had 
reported for duty by then.
    
Police are not outright blaming terrorism for the explosion. They suspect 
that it could be linked to the ongoing rift between the PPSC management and 
leaders of the National Organisation of Postal Employees (NOPE). From the 
initial investigations, it seems to be the work of some union men involved 
in the multi-million scandal of fake stamps, a high official of Cantonment 
police told Dawn. However, no arrest had been made till late in the 
evening.
    
Sundays blast at the post office is the seventh incident of its kind in or 
around Lahore in the past two months. As many as six people were killed and 
over 30 injured in the bomb blast at the outpatients department of the 
Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital on April 15. This was followed by 
bus blasts at Bhai Pheru and Sheikhupura which together killed 49 people. 
There were smaller explosions at the American Centre, Lahore Television 
Station and a Kahna Imam Bargah which involved no casualties.
    
A bomb expert told Dawn on Sunday night initial examination of the pieces 
collected from the debris indicate that the device was a highly explosive 
time-bomb weighing about two kg.

<a name="usme">US media term occupied Kashmir elections sham, fake</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, May 24: The US media on Friday almost unanimously reported that 
the elections held in Indian-occupied Kashmir were a sham, fake and a 
parody of democracy with heavily armed Indian troops forcing people out of 
their houses to go and vote.
    
The Washington Post put the elections story as its lead in the World News 
section showing pictures of Kashmiri women shouting anti-India slogans and 
a convoy of troops passing by a line of voters in village Awantipora in 
northern Kashmir.
    
The headlines of the Post, Washington Times, New York Times and the Los 
Angeles Times screamed against the use of force by the troops as special 
correspondents of these newspapers reported their experiences from various 
parts of the occupied valley.
    
Troops in Kashmir force people to vote said the Washington Post headline. 
Kashmiris forcibly taken to polls in India noted the Washington Times. 
The Los Angeles Times said: Voters In Muslim Areas Say They Are Forced to 
Vote, while the New York Times used the headline: Indian troops used in 
Kashmir, some say to force Muslims to vote. John-Thor Dahlburg of the Los 
Angeles Times began his report from New Delhi saying: In an exercise 
denounced by many as a parody of democracy, voters in predominantly Muslim 
areas of the troubled Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir were called to 
the polls Thursday for the first elections in seven years.
    
Witnesses told reporters that crowds in at least one town charged polling 
booths, complaining that security forces were trying to force people into 
voting...
    
John F. Burns of the New York Times, reporting from Baramula in Kashmir 
said: Indian troops moved into villages and urban neighbourhoods across 
the Vale of Kashmir at dawn on Thursday, rousing Muslims from their beds to 
vote in the first election to be held in the only Indian state with a 
Muslim majority since a Muslim separatist rebellion began in 1989.
    
By holding voting for the six seats in Parliament allotted to Kashmir, the 
Indian government aimed to show that a large fighting force has beaten back 
the insurgency.
    
But after a day marked by widespread allegations that tens of thousands of 
troops were deployed to force Muslims to vote at gunpoint, the message that 
India wanted to send to the world appeared likely to be lost, or at least 
heavily muffled.
    
Azadi! the crowds shouted, meaning freedom in Urdu, the language spoken 
by most Kashmiri Muslims. India get out!

<a name="deal">Deal signed with France for subs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, May 23: Pakistan and France have signed a deal for three 
improved AGOSTA-90 B submarines with better sensor and weapon 
configuration, Defence Minister Aftab Shaban Mirani said.
    
He said the first submarine is being completely constructed in France.
    
The hull sections of the second submarine will be constructed in France, he 
said, which will then be assembled and outfitted in Pakistan.
    
The third submarine, he said, will be completely constructed in Pakistan.
    
He said France will also provide materials, technology and extensive 
training to our technicians.
    
To a query from Rao Qaiser Ali Khan of Okara, he said the work on the 
manufacture of Mushahak and Karakoram-8 aircraft is progressing smoothly.
    
He said till now 258 Mushahak aircraft have been produced and delivered.
    
At present, he said there are 20 aircraft in different stages of parts 
production, assembly and final assembly.
    
Moreover, he said tooling for manufacturing sub-assembles of K-8 aircraft 
is being fabricated presently, after which parts fabrication and assembly 
phases will commence during November, 1996.

LONDON, May 25: After a weeks stay in the UK, Imran Khan is returning to 
Pakistan on Sunday to resume the work of his party, the Tehreek-e-Insaf.
  
He introduced the movement for reform, that he has initiated, to Pakistanis 
resident in the United Kingdom at a public gathering in London, when he 
explained his ten-point programme with a view to launching a political 
party after completing preparatory work.

The Tehreek-e-Insaf founder was interviewed for British television. Last 
night in an interview with Sky television he was asked if he wanted to be 
prime minister of Pakistan. 
  
He replied: political power is the only way to bring about reform, so 
yes.

<a name="edhi">Edhi threatens to surrender nationality</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 23: Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi and his wife Bilquis Edhi faced 
an embarrassment when they were told that they also needed a police inquiry 
to obtain fresh passports.
    
The incident was shocking for Edhi who threatened later in the night that 
if the government insisted on a police enquiry, he would surrender his 
nationality.
    
I will wait for two days. After that I will go to Islamabad and surrender 
my nationality at a Press conference. I will then appeal to other countries 
to give me their nationality. I have been working for the people for the 
last 48 years but I feel our entire efforts for social work are going down 
the drain, he told Dawn.
    
The couple, whose passports expired this year, reached the Passport Office 
in Saddar in the morning and applied for the issuance of emergency 
passports.
    
In the afternoon, Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi was told that he and his wife 
could not get fresh passports as both of them need police enquiries.
    
Edhi criticised the Directorate of Passports and alleged that outside their 
own office, agents charged Rs 500 per passport to help anyone requiring a 
police enquiry but the Passport Office never took notice of it.

<a name="govt">Govt orders issuance of passports to Edhis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 24: A senior official of the Federal Investigation Agency said 
that the government has ordered the Passport Office to immediately issue 
passports to Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi and his wife Bilquis Edhi.

Wasim Ahmed, the immigration chief in Karachi, said that the interior 
ministry had suspended director of passports Saeeda Baloch who had 
allegedly misbehaved with the Edhis.

THREATS: Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi received four threatening telephone 
calls at his Mithadar Offices on Friday evening.
    
The callers, who identified themselves as from the police, claimed that 
they had intercepted his ambulances which were allegedly carrying arms.
    
I received the first call at 6pm. This was followed by three other calls 
in which the callers hurled threats and said they would fix me. It seems it 
is a follow-up to what happened to me and my wife at the Passport Office in 
Saddar on Thursday, Edhi said.
    
After receiving these threatening calls I decided to suspend our ambulance 
service for a night but later I thought otherwise as the suspension would 
hit at least 100 to 125 patients in Karachi alone, he said.

<a name="fres">Freshwater turtles under threat</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr A.A. Quraishy

KARACHI, May 23:  A shortage of government funds has made it impossible to 
carry out a much-needed population density survey of freshwater turtles, 
the director of the Zoological Survey of Pakistan Dr Farooq Ahmed said.

We know that are not prolific and face the threat of extinction. They 
cannot be allowed to be exported for any purpose, he told Dawn.
    
Recent news reports have suggested that some people have asked the Commerce 
Ministry to allow export of freshwater turtles from so-called turtle farms 
Gujranwala in Sialkot, Gujranwala and Gujrat.
    
Breeding freshwater turtles in captivity is a complex and little understood 
phenomenon, yet many people claim that they can be commercially farmed.
    
There are, however, no turtle farms anywhere in Pakistan. The obvious 
alternative then will be to catch them from freshwater lakes, pools and 
canals where they serve a useful role in stabilising the the ecosystem by 
eating dead fish at the bottom of lakes and pools.

<a name="laho">Lahore to be a mega-city in 4 years</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

LAHORE, May 25: The city of Lahore, growing unchecked at 3 per cent 
annually, will be a mega-city in next four years, and by the year 2015 will 
be among the worlds largest cities with a population of about 11 million, 
according to the United Nations report for 1995-96. The citys present 
population is estimated at about 6.5 million.
  
Karachi is already among the 30 largest cities of the world. These, with 
their population (in millions), are: Tokyo (26.5), New York (16), Mexico 
City (14.6), Sao Paulo in Brazil (14.4), Shanghai (12.8), Mumbai (12.1), 
Los Angeles (11.8), Beijing (11), Calcutta (10.9), Buenos Aires in 
Argentina and Seoul in South Korea (10.8), Osaka in Japan (10.7), Rio de 
Janeiro in Brazil (9.8), Paris, Tianjin (China) and Jakarta (9), Moscow 
(8.5), Cairo (8.2), Delhi (8.1), Manila and Karachi (8), Lagos (7.9), 
London (7.6), Chicago (7), Istanbul, Lima (Peru), Essen (Germany) and 
Tehran (6.4) and Bangkok and Dhaka (6).
  
The UN report points out that the worlds population is increasing at an 
average rate of 1.5 per cent annually  an addition of 89 million people a 
year  and is expected to go past 8.29 billion by the year 2025, compared 
to 5.8 billion at present.
  
Pakistan, with its population of 144.5 million, is at present the seventh 
largest country. With a growth rate of 2.6 per cent, it will be the fourth 
in the world by 2025 overtaking Indonesia, Brazil and the Russian 
Federation. China will remain number one with India and the US behind.
  
The report predicts that the order of the largest cities will be changed by 
2015. According to the UN list, Tokyo will remain the largest city, 
followed by Mumbai, Lagos, Shanghai, Jakarta, Sao Paulo, Karachi, Beijing, 
Dhaka, Mexico City, New York, Calcutta, Delhi, Tianjin, Manila, Cairo, Los 
Angeles, Seoul, Buenos Aires, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Lahore, Hyderabad

<a name="caas">CAAs satellite radar system to be launched soon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 23: A Rs 8 billion integrated satellite- backed radar system 
of the Civil Aviation Authority is in its final stage of testing, ready to 
be launched within the next two months.
    
After commissioning, the new system will introduce Pakistan as the only 
country in the region which could provide radar coverage not only to its 
own airspace but also to that of neighbouring countries.
    
The Director General of CAA, Mr Khalil Ahmed, said that after the 
introduction of satellite-backed radar system, Pakistans airspace would 
witness a massive growth of traffic.
    
The CAA, he said, would soon approach the International Civil Aviation 
Organisation to redefine the countrys airspace corridors to facilitate all 
the aircraft using Pakistans airspace.
    
At the moment, in the absence of any satellite radar system, most of the 
aircraft overflying Pakistan follow zigzag routes. But, with the new 
system, several of such zigzag routes will be changed, Mr Ahmed said.
    
He opined that at least 40 per cent of the present air routes would be 
changed, which could result in the saving of at least 15 per cent fuel by 
the aircraft.
    
However, the CAA chief said that during talks with ICAO, the CAA would also 
propose an increase in its navigational services charges.
    
The present radar system enables the CAA to assist only those aircraft 
which come within the radius of 100 to 125 nautical miles from its radars. 
But the satellite system will enable Pakistan navigators to direct and 
assist an aircraft as soon as it enters Pakistans airspace, he said.
    
Mr Ahmed said Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad would be the main radar and VHF 
communications centres, connected via satellite with Pasni, Quetta, 
Rajanpur, Faisalabad and Hyderabad.
    
The system, he said, would also enable Pakistan to provide up-to-date 
flight information to regional airports.

<a name="econ">Economic data on Internet from June 1</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report
    
ISLAMABAD, May 24: Pakistans quarterly economic data regarding inflation, 
trade deficit, current account deficit, investment trends, selected 
corporate news, stock market fluctuations, etc., will be available on the 
Internet from June 1.
    
The Board of Investment (BoI) has finalised arrangements to link the 
quarterly information on Pakistan economy with Euromoney global data. The 
BoI will be responsible for updating the information every three months.
    
Despite frequent commitments and promises, the government has so far failed 
to keep the Pakistan embassies, especially the commercial counsellors, well 
equipped with periodic supply of published information on latest economic 
trends in the country, rendering it almost impossible for Pakistani envoys 
to make a convincing sales pitch while trying to whet the appetite of 
prospective foreign investors in Pakistan.
    
Launching of the proposed quarterly economic information bulletin on the 
Internet is expected to fulfil a badly felt need of the prospective foreign 
investors interested in exploring investment potential in Pakistan and also 
add a new dynamism to the on-going efforts to attract an accelerated flow 
of foreign private investment in the country.

<a name="imfl">IMF links loan to GST, farm tax</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 23: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) eventually came 
down heavily on the government for being lax on the reform agenda and 
demanded lowering of the budget deficit, removing various kinds of tax 
exemptions, levying GST up to manufacturing stage across the board and 
introducing agriculture tax.
    
We are not dictating terms but Pakistan would have to follow certain 
financial discipline by introducing modern tax system, said the head of 
the visiting IMF mission Mr. Paul Schabrier while speaking at a Press 
conference after the conclusion of week long pre-budget negotiations with 
the representatives of the government of Pakistan. Prime Ministers Advisor 
on Finance, Economic Affairs V.A. Jaffarey was also present.
    
The IMF official categorically stated that there was no question of 
offering third tranche of 68.5 million dollars out of a 600 million standby 
loan without first reviewing Pakistans budgetary proposals for 1996-97.
    
Our mission will come here again after the budget and only then it will be 
decided whether or not to disburse the third tranche. he added.
    
Unlike Mohammad Al-Erian, Country Director of the IMF who visited Pakistan 
three months ago, Mr. Paul did not give a clean bill of health to the 
Pakistani economy. He was rather too forthcoming in suggesting that 
Pakistan did not have a transparent and a predictable tax regime, an aspect 
which needed special attention of the government to achieve structural 
reforms programme.
    
Answering a question, he said the foremost important thing was the 
documentation of the economy through the imposition of the General Sales 
Tax (GST) which could be introduced initially on all items up to the import 
level. Later it could be extended at the manufacturing and retail stages. 
We are not immediately proposing GST on retail level which could be 
collected in a phased manner, he clarified.
    
He told another questioner that the reduction in the overall budget deficit 
will not only lower inflation but would also improve the overall economy of 
the country.

<a name="budg">Budget planners face uphill task in cutting deficit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, May 25: The ever-widening budget deficit, now said to have 
reached to over Rs130 billion, is one of the major impediments confronting 
the planners to propose minimum taxes for 1996-97.
  
Informed sources said that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has expressed 
serious concern over the current narrow tax base and has called for 
increasing the revenue with a view to reduce the huge deficit.
  
She has asked her key economic mangers to find out a group of honest 
Income Tax and Customs officers to ensure substantial increase in the 
present weak revenue collection system.
  
Sources said the Prime Minister endorsed the IMF view that Pakistan needs a 
modern tax system to help resolve its growing financial problems.
  
Initial exercises conducted by the concerned officials, sources said, have 
proposed the overall size of the next budget at Rs470 billion, including 
Rs30 billion fresh taxes, as compared to Rs431 billion of the current year.
  
However, the biggest problem the planners face is how to reduce the 
budgetary deficit, especially after the IMF demand of bringing it to 4 per 
cent of the GDP and linking the issue with future lending.
  
Once again, sources said, the planners are banking on the Central Board of 
Revenue (CBR) to collect more taxes and avoid offering what is termed as 
doctored figures about which the Auditor-General is also said to have 
expressed his concern.

<a name="mayc">Budget may contain Rs26bn new taxes</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haq

ISLAMABAD, May 26: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto here on Sunday presided 
over a meeting which discussed budgetary proposals for 1996-97 and was told 
that the government would have to impose minimum taxes of Rs26 billion to 
achieve 4 per cent GDP budget deficit target as prescribed by the IMF.
    
Dawn learnt that adviser to the prime minister on finance V.A. Jafarey and 
minister of state for finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin briefed Ms Bhutto about 
the economic situation with special reference to levying fresh taxes in the 
budget.
    
About the new taxes, Mr Jafarey said the government needed additional Rs87 
billion to fund the new budget, estimated to cost Rs470 billion covering 
the difference of 7 per cent devaluation, as well as the usual 10 per cent 
increase in the budget.
    
Informed sources said the weak kitty position was discussed threadbare with 
Ms Bhutto saying the time has come that provinces generate their own 
resources and stop depending on the federal government.  She said that 
since NFC has not decided about the shares of the provinces from the 
divisible pool, they would get funds according to the previous NFC Award.
    
Now the provinces were being asked to widen their tax base to meet their 
financial demands. The provinces, ministries and divisions will no more be 
receiving additional and supplementary grants in future, said an official.
    
Sources said that out of total expected capital outlay of about Rs470 
billion, around 10 per cent increase was being given to the armed forces to 
get Rs130 billion in 1996-97 compared to Rs116 billion in the current year. 
   
Sources said Rs135 billion go into debt servicing, while Rs9 billion will 
be allocated for Ghazi Barotha. Last year, the government had allocated 
Rs12 billion for the 1400 MW hydel power project.
    
Mass transit systems for Karachi and Lahore will get Rs3 billion. National 
Highway Authority will be provided Rs12 billion against its demand of Rs17 
billion while it was offered Rs11 billion for the current year.

<a name="wind">Window-dressing to conceal reckless borrowing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

Having no more than an undergraduate understanding of modern day economics 
and lacking in political experience as well, Shahid Hasan Khan and company, 
the team which was assigned the job of making the 1995-96 budget was not 
expected to propose anything other than abandoning the reform path, which 
they did in seemingly sheer panic.
    
As was expected the economy, as a result, all but collapsed within a matter 
of three months.
    
The pieces were picked up subsequently by Vasim Jafarey and company, the 
team well-versed in the Ishaqian tactics of creating dream-like illusions 
out of a nightmarish situation.
    
The first thing which this team did was to entrap the country further in 
the clutches of IMF and World Bank for a paltry amount of $ 600 million. 
Next, it proceeded to create the illusion of meeting the budgetary deficit 
target while the government went on breaking all previous records of 
borrowing for budgetary support.
    
The method is simple: Let the political government indulge in all kinds of 
profligacy during a quarter, fudge the figures at the end of each with 
window- dressing and creative accounting to show that the bank borrowing 
limit for budgetary support for the quarter has been achieved and then let 
things go back to normal as soon as the next quarter started.
    
This happened at the end of the second quarter when the government claimed 
that the budgetary borrowing which had remained hovering around Rs 55 
billion during the six months ending December 31, 1995, had been brought 
down to Rs 40 billion, the limit imposed by the IMF for the first half of 
the fiscal year against the whole year target of Rs 29.1 billion.
    
But as soon as the next quarter commenced, things returned to their 
nightmarish normal with the borrowing jumping beyond Rs 70 billion within 
four weeks. But at the end of the quarter, that is on and around March 31, 
1996, enough resources had been temporarily parked with the State Bank to 
bring the borrowing figure down to Rs 32 billion, the IMF limit for the 
first nine months.
    
Most likely the government is expected to repeat the performance on June 
30, 1996 and show that it has achieved the whole year target for bank 
borrowing for budgetary support of Rs 29.1 billion. Already it has promised 
the businessmen to issue post-dated cheques of over Rs 8 billion for the 
first week of July, 1996 against its current years duty drawback 
obligations.
    
In Ghulam Ishaq Khans days, this kind of window-dressing and creative 
accounting used to happen on yearly basis at the end of each financial year 
while during the year the government would borrow to its hearts content 
mortgaging the lives of future generations.
    
It took more than a decade for the IMF bureaucrats to realise what was 
happening. So with the signing of the current 15-month standby arrangement 
for $ 600 million of not so concessional assistance, the Fund imposed 
quarterly limits of bank borrowing for budgetary support.
    
It is more than certain that before the year comes to an end the Fund would 
have caught on to the trick because the trick is patently naive.
    
The biggest argument against financing the budget through bank borrowing is 
its after-effect that manifests in the shape of higher rates of inflation. 
So, as the government is taking the IMF for a ride while indulging in the 
crassest type of economic management, the rate of inflation is continuing 
to refuse to slow down impacting ever adversely on the lives of the teeming 
millions.
    
Obviously when as a result of this profligacy, the economy finally 
collapses, Vasim Jafarey and his company will not be around to answer for 
their follies and for being clever by half. The political government, on 
the other hand, if it is still around because of some miracle, then would 
have to suffer the ignominy of presiding over the virtual collapse of the 
economy.
    
The Prime Minister, by all standards is an intelligent person. But, somehow 
Mr. Jafarey and his company seem to have succeeded in befuddling her with 
figures like 4.6 per cent of GDP for budgetary borrowing for the year, 9.5 
per cent for the rate of inflation and a billion dollars of debt 
retirement.
    
She is parroting these figures seemingly without giving them a thought. 
Does she realise that as of today the budgetary borrowing has touched Rs 70 
billion (according to State Bank of Pakistans latest official figures) 
which is more than three times the figure of 4.6 per cent of GDP she is 
claiming it to be? The rate of inflation on the other hand is nearer to 11 
per cent rather than in single digit, according to the Federal Bureau of 
Statistics. And what is this talk about retirement of one billion dollars 
of debt? From where did Jafarey get this money and in what account did he 
retire it?
    
As a matter of fact, for fudging the budgetary borrowing figures, he is 
indulging in frequent short-term commercial borrowings from non-bank 
sources and rolling over past debts so as to create rupees against them 
with which to achieve short-term reduction in bank borrowing for budgetary 
support.
    
The IMF and the World Bank are not the most popular organisations in Third 
World countries, not because their prescriptions are wrong but because, 
their bureaucracy in league with the bureaucracy in these developing 
countries and in collaboration with the ruling elite (the feudals and big 
business) in these countries have tended to work against the interests of 
the majority of the population.
    
The former looks the other way when the latter takes liberties with agreed 
reform prescriptions creating illusions of reforms while, in fact, further 
distorting the economy to protect the interests of the ruling elite in the 
recipient countries.
    
But the perpetuation of such blatant and shamefaced frauds create their own 
peculiar kind of contradictions bringing into conflict the interests of the 
perpetrators themselves.
    
It was indeed a red-faced IMF and Pakistani bureaucracy which heard the 
American Ambassador Thomas W. Simons Jr., exposing them last week at a 
public forum.
    
American Ambassadors are never known to do anything other than promote 
their national interests in the host countries. So, when Ambassador Simons 
spoke about the corrupt red-tape in Pakistan, he was not sympathising with 
the people of Pakistan but warning against hurting the economic interests 
of prospective American investors in this country.
    
It was a simple case of Pakistani bureaucracy trying to fleece through red-
tape, in a self-created but IMF-certified illusionary liberal investment 
atmosphere. The investors from America, the country which actually holds 
the strings of the IMF and World Bank and uses these two multi-lateral 
organisations to promote and protect its interests throughout the world.
    
Here is what the American Ambassador said:  Let me give you the example of 
the experience of one company, whose name and line of business I will 
disguise only to protect the innocent. The firm did its homework, learned 
about the incentives available for its industry and location, lined up a 
reputable local partner, and, working closely with the governments one-
window operation, drew up plans for a new plant. But then other windows 
began to open up, and new approvals seemed to be needed.  Ministries the 
firm had never heard of appeared demanding the right to review construction 
plans. When these requirements were fulfilled and the plant was half-built, 
other inspectors appeared requiring environmental, safety and other 
approvals the investors thought had been taken care of. While the firm 
thought it was incorporating the latest fire-safety technology into design, 
one inspector noted that it still failed to comply with certain pre-
independence codes. Financial officials arrived and said that while the 
company had now obtained all required approvals and permissions, 
various consents were also needed. Local officials appeared and helpfully 
explained that the sudden shortage of cement could be ameliorated by 
contributions for canal maintenance.
    
When the factory was finally built and ready to start production, the firm 
learned that it could not import key components because these were locally 
available, though of quality far below the firms specifications. Tariff 
concessions it had agreed on with one window were unceremoniously 
withdrawnby another. In trying to resolve these issues, the firm 
encountered tax and customs officials whom no one had told that official 
policy was to increase foreign investment. Labour inspectors found the 
firms model practices still did not conform with a vital footnote the 
company had overlooked.
    
Before it ever entered production or earned a single rupee, it received a 
corporate income tax bill by taxmen who insisted that the firm had been 
around so long that it must be hiding its profits. Meanwhile, while all 
this was happening, the firm watched as an influential competitor, who 
started well after it did, virtually sailed through the construction and 
start-up phases with a minimum of hassle.
    
As usual the outgoing year has been one of lies and loot. In this the IMF 
and World Bank have also collaborated with Pakistans ruling elite which 
includes the civil-military bureaucracy, the feudal aristocracy, big 
business, tax evaders and smugglers. The incoming year also is not expected 
to be any better, if one goes by the visible attitude of the official and 
political managers of the national economy. In view of this, the on-going 
debate as to the exact amount of additional taxes that would be or could be 
imposed in the next budget and the pros and cons of the proposed IMF 
prescribed reforms to be introduced from July 1, 1996 has only assumed the 
significance of a non-issue.

<a name="over">Overhauling of planes to start at Chaklala</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

RAWALPINDI, May 25: Shaheen Foundation, a subsidiary of Pakistan Air Force 
and a Canadian company, CAE Aviation Ltd. on Saturday entered into 
agreement to set up a centre of excellence, for overhauling C-130s and 
commercial planes here at Chaklala Air Force base.
  
President CAE Aviation Larry Prokop and managing director of Shaheen 
Foundation Shafique Haider signed the agreement of the joint venture on 
behalf of their respective organisations.
  
Both the companies had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) during 
the visit of Canadian prime minister to Pakistan earlier this year.
  
The project which will be completed in a phase programme will require an 
investment of three to four million US dollars in the first stage, Mr. 
Haider told a press conference.
  
Subsequent stages will entail investment of several million dollars, he 
added.
  
The CAE having a vast experience in aircraft overhauling, upgrading and 
modification will have management control of the company with 63 percent 
shares while the remaining 37 percent will be owned by the Shaheen 
Foundation.
  
Mr Prokop said that they were contemplating to make the facility 
operational by the end of November.

He said initially the centre would cater only to C-130 transport planes of 
Pakistan Air Force but later it would provide service to commercial planes 
as well. This project is not specific to one kind of plane, he said.
  
Besides a large number of commercial planes about 200 C-130 planes were 
available in the region he added.
  
The project would provide both short and long term benefits to Pakistan. In 
the short term significant initial investment would be made by CAE Aviation 
to upgrade existing facilities and install the necessary tooling and 
equipment. Over the long term Pakistan would benefit not only through 
employment creation and the ensuing economic spin-offs, but also through 
the attraction of additional foreign investment that would result from the 
centre attracting foreign commercial and military aircraft to Pakistan, he 
added.

<a name="3000">300,000 WAPDA, PTC workers may lose jobs after privatisation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, May 25: As a result of the divestiture of Pakistan 
Telecommunications Corporation and WAPDA the number of workers to be laid 
off may rise to 300,000, according to a study by Pakistans leading 
economists.
  
Drawing upon the experience with the large-scale retrenchments in the 71 
public sector industrial units that have already been handed over to 
private sector up to 1992-93, Prof Nawab Haider Naqvi and Dr A.R. Kemal 
note that 43.26 per cent of their employees had accepted golden hand-shake 
mainly out of fear of subsequent dismissal by the new owners.
  
They observe: One very important indicator of the success or otherwise of 
privatisation is its impact on the level of employment in the privatised 
units. And here the preliminary estimates definitely suggest a worsening of 
the existing employment situation. In fact, the restructuring and the 
divestiture of public enterprises and the possible retrenchment of the 
employees working in them figured prominently in the Structural Adjustment 
Programme (SAP) for Pakistan of the IMF and the World Bank covering the 
period 1988-91.
  
The public sector enterprises being offered for sale in Pakistan employ 
more than 200,000 workers and their divestiture threatens at least one-half 
of these. Since these are white-collar workers who are expected to be hit 
the most, the employment problem of the educated youth may become even more 
acute as privatisation gathers momentum, the study has apprehended.
  
The situation in Pakistan-China Fertiliser in Haripur is illustrative of 
the new owners attitude. Numerous concessions obtained from the government 
after its take-over notwithstanding, they have removed 200 workers (one-
third of entire work-force), have not paid salaries even to those still on 
job and let the labour colony remain without electricity and water supply 
over the past several weeks.
  
Public enterprises in Pakistan had total assets of Rs 800 billion and 
employed more than 500,000 workers. The employment in these increased at a 
rate of 1.85 per cent compared to the growth of output at a rate of over 
6.5 per cent over the 1985-90 period. Actually, the increase in public 
sector employment was accounted for only by the Pakistan Steel which went 
into production in 1984-85, while it declined in other units.
  
The new owners of privatised enterprises, the study notes, are bound by 
agreement with the government not to lay off their workers in the first 
year. And yet, they are getting rid of the workers by encouraging/forcing 
them to opt for the golden hand- shake.
  
Most of those being so thrown out of jobs are educated workers who 
contribute to higher value-added, as the authors point out: The 
productivity of labour has, on average, been higher in the public sector 
industrial enterprises despite the alleged over- manning: in 1986-87, it 
was 8.7 per cent higher in public enterprise than in the private large 
scale manufacturing industries.

<a name="chan">Changes in govt-controlled financial institutions likely</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, May 29: A reshuffle at the top in five nationalised banks is 
being contemplated by the government ostensibly to inject an element of 
dynamism with a touch of prudence in the decision making process with 
regard to advances and also to gear up recovery operations.
 
The five banks, whose top management is likely to be changed either just 
before the budget announcement or soon after depending upon how soon the 
government completes the selection process, includes the National Bank of 
Pakistan, Habib Bank Ltd., National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC), 
Regional Development Finance Corporation (RDFC) and Habib Credit & 
Exchange.
 
In view of the continuing crisis in the nationalised banking sector, mostly 
the result of appointments without merit at the top with pliability to 
political dictation being the sole criteria for selection, it is being 
anticipated that while reshuffling the government would keep in mind this 
time around the case of United Bank Limited, the total mismanagement of 
which finally led to its take over by the State Bank.
 
Despite repeated directives from the prime minister not to entertain 
investment loan applications from ruling party MNAs and ministers, the 
nationalised banks have been known to have obliged them reportedly on 
telephonic directives from Islamabad.
 
The standard of banking in the country is said to have gone down steeply 
over the last 15 years because of the attempts of the successive 
governments to appoint on top jobs unqualified persons willing to accept 
dictation from Islamabad, no matter how economically unsound.
 
The impending reshuffle, therefore, has assumed an added significance and 
the banking sector is expecting that the selection process will not be 
allowed to be influenced by non-professional considerations and that it 
will be kept as transparent as possible.
 
Meanwhile, the 11-point reform agenda of the banking sector launched in 
1994 has come to a standstill with most of the prudential regulations 
enacted last year still awaiting enforcement.
 
The phasing out of credit-to-deposit ratio mechanism has also stopped. 
Complete elimination of mandatory credit targets for small business and 
industry has also not taken place. Also, harmonisation of tax and 
regulatory treatment of financial institutions and instruments is still to 
take place.

<a name="stoc">Stocks turn mixed as institutional traders move in</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, May 23: Stocks turned in an improved performance as institutional 
traders moved in to cover positions at the lower levels but the rally was 
inconclusive because of weekend considerations.
    
However, analysts said the persistent sell-off has been halted and now it 
is turn of bulls to tilt the balance in their favour in the coming 
sessions.
    
But some others said prices could fall further next week too as two 
closures on account of Ashura holidays are expected to prompt a lot of 
selling and profit-selling from jobbers and short-term dealers.
    
The KSE 100-share index rose 15.79 points to 1,701.76, regaining its 
psychological barrier as compared to 1,685.97 a day earlier, reflecting the 
strength of base shares.
    
Floor brokers said the recovery was not based on genuine buying support as 
general investors seldom make larger commitments at the weekend sessions 
for obvious reasons.
    
They said the current turmoil in the currency market is expected to fade 
out next week after the official intervention to keep the external value of 
the rupee stable.
    
The weekend recovery staged by the rupee, regaining 40 paisa showed that a 
process of correction has already been started and the rupee is expected to 
regain its lost strength, they added.
    
Dealers said some of the foreign investors might be worried over the snap 
reaction in the value of the rupee and strong rumours of official 
devaluation of the rupee but these fears are expected to be removed by the 
next week.
    
The recovery though was feeble partly because of weekend considerations, 
was largely led by the leading shares such as PSO, and Dawood Hercules, 
which recovered Rs 8 and 5 on strong support at the lower levels.
    
Other good gainers were led by Crescent Bank, Adamjee Insurance, Siemens 
Pakistan, Engro Chemicals, Quality Steel, and Fauji Fertiliser, which 
posted gains ranging from Rs 1.50 to 2.
    
Although losers again dominated the list, prominent among them being 
Pakistan Refinery and Mustehkam Cement, which fell by Rs 2 and 8 
respectively, some others also fell but modestly.
    
They were led by Atlas Bank, Dewan Textiles, Shell Pakistan, PEL 
Appliances, Abbott Lab, Parke-Davis, Reckitt and Colman, Sandoz Pakistan 
and Gillette Pakistan, falling by one rupee to Rs 1.50.
    
The most active list was again led by PTC vouchers, up 55 paisa on 10.675m 
shares, Hub-Power, steady 15 paisa on 8.346m shares, Dewan Salman, firm 15 
paisa on 1.667m, Dhan Fibre, also higher 15 paisa on 1.398m and FFC-Jordan 
Fertiliser, up 30 paisa on 1.063m shares.
    
Other actives included Faysal Bank, higher 25 paisa on 0.239m, Lucky 
Cement, firm 15 paisa on 0.282m, D.G Khan Cement unchanged on 0.129m and 
Sitara Energy, up 10 paisa on 0.128m shares.
    
Trading volume rose to 29.942m shares thanks to active short-covering in 
the current favourites as compared to 28.872m shares a day earlier.
    
There were 325 actively traded shares, out of which 140 suffered decline, 
while 107 rose, with 78 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="inde">Index expected to breach psychological barrier</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, May 29: Stocks again passed through a mixed session as investors 
played on both sides of the fence rolling positions from one counter to 
another depending on background news.
 
The KSE 100-share index managed to post a fresh modest gain of 5.30 points 
at 1,711.01 as compared to previous 1,705.71 as some of the base shares 
were quoted further higher.
 
The big question being asked in the rings was that whether or not the index 
will again breach the psychological barrier in the sessions preceding the 
national budget due on June 12 and there was an overwhelming opinion that 
it might as some of the basic fundamentals are against it.
 
They said all roads from the stock market now lead to the open market where 
the US currency has previously never been such an attractive bait as it is 
these days owing to strong rumours about devaluation of the rupee.

Floor brokers said strong speculative buying in the US currency might not 
be a permanent feature and this phenomenon could fade out after the budget 
but until then it keep the market in a bad taste.

Analysts said budget uncertainties are there and news of fresh heavy 
taxation to make up the huge deficit could keep the market unsettled during 
the sessions preceding the budget but selective support could emerge on 
selected counters alone on technical grounds. But they did not rule out the 
possibility of heavy covering purchasing on some of the blue chips counters 
led by the energy shares.
 
Already most of them are attracting good support at the current lower 
levels on expectations of further increase in POL prices.
 
PSO appeared to be virtually racing towards its pre-reaction level and 
could stabilise well above Rs 400 before the budget. It was followed by 
others notably Shell Pakistan, Ideal Energy, Sui Southern and Sui Northern 
and some others on strong buying at the lower levels.
 
Multinationals in the chemical and pharma sectors moved either way but 
there is a possibility of some incentives to this sector in the new budget. 
Dyno Pakistan, Reckitt and Colman, Fauji Fertiliser, Searle Pakistan, ICI 
Pakistan and some others rose on that perception.
 
Bank shares could be a good pre-budget buying area as their attractively 
lower levels ensure more than fair capital gains in the coming sessions 
alone on technical grounds.
 
MCB led rally was visible on other bank shares too, although rallies in 
Union Bank, Islamic Bank, Soneri Bank, Al-Faysal Bank and some others were 
too feeble to put them back on the rails.
 
News that most of them had earned good profit for the year ended December 
31, 1995, which is said to be the worst in the history of Pakistani banking 
owing to city violence, should also attract good covering purchases from 
genuine investors.
 
Insurance, cement and auto shares now appeared to be most attractive bait 
owing to news of higher interim profits and lower levels.
 
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 50 paisa on 12.692

<a name="thed">The Dozen of Dokri</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

WHEN the former five-term mayor of Houston, Katherine Whitmire, visited 
Karachi last week, the American Consulate arranged a reception for her to 
meet people of various hues, of various parties, local bodies, persuasions 
and beliefs.
    
Whilst she was discussing the plight of this metropolis and the 
governments apathy with a group of us, amongst which MQM lawyer Shoaib 
Bokhari and a yob who I could not place, clad in awami credentials and 
looking like a man who had just got out of bed, I mentioned that whilst I 
felt somewhat sorry for the 8,000 or so MQMites jailed in Sindh, more than 
half of whom could well be innocent and had neither been charged nor taken 
to court, I could have no sympathies with a party, also of fascistic 
tendencies, whose members have killed, tortured and maimed. At this, the 
yob interjected. Looking at Shoaib, he asked, Why dont you guys fix this 
man? The well-dressed well-mannered Bokhari averted his eyes and said 
nothing.
    
This local charmer turned out to be Nabil Gabol, Deputy Speaker of our 
august honourable Provincial Assembly. Yet another instance so well 
illustrating the attitude of the men who are elected by the ignorant poor 
people to positions of relative power.
    
Early next morning Babu Ghulam Sarwar Siyal rang, introducing himself as 
the president of the Press Club of Dokri, situated in the Royal Duchy of 
Larkana. He wanted to see me urgently. The lives of journalists in Sindh 
are in danger and he had come to Karachi to rally support. He came, 
bringing with him FIRs and press clippings in Sindhi and Urdu, all of which 
left me high and dry. So I sent him, and a Sindhi friend, off to Zamir 
Niazi who worked throughout the day on their translations.
    
The stories Siyal told were harrowing. Since January this year there have 
been fifteen incidents involving journalists in Sindh, threatening their 
lives and property. Journalist Mumtaz Sher of Village Jhol, District 
Sanghar, wrote a piece which angered a certain Wadera Kerio. Kerio had him 
picked up, he was tied and bound, his moustache, eyebrows and head were 
shaven, and he was then gang-raped by four men. With great difficulty an 
FIR was lodged. The Wadera has since obtained bail.
    
Of immediate concern is the plight of the journalists of Dokri. Monis 
Bokhari, a reporter of Daily Sindh wrote on how Nazeer Bhugio MPA of 
Larkana had illegally taken over 1,500 acres of land belonging to the Sindh 
Forest Department. In Zulfikar Bhuttos days father Waheed Baksh Bhugio is 
said to have grabbed 4000 acres of Forest and Revenue Department land, now 
known as Keti Bhugio (Bhugio Estate). On April 20, Monis took a bus from 
Dokri to Larkana, squatting on its roof. With him, on the roof, were four 
of Bhugios men. They grabbed him, put a noose around his neck and tried to 
throw him off and drag him behind the bus. He was saved by other passengers 
who thumped the bus to a halt.
    
The incident was immediately reported to the police at Dokri. The SHO did 
not allow Monis to file an FIR, but made a note on a piece of paper, told 
Moonis to think his lucky stars that he was not hanged from the roof of the 
bus, to get lost and leave it to them (the police) to do the needy.
    
The following day one of the four men from the bus, Bhugios armed guard, 
Abdul Rasool Shah, was arrested and locked up. Come the evening, and 
Hizbullah Bhugio, brother of the MPA, arrived at the police station with 
his men, was received with due servility, and ordered that Rasool Shah be 
released and that SHO Mehar Ali Tunio accompany them to his house. Once 
there, Brother Bhugio sent for Dr Inayat Kandhro of the local government 
hospital and ordered him to fabricate a medical certificate certifying that 
Shah had been beaten and injured. Thereafter, Hizbullah made Shah file an 
FIR (21/96) under Section 337 PPC (Whoever causes hurt to any person by 
doing any act so rashly and negligently as to endanger human life or the 
personal safety of others...) against Monis and others.
    
The next day, Bhugio reportedly ordered the police to arrest Monis and the 
men of his family. Nawab Bokhari, the father, escaped. Monis and his 
brother Daman were arrested and taken to Dokri police station. They were 
then produced before the Judicial Magistrate-1 of Larkana who challaned 
them and sent them to Larkana jail.
    
On April 26, some twenty journalists and sympathisers launched a protest 
and marched to the prime ministers house at Naudero to lodge their 
complaint against the Bhugios and to plead for the release of the Bokharis. 
The PMs security guards grabbed and destroyed their placards and two of 
their cameras.
    
On April 28, the journalists again reassembled and met at the Press Club. 
Two of Bhugios men, Arbab Ali Shah and Kazi Mansur, arrived to tell them 
that if they continued with their protest the Bhugio brothers would have 
them killed. Undaunted, the journalists started their march to Dokri police 
station to again plead for the Bokharis release. On the way, as the 
procession neared Mukhtiarkhar Riaz Jokhios house, a band of fifteen men, 
Arbab Ali Shah amongst them, armed with TT pistols, shotguns and hatchets 
attacked the protesters, beating up and badly injuring six of them. They 
continued on to the police station, with the injured men, to report the 
incident and told the police they would take those hurt to hospital to be 
treated, return, and file an FIR.
    
When they returned to the police station to lodge their FIR (23/96) against 
Bhugios men, they were informed that whilst they were at the hospital an 
FIR (22/96) had been filed by Arbab Ali Shah against Moniss father and 
nine journalists: Babu Ghulam Sarwar Siyal (Nawa-i-Waqt), Mohammed Ramzan 
Junejo (Kawish), Zamir Bhatti (Barsat), Abdul Haq Pirzado (Awami Awaz), 
Secretary of the Press Club Qazi Abdul Wahab Junejo (Pukar), Mushtaq Ahmed 
Soomro (Jang), Deedar Ali (Mehran), Asad Ali Junejo (Sindh Shujad), Qazi 
Asif (formerly of Mehran).
    
Thus, on the filing of a false FIR, the accused, the men of the MPA, were 
transformed into the accusers.
    
On May 2, the journalists went on a three-day hunger strike in Larkana. On 
May 5, DC, Larkana Shams Jafrani intervened. He promised that falsifier Dr 
Kandhro would be removed (not done), that the false FIR (22/96) would not 
be acted upon (but this can be activated at any time), and that Bhugios 
men would be apprehended (Arbab Ali Shah and three others were arrested on 
May 6 and released that same evening).
    
Meanwhile, Monis and his brother have been released on bail. But no action 
whatsoever has been taken by anyone against the men who have threatened and 
injured the journalists. The threats continue, the journalists and their 
families fear for their safety and property. MPA Bhugio of Larkana and 
those of the ruling party are powerful men. No action can or will be taken 
against any of them.
    
Ghulam Sarwar Sial says that the journalists of Sindh are very poor, very 
underpaid, and many of them have to do other jobs to make ends meet. The 
Dokri Press Club comprises one room, given by the town council, and a table 
and ten chairs donated by various citizens. It cannot afford a telephone, a 
fax machine, or a television. The Director of Information at Larkana, Allah 
Bachayo Memon, arrived at the club on April 19 with a bunch of 
photographers, and had himself photographed handing over a cheque for Rs 
100,000 dated some time in January, saying that the Mohtarama had been kind 
enough to sanction the donation. The cheque has been deposited but so far 
it has not been encashed by Islamabad. The journalists are aware that if 
they do receive the money it is the peoples money that will be doled out 
to them. At least they will put it to good use.
    
I asked Siyal about the freely and fairly elected peoples representatives 
of the area. Could they not be called upon to help their constituents? 
Siyal laughed. The MPAs are Bhugio, Nisar Khuhro, Nadir Magsi, Mir Murtaza 
Bhutto and Mumtaz Ali Bhutto. The MNAs are Benazir Bhutto, Nusrat Bhutto, 
Shabbir Ahmed Chandio (a kinsman of the Chandio allegedly involved in the 
Karachi land grab of the property of octogenarian Professor Nusrat Ashraf). 
Which one of these do you suggest we approach, he asked me?
    
The Dozen of Dokri are fighting tyranny. They must be helped. The Karachi 
Union of Journalists are supportive. The New York- based Committee for the 
Protection of Journalists has been informed. Our judiciary has found its 
teeth. I told the Dozen to fight on. Nothing lasts for ever. All things 
pass, including our leaders.

<a name="ther">The real threat to our ideological frontiers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

IF our ideological frontiers (more precious than our geographical ones) 
face a mortal threat from any quarter, it is not from the dances of Ms 
Madhuri Dixit (deadly as her curves and gyrations are) but from the news as 
telecast nightly from Zee TV.
    
Strange as it may sound to Pakistani ears which for higher but mysterious 
purposes of ideology have had to put up with the drivel that passes for 
news from their own television, the news on Zee TV is not a propaganda tool 
of the government of the day. It gives you the political news honestly and 
professionally, telling you about the splits in the Congress, the 
difficulties facing the BJP in getting a majority and the views of all the 
newsworthy politicos in the land. More surprisingly, Zee TV even gives you 
a better picture of what is happening in occupied Kashmir than our own sad 
apology for a propaganda channel.
    
Our state-run TV (which in this age of the free market continues to 
monopolise the telecasting of news) gives an impression of concoction even, 
say, when it is quoting from the Scriptures. This is because it lacks 
professionalism and credibility. Zee TV, on the other hand, has the ring of 
authenticity about it. So even when it says something about occupied 
Kashmir the dispassionate listener (mark the distinction) will be more 
inclined to give his ear to it than to the stupefaction and inanities that 
he gets to hear from Pakistan Television which is still informed by the 
spirit of the old Pravda and Soviet television as these two monuments to 
the truth existed in the heyday of the Soviet empire.
    
I have seen Leni Riefenstals (I hope I have got the spelling right) film 
of the 1934 Nuremberg Rally. It is propaganda but of the highest sort: 
slick, effective and almost a work of art. That the sad bilge which passes 
for the news is nothing of the sort is no fault of the staff members of PTV 
who are dragooned into churning out the stuff that they do. The fault lies 
at the doors of successive guardians of the national interest  whether in 
uniform or civvies  who have held tight to the belief that if state 
television is allowed to tell the truth as it is, rather than as it is seen 
through the myopic and frightened eyes of the rulers of the day, the 
ideological foundations of the Islamic Republic will be imperilled. Thus, 
at a time when every wiseacre in the land is mouthing the cliches that the 
world has become a global village and that we stand at the threshold of the 
21st century, PTV continues to live in the age of the dinosaurs.
    
To say that smart people do not watch television, especially of the home-
grown variety, is not a very helpful line to take because there are a lot 
of unsmart people out there who like to know what goes on and what antics 
their leaders are up to. Lest anyone be taken in by the seeming power of 
the Press it is pertinent to point out that in this nation of 130 million 
(or given our natural talent for procreation, is it 140?) the daily 
circulation of all newspapers  Urdu, English, Sindhi and Gujrati  does 
not exceed a million. The rest of the population watches television. PTVs 
monopoly on the truth is thus no trivial matter. If we are at all concerned 
about the state of our democracy and the poor quality of our national 
discourse, and if we wonder why our governing classes are so removed from 
ordinary realities, then the Orwellian role of state television has to be 
brought into focus if only for the extent of its insidious reach.
    
This is not to say for a moment that people are taken in by the false 
images that they see on PTV. Presidents and prime ministers do not become 
more powerful or more popular by being paraded on television all the time. 
It is not even far-fetched to suppose that many otherwise calm and sane 
people are overtaken suddenly by the desire to hurl some hard object at 
their television sets when they see the usual cast of characters  the 
President, the Prime Minister, chief ministers, assorted ministers and, 
every now and then, the Chairman of the Pakistan Environmental Protection 
Council  going through the same deadly motions evening after evening. But 
the matter goes far beyond the co-relation between propaganda and power.
    
The false or half-true images peddled by PTV do not make anyone strong but 
they make us as a nation look very weak and vulnerable. It is almost as if 
the truth would destroy us and that to keep ourselves safe from the truth 
it is necessary to cocoon ourselves from reality which is a function state 
television in Pakistan performs to perfection.
    
If there was a point to this silliness it would be easy to justify it. But 
there is none. India is not a country whose internal fabric is inherently 
stronger than ours. In fact, a reasonably convincing case could be made out 
for arguing that Pakistan does not face the kind of regional pressures 
India does. The problems of Karachi, serious as they may be, pale besides 
those of occupied Kashmir or the ones that existed not long ago in Indian 
Punjab. The rise of the BJP poses a fundamental challenge to the secular 
form of the Indian state. Despite the nonsense that periodically recurs in 
the Western Press about religious fundamentalism in Pakistan, there is no 
challenge similar to the BJPs that threatens the moorings of our polity. 
Yet to watch the news on Zee TV (something I have only just started doing 
and hence the amazement with which I am writing about it) is to come away 
with the impression of a society which is confident of itself and 
comfortable with its democracy. To watch PTV, on the other hand, is to come 
away with the impression of a frightened country  uncomfortable with 
democracy and mortally afraid of the truth. Do the godfathers of the 
national interest think that this comparison does anything for our national 
honour?
    
Nothing could have emphasised this comparison more than the coverage of the 
recent general elections in India by Zee TV. The news was given as it 
happened, there being absolutely no question of this channel (or indeed 
others for all I know) acting as propaganda tools of the ruling party. The 
Congress was not glorified nor the BJP made the target of vilification. 
After the results were in each and every nuance of the power game that 
started in New Delhi was faithfully reported  which leader was meeting 
whom and what the feeling inside the various parties was. In Pakistan, as 
we all know only too well, PTV acts as a crude handmaiden of whichever 
party is in power. Its strident propaganda does no good to anyone because 
its word is not believed. But the countrys self-esteem suffers because the 
only honest reaction to the slaughter of the truth at its hands is to hang 
ones head in shame.
    
There is a pragmatic side to this equation as well. The freedom of the 
independent TV channels in India forms part of the democratic ambience 
which gives legitimacy and credibility to the electoral process. An 
election takes place and whatever the results there are no charges of 
rigging. The political process goes on. In Pakistan, on the other hand, 
there has not been a single election since 1970 whose results have been 
accepted by all parts of the political spectrum. Even now as the PPP 
government has completed more than half its term in office the fear is 
growing about how the next elections would be conducted. Voting lists are 
no sooner made than they are challenged because the Election Commission 
which oversees this process lacks the authority or the credibility that it 
should have in a democratic society and which it certainly has in 
neighbouring India. The Indian Election Commissioner, T. N. Seshan, who has 
been very strict about enforcing election rules, is not really a phenomenon 
in Indian politics. In India for someone like Seshan to appear on the scene 
seems like a natural outgrowth of the countrys democratic culture. Someone 
like him would truly be a phenomenon were he to appear on the scene in 
Pakistan.
    
The trouble perhaps lies in our democratic culture. We have the forms of 
democracy (which we are trying our best to subvert) without its substance. 
All our political parties except the Jamaat-i-Islamic (which is a strange 
exception in itself considering the Jamaats fascist leanings) are based on 
the Fuehrer principle  a leader above laying down the law and being 
answerable to no one. Once in power these same leaders behave like 
mediaeval princes: autocratic, overbearing and bristling at the slightest 
check on their authority. General Zia ul Haq was being honest when he said 
that the Constitution was a document of so many pages that he could tear to 
pieces whenever he wanted. He merely was putting into words a feeling that 
nearly all Pakistani rulers have shared. Should it be all that surprising 
then if successive Pakistani rulers, instead of abiding by the rules of 
democracy, have tried to bend its forms in order to stay in power?
    
In the Civil Service Academy, the Army staff College, the National Defence 
College and, above all, in the inner sanctum of the ISI the watching of the 
news on Zee TV should be made compulsory for some time so that the 
guardians of our national security, after wiping the mist of misplaced 
patriotism from their eyes, can see for themselves that freedom does not 
necessarily lead to chaos. Nor does sitting over the truth make for a 
strong country.

<a name="afre">A free Press is the key to democracy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Benazir Bhutto

IT WAS 18 years ago this month that the dictatorship of Gen. Zia-ul-Haq 
began its notorious crackdown on the Pakistani Press. Four Pakistani 
journalists were tied to a rack and lashed with a whip. Their crime? 
Thinking independently and refusing to publish the official government 
story.
 
The general knew what has been made clear to us time and again in recent 
history: The key to maintaining a stranglehold on power is muzzling the 
Press. Control the information, and you control the minds of the people.
 
Zia-ul-Haq moved quickly to crack down on his opponents and critics. The 
unnatural silence that followed could then be claimed as implicit support 
for his regime  proof that he had a consensus behind his illegal rule.
 
For it is in the din of the free Press that democracy is born. Its in the 
clash of ideas and the confrontation of how to deal with issues that debate 
takes place, the public can be informed and the leaders made accountable in 
a fair and free general elections.
 
By choking off the free flow of information, authoritarian regimes such as 
Zia-ul-Haqs bend the Press to their will. Oppression is projected as 
social justice. Stagnation is reported as dynamism. And voices of dissent 
representing sanity are misrepresented as discordant notes from enemy 
agents.
 
Soon after his crackdown, the general no longer had to resort to the whip 
as his only means of control. Through martial law and regulations enforced 
by the threat of imprisonment, censorship was imposed. At first, it was in 
the form of news items excised from newspapers, leaving only blank space in 
their place. Since empty pages were suspicious, however, the regime imposed 
a ban on all blank spaces  and then prohibited newspapers from informing 
the public of this new rule.
 
Finally, a Press advisory system was put in place. Publications were 
advised on what not to print (for a time, this included my family name). 
They were also advised to print whatever was sent to them. This system 
deteriorated to the extent that government officials directly called news 
desks with orders on what to publish and under what headline, bypassing 
editors entirely.
 
But many brave members of the Press did not bend to these threats and 
impositions. Human destiny is shaped by the few who dare to challenge an 
unjust order when others are frightened into silence. Human destiny is 
changed when a few dedicate their lives selflessly to an ideal larger than 
themselves. Human destiny is affected by ordinary men and women who develop 
a character of iron in extraordinary circumstances.
 
The more un-just a situation, the greater the anger. The greater the anger, 
the greater the passion. The greater the passion, the greater the de-
termination. And it was this determination that finally rolled back the 
dictatorship and led to a renaissance of the free Press in our country. It 
is an irony of fate that injustice often incites the greatest human 
creativity.
 
Today, visitors to Pakistan can contrast the current freedom of the Press 
with the humiliation that was heaped upon the media not too long ago. They 
can watch as those who kept silent in those days of terror are free to 
publish what they will, whether its fair or unfair criticism, just or 
unjust accusation.
 
But this highlights one of the dangers that can arise in this exuberance of 
new liberty: some journalists are not acutely aware of the inseparability 
of freedom and responsibility. Some overlook their basic responsibility of 
checking, rechecking and once again checking their information until solid 
facts are sifted from rumours.
 
A baseless report, for example, recently caused panic on our stock 
exchange, before the truth was known. And those who lost millions turned 
their fury on the government, which they accused of lacking the will to 
govern.
 
Instances like these challenge any government that is nurturing the sapling 
of democracy. A tabloids screaming headlines on a baseless story can cause 
considerable damage before the wrong information is corrected.
 
This, however, is no excuse for the intolerance some public officials have 
for the Press. While the reporters talking to them are required to observe 
a modicum of decency, politicians cannot make an awkward question a 
justification to slap the offending reporter.
 
Following a long bout of authoritarianism that bred an elitist culture, 
some of the Press and some public figures need time to discover the new 
rules of the game. And journalists pay the heaviest price until democracys 
roots go deep enough for everyone to recognise the peoples right to know 
all that affects their lives.
 
No democracy is possible without the free flow of information. It is when 
the people are kept in the dark that the greatest travesties in our world 
have occurred. It is when journalists are whipped for telling the truth 
that we are in the greatest danger.

<a name="thep">The politics of plots</a>                                                        
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

THE current round of mud-slinging over the now-notorious housing scheme 
(for scheme, read scam) for parliamentarians carved out of Quaid-i-Azam 
University land continues to echo in the National Assembly and the national 
Press.
    
The whole thrust of this edifying debate is towards establishing which set 
of politicians is more venal than the other. The Opposition is using 
parliamentary plots and prime ministerial Mercedes as a brush to tar the 
government with, while the latter is responding with co-operative society 
swindles and industrial larceny. In effect, the government spokesmen are 
saying that because their predecessors were crooked, they have no right to 
moralise over the current level of corruption. Both sides having tacitly 
admitted to financial skulduggery on a grand scale; what remains to be 
decided is the quantum of cash and guilt.
    
Reading daily accounts of these uplifting charges and counter- charges, one 
is left with a sense of wonder at the sheer brazenness of those making 
them. If one were to believe them all, one would be driven either to 
suicide or murder. However, even a cursory examination of the lifestyle of 
most of our public representatives reveals an income flow quite removed 
from their earning capacity in any legal endeavour. So where is the cash 
coming from? And yet these people have the gall to queue up for yet more 
plots at throwaway prices on the QAU campus next to the diplomatic enclave. 
To hear them defend this latest scam, you would think they and their 
families were starving and homeless. Already, a market price for these 
plots has been set by real estate sharks who are offering a profit of six 
million per allotment letter. This amount should just about pay for the 
next election campaign each of our representatives will no doubt launch in 
the next general election.
    
To add insult to injury those MPs are further justifying this latest smash-
and-grab job on the basis of their service to us. Hey, dont bother! Well 
somehow muddle along without parliamentary intercession with the gods. 
Another reason that is being trotted out by the government to defend the 
indefensible is that the current crop of MNAs and Senators need a place to 
live in when parliament is in session. This pathetic excuse is based on the 
perception that we are unaware about the many parliamentary lodges and 
hostels that proliferate in Islamabad, with many more new ones mushrooming 
in the city. This is in addition to the numerous suites maintained by all 
the provincial governments in the federal capital. After spending literally 
billions on the care and comfort of our representatives, it is a bit silly 
to pretend that they are going to build houses in a city which is not their 
home, and which they may have to leave after the next election. Amen.
    
In a sense, this scam is not far different from the one being perpetrated 
in the name of a housing colony for QAU staff. In both cases, a finite and 
valuable resource is being divided up to satisfy current need and greed. In 
the case of university teachers, what happens when their junior colleagues 
have taught for ten years, thus qualifying for a plot? Will more land be 
carved up? Similarly, what happens when a hungry new crew of 
representatives are voted in? Will more land from the university be 
expropriated to satisfy their lust for plots? A university has a life span 
far greater than an individuals, but at this rate, it seems that QAU will 
have no land to expand in after a generation or so.
    
The sad fact is that university teachers have placed themselves at par with 
our parliamentarians. Granted that they are not well off; but when they 
chose this profession, they knew that they were opting for a life of 
genteel poverty. To suddenly agitate for plots of university land is 
neither decorous nor dignified. After all, their colleagues in other cities 
are not clamouring to chop up land belonging to Karachi or Punjab 
universities. Obviously, the land fever afflicting our MPs is contagious.
    
One argument is that because defence personnel and civil servants can get 
cheap plots, teachers should too. By all means. But surely not at the 
expense of a university. There is nothing to stop QAU staff from 
approaching CDA for land and establishing a housing colony. Every 
profession from the judiciary to journalists has done so, so why is the 
university being sliced up for professors?
    
The interest and disgust evoked by these parallel land-grabs can be judged 
from the letters to editors pouring into newspapers across the country. In 
a sense, this is the tip of the iceberg. Revulsion over corruption has 
reached critical mass. In drawing rooms, airport lounges and restaurants, 
all the talk is about the latest crooked deal. Newspapers are full of 
innuendo about people too powerful to be named in print. Embarrassingly, 
they are named by foreign diplomats and journalists in private 
conversation.
    
When confronted with this plethora of charges, members of the government at 
every level demand proof as if corrupt politicians and bureaucrats hand out 
printed receipts on accepting a bribe. All one has to do is look at these 
peoples lifestyle: if a secretary whose salary is a matter of public 
record spends millions on his childs wedding, there is a prima facie case 
for an investigation. More so if these functions have been graced and 
closely observed by the Prime Minister and the President.
    
But if its proof they want, heres some over a year ago. I had mentioned a 
scam in these columns which consisted of selling KDA land at a ridiculously 
low price. The plot in question consists of nearly 10,000 square yards of 
prime land adjacent to the newly-opened Awami Markaz on Shahrah-i-Faisal 
which has been sold to something called Swiss Resorts and hotels. I have no 
idea who this company belongs to, excepting that the Sindh Chief Minister 
has been exceptionally kind to the owners: he has ordered the sale of this 
plot to them at Rs 5,000 per square yard when land on this stretch of road 
costs at least Rs 25,000 per square yard. Thus, the beneficiary of this 
kindness stands to make a cool 200 million, if he has not already done so. 
It would not be difficult to verify this transaction by calling for the 
relevant KDA files. Incidentally, this sale was also reported by other 
newspapers at the time, but obviously, nobody was very interested in 
proof then, and I have no reason to think that things have changed since.
    
However, nothing in life is static: just because the last twenty years have 
witnessed a depressing increase in the level of corruption, it does not 
follow that the people of Pakistan will endlessly accept more of the same. 
Corruption acts like an acid on the system, and after some time, it 
corrodes the structure. That is what is happening now. The response Imran 
Khan has received on his entry into politics is an indicator of how fed up 
people have become with the system and those responsible for debasing it. 
The next elections may yet surprise us all.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="dome">Domestic cricket top priority: Majid Khan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, May 24: The newly appointed Chief Executive of the Pakistan 
Cricket Board (PCB), Majid Khan, stressed that one of his main policies 
will be to promote domestic cricket and develop infrastructure facilities 
in the country.
    
Majid, who represented Pakistan in 63 Tests, maintained that the country 
was full of talented cricketers but steps to explore that potential was 
required.
    
Majid, a graceful opener who had all the shots in his bag, didnt comment 
more on his other policies saying that he had yet to study various things, 
including the constitution that was amended last year with the consent of 
the Patron.
    
Majid, also a useful off-spinner, said he was not sure how many days it 
will take him to hold the charge. He stated that he has yet to receive the 
official notification and will then have to wait for the release from the 
Pakistan Television where he is Sports Director.
    
Majid, who represented English County Glamorgan, on the expected changes in 
the team, said it was premature to comment. He didnt also commit if he 
would bring changes in the team management presently consisting of Yawar 
Saeed and Nasimul Ghani who were approved by the Council and announced a 
day before Arif Abbasi, former Chief Executive, tendered his resignation to 
President Leghari.
    
According to reports published in upcountry papers, the immediate reaction 
of Majid was that he had expressed his disappointment over the ouster of 
Ramiz Raja, Aqib Javed and Basit Ali.
    
The exclusion, as far as of two players (Aqib Javed and Ramiz Raja) is 
concerned, is not on the basis of form or performance, Majid opined.
    
Majid may presumably be consulting knowledgeable people as to how to get 
over the constitutional hindrance, if any, after the selectors had 
completed their assigned work.

<a name="flaw">Flaws in England-bound cricket combination</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

The 17-member team for the England tour, which will extend to Canada and 
Kenya, had a few surprises and can, under no circumstance, be taken as a 
balanced one, having the best pack of the country.
    
It cannot obtain the approval of the followers of the game, not to say the 
veterans and former Test stars, the technocrats of cricket. Already 
critical voices are being raised and former Test captain and a player 
belonging to the first phase of Pakistans cricket, Imtiaz Ahmad, has 
pointed to the loopholes in the chosen set and depletion in the team 
resulting from the exclusion of a few determined fighters, who were by his 
reckoning essential, personnel.
    
Though the Chief Executive of the cricket board, Arif Ali Abbasi, had in 
his usual confident vein, told the Pressmen that the conglomerate was the 
result of unanimity among the selectors and the Council members one has to 
take his statement with a pinch of salt. One selector, an energetic member 
of the panel and a keen judge of the game, Salahuddin Sallu, had left for 
England two days earlier for the treatment of his wife. He could have 
delayed his departure to attend the final meeting of the selection 
committee but even before that the decision had been swayed by the presence 
of Wasim Akram, an ex-officio member of the panel. He had been out of 
commission since the Lahore World Cup match against New Zealand and had not 
seen the home lot in action since then. Being the captain he was invited to 
the selectorial caucus and vented out his views not on the basis of the 
merits of the players and their performances in the domestic circuit but 
presumably and regretfully on his likes and dislikes. Perhaps Wasim Akram 
followed the example of former captain Imran Khan (now lost to politics) 
who wanted a full say in the selection of the squad. Being a commander on 
the field, according to Imrans logic, the captain should have his own 
infantry and weaponry. Whatever may have been the cricketing status of the 
members of the selection committee they would adopt a quiet posture.
    
When one goes through the Council-approved list it becomes evident that no 
clear-cut policy was before the selectors, the Council and the board. The 
best available cricketers are assembled to form the strongest possible and 
the most balanced squad to represent the country to get the dividends 
abroad, especially when later the team has to make a detour of Canada and 
measure strength with arch-rivals, India. Agreed that England is in an 
anaemic state and getting the injections of red blood corpuscles as one 
finds in the county matches or the ties that India to-date has played. A 
risk can hardly be taken, besides against India the country cannot expect a 
repetition of a stumble after the Sharjah setback.
    
While giving out the principles of the selection the Chief Executive said 
they were based on merit and gut feeling, though in another breath he 
laid stress on trying out the younger elements. Certainly the cricketers 
with a promising future have to be encouraged but not before they have 
matured enough to take up the international challenge with full confidence 
and technical ability. Their failure will put undue burden and strain on 
the experienced players, some of whom are susceptible to injuries or 
illness  a doubtful knee, groin or back. On the new setting and atmosphere 
in England and the difficult strips there one can only hope that the 
untried cricketers are successful.
    
Some of the deserving cases have been side-tracked as reserves with the 
explanation that they could not have been considered for reasons of 
indiscipline. No show cause notices were issued, neither they were 
reprimanded. The very fact that they have been put on the list of reserves 
means that their exclusions were not due to indiscipline or misconduct.
    
Pakistans bowling resources usually had been adequate enough to harass and 
worry the rival line-ups in international duels. The furious pace and swing 
of Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram (just back to fitness after breaking down 
before the Bangalore World Cup match) would shake any batsman, howsoever 
organised his technique may be. The variety with the spin of Mushtaq and 
Saqlain would puzzle the batsmen. However the ouster of Aqib Javed, an 
effective strike bowler, can hardly be justified while seeing the 
preference accorded to Ataur Rahman, Mohammad Akram and Shahid Nazir. The 
first-mentioned was hammered by Azharuddin in the Sharjah triangular to all 
parts of the ground for 24 runs in one over. The Indian captains 
swashbuckling cost Pakistan the match. He did not appear at the KRL ground 
in Rawalpindi to prove his present form. Mohammad Akram has an unimpressive 
record in international cricket while Shahid Nazir can show only a tally of 
eight wickets in two Quaid Trophy matches.
    
Aqib, on the contrary, has a successful record in inter-country ties. He 
had been a fine ally of Wasim and Waqar and would usually have the 
breakthrough in the initial overs as in Singapore against India and Sri 
Lanka. At Sharjah he removed Tendulkar for one in the inaugural game. In 
the recent Pentangular matches at home he had the bite and penetration to 
snap wickets. With away experience his omission is surprising and may 
weaken the pace attack. Recently he had been showing a straight bat when 
sent at the tail-end of the innings, which was an added help to the side.
    
In batting the recall of the left-hand all-rounder, Asif Mujtaba, cannot 
but be welcomed. However sad is the ouster of two dependable and steady 
batsmen in Rameez Raja and Basit Ali, who have been found to be disciplined 
in their modes and methods while facing the rival bowling and giving 
strength to the innings.
    
A review of the selected combination after it has been endorsed by the 
Executive Council is hardly done but in this case in the interest of 
cricket and the country such a procedure should advisably be adopted. The 
better and the deserving pack should fly out to England for training before 
friendly matches are played against Holland and then the tour proper 
starts. The England schedule and the Canadian combat are hard and testing 
for the team as also for the innocents going abroad for the first time.

<a name="inti">Intikhabs critical report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter
    
KARACHI, May 24: Former Pakistan manager Intikhab Alam has submitted a 
critical report about the tours of Singapore and Sharjah.
    
Intikhab, who lost the job for the tour of England, says in his two-page 
report that senior players of the team have lost pride in playing for 
Pakistan.
    
In particular, Intikhab has named Aqib Javed and Waqar Younis saying that 
the two acted unprofessionally during the tours of Singapore and Sharjah.
    
Its time that the board should make the players realise that they are 
playing for the country and are being paid heavily, Intikhab has said.
    
The former Pakistan captain has reported that Aqib Javed and Waqar Younis 
didnt extend their full co-operation to skipper Aamir Sohail on the two 
tours. He has also confirmed the incident in which Aamir Sohail became 
extremely upset when Waqar and Aqib changed the ball in Sharjah against 
India without taking him into confidence. India won that match after 
reaching over 280 runs in 50 overs.
    
Intikhab has also blamed Ramiz Raja for setting a bad example for the 
youngsters when he did not go out to field when he was the 12th man.
    
I think the three players have very serious attitude problem which needs 
to be sorted out, Intikhab has recommended.
    
Skipper Aamir Sohail has also been criticised by Intikhab Alam for using 
very abusive language with the players. Intikhab admits in his report that 
though Sohail was undoubtedly a very valuable cricketer, he needs to 
overcome his loose temperament.
    
Intikhab has cited three incidents in his report about Aamir Sohail.
    
In the first incident, Sohail had refused to attend the prize distribution 
ceremony to receive the losers cheque after India beat Pakistan. I forced 
him to go out. He did accept the cheque but threw it to one of the players.
    
In another incident, Sohail used foul language with Salim Malik who 
returned to the dressing room and had I not requested Malik to take the 
field, he would have never gone out, Intikhab writes.

<a name="trai">Training camp at Lahore gets going</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, May 29: Fifteen players out of the 17 picked for the Pakistan 
cricket team for the tour of England reported on the opening day at the 
Qadhafi Stadium. Test opener Saeed Anwar will join after recovering from 
fever and Mushtaq Ahmad will also join soon.
 
The morning session in the camp is reserved for physical training and 
fitness exercises. During the afternoon session held from 4-30 to 6-30 , 
the players were seen engaged in gruelling net-practice. Under the guidance 
of the physiotherapist Dr Dan Kiesel, the cricketers did brisk-walking and 
running also in the sweltering heat of Lahore. The camp training will be in 
top gear within a few days.
 
While replying to a question from this correspondent, Secretary Ghulam 
Mustafa Khan hinted that the Cricket Manager Nasim-ul-Ghani may take charge 
of the camp within a couple of days. He said that Team Manager had been in 
Lahore for the last four or five days and had been visiting the Pakistan 
Cricket Board Headquarters regularly.

Captain Wasim Akram seemed to have fully recovered from injury to his rib-
cage muscle. He not only came to the Stadium in the morning, but also took 
part in net-practice. In fact, he supervised the training session in the 
afternoon.
 
While talking to this correspondent in the Stadium, the great all-rounder 
(Wasim Akram) said that he had not been intimated about the PCB Council 
meeting. He also dispelled rumours about any changes being made in the 17-
member squad already picked for the tour of England. At least, I have no 
knowledge whether any changes will be made in the Pakistan team or not. I 
can be contacted to get any sort of information about the team and the 
players. said the skipper with a smile.
 
In reply to a question about Saeed Anwars illness, Wasim Akram said that 
that was not of serious nature. He said that both Mushtaq Ahmad and Saeed 
Anwar had genuine reasons for being absent from the camp on the first day. 
They will join the camp soon. All the other boys were in the camp. They are 
trying hard to be 100 per cent fit and looked serious to give away their 
best during the tour of England this summer.
 
Those who attended the camp include: 
 
Aamir Sohail, Shahid Anwer, Shadab Kabir, Inzamamul Haq, Salim Malik, Ijaz 
Ahmed, Asif Mujtaba, Waqar Younis, Wasim Akram, Mohammad Akram, Ataur 
Rahman, Shahid Nazir, Saqlain Mushtaq, Rashid Latif and Moin Khan.

<a name="prot">Protesting hockey players plea to PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From Our Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, May 29: The five representatives of the revolting 24 national 
hockey players, viz Shahbaz Ahmad, Tahir Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Junaid, 
Asif Bajwa and Naveed Alam told newsmen during a crowded Press conference 
at the outer ground of the National Hockey Stadium that all efforts of 
wooing some of their companions would fail and they could appear in the 
trials only if their demands were met.
 
The representatives said that four players out of them had been offered 
captaincy to break their unity, but all of them refused to swallow the 
bait.
 
The players made a fervent appeal to the Patron of the Pakistan Hockey 
Federation (PHF) Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to intervene before things 
get out of control. They said that they had been serving hockey for the 
last so many years and had brought honour to the country. They had been 
forced to take this painful decision because things had been made 
unbearable for them through high-handedness. They said that if the 
management of the team was not changed, mode of selection of team through 
selectors was not altered and the PHF Secretary was not removed from the 
office, they would neither appear in the national trials nor make a trip to 
Atlanta. They said that earnest efforts to win back the Olympic title 
could only be made if the players were free from all types of stresses and 
strains.
 
Shahbaz Ahmad, who had been captaining the team for the last so many years, 
said: Captaincy is and was never an issue. It has been created by the PHF 
bosses. He and his companions made the demands many days before the final 
trials, but the PHF Secretary and President kept on delaying the matters 
unnecessarily. So they were not left with any alternative but to make their 
demands public in the larger interest of Pakistan and out national game.
 
While replying to a question Shahbaz Ahmad said that no one could guarantee 
victory in the Olympic Hockey Tournament. However, all the players would 
make a genuine and honest effort to bring honour to the nation as they had 
been doing in the past. He said that the Pakistan Government had made the 
players richer by millions after the victory in the 1994 World Hockey Cup 
at Sydney so they had no ill-will against that.
 
They had not at all been pressurised by any quarters and their protest 
was the result of hard feelings. Shahbaz said that non-technical persons 
had been named in the probe committee only to put the departmental 
pressures on the players through them.
 
The Olympic half-back Khawaja Mohammad Junaid said that even the reserve 
players, who had not joined their protest were sick and tired of the PHF 
bosses, but they to keep away as they had been pressurised by their coach 
and club-mentor in Gojra Mohammad Iqbal Bali.
 
The protesting-players present in Lahore will continue their training at 
the National Hockey Stadium. Besides doing physical exercises in the 
morning, they will do practice of the game in the afternoon.</pre>
