------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, April 23: Pakistan received the first refund cheque of 124 
million dollars from the United States marking the implementation of the 
Brown Amendment which provides for shipment of military equipment worth 
$368 million as well.
    
This amount represents the first tranche of the $658 million that the 
US owes Pakistan for the money it paid for the F-16 aircraft, a 
Pakistan Embassy Press release said.
    
The cheque was handed over by Director Defence Security Assistance 
Agency Lt. General Thomas G. Rhame to Pakistan Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi 
at a short and simple ceremony at the office of the Agency.
    
The refund of $124 million marks the first concrete step towards 
fulfilment of the commitment made by President Clinton to Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto that the US will refund to Pakistan the money it paid for 
the planes, the Embassy said.
    
Sources told Dawn another payment of $160 million was to be made 
sometime in June and then Pakistan will have to wait for the disposal of 
the F-16 aircraft to a third country.
    
The Brown Amendment does not propose a time limit for this disposal 
neither does it make it binding on the US to refund the money in any 
particular time frame.
    
Analysts said the acceptance of the cheque by Pakistan marked closing of 
the option to take the US to the court to get the full refund of F-16 
aircraft along with interest.
    
The Embassy Press release, however, said discussions were continuing 
between the two sides for the full reimbursement of the entire amount of 
$658 million paid by Pakistan.
    
Defence experts said the amount paid to Pakistan on Tuesday was the 
excess payments Pakistan had made for goods which were neither ordered 
nor manufactured and this amount was lying in a separate account for 
which the Administration did not need Congressional approval to repay.
    
But if the Administration wanted to meet the shortfall in the sale price 
of the F-16 aircraft to a third country, Congressional appropriation 
would be necessary and the Administration is not very keen to seek such 
a approval during an election year.

<a name="raph">Raphel hints at arms embargo on Afghanistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 21: Stepping up an intense diplomatic effort to end 
factional fighting in Afghanistan, US Assistant Secretary of State Robin 
Raphel gave strong indications here on Sunday of an arms embargo for the 
battle-weary country, a move mooted during a recent UN Security Council 
debate on Afghanistan.
    
By and large most parties I have talked to in Afghanistan are 
interested in the arms embargo and an end to arms from outside 
countries, Raphel told newsmen at the conclusion of her two-day visit 
of Afghanistan where she met President Rabbani and Ahmad Shah Masood 
near Kabul and the Taliban leaders at Kandahar.

Reiterating the US position on Afghanistan she said at the end of the 
day, the Afghan leaders themselves have to sit down and negotiate some 
sort of a formula which is acceptable to all. We are not going to impose 
a formula on them. But I think through our diplomatic urgings, efforts 
to co-ordinate with outside powers, we can hopefully help focus the 
minds of the parties inside Afghanistan.
    
Referring to outside interference by interested neighbours, she said: 
Everywhere I went I heard outside interference is the problem. In Kabul 
they were referring to the Pakistan support of the Taliban, in Kandahar 
they were referring to Iranian, Russian and Indian support for Kabul.
    
While maintaining that the US has no specific proposals for 
Afghanistan, nor would it play a mediatory role, Ms Raphel conceded 
there were indeed elements at play that had caused Americans to look 
again at Afghanistan with heightened interest. She apprehended a major 
battle over Kabul. It was for this purpose that she was undertaking a 
trip to Ashkabad, Tashkent and later to Moscow.
    
She said the humanitarian concern in the war-ravaged country and the 
development of economic potential in the region have heightened the US 
interest in Afghanistan.

<a name="nasi">Nasir Aslam sworn in CJ denies any govt pressure</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 18: Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid took oath as a permanent 
judge of the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah 
described the event as a step towards the implementation of the SC 
verdict.
    
The President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Akram Sheikh, a 
Muslim League lawyer, termed the appointment of Justice Nasir Aslam to 
the Supreme Court illegal, asserting that being the most senior judge he 
should have been appointed chief justice of the Sindh High Court under 
the SC judgement instead of Justice Mamoon Qazi.

When his attention was drawn to a reported statement by Akram Sheikh 
alleging that the government was pressuring him for an agreement and to 
administer the oath to the newly-appointed judge, he said: Neither 
there has been any agreement nor I am the kind of a person who can be 
pressured.
    
Asked whether the appointment of Justice Mamoon Kazi as the SHC chief 
justice was in line with the Supreme Court decision verdict, he said the 
appointment was all right as Justice Nasir Aslam had taken oath as a 
permanent judge of the apex court.
    
Justice Sajjad Ali said the next step in the implementation of the apex 
courts judgement would be regularisation of the ad hoc judges in the 
high courts.

<a name="mqmr">MQM rebel forms party</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 20: Sindh minister for health and a former MQM leader, 
Shamim Ahmed, launched his own party which he said would work for peace, 
political stability and national prosperity. The National Unity Party, 
he said at a news conference, would not work as a B-team of any party. 
It would represent the 60 per cent voters who did not take part in the 
electoral process. These people, he said, would be mobilised to 
participate in elections so that a truly representative government could 
be set up in the country.

About the manifesto of his party, the rebel MQM leader said it would 
distribute 70 million acres of state land at a rate of 25 acres per 
family, and set up committees of industrialists and traders to promote 
industrial and economic activities in the country.
    
Mr Shamim said the partys organisational work would be completed within 
a month. He nominated Abdul Munam Khan as president of the manifesto 
committee while Syed Aftab Husain will work as president of the labour 
wing.
    
To a question, he said he quit the MQM on account of its anti-state 
activities. He said he had contacted the government to apprise it of the 
actual designs of MQM and not for the sake of ministry. His offer was 
unconditional, however, the government asked him to join cabinet as in 
this way he could serve his voters in better manner.
    
Mr Shamim said every Pakistani was perturbed over the situation in the 
country, specially in Karachi. He suggested that government should 
release people involved in minor cases.

<a name="opfa">OPF approves four housing programmes</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 20: The Board of Directors of the Overseas Pakistanis 
Foundation (OPF) has approved four major housing and welfare schemes 
estimated to cost one billion dollars. We are about to launch major 
housing schemes in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi for Pakistanis living 
abroad along with a pension scheme, said Mr Shahid Nawaz, the Managing 
Director of the OPF.
    
In an interview to  Dawn  here on Saturday he said the board meeting, 
held on Wednesday, had approved these schemes to be completed in about 
three to four years time. We are not seeking a single penny from the 
government for these projects, but building them with our own 
resources, he added.
    
Giving the details, he said the Islamabad project, to be called the OPF 
valley, had just been undertaken. Also, we will be constructing a 15-
storeyed building for overseas Pakistanis in the Capital, he said, 
adding that the two projects would cost 300 million dollars.
 
The building would have 1,000 flats with all the modern facilities. The 
OPF has acquired 10,000 kanal of land in Zone-5 of Islamabad and in E-11 
sector. The design and concept of the building was prepared by a French 
architect, who has won a Nobel prize.
    
Housing schemes in Lahore and in Karachi would cost about 300 million 
dollars each.
    
The Lahore scheme, to be started in Gulberg, would have 250 flats. Land 
is being acquired in Karachi to start a similar project shortly.
    
He said that a summer housing scheme in Murree would be begun soon for 
overseas Pakistanis.
    
Answering a question, Shahid Nawaz said that the OPF was a non- 
profitable organisation, and it was mainly run by the membership of 
Rs1,500 by each Pakistani living abroad. We have a lot of funds to 
initiate various development schemes for our members.
    
Asked how would the OPF generate funds to the tune of one billion 
dollars, the managing director said his organisation had invested money 
in different public sector schemes. These schemes are giving us good 
profit to undertake projects of such magnitude, the OPF chief said.
    
To a question, Shahid Nawaz said that a pension scheme had just been 
launched for the welfare of the overseas Pakistanis. It was launched 
after conducting all spade work and keeping in view their interests.

He said boys schools would be constructed in Islamabad. Later, a boys 
college will be set up in Mirpur, Azad Kashmir.

Also, a new pilot project in the health sector would be started either 
in Gujrat or in Kharian where many families of the overseas Pakistanis 
lived. We are currently negotiating with a French firm to set up a 
hospital which will cost seven million dollars, he said.

<a name="wapd">WAPDA tops list of six corrupt departments</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 20: Six government departments top the list in 
inefficiency, corruption and in carrying administrative excesses, 
according to Wafaqi Mohtasibs (Ombudsman) annual report for 1995.
    
People are hostage to the inefficiency of WAPDA, PTC, Sui Gas, Railways, 
Finance and Education departments and complaints made to the Wafaqi 
Mohtasib indicate neglect, delay and inefficiency of these departments, 
says the 1995 report which Wafaqi Mohtasib Justice (retd) Abdul Shakurul 
Islam presented to the President last month.
    
There is no dearth of favouritism, discrimination, departure from law, 
rules or regulations, unjust and irrational decisions and administrative 
excesses, the retired judge remarked in his report.
 
He said though most of these departments were earning money from the 
common citizens but the latter was hostage to the inefficiency and 
criminal negligence.
    
Among these six departments, WAPDA again tops in inefficiency followed 
by PTC, Finance, Sui gas, Railways and Education.
    
According to the annual report a total of 33,175 complaints were 
received by the Wafaqi Mohtasib during 1995 and 88 per cent of these 
complaints were against these six departments.

ISLAMABAD, April 23: Rangers have been made into a separate department 
in Sindh and they will remain posted in the province permanently to 
reinforce steps for controlling the law and order situation, Senate was 
told.
    
Stating this in reply to a supplementary question by Senator Ishtiaq 
Azhar during Question Hour, state minister for special education Dr Sher 
Afgan speaking on behalf of the interior minister Naseerullah Babar told 
the House that the decision had been made at the request of the Sindh 
government.
    
The senator had sought information about a three-month extension to 
rangers deployment in Sindh. The minister said:  Since one of the 
functions of the Pakistan rangers is to reinforce the police for 
maintenance of law and order wherever it is necessary, the force has, 
therefore, been deployed in that province on the request of the 
provincial government and will continue till their deployment is 
considered necessary by the government of Sindh.

Our Correspondent

RAWALPINDI, April 22: The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Sajjad Ali 
Shah, was discharged from the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology 
(AFIC) after remaining in the hospital for five days.
    
AFIC chief Major General Mohammad Yousuf told Dawn that the Chief 
Justice was allowed to leave the hospital after his final examination 
early in the morning.
    
General Yousuf, who is also commandant and executive director of the 
AFIC and National Institute of Heart Diseases, said: We have advised 
the Chief Justice to visit the hospital for medical examination after 
Eid-ul-Azha.
    
We have also advised Chief Justice Sajjad to take complete rest for 
about a week before returning to normal work, he added.
    
Justice Sajjad was rushed to the AFIC on Thursday after he developed 
some heart problem. He had his heart bypass in 1984. The Chief Justice 
complained pressure on his chest after his return home from the oath-
taking ceremony of Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid as a judge of the Supreme 
Court.

<a name="kard">Kardar passes away</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 21: Cricketer, politician, educationist, diplomat and 
social activist Abdul Hafeez Kardar died here. He was found dead in his 
room in the morning and had apparently suffered a heart attack while 
asleep. Kardar, who was 71, had been a heart patient for a long time and 
was taken ill again during a recent visit to Britain. But he had 
recovered and sounded cheerful on his return to Lahore early this month.
    
He was laid to rest in the Miani Sahib graveyard in the presence of 
hundreds of mourners drawn from all walks of life. His funeral prayer, 
offered in the courtyard of his residence in Gulberg, was led by former 
Test cricketer S. F. Rehman. Many Test cricketers, former cricket 
officials, bureaucrats, journalists  and  a  large number of  his 
 admirers  attended the funeral prayers.

Despite the ill health that lately plagued him, he was always ready to 
contribute to a good cause and lend the weight of his presence to 
seminars and discussions on social and economic problems. 
    
He was elected an MPA in the 1970 elections on the Peoples Party 
ticket, later becoming Punjabs minister of education. He was also 
educational adviser for some time and had been sent by late prime  
minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to take part in negotiations with Sheikh 
Mujibur Rahman before the traumatic separation of East Pakistan.
   
His differences with the PPP leadership, which had started fairly early 
on, had finally led to a parting of ways before the 1977 elections. 
Before entering public life, he had worked as an executive for an oil 
company.

<a name="edhi">Edhi finalising will</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 24: Social worker Sattar Edhi has been finalising his 
will with his family members for the functioning of his trust, which 
will be looked after by a caretaker committee after his death.
    
Speaking to Dawn, the Maulana said he was making necessary changes in 
his will, he had with him for the last six years, with the consultation 
of his wife Bilquis, sons Qutub 24, Faisal, 22, daughters Kubra, 26, and 
Almas, 22.
    
According to him, the trust at present is valued at Rs 3 billion and the 
liquid assets also run into millions of rupees. He said he had set a 
target for himself to collect Rs 1 bn by 2003  the year when the 
valuation of property would be nearly doubled. The amount collected by 
the target date, he said, would be converted into Defence Saving 
Certificates.
    
The committee, he said, would comprise the sitting chief justices of the 
Supreme Court and the four high courts, the sitting Chief of the Army 
Staff, the governor of the State Bank, the chairman of the Board of 
Revenue, his family members and a few individuals he did not want to 
name.
    
The Maulana said he had not taken or nominated any politician or 
religious figure as a matter of choice, adding: It is and it will be a 
very huge financial proposition, which needs men having desirable 
experience to run the trust.
    
At present the members of the Edhi Welfare Trust, registered in 1983, 
are only Maulana Edhi himself and his wife Bilquis Edhi.
    
Asked whether he had been submitting annual and audit reports of his 
trust to the relevant office annually, Maulana Edhi said he had never 
faltered even for once and the exemption of taxes and other levies was a 
result of the obligation he had been fulfilling throughout.
    
Answering a question, he said he had suggested eight areas of activities 
for the caretaker committee for welfare work, which included ambulance 
service, homes for the destitute, rehabilitation centres, social 
programmes aimed at providing financial assistance to women for setting 
up industrial homes, cradles where unwanted babies could be taken care 
of and a hostel for the shelterless children.

Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 24: Pakistan slips into the Eid holidays from Friday in 
what in the case of some institutions might turn out to be a nine-day 
shutdown.
    
Saturday is a closed day for the government as well as for banks and 
most educational institutions, and April 28, 29 and 30 have been 
declared as Eid holidays. May 1  May Day  is a gazetted holiday, so 
that adds up to six days.
    
The day after May Day is Thursday when banks will open and so will 
government offices, but it requires no great prescience to say that 
there will hardly be any attendance on that day. This will be followed 
by the May 3-4 weekend, and so one can hope to get back to some 
semblance of normal working only on May 5.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="aidc">Aid Club pledges : $2.4bn for next year</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Athar Ali

LONDON, April 23: The Aid to Pakistan Consortium on Tuesday pledged 2.4 
billion dollars to Pakistan for the next year at its annual meeting held 
in Paris. The meeting began on Monday.
    
On the conclusion of the meeting an announcement about the pledge was 
made.
    
According to the World Bank sources, the amount pledged is approximately 
what Pakistan had asked for. The request was for 2.67 billion dollars.
    
The donor countries discussed Pakistans overall economic programme and 
prospects and efforts at poverty reduction in the country. The six-
member Pakistan team was led by Mr V A Jafarey, Special advisor to the 
prime minister for financial affairs and included representatives of the 
Finance and Economic Divisions, the Pakistan Investment Board, the 
Planning Commission and social sector development.
 
The donors, according to informed sources, gave a two-part response to 
Pakistans development efforts. They anticipate that in accordance with 
the Governments commitment reforms will continue.
    
If the reform momentum slows, the donor support is likely to be lower 
than in the current year. While noting the slower pace of structural 
reforms implemented in the 1995-96 budget, and the resulting macro 
imbalances of last fall, the donors commended the government for the 
stabilisation measures introduced last October.
    
They said since that time economic growth has revived and inflation has 
reduced, helped by the recovery of agricultural production.
    
Donors representatives are said to have emphasised that Pakistan still 
faces a chronic fiscal problem and narrow export base. While the current 
account deficit is expected to approach 3 billion dollars in the present 
year, the meeting also took note of recent recovery in exports.
    
The need for further improving the social sector was emphasised at the 
meeting by donor countries. Their representatives said that though 
Pakistans social indicators have been improving they are still much 
below averages for countries in similar income levels.
    
The Government was urged in the strongest terms to follow through with 
the programme of stabilisation and structural reform begun last October. 
The Pakistan delegation is said to have confirmed the governments 
intention in the 1996-97 budget to adhere to this path, treating the 
current Standby Agreement with the IMF as a stepping stone to a possible 
multi-year ESAF agreement.
    
The donors in particular urged the government to restructure 
expenditures, continue restraint on defence expenditures, use 
privatisation proceeds to retire high-cost government debts, and broaden 
the tax base. Further trade reform was considered a key aspect of the 
fiscal adjustment required.
    
With regard to the defence expenditure, the delegation stressed that 
further cuts in defence spending could only take place in the context of 
improvements in the regional security situation

The donors stressed the importance of reducing poverty by generating 
employment through micro-credit, attention to the informal sector, and 
reform of the agriculture sector.
    
There was also broad support for the Social Action Programme, Pakistans 
primary effort to expand access to and strengthen basic education, 
primary health, family planning and rural water supply.
    
In the field of investment there was a general consensus that the 
overall climate for both domestic and foreign investment has 
substantially improved. But the participants identified a number of 
areas where they saw room for improvement.

<a name="dire">Direct foreign investment to reach $800m this fiscal</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 24: Direct foreign investment in Pakistan is expected 
to total 800 million dollars this financial year   as compared with 
about 200 million dollars in 1989, according to World Bank estimates.
    
Meanwhile, reports reaching here from Paris about the two-day Aid-to-
Pakistan Consortium said that the conference provided an opportunity for 
about 30 Pakistani and international businessmen to discuss the factors 
which would affect the quality and volume of private investment in 
Pakistan.
    
A World Bank press release said that the businessmen agreed that 
macroeconomic adjustment was essential for a more lively economy.
    
In this context, it was further agreed that reducing the fiscal deficit 
would reduce government crowding out of private sector investment, as 
well as improve the countrys creditworthiness for commercial borrowings 
and reduce Pakistans borrowing costs. It would also contribute toward a 
more export-oriented trade policy through reduction of import tariffs.
    
Participants also noted the need for consistency and clarity in the 
details of implementation especially of tax reform. The participants 
welcomed the commitment by top level government officials to these 
objectives, and encouraged the government to adopt clear, comprehensive 
and co-ordinated policies and to step up efforts to foster their 
efficient implementation by the bureaucracy.
    
Participants also identified a number of bottlenecks to increased 
competitiveness. These include infrastructure, especially port 
facilities and railways, the high cost of dealing with an unresponsive 
bureaucracy, labour productivity, and the high cost of capital.

<a name="unit">United Bank to have professional directors</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, April 21: There will be no official of the finance ministry or 
the Banking Council (PBC) on the board of directors of the United Bank, 
now being reconstituted by the State Bank (SBP) after its take over on 
Saturday, in which Dr Mohammad Yaqub announced the appointment of M.R. 
Khan as chairman of the board and Shafi Arshad as the new President and 
Chief Executive.
    
Formation of the UBL board of directors will be completed in the next 
one or two days, Mr Khan and Mr Arshad told Dawn after meeting the SBP 
governor, Mr Yaqub. They indicated that the board might have seven or 
even more directors but all of them would be professionals.
    
The nationalised commercial banks have three serving executives as 
directors besides one nominee each from the finance ministry and the 
Banking Council and two politicians nominated by the present government 
on their respective boards, but all indications are that the UBL would 
have a board entirely comprising professionals.
    
We intend to take short-term, medium-term and long-term measures for 
the consolidation of the UBL, Mr Khan said and termed the falling 
liquidity ratio of the bank a pressing issue. He was, however, confident 
of tackling this problem with certain measures which would build up 
confidence of the depositors and motivate the staff who now appeared to 
be somewhat demoralised.
    
Most of the bankers believe that the tough job that lay ahead of the new 
management team is to deal with overstaffing. They quote the former 
president of the bank, Azizullah Memon, now a member of the Banking 
Council, who in an official meeting had proposed to the government to 
close down the uneconomical branches and offer a golden handshake to the 
employees willing to retire.
    
During a meeting about two years ago, Mr Memon had observed that 70 per 
cent of the officers were those who had started their career as clerks. 
Such officers are not only weak in English, they also lack conceptual 
clarity and insight, the former UBL president had observed then and 
suggested to the government to spend Rs350 million in golden handshake 
which in his view then would have resulted in an annual saving of Rs600 
million over a period of five years.
    
A day after the top level changes in the UBL on Sunday, bankers did not 
report any unusual rush on any branch of the bank. Sunday is the first 
working day of the week after two off days and every bank witnesses 
relatively larger number of clients, explained a senior executive of 
the UBL who said like all other banks, the UBL branches too were a 
little more busy. But there were clients with deposits as well as with 
cheques to draw from their accounts, he said.

<a name="real">Real exchange rate estimated to be Rs 35 against $</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, April 22: The real effective exchange rate (REER) of the 
rupee has been estimated by international investment consultants (IICs) 
to be around Rs 35 to a dollar presently and they do not expect it to 
depreciate below this level over the next three months.
    
According to these IICs, State Bank of Pakistans exchange rate policy 
was being guided by its commitment to maintain the Pakistan exchange 
rate at an internationally competitive level so as to encourage 
exports.
    
One major international investment consultant, Crosby which now has its 
branch offices in Pakistan has asserted in its latest country spotlight 
on Pakistan (April 18, 1996) that its January, 1996 forecast that the 
beneficial impact of a rupee devaluation in October 1995 and a better 
cotton crop would come through in March has been proved correct.
    
However, an unexpected surge in imports overshadowed the improvement on 
the export front but the governments response by way of further 1.2 per 
cent rupee depreciation since January, 1996, which is also in line with 
our forecast, is a positive step towards bettering the external sectors 
macroeconomic balance. maintained the spotlight report.
    
Crosby said Pakistans March exports of 844 million were 17.5 per cent 
higher than Februarys and 24 per cent above March 1995. Cumulative 
exports in July 1995-March 1996 grew 4.9 per cent to 5.9 billion dollars 
over the same period last year.
    
Crosbys analysis says that the exports have risen steeply since 
January, 1996 due to an improved cotton crop in 1995-96 (estimated at 
10.2 million bales against 8.7 million bales in 1994-95) now being 
translated into higher cotton-related exports.
    
Raw cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton fabric exports were the fastest 
export categories during the first nine months, recording a combined 
growth of 24 per cent to hit 2.2 6 billion dollars.
    
The 1995 cotton exports liberalisation, which had previously been 
deterred by licensing controls and a 15 per cent exports surcharge to 
ensure cheap supplies to domestic textile industries, resulting in raw 
cotton exports of 2.4 million bales estimated at 800 million dollars 
since January has also been identified by Crosby as one of reasons for 
export boom.
    
Crosby further said that more credit was available to the textile 
industry when last Septembers textile sector package eased banks bad 
debt problems arising from the cotton shortage and its adverse impact.
    
The international investment consultants also estimate that the positive 
impact on exports of the rupees 7 per cent devaluation on October 28, 
1995 and the subsequent 1.2 per cent had begun to come through with a 
four month lag.
    
According to the spotlight report, a surprising development in March, 
1996 was a spike in the monthly value of imports to a level last seen in 
June 1995. This was despite a 10 per cent import duty surcharge imposed 
in October 1995 in addition to 7 per cent currency devaluation.
    
The major import categories showing growth in March were machinery, 
chemicals, petroleum and wheat. Machinerys imports were probably the 
beneficiaries of the textile sectors better industrial capacity 
utilisation and a rebound in consumer confidence, Crosby maintained.
    
Higher chemical imports are feeding the greater use of 
fertilisers/pesticides in the agriculture sector, while petroleum 
consumption rose with the installation of new thermal power generating 
units. Wheat imports have risen due to a smaller crop this year, the 
report further said.
    
The implications, according to the international investment consultant, 
is that imports of price-inelastic goods have increased: those that are 
production-related do not pose a serious balance of payments problem 
since the pick-up in exports will correspondingly be robust, however, 
the 18 per cent import growth during July 1995-March 1996 led to the 
trade deficit widening to 2.69 billion dollars from 1.63 billion dollars 
for the same period in 1994-95.
    
Since mid-95, the trade deficit, worsened primarily by lower cotton-
related exports, saw foreign exchange reserves being depleted to just 
over 1 billion in late 1995, but since then, the reserves have risen to 
1.7 billion dollars currently, sufficient to finance 1.5 months imports.

LAHORE, April 21: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said here that nine of 
the power projects for which MoUs were signed by her government had met 
financial close. This, she said, indicated the success of the 
governments economic policies.
    
During her speech, the prime minister said investment in the petroleum 
sector had increased by 500 per cent.  She also mentioned various steps 
taken for the welfare of the people. 
   
Ms Bhutto said that with the ground-breaking ceremony at Raiwind, 
another MoU had been turned into a project which would provide job 
opportunities for the people. She said the present government had 
returned loans to the tune of $1 billion, reduced domestic borrowing and 
the rate of commercial loans and brought down inflation from 13 per cent 
to nine per cent. The growth rate had increased to six per cent.
    
In a welcome address, Southern Electric Power Company president Ali 
Mahmood said the $119 million project in Raiwind was being set up in 
collaboration with Canadas BC Hydro Power Company Limited. He said 
foreign investors recognised that Pakistan offered outstanding 
investment opportunities.

KARACHI, April 23: The Trade Marks Registry of Pakistan has sought 
private sector views and suggestions for bringing in suitable amendments 
in the Trade Mark Act, 1940, to meet the GATT conditions agreed upon by 
the Government of Pakistan.
    
The government has entered into GATT Agreement according to which 
Pakistan was required to amend its Trade Marks law to bring it in 
conformity with TRIPS Agreement within a period of five year but before 
year 2000.

<a name="stee">Steep rise in power tariff indicated</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, April 24: The cost to the final consumer of the electricity 
that would be bought at 6.65 US cents (Rs2.29 at the current official 
rate of exchange) a unit by WAPDA from the private power stations now 
being set up, would be around 10 US cents or Rs3.45,estimates a study 
prepared by a government department.
    
The almost doubling of the final cost of private power at the 
consumption stage is attributed mainly to the transmission and 
distribution expenses made heavier because of the long distances the 
networking systems have to cover, the study further said.
    
The main argument in favour of setting up private thermal power stations 
producing costly electricity is that the wheels of countrys economy 
would grind to a halt if by the year 2000 we do not add at least 3000mw 
of additional power generating capacity to the national grid.
    

The proponents of power at any cost point out that even 10 cents a unit 
would look cheaper when considered against the cost of having the 
economy come to a standstill.
    
They further argue that with the addition of adequate generating 
capacity within a matter of few years domestic economic activities would 
be accelerated enough to generate sufficient resources to more than pay 
for the high cost of private thermal power.
    
However, the official study points out that since only the domestic 
consumer gets subsidised electricity and the industrial and commercial 
consumers pay very high tariffs, the expectation that the additional 
generating capacity, whatever its cost to the end-consumer, would 
accelerate the domestic economic activity was misplaced.
    
The ever increasing cost of power to industrial and commercial consumers 
has already forced many of them to make arrangements for in-house 
generation, the study points out and says the relatively high cost of 
energy would also price Pakistan exports goods out of the world market.
    
In this connection, it notes that in most other countries the cost of 
energy to industrial and commercial consumers is much lower than that 
for the domestic consumer. This is not so because of any subsidy but 
because the cost of transmitting power in bulk to a single consumer is 
much less per unit than the cost for taking it to smaller domestic 
consumers each of whom has to have separate individual meters and there 
are millions of independent lines cascading from the thousands of 
transmitters tumbling out of the national grid.
    
In India, too, industrial and commercial consumers pay less than what 
domestic consumers do on account of this very reason and that is why the 
cost of production of competing export goods in India is much less than 
in Pakistan.
    
The study maintains that providing high-cost private thermal electricity 
to domestic consumers at subsidised rates would put a very heavy burden 
on the budget and render unavailing the entire exercise of having the 
private sector quickly fill a crucial part of the widening gap between 
supply and demand of power. 
    
The study observes that the government could not reverse this socially 
gratifying but economically very costly policy of charging high from 
industrial and commercial consumers and low from domestic consumers 
overnight to rationalise the national energy development programme.
    
The study advises the government to take a close look at the power 
tariff policies of other countries in comparable development stage, 
specially those of Pakistans closest competitors in the export markets, 
and start bringing about suitable changes at this juncture in its tenure 
when the elections are still two years away.

<a name="stat">State Bank gets tough on financial indiscipline</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 23: The governor of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Dr 
Muhammad Yaqub asked the senior executives of Habib Bank Ltd (HBL) to 
raise the level of financial discipline and accountability at HBL and 
refrain from imprudent lending.
    
Sources at the HBL said the SBP chief met a five-member HBL team led by 
its president Younus Dalia and conveyed to them his concern on high 
administrative cost of nationalised commercial banks (NCBs) including 
HBL and the low level of financial discipline and accountability. They 
said, he urged, the HBL executives to ensure quick recovery of stuck-up 
loans and keep an eye over the expansion of loan portfolio.
    
No word was available from the SBP on the proceedings of the meeting. 
Attempts to contact Governor Yaqub on telephone also proved futile.
    
The SBP has apparently launched a campaign to correct erring banks and 
DFIs and Governor Dr Yaqub has already held a series of meetings with 
top bankers in this regard. The chief executives of three NCBs and four 
government-run DFIs are also scheduled to call on him on Wednesday. The 
meeting has been convened to convey the same message to all NCBs and 
DFIs.
    
The SBP has lately been engaged in developing a performance evaluation 
format for the senior bankers so that the same may be used as a tool to 
enhance performance of the banks and DFIs and to initiate actions 
against the erring and corrupt officials.

<a name="$382">$382 million contract goes to US firms</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, April 23: A 382 million dollar contract has been awarded to 
two American companies for the worlds largest barge- mounted power 
plant to be set up at Port Qasim in Karachi, the two companies 
officially announced in Lexington, Massachusetts on Monday.
    
A consortium of Raytheon Engineers & Constructors and Westinghouse has 
got the contract for the 450 megawatt plant in collaboration with WAK 
Orient Power & Light Limited, sponsors of Pakistans WAK Gas, a company 
owned by Senator Gulzar and his son, Senator Waqar, both of the ruling 
PPP.
    
Raytheon will provide turnkey engineering, procurement, and construction 
services. This will include fabricating barges, installing power plant 
equipment, shipping the barges to Port Qasim, and testing and 
commissioning the equipment, the announcement said.
    
Westinghouse will supply six 50-megawatt Model 251B11 combustion 
turbines, three steam turbine-generators, six heat recovery steam 
generators, and a Westinghouse WDPF Distributed Control System (DCS).
    
The combustion and steam turbine-generators will be manufactured in 
Westinghouses North American factories. Westinghouse also will supply 
operation and maintenance services for 12 years under a separate 
contract.
 
Each companys share of the contract is approximately equal.
    
The 450 megawatt power plant, believed to be the largest ever mounted on 
a barge, will actually consist of six barges, with three having two gas 
turbines each and the other three barges having one steam turbine each.

<a name="ksei">KSE index posts fresh gain of 14.42 points</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, April 24: The recovery trend on the stock market was well-
sustained on Wednesday as follow-up support figured prominently on 
selected counters aided chiefly by news of Consortium aid pledge of 
$2.4bn.
    
The optimism generated by the aid pledge of the donor countries was 
further supplemented by news of refund of $124 million, being the first 
instalment of the total dues from the US against the cost of F-16 
aircraft.
    
The KSE 100-share index, therefore, posted a fresh gain of 14.42 points 
at 1,556.29 as compared to 1,541.87 on Tuesday, reflecting the relative 
strength of the base shares.
    
The buying support, however, remained largely selective as investors 
were not in a mood to go beyond the safe havens apparently because of a 
long weekend on account of Eid holidays.
    
Analysts said the aid pledge of $2.4b is expected to play a pivotal role 
in putting the market back on a solid footing as it demonstrates the 
confidence of donors in Pakistans economic growth potential.
    
Another important factor is that the aid pledge could open the way for 
fresh US private sector investment in new sectors other than the energy 
one, they added.
    
Big gainers were led by Fateh Textiles and Dawood Hercules, which rose 
by Rs 9 and 10. It was interesting to note that Dawood Hercules has 
posted gain of Rs 10 for the second session in a row after early weeks 
decline apparently on news of higher interim.
    
It is daily narrowing the gap between its ruling price and that of the 
Engro Chemical as the difference is now only of Rs 5. Some weeks back 
Engro was sharply quoted higher than Dawood Hercules.
    
PSO, led the list of other good gainers, rising by Rs 3 followed by 
Business and General Insurance, Central Insurance, Engro Chemicals, MCB, 
Adamjee Insurance and United Distributors, which rose by Rs 1.25 to 3.
    
Soneri Bank, Telecard, Indus Motors, Pakistan Services and Burewala and 
Dawood Cotton were among the other leading gainers.
    
Losses were mostly fractional and reflected lack of large selling as 
bears withdrew to the sidelines anticipating further increase in prices.
    
However, Parke-Davis was the leading losers, which fell by Rs 5 but 
without any deals.
    
Other MNCs, which followed it included BOC Pakistan, Pakistan Oilfields, 
Sandoz Pakistan, and SK&F, falling one rupee to Rs 2.
    
Packages, Dadabhoy Sack, Ferozsons, Dewan Sugar, Crescent Sugar, Javed 
Omer, Dewan Textiles and Ittefaq Textiles were among the leading local 
blue chips, which fell modestly.
    
Among the actively traded shares, Hub-Power was again outstanding, up 95 
paisa on 12.523m shares. At one stage it was quoted as higher as Rs 32, 
before finishing slightly lower on late selling.
    
It was followed by PTC vouchers, higher 60 paisa on 12.523m shares, Dhan 
Fibre, steady five paisa on 1.109m shares, Fauji Fertiliser, lower 10 
paisa on 0.549m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by D.G.Khan Cement (right), up 
five paisa on 0.420m shares, followed by Sui Northern, higher 50 paisa 
on 0.178m shares, Lucky Cement, easy five paisa on 0.263m shares and 
D.G.Khan Cement, up 25 paisa on 0.251m shares.
    
Trading volume rose further to 30 m shares from the overnight 26.650m 
shares thanks to active short-covering in most of the bank shares.
    
There were 335 actives, which came in for trading, out of which 139 
shares fell, while 124 rose, with 72 holding on to the last levels.

THOSE who kill or maim their fellow human beings at the bidding of 
others  for vengeance, for political gain or for money  such as the 
men of our so-called agencies, those who blow up hospitals or places 
of learning, are to my mind the scum of the earth.
    
On April 14, a bomb planted at Imrans Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer 
Hospital at Lahore exploded. The count so far: seven dead, three 
critically wounded, many more under treatment. The damage is estimated 
to be in the region of Rs 50 million. Unassessed is the fallout, and 
many more will suffer for want of treatment and the hospitals inability 
to provide it.
    
Prime Minister Bhutto stopped doing what it was she was doing in 
Peshawar that day, boarded the peoples plane, and rushed to Lahore. Big 
deal! She arrived at the hospital, said the right and the wrong things. 
She asked how it could be presumed that she and her party would take on 
Imran. He is not a politician. He is no danger, no threat, they have no 
reason to blow him up.
    
Whatever Benazir may say, the fact remains that Imran and his hospital 
are being targeted and harassed. What the people give Imran, they give 
voluntarily. He does not extort and this irks our professional 
extortionists and their slimy supporting contortionists.
    
Imran wanted time on television to advertise his hospital and raise 
donations, and he offered to pay, as do the Colas and others. But the 
government said NO. Why?
    
Nawazs government had sanctioned payment of Rs 5 million a year to the 
hospital from the Zakat Fund. This government has rescinded the 
sanction. Why?
    
Cases have been filed in our courts against Imran, accusing him of 
illegally or unauthorisedly collecting funds, not accounting for them, 
misusing them, etc. Why? The people are well aware that these are all 
trumped up charges, that those who have levelled them, are toadies who 
have been thanked and well rewarded. It is an old story.
    
Now we go back 21 years to a place of learning, to the Peshawar 
University, to that fateful Saturday, February 8, 1975. Whilst 
addressing the students, a good man Hayat Mohammed Khan Sherpao, senior 
minister of the NWFP and president of the provincial PPP, was blown up 
by a bomb and killed. Another Prime Minister Bhutto, Zulfikar that time, 
stopped doing what he was doing in New York that day, boarded the plane, 
flew back, and wept at Sherpaos grave.
    
The very next day, on February 9, the leaders of the opposition NAP in 
various parts of the country were arrested. These included Wali Khan, 
Arbab Sikander, Qaswar Gardezi, Mehroz Akhtar, Arbab Saifur Rahman, 
Major General M.G. Jilani (Jil of Narowal), Amirzada Khan, Haji Ghulam 
Ahmed Bilour, Mohammed Adil, Rukhnuddin Kazmi, Hassan Hameedi, 
Rehmatullah Khan Rohaila, Abdul Khaliq Khan (Roedads brother, the best 
of the lot). They were held under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) 
ordinance and various other false charges.
    
Barrister Azizullah Shaikh, chief of the NAP in Karachi, who was in 
Hyderabad, managed to remain out of reach. His home, with his wife and 
three small daughters, was surrounded by agency men, it was pelted with 
stones, and the children terrorised. Friend Sardar Sherbaz Mazari moved 
in with his own armed bodyguards and stayed overnight to protect 
Azizullahs family.
    
On February 10, the government of Pakistan dissolved the National Awami 
Party and forfeited all the properties and funds of the Party. The 
action, according to Gazette of Pakistan notifications, has been taken 
under Sub-section 1 of Section VI of the Political Parties Act of 1962. 
The notifications said that the government was satisfied that the NAP 
was operating in a manner prejudicial to the sovereignty and integrity 
of Pakistan and it had, therefore, formally declared the NAP to be 
operating in such a manner. Following the government order, all the 
offices of the Party throughout the country have been sealed. (Dawn 
Feb. 11, 1975).
    
The movement of scores of other office-bearers of the NAP in various 
centres of the country were restricted under the dreaded MPO. On the 
same day government agents raided and ransacked the offices of Asghar 
Khans Tehrik-i-Istiqlal and of the Jamaat. The office of the defunct 
daily newspaper Shahbaz was set afire.
    
On February 14, the champion of liberty, Minister for Provincial Co-
ordination Hafiz Pirzada declared that the administrative action taken 
by the government in dissolving the National Awami Party was not 
arbitrary or out of rancour and acrimony  it was strictly in conformity 
with the provisions of the Constitution.
    
I now quote from Bhuttos biographer, Stanley Wolpert, the first man 
allowed access to the archives of the great leader at 70 Clifton. He 
had no doubt, moreover, as to the identity of the murderers, though no 
party or individual would ever claim credit for killing Sherpao. Zulfi 
felt as certain that Wali Khan was the man responsible for Sherpaos 
death as Ahmed Raza was certain about who killed his father.
    
Imran may have read his Wisden, but there is no single book that 
will teach him about how politics works in Pakistan. The best he can do 
is to read the three books written by that erudite affable resident of 
Pakistan, Herbert Feldman, dealing with three different periods in the 
countrys history, culminating in the happenings of 1971 when our inept 
politicians lost for us half our country. To gain insight into some of 
the doings of the first of the PPP governments, he could also read the 
editorials written by Iqbal Burney for his Outlook magazine, a 
publication that was eventually banned by Bhutto. The White Papers, 
published by Zia on the various performances of the Bhutto regime, will 
also enlighten him as to the workings of the mind of the third of the 
PPP governments.
    
Having done all this, and still having a stomach for politics in the 
Islamic Republic, he can venture forth knowing where his steps will lead 
him.
    
What Imran must remember is that people are very tired of liars, cheats 
and hypocrites. If he wants to be the prime minister of Pakistan, he 
should admit it. Nothing wrong with that. Ambition is a great asset. 
What he must not drone on about is his fervent desire to serve the 
people and the nation in the larger national interest.
    
The spring and summer of his life he has passed in the West, having 
perfectly normal fun and games, all well earned and all at his own 
expense. He is now home and has brought with him from the West a wife 
who is the pick of the bunch. She is rich, she is well-connected, she is 
young and she is attractive. Now, he badmouths the West that gave him so 
much enjoyment and calls it decadent. Does he really believe that all 
that he finds at home is unadulterated and pure? Employing old cliches 
to advance oneself is not on. Neither is befooling the people.
    
He has much going in his favour. He is well known in Pakistan, and in 
the West, which is a great plus. He has a rich and famous father-in-law 
who knows all about politicians, who can get him to John Major, to 
Chirac, to Kohl, into any room at the top, who can also swing the 
powerful American lobby. Following the usual practice, the few 
obstinates at home could be bought over. That is, providing that 
Goldsmith considers Pakistan to be worth his while.
    
But first things first. The bomb damage has to be repaired, the hospital 
rebuilt, the equipment replaced. Imran must get his hospital going as 
fast as possible, and should accept the government money offered by 
Benazir without any qualms of conscience. It is not her money, it is the 
peoples money, and the people will be glad to see it being put to good 
use. They know it will not be robbed, diluted or stashed away.

<a name="howl">How low can we go?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mazdak

EVERY time I think we have finally touched rock-bottom, I discover that 
we have still greater depths to plumb.
    
Around three years ago, when skins of sacrificial animals collected for 
the Edhi Trust were hijacked by the MQM, I thought we as a nation had 
got about as low as it was possible without reverting to complete 
barbarism. I was wrong. Last year, when Sipah-i-Sahaba gunmen mowed down 
several people praying in a mosque, I was sure things could not possibly 
get any worse. Wrong again: we have now had cancer patients deliberately 
bombed at the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust Hospital in Lahore.
    
One may disagree with Imran Khans wild and woolly ideas, but his 
enormous cricketing talents, and more recently, his single-minded 
dedication to establishing a cancer hospital are beyond controversy. All 
of us dream, but few have the iron resolve needed to translate these 
visions into reality. Imran, to his everlasting credit, has stayed the 
course and delivered on his promise to create a modern cancer hospital. 
No praise is too high for this marvellous achievement, also described by 
some as a modern-day miracle.
    
For this person and this institution to be targeted for a terrorist 
attack is an act more revolting than words can express. Whatever the 
motive, what kind of sick mind could possibly have conceived so vile an 
act? Unfortunately, there is no shortage of possible candidates. There 
is a streak of violence running through our society that makes such 
attacks not just possible, but ultimately acceptable.
    
Closer to the present is the chamber of horrors that Karachi has become. 
Here again, hard-core MQM supporters refuse to accept that members of 
their party have committed the most brutal atrocities against not just 
their opponents, but against wavers within the party as a warning to 
others. Indeed, their ostrich- like attitude and bare-faced hypocrisy is 
similar to the governments refusal to admit the wide prevalence of 
custodial deaths. Here again, an institution of the state stoops to the 
level of urban guerrillas. In both cases, the most brutal acts are met 
not with universal condemnation and swift punitive action against the 
guilty parties, but with denials and lies from one or the other of the 
concerned sides.
    
It is this moral support from their peers that encourages extremists of 
every stripe to resort to terrorism and indiscriminate violence against 
perfectly innocent people. In an intolerant society like ours, dissent 
is equated with treason or heresy. Both are to be punished by death. And 
if the principal target is not easily accessible, then it is perfectly 
acceptable to blow up or gun down as many people as possible to send a 
message.
    
There is a predisposition to violence in this part of the world that is 
hard to reconcile with the teachings of the major religions followed in 
South Asia. Unfortunately, neither our cities nor the countryside are 
immune from violence.
    
Western societies where the rule of law has now taken root were steeped 
in this sort of mindless violence not long ago. Even today, peace in the 
inner cities of America and Europe is often a distant dream. The 
difference is that in much of the Third World, legal deterrence is a 
whimsical process that robs it of all moral authority. The law is loaded 
in favour of those in power and those with money. In any case, the 
police force is created to protect the government of the day, not the 
individual citizen. Under such conditions, the terrorist and the 
criminal feel they can literally get away with murder. Too often, they 
are right.
    
There is often a very thin line between civilisation and barbarism. Push 
the right button and the veneer of law and refinement peels away in a 
flash.
    
Just when we thought the end of the cold war had heralded a Golden Age 
of peace and prosperity, we are faced with the spectre of endless war 
fuelled by intolerance and blind ambition. And as Imran Khan has just 
learned to his cost, even a seemingly praise- worthy activity like 
building a hospital is not without its risks, specially if you are as 
critical as he has been about a corrupt and decaying system.

Omar R. Quraishi

KARACHI, April 21: A visit to the Civic Centre can make your day hell 
for you.
    
You will be confronted by foul smell, dirty paan-infested water, 
fountains that dont work, lifts that youll have to wait 20 minutes to 
get into, peons who will send you to the wrong office at least half a 
dozen times, and their superiors who are about as fast in their work as 
the South American sloth.
    
This reporter had to go for some office work to the Traffic Engineering 
Bureau (TEB). All that needed to be done was to look at some TEB maps 
for the city.
    
The visit to the Centre on Sunday began at 11 in the morning. It seems 
that the government has put up some stiff security measures there 
because you cant enter from the front gate anymore.
    
A side gate where a very old chowkidar  holding a very new state-of-
the-art metal detector, which he had no idea how to use  stands leads 
you inside.
    
To go to the main building you have to pass through what used to be 
(probably a very long time ago) a pond of water. There are fountains 
here but they dont work. The water level, which could be at least three 
feet deep, is perhaps a mere three inches.
    
And its not clean or even clear water. Its muddy brown. But its not 
mud. Its paan, spat out by the many people who walk by this what-used-
to-be-a-pond.
    
As you near the main hall entrance, a foul pungent smell hits your nose; 
so acrid itll disorient you.
    
Once in the main hall, you will find that the serious-looking tough 
metal detector machine doesnt work either, although the three guards 
posted there think it does.
    
A right turn from here lands you to a group of lifts meant to take you 
up in a jiffy. They do anything but that.  Around sixty people were 
waiting in line to get into these lifts. The TEB department is on the 
8th floor. This reporter decided to walk. A bad mistake.
    
Only maps needed to be looked at the TEB office. The director was not 
there. At a meeting he was, his assistant said. Tea was served 
approximately after half an hour of utter time-wasting and looking 
around for the TEB director by his assistant.
    
After another forty-five-minute search for the other official  in 
whose possession the maps were said to be  turned up nothing also, it 
was time to leave and go to the KTC department.
    
It was not easy to go to the KTC department. There were hordes of peons 
around  their only job, it seems is sending citizens to the wrong 
department, and answering simple questions as vaguely as possible. There 
are no signs in this complex of buildings pointing out where any 
department is. Consequently, the peons played their part very well, and 
much time was lost.
    
On, no doubt circuitous, way to the KTC office was found  in what was 
said to be the newly-constructed building  several spots were 
encountered where the benefits of eating, chewing and, of course, 
spitting paan could be seen on the walls.
    
The KTC sahib too was held up in a meeting. One of the union workers 
was complaining that this was a regular feature of work at the Civic 
Centre. The sahibs, he said, are had better things to do than sit in 
office. Thats why they were often in important meetings.
    
This union worker whose office is in Civic Centre had been trying to 
meet a traffic superintendent [whose office also is in Civic Centre] for 
the last one year. But the superintendent was always in a meeting or 
on VIP duty, he said.
    
The visit to the Civic Centre ended at around 2 pm.
    
The maps will have to wait another day.

<a name="blac">Black spots in book industry</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Masud Mufti

THIS write-up is neither a confirmation nor a rebuttal of an article 
which appeared in Dawn (9th April 1996 titled Book Industry in the 
throes). 
   
It only seeks to dispel a wrong impression which, it appears, was 
inadvertently created by the article by mixing the books of Urdu 
literature with other books on politics, religion, history, and culture, 
(illustrations of print run of popular Urdu novels and the writings of 
Mr Mushtaq Ahmad Yusufi have been cited).
    
May be, the rules of game for the two categories are different leading 
to different practices. If so, I am not aware of the conditions about 
other books. My knowledge is limited to the realm of Urdu literature and 
I will strictly confine myself to the production of books on that side 
only. In addition, the topic is being explored here from the point of 
view of an author. Having been once presented with the subject, the 
readers of Dawn should in all fairness be offered the other side of the 
coin also, even if it pertains to a smaller segment of the theme.
    
To give the headlines first, Pakistan is a paradise for the publishers 
of Urdu poetry and fiction. They are not restrained by any law, ethics, 
or morality, and grow rich by misusing this free licence. On the other 
hand the author cannot make his living by his pen because the existing 
law does not provide any safeguards for his rights. It will aggravate 
the prevailing injustice if the publisher gets greater patronage, or 
even sympathy, from the government. On the contrary, there is a strong 
case for the intervention of the government in favour of the author, and 
against the publisher.
    
Permit me to present the full case now by referring to the existing 
legal framework and the living realities. These are diametrically 
opposed to each other.
    
The prevailing laws on the subject appear quite impressive on the paper. 
The Copyright Ordinance 1962, as amended in 1992 and with the rules 
framed in 1967, categorically states that the author of a work shall be 
the first owner of the copyright, (section 13). He can assign it to a 
publisher through a written agreement only (section 15), but the 
copyright automatically reverts to the author after a period of 10 
years. The Registrar of Copyright is required to issue a certificate of 
registration which is the only valid proof of copyright in any judicial 
proceeding. Publishing of more books than agreed between the author and 
the publisher is an infringement of copyright. The offences under this 
law are punishable with imprisonment upto three years and a fine upto 
one lakh rupees (section 66). Relevant judicial forums include a 
Magistrate, Sessions Judge, Copyright Board and the High Court.
    
The foregoing legal jargon sounds very convincing but actually this law 
is like a dog without a bite, because its birth was without teeth. It is 
only a showpiece.
    
There is no linkage of this law with the Registration of Printing Press 
and Publication Ordinance 1989 (section 37) which could enable the 
author to catch some straws in the wind. The author, in short, has 
neither the legal right nor the physical means to check the integrity of 
the publisher. Though offences have been made cognisable and non-
bailable (section 74) yet the author is not in a position to move the 
police or magistrate because the collection of incriminating data is 
beyond his reach due to the total denial of even a slight glimpse of 
publishing operations to him. He cannot build tangible castle in the 
air.
    
Even the administrative infrastructure is very deficient and inadequate. 
The ill-equipped offices of the Registrar in Karachi and Deputy 
Registrar in Lahore have failed so far to make themselves known without 
the network of copyright offices in the country prescribed by law. The 
Copyright Board in Karachi, which should be presided over by a Judge of 
the High Court (section 45) has been having a retired Sessions Judge as 
its head. This limited and downgraded infrastructure operates more as a 
local activity in Karachi than as a national institution across the 
country.
    
This half-baked and crippled legal framework has created strange 
conditions on the ground. The net effect is that the writer, who cannot 
earn his living by his pen, is forced to seek other employments. He 
thus becomes a lesser writer than his potentialities because of the 
compromises he has to make for his primary vocation. Without any legal 
cover his role as a writer is like that of a social orphan as is 
substantiated from the following.
    
The pressure of creativity generates a compulsive urge to create and be 
counted as an author. This weakness is being fully exploited by the 
publishers, who avoid writing a contract with most of the writers, 
charge them a substantial amount as printing cost, and do not pay them 
any royalty from the sale proceeds. In a few cases, there may be a 
written agreement, but that is either for outright purchase of all 
rights (which is against the law of reversion of rights to the author 
after ten years), or for publishing the first edition of 1000 or 500 
copies. Even here the royalty is never paid in most of the cases; and if 
paid to some fortunate exceptions over a long period, it is only for the 
first edition at a rate of around ten per cent, or even much less.
    
This edition is never sold out because the publisher stealthily 
continues to print more and more books as first edition, thereby pushing 
down the proportion paid to the author towards one per cent of total 
sales, or even less. In the absence of any authentic market survey he 
keeps on claiming low sales, conveniently ignoring the large number of 
libraries in and outside the country-wide network of educational 
institutions, individual buyers and exports to foreign countries with 
Urdu- knowing population.
    
A new variant of this exploitation is that the publisher enters into a 
fixed term contract for a few years against some periodic payment to the 
author. During this period the publisher is free to print and sell any 
number of books, and the author never comes to know what percentage of 
total sales he got as royalty. It could be an insignificant fraction. 
The bottom line is that, with few exceptions, the writers either do not 
get even a single penny as royalty; or those who get is far less than 
what they should get.
    
It is quite ironic that, without any income for himself, the authors 
pen is a source of livelihood for at least eight categories of workers: 
(i) calligraphist, (ii) paper merchant, (iii) printing press and its 
staff, (iv) labourer, who transports the printed books to the cart or 
truck, (v) cart or truck owner who moves the books to the publishing 
house, (vi) postal or personnel distribution network, (vii) retail book-
seller and last, but not the least, (viii) the publisher himself, who is 
ready to pay to all other categories except the author. It is tragic 
that all the citizens of Pakistan, who undertake any type of work 
ranging from an unskilled labourer to the chief executive of the 
country, get paid but the writer is the only citizen who works and toils 
without wages. He feeds others but starves himself. This beggar work in 
the 20th century is against all labour conventions and citizens rights.
    
In addition to owning most of the literary magazines in the country, the 
publishers (or their agents) capture the forums which are apparently 
meant to represent the writers, thus depriving them of their voice or 
twisting the demands in their own favour. One has to only look at the 
history of the Pakistan Writers Guild and other similar forums, and the 
grants obtained from Gen. Zia and other rulers by publishers in the name 
of writers. The publisher thus dominates the realm of Urdu literature 
like a wadera in his jagir, who is above law, omnipotent and can pull 
strings against the writers welfare.
    
Another irony of fate is that in our society of extremely low literacy 
rate book business is a highly profitable venture. The books are priced 
higher than in India, and the retail book-seller (who has absolutely no 
input in the production of a book) gets sales commission in the range of 
33 to 40 per cent of the price printed on the book. The entire balance, 
after meeting the publishing cost (about 20 per cent of the highly 
inflated price), is pocketed by the publisher. The author, who is the 
source of this economic activity, either remains dry or gets only a few 
drops of this ocean.
    
This business is so lucrative that the number of publishing houses is 
constantly increasing and is very happily inherited from one generation 
to other to prosper in big houses and mansions. I was not surprised, 
therefore, when a medical doctor-cum-writer told me recently that two of 
his colleagues left the profession and became publishers. Financially, 
they are doing much better than before, he told me, and have ceased to 
be my friends because I am a writer and breathe on the other side of the 
fence.
 
No one in the country is interested in improving the lot of the writers. 
The publishers would not, for obvious reasons. The government would not, 
for hidden designs. Its governing spirit, the feudal mentality, has 
traditionally been anti-education and contemptuous of freedom of 
thought. It has been organising guilds, academies, conventions, and 
seminars to entice the writers and keep them on its side. The writers 
are too divided in seeking patronage from the government to organise 
themselves. This has been in line with the hidden design of the 
successive governments since independence. No wonder this country could 
not produce Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Voltaire, and Rousseau, though 
the socio-political conditions here have been conducive to their 
emergence.
    
If any of the readers thinks that the foregoing account does not depict 
the true legal or physical environment, I will be only too glad to stand 
corrected.

Editorial Column

'THERE could not have been a worse example of the authorities inept and 
callous handling of a matter of utmost public sensitivity and importance 
than the case of the 1,100 distraught Haj pilgrims who have been left 
stranded in Karachi. It was no fault of theirs that they have not been 
able to make it to the holy land this year. It is the Haj Ministry that 
has proved singularly incapable of handling properly a responsibility 
that should be no more than a routine operation every year. The 
authorities have bungled badly and no official explanation is available 
so far as to why nearly 1,100 intending Hajis whose pilgrimage plans had 
been confirmed several months ago were dropped at the eleventh hour. 
They were to leave by different flights from Karachi on April 15-21 but 
were left in the lurch when they arrived at the Haji camp on the date 
stated in their blue cards. Not only were they not issued their visas / 
passports; there was no responsible official at the camp to advise them. 
As a result, there has been a lot of confusion, and heartburning as 
well, as it became plain to the disappointed pilgrims that their dream 
of performing Haj was not to materialise at least not this year.

In the absence of an explanation, one can only guess what could have 
caused the mess-up. It is widely believed that the last-minute inclusion 
of some officially-sponsored people exhausted the quota of visas to 
which Pakistan was entitled (105,000 for Haj this year). Hence, those at 
the tail-end of the notified list of Hajis were unceremoniously dropped. 
This is unpardonable. At least in matters of religious faith one would 
have expected the official functionaries to be honest and scrupulous in 
observing the relevant rules and principles. The dejection of those who 
have been left back can only be imagined. Many of them were people who 
had planned for years, and for them going for Haj was to be an event and 
experience of a lifetime. They 'travelled to Karachi from distant places 
and now feel badly let down and prevented from accomplishing their 
cherished mission for no fault of theirs. The government should' 
intervene even at this late hour, even if it means incurring some extra 
expenses and negotiating with the Saudi Arabian government for extra 
visas. No Haji whose name was there in the original list should be left 
behind.

Irrespective of whether this can be done or not, the government should 
in any case institute an enquiry into the whole distasteful affair. How 
this could have happened and who was responsible for this bungling must 
be investigated. Some heads must roll if some chastening lessons have to 
be driven home. It would also be proper to do some soul-searching about 
the practice of officially-sponsored Haj which seems to be gaining 
currency in Pakistan. Many think the government and business 
organisations use this as a spoils system of sort to win favour with 
those whose goodwill they seek. But one may well ask whether it is right 
for the government l business organisations to pay the Haj expenses of a 
person who is required to perform the rite of Haj only if he is 
financially well off and, that too, after he is through with all his 
basic worldly responsibilities. Is it then right for the government to 
use the taxpayers' money to meet the Haj expenses of another person, 
even the highest dignitary?

<a name="imra">Imrans twists and turns</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Mahir Ali

THE extreme discourtesy with which Imran Khan reacted to Benazir 
Bhuttos visit to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital after it had been 
devastated by a bomb blast last week was, surely, incompatible with the 
high ideals he professes. It suggests that even before his formal entry 
into politics, the ex- cricketer is well versed in the antagonistic 
diatribes that generally substitute for reasoned debate in the Pakistani 
political arena.
    
Had the prime minister not bothered to visit the site of the explosion, 
that would probably have given Imran Khan equal cause for complaint. 
And, although he claims to be non-aligned within the existing political 
context, he was present at the hospital when Nawaz Sharif came calling, 
and even allowed the opposition leader to pledge support for his plans 
(whatever they may be).
    
It is widely being presumed that the hospital bomb was an attempt to 
dampen Imran Khans political ambitions. That may or may not be the 
case, but the tragedy has certainly helped to focus attention on him at 
a critical juncture in his budding political career.
    
What exactly he intends to set up is as yet unclear, much like his 
motives and aims. Will it be a political party, as Press reports almost 
unanimously suggested before the Lahore blast, or a reform movement or 
pressure group as has subsequently been reported? And does the self-
definition matter?
    
The last of these rings a bell. It was a proposed pressure group that 
made Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi see red a little over a year ago, leading 
him briefly to abandon the leadership of his mammoth humanitarian 
operation in Karachi. He revealed little beyond that his life was in 
danger after he had turned down an offer to join a subversive lot to 
destabilise the Benazir Bhutto government, and that Imran Khan was 
somehow involved in it  a charge which, despite its vagueness, the 
former fast bowler has never satisfactorily been able to explain away. 
At the time, Imran Khans association with retired General Hamid Gul 
prompted speculation that the ex-military intelligence chief, notorious 
for his Afghan exploits and an inveterate foe of Ms Bhuttos regime, was 
up to no good. The stigma has not disappeared, and it will be 
interesting to see whether Hamid Gul has an upfront role in the 
forthcoming organisation.
    
The air of mystery surrounding the organisation is likely to be either 
the result of a deliberate attempt to engage media attention in the run-
up to the launch, or a symptom of genuine uncertainty. Imran Khans 
indecisiveness is legendary: it was publicly manifested in the way he 
agonised for years over retiring from cricket, and again in his 
inability to make up his mind over whether or not to carve a political 
career. But there is also a third possibility: the reticence could owe 
itself to the fact that he hasnt yet been told precisely what sort of 
body he is on the verge of founding.
    
The obvious question would be, By whom? One could hazard a couple of 
guesses based on the sort of company he has kept in recent years  but 
that would, perhaps, be stepping too far into the speculative realm. 
Its best to wait and see. However, the possibility should not be 
overlooked. Imran Khan unabashedly exploited his popularity as a 
sportsman in soliciting contributions for his cancer hospital project. 
That was, and remains, a good cause (despite his efforts to use it as a 
basis for periodical tirades against Islamabad). A political (or semi- 
political) organisation is a different matter altogether.
    
Imran Khans criticism of the existing order has thus far been couched 
in generalities. Almost everyone agrees that corruption is an 
unmitigated evil, that its tentacles stretch deep into the Pakistani 
body politic (although Pakistan is by no means the only victim of the 
scourge), and that it needs to be rooted out. Nor is the proposition 
that far greater significance should be attached by the state to 
education and health care by any means original (Its interesting to 
note, however, that Imran Khan has refrained from advocating lower 
defence expenditure as a means of funding such benefits. Is this merely 
a coincidence?) And attacks on the elite are always welcome in countries 
with yawning disparities of wealth, even when they come from a member of 
that very class.
    
Where Imran Khans advocacy of reforms diverges from the line of 
argument usually adopted by objective intellectuals is in his persistent 
attempts to convey the impression that the present government is 
directly and solely responsible for all of Pakistans ills. That is 
utter nonsense. Whatever the failings of the current administration  
and there are many  the national woes most worthy of redressal have 
been around for much longer than Ms Bhuttos tenure in power. It is 
noticeable that Imran Khan has never commented adversely on the 
countrys most recent (and most disastrous) military dictatorship; when 
General Zia-ul-Haq asked him a decade or so ago to renounce his 
retirement from cricket, he veritably leapt at the opportunity. And his 
current dalliance with General Zias chief civilian protege seems to 
ignore the fact that the Nawaz Sharif governments reputation for 
corruption was at least as high as that of the present regime.
    
Could Imran Khan be out to avenge a personal slight? It was clearly 
stupid of the state-run media initially to ignore him in World Cup-
related publicity. But his plaints go back much further, in apparent 
ignorance of an obvious contradiction: why should the government be nice 
to him when he has gone out of his way to be nasty to it?
    
Then there is the evidence of hypocrisy. A corroborative anecdote may 
not be out of place. On a private visit to Dubai not many moons ago, 
Imran Khan insisted on being shot only above the waist by a Press 
photographer. The reason? Having (rather silly) advised Pakistani youth 
to stick to indigenous attire, he did not wish to be photographed 
wearing  calamity of calamities!  a pair of trousers.
    
Never mind the complex issue of his rather sudden exchange of vows with 
Jemima Goldsmith after insisting on several occasions that he would 
settle for an arranged marriage with a simple Pakistani bride  not to 
mention the trail of broken-hearted girl friends. 
   
Those are personal matters. But the series of inconsistencies are very 
much in the public domain, particularly after the acknowledgement of 
political ambitions. The most generous interpretation of these would be 
an inordinate level of naiveti. But even that can be a dangerous trait 
in the political arena, especially in view of a broad pre-existing 
constituency of admirers.
    
Naiveti does not quite suffice as an explanation for Imran Khans most 
recent outbursts against Ms Bhutto, which were ill- advised, totally 
uncalled for, and even callous; the hospital bomb was a heinous crime, 
and the prime minister had every right to condemn it as well as to visit 
the site. His inability to restrain his gut instincts even amidst a 
tragedy of such proportion is not a good omen.
    
Imran Khan does, of course, has every right to participate in politics, 
even if his experience of power play is limited to cricket board 
intrigues. He may even surprise sceptics like me. But a great many 
questions will have to be plainly answered before that transpires. In 
the meanwhile, the over-enthusiastic faithful would do well to remember 
that its wise to be wary of pied pipers, particularly when it is not 
clear who is calling the tune.</pre><hr><pre>

SHARJAH, April 19: The big boys, which the South Africans are fast 
becoming in international cricket, gave just a glimpse of their precious 
talent by winning the tournament on their maiden appearance.
    
They were solid in their approach and planned things with a touch of 
professionalism while India simply faltered in basics  and that made 
all the difference. A cool-headed innings from Gary Kirsten, disciplined 
fielding and bowling (in that order) by South Africa and a by-now-
familiar Indian collapse and four silly run outs all added to the 
excitement of the day. And, in the end, the team that deserved to win, 
won the game.
    
South Africa once showed the maturity of a champion team, reviving the 
innings after a stuttering start which saw them reeling at 20 for two in 
just 5.5 overs. From that precarious position, in the face of an 
enthusiastic early Indian attack, they knocked up a massive 287 for five 
in the allotted 50 overs, a score which meant India had to struggle from 
the very start which they duly did.
    
Gary Kirsten anchored the innings while Pat Symcox, promoted in the 
batting, played his role as a pinch-hitter to perfection to suffocate 
Indian hopes of restricting the marauding South Africans to a manageable 
total.
    
India also tried the same stuff, sending Anil Kumble at the crucial No. 
3 spot. He failed to copy the role of Symcox while Sachin Tendulkar, who 
needed to provide the ballast as Kirsten did for South Africa, fell half 
way. Both became victims to silly run outs. Kirsten, later named Man of 
the Match and Man of the Series, planned his innings carefully and held 
one end intact and let others go after the bowling. He scored an 
unbeaten 115 of 142 balls which included four fours and a six, all 
scored during the first 50 of his innings. As his innings wore on, he 
kept the strike rotating with singles and twos.
    
What gave the South African innings a kick start was the third-wicket 
stand of 95 runs between Kirsten and Symcox. Symcox was off the blocks a 
bit slowly, but once he had his eye in he simply blew the Indian bowling 
to pieces. His swashbuckling 61 off just 49 balls with five fours and 
two sixes virtually demoralised the Indian attack, which later order 
batsmen exploited to the limit. When Symcox left, the South Africans had 
already built a strong platform, scoring 115 for three in 21 overs.
    
The introduction of spinners too failed to apply brakes on the South 
African run-rate. Skipper Hansie Cronje (26 off 30 balls) and Derek 
Crookes (25 off 30 balls) did not take any undue risks and went about 
their task in a methodical manner, chipping in with some useful 
contributions.
    
The only way India could arrest the spiralling run-rate was to get 
wickets. They did but not at regular intervals.
    
Brian McMillan, picked up the right time to show his class, which has 
earned him the sobriquet of being the best all-rounder in the world.    
The burly all-rounder quickly made his impression, smacking hapless 
Venkatapathy Raju for two successive sixes. He ended the innings with a 
flourish scoring a brisk 37 off just 24 balls which also included two 
hits to the boundary.
    
The Indian bowlers sparkled only in the first five or six overs, with 
both Javagal Srinath and Venkatesh Prasad troubling the top order 
batsmen with movements of the seam. But as the South African innings 
wore on it was just a question of containing the runs which they just 
couldnt.
    
Kumble, the most impressive of all, took two wickets for 42 runs.
    
India had to make a blazing start to make a match of it, which meant 
they needed to score at least 90 for 100 in the first 15 overs. They did 
plan that way but luck wasnt on their side. One can easily say they 
blew up the chance with four of their batsmen running themselves out, 
but all the batsmen were out by just inches. Such was their bad luck 
that even a long throw from third man landed right on the stumps which 
caught skipper Azharuddin just inches off the crease.
    
Vikram Rathore and Tendulkar made a positive start to the innings, 
seeing off the early spells from Fanie de Villiers and Shaun Pollock. 
The way the two stroked the ball raised visions of a close match, but in 
the end it proved an illusion.
    
Rathore, tied down by Craig Matthews in his very first over, tried to 
hit the bowler in sheer frustration only to be caught behind by Dave 
Richardson. His 23 off 35 balls included one four and one six.
    
Kumble, sent in for the Symcox job, did go after the bowling, but as 
luck would have it a straight drive from Tendulkar took a twist off the 
hand of Matthews and landed on the stumps, catching Kumble out of the 
crease. Kumble scored 10 runs with one four.
    
Sidhu tried to repair the damage but due to a horrible mix-up of yes 
and no ran Tendulkar out. Sidhu called Tendulkar for a run, but sent 
him back and Pollock made no mistake in removing the bails. Tendulkar, 
playing his 115th international, cracked 57 with six fours in 71 balls 
and, in the process became the third Indian after Kris Srikkanth and 
Azharuddin, to cross the coveted 4,000 mark in one-day cricket.
    
Sidhu quickly followed Tendulkar to the dressing room, getting out to a 
tired looking shot off Cronje and holing out in the deep to Matthews. He 
scored 26 off 44 balls. Skipper Azharuddin and Sanjay Manjrekar raised a 
flicker of hope playing quite sensibly against a charged up South 
African attack. They werent going for big hits, but were keeping the 
scoreboard moving with singles and twos.
    
The two were associated in a 52-run stand for fifth-wicket, but the 
required run-rate shooting up every passing minute they were left with 
no choice but to go for bit hits. They did, but at the expenses of their 
wickets.
    
India needed to score 91 runs in the last 10 overs for a victory. But 
the run out of Azharuddin killed off their hopes. Azhar was returning to 
complete the second run when Symcoxs throw from third man hit the 
stumps. He was out in the 41st over after scoring 39 off 43 balls with 
three fours.
    
His fall virtually triggered a procession back to the pavilion though 
Nayan Mongia stemmed the rot for a while with a fluent 23. Manjrekar 
completed the comedy script of run outs after scoring 41 off 47 balls 
with one four.
    
Kirsten, who scored a total of 356 runs in five matches, including two 
centuries both against India, was named Man of the Match and Man of the 
Series.
    
Rashid Latif of Pakistan won the award for the fastest 50 - scored off 
30 balls against India. Matthews was declared the Best Bowler while the 
Best Fielder went to Kirsten, his third award.
    
A delighted South African skipper Cronje said: We have achieved almost 
all the goals we set for this season, except for the big one (World 
Cup).

ATLANTA, April 19: On the basis of statistics Pakistan came out on top 
in the six-nation hockey tournament here with a total of nine points out 
of a possible ten. What was more, Tahir Zaman, one of the best inside 
forwards in the world today, finished on top of the scorers list with a 
total of six goals from five matches.
    
Of the remaining Pakistan players Kamran Ashraf, centre forward, had two 
goals, Asif Bajwa, Raza Aleem, Mohammad Shahbaz, Shafqat Mehmood and 
Muhammad Sarwar, one each. That made a total for the team of 13 goals 
scored and four conceded.
    
But figures do not describe the glorious finish to the tournament in 
which Pakistan and India shared four goals, leaving Pakistan 
unquestionable winners of the tournament by one point. Here was a 
splendid advertisement for hockey played as it was intended to be with 
fast free flowing movements from either side.
    
India and Pakistan will not meet again until they clash in pool match at 
the Olympic Games in July.
    
There was every reason to be satisfied with Pakistans performance as a 
whole. Apart from their individual brilliance they worked well together 
as a team and if changes are to be made when the squad for the Olympic 
Games is finalised it should be difficult to decide whom to drop.
    
Looking closely at the six teams who took part in the tournament 
Pakistan and India proved themselves to be potential Olympic winners.
    
Leading scorers: Six goals: Tahir Zaman (Pakistan). Three: Dhanraj 
Pillay (India), Russell Garcia (Great Britain), Santiago Capurro 
(Argentina), Cook-Kyo Jhin (South Korea), Baljit Singh Dhillon (India), 
Two: Kamran Ashraf (Pakistan), Ahmed el Maghraby (United States), Robert 
Thompson (Great Britain).

<a name="inti">Intikhab hints at changes in team</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, April 21: Pakistan manager Intikhab Alam hinted that there 
might be a few changes in the Pakistan team for the coming tour of 
England.
    
"It's time that stern decisions are taken in terms of performances of 
the players from the series against Sri Lanka to the recently concluded 
tournament in Sharjah," Intikhab said, adding: "The time has come that 
the players are selected on their current track record than their past 
achievements."
    
Intikhab, without disclosing the names, said a few players might miss 
the bus for the England tour. "We are planning to take a few youngsters 
because England tour is also an educational tour. We will have a few 
county matches in which we can try them and if find talent, can groom 
them for the future."
    
Intikhab stressed that he would propose to the PCB selectors to pick 
youngsters from domestic cricket. "Players are performing and even then 
are not being selected. Until we don't select players from our domestic 
circuit, it will remain unimportant for all and sundry."
    
The former Pakistan captain believed that the team players lacked 
fitness. "They look fit but actually lack fitness that is required at 
top level. I have suggested the PCB to organise a 12 to 15 days camp at 
some hill station at which we will only concentrate on physical side. We 
will stress upon running to build stamina and strengthen muscles. "After 
the conclusion of that camp, we should have a training camp at Lahore,"
he said.

Sports Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, April 23: Pakistan Women's Sports Board has asked the 
national  federations  of  athletics,  table  tennis,  badminton, hockey 
and volleyball to obtain international confirmations of at least  four 
 countries by end of May to finalise the  staging  of `Invitational 
Women's Games 1996' from Oct 19-24 at  Islamabad.
    
During  the 'review meeting' of the 2nd Islamic Women's  Games, Begum 
Shahnaz Wazir Ali, special assistant to the prime  minister on social 
sector, requested the national federations of the  five sports  included 
in the invitational meet to obtain  confirmation from four to five 
countries for participation in the event. "It will be an opportunity of 
international competition for  our girls  to  get  ready,' Begum Shahnaz 
 said  while  stating  that allocations  have  already  been  made for 
 the  funding  of  the invitational  games at Islamabad and the ministry 
of  sports  was working on it.
    
It was learnt that invitations to Malaysia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, 
Iran and a number of Central Asian states has already been sent. However 
the federations are yet to get a response  from them for the meet. It 
may be added here that Begum Shahnaz Wazir Ali had earlier asked the 
federations to invite Muslim States to participate in the `invitational 
meet which will also serve as a rehearsal for the forthcoming bigger 
event next year. However, since the "Invitational Games" are been  dealt 
at the federation level, they want to invite those countries whose 
standard of game will be comparable to Pakistan. We want these 
invitational games to help boost the morale of our sportswomen who are 
working hard for the challenge, Qamar Saeed Zaidi, vice president, 
Pakistan Table Tennis Federation said.</pre>
