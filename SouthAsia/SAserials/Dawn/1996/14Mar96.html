<a name="pmno">PM : No nuclear test until security threatened</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
    
ISLAMABAD, March 10: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said Pakistan will 
continue its peaceful nuclear programme and will not conduct a test 
unless its survival and territorial integrity is threatened.

Commenting on the reported plans of India to conduct a second nuclear 
test, she said it was a matter of concern for Pakistan. Any nuclear 
test by India will have serious consequences, she said.
    
Latest reports suggest that India is not in a hurry, she said, adding 
that it was an election year in India as well as in United States. Such 
thing are leaked in election years.
    
She denied that there were chances of war between India and Pakistan. 
She said there was a tension between the two countries and it could not 
be eased unless the Kashmir was resolved under the resolution of United 
Nations.

<a name="paki">Pakistan capable of meeting Indian challenge: Assef</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD, Jan 12: Expressing extreme concern at Indias increased 
belligerency, Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali said that, to be 
or not to be, wont be the question if India goes ahead with its nuclear 
test and the world must understand that if India removes the deliberate 
ambiguity surrounding both countries nuclear programmes, then we will be 
forced to take similar measures for our protection.
    
In an interesting choice of words, Sardar Assef for the first time used 
the term deliberate ambiguity while referring to Pakistans nuclear 
programme. Conceding Indian superiority in conventional weapons, he 
said: We cant match them tank for tank or gun for gun...the numbers 
are too great. Therefore, we had to develop a peaceful nuclear 
programme, and maintained a deliberate ambiguity. India knows, we know 
and also the world, that both of us have a certain nuclear capability. 
He went on to warn that, we dont want to get involved in a nuclear race 
but if India gives up this ambiguity and puts its cards on the table 
forcing a show of hand, then we, too, will be forced to do so.
   
He said Pakistan was extremely concerned at the threats thrown by Delhi. 
These concerns, he added, emanated from a series of alarming 
developments like the testing and deployment of Prithvi missiles, test 
of Agni missile and now the Indian intention of testing a thermo nuclear 
hydrogen bomb.

<a name="isla">Islamabad reiterates support for CTBT</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hassan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, March 7: Pakistan reassured the United States of its 
principled support for the early conclusion of a truly comprehensive 
test ban treaty (CTBT) currently under international negotiations in 
Geneva.
    
A Foreign Office spokesman  said in-depth discussions were held on CTBT 
with Thomas Graham Jr., special representative of the US president on 
arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament.
    
The spokesman, who was urged by newsmen to answer several questions on 
the American media reports about an impending nuclear detonation test by 
Pakistan if India carried out its second nuclear test, refused to be 
drawn into a detail discussion about it, pointing out that the foreign 
ministry had already given its reaction to the American media report.
    
The spokesman, however, supplemented the earlier official statement 
saying: While taking appropriate steps to safeguard its security, I 
want to reiterate to you Pakistans principled policy. Firstly, Pakistan 
has nuclear capability but has decided at the highest level not to use 
it for non-peaceful purposes. Secondly, Pakistan has been in the 
vanguard of efforts globally and regionally to achieve the cause of non- 
proliferation.
    
Our many proposals, including the simultaneous signing of the NPT, the 
creations of a nuclear-free zone in South Asia, have, however, foundered 
because of the Indian negativism. The spokesman further stated: The 
developments across the border have further retarded the prospects for 
non-proliferation besides (producing) destabilising consequences to 
which our statement referred to yesterday.

<a name="hope">Pakistan hopeful of getting FDP status in ASEAN</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Abul Hasanat

BALI, March 9: Pakistan is hopeful that its request for the status of a 
full dialogue partner (FDP) in the Association of South East Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) will be fully processed by the mid of this year.
    
Briefing newsmen here about the outcome of the Prime Ministers visits 
to Brunei and Indonesia, the official spokesmen said the secretary-
general of ASEAN, Ajit Singh, had assured them that in view of a very 
comprehensive case presented by Islamabad, Pakistans request should 
have an easy sailing through different committees for final decision 
within the expected time.

India became a sectoral dialogue partner of ASEAN in July 1993 and was 
granted the status of FDP in December last. Following that, it 
automatically became member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).

<a name="outd">Outdated law main problem of Pakistan, says US scholar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report 
   
PESHAWAR, March 10: Michael E. Hartman of University of California and a 
Fulbright scholar of the Punjab University , has said Pakistan needs an 
independent mechanism for efficient checking of crimes and elimination 
of civil rights abuses in society .
    
Addressing a lecture on Evidence and Criminal Law, organised by the 
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan at the Frontier Law College, Mr 
Hartman pointed out that the major problem which Pakistan faced today 
was the outdated law which was framed by the British 120 years ago just 
to protect the white ruling minority of the subcontinent.
    
He said the Fulbright Commission, US, had allowed him to visit Pakistan 
and study its law and justice system. After spending two months 
collecting information on the issue, he had arrived at the conclusion 
that the organisation of police, courts and the prosecution were the 
same as years ago, which had caused many problems for society .He said 
the system needed complete overhauling.

My study reveals that the Pakistani people are not corrupt or involved 
in inhuman practices by virtue of their culture or nature, but there are 
certain other elements which are affecting the lives of various sections 
of society. For instance, there are generally two types of 
organisations police and the judiciary  around which the whole justice 
process in this country revolves; whereas in the US we have a very 
comprehensive and fool- proof technology to meet modern challenges in 
the field of crime and guard against any lapses. We have four levels 
police, prosecution/attorneys, Judge and the Jury  and every effort is 
made to punish only criminals and not innocent people. These four old 
institutions work as a check over corrupt practices in relevant 
departments and dispense early and good justice to the people, Mr 
Hartman added.
    
Most of the DIGs and other officers I met during my visits to various 
parts of Punjab admitted privately to me that they were corrupt because 
they have no fear of losing anything the job or promotion and they 
cared less about their salary, he said.
    
Comparing the two societies, Mr Hartman said that in the US, 90 per cent 
of the present police officers had been promoted from the rank of 
constable, keeping in view their performance and integrity. Here, he 
said , a constable had nothing to lose for his wrongdoings except a few 
hundred rupees (salary) . Here , promotion to upper grade was not 
possible, which made him prone to corrupt practices.
    
He opined that a corrupt system could be reformed through education.

<a name="mino">Minority voters to be included in new rolls</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, March 13: The ruling Pakistan Peoples Party is learnt to have 
decided to consolidate electoral rolls prepared for the next general 
elections by adding the names of voters belonging to the minority 
communities.

At the same time it was proposed that efforts should be made to win 
support of the main opposition party, the PML(N), by suggesting certain 
alternatives to the dual voting right to non-Muslim minorities. The 
issue is important and we want to achieve a consensus on it, CEC 
members were quoted as saying .
    
Central committee members suggested that an offer should be made to the 
opposition to either accept the proposed electoral reforms package or 
lend support to restore the joint electorate system if they were opposed 
to the dual voting right to non-Muslim minorities. The committee 
members, according to party sources, were confident that the opposition 
had a weak case, both politically and constitutionally on the electoral 
reforms package and may be left with no choice except to consider the 
government offer.

A senior member of the committee said that since the original 
constitution stood for joint electorate, the members of the present 
legislature, who accepted the leadership of the authors of the 
constitution, should logically agree to restore its original provisions.

<a name="kara">Karachi violence: Law enforcers, armed groups both responsible: AI</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Athar Ali
    
LONDON, March 11: Amnesty International has apportioned blame for 
continued violence in Karachi to both the law enforcement agencies and 
the armed opposition groups.
    
In its latest report, Human Rights Crisis in Karachi, Amnesty 
International, which sent a team of researchers to Sindh in December, 
urged the government to adopt measures to stop the large-scale human 
rights violations which are regularly taking place in Karachi. Its 
document reported cases of arbitrary arrests, torture, deaths in 
custody, extra-judicial executions, disappearances allegedly committed 
by law enforcement personnel and the human rights abuses allegedly 
perpetrated by armed opposition groups.
    
The team visited Karachi at a time when violence was at its worst and 
1,800 people were killed in the city in 1995: these included members of 
different political parties, law enforcement personnel and apolitical 
residents, including women and children.
    
Among many recommendations made in the report included the one which 
lays emphasis on the government to set up independent and impartial 
inquiries into every single report of unlawful detention, torture, death 
in custody, extra-judicial execution and disappearance, and to ensure 
that every member of the law enforcement agencies found responsible for 
such human rights violations is brought to justice. Only if the self-
perpetuating cycle of violence, in which human rights abuses continue to 
be perpetrated without punishment and in which impunity facilitates 
further violations, is broken, people in Karachi can again live in 
safety and dignity and enjoy their fundamental rights.
    
Another aspect that concerns, the AI is the reluctance by ordinary 
people to report human rights abuses perpetrated by armed political 
groups because of fear for their lives, and their lack of trust in the 
law enforcement agencies to protect them.

The report pays tribute to members of the Press who courageously report 
ongoing human rights violations and abuses in Pakistan. Many of them 
have themselves been victims of violence. Journalists who have published 
reports on corrupt practices, on strife within the parties and on 
killings in Karachi have been targeted by armed political groups.

In conclusion, Amnesty International has made several recommendations to 
the government and to armed opposition groups on the basis of the 
concerns expressed in the report.

Our Correspondent
    
LONDON, March 12: The British government has so far not been provided 
with any documentary evidence by the government of Pakistan against 
Mohajir Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussain which might support its 
demand for his return to Pakistan to face prosecution.
    
This was stated by British minister of state at the foreign office 
Jeremy Hanley, who visited Pakistan earlier this month.
    
Mr Hanley told Dawn that during his meeting with Interior Minister 
Naseerullah Babar, he was told that he would be provided with 
documentary evidence showing Mr Hussains involvement in violence in 
Karachi, and that he was directing terrorist activities from his 
London headquarters.
    
The British minister said that as long as he stayed in Pakistan such 
material was not handed over to him. Nor has any document been sent to 
him since then.

<a name="mqmw">MQM worker Sherri killed in encounter</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ghulam Hasnain

KARACHI, March 11: Mohammad Naeem Sherri, 26, carrying a head money of 
Rs five million, died with a companion in what the rangers claimed was 
an encounter in Gulshan-i-Iqbal.
    
Naeem Sherri, who had eluded the security forces for umpteenth time 
during the last many months and figured regularly in official versions 
of the violent incidents in the city, was allegedly required by the law 
enforcement agencies in a host of major cases of terrorism in which an 
unspecified numbers of people had perished.
    
The house which was raided by the rangers had been rented out to the 
family of Amjad Beg who also died with Sherri.
    
The deaths of two top party workers visibly shocked the MQM leaders. He 
(Naeem Sherri) was our national hero. They killed our hero, former 
minister Tariq Javed said.
    
A rangers handout said Naeem Sherri died in the encounter with them in 
the early hours of Monday around 2am. Rangers, acting on information, 
carried out a raid at a house in Gulshan-i-Iqbal where Naeem Sherri was 
hiding. He opened fire with a mouser, resulting in bullet injuries to an 
officer, two inspectors and a sepoy of rangers. In retaliation by the 
rangers, Sherri, with one of his accomplices, was killed on the spot, 
the handout said.
    
However, inquiries made by Dawn showed that the rangers killed Naeem 
Sherri as he tried to hide himself behind a television trolley during 
the raid. He was hit by many G-3 bullets fired from a distance of just 
few feet, doctors said.

Three people, including two MQM men, died in three different encounters 
in the city on Wednesday, the rangers and police said.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="feud">Feudalism stonewalls our economic development</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jafar Wafa

IT IS common knowledge now that, according to a foreign NGO, Pakistan 
ranks third among the top-most corrupt countries, with China blazing the 
trail and Indonesia closely behind. But what baffles economists is the 
fact that, apart from being an Asian country by geographical accident, 
there is nothing in common, politically and economically, between 
Pakistan and the two leading lights.
    
Ours is supposed to be a democracy of the Western model, in contrast 
with a totalitarian China and authoritarian, controlled democracy of 
Indonesia. Indonesia, which had been under military rule from mid-1960, 
had adopted a constitution that assigns a special role for the army in 
political affairs. Thus, corruption in China and Indonesia, despite 
their economic prosperity, can be blamed on their autocratic and 
authoritarian systems of government where the bureaucracy and the ruling 
clique have all the powers concentrated in their hands and are 
accountable to no one, let alone the people and their true 
representatives. But why is corruption rampant in Pakistan inspite of an 
Islamic Republican polity being firmly in place? We will find the answer 
when economic factors are analysed in what follows.
    
Economically, China has set a global record of fast and sustained 
growth, at an average always of 10 per cent annually for the last 15 
years or more. It is destined to occupy the top slot as an economic 
power outstripping the United States and Japan. There has been a 
consistent growth of nearly 7 per cent annum in Indonesia, which is 
likely to emerge as the second largest economy in Southeast Asia, full 
tiger among the present cubs. As for Pakistan, it is not even listed, by 
the Economist of London at least, as an emerging market. Our country 
is such a nonentity that Asia Week, its special anniversary issue of 
December 95, does not name Pakistan even in the 88-country list of tea 
consumption rating although we must have been consuming many times more 
tea than Israel, Oman, and Nepal. It appears, the world media still 
treat us as a part of historical India, though we only belong, like 
Nepal, to the same sub-continent as India. What our embassies and 
consulates do in off-shore chanceries to introduce to the media the 
country they represent is a question every one asks except, perhaps, 
those who run the country.
    
When privatisation came to be recognised as the most effective recipe 
for economic health, China plunged headlong in the stream of 
privatisation despite the governments totalitarian trait, palming off 
the unmanageable and loss-making units into private hands, local and 
foreign, thereby reducing the share of state-controlled industries from 
100 to a mere 40 in a decade and a half. Similarly, in Indonesia the 
process of privatisation, with or without transparency, is in high gear. 
It has recovered from the initial setbacks, as in the case of the 
national Telephone Dept, or Telecom, which is the fifth largest state 
undertaking with an annual gross revenue of $1.9 billion. Jakarta has 
now sold 19% of Telecoms shares, although at 25 per cent less than the 
original offer price. How many of our sick or healthy state-run 
enterprises has our government been able to self off even with 
controversial transparency, is not a well-guarded secret. He too have, 
of course, sold 26 per cent shares of the Telecommunication Corporation, 
but in an allegedly questionable manner, giving out inflated figures 
regarding the number of telephone lines in the network and its net 
revenue, with the result that these shares are being re-sold at an 
appreciable discount. Another instance of our objectionable conduct is 
furnished by our Privatisation Commissions backing off from disposing 
of UBL at the first resistance from prospective buyers thereby giving a 
red signal to other buyers who may be thinking of bidding for other 
state-owned enterprises. Thanks to the good sense of the Cabinet 
Committee on Privatisation, its intervention has repaired the damage 
done.
    
Foreign economists who have been watching the astounding phenomenon 
economic miracle in Southeast Asia with awe and admiration, have 
finally concluded that this economic boom has not come directly on the 
heels of accelerated tempo of exports and rapid pace of 
industrialisation. Such a process, through which the West has passed, 
takes a far longer time for the kind of long leap the Southeast Asians 
have taken in so short a period. It is begin realised that, in fact, the 
boom began with reform on the farmland in the neglected country side, 
launched through revolutionary land reform measures and by introduction 
of new technology to boost agricultural productivity and thereby disrupt 
the whole lot of peasants and farmers who constitute the bulk of every 
Asian countrys population. 
   
The land reform came in Japan after the nemesis of World War Two, which 
increased the farmers income substantially. The same thing happened in 
Taiwan and Korea where rural prosperity provided a big market for 
consumer goods at home before the expanding industries could find 
surpluses for exporting abroad. In China, private farms were allowed to 
be set-up experimentally. These farm plots proved to be model farms 
leaving the commune farms far behind in yield and quality of product. 
In Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia the palm tree growers and rubber 
planters turned into exporters and entrepreneurs. Coming nearer home, 
one finds the same thing happening across the eastern borer. India 
abolished absentee land lordism, Zamindari and Talukadari, relics of 
Mughal imperialism, which were purposely perpetuated by the British lest 
the multitude of rural masses awake and turned resourceful enough to 
imperil the colonial rule. According to the latest estimate of 
international agencies, 200 million people in India (one-and-a half 
times the total population of Pakistan) who have shifted from villages 
to urban centres, with their roots still in villages, constitute a 
thriving middle class capable of buying consumer goods and electronic 
gadgets made in abundance locally in the country, beckoning to the 
industrialised nations for investment in India to cater to the demands 
of the burgeoning new well-to-do class for more sophisticated products. 
The benefit of land reform in India is not reflected only in the 
emergence of a fairly prosperous and politically conscious middle class 
but also in the phenomenal progress achieved on the farm. For instance, 
although only about 15 per cent of the agricultural land in India is 
irrigated, against 65 per cent in our country, the cereal yield per 
hectare in the former stands at about 3,000 tonnes against a little less 
than 2,000 tonnes in the latter. Consequently, whereas Pakistan has been 
importing 2 million tonnes of wheat, at an average per year lately, 
India has a small exportable surplus of wheat after feeding seven times 
more mouths.
    
Ours is still a feudal state, an anachronism in the dying years of the 
present century, with 70 of population living in villages, poor and 
politically powerless, eking out a living as serfs and bondsmen of the 
feudal lords. The latter, instead of caring for their vast landed 
estates and increasing farm production, are holding the reins of 
government. So what check on the extravagance and corruption of the 
rulers can such a mute majority exercise? Herein lies not only the 
answer to the unchecked corruption in Pakistan despite its democracy, 
but also the clue to the countrys economic backwardness.

<a name="6poi">6-point strategy devised for economic uplift: PM</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

JAKARTA, March 8: Information, business and trade are the most 
critical elements of the integration of the world community, as we 
approach the new millennium, prime minister Benazir Bhutto said.
    
To cope up with the new realities, she announced that her government has 
devised and is implementing a befitting six-point strategy for 
Pakistans economic development.
    
She said this while addressing the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and 
Industries.

The prime minister said: We move into a new economic and political era 
where the global community and the global economy are onethey are 
linked intrinsically, and will rise and fall together.
    
Elaborating the six-point strategy, She said, we have to put in place a 
programme for macro-economic stabilisation so that investors can predict 
interest rates, and relative prices with a degree of certainty.
 
Secondly, she said, the PPP government has had a long-standing 
commitment to alleviating poverty in Pakistan. I feel gratified that we 
have been able to translate that commitment into a Social Action 
Programme that aims to arm the poor with good health and education. This 
will upgrade our labour force, will promote equity and will lead to 
gainful employment, she said.
    
Thirdly, the she said, we in Pakistan firmly believe that the engine of 
future economic growth is in the private sector. We have put in place a 
privatisation package that creates a highly favourable investment 
climate.
 
Fourthly, we are conscious that downstream investment and manufacturing 
potential can be realised only through adequate infrastructure. 
Therefore, we have put in place an energy plan which has brought in 
foreign investment in power generation. The telecommunications sector 
has seen heavy investment too.
    
Fifthly, although we are firmly committed to pursuing rapid economic 
growth, we are careful that this does not come at the cost of the 
quality of air that we breathe or water that we drink.
   
For too long in the past, she said, Pakistan pursued a trade policy that 
sought to protect local markets from international competition. In the 
recent years, there has been a sea-change in our thinking and we have 
systematically brought down the protective walls that surrounded our 
economy, she said.
    
The premier said, through ongoing reforms of the tariff-structure, 
customs, administration, export finance and strengthening of our 
international communications network, we are encouraging Pakistani 
manufacturers and producers to find their place in the international 
market.
 
Private investment now has full legal and constitutional cover under the 
Foreign Private Investment (Promotion and Protection) Act which enjoys 
the support of all political parties.

<a name="trad">Trade deficit swells to $2.37bn during 8 months</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 11: Pakistans trade deficit swelled to $2.37 billion in 
the last eight months as against $1.37 billion loss suffered in the 
international trade during July 1995 to February 1996.
    
Official trade figures released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics 
showed total export earnings of $5.05 billion in the last eight months. 
This reflects an increase of 2.20 per cent over $4.96 billion earned 
during same period of 1994-95.
    
In sharp contrast to this insignificant rise in export earnings, the 
import bill swelled by almost 18 per cent in dollar terms and over 26 
per cent in rupee value during the period under review. 
   
In terms of hard cash, imports were worth $7.42 billion during July 1995 
to February 1996 period, as against $6.30 billion imports during the 
same period of 1994-95.
    
A worrying feature of the bulging import bill is the persisting downward 
trend of machinery and capital goods inflow for the second consecutive 
month, indicating a slowdown of investment in the country. 

Machinery import had come down to $193.44 million in January 1996 and 
went further down to $161.91 million in February. Import of machinery in 
February 1995 was worth $224.21 million.
    
On export side, cotton showed phenomenal growth because its export in 
1994-95 was insignificant. The cotton exports, during this term fetched 
$341.93 million.

<a name="imfa">IMF allows gradual cut in tariff</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, March 13: The International Monetary Fund has allowed the 
Government of Pakistan to stagger the reduction of tariffs from 65 per 
cent to 35 per cent over a number of years instead of during the next 
financial year, Dr A.R. Kemal, Chief Economist, Planning Commission 
disclosed.
    
He also stated that henceforth the Planning Commission would not remain 
content with processing and appraising projects but would also pursue 
the implementation with the executing ministries.
    
The drastic reduction of import dues and slashing down of items on 
restricted list from 800 to 100 had not produced any positive effect on 
industrialisation in Pakistan, Dr Kemal observed. In spite of this 
knowledge, he remarked, the World Bank and International Monetary Fund 
put pressure on the Government of Pakistan to reduce the duty.
    
While the industries which have no comparative advantage and are 
inefficient could not withstand the reduced protection, those industries 
which need three to five years to become viable, needed time to adjust 
with reduced duty rates on imports. It was, however, after the lowered 
tariffs began to hit such industries, the two Brettonwoods institutions 
had now demurred and advised the GOP to reduce these to 35 per cent 
gradually.

<a name="stoc">Stocks finish weekend session on subdued note</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, March 7: Stocks finished the weekend session on a subdued note 
as investors were not inclined to take new positions in the absence of 
new guiding factors.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange luckily did not break the 1,700-point barrier 
but stood at the edge of it and could move both ways after trading 
resumes next week.
    
The 100-share index was last quoted at 1,700.70 as compared to 1,712.95 
a day earlier, reflecting the weakness of the base shares.
    
Although selling covered the entire list, it never assumed an alarming 
proportions as there were buyers at the dips, notably on blue chips 
counters.
    
But persistent decline in prices of some of the most outstanding issues 
in the energy sector despite news of higher interim earnings worried 
some of the genuine investors.
    
After steep rise during the last two weeks, both PSO and Shell, the two 
selling giants of the petroleum products, are under tremendous pressure 
and have lost substantial ground in the process.
    
Analysts said investors are divided over the direction of the market 
during the next week and feared that the World Cup matches could take 
steam out of it at least for the near-term.

Most of them predicted that the index could breach the 1,700- point 
barrier next week but will recover depending on the performance of the 
Pakistan team in the World Cup matches.
    
But most of the blue chips remained under selling and ended with clipped 
gains under the lead of Abbott Lab, Dawood Hercules, ICI Pakistan and 
PIC, falling by Rs 1.25 to 10.
    
Bank shares generally fell under the lead of Citicorp, Crescent Bank, 
Islamic Bank and some others as investors were not inclined to hold on 
to their positions.
 
They were followed by Cement shares, which also fell where changed on 
renewed profit-taking, major losers among them being Cherat and D.G.Khan 
Cement. Fazal Textiles, Gadoon Textiles led the list of major losers in 
the textile sector and Dewan Sugar in the sugar group.
    
The market was, however, not without some special features as a good 
number of leading shares managed to show fresh good gains under the lead 
of 4th ICP, Al-Noor Modaraba and Reliance Insurance, rising by Rs 1.50 
to 10.
    
The other good gainers were led by Atlas Lease, Fazal Textiles, Adamjee 
Insurance, Crescent Steel, International Industries, Philips, BOC 
Pakistan and Honda Atlas. Bata Pakistan also rose modestly after the 
announcement of an interim dividend at the rate of 10 per cent.
    
PTC vouchers again topped the list of actives, easy 25 paisa on 12.571m 
shares, followed by Hub-Power, lower 30 paisa on 9.084m shares, Lucky 
Cement, down 15 paisa on 0.1.520m shares, Fauji Fertiliser, up 50 paisa 
on 1.198m shares, ICI Pakistan, down Rs 1.25 on 0.469m shares, Sui 
Northern, off 50 paisa on 0.245m shares, LTV Modaraba, easy five paisa 
on 0.211 m shares and Bank of Punjab, off 35 paisa on 0.182 m shares. 
   
There were some other notable deals also. Trading volume fell further to 
28.2456m shares from the previous 29.043m shares owing to weekend 
considerations.
    
There were 348 actives, out of which 207 shares suffered fall, while 68 
rose, with 62 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="inve">Investors cover position at lower levels </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Commerce Reporter
   
KARACHI, March 13: Stocks turned in a mixed performance as investors 
covered positions at the lower levels but the rally was inconclusive 
owing partly to MQMs protest call against the killing of one of its 
activists.
    
The broader market, however, showed signs of distinct recovery as most 
of the base shares managed to put on good recoveries, lifting the index 
by 13.61 points.

The KSE 100-share index was last quoted at 1,638.26 as compared to 
1,624.65 a day earlier.
    
There is a perception and shared by many that the market was now well on 
the road to recovery, although it will not come with a bang but will be 
progressive.
    
The market will have been in real trouble had it breached the barrier 
of 1,600 points but luckily it did not allow bulls to play their role, 
said a leading analyst.
    
He said revival of demand at the lower levels, notably in the bank 
sector has raised hope that investors are back in the rings and may stay 
there as warranted by technical factors.
    
Some of the leading shares, which recovered sharply on strong support at 
the lower levels were led by 9th ICP, Al-Faysal Bank, Faysal Bank, and 
Bank Al-Habib, which showed gains ranging from Rs 2.25 to 4.45, the 
biggest rise being in the last named bank share.
    
The Askari General Insurance, which came on the board on Tuesday, 
maintained its upward drive on strong support and was quoted further 
higher by Rs 4 on a volume of well over 0.171m shares.
    
Adamjee Insurance also came in for active short-covering at the lower 
levels owing to last three days sell-off and was quoted higher by Rs 
3.50.
    
Dewan Salman rose for the second on belated reaction to the setting of a 
PTA plant by 1997 at a cost of $400 million.
    
After having lost sharply during the last three days, energy shares came 
in modest short-covering and rose under the lead of PSO, Genertech 
Pakistan, and Sui Northern and so did cement scripts, major gainers 
among them being D.G.Khan Cement and some others.
    
Most of the MNCs, however, remained under pressure in the absence of 
strong foreign buying and ended further lower under the lead of Dawood 
Hercules, Hoechst Pakistan, Sandoz Pakistan, Brooke Bond Pakistan and 
Nestle Milkpak, falling by Rs 2 to 5.
    
But the biggest decline was noted in Telecard, which fell by Rs 10 as 
buyers were not inclined to pick its shares owing to inflated levels.
    
Among the locals, which fell sharply PILCORP, Atlas Bank, Metropolitan 
Bank, Bannu Woollen, and Sapphire Textiles were leading, falling by one 
rupee to Rs4.

PTC shares were heavily traded, steady five paisa on 14.888 million 
shares followed by Hub-Power, lower 15 paisa on 10.788m shares, Dhan 
Fibre, up 15 paisa on 1.765m shares, Lucky cement, higher 40 paisa on 
0.987m shares, ICI Pakistan, steady 15 paisa on 0.606m shares Fauji 
Fertiliser, up 25 paisa on 0.391 shares, and LTV Modaraba, unchanged on 
0.109m shares.

Trading volume rose to 32.099m shares from 24.933m shares a day earlier 
thanks to active trading in current favourites.

There were 334 active, out of which 153 actives, out of which 153 shares 
fell, while 110 rose, with 71 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="exec">Executive vs Judiciary        </a>                                     
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE conflict is age-old, and in countries such as ours is destined to 
endure. Over-populated by illiterates (increasing at a growth rate of 
over 3.5 per cent per year) who are paid to vote in their leaders with 
their feet by ticking a symbol, or threatened with reprisals if they do 
not, there is no foreseeable solution.
    
We are ruled by an undemocratic political party which not once in its 
life span of a quarter century has felt sufficiently secure to even rig 
an in-house leadership election. Two pillars of the state, the 
legislature and the executive, are riddled with corruption, politics has 
been criminalised and has destroyed all the democratic institutions left 
to us by the Raj and those which we have vainly tried to build up. The 
third pillar, the judiciary, is now politicised as never before. Divided 
from within, it needs the support of the fourth, the Press, which must, 
in these times of dire straits, tell the people of the true facts and 
build up public opinion to strengthen those endeavouring to save our 
judiciary and help it gain its independence from the tyranny of the 
executive.
    
The hearing of Rais-ul-Mujahideen Habibul Wahabul Khairis writ 
petition, the 1995 Judges Case, which commenced on November 5 in 
Islamabad, was resumed in Karachi on March 3. The legal lights of the 
Potohar Plateau descended upon the sandy plains of Sindh. For four days 
I had the pleasure of sitting in between my friend and counsel, Jadoogar 
of Jeddah Sharifuddin Pirzada, former attorney-general, consistent 
ardent defender of all PPP governments, Yahya Bakhtiar. I reminded the 
two gentlemen that both have now reached a stage where it is more 
important for them to dwell on what good they can leave behind for 
posterity rather than on how they can further adversely affect us in 
their chase for transient glory.
 
On the first day, Cambridge Chaudhry Senator Aitzaz Ahsan, defender of 
the government, lucidly rounded off his arguments begun in Islamabad 
last month. He respectfully put it to Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah and 
Justices Ajmal Mian, Fazle Ilahi, Manzoor Hussain Sial and Mir Hazar 
Khan Khoso, that the word consultation means neither consent nor 
consensus. His point is that if the President (prompted, of course, by 
the Prime Minister) decides to appoint, say, an Oxford Chaudhry as the 
Chief Justice of Pakistan, and if the retiring chief justice, for good 
reason, says no, a meaningful consultation has taken place and the 
Oxonian can thus be appointed. As for qualifications for this position 
at the pinnacle of our judiciary, if a man has simply been enrolled as a 
high court advocate for a period of 10 years, even if he has not 
practised at the Bar during that period, he qualifies. The Chaudhrys 
closing arguments were easily understood and were heard until the judges 
rose for the mid-morning recess.
    
The President of the Supreme Court Bar Association (on court notice), my 
friend Akram Shaikh, then took over, using arguments as weighty and as 
substantial as he himself is. This was the first time I had heard him 
argue in court. He had clearly done his homework and with great clarity 
presented an account of how judicial appointments have been made and 
how, when they have been made departing from the conventional norm of 
seniority and suitability, there has been great resentment in the 
judiciary itself and amongst the members of the Bar.
    
Akram also replied to a somewhat puzzling proposition raised by Aitzaz 
in his earlier arguments. According to the senator, once a man takes an 
oath, no matter how undesirable and politically partisan he may be, he 
is miraculously and immediately transformed into a benign, objective, 
apolitical human being. This, said Akram (of course in courtly and 
judicial language) was utter rot. No mans character undergoes a 
whitewash merely by him swearing an oath, and no oath can change the 
public perception of that man built up over the years.
 
Countering Aitzaz, Akram said that were the sole qualification needed to 
be a judge a 10-year period of enrolment as a high court advocate, and 
were a sworn an oath capable of converting a bounder into an angel, 
then, as recently contemplated by Ms Bhutto, she could justifiably 
appoint Jehangir Badr as her chief justice of Pakistan.
    
Akram finished off by requesting their Lordships to plug all holes, 
end the controversy now plaguing the judiciary, and settle for all times 
to come the matter of the appointment of judges. He expressed the Bars 
regret at the pressures exerted by the federal government on the Chief 
Justice during the hearing of the case and gave his assurance of the 
Bars full support to the court in its hour of test and trial.
    
Akram was followed by Dr Riazul Hassan Gilani, a former Deputy Attorney-
General, now representing the Lahore High Court Bar Association (also on 
court notice), who enlightened the court on the Islamic aspect. He took 
just over a day, speaking in fluent Urdu, to make one significant point. 
As far as Islam is concerned, the chief justice is supreme and his word 
is the law of the land. The others are of little or no relevance.
    
At the end of the Doctors enlightening lecture, the executives senior 
defending counsel, Yahya, asked me if I had understood it all. As much 
as you have, I replied. There is no risk of Yahya trying to rebut any 
of the irrefutable Islamic points of reference.
    
The weaver of magic spells then took the floor, the Jadoogar of Jeddah 
rose in his role as the senior-most amicus curiae, and to an appreciable 
extent commenced to redeem himself. The courtroom was full. Without 
doubt, he is a master of the history of the law and of the constitutions 
of the subcontinent, and of his country in particular with much of the 
making of which he has been involved. He confesses that any wrong he may 
have done was done under the prevailing circumstances in the larger 
national interest. But now, to his credit, he admitted: The despotic 
regimes and some of the democratic governments by their actions and 
deeds have impaired the independence of the judiciary. But two or more 
wrongs do not make one right. The independence of the judiciary must now 
be preserved and protected.
    
Time being of the essence, (Justice Sials last working day before his 
retirement on March 20), Sharifuddin followed the process taught to 
Mohammed Ali Jinnah by John Molesworth Macpherson and handed over to the 
judges a brief on the points upon which he would elaborate.
    
He touched the very source, the report of the committee formed in 1945, 
in undivided India, to formulate the future constitutions of the 
subcontinent, headed by that eminent jurist Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and 
with Justice Jaykar of the federal court of India (later to sit on the 
Privy Council in England) as a member. The committee visualised a 
parliamentary form of government being introduced, with the judiciary 
being subjected to tremendous political pressures, and thus realised the 
absolute necessity of ensuring its independence under all foreseeable 
circumstances. Acknowledging that the president would either have to act 
in his own discretion, or as advised by the prime minister and the 
cabinet, or perhaps by others, the committee concluded that as far as 
the judiciary was concerned, the president should and must be guided by 
the advice of the chief justice of the country.
    
The recommendations formulated by the Sapru Committee concerning the 
appointment of judges of the supreme and high courts were bodily lifted 
by the framers of the 1949 Indian constitution and of Pakistans 1956 
Constitution and the same provisions have been incorporated in our 
subsequent Constitutions, including that of 1973.
    
Sharifuddin quoted Winston Churchill: The independence of the judiciary 
from the executive is the prime defence against tyranny. And Lord Lane, 
a chief justice of England: You can have the best law, perfectly 
drafted, but if it is administered by a bad judge it is useless. And 
Palkhiwala of India: You must have courts of law as watch-dogs of 
freedom and not poodles of the party in power. And our own Shafiur 
Rahman: it is a misfortune that our Constitutions have not evoked that 
commitment, respect, regard and attention from the constitutional 
authorities and statutory functionaries which they deserve. Our 
constitutions have been abrogated, held in abeyance for periods longer 
than promised and have been massively deviated from.

Sharifuddin has made an impressive start. He was on his feet when the 
court rose on Wednesday afternoon and will continue on Sunday morning.
    
Attorney-General Qazi Jameel, who turned up on the third day, asked me 
who I was representing. The people of Pakistan, I told him. His view 
was that it was he who was representing the sovereign people of 
Pakistan. But he knows that we know that he serves only the people who 
reside in the prime ministerial palace on the hill in Islamabad.

Editorial Column

RAZIA BHATTI is no more. In her death Pakistan has lost one of the most 
courageous journalists who wielded her powerful pen to uphold truth and 
oppose all forms of suppression of basic freedoms. Her life-long mission 
and commitment was to fight for justice in a country which has "bartered 
away the promise of its birth", to use her own words from an editorial 
comment which appeared in the first issue of  Newsline which she edited 
with fine professionalism until the day of her death. Razia was from the 
younger generation of journalists who entered the profession at a time 
in the sixties when the infamous Press and Publications Ordinance ruled 
the roost. Yet, she was not the one to be overawed or intimidated easily 
by the prevailing odds, and developed a style of writing at once 
powerful and perceptive.

Later when she became editor herself (of Herald) Razia showed creativity 
and drive in laying down a new format for the magazine, focusing on the 
burning issues and concerns of the day, and in making it a new and 
powerful voice in periodical journalism. In the process, she often 
encountered obstacles but remained steadfast and uncompromising in her 
approach and spirit. After a twelve-year eventful stint at the Herald, 
she founded a new magazine Newsline which established her journalistic 
skills and courage beyond doubt. Razia Bhatti's crusading spirit was 
widely recognised. She won the International Women's Media Foundation 
Award for "courage in journalism" in 1994. Even after this when unwise 
rulers tried to browbeat her, she fought back bravely and won. In the 
process, the cause of Press freedom was advanced one more crucial step.
What stands out as her most significant contribution to journalism in 
Pakistan, apart from her exceptional courage, was her professional 
approach to issues. This involved for her and for her team of dedicated 
colleagues consistent hard work, meticulous planning and proper 
selection of topics she wanted to write about or have written on for her 
paper. While she took an avid interest in political issues, her concern 
was equally strong to promote justice in every walk of life. Hence 
issues such as literacy, population, education, health, women, crime, 
violence and the like found a place in her magazine. Not many editors 
thought it worth their while to do features on the dacoits in Sindh (to 
the extent of getting them interviewed in their hideouts) or 
investigative stories on the narcotics trade which won her the Folio 
Asian Magazine Publishing Award (Singapore) in 1987.  Razia made her 
mark in the annals of Pakistani journalism and the trail she has blazed 
will doubtless show the way to many young and aspiring journalists.

<a name="anin">An indictment and an eye-opener  </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

THE Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has done a good job by taking 
note of the deplorable state of education in this country. The HRCP's 
annual report points out a number of shocking lapses in this sector 
which should put all of us to shame. The fact which is not always duly 
recognised is that corruption and apathy, especially in the primary 
education sector, rob our children of their birthright. This is 
supported by statistical data in the HRCP report. Only 28 per cent of 
the girls and 53 per cent of the boys are enrolled in school. Out of 
these 70 per cent of the girls and 50 per cent of the boys drop out 
before completing primary schooling. Small wonder that Pakistan's 
literacy rate is a measly 36 per cent, one of the lowest in the world.  

The most dismal aspect of the primary education sector in this country 
is the government's appalling neglect of its basic responsibility of 
educating the child. It has increasingly been left to the private sector 
to set up schools to educate our children, which it does largely for a 
profit. According to the HRCP, there are 10 to 15 private schools for 
every government school in a number of towns and cities. But what also 
needs to be emphasised is that the private sector is not interested in 
operating in the rural areas where 68 per cent of the population lives. 
Ironically, the government institutions which are required to meet the 
bulk of the primary education need of the people are the victims of 
neglect, corruption and indifference. Thus, 38,000 primary schools are 
said to be without buildings, 50,000 have no boundary walls, 46,000 have 
no water and 60,000 have no toilets.  

The government's professed commitment to education notwithstanding it 
has failed to promote this sector significantly. The education budget 
has no doubt been enhanced. From Rs. 2.2 billion in 1985-86 the 
education development budget shot up to Rs 7.5 billion in 1994-95. The 
total expenditure on education is today 2.4 per cent of the GNP when it 
was 1.8 per cent ten years ago. But this increase in allocations is not  
making a corresponding impact on the quality of education, the number of 
institutions being opened and the enrolment ratio. Why? Partly because 
of the corruption and rot that have made deep inroads into education, 
and partly because of a general apathy towards this key sector of our 
national life. The HRCP reports confirm this trend. It informs the 
readers that a sizable number of schools in the rural areas (500 or so 
in Sindh) are being used as godowns or private guest houses. In Punjab, 
the World Bank's loan for 3,600 schools was used for building only 19 
schools. And, of course, it might be added here that the phantom schools 
which exist only in the records of the education department are not too 
rare a phenomenon in Pakistan either.  

What then needs to be done? Apart from the numerous recommendations made 
by the HRCP, the key issue is that of eliminating corruption and making 
an honest and sensible use of the finances available for education. This 
can only be ensured if an awareness is created among the people about 
their children's birthright to education. In this way they can 
themselves be encouraged to act as pressure groups and demand schools 
for their children and act as watchdogs in relation to the performance 
of the schools in the public sector. There is also the need to bring the 
monitoring of schools to the grassroots level.  

For this purpose, it is important to set up parents-teachers committees 
(which, incidentally, are provided for under the law). These could also 
coopt non-parents as members who are public-spirited people and are 
willing and are able to help check irregularities in the education 
sector.  

There is also need to reactivate the directorates of schools to get them 
to perform their basic function of inspection of institutions. They no 
longer appear to be doing that. If the government feels that schools no 
longer need to be inspected, they might as well be disbanded, so that 
the money spent on maintaining teams of school inspectors is put to some 
productive use.

<a name="goin">Going nuclear and beyond</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M.B. Naqvi

THE chances are that Pakistan may not opt to sign the CTBT or NPT, and 
also the expected Convention envisaging the stoppage of the production 
of fissile material. Although there is a pressure from hardliners for 
declaring the country a nuclear weapons state after assembling and 
exploding the nuclear device, it is uncertain whether such a step would 
in fact be taken anytime soon. A note of caution seems to be in order.

Perhaps there has been a hush-hush kind of understanding or ditente, 
albeit still informal, between Indian and Pakistani hardliners who had 
been paradoxically brought together by Americans in their non-
proliferation pursuit. The understanding appears to be based on mutual 
recognition of each other as a responsible nuclear state which will 
commit itself to building an American-Russian style ditente over nuclear 
matters, with talks and agreements over various measures of mutually 
balanced disarmament and force reductions.
    
It is not certain as to where the idea originated, though a few Indian 
hardliners are known to have been proposing it during the last four or 
five years. The American attitude is not one of either shock or 
disbelief; indeed the two otherwise hostile and hawkish sets of 
individuals have certainly been coming closer to each other on this 
particular subject, while hostile stances continue over other major 
questions. The putative strategy appears to be to present a joint Indo-
Pakistan demarche on the Americans for a kind of opt-out of South Asia 
from the desired world-wide non-nuclear regime that the US and other 
western powers are trying to create in Geneva. This is predicated on the 
assurance that this region would be governed by a bilaterally controlled 
nuclear regime, with necessary agreements eventually being agreed upon 
to make it safe for itself and for rest of the world.
 
The assumption appears to be that the US will accept the fait accompli 
because there might be no other option left to it. The push for a 
nuclear test by both India and Pakistan is meant to clinch the issue so 
that the rest of the world should be left with no choice but to accept 
the emergent fact of life: two nuclear powers in South Asia deterring 
each other perpetually while painfully building what structures of peace 
may be unavoidable.
    
On the principle where there is will there is a way, it is useless to 
discuss its initial feasibility. What peace-loving democrats need to do 
is to examine the consequences of Pakistan exploding its way into the 
nuclear club. The first consequence would be that the Kashmir dispute 
between India and Pakistan would stand frozen. The hope of Kashmiris 
deciding their own future would be virtually pre-empted. Why? because 
since the deterrence between India and Pakistan would notionally be 
total neither will have any option or even incentive to change any of 
the basic policies hitherto followed; the Indians will sit tight over 
Kashmir and try to suppress their movement for Azadi with renewed effort 
and undivided attention.
    
The relationship between India and Pakistan would also be forced into 
permanent hostility with having to tom-tom a strange kind of friendship, 
with hostility intact, being constantly reshaped, as, say, was the case 
after SALT I and SALT II treaties between the US and Soviet Union. It 
would not be friendship nor would it be pure enmity; since each would be 
conscious of its ability to inflict crippling blows on the other, both 
would keep gnashing their teeth in impotent while their leaders will 
have to smile every now and then at photo opportunities. But there would 
be few people-to-people contacts. The promise in this hopefully growing 
ditente will be a reduction in the arms race in all the three main 
categories of armaments: the conventional arms, the nuclear weapons and 
missile or delivery vehicles. The proposition is, it can be asserted on 
the basis of facts of history. It did not happen between the Russians 
and the Americans, otherwise the Soviet Union would not have collapsed 
under the strains caused by a non-stop arms race, especially in the 
conventional arms race.
    
The doctrine that was developed after the French had crashed their way 
into the nuclear club holds that once a state acquires a nuclear 
capability and begins to deter its adversary, the next inexorable 
development is that a wholly new conventional armaments race begins. No 
matter what the initial hopes might be on the subject, going nuclear 
does not come cheap. For ensuring the credibility of the deterrent, it 
needs to be constantly updated by both sides and that requires improving 
the technology and frequent testing of new developments and inventions. 
This may not be the maximally expensive like conventional weapons 
systems but are not necessarily very inexpensive.
    
The missile race is even more difficult to control. The kind of 
disarmament measures that the talks about the rockets and MBFR 
negotiations could achieve in the Russia-American case may not be as 
easily available to India and Pakistan. Why? because both the 
superpowers had attained a level of strength in all branches of warfare 
that an actual reduction in the main weapons systems was technically 
beneficial to both sides; it was essentially rationalisation of the two 
deterrents. Moreover, the superpowers had no bitter or bilateral 
territorial disputes in which masses of people on either side could be 
involved; there was something ersatz in the supposed bitterness between 
the two sides.
    
In the case of Pakistan and India the disparity between what they can 
acquire and or produce is so great that the Indians would constantly be 
tempted to disregard the puny Pakistani effort and be done with 
Pakistani pretentions. All that they may then have to do is to steel 
themselves for a certain (limited) degree of possible destruction in 
India so that they could, by threatening actual war, either force the 
Pakistanis to blink or present the prospect of utter devastation of all 
its urban-industrial centres at the cost of a fairly small loss in India 
(in comparative terms). Indian Realpolitik wallahs can in fact bank on 
bluff to force the Pakistanis into utter quiescence. The kind of blind 
passions that frequently motivate Indians and Pakistanis can certainly 
make them act irrationally.
    
Remember 1947 saw the worlds greatest ethnic cleansing in the then 
India ever, with seven to eight million refugees moving in one direction 
and nine to 10 million moving in the other. The kind of decision 
Pakistani authorities made in 1971 cannot be called rational. The sort 
of blind hatred that motivates the mobs in a communal riots in India is 
not at all rational; politicians may calculatingly spark them off for 
political benefits, but those who kill act foolishly. Didnt responsible 
political leaders plan and had the Babri Masjid destroyed and then did 
not the large scale killings of religious minorities in 1984 (in 
retaliation of Mrs Indira Gandhis murder) and of over two thousand 
Indian Muslims after certain bomb blasts had rocked Bombay with many 
fatalities. Those who claim that Indian and Pakistanis are responsible 
and as cool and calculating as any western leader does not, in view of 
the experience, ring true. Both states are fundamentally brittle and 
vulnerable to not only secessionist movements but liable to produce 
political leaders that are too cynical, not to say unpredictable.
    
This writer believes that if Churchill, Stalin or Hitler had nuclear 
bombs, any of them would have used them in Europe. The US after all did 
it. No doubt many people believe that the US could not have nuked 
Germany as it did Japan for racial reason. One does not buy the racial 
argument. Arent Serbs and others in Balkan capable of making one 
another if only they can?
    
For Pakistan, the issue must be faced squarely about the Rupees, Annas 
and Pies. The kind of relationship the country now has with the IMF is, 
to put it bluntly, one of being in a court of wards. For, every decision 
and new policy is being vetted by the IMF and the World Bank. In 
essentials our budget is determined by the IMF. Our economic sovereignty 
is a myth. Every few weeks either a mission comes to take stock of how 
the government has behaved or Pakistani officials have to go and report 
compliance to world moneymen. Talking of an independent nuclear 
deterrent against the wishes of the international community is 
moonshine; so long as Pakistan is dependent on others for cash, those 
who plan a deterrent with borrowed money are being totally unrealistic.
    
Moreover there is no uncertainty that Pakistani hawks are not being led 
up the garden path. By going nuclear they are obliging Indian hawks no 
end; they would be paving the way for India to do what it has dearly 
wanted to do. It would provide a wonderful alibi to the Indian 
chauvinists to remove all stops and go nuclear full-scale.
   
While the Indians can, with some fortitude, hardship and difficulties, 
can ride out of the loud international outrage and censure, the same 
cannot be said for Pakistan. The kind of sanctions that such a step 
would invite will be so crippling and destabilising that it is difficult 
to countenance their effects. Try as one might, no positive benefit 
seems to be in store by the kind of recommendation that some of our 
hawks are making.

<a name="bein">Being grateful to our yobs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

HEROISM in the Islamic Republic is an enterprise fraught with the 
greatest risks. As the yobs and louts who make up our cricketing team 
will soon realise  that is, if the swift and cruel winds of nemesis 
have not touched and burnt them already  in this land of romance and 
eternal dreams the higher you rise the harder you fall.
    
If ever a team carried with it the prayers and hopes of an entire nation 
of 120 million souls (or given our gift for procreation, is it now 130?) 
it was the one which stepped on to the field at Bangalore. Pakistanis 
are an easily excited people at the best of times. But at Bangalore 
their team was not just trying to defend the World Cup which they had 
won four years ago at Melbourne. Nor was it simply trying to fight its 
way to the semi-finals. It was playing India in a knockout match and 
that meant stirring all the atavistic memories which are brought to the 
surface when India and Pakistan square off in any major encounter, 
whether on or off the playing field. Happy the day when both countries 
can learn to compete normally. But till it arrives they will have to 
live with the mutual intensity which adds so much colour and venom to 
their relationship.
    
It is small wonder then that had our yobs acquitted themselves well they 
would have won not just a crucial match but the 4th Battle of Panipat, 
demonstrating in the process that superiority which every true-blooded 
Pakistani is convinced their country enjoys over the land of Lalas and 
Brahmins. But since they stumbled and almost gave away the victory that 
for some time at least seemed to be within their grasp they have lost 
not just a match but betrayed the entire nation.
    
No sense of doom is ever complete without a search for scapegoats. If 
newspapers are to be believed, as soon as it became apparent that our 
hopes were about to mingle with the dust, there was a rush of callers 
venting their anger at what they considered to be the sources of our 
defeat. So low is the credibility of the national team that there were 
people (again according to Sunday mornings newspapers) who were not 
above thinking that the Pakistan captain Wasim Akram did not play in the 
match because of reasons other than his unfitness (meaning thereby that 
he had taken money to stay out of it). Some callers were of the outraged 
opinion that the lewd and unIslamic music and pop shows being shown 
by Pakistan Television as part of the World Cup buildup were responsible 
for the plight of the national team. A popular target of anger is also 
that egregious song hum jeetain gay (We will win) which was PTVs idea 
of raising the nations morale.
    
But far from being angry at our cricketing yobs the nation has reason to 
be grateful to them. Now that Pakistan has received its come-uppance 
from India (hard though it is to admit to this sentiment) there will 
hopefully be an end to the hype which has surrounded our cricketing 
effort and also to the arrogance of our leading cricketers. That 
sportsmen who distinguish themselves in their respective fields of 
endeavour deserve all the praise and money that they can get is 
something with which no one will quarrel. That cricketing is now a more 
lucrative venture than it was, say, two decades ago is also all to the 
good. At the same time, however, is it too much to ask that sporting 
heroes, especially our native ones, should be able to wear their 
greatness lightly?
    
Ever since they won the last World Cup four years ago, Pakistans 
cricketers have made a running spectacle of themselves by indulging 
constantly in infighting, factionalism, gross indiscipline and revolts 
against various captains and by lending themselves to the suspicion of 
throwing away games for the sake of money. The only thing that could 
have made up for this sustained loutishness would have been success on 
the playing field. But as aficionados of the game would know better than 
I, our cricketing ability has been going steadily downhill over the last 
four years.
    
When was the last time our team gave a good account of itself? And what 
sense is there in concluding that a team or rather a cricketing 
establishment devoid alike of purpose and spirit had a sporting chance 
to lift the World Cup once again? Spectacular performances do not just 
come out of the blue. They flow from good selection, rigorous training, 
motivation and team spirit  qualities conspicuously missing from our 
cricket over the last four years. Consequently, now that we have met our 
deserts at Bangalore, our managers right from the head of the cricketing 
board to Arif Abbassi deserve not just to be sacked for their 
maladroitness, because that would be too benign a punishment for them, 
but to be strapped and put on public display. As for the cricket team 
itself it deserves to be ignored for a while which for the big egos who 
make it up will be punishment more severe than any other in the world.
    
There is, accordingly, a kind of poetic justice in the defeat of the 
Pakistan side. Their victory would have brought joy to a nation which in 
other respects has so little to be genuinely happy about. But the 
downside of this is that the nation would have had to put up with the 
arrogance of these yobs for another four years, a prospect calculated to 
daunt the stoutest heart. Four more years of bragging and strutting 
about. And four more years of bad Coca-Cola and Pepsi commercials woven 
around the real and imagined prowess of these heroes. Defeat has a 
bitter taste especially on the morning after, but as time passes and we 
see a more chastened side, a side and an establishment more ready to 
accept the habits of modesty, we may come round to thinking, undoubtedly 
painful though the process would be, that some good has come from this 
defeat after all.
    
Since defeat is an orphan and victory an offspring with many parents, if 
we had won at Bangalore, many and varied are the people who would have 
claimed credit for it. Arif Abbassi and his crew would have considered 
their rank incompetence vindicated. Mr Asif Zardari, who is doing 
everything these days from cleaning up our ozone layer to bringing in 
foreign investment, would have thought his offer of plots and money to 
our players justified. Ms Raana Shaikh, PTVs energetic boss, would no 
doubt have thought that the asinine ditties and programmes being shown 
on PTV (hum jeetain gay and the rest of the sorry gang) had been 
instrumental in raising the teams spirits and the nations morale. And 
there would have been more Pepsi and Coca-Cola commercials. From all 
these hazards the nation has been saved.
    
Who knows from this experience the yobs of our cricket team may learn to 
conduct themselves as a team instead of as a bunch of egoists nursing 
their mercenary instincts. And while this may be too much to expect, 
they may even learn to play cricket for the glory of the game itself 
(old-fashioned as this concept may sound) than for more tangible things 
like residential plots and bagfuls of prize money which it is no small 
mercy they will have to do without on this occasion.

<a name="well">Well played Karachi</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Omar Kureishi
    
IT IS no secret that there were serious misgivings about Karachi as a 
venue for World Cup matches. There were fears about the security of the 
teams, there were concerns about law and order and it was entirely 
possible that an incident could have been created that would have 
disturbed the peace in the city.
    
It is no secret either that Karachi is perceived as a high risk city, 
the foreign media has been covering it with gusto, the BBC and CNN 
faithfully reporting whenever there has been trouble. Foreign travellers 
have been advised to give Karachi a miss. I know of many Pakistanis who 
live upcountry who are most reluctant to visit Karachi. I myself will 
avoid a late night flight because I would just as not risk going to the 
airport. When the Australians and the West Indians refused to play in 
Sri Lanka because they considered Colombo an unsafe city, many felt that 
it was only a matter of time before some visiting team decided they did 
not want to play in Karachi. Although there has been a perceptible 
improvement and the violence appears to have abated, we know that it 
only takes one spark.
    
There is still uneasiness and we walk on egg shells. Karachi is still a 
troubled city. Given this background, the reality on the ground, the 
temptation must have been there to take no chances with the World Cup. 
Had anything gone wrong, it would have derailed the tournament. I am 
glad that the temptation was resisted and the decision to go ahead with 
the matches taken. There was an element of gamble involved. It was 
Karachis moment of truth.
    
As we all know, the people of Karachi gave a befitting reply to the 
merchants of gloom. Not only were the matches played without any 
incident of any kind but the Karachi cricket public set a very high 
example for cricket crowds in other cities where the World Cup matches 
are being played. It was an exemplary crowd. What I liked best of all 
was that it was a good natured crowd and a very sporting one. It 
supported Pakistan vigorously, as it should, but it generously applauded 
the opponents, showing that it knew its cricket too.
    
The Delhi crowd, by contrast, showed itself to be shamelessly partisan 
and the TV commentators mentioned this obliquely. When a Sri Lankan 
batsman got to his fifty, there was pin-drop silence at the ground apart 
from the cheers raised by the few Sri Lanka supporters. When South 
Africa beat Pakistan, our public appreciated the high class cricket 
played by the visitors. Apart from being sporting, it was a patient 
crowd. The security arrangements were tight, too tight in my view but I 
was told that it was necessary and about which I am not convinced. Be 
that as it may, the crowd did not show their resentment though they must 
have been inconvenienced. They were searched, or frisked in popular 
parlance, and they were forbidden to take any kind of foodstuff into the 
ground. A lady had a bar of chocolate confiscated and another had 
brought a sandwich with him and rather than have it confiscated he ate 
it there and then. The crowd was thus put at the mercy of those who had 
been given the franchise to sell food items at the ground. A cricket 
match is a family outing and people pack their lunches and have a sort 
of picnic. Sometimes, in the past, I would be invited to share a meal 
during the lunch break and it was great fun. In this respect, the 
matches were austere. Still it did not damp the enthusiasm of the people 
who went to the ground in such large numbers.
    
I have been going to the National Stadium for many years, covering 
cricket. I have often despaired of sections of the crowd whose idea of 
exuberance was hooliganism. Many a match has been disrupted in Karachi 
because the crowd went out of control. I worried on this account as 
well. Not this time. It was an impeccably disciplined crowd. No one 
walked in front of the sight screen, a fairly common occurrence, not 
even a policeman. And when the matches were over, the crowd dispersed 
and drifted away. Pakistan had lost the first match but there was no 
public expression of disappointment, not even a few well-chosen 
expletives that would have been justified, if not deserved.
    
All in all it was a wonderful show. But where do we go from here? I 
think the cricket has provided us with an opportunity to bring Karachi 
back on the rails. The capacity to have fun is still there. I thought 
one would never see such a large crowd in Karachi, a crowd that had not 
been rented, but one which was of diverse political opinion, act with 
such a sense of responsibility and indeed dignity. Although South Africa 
and England had their supporters, the crowd was overwhelmingly cheering 
for Pakistan. I have always believed that we come together as a nation 
whenever our cricket team is playing. On the surface it seems like a 
frivolous observation. But the World Cup has shown that despite 
difference, we all want Pakistan to win. This is something positive. The 
idea of being one people is very much alive.
    
Admittedly, not much work is getting done during the World Cup. People 
are either at the matches or glued to their television and radio sets. 
Wherever one goes, the talk is about cricket and nothing else. This may 
seem to be a waste of time but it is infinitely more healthy than 
strikes and all the other activities that bring the country to a 
standstill.
    
A day after the England match, the Governor of Sindh, Mr Kamaluddin 
Azfar invited me to lunch. It was in honour of a visiting British 
delegation. they had gone to the match and although England had lost, 
they were full of praise for the Karachi crowd. Also present at the 
lunch was the Interior Minister Gen. Naseerullah Babar. I had a long 
chat with him and he told me that not only should the Karachi crowd be 
given the Man of the Match award but they should be given a Pride of 
Performance medal. I told him that it was an excellent idea and there 
was a need to put the bitterness behind us, to mend fences and bring 
Karachi back to its rightful place as the first city of Pakistan. He 
agreed wholeheartedly.
    
Cricket has provided a perfect platform. Now it is upto the politicians 
to carry the ball. One must never forget that the breakthrough in China-
USA relations, which were far from friendly and verged on outright 
hostility was provided by ping-pong diplomacy. Why cant a cricket crowd 
bring the warring factions together? Many of us who have been writing 
about the situation in Karachi have stressed over and over that the 
majority of the people in this city want to live in peace and go to a 
cricket match, if they want to, without fear. The point has been proved.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="cric">Cricket put on global map, say Cup chiefs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   
CALCUTTA, March: Delighted World Cup chiefs believe they have put 
cricket on the global map and given it the perfect chance to challenge 
other major sports for international exposure.
    
Their confidence is such that they are already declaring the event a 
huge success even before the climax and hailing it a watershed in the 
games move into the big league.
    
Weve globalised cricket like never before, said Amrit Mathur, a 
member of the joint Pakistan-India-Lanka organising committee (PILCOM).
    
I think the introduction of 12 teams has been a success, he said. I 
think with the United Arab Emirates, Holland and Kenya getting such 
international attention, other developing cricket nations would now try 
harder to qualify for the World Cup.
    
Mathur went on: Cricket has to battle with such established sports as 
golf, tennis and soccer for media attention. We are still a long way 
away from competing with them, but at least a start has been made.
    
I dont see the cricket World Cup expanding to 32 teams in the near 
future, like its happened in football. Not in the next 20 years at 
least.

The event has not been without hitches, however.
    
First there was the security concerns which led to unprecedented match 
boycotts by Australia and the West Indies.
    
Then South Africa and Zimbabwe called for a change in the format, 
arguing  despite the success of Kenya in particular, who beat the West 
Indies in one of the biggest shocks in the cups 21-year-history  that 
many early games against the qualifiers were devoid of drama.
    
The huge geographical distances needed to be covered by sides have also 
been unappreciated, while the lack of crowd support in Pakistan reduced 
most games not including the host country to a deathly hush  including 
the quarter-final between England and Sri Lanka at Faisalabad.

<a name="adef">A defective format for the competition</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Samiul Hasan
    
THE 6th World Cup would be remembered for long for many reasons; 
Pakistan losing to India in the quarter-finals by 39 runs, Australia and 
West Indies refusing to play in Sri Lanka, Javed Miandad appearing for 
the 6th consecutive time since 1975, Sri Lankas all-time highest score 
in one-dayers against Kenya, explosive batting displays by Sanath 
Jayasuriya, Kenyas shock win over West Indies, controversy around 
Australia-West Indies league match etc.
    
It will also be remembered for the fact that this was the second time 
India-Pakistan were hosting the mega event taking it into Sri Lanka and 
including them as co-hosts. However, the subcontinent might not earn 
this honour for almost a couple of decades as the World Cup would in 
future be hosted on a rota basis.
    
Yet another thing for which this World Cup might be remembered for long 
is the format that has generated considerable debate.
    
This is not the first time the defective format has reflected adversely 
on this premier competition. The 5th World Cup, co-hosted by Australia-
New Zealand, had experienced similar oddities heightened by the 
ridiculous situation in which South Africans, on the verge of victory 
needing 22 runs off 13 balls, were made to score 22 off just one 
delivery following rains and were deprived of the right to play the 
final.
    
Sports organisers and policy-makers have to look after a host of things. 
That is their job. Most important of these include policies and plans to 
promote the game and to help achieve ever-higher standards.
    
The format of a tournament acquires special place in this context, and 
it goes without saying that they seem to have left much to be desired in 
this respect both for the 5th World Cup and the 6th.
    
To begin with, the best points of the 4th and 5th World Cups changed 
without any rhyme or reason and that resulted in Pakistan-India quarter-
finals clash at Bangalore on Saturday. In the 1987 and 1992 World Cups, 
the host teams, if they qualify, were to play their sudden-death match 
in their country. Consequently, Pakistan played the 1987 semi-finals at 
Lahore against Australia and India took England at Bombay. Similarly, in 
the 1992 World Cup, New Zealand faced Pakistan at Wellington and though 
Australia could not make to the last four, England and South Africa 
(after finishing second and third) met at Sydney.
    
Then, while preparing the draws of this World Cup, the decision-makers 
did not take into account the performances of the teams in the previous 
World Cup. As a result, all the four semi-finalists of the 1992 event 
were placed in Group B alongwith two qualifiers (Emirates Cricket Board 
and Holland) while all the teams who couldnt finish in the top four 
were put in Group A with Kenya as the third qualifier.
    
The format designed for the World Cup exposed the lack of knowledge of 
the officials of the people who control cricket in Pakistan. Now compare 
them with the thorough professionalism of the Indian officials and one 
would find that local organisers have still a lot to learn from the 
neighbouring cricket board. The Indian organisers kept provision for a 
loss in the league games and thus, kept the No 2 and No 3 teams of Group 
A in their country. Pakistani officials, on the other hand, failed to 
realise the complexities of it quite naively agreed upon to keep the No 
1 and No 4 teams in the country. Therefore, India (with two league 
defeats) played Pakistan (with one defeat) at Bangalore and fully cashed 
in on the home advantage to score 288 and then restrict Pakistan to 249 
in 49 overs.
    
Then, nobody ever anticipated a situation where a competing team would 
back out and concede a walk-over and two `valuable points. The 6th 
World Cup experience would make them wiser. Australia and West Indies 
had little hesitation in conceding the walk-overs and the two points 
because they did not apprehend any setbacks or problems in making the 
quarter-finals stage. That is the major defect of this format and the 
planner failed exactly for that reason.
    
If the format and rules of the competition had also provided for two 
penalty points (in addition to walk-over points), the situation would 
have been totally different. But the biggest criticism of the format 
came when manager Intikhab Alam presented the hypothetical situation of 
Pakistan having an opportunity of playing the quarter-finals at the home 
ground (Faisalabad) by throwing away their two games against England and 
New Zealand.
    
This was allegedly put into practice at the controversial Australia-West 
Indies game and the Aussies, according to critics, did not give their 
best and meekly surrendered to West Indies implying thereby that they 
rewarded them for having gone along on the decision not to play matches 
in Sri Lanka. This allegation is on the ground that in the event of a 
West Indian defeat, Kenya would have automatically qualified for the 
quarter-finals as they had already defeated the West Indies in the 
preliminary round match.
    
Intikhabs views and the Jaipur match are not the contentious issues. 
The crux of the matter is that the format did not oblige the teams to 
give their best at each outing.
    
Any format which does not extract the best from the players and the 
teams reflects adversely on the competence of those behind such a game-
plan.
    
The cause of cricket and in fact, all other sports and performing arts 
is best served when conditions conducive to super-human performances are 
created. Nothing would, however, work unless there is a top class format 
to extract the last ounce of energy from each competitor and the teams. 
That is where this World Cup, like the previous one, failed miserably.
    
A relevant point in this connection is the schedule of matches. During 
the league ties, there were up to three matches on a single day, and at 
the sudden-death stage there were two quarter-finals on each day (March 
9 and 11).
    
Cricket fans all over the world would be particularly watching the 
proceedings of the quarter-finals but were denied it as the transmission 
covered one and ignored the other.
    
The planners could have easily scheduled a match each dayfrom March 8 
or 9 onwards. Even if there was another day added to the schedule, 
heavens would not have fallen. Also, it would have been in the fitness 
of things if Sri Lanka, as co-hosts, had staged at least one quarter-
finals (the one that was played at Faisalabad), while India staging both 
the semi-finals should have shared it with Pakistan. That would have 
been a more equitable sharing of the matches of this tournament.
    
There is no doubt that the men at the helm of affairs of cricket in the 
nine top-class Test playing countries and the others (three of whom made 
the World Cup qualifiers) have been extremely harsh to the millions of 
the cricket lovers all over the world.
    
The lesson to be learnt from it is that the thinking on the rules and 
the format for the next World Cup must begin right away; it must be 
entrusted to persons who specialise in this particular job and not 
necessarily to the ones who run the boards and manage cricket affairs 
otherwise.
    
In fact, one-day cricket has brought revolution to the game in all 
respects. There is need to acknowledge the wind of change and the 
challenge thereof and constitute experts committees to go into all 
related matters and problems in order to accelerate the pace of this 
cricket revolution.
    
It is in this context one sympathises with Kenyans who narrowly missed 
the chance to make historic entry into the quarter-finals. West Indies 
exit from the World Cup in the qualifying round would have not destroyed 
cricket in the Caribbeans. Kenyas qualification would have perhaps 
generated cricket fever in that country to enable it to attain Test 
status by the year 2000 or thereabouts. It is the loss to cricket. If 
the defective format had any role in Kenyas elimination in the league, 
its like killing a baby before its birth.

<a name="aban">A bang ends in a whimper</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Tanvir Ahmad
   
BANGALORE: How high the Pakistan team was rated here before the first 
knock-out match of this World Cup is amply evident from a report in the 
Times by Indias Bangalore correspondent, which begins: India exceeded 
all expectations today. They defeated Pakistan in an emphatic 
fashion....
    
Both observations are full truths. When the Pakistanis arrived here on 
Thursday on the all important leg of their title campaign, they were 
greeted with awe and respect. Local newspapers billed them as hard nuts 
to crack and the bookmakers rated them as firm favourites for the 
Saturday match.
    
Cricket experts, gathered in this beautiful, lush green South Indian 
city from all over India, described the match as the real final of 
this World Cup. A Hindi newspaper said: Today will be the Maha Yudh 
(great battle) of cricket. India will have a difficult time to contain 
batsmen like Aamir, Saeed Anwar, Ejaz and Inzamam with Salim and Miandad 
making the rearguard. A local English language daily dubbed it as the 
Mother of all matches (of this World Cup).
    
What started with a bang, ended in a whimper with Pakistan subdued by a 
comparatively less penetrative Indian attack. In fact, Pakistan, for all 
intents and purposes, had surrendered in the 25th over and from then on 
Malik and Miandad simply went through the actions. In between 
wicketkeeper Rashid Latif tried to lift the morale by hitting Srinath 
over the fence collecting 13 runs from the Indian seamers 8th over. 
When he was out in the 42nd over at 231, the curtains were finally 
drawn.
    
To attribute the submission  for that is what it was  to the absence 
of Wasim Akram would be self-deception. Pakistan has in the past also 
played without him and Waqar Younus and Aqib Javed have not only shared 
the burden but have done the job for their team. The official version 
would like to divert the attention from the real reasons to this aspect 
and many of us may be carried away by it.
    
Pakistan, after all, won the 1992 World Cup without Waqar Younis. At 
that time Wasim, Aqib, Aamir Sohail and Mushtaq took Pakistan through to 
the title. This time Waqar was there and also the rest but Pakistan 
failed to contain India at the most crucial stage  the last 5 overs 
made all the difference in the end.
    
One was baffled to observe the difference in the two sessions, the first 
40 overs and the last 10 overs, and was unable to comprehend what bad 
omen had struck the bowlers and the fielders.
    
Frankly, the quality of fielding in this match was well up to the mark, 
Pakistan not allowing India to score at more than 4 runs an over in the 
first 10 overs when Sidhu and Tendulkar were at the crease. To restrain 
the Indian run-machine was a good job done by the Pakistanis. Later on, 
as the innings progressed, the run rate slowly went up reaching 4.70 in 
the 40th over, but India had lost Tendulkar, Majrekar and Sidhu. At 200 
they lost Azhar in the 42nd over. There was jubilation among the 
Pakistan supporters (and dont be surprised  there were quite a large 
number of them here) and a hushed silence fell over the ground.
    
What followed was simply amazing and unbelievable. The fielding fell to 
pieces. Waqar completely lost his rhythm while Aqib, who in any case was 
not bowling at his best in this match, and Ataur Rahman simply panicked 
against Jadejas onslaught. These 8 overs, which saw India come out of 
the woods to pile up their highest-ever in a one-day game against 
Pakistan, were the real test and the boys failed in it. Surprisingly 
with four former captains in the field at that crucial juncture, none 
was able to revise the strategy to stop India.
    
They say that a one-dayer is not decided till the last ball is bowled. 
For those of us in the media centre at the Chinnaswamy Stadium, India 
had already won half the battle.
    
Chasing anything over 250 needs planning at every stage. batting in the 
first 10 overs had to be different and once a run rate of something like 
over 7 runs is established, the batsmen have to consolidate, and be 
content with something like 4 an over. After 25 overs the pace is again 
accelerated so that the required run rate does not go beyond 6 to make 
things difficult if a few quick wickets fall.
    
Pakistan never planned their innings while tackling the huge 288 run 
target. Run chase under flood lights is in any case difficult than in 
day light. For this reason alone Azhar opted to bat after winning the 
toss. Sohail and his senior team-mates and the manager appeared 
oblivious of this fact. The openers made a scintillating start, 
collecting 84 runs in first 10 overs. this was time to apply the brakes 
and put pressure on the Indian fielding by taking singles and twos. But 
the acting skipper was probably thinking of hitting out all those 288 
runs himself alongwith his partner. Or he had no faith in those who were 
to follow. He lost his wicket as if in a hurry and then Ejaz and 
Inzamam, caught in the same frenzy, went out cheaply. With four top 
order batsmen gone, pressure had now started mounting.
    
It is a mystery as to what was bugging the Pakistani batsmen at 130 runs 
in 20 overs with Inzamam batting and Malik, Miandad and Rashid to 
follow.
    
The only conclusion one can draw is that the team played in a reckless 
manner, had not planned to meet the various eventualities and probably 
the leadership was confused as well.
    
Or is it that they relaxed, first when they had contained India at 200 
(in 40 overs) and again when the Pakistani openers had hoisted 84 in 
first 10 overs and thought they had won the match.
    
I would like to give Azhar full marks for his leadership. He was 
concerned but not confused when he lost Tendulkar and Manjrekar rather 
early. He also kept his cool when Aamir and Saeed went on the rampage. 
That made all the difference in the world.

<a name="lack">Lack of leadership led to Bangalore fiasco</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By S.A. Meenai
   
Following the wave of lamentations and lashing fury sweeping Pakistan 
after the Bangalore fiasco in which factors other than cricket find 
pronounced expression, it will be proper though difficult to analyse the 
defeat mainly in terms of field performance.
    
At the very outset certain quirks of fate queered the pitch for the 
visiting team. The skippers decision to skip the vital match was 
virtually a knock-out blow that completely upset whatever combat 
strategy or battle plan might have been drawn. It meant that Pakistan 
had not only to play without their key bowler and best all-rounder but 
minus the leader.
    
The loss of toss was another stroke of bad luck. Batting second on a 
slow wicket in flood-light - to which they were not very well-attuned - 
posed a difficult proposition. Added to this a huge and hostile crowd 
not only rooting for home side but hooting the one opposite, stretched 
gangled nerves to the utmost limit.
    
All these unfavourable conditions and climate, notwithstanding, there 
was no justification for the faults of omission and commission that led 
to the ultimate ruin and reverse. While it is unfair, particularly in a 
team game like cricket, to pinpoint any one person or player for a 
setback, the brunt of the blame in this case lies on Amir Sohail, the 
acting captain, who utterly failed to stem the tide when the going was 
rough or steer the side to success when it seemed within grasp.
    
Specifically, when Waqar Yunus and Aquib Javed were bowling their last 
overs and Jadeja was enjoying the feast of runs at their expense, 
irrevocably imperilling the chances of Pakistan, Amir appeared to be a 
helpless spectator instead of a sensible guide. If he found himself at 
his wits and, he should have consulted Javed Miandad or Salim Malik. 
This lapse on his part was serious enough. But what followed was simply 
inexcusable.
    
True the two most experienced fast bowlers could not be absolved as 
their costly ineptitude knew no bounds. Yet Providence provided an ideal 
chance for Amir to repair the damage when he and Anwar Saeed were 
hammering Indias attack almost as they pleased. It seemed that what 
Waqar and Aquib had squandered with their right hand would be saved by 
this left-handed opening pair. Such seeming prospects, however, proved 
to be illusory as both of them simultaneously lost their head, their 
wickets and the match.
    
The batsmen to follow though seasoned were so shaken by this 
inexplicable indiscretion that they succumbed to a moderate Indian 
attack almost without a fight. Thus was ignominiously thrown away the 
World Cup crown that was so gloriously earned in Melbourne four years 
ago.
    
This critical assessment of the Bangalore battle will remain incomplete 
without a brief reference to Javid Miandads last appearance. His 
inclusion in the team after the pathetic performance in Karachi was 
presumably as a cricket brain rather than as a batsman who in his prime 
could and did play a decisive part in many epic encounters. But by 
placing him on the boundary line, the captain not only subjected him to 
an unfair trial at his age, but also signalled a message that he had no 
intention of soliciting the shrewd veterans advice.
    
This sort of unwarranted presumptuousness bordering on arrogance in fact 
was also one of the root causes of the miserable failure against India 
as also the despondency that has gripped the nation after the Bangalore 
debacle. But that is another story.

<a name="endo">End of road looms for Miandad</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

BANGALORE, March 8: If anyone is a cricketing Houdini it must be Javed 
Miandad. Comebacks, escape acts and outrageous stunts are his bread and 
butter, so much so that rumours of a permanent exit sound like yet 
another illusion.
    
But the man himself insists he will be gone for good after this World 
Cup is done, which for Pakistan or India will be in Bangalore, a fast-
growing city enthralled by the potential drama on its doorstep.
    
Defeat will involve a massive loss of face and public humiliation for 
the losers, which makes some degree of controversy almost inevitable. If 
it does turn out to be Javeds final throw, he could not have wished for 
a more loaded set of dice.
    
Too many tears for the man responsible for one of crickets most 
unsavoury incidents  his infamous bat-wielding at Australian fast 
bowler Dennis Lillee  would be inappropriate and Javed has never been 
one for gushing accolades.
    
He would far rather be remembered as a thorn in the side of all his 
opponents, an artful dodger who developed into a lovable rogue. Most of 
Pakistans rivals, and some within his own dressing-room, will dispute 
the lovable bit, but none can deny his competitiveness.
    
This tournament has been a classic illustration of precisely that. 
Selected for a record-breaking sixth World Cup in what was widely 
rumoured as a political move to take him past Imran Khan, Miandad has 
struggled for a big score and has had to endure persistent questions 
about his fitness.
    
In the nets he had his stumps immediately rearranged by Waqar Younis, 
but reacted as though the bowler had merely happened to hit an extra set 
secretly erected by the groundsman without his knowledge.
    
More than 1,000 World Cup runs have clearly given him the confidence to 
ignore such trifles, and he seems more concerned with reminding younger 
players of their place in crickets pecking order.
    
The quality of cricket has come down, no doubt about it, he said. 
There was a time when every team had a bunch of fine players. That is 
not the case any more.
 
It is a debatable argument, particularly given the current strength of 
his own team, but Pakistan coach Intikhab Alam is adamant Miandad 
remains a positive influence within the squad.
    
There is no doubt about his ability, the only question was about his 
fitness, said Intikhab, recalling Miandads two-year absence with a 
serious leg injury. Hes a true team man.
    
After 124 tests, 34 as captain, and more than 230 one-day 
internationals, it would be more accurate to say that Javed, 38, knows 
precisely what makes Pakistan cricket tick. Volatile is an 
understatement and only the thick-skinned or quick-witted last long.

If we are not divided we are not content, Javed said with a laugh 
recently. But sometimes I think it is a miracle we can do so well in 
spite of all the problems.
    
Pakistans progress to the knock-out stages, even allowing for a group 
defeat by South Africa and the side strain affecting captain Wasim 
Akram, has been almost serene by their normal standards, which only adds 
to the air of expectancy ahead of their day-night Indian showdown.

For Miandad the streetfighter, the end of the road is finally in sight.

<a name="theg">The great pressure of expectations</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Memon

Is it one of the quirks of cricket that all the four semi-finals of this 
World Cup should be from Group A, or is there a genuine cricketing 
reason (whatever that may mean)?
    
In a matter of two days, England  weary, woeful, mournful England  
were flattened by beef-enriched Sri Lanka, cocky Pakistan had their ego-
deflated by traditional bakras India, strong South Africa were swept 
aside by a resurgent West Indies, and New Zealand were put firmly in 
their place by the thoroughly professional Aussies. So what went wrong 
with Group B?
    
There are various theories put forward by sundry critics, but strangely 
not one examines the role spectators can play in enhancing (or 
diminishing) a teams performance. It might sound facetious, but I think 
the teams which played most of their matches in Pakistan suffered 
because of very poor spectator response.
    
Many cricketers and managers complain about pressures of expectations, 
but this pressure has undeniable uses. The best players reserve their 
best for the big occasion. The big occasion means when there are large 
audiences, who edge mediocre players on to great deeds, or can deter the 
seemingly great from doing their wont.
    
Teams which played in Pakistan, coasted through their games. There was 
no pressure of expectation, no public scrutiny, no instant post-mortems, 
no feedbacks, no debate. While Group A was fraught with high drama and 
tension, Group B remained insipid and tepid.
    
Englands most daring act was in beating Holland and UAE, Pakistan got 
terribly involved in the melodrama about Javed Miandads batting 
position. And who had heard anything about New Zealand till they arrived 
at Madras a few days ago?
    
Match that with the trauma of Richie Richardsons side, Indias sudden 
slump which saw them lose two games then recover, and Sri Lankas 
lingering anger at being snubbed by Australia and the West Indies, to 
realise why teams from Group A were keener hungrier for success.
    
As a spectator of sorts, I know what role audiences have played in 
ensuring the high drama of matches played in India. When Pakistan came 
to Bangalore, they were hardly prepared for the pressure from a 50,000 
crowd, or a fiercely determined Indian side. They relied on history to 
see them through, but they should have realised this was not Sharjah, 
leave aside Karachi.
    
Would it have been different if the teams from both Group had criss-
crossed and played both in India and Pakistan? Certainly, there would 
have been better audience in Pakistan. 
   
There might have been some political jugglery to do, but as the 
Bangalore quarter-final showed, where theres a will, theres a way for 
Pakistan to play in India, or the other way around. Think of the bonanza 
for the cricket lovers  Pakistan versus South Africa at Calcutta, and 
India versus Australia at Lahore!
    
Instead, we were fortuitously pitted against each other for one match, 
after which political skulduggery has taken over. 
   
The Pakistan players have been threatened with dire consequences, and 
the government has ordered an inquiry into their defeat against India. 
Wholly foolish, these sentiments.
    
Frankly, Pakistan got what they deserved. The two most disappointing 
teams in Group B were England and Pakistan. England appear to have 
suffered from overtheorising under Ray Illingworth. But mere theory is 
never enough. At any given time, you need a full complement of fit 
players. And these players need to show some derring-do occasionally.
    
Pakistan, on the other hand, suffered from an overdose of adrenalin. 
When the occasion demanded circumspection and a cool head, they plunged 
in with passion, daring and not a little foolhardiness.
    
The complaint about Englands players is that they get tamed too easily, 
lack spark; about Pakistan that they are mercurial, gifted but wholly 
individualistic, and uncontrollable except by a tyrant or a towelling 
personality who can command respect.
    
I dont know what can help English cricket, but Pakistan have a ready 
remedy. 
   
If Imran Khan can be convinced that managing a cricket team could be as 
challenging as pursuing a political career (in the subcontinent, often 
one actually means the other), there is hope for a quick turnaround.
    
And nobody is saying that Imran Khan is a tyrant.

<a name="runs">Runs & records but no excitement</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Memon
   
IN the first fortnight the World Cup lacked the three vital ingredients 
to make it come alive  a close contest, an upset, and a controversy 
involving Javed Miandad. By the end of the third week, each of these 
events had happened, and all was well with the cricketing world.
    
For two weeks, there had been too many one-sided matches, strong teams 
had cake walked over the so-called minnows, the major batsmen and 
bowlers had made easy pickings. There had been results, runs and 
records. But no drama and little excitement to justify the hype that 
this was the greatest sports show of the decade.
    
An enthralling India-Australia match under brilliant floodlights at the 
Wankhede dissipated the humdrumness of the tournament till then, gave it 
the kiss of life, as it were. There was the majestic batsmanship of Mark 
Waugh and Sachin Tendulkar to savour, the speed and spirit of Damien 
Fleming to admire, and the guile and genius of Shane Warne to marvel at. 
It was a close game which had millions of viewers worldwide glued to 
their TV sets, and giving their assent that this was now the real 
thing. The World Cup had finally arrived.
    
Two days later, the West Indies virtually signed their departure from 
the tournament. The stunning win by Kenya had critics hurling shards or 
sympathy at Richie Richardsons beleaguered side. The West Indies became 
easy game for these head-hunters, which critics reckoned had come to 
India only on a goodwill, learning mission. Unbelievable, insane.
    
But, forget cricketing reputation and logic, better believe it, for this 
is the World Cup. Remember Australia in 1983 and England in 1992, both 
victims of Zimbabwes enthusiasm, and carefree play? And can anybody in 
India forget the fateful day, June 25, 1983 when the mighty West Indies 
were humbled in the Prudential Cup final. When it comes to the World 
Cup, the David and Goliath saga is revisited many times.
    
Meanwhile, on the same day that the West Indies were getting their noses 
rubbed into the Pune Stadium ground, across the border Javed Miandad was 
stirring up a hornets nest. No complaints. This was sorely needed for 
what is a World Cup without calumny and controversy.
    
The refusal of Australia and the West Indies to play in Sri Lanka was 
now old hat. Stories about the life and loves of Mohammed Azharuddin had 
become predictable and boring. Mike Atherton made a valiant attempt to 
inject some pep by redefining a journalist as buffoon, but had his bluff 
called and apologised abjectly the next day. There was surely need for 
some spice. Enter Miandad.
    
Those uninitiated into the ways of this game may not know that there are 
players and personalities. And there are some personalities who always 
court trouble, even if not of their own making.
 
Javed Miandad and controversy go hand-in-hand Great batsman he surely 
is, but even greater rabble-rouser though whether this should be viewed 
negatively is open to interpretation. Had he been an Englishman, he 
would have usurped W.G. Graces position as the most colourful 
personality to have ever played cricket. Being only a Pakistani, he is 
viewed less generously, often disparagingly.
    
Of course, he was going to demand his number four batting position and a 
greater say in the team strategy. If Wasim Akram and Intikhab Alam did 
not know this, they were being naive. If not this, then Miandad would 
have asked for something else. The point is that if Miandad is 
contented, he wouldnt be Miandad. And if Miandad is not Miandad, can 
there be a wholesome, enjoyable World Cup?
    
So there we are, this crazy cricket carousel called the World Cup 
entering into its last fortnight, the three essential conditions 
fulfilled, and now progressing at a gallop towards its climax. The 
excitement is at fever pitch, and if the results of the two matches 
played in the last couple of days is any indication, there is tremendous 
drama in store.
    
Sri Lanka, for instance, overwhelmed India with the most sizzling 
batting display at Delhi on Saturday, and Pakistan, in spite of the 
Kabhi haan-kabhi Na syndrome of confused Intikhab Alam, finally did 
not tank their game against England. That is two unexpected events on 
successive days, and perhaps a portent of things to come.
    
How about a devious Anglo-Caribbean conspiracy which speaks of lulling 
every opponent into complacency, and setting up a date to meet in Lahore 
on March 17?
    
May sound far-fetched. But this is after all, the World Cup where 
strange things are known to happen. The disbelieving can consult Mr 
Kapil Dev or Mr Imran Khan.
