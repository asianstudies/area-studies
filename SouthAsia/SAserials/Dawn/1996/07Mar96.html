<A NAME="sepa">Separation of judiciary Law on way to remove perceived hurdles</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.Ziauddin 

ISLAMABAD, March 3: The government has finalised a draft ordinance to 
amend the Law Reforms Ordinance (LRO) 72 to remove what are perceived 
as executional hurdles in the way of implementing the Supreme Court 
order to separate judiciary from the executive by March 23.

While details of the draft ordinance are being kept a closely guarded 
secret, informed sources indicated that the issues such as financial 
powers of the judiciary and field level relationship between the 
executive and judiciary have been taken into consideration.

The executive reportedly feels that in view of the already serious 
resource constraint confronting the country, it would only create 
additional financial problems for the government if the judiciary is 
given unhindered spending powers without first assessing the actual 
resources the government can spare to buttress the judiciary s own 
meagre income.

Also, the government wants to avert situations where the role of the 
executive in meeting street emergencies like eruption of violence and 
threat to public life and property from unruly crowds, would have to 
be put off just because the judicial magistrate is not available on 
the spot.

Therefore, the draft ordinance is understood to have proposed the 
creation of the post of executive magistrates functioning under deputy 
commissioners in order to be able to perform the role of  fire-
fighters  on the spot.

After the initial emergency, the judicial magistrate would take over 
and from then onwards the judiciary would be completely independent of 
the executive, according to the proposed ordinance.

Informed sources said a final decision on the draft was likely by the 
end of this week, after which President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari 
would be consulted once again on promulgation details.

The sources said the input of the president and PM in the process of 
finalising a consensus draft had been try crucial as well as 
substantial.

<A NAME="uste">US terms violence in Karachi a political dispute</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent 

WASHINGTON, Mar 4: The United States has once again expressed its 
 deep concern  over the continuing violence and human rights 
violations in Karachi which, it says, is a  political dispute  between 
the Mohajir Qaumi Movement and the government.
    
 At its foundation, the violence in Karachi stems from a political 
dispute between the MQM and the government of Pakistan,  Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said in a letter sent on his behalf to the 
chairman of the Council of Pakistani Organisations, Miraj Haq Siddiqi.
    
Observers said the description of the Karachi problem as a domestic 
political dispute was in sharp conflict with the stand taken by the 
Benazir Bhutto government which describes it as a problem of terrorism 
aided by a foreign hand.
    
The state department, expressing concern on the continuing violence 
and human rights violations in Karachi, said:  According to credible 
reports, human rights abuses committed by the government security 
forces against MQM members increased during the past year (1995), 
including use of torture, staged encounter killings and custodial 
deaths. 
    
It also mentioned other reports which said:  MQM members have also 
perpetrated violent crimes and human rights abuses, aimed for the most 
part at the security forces and at the breakaway Haqiqi faction of the 
MQM. 
    
Stating categorically that the state department considered the MQM  to 
be a legitimate Pakistani political party , the US urged both the 
sides to show restraint and encouraged them to find a political 
solution to the fighting in Karachi.
    
It said since Nov. 30, 1994, when the Pakistani army ended  operation 
clean-up , violence in Karachi had increased sharply, with over 1,800 
deaths during 1995. By comparison, it said, there were 800 politically 
motivated killings in Karachi in all of 1994.

<A NAME="anti">Anti-narcotics efforts : US waives sanctions against Islamabad</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, March 1: President Clinton found Pakistan wanting in 
counter-narcotics efforts but waived sanctions against Islamabad  in 
the vital US national interest  which meant US assistance to Pakistan 
would continue.
    
The annual certification by the President came as he denied Columbia 
the required certification thereby blocking all US assistance and aid 
while Mexico was determined to be co-operating fully with US anti-drug 
efforts.
    
The President certification for Pakistan was the same as last year, 
diplomats said, adding that co-operation between the two countries 
would continue, despite the President s remarks.
    
Lebanon and Paraguay were also placed in the same category as Pakistan 
against which sanctions were waived but Peru and Bolivia were removed 
from this list and given full certification of good behaviour.
    
The President s certification and waiver coincided with the State 
Department Annual Report on International Narcotics Control Strategy 
which talked of a master plan for Pakistan to completely stop opium 
production and make the country drug-free by year 2000.
    
The certification by the President would enable Islamabad to receive 
US assistance for narcotic control in 1996.
    
The 1995 drug control strategy report issued by the State Department 
coinciding with the President s certification said poppy cultivation 
had risen significantly in Southwest Asia in 1995 but most of the 
increase was in Afghanistan.
    
According to the report, Pakistan received 2.5 million dollars as 
assistance for narcotics control in 1995 while in 1996 the amount 
would remain the same, increasing to three million dollars in 1997.
    
The certification process is required under Section 490 of the Foreign 
Assistance Act of 1961 and requires the President to prepare a list of 
the major drug producing and transit countries and withhold US 
government foreign assistance to them until the President certifies.
    
The law gives the President three choices: certify fully, deny 
certification, or give a  vital national interests  certification, 
which Pakistan got.
    
In addition, the US must vote against any loans from six multilateral 
development banks. The President also has the discretion during the 
year to impose trade and other economic sanctions.

<A NAME="rise">Rise in Indian defence budget : Pakistan voices grave concern</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hasan Akhtar 

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 29: The foreign ministry, commenting on the reported 
increase of up to 10 per cent in the Indian defence budget during the 
coming fiscal year, maintained that such a step would only go to 
augment the unfavourable military balance for Pakistan and would 
jeopardise its security.
    
A ministry spokesman, answering questions at his regular news briefing 
at the foreign office, drew the attention of the correspondents to the 
existing difference in the ratio of military expenditures of Pakistan 
and India which was about two-and-a-half times larger in India s 
favour.
   
He made a detailed statement on observations made by Indian President 
Shanker Dayal Sharma about worsening relations between India and 
Pakistan, holding Pakistan responsible, and asserted that India s 
mounting repression in the held Kashmir and massive armament, missiles 
and contemplated nuclear arms testing programmes clearly demonstrated 
that  it is India which has embarked on a path of confrontation  
against Pakistan.

The spokesman recalled that India had still not responded 
constructively and positively to Pakistan s repeated offers of 
 meaningful and result-oriented talks  nor does the Indian president 
seem  inclined to acknowledge the obvious that by deploying 600,000 
troops in Jammu and Kashmir and by threatening war against Pakistan, 
it is India which has embarked on a path of confrontation. 
    
He pointed out that the average ratio of Pakistani and Indian armed 
forces comes to 1 to 2.5, and only recently India proposed 10 per cent 
increase in its defence budget which already far exceeded its 
legitimate defence requirements.

<A NAME="indi">Indigenous reactor ready</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
>From Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, March 6: Pakistan has completed its first 50-megawatt multi-
purpose nuclear power reactor made entirely by Pakistani scientists 
and engineers.
    
Set up near Khushab in the Punjab, the reactor is ready for fuelling, 
Dawn learnt through competent sources. A decision about when to 
operate the project will be taken soon.

Pakistan already has a 137-mw nuclear power plant in Karachi which was 
set up in co-operation with Canada. However, Canada had stopped 
supplying fuel for this plant (KANUPP) in the 70s after which 
Pakistan s experts developed a local fuel for this project.
    
Yet another plant is being established at Chashma with China s co-
operation. The 300-mw plant (CHASHNUPP) is expected to become 
operational by the end of 1998.

According to sources the Khushab plant will also produce isotopes and 
enable Pakistan to export them. At present, the country has to import 
isotopes to meet requirements in various fields.

Pakistan, it may be pointed out, had prepared a 20-year plan for 
production of nuclear energy within the country. However, it could not 
be adhered to because of international pressures and other hindrances.
    
Had the plan been followed, Pakistan would have attained capability to 
make one reactor after every few years after the year 2000.

<A NAME="hanl">Hanley hints at evidence against Altaf</A>

Anjum Niaz

ISLAMABAD, Mar 4: The British minister of state in the foreign office, 
Jeremy Hanley, described his meeting here with Foreign Minister Sardar 
Assef Ahmed Ali as  very useful  and said he was now looking forward 
to meeting the leader of the opposition, Mian Nawaz Sharif.

Talking to Dawn at a reception by the British High Commissioner, Sir 
Christopher MacRae, Mr Hanley said:  I did not meet any MQM leaders 
while in Karachi, nor had I any plans to meet them. It is our policy 
only to meet those in the opposition who follow democratic ways and 
not adopt terrorism. 
    
Dilating on Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar s request for the 
expulsion of Altaf Hussain, Mr Hanley told this correspondent:
    
 Mr Altaf Hussain came to London legally. However, we have now 
received fresh evidence from General Babar about his involvement in 
encouraging terrorism and have passed on the material to our legal 
experts who are presently examining its validity. Should we receive 
incriminating evidence from our legal experts about Mr Hussain s 
involvement, we will expel him.

<A NAME="talk">Talks with MQM to resume, says Khan</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 5: The federal government has decided to resume 
dialogue with the MQM for a lasting peace in Karachi.  I have just 
established fresh contacts with Ajmal Dehlavi who has expressed his 
willingness to resume our 9th round of talks at the end of this 
month,  the minister for law and parliamentary affairs,  N.D.Khan 
said.

Mr Khan said the need for talks was felt specially when there was a 
lot of improvement in the law and order situation.  This is our yet 
another initiative to hold dialogue despite the fact that today there 
is a great measure of stability and peace in Karachi compared to June, 
July and August when there was a lot of killing , he said.

Responding to a question, Mr Khan remarked:  Let the 9th round of 
talks be held which might lead to an early local bodies election in 
Karachi.  He pointed out that the budget of Karachi Metropolitan 
Corporation was bigger than that of the budget of Balochistan which 
demanded that the political elements should activate themselves and 
prepare for local bodies polls.

<A NAME="mpas">MPAs being forced to abandon party: Altaf</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Our Correspondent

LONDON, March 5: Mohajir Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussain said that 
he was horrified at the latest  illegal  attempt made by the 
government to change the loyalties of three Sindh Assembly members 
belonging to his party.

He also expressed concern over the transfer to Islamabad of two of 
MQM s Karachi office bearers who were recently arrested.

He said this was all part of an official plan to use torture and force 
in order to make them denounce the MQM and join a rival party that the 
government was trying to create.

MPAs Mohammad Haroon Siddiqi, Dr Sagheer Ansari and S.M. Mohiuddin 
submitted an application to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, in which 
they have stated how they were taken from the prison by force.

They were later sent back but had a visit from Shamim Ahmad, the Sindh 
health minister, who allegedly asked them to change their loyalties if 
they wanted to save themselves from further torture and humiliation.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 4: Two young MQM men were killed and two others wounded 
in what the police described as an encounter with law enforcement 
agencies in Nasir Colony, Korangi.
 
The police claimed that on a complaint by a motorcyclist, Nasir Ahmed 
Beg, who was robbed of his motorcycle, mobiles of Korangi and Zaman 
Town police stations were rushed to Sector 32 A of Korangi where five 
or six armed men were seen extorting money from motorists.
    
When the police tried to surround them, the youths, they alleged, 
opened fire at them. Police which were later joined by rangers fired 
back in self-defence.
    
The victims, police claimed, were members of Nadeem Chitta gang of the 
MQM.

<A NAME="hrcp">HRCP report : Human rights ministry lacks mandate clarity</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 5: Recording its reservations about the viability of 
the newly-created Human Rights ministry, the Human Rights Commission 
of Pakistan (HRCP) has urged the Government to ratify at least the 
basic international instruments and to provide for their enforcement 
through the normal judicial system.

 The mandate of the Human Rights Ministry lacks clarity and its 
effectiveness will be restricted by lack of ratification of 
international human rights standards,  it has remarked in its  State 
of Human Rights in 1995  report.
    
Established last October, the Ministry is still without a Minister, it 
has observed.

 The system of justice came under various forms of pressure in 1995,  
the report has concluded in the light of its review of the state of 
 Administration of Justice . Its verdict about special courts is, 
particularly, significant and upholds the criticism by intellectual 
and civic rights experts.  The arguments advanced to justify special 
criminal tribunals have not stood the test of time , it has stated and 
called for a re-examination of the system of putting patches on the 
normal courts especially with a view to ensuring respect for the right 
to equality before law.

 HRCP made a study of the working of the Special Courts for 
Suppression of Terrorist Activities No. 1, Hyderabad, during 1995 as a 
sample. After institution of 245 fresh cases in 1995, the number of 
cases awaiting its decision rose to 466. Only 79 cases were  disposed 
of  by the end of the year.

According to further analysis by HRCP, out of the 79 cases considered 
disposed of, hearing concluded with the announcement of judgement in 
58 cases. As regards 21 other cases, 11 were transferred from the 
court, 6 kept dormant, proceedings in 3 were quashed, while one case 
was adjourned sine die. The court, HRCP concludes inter alia, 
maintained a high conviction rate, the ratio between conviction and 
acquittal being approximately 6:1.

The situation pertaining to higher judiciary denoted only 
deterioration, as indicated by:

* large number of vacancies at all levels.

* Throughout 1995 the mode of appointment of judges of superior courts 
remained an issue in public debate, especially at lawyers  forum.

* The practice of appointing High Court chiefs as acting governors 
continued except for Punjab, where the Assembly Speaker was chosen to 
act as governor during the regular incumbent s absence.
    
* The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was 
reportedly brought under pressure, following his expressed ire over 
the appointment of judges without his concurrence.

* In August, Justice Qurban Sadiq, president of a special court for 
offences against banks in Lahore, was summarily told that the court 
had been shifted to Rawalpindi with immediate effect and that he 
should go on leave for the remaining period of his tenure (78 days).
 
* There was an increase in incidents of violence on/around court 
premises, especially those caused by religious militants and 
supporters of political figures in custody or facing civil/criminal 
proceedings. During one appearance in court of Mr Nawaz Sharif, his 
counsel spurned the judge s request to quieten down the 
demonstrations.

* In March a contingent of Rangers surrounded the city courts in 
Karachi and searched the court rooms. Sixty persons were taken into 
custody.

HRCP has also taken grave notice of the attacks on lawyers and even a 
murder attempt on HRCP chairperson Asma Jehangir.

<A NAME="urge">HRCP urges probe for each custodial death</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 2: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, noting 
that several hundred persons in Karachi and around 180 in Punjab were 
killed in so called encounters last year, has urged the government to 
get each case of death in encounter or custody scrutinised by a 
judicial tribunal, and appoint an ombudsman to deal exclusively with 
grievances against police excesses.

The Commission in its report  State of Human Rights in 1995 , remarked 
that the government must develop a proper sensitivity to the issue of 
extra-judicial killings and display the requisite will to ensure that 
the law-enforcing agencies duly respect the rights of all people, 
especially the right to life and the right to equal protection under 
the law.

Lack of improvement in the legal redress mechanism or in the process 
of accountability further alienated the public, the report added.

 Even more disturbing,  it adds,  were signs of public conversion to 
the idea of instant, and brutal, retribution for persons suspected of 
heinous crimes. For instance, the rape and murder of a six-year old 
girl in Raiwind, near Lahore, sparked a public agitation for the 
lynching of the two boys believed to be guilty of the outrage, which 
did not subside even when the suspects had been shot down by the 
police, albeit in quite doubtful circumstances.

What is more, the present government s specific instructions embodied 
in a recent amendment to Section 167 of the CrPC against detention of 
women at night, has been obeyed only in its contravention by the law 
enforcing agencies.

It concedes that in clashes with armed criminals, 204 personnel of the 
law-enforcing agencies were also killed in Karachi, while the toll in 
Punjab was 80 police personnel dead. Nevertheless, the Commission has 
identified three factors that raise serious doubts about official 
versions: 

(i) Allegations by victims  families, etc., that the victims had been 
arrested alive and the notoriety gained by the police for not promptly 
recording arrests. 

(ii) Most post-arrest encounters are explained away with two stock 
stories   either the encounter is said to have taken place after a 
detainee s escape attempt or the police party escorting a detainee to 
a recovery site is said to come under attack from his associates or 
enemies and the detainee gets killed.

(iii) The authorities remain as stubbornly opposed to the idea of 
mandatory judicial probe as ever.

In view of growing public concern over killings in encounters and 
deaths in custody, and the fact that LHC called upon the police to 
submit detailed reports, the HRCP s Task Force in Hyderabad monitored 
62 deaths in Sindh (excluding Karachi) that invited suspicion. 

   They fell in six broad categories:
1. Death in police custody after allegations of torture. 
2. Death after release or transfer to hospital but torture suspected 
as the cause. 
3. Death in a so-called police encounter.
4. Death in prison as a result of torture. 
5. Death in prison owing to lack of proper medical care; and 
6. Deaths due to miscellaneous causes, including disposal after 
killing.

The report also includes 15 instances of abuse of authority by law-
enforcement agencies which took the form of illegal detention 
(including that of women), detention at unauthorised places, 
fabrication of cases, implication of innocent persons in blind FIRs, 
evasion of obligation to produce detainees in courts by transferring 
them from one police station to another, detention of relatives of 
wanted persons, and refusal to disclose arrest.

 A great many cases remained unreported as more and more people 
preferred to secure redress by paying illegal gratification or through 
the intervention of influential patrons to approaching courts or 
superior authorities, that were the principal sources of information 
to the public,  the report has observed.

HRCP, in its report has urged the Government of Pakistan to: 

* ratify the UN Convention on Torture and take effective steps to 
ensure its enforcement; 

* declare as cognizable offences illegal detention, arrest of 
relations of suspects, and use of unauthorised premises as detention 
centres; 

* amend the Police Act and the rules thereunder so as to conform to 
modern concepts of humane policing and prosecution; and 

* make the prosecution agencies independent of police.

Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, March 5: The government has agreed to order a judicial 
inquiry into the charges levelled by the MQM that its workers are 
being eliminated through extra-judicial killings.

Informed sources told Dawn that the government had decided to conduct 
a high-level judicial inquiry into the MQM s complaints. The MQM 
leadership has been alleging that its workers were being killed in 
police custody. Senator Aftab Sheikh alleged the other day that more 
than 200 MQM workers had been murdered in that manner.

The sources said an assurance had particularly been extended to the 
visiting British minister of state in the foreign office, Jeremy 
Hanley, that the government would soon set up a judicial commission to 
look into the allegations.  We are ready to hold a thorough 
investigation,  a ministerial source told this correspondent.  Yes, we 
may soon set up a high-level judicial commission to deal with the

<A NAME="reco">HRCP recommends abolition of Exit Control List</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 3: The number of persons placed on the Exit Control 
List (ECL) had grown to 1,250 by August last, while 400 persons, 
including 15 former federal ministers, were barred from travelling 
abroad early in 1995.

This has been stated in the  State of Human Rights in 1995  report of 
the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan which recommended abolition of 
the ECL and stressed that the executive should have no power to 
restrain travel.

 Any such restraint should be issued from or, at least, endorsed by 
the judiciary. And the affected person should have clear notice of it 
instead of being surprised at the airport,  the report observed.

It has made a strong plea for the adoption of a law that guarantees 
freedom of information except in clearly defined areas of national 
security and commercial confidentiality, or where disclosure may help 
commission of crime or may help identify the source of an official 
decision.  All current laws barring that freedom should be repealed. </pre><hr><pre>

<A NAME="sind">Sindh cabinet plan 3 industrial zones, police jobs for city youth</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Azizullah Sharif

KARACHI, March 6: The Sindh government in an attempt to help solve the 
unemployment problem of the Karachi youths will set up three zones for 
cottage industries, besides providing 5,000 jobs in the Police 
Department. This was decided at a special meeting of the Sindh 
cabinet.
    
Briefing newsmen about the cabinet decision, the Sindh Minister for 
Planning and Development, Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, said the cottage 
industries zones would be set up at Orangi, Baldia and Landhi.
    
The KMC, Mr Khuhro said, had been asked to develop 12,000 plots at the 
cottage industries zones. Besides, he added, the private sector would 
be involved in providing loan facilities to those unemployed educated 
youths who would be offered the industrial plots.
 
POLICE: Moreover, 5,000 jobs   from constable to officer   would be 
offered to the youths of all the four districts of the city, he added.
    
The meeting also decided to provide two jobs each to the families 
whose members had died in the acts of terrorism. Jobs to such people 
would be provided in the private sector for which the Karachi Chamber 
of Commerce and Industry had already offered its full assistance, he 
further said.

<A NAME="ramp">Rampant corruption : Break-up planned to save WAPDA</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, March 2: WAPDA is slated to undergo a phased break-up into 
small, economic pieces of activities before the authority breaks down 
under the weight of massive corruption and huge wastage it has been 
suffering from for decades, an informed source disclosed.

The government is already engaged in the exercise of designing a plan, 
under a World Bank directive, to separate water resource management 
from the authority s power related functions.

To start with, the distribution of irrigation water will come under 
the exclusive supervision of the provincial governments, with the dams 
going to a corps of engineers made up of engineers from the armed 
forces and the civil services.

The corps of engineers will also be responsible for constructing new 
dams and generating hydel power while a separate government utility 
agency will acquire all the power that is being generated in the 
country by private and public power stations.

But the transmission, distribution and billing activities will be 
completely privatised on the basis of area boards.

Hide-bound officials, led by a bloated WAPDA bureaucracy which has 
huge financial stakes in the matter are said to be resisting the 
break-up of the authority tooth and nail.

But those in the government who support the idea of dismantling WAPDA 
said that the argument which was used for the sale of UBL at a 
relatively low price, also applied to WAPDAs  break-up and its 
eventual privatisation as according to them if the authority is 
allowed to exist in its present form for one more year, not only will 
it cave in under its own weight, but will take down along with it the 
national economy also.

<A NAME="valu">Value-added sales tax on 12 items in next budget</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, March 4: The government has decided to impose the 
controversial value-added sales tax upto retail stage in the next 
budget on cloth, ready-made garments, hosiery, knitwear, jewellery, 
arms and ammunition, motor vehicles, motorised two and three wheelers, 
air-conditioners, deep freezers and refrigerators.
    
It has also been decided to withdraw sales tax exemption from the rest 
of the items (about 300) from the next budget. This will bring the 
total number of items under the sales tax net to about 525. 
Unprocessed food, medicines, pesticides and fertilisers would, 
however, remain exempted.
    
In addition to the above, the government has also decided to withdraw 
all fixed tax schemes in June, 1996 in accordance with the IMF 
agreement.
    
The government understands that the sales tax now being charged on 
these 12 items at the import and manufacturing levels and which are 
now being passed on to the final consumers in any case would be 
reimbursed in the amount they had paid to the importers and the 
manufacturers under the new system, while the final consumer would not 
have to pay anything more than what he is already paying for these 
items now which also includes the government s share of sales tax.
    
The government has taken this rather politically unpalatable decision 
because under the IMF Stand-by agreement of December 1995, an 
understanding has to be reached before the next budget with the Fund 
about the time and modalities of extension of sales tax to retail 
stage.

<A NAME="borr">Borrowing gap to be narrowed by Rs24bn</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 29 : The ministry of finance hopes to recoup, before 
March is over, nearly Rs 24 billion of the Rs 57.2 billion it has so 
far borrowed from the banks for budgetary purposes, to meet the IMF 
imposed end-March bank borrowing target of Rs 32 billion.
    
In a note on the subject which will come up for scrutiny by the 
government this week, the ministry of finance has explained that the 
main expenditure of Rs 3.7 billion provided to WAPDA as bridge 
financing and Rs 5.5 billion for purchase of food and fertiliser are 
reversible and will be recouped.
    
The provinces as well as the ministry of railways, on the other hand , 
are said to have been asked by the ministry of finance to make up 
quickly their cash balance deficits of Rs 2.4 billion and Rs 2.3 
billion respectively.
    
The ministry of finance further said that efforts were being made to 
effect recovery from the PTC and WAPDA, the main defaulters which had 
caused a shortfall of Rs 12 billion in non-tax receipts against the 
proportionate budget for end- January 1996.
    
A shortfall of Rs 9.5 billion has also taken place in non- bank 
borrowing against proportionate budget as the prize bonds of Rs 25,000 
and Rs 10,000 launched in December, 1995, could not fetch the budgeted 
resources.
    
In order to make up this loss, the ministry of finance has revised 
upward the rates of saving schemes and has also made arrangements for 
the sale of prize bonds from the National Bank of Pakistan branches 
also.
    
The ministry further explains that the bank borrowing as on January 
31, 1996, was Rs 50.5 billion. However, on February 1, 1996, there was 
a net cash outflow of Rs 6.7 billion, pushing up the total bank 
borrowing to Rs 57.2 billion.
    
As a result, domestic credit expansion at 15.11 per cent on February 
1, 1996, exceeded the target of 14. 27 per cent for the whole year and 
3.86 per cent in the corresponding period last year.
    
However, depletion of foreign exchange reserves of the country, far in 
excess of the credit plan assumptions, has so far kept monetary 
expansion within the credit plan target.
    
Money supply increased by 7.17 per cent up to February 1, 1996, as 
compared with the target of 12.1 per cent of 1995-96 as a whole and 
expansion of 8.22 per cent in the corresponding period last year.
    
Government borrowing for budgetary purposes increased from Rs 35 
billion at the end of December 1995 to Rs 57.2 billion as on February 
1, 1996.
    
At this level, government borrowing for budgetary support compared 
very unfavourably with the expansion of Rs 29.7 billion in the 
corresponding period last year and the target of Rs 32 billion for the 
end of March 1996.
    
The retirement of credit of commodity operations up to February 1, 
1996, is also much lower than in the corresponding period last year, 
which implies that with the beginning of the procurement season for 
wheat, government borrowing for commodity operations could also exceed 
the limit stipulated in the Credit Plan.
    
Expansion of the private sector credit up to February 1, 1996, is 
within the Credit Plan target for the year as a whole. Private sector 
credit(including PSE) up to February 1, 1996, expanded by Rs 52. 3 
billion as against the expansion of Rs 41.6 billion in the 
corresponding period last year and Rs 64 billion for 1995-96.

<A NAME="poli">Politicians, bankers responsible for low loan-recovery </A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Feb. 29: Growing political interference and mounting 
pressures in the banking along with imprudent and loosely supervised 
lending by the bankers have been identified as main factors 
responsible for dismally low recovery rate of agricultural loans, says 
an official report.
    
The report has been prepared by a sub-committee of the government s 
Agricultural Credit Advisory Committee and headed by the Chairman of 
the Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (ADBP).
    
The summary of the report says that during the last five years (from 
fiscal year 1990/1991 to fiscal year 1994/95) the annual recovery rate 
of agricultural credit in the commercial banks and ADBP ranged around 
60 per cent. It says that the 40 per cent rate of loan defaults is 
sharply impeding the liquidity position and financial viability of the 
banks.
    
The committee terms the rate of default as very alarming that calls 
for immediate remedial measures and identifies three sets of reasons 
for the same namely socio-economic, administrative and legal 
constraints.
    
 Socio-economic constraints identified includes attitude of borrowers 
towards non-repayment, diversion of funds, lack of managerial and 
technical skills of borrowers, diminishing returns on produce, lack of 
social restraints on prominent defaulters and unforeseen circumstances 
due to calamities etc. 

The committee identifies inadequacy of Tribunals/Special Courts, 
issuance of stay orders, rescheduling of loans and lengthy process and 
undue delay in decision of suits as main legal restraints that impede 
recovery of agricultural loans. Some other legal constraints as 
identified by the committee are inability of courts to enforce legal 
provisions, discretion in the grant of liquidated damages and 
inordinate delay in the execution of decrees.
    
The committee recommends that wilful default be made non-bailable 
offence and defaulters of Rs 1.0 million and above be disallowed from 
leaving the country. It further recommends that the list of defaulters 
be published in the press and they should be restricted from 
contesting elections to any tier (i.e. that of National 
Assembly/Senate, provincial assemblies or local bodies).
 
The committee recommends that crop insurance be introduced to the 
extent of loan amount and the recovery of loans be entrusted to 
private sector as an experiment. It suggests that rescheduling or 
write-off of loans in calamity-hit areas be compensated by the 
government; in the case of rescheduling it should be to the extent of 
the mark-up for the period involved.
    
The committee recommends to the financial institutions that officials 
responsible for unsound, fake and fraudulent lending should be 
severely punished, debarred from promotion and declared ineligible for 
holding assignments connected with provision of credit. It also 
recommends that rescheduling of loans may be allowed only in the real 
hardship cases and that too with an initial deposit of 20 per cent. It 
further recommends that the land of defaulters be auctioned to the 
banks.

<A NAME="stoc">Stock prices again fall across-the-board</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, March 6: Stock prices again fell across the board as follow 
through support turned shy in the absence of strong institutional and 
foreign buying.
    
The trading in part was also dominated by a World Cup match between 
Pakistan and New Zealand owing to early betting on the outcome of the 
match. It was, however, a comfortable win for Pakistan and as a result 
there were more winners than the losers in the early  satta .
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices, therefore, failed to 
sustained the overnight gains and was marked down by over 15 points at 
1,712.95 as compared to 1,727.98 a day earlier, reflecting the 
weakness of the base shares.
    
Although minus signs dominated the list, broader market performed well 
as some of leading shares managed to put on fresh good gains under the 
lead of Spencer Pakistan, which posted a fresh good gain of Rs 9 on 
heavy buying on market talks of its bid for Parke-Davis.
    
Engro Chemicals, which has been under pressure followed it finishing 
with a good gain of Rs 3, and so did first four ICP mutual funds, 
rising by Rs 2 to 10. Other ICPs, which rose were led by the 9th and 
the 12th.
    
Other good gainers included Atlas Lease, Apex Lease, Premier 
Insurance, Noon Sugar, PEL Appliances, Philips, Pak-Suzuki Motors, 
Reckitt and Colman, and Nestle Milkpak, rising by one rupee to Rs 
1.75.
    
Big losers were led leading shares such as PSO and Shell Pakistan, 
which suffered fall of Rs 6 each followed by Al-Ghazi Tractors, Zeal-
Pak Cement and Essa Cement, which suffered decline ranging from Rs 2 
to 2.75.
    
Barring a sharp decline of Rs 1.75 in Al-Noor Modaraba, fall in 
modarabas were mostly fractional and reflected lack of support rather 
large selling.
 
Bank shares also fell under the lead of Bank Al-Habib and Islamic Bank 
and so did insurance shares under the lead Adamjee Insurance.
    
Some of the MNCs, which finished with an extended decline, Atlas 
Honda, BOC Pakistan, Ciba-Geigy, Dawood Hercules, Fauji Fertiliser and 
Bata Pakistan were leading but the fall was modest.
    
Trading volume fell to 29.043 m shares from the previous 36.228m 
shares as leading dealers kept to the sidelines watching match.
    
There were 354 actives, out of which 190 shares suffered fall, while 
89 gained, with 75 holding on to the last levels.
    
Dividend news from Quetta Textiles and Bhanero Textiles at the rate of 
10 and 17.5 per cent were encouraging but they failed to lift textiles 
shares up from the current lower levels as investors were not inclined 
to take risks.

<A NAME="nity">Nityanandashivaramakrishna</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

WHEN my pikeman announces the arrival of Netaji, I realise it is my 
friend Nityanandashivaramakrishna, born in Ernakulam, in what was 
Travancore and now is Kerala. Why, in the name of heaven, I ask, did 
your family have to give you an unpronounceable unspellable name? 
Arrey bhai! he retorts, what s so unpronounceable about a mere five 
syllable word? It is very simply spelled: yen-aayie-tee-wyee-yeh-yen-
yeh-yen-dee-yeh- yuss-yuch-aayie-wee-yeh-aar-yeh-yum-yeh-kay-aar-
aayie-yuss-yuch- yen-yeh.
    
Netaji grew up having raa yeggus for breakfast, speaking Malayalam (a 
palindrome), he moved on to Mumbai, became a sports writer, covered 
the unofficial test matches in 1945, when our Abdul Hafiz Kardar 
played for India under Vijay, along with Mushtaq, CS, Russi Modi, 
Amarnath, Gul Mohammed, Hindlaker and others. He indulged in 
journalism, writing for Current, edited by Dossu Karaka (the first 
brown president of the Oxford Union) and Blitz edited by Russi 
Karanjia. He now resides under the sun on the Iberian peninsula.
    
Recently on a visit to Delhi, he stopped in Karachi on his way back 
and gave me a copy of the February 19 The Times of India (Rs. 1.50 as 
opposed to Rs. 10 for this newspaper) which carried an editorial of 
great interest, a comment on the thoughtful oratory of Chief Justice 
Aziz Ahmadi of the Indian Supreme Court at the Zakir Hussain Memorial 
Lecture held earlier this month. Pakistan-friendly Netaji shares my 
strong addiction for disestablishmentarianism. We have lots of fun, 
laughing at ourselves, talking to each other in fluent Gujurdish. On 
his last visit, we discussed what Delhi thought of us and we of them. 
Delhi apparently reads and knows more about us than we about them.
    
Cricket: What spurred the Indians to clothe the winning attributes of 
the beautiful woman who won laurels for her country, was crowned  Miss 
Universe  and, who rose to be the centre of attraction at the opening 
of the World Cup at Calcutta? Stupidity, we both agreed. We talked 
about the disgraceful manner in which our government has chosen to 
ignore our 1992 World Cup winning captain, Imran Khan. Imran would be 
well within his rights to sprint round the ground, and then watch the 
finals sitting amongst the  char-anna-wallas . The real cricket world 
would gladly sit at his feet, and acclaim the honour he did us.
    
On the Press: In India it is far more free, in the true sense of the 
word, than it is here. The government does not worry about what is 
written, it does not try to bribe, coerce or buy editors and 
journalists. Newspapers are printed in every conceivable language of 
the country and the circulation of The Times of India is close to 0.5 
million. Why can we not buy an Indian newspaper here? The import of 
Indian newspapers and magazines and journals is banned by our 
government. Why? Nobody has a logical answer. The ban was imposed 
during the 1965 war, thereafter paranoia prevailed and it was never 
lifted. We can import the Haitian Herald, the Vanuatu Viewpoint, but 
not an Indian paper. The import of  non-controversial  Indian books is 
permitted. So what s controversial? Naturally the Bomb, Kashmir, War, 
Defence of the realm, the proficiency of the armed forces, and such 
like subjects of interest.
    
Corruption: Pervades on both sides. Over there, they have a sense of 
shame, they try to sweep corruption under the carpet. Politicians 
exposed by the Press resign. Here, it is flaunted, institutionalised. 
We have far too many Ali Babas. The Indian bureaucracy is not 
encouraged to be corrupt, spouses of bureaucrats are not employed as 
advisers, consultants, chairpersons of committees, bottlewashers, and 
so forth.
    
Economy: India boasts of Manmohan Singh, a universally respected 
honest finance minister. The Indians laugh at the  transparency  of 
our government s transactions and know all about the multi-million 
dollar deals and policies, considered and approved by our apex 
committee, the ECNEC, such matters not having been listed on the 
agenda but being hurriedly discussed under the head of  any other 
item.  Over there they don t believe in  MOU culture , they count 
their chickens after they are hatched. Delhi is aware of how all 
decisions are taken in our prime minister s house and in her 
secretariat, how they are then rubber-stamped in the President s House 
or the concerned ministries. They know how our civil servants are  O-
esdeed  should they question or protest. India s size, its market, its 
sheer preponderance in the region, lends it more credibility. The 
figures that Manmohan Singh spews out are better believed.
    
Hegemony: Of course, India does have hegemonic designs. It would like 
its empire to extend itself beyond the borders of that of Chandra 
Gupta s Mauryan Empire. But it is not interested, for the time being, 
in subjugating what is left of Pakistan and thus giving itself more 
problems than it already has. What it does want is a weak buffer state 
on its western front. India does not want to be too close to Iran, or 
within range of the gun and heroin culture of Afghanistan. The men in 
Delhi are well aware how the Americans have struck a deal with our 
drug baron Afridi, how he and his tapes (on which are recorded 
conversations he has had with our  high-ups ) are being kept in the US 
in a safe-house to be produced when the time is ripe. India wants a 
weak and destabilised Pakistan and they do not have to do much to 
achieve that aim. In this, we are their greatest ally.
    
Kashmir: India is obdurate. Like us, it is blind to the third option. 
Each time our poor old FM Sardar makes a sensible statement, he rushes 
in to deny it and complains that the Press has misreported his words. 
The Kashmiris are suffering and being annihilated through no fault of 
theirs. Left to themselves they would vote in an independent state and 
make it viable. Independence can be sustained by its people, their 
craft, natural resources, and tourism. It is ideally situated to be 
the private banking centre of the region. Swiss bankers and Wall 
Street Jews can be called in to lay the infrastructure.
    
The judiciary: Back to Justice Ahmadi, the subject of the Times of 
India editorial. He drew attention to the destruction of democratic 
institutions through the corruption and criminalisation of politics 
and berated the inertia of the Indian constitutional functionaries and 
their lack of response to the threats to his country s democratic 
institutions and to the citizen s need to secure justice. The citizen, 
he said,  cannot be expected to wait for the system to correct itself; 
he will and can be expected to take upon himself the task of enforcing 
the rights granted to him by the Constitution. 
    
Justice Ahmadi observed that  in recent times we have noticed 
instances of one wing of the government avoiding to take a decision on 
a politically sensitive issue by passing it to another wing, the 
latter not being expected to make that decision... In cases where the 
sensitive issue is not pushed into the lap of another institution; we 
have noticed that it remains unattended and unresolved making the 
people restive and forcing them to take it to the courts. 
    
The Indian judiciary, he stated, does not seek an expanding role, but 
it has had to  extend its jurisdiction by, at times, issuing novel 
directions to the Executive, something it would never have resorted to 
had the other two democratic institutions functioned in an effective 
manner.  Judicial activism thus assumes a democratic purpose. But, 
stressed the Chief Justice, this activism, in its aggressive role, 
when the judiciary has been forced to pronounce a judgement on 
politico-legal and socio-economic issues, will have to be a temporary 
one, a corrective phenomenon only.
    
The legislature, the executive, the judiciary and the media   the four 
estates   have their mutually enforcing roles in any democracy and 
none can usurp the role of the other. The upper judiciary is not 
adequately equipped to take on the job of cleansing the republic, that 
is, cleansing the two rotten estates, the legislature and the 
executive. It would be simplistic to blame just these two, the rot in 
the system is more widespread. The judiciary must look into the 
mirror, rather than just hold it before others. And the media must 
turn the spotlight on itself, even as it places other institutions 
under a microscope.
    
Thus spake the Muslim Chief Justice of predominantly Hindu secular 
India (a cricketer to boot   he along with my counsel and our former 
Attorney-General, Aziz Munshi, played for the famous Gujrat College of 
Ahmedabad).
    
Nityanandashivaramakrishna has flown away to bask under the Spanish 
sun and write his new book  50-year-old Mother India  which he hopes 
to have published by August 1997.

The result is, yes, they are: if you mobilise all your resources to 
focus on a single venue, control transport to and from it, and check 
all entrants. Why should there have been trouble at the Karachi 
Stadium? Karachi s law enforcement agencies are always at the nets. 
They are in superb training, policing and patrolling specific points. 
So what if there was something poignant about the crowd s 
determination to have a good time. Despite the lunch-box restrictions 
and the  don t wear your heart on your sleeve  admonition, they were 
allowed to congregate and watch cricket.
    
And then, having pulled it off the first time, the authorities had to 
gloat. As he rather tends to, General Babar intruded. He presented 
Miandad with a cheque for six lakhs.
    
The whole thing was offensive. What a way to put paid to a glorious 
cricketing career, inspired by a love of the game and a pride in 
playing for the country. If everything can be reduced to rupees and 
paisa, six lakhs might buy the bumper and front fender of the kind of 
Mercedes Miandad was so memorably gifted by an Arab fan in his heyday.
    
But it was in a way a moment of truth about the way people feel.
    
Miandad was the crowd s darling that day, exuberantly cheered each 
time he moved.  I ve never seen a single four greeted like that  was 
one Starsports TV commentator s remark. And the chant of  Miandad 
Miandad  was not just because people had been watching Bodyline on 
Starplus and heard the chorus of  Bradman Bradman.  Miandad is the 
Karachi boy who played cricket on the streets and became an 
international star. He is very much a symbol of pride for the Mohajir 
identity. That is why there has sometimes been a certain paranoia 
about Miandad getting less than his due at the hands of selectors. 
That is also a little why there was so much speculation about his not 
getting to play in last Thursday s match.
    
The frenetic acclaim for him on the field was also an audio equivalent 
of waving a certain tricolour. When General Babar was selected to 
present Miandad with an award it rather seemed more about scoring 
political points than cricketing ones.
    
In its zeal to win the battle with the MQM, the law enforcement outfit 
can stumble. It is a little ungracious for the General to indicate 
that Karachiites had shown sound patriotic feeling during the World 
Cup fixtures. Has even the MQM(A) specifically indicated it would like 
to see Pakistan defeated? What would it suggest to the Minister of the 
Interior s mind were India to beat Pakistan in a one-day match and 
Karachi took it in a sporting spirit? Or failed to behave as if we had 
rescued the Holy Grail were we to win instead? Is it required of all 
Karachiites or only those who are Mohajir, or only those who are 
MQM(A) voters to establish their bona fides as patriots?  That last is 
what many think General Babar s campaign has been too much about, and 
they also think it s not cricket in that it s not fair. One doesn t 
have to be rooting for the MQM(A) to see that: one just has to have a 
sporting spirit.
    
The authorities like to maintain that the MQM s record of conduct, its 
very inception and formation, its leader s heinous crimes put it 
beyond the pale. This may all be true. But the PPP will always come up 
against one objection: the MQM s record was exposed at the beginning 
of Operation Clean-up in mid- 92. Altaf Hussain had gone into self-
exile before that. Torture cells had been unearthed; first person 
narration s publicised. The pattern and style were all too well known. 
The documentation substantial. Why then did they, with every courtesy 
and no evident reservations, ask Altaf Hussain and his men for their 
votes in the Presidential election? And if they could do business with 
that kind of political party, why are the people who would like to 
vote for it suspect?
 
But this was meant to be all about cricket and the crowd and General 
Babar. To speak only for myself: What struck me in the snatch of the 
presentation ceremony to Miandad as televised by PTV was the quality 
of the crowd s reaction. It had been cheering with delight, applauding 
its hero, Miandad, at the slightest excuse, and, of course, thrilled 
by the Pakistan win. When General Babar took over, there was a ripple 
of bewilderment and then a subdued hush. The rest was silence.
    
But the cameras focused on the dais. And there was applause around 
there. Perhaps the sound engineers had just tuned out the background 
noise for us to hear the General better.

<A NAME="aque">A question of good manners</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Omar Kureishi

THE British once held dominion over palm and pine and it created a 
certain mind-set. Now that they no longer do, there is a need for them 
to come to terms with the changed circumstances.

The pukka sahib once used to be a figure of authority and he commanded 
obedience and no one dared make fun of him. In the present day, the 
pukka sahib would be a cartoonist s delight, a Terry Thomas character, 
a butt of jokes and an object of ridicule. No one in his right mind 
would want to behave like one though the mentality behind it sometimes 
surfaces, in the heat of the moment, as it were. What is bred in the 
bones comes out in the flesh. I do not think that Mike Atherton was 
trying to be a pukka sahib when he called a Pakistani journalist a 
buffoon in Rawalpindi though it sounded suspiciously like it. The 
natives used to be called worse than this. A buffoon, after all, is 
only a wag or a jester and normally is not a word one would use if one 
wanted to show annoyance.

I can think of any number of more robust Anglo-Saxon words that would 
have conveyed the same contempt. Buffoon is mild. Donald Carr s 
players claimed that they were playing the buffoon when they roughed 
up a Pakistani umpire in Peshawar in 1956. We were expected to 
understand that nothing more serious was intended. A bit of horse-
play.

I would give to Atherton the benefit of the doubt. There were 
extenuating circumstances. England had lost to South Africa, yet 
again, Atherton himself had made a duck and he was under great 
pressure. It would be reasonable to say that he was not in the best of 
humour and with good reason. It can be argued that a captain is 
expected to maintain his cool and in the case of an England captain to 
keep a stiff upper lip.

He has apologised through the team s management though the wording of 
the apology is a bit unconvincing, as if, it was extracted from him 
rather like the apology made by Mike Gatting in that infamous row he 
had with Shakoor Rana in Faisalabad. The apology was formal and lacked 
a personal touch, something to the effect that there was no intention 
to hurt anyone s feelings. But I think we should accept that it was a 
gaffe and hope that Atherton himself realises that it is boorish to 
call someone a buffoon even if you are an honoured guest in someone 
else s country. All cultures differ about how a guest is expected to 
behave. In our culture a guest can do no wrong   almost.

In the past, a team underwent the most routine kind of training before 
going on a tour. Now the emphasis is not only on physical fitness but 
also on mental conditioning. Thus not only are physios and doctors 
attached to a team but psychiatrists as well. I would recommend that 
teams be imparted lectures about the countries that they are touring, 
something about local customs, about history and culture. The idea is 
not to make them better educated but to make them better prepared to 
deal with their hosts. It would remove a great deal of 
misunderstanding and may even help the players and media in enjoying 
themselves.

I have travelled a great deal, all over the world and on each one of 
those visits I have learnt something new. This is because I have made 
a special effort to meet people, to ask a lot of questions and most of 
all not to be judgmental. When I first went to China in 1956, it was a 
totally new experience. I did not speak a word of the language, had no 
contact of any kind with the Chinese people. I could have been in 
Outer Space. Most of all I did not know a soul and there were no 
friends that I could fall back on if I got lonely.

But I made a special effort. I learnt that differences did not mean 
that something was either inferior or superior. They had their way of 
doing things and we had ours. My social and cultural values were at 
variance with theirs and I did not want to be like them as they did 
not want to be like me. As a consequence I enjoyed myself and came 
back with a much greater understanding of a great country.

This World Cup provides a wonderful opportunity for our visitors to 
see something of the subcontinent. The players and the media may be 
busy because the schedule is very tight and the travelling is 
something of a nightmare. But one can hear the sounds and see the 
sights. All one needs is an open mind and a temporary hold on one s 
preconceived notions and built-in prejudices. Our visitors will 
discover that we are a hospitable people and are glad that the 
visitors are in our country. The visitors will discover too that we 
have many shortcomings and those from developed countries will find 
that sometimes things do not work as well as they do in their 
countries.

But that is no reason to make a value-judgement. Only an ignorant man 
or woman will do that. For those visiting the subcontinent for the 
first time there may be a culture-shock but they must appreciate that 
when we visit their countries for the first time, we too encounter a 
culture-shock but we respond differently. We don t turn hostile. It is 
not often realised that not even two grains of sand are identical.

We expect that the tournament will be intensely and fiercely 
competitive. Each team will have its own supporters, the home teams 
more of them. There will be a great show of national jubilation and 
national disappointment, depending how the teams are faring. But we 
must understand that we are not waging war and what is at stake is the 
winning of the World Cup, a high honour and a matter of pride but no 
more than that. No matter who wins, the earth will continue to rotate 
on its axis and the sun will rise in the East and set in the West. In 
other words, life will go on.

What we expect from our guests is that they should not abuse our 
hospitality and they should respect our customs as we would theirs. We 
want, when this World Cup is over, that our guests have a better 
understanding of our country. The major responsibility is on the hosts 
but the guests must make the effort to appreciate that a lot of people 
are putting themselves out to be helpful. Good breeding demands that 
this be understood. It is said that those who travel and leave their 
hearts at home do not travel. It can also be said that those who 
travel and leave their good manners at home also do not travel. Like 
the American Express card, one should never leave home without them.</pre><hr><pre>

<A NAME="paki">Pakistan determined to bring glory</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
A. Majid Khan

The sub-continent is in the grip of World Cup fever and in Pakistan 
cricket experts seem to be enthusiastically busy in the build-up of 
the defending champions so that a new record of winning the mega 
event, never before won by a host nation in the Cup s 21-year history.
    
Everyone from the elite s to man in the street is concerned about the 
outcome of the Cup and looking forward with great hopes that the Wasim 
Akram-squad would not disappoint the nation.
    
Unprecedented cash awards have been announced by the official and 
unofficial agencies for Pakistan team to provide incentives enabling 
them to the prestigious Cup, won under the leadership of Imran Khan on 
the Melbourne ground, four years ago. At that time no lucrative cash 
prizes were announced before-hand and as such the greatest motivating 
factor was national spirit and honour. Pakistanis fought back from 
hopeless position to win the World Cup that stunned the cricket world.
    
Our players, under the captaincy of Test all-rounder Wasim Akram, are 
determined and disciplined to bring glory for the their countrymen. 
But it is a fact that the team is under considerable pressure as the 
nation hates defeat and adores only the champions. This is our 
national psyche though it runs counter to the true spirit of the game 
that demands fighting to the end irrespective of victory and defeat.
    
The challenge for Pakistan is formidable as other strong contenders 
for the cup are former champions Australia, and India besides South 
Africa. On paper Pakistan is a balanced side and its composition by 
and large is approved by experts and former test stars.
    
There is general consensus that the sub-continental strips, including 
those in Pakistan, are batsman s paradise. The pitches, in Pakistan 
India, Sri Lanka are virtually grassless. If at all they had been 
prepared to the advantage of spinners. The pacers would have to 
produce extra ordinary speed and accuracy for earning wicket forcing 
the batsmen to commit errors.
    
Slow wickets with low bounce are made to order for big scores as 
people watching one-day cricket love to see high scores interspersed 
with sixes and four. So the sixth World Cup appears to be a challenge 
for our pace bowlers Wasim Akram, Waqar Younus and Aaquib Javed who 
will have to work hard like other fast bowlers.
    
In such a situation Mushtaq Ahmed, the right arm leg spinner, would be 
carrying a heavy responsibility to fully exploit the conditions. He is 
a world class bowler in like the Australian Shane Warne and India s 
Anil Kumble. The other top teams, though have the spinners, but not of 
that calibre. The off-spinners might not be much effective on such 
wickets and new comes Saqlain Mushtaq most of the time watch the 
matches from the side line.
    
Asif Iqbal and Javed Miandad were among the top fielders of the early 
World Cups. Miandad is making a record sixth appearances in the 
contest but expecting him to produce the same brilliant fielding at 
the age of 39 seems to be an unfair demand more so after remaining out 
of cricket for nearly two years through knee injury. The overall 
fielding of Pakistan squad looks ordinary as compared to fielding 
skill shown by South Africa, Australia, Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka.

<A NAME="mian">Miandad finally comes out to bat</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Mar 3: He may have been jittery but anyone coming to play 
after an absence of nearly two years and that too before a packed 
crowd, would have felt the same as Miandad did against England.

During his unbeaten stay at the wicket he scored 11 runs but that 
short stint gave him a lot of confidence and broke the spell of long 
drought of staying out of competitive cricket.

It was truly then that he created history - having played in all the 
six world cups - in the match against UAE at Gujranwala it was more of 
a formality as he never came on to bat while he was not included in 
the team that lost to South Africa.

His arrival was a typical Miandad coming to the ground - dragging 
along his bat on the ground then having a look all around. But perhaps 
never before he was applauded in such a big way by the capacity crowd 
at his home ground.

Miandad s innings was characteristic of a batsman who remains out of 
touch with the bat for a long time. He was dropped once, opened his 
account nervously when a direct throw could have easily sent him back 
to the pavilion and tried to steer away the ball to the boundary but 
could not.

The emotional crowd, of course chanting for Pakistan s victory, gave 
him a thunderous applause when Javed scored his first run in 18 months 
in international cricket and that clearly showed on his face how happy 
he was.

The master batsman may not have played a decisive role in Pakistan s 
seven-wicket win over England but his gaining confident should inspire 
Pakistan to campaign for the title in champions mould.

Crowd of around 20,000 chanted  Miandad   Miandad  when his name was 
announced from the public address system that he was among the final 
eleven announced by Pakistan selection committee.

This was his last match in front of his home crowd from where 
he started his cricket from the streets of the city and rose to
the international fame and limelight.

The ace batsman started his career with a century on his Test debut 
against New Zealand in 1976-77 and ended the series in sensational 
manner by hitting a double century in the third test at National 
Stadium.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<A NAME="forp">For Pakistan purposeful rhythm is needed</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

WITH combinations for quarterfinals determined, the question for 
Pakistan is: can the team achieve integrated and purposeful rhythm and 
professional discipline by the time it meets India in Bangalore.

By now the players must have realised how far behind the other teams 
they are in at least two areas: fielding and comprehension of demands 
of instant cricket as it is being played in the sixth edition of the 
World Cup. Never unimportant, this awareness has become vital as the 
tournament enters the survive-or-perish stage.
    
Experiments against South Africa - playing two spinners instead of 
three pacemen and one spinner did not come off because the team lacked 
tactical know-how to exploit its resources. Mushtaq was brought on too 
early, without insight of batsman at the crease or a gameplan for 
field placing. On top of that, Saqlain Mushtaq, the success of the 
match, was sidelined in the next contest.
    
As a result today s tie with New Zealand is immaterial and irrelevant 
to standings, Pakistan can afford to use it to prepare for the next 
vital clash which would take the team to the next semis or show the 
exit door for the team.
    
Pakistan has been playing six batsmen. They are needed when top order 
is assigned the launching of a blitzkrieg for that involves the risk 
of losing early wickets. But if that is not the intention, packing 
batting becomes incomprehensible.
    
Sri Lanka has a specialist batsman at number seven as it goes for 
fireworks with the word go. Australia sets a hectic pace from the 
start because it has Ian Healy batting at five or six drop. South 
Africa went for explosions from the first delivery with an eye on the 
target; presumably it would stick to this design in the next match if 
it bats first, particularly after the India-Sri Lanka run bonanza. For 
India, Sachin Tendulkar makes an eruptive beginning even though the 
team s opening pair is undecided.
    
In contrast, Pakistan has been trekking the traditional path of 
cautious start, gradual build-up and go for broke in slog overs. In 
the new pattern of batting, it does not sound like prescriptions for a 
healthy total batting first and could put the team under siege in 
middle overs in a chase.
    
Rules of the game have changed. Would Pakistan make an effort to 
recognise this reality in today s match and adjust accordingly, 
arrange ballistics for blast at the first call if it is batting first 
and strike with a deafening bang if it is required to chase?
    
A shortcoming of the team is absence of a long distance runner. Aamir 
Sohail has boldness of approach and the strokes. A ton is however not 
on from him in every outing, more so as he is the team s official 
blaster, even though he has somewhat slowed down. Others, Saeed Anwar 
and Ejaz Ahmad tend to lose concentration when full throttled attack 
is required.
    
Salim Malik was calculated against South Africa but when it was time 
for putting the bowling to sword, he was found inadequate for acting 
as agent for demolition which has often been in the past.
    
Inzamam has the range and the stamina but would need reliable company 
for playing a long devastating innings. Javed Miandad confirmed at 
Karachi against England that his gusto was intact. But he would be 
needed more if repair work was required.
    
Ramiz Raja, the experienced quality war horse with breath for a 
demanding stretch and track performance to match has been assigned as 
stand in the stable. One would that he was first eleven member.
    
Bowling remains a valuable asset for the team but it could do with 
greater discipline. There is very little room for error in the win-or-
lose brand of cricket that one-dayers are.
    
The worst aspect of the team has been its failure to benefit from the 
presence of cricket s sage, master tactician Miandad. It could 
certainly do with more precise field placing and timely bowling 
changes to attack the batsmen s limitations.
    
The campaign for retaining the world champions  title looks a lost 
cause with instinctive handling of bowlers; you can play it by the ear 
once in a while but not as a matter of policy. Bowling remains a 
single barrel weapon in our age of automatics. It is to be fired after 
focusing the target. Intikhab Alam and Wasim Akram must involve 
Miandad who has given every indication of being available. Placing him 
next to the ropes is throwing away the pearl richer than the tribe.
    
The team would be immensely better off acknowledging that nobody knows 
cricket s ropes more intimately than Miandad. His is the cricketing 
brain the team desperately needed to guide the powerful brawn at its 
disposal.
    
Pakistan must decide its strategy today for the next match. Going to 
the battle with hope and faith is desirable but even the most talented 
group would find success elusive without backing aspirations with 
commitment and investing and harnessing all of its resources in a 
campaign like retaining the World Cup in the toughest of combat.

<A NAME="theg">The good, the bad and the ugly</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Tanvir Amad

How much difference does it make to the result of a match in any game 
when its captain leads his team from the front and sets an example for 
his team mates. This was more than convincingly demonstrated during 
the two World Cup matches played on Thursday. In both cases two of the 
highly-rated sides sank low because of poor and unimaginative 
leadership.
 
The West Indies, the only team to have won the World Cup twice and 
having featured in three of the five finals to-date, succumbed to a 
non-Test playing team because their skipper failed to motivate his 
team-mates.
 
 Richie Richardson is not doing well and seems to have allowed things 
to deteriorate,  former West Indian captain Vivian Richards, once upon 
a time Richie s guide and mentor, said in a scathing remark on the eve 
of the West Indies -Kenya tie. Although there are some who think that 
Richards  remarks just a day before the match went on to do more bad 
than good to the team. But then some one has to say the truth... to 
bring to a halt the deterioration.
 
At home, although Pakistan s defeat at the hands of the South Africans 
was not as embarrassing as in Pune, where the amateur Kenyans sent 
packing the mighty West Indians for 93,in just about 35 overs. But the 
end result in both cases is the same.

We here in Pakistan can draw the satisfaction that our team batted 
better. But that is all about it. When it came to keeping the 
opponents within the target of 243, considered by many as reasonable 
the bowlers made a mess of themselves, the skipper, Wasim Akram 
conceding 49 runs in 9 overs. That is what you call   leading from 
behind. 
 
I do not recall off hand but one newspaper in the West Indies is 
reported to have suggested:  When a company fails it is the head who 
is responsible and bears the brunt. If a team fails the captain s head 
should roll.  

Scores of columns have been written in newspapers all over the country 
on Pakistan s failure.

A match can be lost because of a number of factors. Defeat or success 
is the two sides of any game. But it hurts real bad when the champions 
play like novices and then try to wriggle out by dishing out flimsy 
excuses. 

That is what Akram did after the match.   I misread the wicket and 
decided to play two spinners. It is a mistake and anybody can make a 
mistake on a given day,  the Pakistan captain is reported to have 
said. 

One has it on authority that the decision to play Saqlain Mushtaq was 
made as early as on Tuesday. But there is nothing wrong in it. What 
was suicidal to drop the third seamer and go the match with four 
instead of five specialist bowlers, not against Holland or UAE but a 
team which has batting deep down to number 7. 

When the South Africans began the run chase, one could see very 
clearly that the Pakistan bowlers were under pressure, the field 
placings were in utter disregard to the requirement of the bowlers and 
the fielding itself amateurish. You do not drop two catches and miss a 
stumping chance against such a team and still hope to win -simply 
because you are the defending champions. On the contrary Hansie Cronje 
rose to great heights of leadership as well as his personal 
performance. And it was the second quality which immensely motivated 
his team to play an inspired game. The South Africans for all intents 
and purposes came to this match , treating it a trial run of the March 
17 final. There is no doubt that there was no matching of the wits 
between Hansie Cronje and Wasim Akram and that in the end made all the 
difference when the South Africans made their win look ridiculously 
easy. 

Their approach was professional with lots of home work. Pakistan s was 
based on the spur of the moment and instinct. Thursday s win have for 
sure done a world of good to the visitors while the Pakistanis would 
be rightly cheesed off. Everything went wrong for them that day and in 
the end injuries to Rashid Latif and Sohail compounded their agony.

<A NAME="thef">The fall of the high & mighty</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

WHEN Kenya beat the West Indies at Pune by 73 runs and caused a major 
upset of the present World Cup, it surely was not the first time that 
a non-Test-playing nation staged an upset in the World Cup games.

Neighbouring African country Zimbabwe also had the distinction of 
doing the same in their first World Cup in 1983 when they defeated a 
strong Australian outfit at Trent Bridge by a narrow margin of 13 
runs. Australia that year did not make the finals.

The 1992 World Cup had a shock in store for England when at Albury in 
Victoria, once again Zimbabwe were the team who stunned a major 
participant of the Cup. Zimbabwe had beaten them by nine runs. England 
however managed to recover to reach the final and then lose to 
Pakistan.

If not for that silly rain rule of the 1992 cup games, South Africa 
playing for the first time in the World Cup would also had caused a 
stir to reach the final. England were saved the humiliation because of 
rain.

The West Indians who were once bowled out for only 31 runs against 
Ireland in Ireland in the seventies may not achieve what England did 
in the 1992 competition. Their exit from the present World Cup is now 
most likely result for them even before reaching the final stages.

The first upset of the World Cup at Trent Bridge in Nottingham on June 
9, 1983 came in only the third match of the third World Cup. Kim 
Hughes s Australians had put Zimbabwe in who made the best use of a 
good batting pitch to score 239 for 6 in a 60-over match. Grant 
Paterson and Ali Omar Shah had provided a sound start of 55 for the 
first wicket in only 19 overs before falling at the same score to 
Dennis Lillee for 27 and 16. At lunch they had lost five wickets for 
95 with Graham Yallop and Allan Border taking the last three wickets.

Zimbabwe later recovered through a fine unbeaten innings of 69 by 
Duncan Fletcher who was assisted by useful innings of 27 by Kevin 
Curren and unbeaten 34 by Ian Butchart.

Chasing 240, Australian openers Graeme Wood and Kepler Wessels put on 
61 but Kim Hughes was caught by Shah off Fletcher without scoring. 
Australia were 77 for 2 at tea off 25 overs. South African, Andrew 
Traicos, playing for Zimbabwe and Andrew Pycroft picked up two very 
fine catches to dismiss David Hookes and Graham Yallop.

There were 18 overs still to be bowled and Australia required 93 more 
runs with six wickets in hand.

Sitting in the Press enclosure I could see panic-stricken Aussie faces 
and the Australian journalists had already started to talk of an 
upset. Wessels who had so far batted with a lot of resilience then was 
run out for 76 off a Jack Heron s throw which disturbed the timber. As 
the run rate required soared to ten an over in the last five, Border 
was out to Curran for 17. Rodney Marsh dropped earlier, however, 
managed an unbeaten 50 but it was all in vain as Zimbabwe had a 
sensational win for the first time in the Cup.

A chicken farmer from Zimbabwe, Eddo Brandes then plucked England s 
feathers in 1992 at Albury with 4 for 21 in ten overs. At Lavingston 
Sports Ground, England were embarrassed. Although they had already 
reached the semi-finals, the result must have been shattering.

England set to make 135 were bowled out for 125 in 49.1 overs. 
Zimbabwe who had not won any of the seven matches in the tournament 
were obviously delighted. David Houghton s 29 and Ian Butchart s 24 
were major contributions as Ian Botham and Richard Illingworth picked 
up 3 for 23 and 3 for 33 respectively.

With Graham Gooch out leg before on the first ball of the innings 
Botham caught for 18 off Shah and the batting further dented with the 
dismissals of Allan Lamb and Robin Smith, England were in dire 
straits. Alec Stewart and Neil Fairbrother put on a useful 52-run 
stand in 25 overs making 29 and 20. Wickets kept tumbling and when 
Gladstone Small was caught by Pycroft off Jarvis, Zimbabwe had done it 
again.

In the match against West Indies, the Kenyans Rajab Ali and Muarice 
Odumbe achieved what their African neighbours had achieved in 1983 and 
1992 World Cup, a major upset. Good on them and good luck to them. It 
surely will do a lot of good to the game in that part of the world. In 
the West Indies however, a defeat at the hands of the Kenyans will do 
a lot of harm to them, scattered as they on innumerable islands. Their 
pride has been dented and it will take some time for them to rise from 
the debris of a humiliating defeat by a country making its debut in 
the World Cup.

<A NAME="ther">The revolutionary pattern of Cup</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Christopher Martin-Jenkins

I do not like to think of myself as having reached the stage of a 
veteran. The painful truth, however, is that I have been privileged to 
watch, commentate and report upon each of the six World Cups. 21 years 
is a tiny span, really, but, my, how things have changed since Sunil 
Gavaskar appeared to be playing for a draw in the first-ever World Cup 
match at Lord s. Faced with an England total of 334   Dennis Amiss 
scored 137   that masterly little Indian settled for batting practice: 
he scored 36 not out in 60 overs off 174 balls. Anyone doing that now 
would be charged with high treason.
   
Limited-overs cricket was in its infancy in 1975, at least on the 
international stage. Who would have believed then that an opening 
batsman from an obscure cricket nation calling itself the United Arab 
Emirates would hit six sixes in an innings; or that Kenya might beat 
the West Indies?
   
It is hard enough to believe it even now. Any Rip Van Winkel waking 
from sleep would protest, for a start, that the land beside the Gulf 
is all made of sand: you cannot play cricket on sand, except with a 
soft ball. And Kenya hardly play cricket, do they?
   
As a matter of fact they were playing it just as keenly back in 1975 
when a certain D.Pringle, Donald, the father of Derek, was opening the 
bowling for East Africa. The encouragement of the smaller cricketing 
nations has been the best possible reason for holding a world cricket 
tournament every four years and if anyone needs justification they 
have only to appreciate the fact that both Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe have 
graduated to Test cricket, the highest form of the game, through 
having shown what they could do amongst the game s most famous 
players. Others, like Canada and Israel, have not been able to 
capitalise on the chances which the World Cup gave them to expand the 
game in their countries, but it can and should be a global sport. It 
is, after all, the best team game invented by man.
    
It has been encouraging to see how the present World Cup has warmed up 
in the last week after a slow start. Because of the decision to have a 
quarter-final round for the first time some of the early games were 
largely meaningless: a succession of more-or-less dull, more-or-less 
predictable matches played with varying degrees of skill by players 
dressed in clothes only slightly less garishly ghastly than the very 
worst examples of the genre. In Pakistan, but not in India, crowds at 
some of the  venues have been small.
    
Suddenly, however, the tournament has genuinely come alive. The 
India/Australia match was the first really classic encounter and it 
was followed by the good game in Karachi between Pakistan and South 
Africa, the extraordinary upsetting of those weary and downcast West 
Indians by the elated and delightfully surprised Kenyans and, this 
very weekend, by the merry dash to a most  impressive victory over  
India by Sri Lanka. One begins to think that Sri Lanka could have 
finished top of their group even if the Australians had actually gone 
to Colombo to play.
    
This is all so very different from that first day of World Cup cricket 
at Lord s on the 7th of June 1975. A beautiful day it was, too: it is 
a curious fact that in the first three tournaments, all held in 
England s notorious climate, there was hardly ever a problem with the 
weather and never for a final.
    
Matches were played over 60 overs in days when captains were not quite 
so fussy about their field placings and in a country where daylight 
can last well beyond ten o clock on a balmy day in mid-summer. The 
first final was not won by the West Indies, at the end of an epic 
battle against Australia, until 8.42 PM. No one had thought of cricket 
under floodlights at that stage, at least not seriously so.
     
No one thought, either, that there might be a case for holding the 
competition somewhere other than the UK. It seemed the ideal place 
because of easy transport inside a small island and the cosmopolitan 
population there is no shortage of support in England for India, 
Pakistan or the West Indies and we even allow a few Australians in!
     
India s sensational defeat of the West Indies in the third final in 
1983 changed that thinking. It was absolutely right, of course, that a 
global competition should be staged in different parts of the globe. 
India and Pakistan proved that no continent was too big in 1987 and, 
moreover, that these two great cricketing countries could bury any 
political differences in order to co-operate in a sporting project. It 
is extremely sad that Sri Lanka should, because of politics, have been 
deprived of their fair share of games this time.
    
Australia, meanwhile, raised the commercial stakes even higher in the 
fifth World Cup, with television beaming the event to more people than 
ever and every corner of the earth. Regrettably, to my mind, this 
meant that every team wore the vulgar clothes which have become the 
trademark of night cricket, although the night cricket itself always 
was a great idea for hot climates. Names on the back of shirts makes 
sense too, but I do wish a designer of taste could produce clothes 
which are predominantly white, with subtle differences for each side, 
and which mirror the elegance of cricket.
    
Tactics and expectations have changed, alongwith the clothes. Sides 
chase totals now which once would have been deemed  impossible. The 
introduction of circles, a far-sighted Australian idea, has increased 
the problems of captains  in the field and made it much more difficult 
to stop batsmen with negative  bowling. The outfielding itself, on the 
other hand, reaches new levels of  athleticism every year. If you are 
not quick and fit in international cricket  these days, you are left 
behind.
    
Where once most captains were agreed that an attack of five deadly 
accurate medium-pacers was ideal, there is true variety in the attacks 
we are seeing in the present tournament with wrist spinners happily to 
the fore. It is marvellous for the game that attacking bowlers of 
great skill like Warne, Mushtaq Ahmed, Kumble, Adams and Strang are 
being used with confidence and success. Given proper encouragement and 
sensible handling, Ian Salisbury would have improved the England side, 
too. Off-spinners are now restricted to only five leg-side fielders, 
which makes them much less effective  than they were when the likes of 
Emburey, Marks and Hemmings helped England to reach three of the first 
five finals.
    
They do not look like getting there this time on present  form, but 
who knows what will happen when the knockout stage begins later this 
week? World Cup cricket is evolving still and, like Pakistan last 
time, any team with flair, imagination and spirit may yet sweep to 
success in Lahore on Sunday week.

<A NAME="allr">Allrounders taken by surprise</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, March 4: The World Cup has been treated to a series of 
superlative head-to-heads.
    
The spinners have bewitched, the pacemen, led by Pakistan s Waqar 
Younis, delighted. The batsmen, with Sachin Tendulkar and Mark Waugh 
scaling unprecedented heights, have startled.
    
The battle of the all-rounders, however, has failed to live up to the 
legend. No single figure has emerged to capture the World Cup 
imagination. The crown of Imran Khan, Kapil Dev, Ian Botham and Sir 
Richard Hadlee, it seems, will remain dusty and unclaimed.
    
There is still time, of course, for Wasim Akram of Pakistan, Steve 
Waugh of Australia and Brian McMillan to change that.
    
McMillan is the only man to appear in the top 20 world computer 
rankings for both batting and bowling.
    
His pace bowling would not discredit the first overs of a Test match, 
while he is quite capable of batting at number three in either form of 
the game.
    
Pakistan skipper Wasim, in contrast, is primarily a fine left-arm pace 
bowler, his stylish crash-bang-wallop batting a bonus. Waugh is now an 
out-and-out batsman, whose mounting success has left his useful 
medium-pace seamers, curtailed by a shoulder injury, in the shade.
    
To date, the trio have failed to set the world on fire.
    
McMillan s bowling has been a key South African weapon, slowing down 
opposition charges. There have only been four wickets, three of them 
for 11 against the Emirates, but he has constantly threatened while 
conceding under three runs an over.
    
His batting appearances, however, have produced meagre fare. A late 
entry against England saw him go for 11 while he blew his big chance 
at number three against Pakistan when Waqar Younis crushed his toes 
with a high-speed in-dipping yorker to dismiss him for a single.
    
Wasim has only had one bat for a useful 32 not out against the South 
Africans. His bowling, however, has yet to convince, with only three 
wickets   two against the Emirates   and costing over four an over.
    
Waugh s batting   an 82 against Kenya, a cruel run-out against India 
when his twin s return drive was deflected into the non-striker s 
stumps and a 57 against the West Indies   looks classy. His bowling, 
however, neutered by the slow, undeviating pitches, looks less than 
frightening.
    
The Australian s reputation was not helped by Kapil Dev, the great 
Indian legend, who dismissed him as a sham.
    
 Only those with 200 wickets and 2,000 runs can be classified as all-
rounders. Waugh is a good support man, but you can  call him a genuine 
all-rounder, like Ian Botham, Richard Hadlee, Imran Khan or myself,  
he said.
    
Chris Cairns of New Zealand, another genuine contender, has managed a 
cameo 36 against England and a 52 with the bat against Holland but 
just one wicket.
    
None of the all-rounders, significantly, has earned a man of the match 
award. McMillan probably deserves the first-round honours by virtue of 
his exceptional catching at slip.
    
These are not the bits-and-pieces cricketers of yesterday. The likes 
of Aamir Sohail, Mark Waugh, Shaun Pollock and Manoj Prabhakar   and 
even South African Jonty Rhodes, the one fielder-batsman in the world 
  are world-class performers in one field while providing highly-
valued support in another.
      
Waugh has proved the point with 362 runs in four innings at an average 
of 120. Against India, he made 126. But it was his off-spin which won 
the match by dismissing Tendulkar and he also took Brian Lara s scalp 
against the West Indies.
    
Sohail did as well against England on Sunday. His left-arm spin was 
good enough to spark an collapse by bowling Mike Atherton and having 
Graeme Hick stumped. He then made 42 in an opening stand of 81. That 
all-round effort was enough to earn the man of the match award.

<A NAME="newc">New cricket culture: its ethos & ethic</A>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
S. A. Meenai

INTIKHAB Alam s disputed interview has thrown into sharp focus the 
anomalies and anachronism of the Sixth World Cup format. The statement 
attributed to the manager of the Pakistan team has not only laid bare 
the tricks of the trade but has taken the lid off the schemes chalked 
out in the inner sanctums of closed rooms. Hence the disclaimer after 
the disclosure.
    
The flurry of startling upsets   there may be a few still in store   
has lent a dicey dimension to the glorious (inglorious) uncertainties 
of cricket. But what is so peculiar or preposterous about them? After 
all they are a part of the game and in its one-day version the most 
unexpected sometimes happens. Didn t Zimbabwe baffle Australia and 
didn t India turn the tables on West Indies in 1983?

Why then questions are being asked and doubts are aired about the 
actual or possible outcomes? Have the results been genuine or some of 
them were contrived? Is it all method-oriented and manoeuvred or 
incidental and fortuitous? For clues to these riddles one must look 
into the framework of the on-going tournament and the radical changes 
in the approach towards the game over the years.

The curious pattern of the current contest is a medley of the league 
and knock-out systems. A departure from the set structure was made in 
the third World Cup of 1983 as unlike the first two, in the 
preliminary groups the sides played each other not once but twice. 
This innovation minimised the chances of accidental ousters.

Under the present formula governing the Cup matches, the real struggle 
starts after the quarter-final which makes the contest a touch-and-go 
affair. Naturally the contestants are duly wary and a bit worried 
about the opponents as also about the venues. Conventional adversaries 
are more concerned than others in this connection. Like England and 
Australia in the context of Ashes, India and Pakistan have also a 
history in cricketing terms too.

In this backdrop, several back-room strategies must be engaging the 
attention of Managers and captains as the Cup comes to the crunch. All 
available options and alternatives ought to be examined in the given 
context and of course they include surrendering of certain advantages 
to secure the ultimate goal.

Borrowing an analogy from chess or bridge one might appreciate the 
situation better. At times pawns have to be sacrificed to create an 
opening for an assault on the fort just as the art of discarding may 
be a necessary stratagem to win a hand or even a rubber. Similarly 
strategic withdrawals and tactical retreats are acknowledged weapons 
of defence.
    
If Pakistan or India in a bid to avoid confrontation at a crucial turn 
  which seems in inevitable now   thought of conceding a match to some 
other team for an eventual advantage, those conversant with their 
history and psychology should not have been surprised.

That such deliberate moves make a mockery of morality is besides the 
point. Ever since the advent of commercialism, and more specifically 
in the post-packer era cricket has ceased to be a sport that once 
symbolised sportsmanship. The consideration upper most now is 
salesmanship. Modern cricket is evolving its own ethos and ethic.
