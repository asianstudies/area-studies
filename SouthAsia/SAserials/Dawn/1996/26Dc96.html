<a name="trem">Tremor shakes parts of Karachi</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 20: An earthquake of mild intensity shook a sleepy 
Karachi awake early on Friday morning at 7.21 am. The epicentre of 
the tremor, which measured 4.0 on the Richter scale was 
approximately 520 km south-east of Karachi near Rajkot in the 
Indian state of Gujarat, according to the seismic monitoring 
network of Pakistan and the Meteorological (MET) Department.
    
The tremor lasted a very short time, less than a second, and was 
followed by minor aftershocks, which were not felt in Karachi, a 
spokesman for the MET office told Dawn. He said that the occurrence 
of a tremor and its aftershocks were analogous to a pendulum. The 
first swing was the greatest and each successive swing was smaller 
than the previous one, he said.

The Met office spokesman said that underground explosions also 
create seismic waves but they were registered separately from 
naturally occurring seismic shockwaves. He said that this tremor 
was certainly a natural one, not man-made.
    
The main tremor was strong enough, however, to wake up many 
Karachiites on a usually sleepy Friday morning.

<a name="care">Caretakers fail to produce charges: report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Dec 24: The US and Canadian media has begun to reflect 
a sense of disappointment over the failure of Pakistans caretaker 
government to produce any evidence against ousted Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto and her husband.
    
Two major newspapers on Tuesday published identical reports saying 
almost seven weeks after the dismissal of Bhutto, the caretaker 
government has started to look as precarious as the one it 
replaced.
    
The Toronto Globe & Mail and Washington Times reported from 
Islamabad that the powerful President Leghari had been unable to 
produce formal corruption charges against Benazir and her husband 
or deliver the election reforms, he claimed, were needed to secure 
democracy.
    
Even Mr Legharis repeated promise of elections on Feb 3 remains 
in doubt, the newspapers said.
    
The report said: Despite embarrassing corruption charges against 
the interim cabinet, Mr Leghari has stood firmly by his ministers. 
He assured the public that fresh elections would be held and 
promised new measures to prevent loan defaulters and tax evaders 
from contesting the polls.
    
If the proposed regulations are legislated and enforced, they 
could bar both Ms Benazir Bhutto and Opposition leader Nawaz 
Sharif, who is considered a major loan defaulter, from seeking 
elected office for the next five years, the papers said.
    
But many observers doubt the reforms can be implemented before the 
elections and serious questions remain about whether the interim 
regime can ensure a fair contest anyway, the reports said.
    
The Washington Times said the accusations of rampant corruption and 
deteriorating law and order could now be made against Legharis 
own interim cabinet. Recent Pakistani Press reports revealed old 
ties between interim PM Meraj Khalid and some of Pakistans drug 
barons.
    
These people do not have a certificate from God that they are 
clean, the reports quoted a former PPP MNA from Karachi Wajha 
Karim Dad.

<a name="emph">Emphasis on accountability of bureaucracy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
R.M.U. Suleman

CARETAKER Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid has said that certain 
members of the bureaucracy and other exploitative classes are 
trying to frustrate the process of accountability and thwart the 
caretakers efforts to formulate basic policy guidelines which they 
want to spell out future directions in all walks of life.
    
Corruption at all levels, political as well as bureaucratic, is a 
fact of life in Pakistan that is eating into the vitals of the 
countrys economy. This reality has also been affirmed by 
independent studies carried out by reputable international agencies 
as Transparency International (TI) which has classed Pakistan as 
the second most corrupt country in the world after Nigeria.
    
It is universally recognised that corruption always moves from top 
(politics) down (bureaucracy). This implication is there even in 
the aforesaid remarks of the caretaker PM. His predecessor has been 
even more categorical in insisting that in Pakistan in general, and 
during her regime in particular, there has been hardly any 
corruption at the political level.
    
In support of her claim, the ousted PM presented the evidence, that 
when the list of top defaulters was presented in the National 
Assembly, 97 per cent of them were not politicians, but 
businessmen. No bureaucrats were, of course, identified in this 
rogues gallery of bank defaulters.
    
Even the 3 per cent share of politicians in the rogues gallery is 
rather surprising, since in all civilised countries, politicians 
and businessmen have been separated into at least formal non-
competing groups. This does not mean that politicians do not reap 
the rich fruits of business. They do, but do it through surrogates. 
Conversely, most big politicians are surrogates of big business in 
developed countries.
    
As for the high ratio (97 per cent) of non-politicians among the 
top bank defaulters, the political involvement of politicians must 
obviously be far too high. Without effective big politician 
interest, it is impossible in this country to secure big business 
loans, deliberately with heavy under-collateralisation, that are 
hard to recover, whatever stringent recovery laws are enforced.
    
Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. A 
bureaucracy becomes autonomous and exercises near-absolute power 
when the process of class formation is weak or when no class is 
dominant. This is certainly not the case in Pakistan, where the 
feudal or landed class still retains the dominant position. Once a 
class becomes dominant and retains its dominance, the autonomy of 
the bureaucracy ceases to exist and it becomes an instrument in the 
hands of the dominant class. Since the Pakistan bourgeoisie is also 
now in the process of establishing its dominance, the Pakistani 
bureaucracy will soon lose its autonomy and power still further.
    
Even when the position of dominant classes in a society is fully 
crystallised, the need of bureaucracy, civil and military, as 
junior partners in the crime of corruption still remains. It was 
thus quite in the fitness of things that just a day before its 
ouster, the federal cabinet of Benazir Bhutto had formed two 
committees to scrutinise the declarations of assets and liabilities 
filed annually by government officers.
    
The first committee was to scrutinise the declarations of 
government servants working in Grades 17 to 19. It was to be headed 
by the minister of the concerned ministry and establishment 
secretary or his representative and the secretary of the ministry 
concerned were to be its members.
    
The second committee was to scrutinise statements of officers in 
Grade 20 and above and was to be headed by the prime minister. The 
chairmen of the Federal Anti-Corruption Committee (FACC) and Prime 
Ministers Inspection Commission (PMIC) and secretaries of the 
Establishment and Cabinet Division were to be the members of this 
committee.
    
If any mis-declaration was found during scrutiny or the committee 
was informed through any other source, the concerned agencies were 
to be asked to check and verify the declaration. The formation of 
the committees for scrutinising the declarations was expected to 
end the controversy between the FACC and senior government servants 
who had been refusing to file declarations for scrutiny with the 
FACC, questioning its authority.
    
The cabinet was told that since the exercise involved a huge volume 
of information-gathering spread over an 11-year period, the 
committee was not in a position to submit its findings readily.
    
The cabinet directed the special committee to speed up its work and 
submit its report at the earliest as it would help in de-
politicising bureaucracy. The cabinet also decided to make 
necessary amendments in the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules 
1964 to take disciplinary action against those civil servants who 
unauthorisedly acquire government record, documents or information 
or communicate it directly or indirectly to anyone not authorised 
to receive it.
 
On November 4 the caretaker federal cabinet approved the 
accountability bill to net corrupt politicians and civilian and 
military bureaucrats. Unlike the original draft bill, envisaging 
accountability of all armymen, the caretakers agreed to partial 
accountability of military personnel on temporary civilian 
appointments.
    
Army officers are inducted in the civil services and also appointed 
on lucrative posts in the civilian organisations but had never been 
held accountable even if there were reports of corruption against 
them. They are appointed as heads of public sector organisations 
like Pakistan Steel Mills, Pakistan Ordnance Factories, Oil and Gas 
Development Corporation, Water and Power Development Authority, 
Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation, Sui Gas Company etc. 
Military Procurements have also traditionally been notorious for 
kickbacks and commissions.
    
The President has been excluded from accountability because of 
constitutional protection to him under Article 248 (2). A similar 
immunity has also been extended to provincial governors. Whatever 
the constitutional provision, the fact of the Presidents wielding 
absolute power needs to be duly considered.

Histrionics

Some of the causes of bureaucratic corruption are specific to 
Pakistan. To begin with, there were huge chunks of evacuee 
property, urban and rural, available for allotment to hordes of 
refugees from India, particularly from the agreed areas for mass 
exchange of population. For expeditious rehabilitation, these 
allotments involved massive exercise of discretionary powers. Since 
humans are not angels, few could resist the temptation of 
corruption, which soon became deeply ingrained in society.
    
In the shrinking remnants of the iron frame, the main fault was 
arrogance rather than corruption, which long remained an exception 
rather than the rule. This position was decisively changed with the 
selective and arbitrary cashiering of senior bureaucracy by Ayub 
Khan. Yahya Khan did one better by his well-known retirement of 
three-knot-three: The civilian martial law of ZAB turned this 
number to thousands and increased the arbitrariness of the whole 
exercise.
    
When Gen. Zia came to power, this scribe along with some others was 
engaged part-time in an interesting research study entitled 
Negative Bureaucratic Behaviour, a nice euphemism for 
bureaucratic corruption. It was a multi-country, Canadian 
organised, and financed study.
    
The Pakistan Administrative Staff (PASC) College was handling the 
study in Pakistan with a multi-disciplinary team representing 
revenue collection, expenditure control, import and export control, 
police, etc. As the team entered the crucial report-writing stage, 
there was suddenly an order from the federal Establishment Division 
to stop all work on the study forthwith.
    
The irony of the story was that the Secretary Establishment who 
signed the stop-study order had also earlier initiated and 
supervised the study in his capacity as the Principal PASC. From 
him it was learnt that the new ruling Zia team took bureaucracy to 
be its strongest collaborator. The report, it was assumed, would 
definitely be anti-bureaucratic and the government of the day did 
not want to rattle its most valuable collaborator.
    
During the restoration comedy, bureaucracy was deemed to be a clay 
in the hands of the political overlords who could mould it in any 
form they liked. The Caretaker PM, Moeen Qureshi, felt the need for 
bringing in suitable Civil Service Rules that could provide 
security of tenure and independence to bureaucracy. The successor 
Benazir government was happy to see these Rules lapse.
    
The new caretaker government has yet to find time to devote to such 
matters. Dr. Mubashir Hasan has urged the amendment of Civil 
Service Rules to empower senior government servants to take 
disciplinary action against their subordinates as a part of a 
general move for decentralisation. A totally pliant bureaucracy can 
neither be efficient nor honest.

<a name="cabi">Cabinet split over recovery from defaulters</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

SHARP differences have developed in the caretaker cabinet over some 
important economic and financial matters, including the definition 
of a defaulter. It has now approached President Farooq Leghari to 
help iron out the differences.
    
The President is believed to have expressed his inability to offer 
any instant solution specially over the question of defaulters and 
that is why about dozens of cases were lying pending, waiting to be 
entertained either by Chief Ehtesab Commissioner, banking tribunal 
or any court.
    
The ministers of law and interior had given their reports 
recommending early initiation of cases against about 40 defaulters. 
However since the cabinet has not reached a decision how to deal 
with the issue, the officials concerned were purtubed and called 
for taking an early decision.
    
The most irritating question being discussed over which no decision 
could be taken due to sharp differences was the definition of 
defaulters. Insiders said that some of the members, including the 
Prime Ministers Adviser on Political Affairs and Accountability, 
Najam Sethi, Advisor on Finance, Planning and Economic Affairs 
Shahid Javed Burki, Minister for Petroleum Javed Jabbar and 
Minister for Industries Brig.(retd) Sadiq Awan, were demanding that 
the defaulters should not be given any relief and that their loans 
must be recovered. 
   
And in case they refused to pay their loans in a matter of days 
then criminal cases must be prepared against them for transferring 
to the Chief Ehtesab Commissioner. On the other side some others 
including Minister for Education, Science, and Technology, Begum 
Syed Abida Hussain, who has resigned, and the Minister for Defence 
and Establishment, Mr. Shahid Hamid, has been pleading that the 
defaulters be given enough time and that their loans should be 
generously considered for rescheduling.
    
Those who were seeking payment by defaulters are also said to have 
called for handing over two separate lists containing names of 
about 500 people to the concerned organisations. But the others in 
the cabinet specially Abida and Shahid Hamid had a soft corner for 
the defaulters. 
   
It is interesting to note that the president who on the one hand, 
directed the caretakers to recover at least Rs. 30 to 40 billion, 
out of Rs.140 billion outstanding loans, has not been able to 
remove the confusion on the definition of a defaulter.

<a name="cust">Customs deny seizure of gold from Asif</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
LAHORE, Dec 23: The customs department has categorically denied 
having seized gold or antiques being smuggled out by former federal 
minister Asif Ali Zardari or any person connected with him.
    
In its report and para-wise comments on a petition filed by 
advocate M.D. Tahir for safe deposit and custody of Rs 700 million 
reportedly recovered from Mr Zardari at the time of his arrest from 
the Governors House, Lahore, on the night between November 4 and 5 
and of gold and antiques allegedly intercepted and seized by the 
Customs while being smuggled out by him, the department said the 
news in a Lahore Urdu daily on which the allegations were based was 
not authentic.
    
The report, submitted in the Lahore High Court by the Customs 
deputy collector (exports), Mughalpura, Lahore, on Monday, said 
while the petitioner may be an advocate and a citizen of Pakistan 
as stated by him in his petition, he is ignorant of facts and has 
filed a petition without ascertaining them.
    
A few pieces of antique jewellery weighing 119.3 grams were seized 
at the dry port early in October but were handed over to the 
curator of the archaeology department for safe custody and proper 
maintenance as directed by the then prime minister Benazir Bhutto. 
The lawyer should have filed a petition against the newspaper that 
carried the false report, the department said.

Dawn Report

KARACHI, Dec 19: The CIA police on Thursday formally booked Asif 
Ali Zardari in the Mir Murtaza Bhutto case and shifted him from 
Landhi Jail to the Women police station near governor house amid 
tight security.
    
The area was without electricity when Mr Zardari was escorted in an 
APC (PS-9762) by the SSP CIA, Ali Gohar Mithiani, to the Women 
police station. The CIA police will produce him in the court of 
district and sessions judge, South, on Saturday to seek his remand 
for interrogation in the murder case, sources said.
    
His lawyers who met him at 6.30pm on Thursday, told Dawn Mr Zardari 
was very happy with the Sindh High Courts judgement regarding his 
illegal detention. According to his lawyers, Mr Zardari told them: 
I have always, and still have, great respect for and trust in the 
judiciary. I am innocent. They have implicated me in false cases. 
His detention, under maintenance of public order (MPO), was set 
aside by the Sindh High Court on Wednesday, but he was not 
released.

Our Correspondent
    
LARKANA, Dec 24: The ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto, while 
demanding the restoration of her government, has urged President 
Farooq Leghari to step down for, as she put it, sacrificing 
national interests for the sake of his personal interests.
    
Addressing a Press conference at Naudero on Tuesday, she repeated 
the claim that Mr Leghari was very much ambitious to form a Kings 
party.
    
She proposed a meeting between the Leader of the House and the 
Leader of the Opposition after a possible restoration of the 
National Assembly in order to hammer out political strategy to 
establish a stable government and drive out the country from 
political and economic crises.
    
She labelled caretakers as biased and prejudiced and said 
election under Mr Leghari would not be acceptable to the nation. 
Such an election would further deepen the crises facing the 
country, she said claiming that the president wanted to see a hung 
parliament to suit his interests.

LAHORE, Dec 21: The caretaker prime minister, Malik Meraj Khalid on 
Saturday expressed the fear that old faces might return in the 
upcoming elections and called upon the people to vote for sincere 
and honest candidates.
    
Speaking at the Lahore High Court Bar Association, he stated that 
foreign diplomats in Islamabad had told him that they did not 
expect much change after the Feb 3 elections. If that happened, the 
interim PM said, the country would remain unstable and there would 
be no solutions to the countless problems faced by the people.
    
Mr Meraj Khalid also spoke of the difficulties in unearthing 
evidence against the corrupt politicians .
    
Corruption has become so technical that those indulging in it have 
left behind no trace but we are striving to gather the evidence, 
he said.
    
He said unless there was accountability, the situation which 
existed before November 5 would continue.APP

<a name="scas">SC asked to help undo 8th Amendment</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, Dec 22: The Supreme Court was on Sunday requested to order 
the establishment of a constitutional commission to scrutinise the 
8th Amendment and prepare a report which should be submitted to the 
parliament straightaway or after a referendum, for subsequent 
action.
 
The apex court was also requested to declare General Ziaul Haq a 
usurper with effect from March 1981 when he promulgated a 
provisional constitutional order but condone his actions and 
decisions, including the Eighth Amendment, like those of General 
Yahya Khan in Asma Jilani case.
    
Appearing for appellant-lawyer Abdul Mujib Pirzada, his brother, 
Barrister Abdul Hafiz Pirzada said the (late) chief martial law 
administrator himself destroyed whatever legal cover was provided 
to him by the Supreme Court in the 1977 Nusrat Bhutto case by 
nullifying its verdict through his 1981 PCO. His regime no longer 
represented a mere deviation from the Constitution.
    
The general, he submitted, ushered in a new order in the name of 
Islamisation in 1981, appointed a federal council or Majlis-i- 
Shoora of his supporters in place of parliament, combined in 
himself all executive, legislative and judicial functions of the 
state, deprived the citizens of their fundamental rights and the 
superior courts of their jurisdiction to enforce them and, above 
all, prescribed a new oath for superior court judges and 
administered it selectively to those he liked.

<a name="pias">PIA suffering loss of $200,000 a week</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Dec 23. Ever since PIA started its two weekly flights 
from Chicago and Washington in early December, it has been 
suffering losses to the tune of $200,000 per week, highly informed 
sources here told Dawn.
    
PIA introduced from Dec 12, two flights a week from Chicago and two 
from Washington. Both flights which transit through the JFK Airport 
carry the bulk of passengers for New York city. These flights then 
terminate and originate as the case may be from Chicago and 
Washington. Until Monday they carried a total of 15 or 20 
passengers to and from these two new destinations. As a 
consequence, the airline pays more in refuelling and handling of 
flights at these two cities than it can justify.
 
The sources said that every time the PIA flight originates from 
Chicago it incurs an expenditure of over $60,000, same is the case 
in Washington.
    
The main reason for the losses being suffered by the airline is 
that since its major payload is from New York, flights between New 
York and the other two American cities become redundant. Reasons 
why PIA has no payload from either of these two cities are, because 
of its commitments in New York and also because it has not geared 
itself to the service fully, for if it were to be a real 
destination then PIA would have direct flights from the two cities 
to a destination in Europe.
    
According to sources, the airline had not acquired rights to fly 
directly from either Chicago or Washington to a European 
destination and so it has to transit through New York to fly to a 
European destination en route to Pakistan.
    
PIA officials in New York confirmed that only 15 or 20 passengers 
were being carried to and from the two new destinations four times 
a week. The PIA management thinks that ultimately the new 
destinations would become economically viable in long run.
    
Meanwhile, the North American route which accounted for $60 million 
a year in profits is fast becoming a loser.

<a name="uaed">UAE defers giving $350m till polls</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec 22: The United Arab Emirates has expressed regrets 
that it could not accede to Pakistans request for 350 million 
dollars, saying that the matter could be considered only when a new 
government was in place after the Feb 3 elections.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here on Sunday that the visit of prime 
ministers advisor on finance, planning and economic affairs Shahid 
Javed Burki could not achieve the desired results. 
   
The delegation which included the deputy chairman of the planning 
commission, Dr Hafiz Pahsha, and the chairman of the privatisation 
commission, Dr Sulaiman Shah, was told by the UAE authorities that 
at this stage they could not commit anything and would wait for the 
formation of a new government in Pakistan. 
   
Mr Burki had requested the amount to improve the countrys balance 
of payments position.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
KARACHI, Dec 23: The government on Monday borrowed Rs 5.930 billion 
from the banking sectormostly from the state-run banksthrough 
sale of Short Term Federal Bonds.
    
Sources in the money market told Dawn the State Bank of Pakistan 
raised the amount for the government by way of selling the six-
monthly bonds at its weekly auction. 
   
The SBP sold these bonds at an average 17.21 per cent annual 
return with the minimum and maximum yields ranging between 15-17.25 
per cent, one of the sources said.
    
Bankers and money brokers reached by Dawn said the state-run 
National Bank of Pakistan made the largest purchase of a little 
more than Rs 5.0 billion followed by Muslim Commercial Bank (Rs 
800m) and Habib Bank Ltd. (Rs 100m). The market was tight in the 
beginning with call rates ranging between 20- 22 per cent but an 
inflow of Rs400m-500m brought down the rates to 10-12 per cent, 
the treasury manager of a bank said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
KARACHI, Dec 24: The President of Federation of Pakistan Chambers 
of Commerce and Industry, Senator Ilyas Bilour, has said that the 
new World Trade Treaty does not provide a safe future for the 
developing countries and, therefore, urged them to join hands and 
foster economic co-operation among them to effectively deal with 
the emerging situation.
    
Speaking at a luncheon meeting of Indian businessmen at New Delhi, 
organised on Wednesday by the Punjab, Haryana, Delhi Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry, the Senator observed that culmination of 
Uruguay Round of talks into Marakesh Agreement and the creation of 
World Trade Organisation has evoked scepticism among the developing 
countries.
    
A Press release of FPCCI on Wednesday said that Senator Bilour made 
a specific reference to developed countries strategy for phasing 
out Multi Fibre Agreement in the next decade, who on the other hand 
have pressurised the developing countries to open their market for 
textile products from them without any delay.
    
He also spoke of the other barriers on developing countries by the 
developed nations like linking the issue of child labour and 
environment with trade.

<a name="task">Task Force proposes cut in tariffs to 35pc</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec 19: The Task Force on Tariffs has finalised its 
recommendations and presented it to the government, proposing 
reduction in tariffs to 35 per cent in the shortest possible time, 
to be undertaken from 1997-98.
    
The Task Force on Tariffs, headed by me, has suggested that 
tariffs must be brought down to 35 per cent as early as possible 
and the recommendations must be implemented in letter and in spirit 
from the next financial year, said Minister for Commerce Dr 
Mohammad Zubair.
    
He pointed out that the Task Force on Tariffs has given its report 
well in time. He told Dawn here on Thursday that the reduction in 
tariff has always been a problem in Pakistan although previous 
governments had agreed to drastically bring them down. The issue of 
reducing tariffs was one of the major conditionalities of the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF). Pakistan was to reduce its 
tariffs to 55 per cent in 1995-96 but when failed to do so the Fund 
put further restrictions to offer financial support to Pakistan. 
For the current year the target was fixed at 60 per cent which too 
did not seem to be achieved.
    
Our Task Force has called for gradual reduction in tariff rates in 
which revenue impact should also be assessed before eventually 
bringing them down to 35 per cent, the commerce minister said. He 
said: Let us have a competition everywhere for which it is 
necessary to do away with these tariffs.
    
We are trying to make things easy for the future elected 
government by proposing recommendations through various Task Forces 
to improve the overall economic and financial health of the 
country, he added said.

<a name="stoc">Stocks under pressure, suffer erosions on wide front</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 19: Stocks remained under pressure on Thursday and 
suffered price erosions on a wide front, as investors were not 
inclined to make larger commitments despite news of release of held 
up IMF loan of $80 million under the standby arrangement.
    
There was, therefore, no trace of the late Wednesday evening 5.07 
points gain in the index in response to positive news from the aid 
front when the trading resumed as sellers again dominated the 
scene.
    
However, some analysts said the market could respond positively to 
objective news by the next week after it fully digested the 
negative impact of the current galore of rumours aimed at 
resignations of some caretaker federal ministers including the 
prime minister.
    
It was largely the weekend selling which kept the buying interest 
in a low-key and the performance of the market could be a bit 
improved next week though on selected counters.
    
The KSE 100-share index showed a fresh modest decline of 7.06 
points at 1,378.49 as compared to 1,385.55 a day earlier, 
reflecting the weakness of the base shares.
    
Analysts said the market might be terribly upset owing to rumour-
mongering, which points to political instability. There are some 
other bearish news also which are keeping the underlying sentiment 
in the minus column.
    
The news of resumption of IMF credit line is a big news and the 
market has to welcome it sooner or later, they maintained.
    
They said the election uncertainties might continue to take their 
toll after regular intervals but the underlying sentiment could be 
kept intact on the strength of selective support.
    
But some others said the market is terribly short of funds as 
leading players are feeling the pinch of big portfolio losses and 
that could keep the sentiment in low key.
    
However, big decline in some of the leading shares worried 
investors which indicated that a formidable section of leading 
operators is selling in the leading issues, cashing in on the 
available margin of profits.
    
A big sell-off might not be imminent as some of the genuine 
investors are out to sell, prompting fresh selling from others, 
dealers said.
    
A fresh sharp fall of Rs 12 in PSO, which fell to Rs 266 against 
its face value of Rs 10, with 20,500 shares changing hands worried 
investors as a big fall in a blue chip could mean a bad news for 
the entire market.
    
All other leading shares also fell but fractionally. Some of them 
fell sharply under the lead of Dadabhoy Insurance, Dewan Textiles, 
Al-Abid Silk and Hinopak Motors, which has been in strong demand 
over the last few sessions and had risen substantially owing to 
higher earning and a good payout for the last year.
    
Others fell by Rs 1.25 to Rs 5, biggest decline of Rs 5 being again 
in Dadabhoy Insurance, followed by Lease Pakistan and Pak Gulf 
Insurance.
    
Textile and banks shares fell in unison, although fractionally but 
some of them managed to finish higher under the lead of Fateh 
Textiles, which rose by Rs 5.
    
Synthetic shares followed them on active short-covering at the 
lower levels and rose, major gainers among them being Gatron 
Industries and Dhan Fibre.
    
Other good gainers were led by KASB & Co, Pakistan Oilfields and 
Adamjee Insurance, which posted gains ranging from one rupee to Rs 
2.
    
The most active list was again topped by Hub-Power, steady five 
paisa on 7.348m, followed by PTC vouchers, lower 20 paisa on 
6.457m, ICI Pakistan, easy 35 paisa on 3.070m, Dhan Fibre, firm 
five paisa on 1.590m, and FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, unchanged on 
1.328m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by ICI Pakistan (r), easy 
five paisa on 0.428m, Dewan Salman, lower 50 paisa on 0.376m, 
Sunflow Citruss, off 50 paisa on 0.375m, Faysal Bank, up 40 paisa 
on 0.297m, D. G. Khan Cement, unchanged on 0.169m, and Askari Bank, 
up 50 paisa on 0.165m shares.
    
Trading volume fell to 24.182 million shares from the previous 
29.454m shares, owing to the absence of leading buyers.
    
There were 308 actives out of which 141 shares fell, 90 rose with 
77 holding on to the last levels.

'<a name="ehte">Ehtesab' or 'Intekhab'?  2</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee 

NO government can be forgiven for looting the people's money, 
whether it be donated or deposited by or extracted or extorted from 
them. 
    
The sin is compounded a hundred-fold when it loots for its own 
nefarious purposes, its own trusts specifically established, and 
which by law are solely to be used "for the help and assistance of 
destitute and needy widows, orphans, invalids, infirm and other 
needy persons." When a government loots, intentionally misusing its 
own laws, it commits, without doubt, criminal breach of trust.
    
What follows is a sordid tale of sordid deeds done by persons 
deserving of the same adjective. On March 24, 1994, former Interior 
Minister Major-General Naseerullah Babar wrote to M.A.K. Chaudhry, 
the Chairman (Ameen, 'the most trustworthy') of the Pakistan Bait-
ul-Mal (PBM) on the subject of "request of Mir Ahmedan Raheja Bugti 
for justice and protection." On March 31, Naseerullah telephoned 
the Chairman insisting that a sum of Rs 10 million be made 
immediately available for that purpose. The same day, the Chairman, 
instead of denying the request outright, wrote to the General:
    
"1) There is no precedent of Bait-ul-Mal assistance to such a large 
group of persons who are displaced on account of political 
persecution.
    
"2) The procedure laid down by the Board of Management (BoM) 
requires every recipient of financial assistance to fill an 
application form which has to be verified by the local Zakat 
Committee and another official/respectable. This procedure will 
obviously have to be bypassed.
    
"3) The scale of assistance laid down by the BoM is Rs 2,500 per 
applicant where his application is not properly verified. This is, 
therefore, the scale permissible.
    
"4) If sanctioned, this assistance can only be a one-time grant as 
a very special case."
    
Having written so, he asked if the matter could wait until the BoM 
met on April 17. If not, he as Chairman could take the decision "as 
per directive of the Prime Minister" and issue a cheque for Rs 10 
million "in the name of some responsible authority like the 
Governor of Balochistan." A copy of the letter was endorsed to 
Tahir Mohammed Khan Niazi, "Advisor to Mr Asif Ali Zardari, 
Minister, Islamabad, with reference to our telephone conversation."
    
On April 3, 1994, Ahmad Sadiq presided over a meeting called at 
short notice. Present were Ameen Chaudhry, Interior Secretary 
Jamshed Burki, Addl. Secretary, Special Education and Social 
Welfare, M. Hassan, two JSs of the PM's Secretariat, Nasir Hussain 
and Yasrab Malik, Section officer, Ministry of SE & SW, Sarafaraz 
Ali and "a number of Bugti tribe leaders."
    
The very next day, April 4, duly allowing himself to be 
intimidated, the Ameen, in total disregard and dereliction of his 
duty, issued a cheque in the amount of Rs 10 million in the 
personal name of "Major-General (Retd) Naseerullah Khan Babar", 
drawn on the State Bank of Pakistan, Lahore (PBM cheque no. 
000039).
    
On April 24, another cheque for Rs 10 million was issued in the 
same name (PBM cheque no. 000043), for the same purpose.
    
Two crimes begot a third. On November 23, 1994, the Ameen signed a 
third cheque made out to "the Governor of Balochistan" in the sum 
of Rs 30 million (PBM cheque 000067), for the "rehabilitation of 
Bugti-Kalpar tribesmen." This was done in compliance with the Prime 
Minister's secretariat's letter U.O. No. 5(13)/E&F.1/94 dated 
November 16 1994.
    
The total of Rs 50 million was supposedly to be distributed to the 
Rahejan and Kalpar Bugtis to support the tribal warfare being waged 
by them against Nawab Mohammed Akbar Shahbaz Khan, Tumandar Bugti, 
and to keep him pinned down in his ancestral home at Dera Bugti. 
The reasoning might have been: 'an enemy of an enemy is my friend.' 
The purpose: to perpetuate the PPP rule in Balochistan. Whether or 
not this money enriched the Bugtis and the Kalpars, or some others, 
the fact is that it was money wilfully misappropriated and 
misspent. A crime.
    
On the receipts produced for the PBM the same five thumbs were 
impressed upon five lots of receipts: 325, 265, 118, 114, and 80, 
all for hundreds of small amounts.
    
Apart from this, the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal was further depleted by 
"Ms. Naheed Khan, Political Secretary to the Prime Minister" and 
"one Mr Rehmat Ullah, a consultant to the Prime Minister." In gross 
violation of all rules, sums totalling Rs 6.171 million and Rs 
27.05 million were sanctioned on their 'directions.' Cheques 
totalling Rs 34,099,909 made in the names of various persons were 
also collected by her from the PBM.
    
The Ameen, and each of the persons mentioned above, are thus 
undoubtedly guilty of having committed criminal breach of trust. 
The people ask whether all those named above cannot be held 
accountable and charged under, amongst others, the following 
sections of the Pakistan Penal Code?
    
Section 409 PPC: "Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with 
property, or with any dominion over property in his capacity of a 
public servant or in the way of his business as a banker, merchant, 
factor, broker, attorney or agent, commits criminal breach of trust 
in respect of that property, shall be punished with imprisonment 
for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term 
which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine."
    
Section 109, PPC: "Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act 
abetted is committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express 
provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such abetment, 
be punished with the punishment provided for the offence."
    
Section 34 PPC: "When a criminal act is done by several persons, in 
furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is 
liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him 
alone."
    
All read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption, 1947: 
Act II:
    
"Any public servant who commits or attempts to commit criminal 
misconduct shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which 
may extend to seven years, or with fine, or with both."
    
In the fitness of things, the Governors of Punjab and the NWFP, 
retired Lt.-General Raja Saroop Khan and retired Major General 
Khurshid Ali Khan, chose to resign rather than dissolve their 
assemblies at the behest of the President. The Governors of Sindh 
and Balochistan, Barrister Kamaluddin Azfar and Lt.-General (retd) 
Imranullah Khan, chose to do the President's bidding, issued their 
dissolution orders, and stayed on. Why were they not sent home? 
Having not been sent home, why did they not go home voluntarily?
    
Benazir, as prime minister, presided over the cabinet, and as 
finance minister, presided over the economic committee of the 
cabinet (ECC). She controlled all the money coming in and all the 
money going out. She was directly responsible for appointing 
corrupt supine men who headed our NCBs, DFIs, DBPs and the NIT. The 
bad debts (non-performing loans) of the first three totalled Rs 
62.592 billion at the end of 1993. Thereafter, money was loaned by 
these institutions, and not collected by them. Today, the bad debts 
total Rs 96.238 billion (Rs 9,623 crores), an increase of over 53 
per cent.
    
For the first time in the history of Pakistan a nationalised bank, 
UBL, has actually declared a loss on its balance sheet. Again, for 
the first time, NIT is unable to buy back its units across the 
counter. Unit holders wait for months before they can encash their 
units. When NIT does buy back, it does so at the rate of Rs 13.70 
per unit, whereas the net asset value of the units remaining with 
it is estimated to be in the region of Rs 8 each. Each time a unit 
is encashed the value of the units remaining with NIT decreases. 
The state and the people are expected to suffer and bear the loss 
created by this colossal theft.
    
There is not an iota of doubt that during Benazir's two rounds and 
Nawaz's one, the country was massively and comprehensively robbed. 
If the existing laws, and the laws being framed today, are unable 
to incriminate and disqualify at least the entire cabinets of the 
three governments, strict liability laws must now, without delay, 
be promulgated, i.e. should a prima facie case be established, the 
accused must then prove his innocence. The burden of proof should 
be reversed.
    
Should this caretaker government allow the robbers and wrongdoers 
of the past three governments to be 'elected' to rule over them, 
the people will hold that the President and his ministers have 
conspired to so do, and will hold them responsible at the bar of 
the people's justice. Accountability takes time. The President 
must, as he is obliged to do under the Constitution, hold a 
referendum and let the people decide what they want first  ehtesab 
or intekhab?

<a name="towa">Towards continuous accountability</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Zia-ul-Islam

THE caretaker government is reportedly considering the setting up 
of permanent accountability cells in all departments of the federal 
government. This is no doubt a great idea. It is also the most 
difficult to achieve, keeping in view that more than a dozen 
departments, cells and teams are busy full-time in this very 
exercise, working day and night to achieve a perfect zero score.
    
The Press reports say that a two-member cell consisting of the 
secretary of the department and another senior officer may be 
formed for this purpose. The funny part of the report is that great 
difficulty is being experienced in finding really honest senior 
officers in various departments who could be appointed in these so-
called accountability cells. Leaving aside the genuine difficulties 
which will surely be faced regarding the search for honest people 
for the cells, one can be sure of one thing.
    
The idea that there should be permanent cells must have come from 
one of the caretaker rulers, most probably the Prime Minister 
himself. The other bright idea  that these cells should be manned 
by the secretary and another senior officer of the department 
itself  must surely have originated from some clever bureaucrat. 
While the interim rulers may be trying to do the business of 
cleaning up the national stables (no pun intended), the 
bureaucrats, who are definitely not interim and who are fully 
conscious of the fact that, after all, they have to do business as 
usual at the end of this whole affair, are taking care to make 
sure that their apple-carts are not upset during the stay of the 
caretakers.
    
At the end of the day, when all the excitement of elections (or the 
postponement thereof, on which considerable amounts of satta money 
is being slapped) is over and all the accountability accounts 
have been closed, these very poor, over-worked civil servants will 
be called upon by the nation to put things back in a neat order 
from where they had started fifty years ago. Of course, the last 
thing they would like at that time would be to find some drastic 
changes in the system which may pose hurdles in adopting the old, 
familiar, well- trodden ways. Hence the excellent advice: appoint 
two senior people from the department itself to carry out their own 
accountability!
    
Humour aside, there is no such thing as self-accountability. God 
didnt make man from that kind of stuff. The earlier we understand 
this basic principle, the better for us, or whatever remains of us. 
All efforts and attempts at holding accountability festivals in 
this country have gone down the drain because we have steadfastly 
stuck to the principle that we are our own best judges.
    
All our accountability organs are, in real terms, based on this 
principle. The anti-corruption departments are manned by the same 
people who find themselves on the other side of the table within 
days. Anti-corruption committees are headed by the same civil 
servants who are in positions where they should be under close 
watch. The same is true of the hordes of other organs which are 
responsible for holding bureaucrats accountable. Even the 
Ombudsmens offices are cramped with officers from the police, DMG 
and other groups. In our system, today a person is posted as 
hatchet man and tomorrow, some times literally, he is squarely 
tucked under the same hatchet. No doubt, the nation is sick and 
tired in its search for accountability.
    
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United states has an 
accountability system that is working in a near-perfect manner for 
over a hundred years. They have an inspection wing which has an 
officer at every level corresponding to the officer in the IRS. 
Copies of all assessment and other orders passed by Revenue Agents 
(equivalent to our Income Tax Officers or Assistant Commissioners) 
are automatically passed on to the officers corresponding to that 
level in the inspection wing. Similarly, copies of appellate orders 
are handed over to the higher-level officers in the inspection wing 
and so on. The process is in-built and goes on smoothly, 
automatically and without any fuss. All orders are thus scrutinised 
almost as soon as they are passed. If there appears anything wrong 
or improper, the inspection wing takes notice and moves immediately 
to rectify the situation. Those who pass orders are aware that 
their orders are all the time under close, detailed scrutiny and 
are therefore careful in what they write.
    
Of course the inspection wing consists of people who do not belong 
to the IRS department. They are not inter-transferable with the IRS 
officers and they do not fall under the head of the IRS. On the 
contrary, they are highly paid officers who report directly to the 
Finance Secretary.
    
If we wish to introduce real accountability among our civil 
servants, we should devise systems similar to the one mentioned 
above. The present set of organs meant for this job are not only 
useless; they are definitely counter-productive. Most of them are 
themselves biggest sources of corruption and filth in this country. 
They need to be disbanded summarily and replaced by a new set of 
institutions.
    
Let there be an inspection wing attached to each department 
performing functions similar to those mentioned above. In our case 
officers in this wing may be recruited from the judiciary for a 
fixed four-year, non-extendable term. While they are serving in the 
wing they should get handsome extra salaries and they should report 
directly to a specially constituted bench of the High Court in the 
case of the provinces and of the Supreme Court in the case of the 
federal government. Where will all the money come from, and where 
will all the hundreds of justices and judges to man the wings come 
from? These problems have perfectly valid solutions, provided there 
is the will to get at the roots of corruption, which, at this 
juncture in the history of Pakistan, I believe there is.
    
The Supreme Court should arrange a competitive examination on the 
same lines as the one arranged for the superior civil services, to 
recruit a corps of judges of the same level as a sessions judge. In 
fact, such an exam should be held annually to recruit all kind of 
judges, doing away the system of nominating judges of their choice 
by successive governments. Now that the judiciary in this country 
has begun to assert itself, giving a final ray of hope to the 
people, it is the duty of the existing members of the judiciary to 
make sure that only the best people are henceforth inducted into 
their ranks. And there is no system better than a comprehensive 
written test of the kind in vogue for the CSS candidates.
    
As for the money, there will really be no shortage of it if a real, 
effective ban is imposed on (a) fresh recruitment of all kinds for 
three years, even for the CSS types; (b) re-employment of even the 
exceptionally indispensable ones, (c) all promotions for a period 
of three to four years. In addition, perks and privileges of senior 
bureaucrats should be cut down to national proportions. If all 
facilities like vehicle, servant, telephone, house, etc., are 
translated into money and given in the form of cash, the saving to 
the exchequer will be tremendous. In any case, the money that will 
be saved to the nation as a result of this permanent watch over the 
activity of senior government servants will far outweigh the 
expenditure on the inspection wings.
    
Of course, most of the present organs performing (and miserably 
failing in) these functions should be abolished as soon as the 
inspection wings come into existence. Not only should the highly 
bloated anti-corruption departments be disbanded, along with the 
so-called Prime Ministers and Chief Ministers Inspection Teams, 
even the FIA and similar organisations which are used more for 
terrorising than for any positive accountability will have to go.
    
Experience has shown that the larger the number of organisations 
for the same purpose the greater the confusion and the lesser their 
achievement. Instead, let us have just one decent organisation for 
accountability, headed, not by the executive, as at present, but by 
that other pillar of the state, the judiciary. We owe it to the 
wronged people of this country.

<a name="thep">The principles the Quaid stood for</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Imtiaz Rafi Butt

TODAY, the country is again in the midst of political and economic 
turmoil and, more so, a moral crisis. There is talk of corruption 
in high places and a universal clamour for accountability. A 
caretaker government is in the saddle and striving hard to put the 
house in order within the short interval at its disposal. A 
Herculean task, indeed.
    
The caretaker prime minister, in one of his recent addresses, 
bemoaned that the nation would not have come to such a pass had the 
rulers not strayed away from the path prescribed by the Quaid. He 
urged the people to recapture the spirit of the forties and work 
with a new passion to translate the Quaids dream into reality. 
Excellent sentiments. But the question is how much longer will the 
nation have to wait before the expectations of the Quaid are 
fulfilled.
    
The fact is that soon after the demise of the Quaid, the rulers set 
aside his precious legacy and embarked on a reckless course that 
pushed the country time and again onto the verge of disaster. They 
forgot the sacrifices that the Quaid and his band of heroic 
followers had made to wrest a separate homeland for the Muslims 
from a xenophobic Hindu majority and an arrogant British imperial 
power. The tragedy of Pakistan, writes Saad Khairi, is that 
while surviving all the problems of Himalayan dimensions, it was 
then hijacked by a gang which neither represented the people nor 
shared the spirit of the Pakistan movement.
    
Ghulam Mohammad, Iskander Mirza, Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Zia-ul-Haq 
who would have normally retired as government pensioners captured 
power and ruled the country as a colony as the British did. They 
had never fought even a single municipal election and lived in 
their own world totally cut off from the common man. They neither 
understood nor cared for popular sentiments.... They mentioned 
Jinnahs name merely as a cover for their destructive policies to 
trample under foot every principle that he held dear.
    
What were the principles dear to the Quaid? What sort of a socio-
political framework did he envisage for the new state of Pakistan? 
The Quaid was of the view that the social system of Pakistan should 
be built on civilised values, a democratic culture, time-honoured 
judicial traditions and on a modern industrial and non-feudal 
agricultural base. A social system founded on co-operation rather 
than contention that would lead to harmony, discipline, self-
reliance, freedom from exploitation, and enable Pakistan to find 
its rightful place in the fraternity of nations.
    
The Quaid-i-Azam was a man of few words, a brilliant constitutional 
lawyer and a great civil libertarian always outspoken in defence of 
individual rights and equal justice. Sir, he insisted on behalf 
of the editor of the Bombay Chronicle, B.G. Horniman: I do 
maintain, and I have drunk deep at the fountain of constitutional 
law, that the liberty of man is the dearest thing in the law of any 
constitution and it should not be taken away in this fashion.
    
These words were uttered in 1924. Twenty-three years later he was 
to be elected unanimously to preside over the meeting of Pakistans 
Constituent Assembly. Addressing the august house on August 11, 
1947 he said: ... the first duty of a government is to maintain 
law and order, so that the life, property and religious beliefs of 
its subjects are fully protected by the state .... One of the 
biggest curses from which India is suffering is bribery and 
corruption. That really is a poison. We must put it down with an 
iron hand. The next thing that strikes me is ... the evil of 
nepotism and jobbery. This evil must be crushed relentlessly. I 
want to make it clear that I shall never tolerate any kind of 
jobbery, nepotism or any influence directly or indirectly to bear 
upon me.
    
Earlier in April 1943, the Quaid had given expression to his views 
on social justice and economic equality. Here I should like to 
give a warning to the landlords and capitalists. The exploitation 
of the masses has gone into their blood. They have forgotten the 
lesson of Islam .... Do you visualise that millions have been 
exploited and cannot get one meal a day? If this is the idea of 
Pakistan, I would not have it. If they are wise they will have to 
adjust themselves to the new conditions of life. If they dont, God 
help them, we shall not help them.
    
The Quaid had a clear conception of the lines on which he wished to 
build Pakistan. But, sad to say, he died early  in 1948, barely a 
year after the creation of Pakistan. But within those twelve hectic 
months he compressed the energies of a life-time and left behind a 
comprehensive blueprint for the future guidance of the nation. Had 
he lived for ten more years, he would have transformed and 
institutionalised the spirit of the Pakistan movement and given a 
proper start to the democratic process.
    
It is a pity that even after a lapse of fifty years we have not 
been able to redeem the pledge we made to the Quaid. On the 
contrary, every successive government has either pushed the Quaid-
i-Azam into the background or altered his image to suit its own 
questionable ends. Every year loud tributes are paid to his memory 
but the spark of sincerity is missing; the true meaning and purpose 
of his mission is glossed over. Portraits of the Quaid adorn 
lacquered walls of many a public and private establishment but do 
they in any significant sense signify loyalty to the Quaids 
ideals?
    
The Quaid had espoused democracy; we ushered in a reign of civil 
oligarchy and military dictatorship. He had warned us against the 
evils of corruption, nepotism and jobbery; we took to these with 
unbounded exuberance. He had enjoined economic justice; we 
succumbed to mercenary motives and created a horrendous gulf 
between the haves and the have nots.
    
The Quaid was a man of great integrity. Even his enemies could not 
fault him on this account. When Lord Reading, Viceroy of India, 
offered to include the Quaids name on the coveted list of persons 
he was recommending for knighthood, the Quaid declined the offer 
and replied: I prefer to be plain Mr Jinnah. I have lived as plain 
Mr Jinnah and I hope to die as plain Mr Jinnah. Character to him 
was of the very essence and he defined it thus:  The highest sense 
of honour, the highest sense of integrity, conviction, 
incorruptibility, readiness at any time to efface oneself for the 
collective good of the nation.:
    
Now that Pakistan is on the threshold of its golden jubilee and 
poised to enter upon a new phase in its political life, it is 
important for us to redeem our pledge and make the ideals of the 
great Quaid the corner-stone of our socio-economic and political 
edifice. We must rekindle the old fire and reaffirm our faith in 
egalitarian and democratic institutions. The Quaid himself was 
firmly committed to democratic principles.
    
Addressing the Sibi Darbar in February 1948, he said: I have had 
one underlying principle in mind, the principle of Muslim 
democracy. It is my belief that our salvation lies in following the 
golden rules of conduct set for us by our great law-giver, the 
Prophet of Islam. Let us lay the foundation of our democracy on the 
basis of truly Islamic ideals and principles. Our Almighty has 
taught us that our decisions in the affairs of the State will be 
guided by discussions and consultations.
    
Democracy and Pakistan are inseparable. Democracy is indispensable 
for the stability and progress of the country. Should democracy, 
God forbid, suffer a serious setback, the future of the country 
would be greatly imperilled.
    
The coming year promises a wind of change in our political life. 
Elections are in the offing. The process of accountability is 
gaining momentum. New faces animated with a new zeal and resolve 
are likely to appear on the political horizon. One hopes that the 
new leadership will not display the brazen indifference of its 
predecessors and ensure that the ideology of Pakistan and the 
perceptions of the Quaid find the place that they rightly deserve.
    
Democracy, rule of law, human rights, equality and fraternity  
these are what the Quaid-i-Azam stood for and wanted Pakistan to 
embody these enduring values. Thus alone, he believed, could 
Pakistan fulfil its destiny. The whole world, said the Quaid, is 
wondering at the unprecedented cyclonic revolution which has 
brought about the plan of creating and establishing two independent 
sovereign dominions in the sub-continent. As it is, it has been 
unprecedented; there is no parallel in the history of the world.
    
Nirad Chaudhuri, a fierce opponent of partition and by no means a 
friendly critic writes: Jinnah was the only man who came out with 
success and honour from the ignoble end of the British empire in 
India. He never made a secret of what he wanted, never 
prevaricated, never compromised and yet succeeded in inflicting an 
unmitigated defeat on both the British government and the Indian 
National Congress. I salute Jinnah as an honest and honourable 
enemy and acknowledge his greatness.
    
During his brief stewardship of the new state, the Quaid-i-Azam set 
up some exceedingly sound and healthy precedents  the ones that 
could have, in course of time, developed into strong traditions. If 
the lead given by the Quaid had been faithfully followed, many of 
the ills and crises that have afflicted Pakistan after his death 
would have been avoided. But will the nation rise to the occasion 
even now? Will it respond to the call of the hour? Only time will 
tell.

<a name="plan">Plan for comprehensive junior squash coaching unfolded</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 24: The Pakistan Squash Federation (PSF) on Tuesday 
announced a comprehensive junior coaching programme termed as the 
remedial step to reduce the existing gap between Jansher Khan and 
other Pakistani players in the world ranking.
    
The two-phased scheme will be carried out at Peshawar and Karachi. 
Top youngsters within the age group of 19 years will be invited to 
these `coaching clinics initially being set up for a period of one 
year.
    
A Press conference to announce the scheme was addressed by Air 
Marshal Aliuddin, Senior Vice President, PSF, Jansher Khan, Qamar 
Zaman, Mohibullah Khan and Sq. Ldr Fazal, secretary PSF here at 
Chaklala PAF base.
    
At the beginning the Air Marshal informed the Press that the 
President of Pakistan has awarded Jansher Khan Rs. 0.2 million as a 
token of appreciation on winning the World Open title for the 
eighth consecutive time. It was stated that the President will 
present the cheque to the stalwart. AM Aliuddin on behalf of  PSF 
congratulated Jansher Khan on the unprecedented feat and prayed 
that the world number one would go on winning for many more years. 
At least for the next three to four years as Jansher himself says 
and if he is not tired then perhaps he can continue a little 
further than that, he said.
    
Talking about the junior scheme, the Air Marshal said that over 
the past few years PSF has been consistently presenting programmes 
to groom youngsters with the basic aim to get a  successor to 
Jansher Khan. Efforts have been launched through PIA colts, 
international tournament in Pakistan which helped to expose 60-70 
potential youth. Besides there had been concentrated efforts to 
prepare teams. More boys have been picked and tested through 
divisional recommendations etc., he said, but added that the 
forthcoming scheme has one basic difference. It will be run under 
the supervision of top notch professionals.
    
AM Aliuddin said that PSF has held dialogue with top professionals 
trying to find a way to reduce the huge gap existing between 
Jansher Khan and other Pakistani players. Finally, the programme 
which is the brainchild of Jansher, Qamar Zaman and Mohib is being 
launched from December 28th at Peshawar.

Named as Jansher Coaching Clinic, the programme initially will 
continue for one year. Mohibullah will be the senior coach while 
Qamar Zaman will be the manager. Farrukh Zaman and Liaquat Khan are 
the other coaches. For the first time in Pakistan coaches will paid 
for their services, it was said.
    
The Air Marshal, later, admitted that although a number of junior 
programmes were initiated there was no direct involvement of the 
professionals.
    
Top seven juniors have been selected to attend the coaching clinic 
which includes Amjad Khan, Kashif Shuja, Muhammad Hussain, Mansoor 
Zaman, Shahid Zaman and Shahzad Mohib.
    
These youngster are in such an age group where they require 
scientific coaching under professional trainers and we strongly  
hope that with proper training these future worldbeaters should 
burst into action within a period of one year, AM Aliuddin said.
    
The grooming programme includes morning physical training, four to 
five hours of evening game besides learning through audio-visual 
aid once in a week.
    
The monitoring of the programme will be carried out every three 
months. Those failing to achieve the target, whether player 
or official, will be removed and replacements will be made.

<a name="afri">Afridi, Mushtaq rescue Pakistan with lusty hitting</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

HOBART (Australia), Dec 19: Teenager Shahid Afridi slammed 80 off 
62 balls to rescue Pakistan from a mediocre first innings total on 
the opening day of their four-day match with Tasmania here 
Thursday.
    
The 19-year-old right-hander and legspinner Mushtaq Ahmed (65) 
helped Pakistan fight back from 110 for six to be all out for 299 
off 72.3 overs. In reply, Tasmania were 73 for one at the close at 
the Bellerive Oval, with Jamie Cox on 39 and nightwatchman Daniel 
Marsh two.
    
All-rounder Shaun Young upset Pakistans hopes of a sizeable first 
innings total by taking career best first-class figures of 7-64 to 
become the states leading first-class wicket-taker. Afridi, whose 
102 off 37 balls against Sri Lanka on October 4 was the fastest in 
limited-over internationals, clubbed 11 fours and one six before he 
was caught by Ricky Ponting at mid-wicket off spinner Mark Hatton. 
He had been dropped by Young at first slip on 45.
    
After winning the toss, Pakistan surprised by opening the innings 
with leading off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq, but he made only 10 off 
51 balls before he was trapped lbw in Youngs second over. Young 
snared the experienced Ijaz Ahmed with his next delivery, edging to 
Ponting at third slip for a duck. Young missed the hat-trick, but 
in his fifth over he struck again when he caught and bowled 
Inzamam-ul-Haq for seven. Mushtaqs innings ended when he became 
Youngs seventh victim, caught on the off-side by Cox. Young 
exceeded his previous first-class best of 5-36, also achieved 
against Pakistan in Devonport, Tasmania, in 1991-92. He also became 
Tasmanias leading wicket-taker with 147 in a performance that was 
the best seen on the island since 1983-84 when Peter Clough took 8-
95 against Western Australia.
    
Pakistan struck back shortly before stumps, claiming the wicket of 
opener Dene Hills, who was caught by Mohammad Zahid at wide mid-on 
off Mushtaq.AFP.
