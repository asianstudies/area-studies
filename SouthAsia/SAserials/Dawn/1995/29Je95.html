<a name="teen">MQM activist's teenaged sister 'gang-raped'</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June, 22: Mother of an underground Mohajir Qaumi Movement 
worker claimed that her 16-year-old college-going daughter was gang-
raped allegedly by the activists of Peoples Party and MQM Haqiqi during 
an attack on her Gharibabad residence on late Tuesday night.

Shortly after party's women wing chief Shamim Khalil read out a written 
statement at a Press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Thursday 
night, 50-year-old Rashida Begum gave details of the attack which, she 
said, occurred on the night of June 20.

She claimed that over a dozen armed men raided her house, raped her 
daughter and took away cash and gold ornaments worth hundreds of 
thousands of rupees.

The alleged victim was also produced before the journalists. She was 
constantly sobbing, crying and being consoled by other women.

Meanwhile, MQM workers kept a mobile phone line open for an unidentified 
person, believed to be a top MQM leader, who listened to the entire 
Press conference. The entire proceedings were videotaped by MQM men.

"We were asleep when they sneaked into our house. Four of them took 
position atop the roof.

Three others were outside. They asked us about the whereabouts of Shahid 
Feroze. They started manhandling me, my two sons, a daughter-in-law and 
my daughter, when we were unable to give them any information," she 
said.

"First they threatened to kill my two infant grand-children. Then they 
threatened to dishonour my daughter, Farzana. They took her into another 
room and did what they had threatened to do. We pleaded them not to do 
this but they did not listen to us," she said.

"They came at midnight and left the house at 3 am. In the morning we 
took Farzana to a private hospital in New Karachi for treatment. I did 
not go to the police station because I feared the Haqiqi and Peoples 
Party men would kill all my family members," she said.

"At the time of the attack, my husband was in an adjacent house. When 
some neighbours tried to intervene, the armed men stationed on rooftop 
and outside the main entrance, turned them away," she said.

"They blind-folded one of my married sons and ordered him to keep lying 
on the floor. His 15 year-old brother was asked to do likewise," she 
said.

According to the affected family, the victim has identified some of the 
accused who, she says, live in the same neighbourhood.

MQM women's wing chief Shamim Khalil blamed Peoples Party councillor 
Naeem Qureshi, a member of KMC advisory council, his son, two nephews 
and some Haqiqi workers for the rape.

"They came in three government vehicles and fled the house while 
shouting Jiye Bhutto slogans. They left the house like conquerors," she 
said.

She said the family kept quiet for a day and discussed the incident with 
family elders whether to make it public. "As it was a very sensitive 
issue and the honour of other Mohajir women too could be at stake, the 
family decided to come out in the public," she added.

the alleged rape of Farzana Feroz, sister of an Altaf group activist, 
Shahid Feroz. The inquiry will be conducted by a Judge of Sindh High 
Court.

Meanwhile, MQM MPA Shoaib Bokhari, along with the victim of the alleged 
incident, lodged an FIR with the police here on Friday evening.

Mr Shoaib M Bokhari, lodged the FIR with the Sharifabad police on Friday 
evening under Hudood Ordinance.

The complainant, lodged Farzana, has named eight persons as culprits.

They include Ayub, son of Naeem Qureshi; Bhura, son of Naeem Qureshi; 
Munna Dacoit, son of Naeem Qureshi; Sudhir alias Bholoo, Naeem, Ghias, 
Iqbal and an unknown son of Naeem Qureshi.

<a name="call">MQM calls for 3-day mourning</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 23: The Mohajir Qaumi Movement Coordination Committee 
appealed to the people on Friday to observe peaceful mourning on 
Saturday, Sunday and Monday over the gang rape incident of Tuesday last.

In a statement, the committee asked the people to wear black armbands, 
close business, refrain from brining transport on roads and express 
solidarity with Farzana Sultan, the victim of sexual barbarism.

The committee said the government had not yet arrested the alleged 
culprits, Naeem Qureshi, his sons Bhoora and Muna Dakait, and his two 
nephews Nadim Ghias Sudhir alias Bholoo and Iqbal, involved in the 
incident.

The committee alleged that the main culprit was hiding in Islamabad.

<a name="toob">MQM to observe protest on Fridays, Saturdays  </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 26: The Mohajir Qaumi Movement coordination committee' 
which gave a 48-hour ultimatum on Saturday evening in support of its 
six-point demands on Monday, announced observance of a two-day weekly 
closure till the acceptance of its demands.

According to a statement released by the committee, the first protest 
closure will be observed on Friday (June 30) and Saturday (July 1).

The committee said the new line of action had been adopted after a 
thorough discussion and mutual consultations by the MQM legislators and 
the coordination committee members.

"The MQM has not opted for an indefinite closure, firstly, because it 
wants to give more time to the government to reconsider its demands and 
show a positive attitude, and secondly, it wants to make it clear to 
democratic countries and human rights organisations that the MQM does 
not believe in rigidity," the committee said.

It said despite the "objectionable remarks by the prime minister against 
the Mohajirs, the MQM had suspended its protest drive for an indefinite 
period as a gesture of goodwill.

"This proves that the MQM believes in democratic norms and a process of 
mutual understanding for getting issues resolved," the committee added.

It said despite the continuing genocide and rape incidents, the MQM had 
decided to confine its protest to two days a week.

The committee demanded of the government to stop genocide of the 
Mohajirs, accept MQM's genuine demands and solve the problems through a 
peaceful process of dialogues rather than using brute state force 
against the party.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 27: Hashimuz Zafar for whose release MQM had given a 48-
hour ultimatum to the government at a press conference, held at the PID 
press centre on Tuesday, claimed that the MQM wanted to create a general 
desperation where the people of Karachi would be left with no other 
option but to support the demand of a separate province.

"The present spate of terrorism will continue till March 1996 when the 
MQM has planned to put forth the demand of holding a referendum on the 
issue of a separate province," he alleges.

"If the government does not accept the demand for a referendum, the MQM 
would raise the issue at the international level and project it as a 
denial of the right of self-determination for creating a parity- between 
Karachi and Kashmir," he said.

Hashimuz Zafar in this regard referred to an open letter of Altaf 
Hussain of 1994 in which he had reportedly hinted that "agencies" wanted 
to create Sindhu Desh and greater Punjab and make Karachi a satellite 
state of a greater Punjab.

Obviously such a situation would not be acceptable to the people of 
Karachi and they would prefer independence rather than becoming a 
satellite state of a greater Punjab, he said.

Given the geographic importance of Karachi, Western and regional powers 
would willingly throw their weight behind the demand and force a 
solution of both the Kashmir and Karachi issues, he added.

Zafar accused a former minister and brother of a serving general 
Chaudhry Nisar Ali, for leaking details of the army operation in Sindh 
to Altaf Hussain.

He also alleged that leaders of the ANP in Karachi had been supplying 
arms to the MQM. He also named some PML MNAs from Karachi as the 
financiers of the MQM.

Zafar seemed well prepared for the press conference. He had notes with 
him and in a very systematic way he not only gave details of his crimes 
but also briefed a hostile press about the MQM's operational mechanism, 
its alleged Indian connections, strategy and ultimate goals.

He was very confident and conducted the press conference like a seasoned 
media manager. He also gave full details about eight terrorist groups 
and their area of operation at present active in Karachi.

Hashimuz Zafar, 25, and resident of house No C-17 Sir Syed Town, North 
Karachi, said he had joined the All Pakistan Muhajir Students 
Organisation at the age of 17 when he was studying in Government College 
of Technology.

He confessed to involvement in numerous crimes, including the murder of 
MQM Chairman Azim Ahmed Tariq.

The organisational set-up of the MQM, which comprised units, sectors, 
zones and main centre at Nine-Zero, he said, was disbanded before the 
military operation.

Now an underground information centre was maintaining a link with 22 
different sectors. Some time Altaf Hussain, through Nadeem Nusrat, 
issues orders to the sectors-in-charge for carrying out different 
operations on mobile phones. Pagers were also being used to maintain a 
link and convey messages, he said.

"The sector in charge of Landhi, Amir Siddique, and the sector in charge 
of Malir, Qamar Ghalib, are currently manning the information centre," 
he claimed.

Giving details of various groups active at the sector level, he said the 
Khalid Taqi Butt group was active in the old city area, Liaquatabad, 
Lines Area, Society, Clifton, Defence and PIB Colony. The Farooq Dad 
group was operating in Pak Colony, Baldia Town, Nazimabad, and Gulbahar.

The Faheem Commando group is active in Federal B. Area, North Karachi 
and Nazimabad.

Tahir Rafi, Arif Qureshi, Khuram and 10 other boys were the members of 
the Mubeen Thunta group controlling the Malir and Model Town areas. Then 
there were other groups, like those headed by Javed Khan, Javed Michael, 
Asfar, Khaliq Anjum, Kamal Ansari alias Par, and Muhammad Shahid.

The MQM, he said, was regularly maintaining a hit list which was update 
>from  time to time. Names of the members of MQM Haqiqi political rivals, 
defectors and known police officers were on this list. Altaf Hussain, he 
said, personally checked this but list and gave approval.

However, a source disclosed that the programme of press conferences 
would continue for quite some time as a number of MQM "activists" had 
been arrested in Islamabad during the last one month. One by one all of 
these would be presented before the press and electronic media.

<a name="extr">Extradition of Altaf sought, says Babar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By A Correspondent

KARACHI, June 28: The government formally confirmed here on Wednesday 
that it had issued "red warrant" through Interpol to seek arrest and 
return of Altaf Hussain to Pakistan from the United Kingdom for 
"involvement" in acts of terrorism in the city.

Talking to newsman at the State Guest House, Federal Interior minister 
Naseerullah Babar told newsmen that the step had been taken in the light 
evidence and because Pakistan not have extradition treaty with the 
United Kingdom.  

"It is incumbent upon police forces of various countries who are members 
of Interpol to arrest him (Altaf) and return him to the place of crime," 
Babar said, adding that "the Foreign Office would take parallel measures 
with the British government in this regard."

The decision to seek Interpol's assistance was taken late Tuesday at a 
time when Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto announced setting up of a 
committee for opening a dialogue with MQM leaders who were not involved 
in terrorism. The offer was rejected by the Rabita Committee of the MQM.  

Babar said the MQM leader, who went into self-exile just before the army 
operation in 1992, was a "proclaimed offender" and the government's 
decision to seek Interpol's assistance was a "normal process".

He said Altaf Hussain's reported statement that he could go beyond the 
demand of a separate province for Mohajirs if the MQM demands were not 
met was an indication as to what he had up his sleeves.

The government was interpreting the reported statement as an indication 
of separatist designs but the MQM supporters did not consider it to be 
against the integrity of  Pakistan.

The MQM founding leader is alleged to be involved in about 100 cases, 
including murders and inciting violence. He has already been sentenced 
to 27 years imprisonment in absentia in two cases of kidnapping and 
torture of an army official.  

Keeping the opinion of dialogue open, Babar said, "if Altaf Hussain 
strikes withdraws call for renounce violence, ask his activists to 
surrender arms and stop violence, then some one will be sent for talks 
with him!"

He emphasised that Mr Hussain should return to Pakistan and face charges 
against him in the courts as was done by Mir Murtaza Bhutto the 
estranged brother of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

He said the government would not withdraw cases registered against 
anyone and would take action against activists of Al-Zulfikar, MQM or 
Jeay Sindh movement, if they violated law and were found involved in 
criminal acts.

By Ghulam Hasnain

KARACHI, June 23: Twenty-four people were killed and several others 
wounded in targeted attacks, sniping and gunbattles between rangers, 
police and armed youths on Friday, raising the month's death toll to 
204.

Among the dead were a central leader of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, S. 
M. Tariq, who was gunned down near his Federal B. Area residence, and an 
unidentified woman.

Ten people were killed in Korangi alone, where hundreds of rangers and 
police fought pitched battles with armed youths for several hours. But 
most of the dead were innocent people caught in the cross fire.

Eleven people including an MQM leader, were killed in District Central!

S. M. Tariq, 36, the party's former central finance secretary and 
brother of an ex-MNA, S.M. Aslam, was gunned down near his Federal B. 
Area house in the late afternoon.

As soon as the MQM leader came out of his residence in a car, he was 
intercepted by armed men, riding a car, who sprayed him with bullets. He 
received over a dozen wounds and died instantly.

Javed, a pedestrian, who was wounded in the attack, died in the Abbasi 
Shaheed Hospital a couple of hours later.

<a name="clai">Violence claims 20 lives in city</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ghulam Hasnain

KARACHI, June 24: Twenty people were killed and many others wounded as 
widespread violence paralysed the city on Saturday amid chaos and 
confusion in the ranks of police and rangers.

Two policemen, two MQM workers, two truck drivers, a PPP activist, and a 
police informer were among those who fell victim to the shooting spree.

The day-long violence, on the first day of the three-day mourning being 
observed by the Mohajir Qaumi Movement over the alleged gang rape of a 
college student, forced the cancellation of examinations, closure of 
shops, markets, business and commercial centres. The absence of public 
transport and shortage of staff hampered industrial activities reduced 
port operations and affected PIA's domestic flights.

Unidentified men attacked a newspaper office with a rocket propelled 
grenade, set on fire a passenger train, ransacked and destroyed over a 
dozen public and private vehicles, set ablaze two bank branches, a 
Pakistan Telecommunication's customer service centre,  a petrol pump, 
and some shops.

Several parts of the city were under the control of armed youths as 
police and rangers were not deployed early in the morning.

The newly-appointed chief of the city police, Dr Shoaib Suddle, was not 
available for comment on why effective security steps were not taken.

A 20-year-old MQM activist was killed and another wounded in a shootout 
with police in Ferozabad. Police claimed that the victim was trying to 
set on fire a private car when he was challenged by the police.

Another MQM worker was kidnapped and killed in Orangi Town. The MQM 
claimed that Mohammad Mateen, 28, a vegetable vendor, was allegedly 
kidnapped by PPP activists from his house and later his body, with 
bullet wounds and signs of torture, was thrown in a nearby area.

By Ghulam Hasnain

KARACHI, June 25: At least 32 people lost their lives and many others 
were wounded as the city witnessed one of the worst days of violence on 
Sunday, marked by several rocket and grenade attacks.  

A C-130 of Pakistan Air Force was sprayed with bullets while landing at 
the Shahra-e- Faisal base on Saturday. PAF officials detected at least 
seven bullet marks on the tail of the transport plane on Sunday.  

A PAF spokesman, talking to Dawn by telephone from Islamabad on Sunday, 
however said that the aircraft was not targeted but was hit by bullets 
owing to indiscriminate shooting in the area near the base.

All the shops and markets, commercial and business centres remained 
closed on the second day of the three-day mourning being observed by the 
Mohajir Qaumi Movement over alleged gang-rape of a college student and 
assassination of the party's leader.

Unidentified men carried out rocket attacks against police and rangers, 
fired rockets at police stations, engaged members of the law enforcement 
agencies in gunbattles in various parts of the city and destroyed public 
and private property.

The two explosions, followed by heavy shooting, created a scare in the 
entire area and the neighbours claimed that the rocket explosion r at t 
led the windowpanes in the radius of one kilometre.

A new dimension was added to the ongoing kidnapping and killings of 
political opponents when police found at least nine bullet-riddled 
bodies with hands and legs tied, on major city roads and in streets.

Some of the residents of the areas where  these bodies were found, 
accused police and rangers of dumping them there while officials said it 
was a result of infighting between the rival groups of Mohajir Qaumi 
Movement.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ghulam Hasnain

KARACHI, June 26: On Monday, the third and last day of mourning observed 
by the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, 23 people were killed and many others 
wounded in the city which remained in the grip of armed youths.

An unprecedented wave of fear swept the city following anonymous calls 
to offices, banks and other establishments, telling them to shot down 
all businesses by 4 pm on Monday.

Long before the deadline, thousands of panicky employees, including 
those of multinationals, hurried back home.  

The uncertainty was over when the MQM announced an end to its mourning 
but decided that two days a week (Fridays and Saturdays) would be 
observed as protest days until the government accepted its six-point 
demand.

Violence dealt a severe blow to industrial production, commercial and 
business activities and kept the Karachi Stock Exchange closed for the 
second consecutive day.

The four days of continuous violence which claimed over 100 lives and 
huge losses to public and private property created acute shortages of 
edibles, consumer goods not only in localities where complete closure 
was observed but in other areas of the metropolis as well.

Arsonists set on fire at least six houses owned by their rivals in 
Orangi, two KMC offices, a councillor's office, a bank branch, a utility 
store, and a showroom,  and attacked the offices of Board of Secondary 
Education in Nazimabad and set ablaze five staff vehicles parked there.

Rangers and police exchanged fire with the youths in parts of the city 
but were unable to maintain law and order there as the heavily armed 
youths kept them out of the troubled localities.

The mysterious killing and kidnapping of Balochis and Sindhis and 
Pukhtoons in district West sparked off ethnic tension followed by heavy 
shooting.

Police found the bodies of five young unidentified labourers, who were 
kidnapped, tortured and later their bodies were abandoned in Saeedabad. 
All the bodies were stuffed in sacks. Police said they seemed to be 
labourers. Their legs and hands were also tied.

Till the filing of this report only three of them were identified as 
Asif, Aijaz and Haq Nawaz. Two of them were brothers. They were 
residents of Mansehra Colony of Saeedabad.

Two Baloch youths were kidnapped in Orangi Town and their bodies were 
dumped in Orangi Extension. The incident sparked off ethnic violence in 
the area.

KARACHI, June 27: Fourteen people were killed on Tuesday as the city 
tried to limp back to normality after three days of "mourning" observed 
by the MQM.

Clashes during the last few days allegedly between the supporters of 
Mohajir Qaumi Movement and the People's Party took an ethnic turn in 
parts of the city due to the mysterious killings of members of Pakhtoon, 
Punjabi and Baloch communities.

Rival ethnic groups drug trenches and in the heavy gunbattle took place 
two MQM workers were killed. The MQM claimed that two of its workers, 
Faqir Mohammad, 30, and Mohammad Tahir, 20, were gunned down by the 
ruling party activists.

Violence erupted in Orangi Town in the morning when some People's Party 
activists of Baloch Goth forced some Urdu-speaking shopkeepers to pull 
down their shutters in protest against the kidnapping and killing of two 
Baloch youths-Nawab, 20, and Ghafoor, 25,-on Monday.

Soon after, members of both the communities took positions atop the 
roofs of their houses and exchanged heavy gunfire.

Baloch Goth residents claimed that the rangers, who came following their 
appeal for help, mysteriously left the area a few minutes later. "We 
contacted the government advisers. Nobody is coming to our rescue. They 
incited the Baloch youths against the Mohajirs but now, when our 
localities are being attacked, we are not being provided any help by the 
government," a resident said.

The kidnapping and killing of five Pakhtoon and Hindko speaking youths 
in Saeedabad on Monday triggered ethnic tension there on Tuesday.

According to police reports, the Mohajirs and Hindko-speaking people 
>from  Hazara, exchanged fire.

"The rangers have been rushed to contain the violence. But intermittent 
firing is still going on," said a police officer of the troubled area.

<a name="moha">Mohal warns CM against joining hands with PML</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, June 24: Punjab Assembly Deputy Speaker and PML(J) leader 
Manzoor Mohal warned on Saturday that in case Chief Minister Manzoor 
Wattoo tried to join hands with the PML(N) he with 16 PML(J) MPAs and 
some independents would revolt and start supporting the PPP.

"We are opposed to the PML(N) They are a rival faction. We cannot 
tolerate PML(J) cooperating with them", he said at a news conference at 
the Punjab Assembly chambers. However, he did not say what would be his 
line of action in case the PPP dislodged Mr Wattoo with its own efforts.

Chief Minister Wattoo was quoted as saying on Saturday that contacts 
between the PML(J) and the PML(N) would have a positive impact on 
national politics.

Political circles here interpreted this as a distinct hint by the chief 
minister that a reunion of the two PML factions which had separated in 
April 1993 was a possibility.

Mr Mohal, who is the MPA for Bahawalnagar, said he wanted to see the PDF 
work smoothly and complete its five-year term.

He rejected as baseless the opposition's allegation that he was a 
political turncoat. He claimed that he had always stood by his 
principles.

He admitted that he had joined the PPP and then left it, but clarified 
that he had not done this out of any consideration for material or any 
other gain.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 24: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said on Saturday: "We 
will talk to the British government as to how Altaf Hussain is using 
their territory for inciting an armed insurgency in Karachi. "She was 
commenting on a reported  interview-of the MQM leader with Voice of 
Germany.

She told newsmen: "I have not seen any such interview but if these 
reports are true then we will talk to the British government".
She immediately directed her Press assistant to get a transcript of that 
interview.

However, Ms Bhutto said :" We will continue to seek a political solution 
to Karachi's problems but the Altaf group will have to lay down arms 
first, surrender all proclaimed offenders and condemn terrorism.

"MQM must realise that they could not get their demands fulfilled 
through bloodshed", she added.

She condemned the murder of S.M. Tariq. "He was a brave so of Karachi 
who renounced fascism and refused to go along with Altaf Hussain," she 
said.

Ms Bhutto linked the gang- rape of Farzana Feroze to the factional 
fighting between the Altaf group and the Haqiqi group. The government, 
she added, had already ordered a judicial inquiry to bring facts before 
the nation.

<a name="maul">Maulana Tariq surrenders</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  A Correspondent

PESHAWAR, June 25: Maulana Azam Tariq, central leader of Sipah-i-Sihaba 
Pakistan (SSP) and leader of the Muttahida Deeni Mahaz's parliamentary 
party in the National Assembly, surrendered to the NWFP authorities here 
on Sunday.

Earlier, addressing a Press conference at the Peshawar Press Club 
Maulana Tariq gave his reasons for going into hiding for the last few 
months.

The MNA from Jhang revealed that he had gone underground on February 22 
before police raided his residence in the wake of the government's 
action against religious educational institutions. He said that he had 
avoided arrest because it might have aggravated the law and order in the 
country and hurt the religious sentiments of the people.

Rejecting the allegation of SSP's involvement in terrorist activities, 
the Maulana said his opponents had launched a smear campaign against him 
and his party to hinder their just struggle to protect Islam. He claimed 
that his party did not believe in armed struggle and it preferred to 
settle issues through dialogue.

Maulana Tariq expressed full confidence in the judiciary and said he was 
ready to face all cases registered against him.

However, he termed the cases baseless and mala fide, adding that, in a 
couple of cases, even the main accused had been released after 
undergoing six months imprisonment but he was still wanted by police, 
although his name had been mentioned in the FIRs as a coaccused. 
Replying to a question, he expressed ignorance about the number of cases 
registered against him.

<a name="expe">Experts being invited to help fight terrorism  </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, June 26: Experts on urban terrorism from France and Turkey 
are being in which by the government to combat MQM insurgency in 
Karachi, Interior Minister Gen.(Retd) Naseerullah Babar told National 
Assembly on Monday.

Babar who was replying to questions on the Karachi situation said that 
Turkey had vast experience in fighting urban terrorism and therefore the 
government has decided to acquire experts from there.

The interior minister in his answer conceded that the situation in 
Karachi was very serious but denied that the government was going to 
call out army.

"We have no intentions to call out army", he said while adding that it 
was the objective of "our" enemies to bog down Pakistan Army in Karachi. 
They want to divert Pakistan Army from their prime task of defending the 
geographical frontiers of the country, he said. 

Babar while opposing the idea of sending troops in Karachi said that 
even the army had not achieved very tangible results in controlling the 
situation during the two and half years long operation.

He blamed the opposition for encouraging Altaf Hussain and his 
terrorism. He said the opposition's plan to convene an All Parties 
Conference on Karachi issue was giving moral support to Altaf Hussain.

He called upon the opposition to condemn violence and terrorism and 
completely isolate Altaf Hussain.

Regarding the alleged gang-rape of Farzana Feroze he said, it was a base 
less and concocted case. He said the main objective of the whole case 
was to malign and defame the government.

He called upon the members to do some soul-searching and realise whether 
a 68 year old man could resort to such kind of action.

He also disagreed with the idea that more forces should be deployed or 
curfew should be imposed in the city for curbing the surging wave of 
terrorism. He pointed out that the total strength of Karachi police was 
only 20,000 which he said was inadequate to control the situation. He 
said the PPP when came into power in 1988 had increased the strength of 
Karachi Police from l2,000 to 20,000.

The situation in Karachi, he added was a cause of concern.

<a name="chan">Govt changes media managers</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, June 26: In a major reshuffle of the information ministry, 
the government brought back some of the media managers who had 
successfully run the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif government's 
information policy, an official source told Dawn. Controversial 
information secretary, Hussain Haqqani, had been replaced by Haji 
Muhammad Akram, the architect of Mr Sharif's media campaign, and he was 
expected to take charge in the next few days, the source said. Mr 
Haqqani had been made the chairman of House Building Finance 
Corporation.

The managing director of Pakistan Television Corporation, Farhad Zaidi, 
has also been removed and his predecessor, Shahid Rafi, has been brought 
back. Mr Rafi had earned fame for launching and successfully running Mr 
Sharif's image-building flood and rape victim campaigns. (In a later 
development Rana Shaikh wife of the Foreign Secretary Najmuddin Shaikh 
was nominated instead of Shahid Rafi.)

Ishfaq Gondal, the Principal information secretary (PIO), who was 
considered to be close with Mr Haqqani, has also been removed and 
replaced by Anwar Mahmood who was holding the same post during the 
Sharif government.

The portfolio of handling the internal publicity has been given to 
Ismail Patel, the former Press assistant to ex-president Ghulam Ishaq 
Khan, who was presently working as secretary of Environment Protection 
Council held by Asif Ali Zardari.

A PPP official, when contacted by Dawn to seek his comments on the 
sudden changes in the ministry, said the Prime Minister was not happy 
with her media team which, he added, had failed to deliver the goods. He 
said it was for this reason that the government had recently asked a 
newly formed advertising agency to work for its image building. "The 
information secretary had become too big for his boots," he added.

A week earlier, the government had replaced the managing director of 
state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) by bringing Azhar Sohail in 
place of Aslam Sheikh.

"The new team is experienced and we hope that things will improve."

<a name="3ger">3 German engineers kidnapped</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ahmad Hassan

PESHAWAR, June 27: Three German engineers, kidnapped by unknown gunmen 
late on Monday evening, have been taken to a remote tribal area most 
probably Orakzai or Khyber Agency. The German nationals, it may be 
mentioned, were kidnapped in their own vehicle while they were returning 
>from  their work site at a WAPDA grid station on the outskirts of 
Peshawar. Acting Inspector General of Police Sikandar Mohamandzai told 
newsmen on Tuesday that the police had found some clue to the kidnappers 
and recovered the vehicle on borders of Khyber and Orakzai agencies. 
But, he added, the identity of the kidnappers could not be disclosed at 
the stage.

The IGP said Inayatullah, the driver of the vehicle in which the Germans 
had been kidnapped, was one of the culprits. The IGP was of the view 
that the cause of the kidnapping could not be established for the time 
being. Some disgruntled workers at the grid station might have been 
involved in the incident, he said. But, he added, no ransom had so far 
been demanded by the kidnappers. However, he was confident that the 
Germans would be recovered soon.

The Germans, Gunder Mayor, Kohler and Amon Horst, were working at the 
grid station extension project at a village, Sheikh Mohammadi, along 
with other foreign engineers and experts.

Peshawar police have sought the help of political administration of 
Khyber and Orakzai agencies for the recovery of the Germans.

LATEST POSITION: Latest reports say that the kidnappers, including the 
driver, belong to the gang which was involved in a fierce shootout with 
police in Badaber on March 20 last in which four of their men had been 
killed. The Germans, the reports say, have been taken to a remote 
village Hasankhel in the Khyber Agency with the authorities have located 
but are tight-lipped about it.

NWFP Chief Minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao who is concerned over the 
incident, which can jeopardise foreign investment, has held discussions 
with the DIG, headquarters, Sikandar Mohmandzai, and the DIG, Range, 
Fayyaz Khan.

Another report, which could not be confirmed, said that the kidnappers 
had demanded Rs 100 million for the release of the Germans.

<a name="exto">Extortion rampant, HRCP told</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, June 27: Extortion of money by politically sponsored armed youth 
in collusion with police and other law enforcement agencies was an 
allegation levelled by almost all those the Human Rights Commission of 
Pakistan (HRCP) interviewed for a report on the causes of the current 
situation in Karachi.

The report, released to the Press here on Monday (and covered in 
yesterday's issue), is based on a study by a five-member fact-finding 
mission of the HRCP whose members interviewed a cross section of the 
people.

The HRCP was told that Karachi was a hostage mainly to the two MQM 
factions. The MQM (Altaf) held large parts of the city in its control 
while the MQM (Haqiqi) dominated Korangi and the adjoining areas. They 
were not only fighting for domination but also came into conflict over 
extortion of money.  

A group of industrialists and businessmen claimed that about Rs8 million 
was being collected by extortionists every day. Half of the money was 
going to one political faction and the rest was being shared by other 
political groups and the police. "Bhatta" was also being extracted from 
labourers, as claimed by a group of trade union leaders. They said 
marriage ceremonies were being "taxed" by militants. In one area of 
Karachi, the "tax" was Rs 10,000 for a boy's wedding and Rs 5,000 for a 
girl's marriage.

Doctors told the HRCP mission that in-door clinics were forced to pay 
"protection money" in some parts of the city. They conceded that 
hospitals were under instructions of the Sindh home department not to 
admit a sick or injured detainee without permission. Similarly, issuance 
of false medical reports on sick detainees was admitted. "We are 
violating the UN Declaration on the Duties of Physicians to Persons in 
Detention by yielding to the government instructions", the doctors said.

An office-bearer of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association alleged 
that an ethnic group had raised an armed militia of young people who 
were given a monthly salary of about Rs6,000 with a motorcycle and a 
kalashnikov. Members of this force were largely responsible for 
collection of "bhatta" which was not only going to the organisation but 
also being shared with police.

Another matter raised pertained to local elections on which opinion was 
divided. Some supported immediate local elections to take care of the 
deteriorating civic conditions in Karachi. But another opinion was that 
local elections should be held after a census in the city. But both 
sections of opinion feared that the existing conditions were not 
conducive to an electoral exercise. Similarly, they feared, the MQM (A) 
might not behave differently from what it did when it was in control of 
the main city institutions like the KMC, KDA, KESC and the Steel Mills 
during the tenure of the late Jam Sadiq Ali as chief minister. "Karachi 
does not deserve a repetition of what the MQM has done in the past", a 
former president of the Karachi High Court Bar Association said.  Sindh 
Minister for Planning Nisar Khuhro said factional fighting was taking a 
heavy toll. The factions were also extorting money and some were issuing 
receipts for "donations". He said Karachi needed a negotiated 
settlement, but expressed his opinion that the MQM was not trustworthy 
as it had changed its negotiating team every time talks seemed to be 
making some progress.

Prof Ghafoor Ahmad of the Jamaat-i-Islami alleged that all kinds of 
crime like drug trafficking, gun-running, gambling and prostitution were 
on the increase and the government was fully aware of the elements 
behind the criminal acts. He said people were being harassed and 
detainees set at liberty after paying bribes to police and the rangers.

PPP (SB) chairman Mir Murtaza Bhutto told the HRCP mission that the law 
enforcement agencies were patronising gunrunners and drug barons. He 
denied involvement of Al-Zulfiqar in the violence in Karachi. He 
supported talks between the government and political groups, but said he 
was opposed to the MQM demand of a separate province.

MQM (A) leader MPA Shoaib Bokhari and advocate Khalid Qazi said the 
government's victimisation of people for not voting for the PPP in the 
1993 elections and oppression by the administration and law enforcement 
agencies were the reasons mainly responsible for the violence in 
Karachi. "People have been driven to take up arms against these 
excesses" Shoaib Bokhrai said. He said the police were picking up 
relatives of "wanted" people and were taking them to places other than 
police stations where they were tortured. Such cases ran into their 
hundreds, he alleged.

The MQM representatives denied the charges of raising an armed militia 
and paying its members salaries. They also denied that the MQM wanted 
Karachi to be a separate province (Mr Altaf Husain on Monday said this 
was what the Mohajirs of Karachi wished).

MQM (H) leader Afaq Ahmad charged the MQM (A) with acquiring, "with 
foreign help," strength to paralyse the city. He also alleged that the 
MQM (A) had raised an armed militia comprising youth trained in the use 
of arms.

IGP Afzal Shigri admitted that violators of law were paying protection 
money to "patharidars" who in most cases were in league with policemen. 
He said Karachi was facing a situation of mini insurgency where a weak 
police force of 27,000 was working against heavy odds. In his view a 
strength of 70,000 was required to combat violence in Karachi.

The IG gave figures of people killed or injured during the period when 
the army was operating in Sindh (Oct 1993 to Nov 1994) and after it was 
widbdrawn. According to the data, 353 people were killed, including 103 
of MQM (A) and 74 of MQM (H), during the army operation. Ten policemen 
were also killed during the period. The number of those injured during 
the period was 649.

After withdrawal of the army, according to the data, the number of those 
killed rose to 781 and those injured to 1,056. Of them 73 belonged to 
the MQM (A) and 78 to the MQM (H). The number of policemen killed during 
the period was 82 and the number of dead among the rangers and the 
payment was 18. The number of injured policemen was 112, the IG said.

<a name="budg">Budget targets termed over-optimistic</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, June 24: Former minister in the caretaker government of Moin 
Qureshi and Director of Institute of Business Administration, Dr Hafiz 
Pasha on Friday termed the budgetary projections of 1995-96 as over-
optimistic and felt that the credibility of government budgeting was 
very low.

Speaking at a seminar titled 'Effects of the Federal Budget on National 
Economy' he said: "The budget starts with a wrong benchmark" adding that 
the revenue estimate was on a very high side and "there was an over-
optimistic projection."

The seminar was held under the auspices of Irtiqa Institute of Social 
Sciences.

"We start with a handicap of Rs 16 billion and the salaries hike 
recently announced by the government will add another Rs 5 billion to 
it," he observed.

He expressed apprehension that the high rate of taxation would divert 
investment from tariff to non-tariff areas thus bringing about 
distortions in the economy hurting indigenous industry in the process.

Dr Shahida Wizarat of the Applied Economics Research Centre (AERC) of 
the Karachi University, on the other hand, put forth a very positive 
view of the budget saying that the happiest portent of it all was the 
regaining of lost sovereignty-to some extent-in that many of the 
conditionalities laid down by the Bretton Woods Institutions had not 
been adhered to purely in the national interest.

It may be recalled here that the IMF had called for cutting the budget 
deficit to 4 percent of the GDP and bringing the maximum tariff rate to 
45 percent, but the budget proposed cutting down the deficit to 5 
percent and trimming tariffs to only 65 percent.

She said, the IMF had to be convinced that deviating from targets did 
not imply abandoning objectives.

Sajjad Akhtar, also from the AERC, was of the view that the Withholding 
Tax on bearer certificates proposed in the budget would discourage 
savings and divert them from productive channels.

Economic columnist Mr Sultan Ahmed, was of the opinion that it was a 
"note printing budget" which would inevitably lead to inflation. He 
apprehended that the figure of note printing could touch Rs 30 billion. 
He felt this was inevitable as the government had to spend 60 percent of 
its tax revenues on debt servicing alone.

Dr Mehnaz Fatima of the Institute of Business Administration, Karachi 
University, stressed the need for enhancing the spending on education 
and social welfare, which, she said, were the chief barometers of 
economic development. She was of the opinion that the present allocation 
of 2.8 percent of the GDP was insignificant given the needs of the 
country.

<a name="lowc">Low cotton stocks hit textile industry</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, June 25: With cotton stocks in the country near depletion, on 
an average, two textile spinning mills are being closed down in a week 
due to want of raw material.

According to textile industry sources, presently the country is carrying 
total raw cotton stocks of around 0.9 million bales. These stocks 
include 0.7 million bales held by the textile spinning industry, and 
about 0.2 million bales held by ginners and Cotton Export Corporation 
(CEC).

Against these stocks, the industry sources asserted that on an average 
the monthly consumption of the installed and working capacity of the 
spinning mills is above 0.7 million bales of raw cotton.

"If no immediate and corrective measures are taken to replenish the 
cotton stocks available to the country's largest industrial sector, 
about 40 to 60 percent of the industry would collapse by end August for 
want of raw material," exhorted a leading textile spinner.

The Cotton Export Corporation is holding around 0.1 million bales out of 
the imported raw cotton from Central Asian States (CAS) and is awaiting 
the distribution policy expected to be announced by the government in 
the near future.

The CEC had contracted 31,000 tonnes (0.175m bales) of raw cotton from 
Central Asian States late last year, and after receiving around 0.1 
million bales the fate of the balance, which comes to around 75,000 
bales, could not be known.

Similarly, the private sector that had also entered into purchase 
contracts for about 50,000 bales at the official level with these states 
and for around 0.1 million bales at private level, but they did not 
receive any quantity due to redtapism in these states, the textile 
industry sources lamented.

Out of the total of 0.4 million bales purchased from United States, so 
far around 0.2 million bales have reached Pakistan, while around 0.1 
million bales are in the pipeline.

"It is true that about 0.1 million bales purchased by Pakistani spinners 
from  the US, at a very lucrative price ranging between 70 to 90 cents 
per lb, were sold back by them in the intentional market when the raw 
cotton prices rose above 100 cents in the New York market," confessed 
Anwar Ahmed Tata Chairman All Pakistan Textile Mills Association 
(APTMA).

With no hopes of arrival of raw cotton from abroad, the spinners now 
feel that the next 3 months would be most crucial for the industry which 
may starve for want of raw cotton.

Mr Tata said that out of 450 textile units installed in the country, 
about 300 spinning units are presently working but if raw cotton is not 
made available, he apprehended that about 40 percent of them would also 
cease production by August this year.

He said that due to the high rate of closures in the textile industry, 
banks' outstanding dues have already shot up from Rs 80 billion to Rs 90 
billion in 1994-95 and in case no corrective measures are taken, the 
bank defaults would rise to Rs 100 billion by next year.

The APTMA chairman claimed that an average spinning unit having 15,000 
spindles is presently suffering a daily loss of around Rs 0.3 million 
per day.

He said that yarn prices are persistently falling in the domestic as 
well as international markets but the spinning industry at large 
continues to bear the high cost of production which is the highest in   
the region.

<a name="nbpt">NBP to float Modaraba : 6 modarbas allowed to diversify</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, June 25: The government-run National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) has 
received the clearance of the Religious Board to float a modaraba while 
six existing modarabas have been allowed to diversify themselves into 
the multipurpose modarabas.

Sources close to the Board told Dawn from Islamabad on Sunday that the 
stage is set for the launching of First National Bank Modaraba with a 
paid-up capital of Rs 500 million adding that the sponsors were busy 
seeking an authorisation certificate from Registrar of Modarabas for the 
said purpose.

The Board gives its clearance after ensuring that the businesses which 
the proposed modaraba intends to undertake are covered under Islamic 
laws while the Registrar issues an authorisation certificate after 
submission of a final prospectus by the modaraba.

Sources said the sponsors of the First NBP Modaraba were expected to 
submit their final prospectus within a few weeks and get the approval of 
the Registrar to float the modaraba.

They said the proposed Modarba be would be multipurpose in its nature 
and carry out such businesses as finance and leverage finance, equity 
market operations, project financing, venture capital and leverage 
leasing, besides dealing in Islamic finance instruments like musharaka 
and morabaha etc.

Presently 52 out of total 68 registered modarabas are operational and 
First NBP Modaraba would increase the list to 53. The proposed modaraba 
would be the third one launched by a government-run bank. Allied Bank 
Ltd and Habib Bank Ltd are already in the business.

Sources close to Religious Board said the Board had approved conversion 
of six specific-purpose modarabas into multi-purpose modarabas. The list 
includes (i) First Ibrahim Modaraba (ii) First Al-Noor Modaraba (iii) 
First Dadabhoy Modaraba (iv) Guardian Leasing Modaraba (v) First Sitara 
Modaraba and (vi.) Unity Modaraba.

Specific modarabas are the modarabas authorised to undertake only one 
kind of business while multi-purpose modarabas can involve themselves in 
a variety of businesses.

Sources said the above-listed modarabas were expected to submit their 
amended prospectus to the Registrar of Modarabas and get his formal 
approval before announcing their conversion from specific purpose 
modarabas into multi- purpose modarabas.

Sources said with the conversion of the above-mentioned modarabas would 
trim the list of the specific modarabas from seven to only one. The lone 
specific-purpose modaraba is Equity International Modaraba which 
operates in the area of venture capital. The modaraba is jointly 
sponsored by BRR Group and the International Finance Corporation (IFC).

Recently the Religious Board approved the pattern of Income Notes 
Certificate-a debt instrument to be used by the IFC for financing 
Pakistani modarabas on profit and loss sharing basis instead of fixed 
interest.

The move would help the liquidity-starved modaraba sector to benefit 
*from  the IFC to the tune of $100 million to $150 million.

Besides about a dozen modarabas have already been allowed to raise funds 
*from  the public through Certificates of Musharaka also an Islamic debt 
instrument designed on the basis of profit and loss sharing instead of 
fixed interest which Islam prohibits.

the IMF in the near future on the adjustments made in the ongoing 
programme of the Fund to accommodate the economic and political 
objectives of next year's budget, the prime minister's special assistant 
told Dawn here on Monday.  

He said, due to some critical economic and political developments taking 
place since the prime minister's visit to the USA when a number of 
proposals were discussed with the IMF regarding the third year of the 
programme and a tentative understanding reached in April 1995,"certain 
adjustments in the programme were made by the government and these 
adjustments will be the focus of government's discussions with the Fund 
in the near future."

According to Mr Khan, a programme of economic reforms and adjustments 
was not a one-time affair. "It is a continuous process spread over 
several years which is periodically reviewed and updated as experience 
is gained during the implementation."

He said the government was committed to pursuing the programme, "not 
because of any external influence, but because we feel that it is the 
only way to revive the sagging economy and bring about discipline in the 
country's economic management."

<a name="inde">Index falls further as stocks maintain bearish outlook</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, June 28: Stocks maintained a bearish outlook on Thursday as 
leading investors were not inclined to take new positions apparently 
awaiting a breather in the City violence.  

Trading volume was, however, extremely low, reflecting the absence of 
leading sellers and it could well prove a good omen for the general 
health of an uncertain stock trading.  

Instances of strong speculative buying were, however, not lacking as a 
section of investors moved from the high risk areas to the relatively 
safer-havens in a bid to avert any undue losses. 

Floor brokers said, as there is no indications of an improvement in the 
City law and order situation in the near future, dealers and investors 
are moving cautiously and are not inclined to tread on risky path.

"The presence of strong institutional support though on selected 
countries is chief reason behind the current calm market stance," they 
added.  

Analysts said, the market might have collapsed in similar conditions as 
the prevailing one. Being essentially sensitive to negative external 
news it always emits distress signals.  

But it went to the credit of financial support, though on selected  
counters, which did not allow the total bear-run, they added. 

However, there appeared to be no possibility of an immediate turnaround 
as much will depend on the City situation and when sanity returns to 
stem the polarisation.

<a name="gene">The general's generals</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

GENERAL Khalid Mahmud Arif has written well. His book (third impression 
being printed, fourth planned) is informative.

For his opening chapter he has borrowed a title from that master of 
English prose, Winston Spencer Churchill, without giving credit where 
credit is due. Volume 1 of WSC's monumental work, The Second World War, 
was entitled 'The Gathering Storm', the title General Arif chose for his 
first chapter.

With Arif's Working with Zia, it is hard to determine a moral. To be 
able to do so, we will have to wait for him to publish his second volume 
in which he should reveal, for the benefit of history and for the people 
of his country, all that he knows and which he has accepted his share of 
the blame and has not disassociated himself from the doings of the man 
with whom he worked so closely for ten long years.

Zia got to be the Chief of Army Staff through the old art of sycophancy, 
practised successfully through the ages by so many men intent on getting 
to so many high places. He bowed and scraped and ingratiated himself, 
and it worked.

According to General Faiz Ali Chishti, in his hook, Betrayals of another 
Kind, Zia "had to be the best sycophant to win over Mr Bhutto". Chishti 
relates the method of sycophancy adopted by Zia in 1975, when he was 
Corps Commander in Multan, in order firstly to get close to the PPP 
leaders of the area and then to the Great Leader, ZAB himself. He made 
frequent visits to the houses of Sahibzada Faruq, Hamid Raza Gilani, 
Sadiq Hussain Qureshi and others who were high in the party hierarchy. 
"He literally used to beg for invitations", Chishti recounts.

Whilst in Multan, Zia apparently wrote a letter to General Sahibzada 
Yaqub Khan, then our ambassador in Washington, asking him to help 
install ZAB as Colonel in-Chief of the Armoured Corps. It was unheard of 
for a politician to be granted such an honour. But this disgraceful 
anomaly was finally achieved through the good offices of the then COAS, 
General Tikka Khan, a solid PPP supporter. One story has it that Zia had 
a special uniform laid out for ZAB for wearing at his investiture, but 
at the last minute ZAB got cold feet and decided not to change out of 
his civvies.

When the time came, in 1975, for ZAB to replace Tikka who was due to 
retire in March 1976, the Lieutenant-Generals in order of seniority 
were, Muhammad Sharif, Muhammad Akbar Khan, Aftab Ahmed Khan, Azamat 
Baksh Awan, Agha Ali Ibrahim Akram, Malik Abdul Majeed, Ghulam Jilani 
Khan, and Muhammad Ziaul-Haq.

Arif tells how the sycophants once more came into play. ZAB having 
already made up his mind that Zia was his man, discussed the appointment 
of the new COAS with such underlings as Akram Shaikh (Director, 
Intelligence Bureau), Said Ahmed Khan (his Chief Security Officer), 
Masood Mahmood, (Director of the gestapolike FSF), Lt General Ghulam 
Jilani Khan (DG, ISI), Brigadier Muzaffar Khan Malik (of the National 
Security Council), Major General Imtiaz (his Military Secretary), 
Maulana Kausar Niazi, and the smooth sycophant, "the Bhutto Boy" of the 
Intelligence Bureau, Lt Colonel Mukhtar Ahmed who had been specially 
inducted to keep a watch on the army.

We can be sure that not one of these smart intelligence chiefs dared 
voice one word against ZAB's proposed appointment. Yesmen to the last, 
they must have praised him for his wise and brilliant choice. So much 
for our so-called intelligence agencies who continue to spend enormous 
amounts of the people's money without any accountability at all.

According to General Arif, not one of the superseded generals opposed 
the appointment to ZAB's face, though God knows what their inner 
thoughts were.

The general, in his book, betrays no signs of sycophancy, so let us give 
him the benefit of the doubt and presume that Zia chose well when he 
appointed him his COS, to cover his rear. Zia perhaps followed General 
George Smith Patton's maxim that a loyal officer is preferred to a 
brilliant one. It cannot be denied that Arif remained loyal to his 
chief, and remains so to this day.

Working With Zia naturally covers the break-up of the country, and tells 
us how Pakistan was broken in folly. Arif tells us what many of us know, 
that the principal architect of 'East Pakistan Amputated' (as he heads 
the relevant chapter) was ZAB, who deceived the incompetent President, 
General Yahya Khan bringing down both him and the country. Yahya, says 
Arif, was "a shrewd and intelligent person. He possessed a discerning 
mind which quickly grasped the essentials of martial law, worked hard 
and took timely decisions which met with public approval. Thereafter he 
became over-confident and complacent. He started relying heavily on the 
coloured advice of a handful of advisers who put a ring of isolation 
around him... As the pressure of work increased so did his urge for hard 
drinks".

Arif recounts how towards the end of his rule, the Rangila Raja, drank 
excessively and indulged in activities unworthy of his high office... 
Yahya enjoyed ephemeral pleasures".

After the dismemberment of the country the Hamoodur Rahman Commission 
was appointed to inquire into its circumstances. ZAB apparently 
destroyed all copies of the HRC report except one which he kept 
carefully under lock and key in his Secretariat. Following his arrest, 
when his documents were collected, one volume of the sole existing copy 
of the Report was found to be missing. ZAB's house was searched, and the 
volume was found hidden in a wall safe. The HRC, for reasons we all more 
or less know, has never been made public. Arif, who as virtual chief of 
the army at the time, must be very familiar with the contents of the 
Report and could well have confirmed to us just why it was and still is 
thought to be not fit for the eyes of the country's citizens. He could 
also have revealed exactly what was in the volume so carefully hidden by 
ZAB. 

After the passage of more than 20 years, surely we can now be told. They 
know all about it over the border. Scouring through the Indian Press, 
>from  time to time we come upon references to and quotes from the 
mysterious Hamoodur Rahman Report.

Back to the present, and we leave Arif and his book for another day. it 
is time once again for the selection of a COAS to succeed General Waheed 
who retires this coming January. In the most august and honourable 
National Assembly on June 18, Chaudhry Nisar, of military background and 
connections, observed that "the army is never loyal to a particular 
government. If you think you can do anything by bringing in a general of 
your own choice after Waheed, you are mistaken. If you bother to find 
out what is being said and discussed in army quarters, messes and on the 
parade grounds, you will know the truth".

Come what may, following the thinking of her father, Benazir will 
disregard merit. She will seek out a subservient man, who will please 
her with his consummate sycophancy, and do her bidding.

<a name="vola">A volatile week</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

STOCKS turned in a volatile performance during the preceding week as 
investors were not inclined to take new positions and played on both 
sides of the fence owing mainly to city violence. After an early steep 
rise, what the dealers called, post-budget reaction to some of the 
positive fiscal incentives to the corporate sector in the new federal 
budget, the market fell later.

However, as there were not many sustaining factors, investors took 
profits at the early inflated level, pushing the market into the 
downward territory.

The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices, which at one stage, 
appeared to have consolidated itself well above the psychological level 
of 1,600 points, was finally quoted at 1,611.26 as against last week's 
1,590,27, reflecting the weakness of the base shares.

The market capitalisation which had risen to Rs.319-billion after having 
fallen from the peak of Rs. 442 billion last week owing to pre-budget 
strong speculative buying fell to Rs.314 billion.

The stocks remained hostage to the city killings as attempted rallies on 
selected counters failed to generate sympathetic buying on other 
sectors. Investors were worried over the increasing incidents of 
violence and stayed away.

<a name="kara">Karachi events confuse visiting Senators  </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's surprise offensive against 
Altaf Hussain's MQM, which has now been officially declared as a 
terrorist organisation, has landed five "poor" senators from Pakistan 
into an unwanted soup- their Kashmir junket has turned into a Karachi 
nightmare.

The five Pakistani senators, carefully selected to represent the four 
provinces and Karachi, now in Washington to lobby for the Kashmir cause, 
are the most distressed lot in town because events in Karachi have 
overtaken their Kashmir agenda and everyone they meet is interested only 
in finding out what is happening to Pakistan's commercial capital.

Led by former law minister Iqbal Haider, the Senators were hardly aware 
that in their first two days in Washington, they would have to answer 
all the questions about Karachi's worsening situation and hardly any on 
Kashmir. The rest of their official engagements are going to be 
different in no way.

The Senators, including Hamid Raza Gilani, Masood Kausar, Dr Abdul Hayee 
Baloch and Hussain Shah Rashdi, are not the only ones who are facing 
this cross examination. After headlines screamed in Washington media 
about the killings in Karachi, everyone connected to the sub-continent 
is asked the same question and no one, including the Senators, has any 
answer.

The Senators were grilled for almost four hours by Pakistan community 
intellectuals on Sunday morning and later for another two hours by 
Pakistani newsmen at Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi's residence. They were 
confused, mostly eventhey unable to speak out their mind lest Benazir 
Bhutto may get annoyed and at times appeared disgusted with their 
leadership. The one question which none of them could answer was: "Why 
has Benazir Bhutto decided to launch an offensive against the Mohajirs 
in a manner that would leave them with no option but to think about 
separation from Pakistan ?"

This question seemed to be crudely phrased but in the background of what 
has happened in Pakistan in the last few days, it was the sharpest media 
trick to get to the bottom of the situation.

These recent developments included the federal government's case on MQM, 
submitted to the Supreme Court. After reading that version, it is hard 
to believe that the government could ever again have political 
negotiations with the MQM.

MQM has been officially labelled as terrorists, foreign agents, 
separatists, saboteurs, anti-state and what not. And that is the 
position of the federation of Pakistan. The prime minister has come out 
in even stronger words against Altaf Hussain and his band. "Altaf Group" 
is now the official name for terrorists.

And these strong words are being used when police and the para- military 
forces are totally paralysed and over-powered in Karachi. Violence has 
escalated to the level that rockets are now the norm, rather than 
exception and roads are ruled by gangs. Business and even stock exchange 
had to close down.

With administration in a state of total breakdown the army seemed to be 
watching the situation from the sidelines after having burnt its fingers 
in Karachi for almost 30 months. They are, in a way, enjoying to see the 
politicians stew in their own juices.

In such a situation, why has Benazir Bhutto taken the offensive and what 
are her means to deliver on the strong words she is using so often, the 
visiting Senators were repeatedly asked. They were clueless.

At the Ambassador's dinner for the Senators and a few Pakistani newsmen, 
the Senators were asked by me to give a "one liner" reply to the 
question of what would happen to Karachi. Their response was 
interesting:

Iqbal Haider: Karachi would return to normal after the present phase and 
terrorists would be eliminated. (He had much more to say off the 
record).

Rashdi: There would be a civil war and whoever wins would rule Karachi.

Masood Kausar: We (people of NWFP) are confused and don't know what is 
happening.

Dr Hayee Baloch: I hope things would improve but I don't know.

Hamid Raza Gilani: It is a larger conspiracy and things have gone out of 
the hands of Altaf Hussain as well.

Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi, Nation's Khalid Hasan, APP's Afzal Khan, 
columnist Dr Manzur Ejaz and Dr Hassan Shahzeb, a Pakistani doctor who 
presented a solution to the Karachi problem at a George Washington 
University Forum earlier in the week, looked at the senators, in awe and 
almost stupefied.  

Dr Hassan's solution included 10-points, starting from division of 
Karachi into 10 units, holding of local bodies polls under army  
supervision after judicial scrutiny of candidates to eliminate persons 
with criminal record, disbanding the present police force and forming 
municipal police under elected representatives, designation of MNAs from 
Karachi to make room for genuine representatives, Islamabad should 
prepare to live with lesser revenues from Karachi, a rapprochement with 
India should be attempted and Establishment should stop patronising the 
militant clergy.

No one discussed these solutions in detail but everyone was feeling the 
urgency for a solution to the Karachi issue lest things get out of hands 
of the politicians.

In undertones there was the fear that Benazir Bhutto was being led up 
the war path by some misguided individuals in her Administration. 
Knowing Benazir Bhutto's style of government when, at times, she accedes 
to even the wildest of ideas if they are coming from someone she thinks 
is a welwisher, she could well have been misinformed.

But what almost everyone was unable to comprehend was why Benazir was 
acting as an authoritarian military ruler, when her forte should have 
been political dialogue and consensus on such tricky and sensitive 
issues as the peace of Karachi, the lifeline of the country's economy.

Dr Hassan has also noted the same in his paper to the George Washington 
University: "They (Benazir & Co) are forgetting the basic lessons of 
history. They are relying too much on their new found love with the 
Establishment. They should remember that Nawaz Sharif was once a blue-
eyed boy of the same Establishment. In a nutshell they have failed to 
govern in a mature way. Some utterances on the part of the Prime 
Minister are simply irresponsible and even juvenile." 

No body said it but it could be felt that everybody was now looking upto 
President Farooq Leghari as the only ray of hope for any political 
solution to this murky situation. Leghari's views have been much more 
moderate and sensible and there have also been mutterings of differences 
between Benazir Bhutto and the President.

What would happen if the President and the Prime Minister were to 
develop real differences on the issue is a million dollar question. But 
the saying "history repeats itself", was meant for all ages and times.

<a name="ofmi">Of Mice and Men : Seeking forgiveness</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Hafiz-Ur-Rehman

IF I had anything to do with the destiny of this country I would spend a 
lot of my time, energy and persuasive powers in trying to convince my 
people that we owe a national apology to the people of Bangladesh.

After I have brought them round to my way of thinking, I would take a 
large representative delegation (including top brass from the defence 
services) to Dhaka, and there, in an address at Paltan Maidan, formally 
and in a spirit of genuine contrition, seek the Bengalis' pardon for 
thrusting our imperialism on them which led to their breaking away from 
us in 1971.

If Japan can do this and seek the forgiveness of the Chinese, an alien 
people, for the barbarities and inhuman treatment they infected on them 
in the Sino-Japanese War, why can't we adopt a similar gesture towards a 
people we still claim are a part and parcel of our psyche and our so-
called Islamic spirit?

In Bangladesh, they say to visiting (West) Pakistanis: "We still love 
you, but we couldn't live with you in a master-servant relationship. You 
do not realise it but you started the alienation process right in 1948. 
We would have laid down our lives for Pakistan, but not for our masters 
in West Pakistan."

Incidentally, they also say, "And we are told you have found a scapegoat 
in Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. How is it possible for one man to break up a 
country by just saying, Idhar ham udhar tum? Believe us when we say that 
even if he had not uttered these words, even if you had agreed to make 
Mujibur Rahman prime minister or president, we couldn't have stayed 
together. You people are incapable of change or getting rid of your 
superiority complex".

I have been going through a paper on the Bengali Language Movement 
written by Dr Tariq Rahman for a learned journal. It has revived old 
memories and old perceptions dimmed by time. It also took me back to 
those early days of Pakistan when the people of East Bengal and of West 
Pakistan had common aspirations and the new state was an exciting 
adventure for both.

There must have been something wrong with me as a Punjabi that I looked 
at Bengalis as equal partners in that adventure. Much as I respected, 
admired and even loved the Quaid-i-Azam, I was taken aback by his firm 
declaration in Dhaka that Bengalis were welcome to use their language in 
their provincial affairs but the national language of Pakistan would be 
Urdu and Urdu alone.

The best of leaders are sometimes mistaken, or misled. I'm not trying to 
explain away the Quaid's unequivocal stand on the issue, but I have a 
feeling that, being a non-Urdu speaking person himself, he was led into 
believing that all Pakistanis were united on the national language. That 
those who differed were only mischief-makers.

I am no historian, just a student and observer of events and 
personalities. My reading of the Pakistan story tells me that all the 
political personalities really close to the Quaid were from West 
Pakistan who could not conceive of any other language sharing the 
limelight with Urdu. Those from East Bengal who were also close to him, 
like, for instance, Khwaja Nazimuddin, themselves spoke Urdu and did not 
represent the true feelings of the Bengalis.

Anyway, the fact remains that the fight for Bengali became, over the 
years, a fight for Bengal, a fight for a greater share in the governance 
of the country. It also became a demand for a more decent and sensitive 
attitude from the Western brothers who were incorrigible in thinking of 
themselves superior to Bengalis in everything-in looks, in brains the 
way they spoke English, and the stylish way in which they lived.

They viewed the Bengalis with contempt. (Don't let anyone try to tell me 
they didn't.) The simple life-style of those people, their strong 
emotional reactions, their stress on their own brand of nationalism, 
were all hateful to West Pakistanis, and these Brown Sahibs made no 
secret of their feelings. It was imperialism all the way, and worse than 
the imperialism the Bengalis had seen in Englishmen, since it came from 
one's own people.

How many times did I not hear the words, "These fellows only understand 
the danda, the stick. That's the only way to keep them in order." The 
West Pakistanis- actually civil and military Punjabis and the elite 
among the Urdu-speaking officers-had discovered a colony and were 
enjoying every minute of ruling over it.

My wife says I have "a black tongue" of the Urdu idiom which predicts 
only dark happenings, a sort of Pakistani Cassandra, because I had told 
her in the early sixties, "If we carry on like this, the Bengalis will 
go their own way in ten years." I don't claim any prescience, it was 
plain common sense, and any idiot who kept his antennae in working order 
could have seen it the way I did. It only needed putting aside one's pet 
notions.

This subject is fit for a book, and books have been written on it. I 
wonder if those of us who were responsible for alienating the Bengalis 
ever got to reading them. I don't think so. Most of us still hold on to 
our colonial ideas, and make them evident in our dealings with the other 
peoples also who happen to inhabit Pakistan. We have learned no lesson.

History cannot be overturned. What has happened cannot be undone. The 
hatred of years inspired by our treatment of the Bengalis and our snooty 
attitude towards them cannot be transformed into love now. And even if 
it could, what can it give us now and what purpose will it serve when we 
stand separated? And don't forget that apart from our complexes about 
ourselves and about the Bengalis they are better off as a nation, for 
they are more united than we are. Maybe this is our punishment.

The first thing friends and relations ask when you return from a visit 
to Dhaka is: "Are the Bengalis sorry now for breaking away?" These 
people think that our "benevolent rule" over East Pakistan was a 
blessing from God which the Bengalis failed to appreciate at that time 
so they must be regretting their behaviour now. What a pity that a 
little love and understanding could have averted that great calamity of 
separation.

Whatever you may think about it, I honestly feel that a conscious, 
calculated move to beg the Bengalis' forgiveness is called for. It 
will do what no amount of diplomatic, trade, social and cultural 
relations can ever achieve. We talk incessantly of Islam. Let us do 
at least one of the many good things that Islam advises us to do: 
promote affection and harmony between two constituents of the ummah.

<a name="cris">MQM & Karachi crisis </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Dr Mohammad Waseem

AT the heart of the current MQM agitation lies Altaf Hussain. While he 
has been in direct or indirect control of this party for a decade or so, 
his role has been analysed essentially as a charismatic leader capable 
of and insisting on making decisions on his own. In reality, he has all 
along operated in a complex network of relations with his partymen, 
which provides the proper context for explaining the current wave of 
political violence and future prospects of peace in Karachi.

A major concern of Altaf Hussain is to survive as a political leader of 
the MQM and its constituency the Mohajir community. Gone are the days 
when he was a confident, assertive, pragmatic and realistic leader of a 
political party which was struggling for safeguarding the interests of 
its constituency through electoral politics. Unfortunately, he has to 
his credit a relatively long career of blundering his way through 
bizarre coalitions and violent agitations. From an alleged creation of 
the intelligence wing of the armed services, he has led his community to 
a headon collision with the army and various state agencies. From a 
partner in coalition with the PPP, he has led his followers to an 
extremely adversarial relations with that party, with no chances of an 
early rapprochement with it. From joining the IJI-PML alliance and 
subsequently getting alienated from it to relying on it once again in 
utter desperation, he has made a series of overtures to a party of no 
consequence in Sindh.

Not surprisingly, Altaf Hussain is struggling for his political 
survival. He is a leader who got maximum support from his community but 
gave it frustration and desperation in return. The struggle for his 
survival has led Altaf Hussain to place himself at the centre of the 
MQM's demand structure. Withdrawal of criminal cases against him and 
grant of permission to him to operate freely in the political field are 
demands which have held the whole political process hostage in Sindh. 
This is a credit to the ingenuity of Altaf Hussain that he has 
intertwined his fate with the fate of a whole community. In this way, he 
has halted the process of political bargaining between the two political 
parties, the PPP and the MQM, representing Sindhis and Mohajirs 
respectively. 

A part of Altaf Hussain's strategy to pursue his battle for survival is 
to disallow the emergence of a pattern of leadership which might have-
the potential of eventually displacing him from his role on top of the 
MQM. One after another, he has changed the composition of the MQM's 
negotiating team so as not to allow any MQM leader to remain in the 
public eye for too long. What he fears most is the gradual building of 
public trust in any one of his lieutenants ranging from Ishtiaq Azhar to 
Farooq Sattar and others. Similarly, when he sees the growth of 
operational power on the ground in the hands of one or the other MQM 
Senator or MPA, he finds it necessary to cut him or her down to size. It 
is a demagogue's strategy for survival par excellence.  

On their part, the cadres and workers of the MQM use Altaf Hussain for 
their own purposes. They extensively rely on him as a symbol of the 
Mohajir ethnonationalist movement. They do this for gaining legitimacy 
in the eyes of their peers in the party or in the locality. They try to 
outdo each other in showing loyalty to Altaf Hussain, referring every 
decision to him in London and quoting him in and out of context. Altaf 
is thus used and abused for legitimacy purposes. His name is a political 
resource in the pool of symbols for the Mohajir movement which every 
political careerist finds it necessary to appropriate. 

Being within the hearing of Altaf Hussain is not only a feather in the 
cap of all MQM stalwarts. In fact, his name is also attached to parallel 
or even contradictory decisions for what is usually described as the 
cause of unity in the Mohajir ranks. In other words, the MQM leaders and 
workers have increasingly turned Altaf Hussain into an extremely useful 
symbol of political power and influence at home. As time passes, he is 
losing real operational power and is being elevated to a high symbolic 
position which is in turn tapped by dominant factions within the party 
As an exile, Altaf is acutely dependent on his channels of communication 
at home in order to arrive at decisions in urgent or not so-urgent 
matters. Therefore, the local leaders have taken the initiative 
essentially in terms of choosing the type of message to be communicated 
to the party chief, its wording, its timing as well as a suggested line 
of action in response to the message itself. In this way, Altaf 
Hussain's decisions from a distance of five thousand miles tend to be 
manipulatet by his lieutenant.

Not surprisingly the fateful decision of Altaf Hussain to boycott 
elections for the National Assembly  in 1993 cost the MQM extremely 
heavily because it destroyed the party's bargaining capacity at the 
federal level. Altaf's leadership through remote control was based at 
that time, and continues to  be based at present, on a myopic vision, 
which is for all practical purposes is a faxed vision. It is possible 
that the relatively assertive section of the local MQM leadership would 
have shown their disagreement with their leader's unwise decision. 
However, the immediate reversal of the boycott strategy for elections of 
the Sindh Assembly at least partially compensated for the ineptness of 
the previous decision. The abdication of decision-making authority in 
favour of Altaf Hussain by the local MQM leadership has robbed the party 
of pragmatic and flexible response to political developments at home.

This two-step decision-making process has cost the MQM in terms of its 
negotiating pull with the concerned authorities, be it the army 
leadership, the caretaker government of Moeen Qureshi or the present 
government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. It is obvious that no 
negotiations will be allowed to go very far if they do not reinstate 
Altaf Hussain in the politics of Pakistan. It has been argued by the MQM 
that the solution of the current crisis lies only through Altaf Hussain. 
But, as a convict and in exile, Altaf's interests are limited and his 
logic is involute. No wonder, the PPP-MQM negotiations have run aground.

Altaf Hussain and the MQM leadership have produced what can be described 
as a Mohajir mindset.

This mindset is imbued with a litany of sacrifices, persecution syndrome 
as well as endemic separatism reflected through various models ranging 
>from  Hong Kong Singapore-Jinnahpur model to a model based on some kind 
of separation from Sindh. A large part of this mindset can be attributed 
to the efforts of Altaf Hussain and his colleagues during the last 
decade. Even those Mohajirs who oppose the MQM politics have selectively 
embraced the MQM idiom about sacrifices and persecution. Such is the 
power of ethnicity even while the immediate casualty is truth.

On the other hand, a strong criticism of Altaf Hussain has set in even 
within the traditional MQM constituency. People tend to criticise him on 
various grounds, especially on aspects of his political discourse.

However, there is no immediate challenge to his leadership from within 
the ranks of the MQM. This is in sharp contrast to the patterns of other 
ethnic movements such as the Baloch or Sindhi nationalism. The latter 
fell a prey to factional splits and fractionalisation because the older 
ties of tribal or village community continued to operate as sub-
identities.

As opposed to this, the Mohajir community of urban Sindh is essentially 
an atomised society, comprising elements from different tribal, caste, 
ethnic, sectoral and sectarian backgrounds. There are no rival 
identities operating against the dominant Mohajir identity in urban 
Sindh. Altaf Hussain was the direct beneficiary of this state of affairs 
in the last decade. On the other hand, when the cracks appear within his 
organisation, the absence of a cushion against imminent splattering in 
the form of tribal or village-based identities will lead to political 
disaster.

Altaf Hussain seems to have already played his historical role in 
creating and consolidating the Mohajir identity in the past. The future 
holds no prospects for him given his conviction and exile. 
Meanwhile, the present is both unpleasant and insecure for him, as he is 
deprived of the status as a free citizen of Pakistan despite his 
following spread over millions.

<a name="circ">The circus in the Punjab</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Tahir Mirza

LAHORE: Every morning here in Lahore we are regaled by statements from 
the chief minister, the senior minister, various other ministers and 
advisers as well as assorted functionaries of the PPP and the PML(J) 
about the health of the coalition government in the province. When 
Chaudhary Altaf was alive, we used to have a statement or two from him 
also, God bless his soul, but the new governor has got into the act 
quickly enough. As he is entertained nightly by one minister or the 
other, he too obliges reporters in attendance with comments on 
differences within the PDF. 

Following these official pronouncements and reading the reports in the 
newspapers the next day, it appears that there is no issue before the 
provincial cabinet and the provincial organisations of the PPP and the 
PDF bigger than what one side is saying about the other. The people and 
their problems can go hang. Let-us look at the headlines from various 
newspapers for just one day, Wednesday, with, as the reader will notice, 
Mr Manzoor Wattoo waxing almost typically "There have been 
misunderstandings between the coalition parties before and there will be 
misunderstandings in the future. We bend where we have to bend, where we 
have to advance, we advance, where we have to beat a retreat, we 
retreat." "The provincial assembly will not be dissolved! Governor 
Saroop. "Ups and downs constitute the beauty of politics! "Mr Wattoo. 
"Efforts should be made to reform the chief minister, otherwise the 
alliance will not work." Afzal Chan (PPP member). "The affairs of Punjab 
will be decided within Punjab. If a problem is not solved, then we can 
go to the president or the prime minister."-Governor Saroop. "There is 
no question of the assembly being dissolved. Misunderstandings will 
end."  Mr Wattoo "I have understood the governor's statement. A branch 
which is flexible is in less danger of being broken." Mr Wattoo "One 
should not pay any attention to rumours." Governor Saroop. The more they 
talk, the worse everything looks. The impression of a severe crisis 
becomes stronger.

There is a crisis in Punjab. It is a crisis of confidence and trust 
between the PML(J) and the PPP. It has been there almost since the 
coalition government was formed. The differences between the coalition 
partners are not about policy or ideology, when they would have enjoyed 
at least some distinction; in any  case, ideologically, there is nothing 
to choose between the two parties. The differences or 
"misunderstandings" are about privileges and distribution of development 
funds. The problem was inherent in the coalition. Mr Wattoo has 18 
members of his own in the 248-seat assembly plus about the same number 
of independents who support him. The PPP has 100 members and is the 
larger party. But it cannot form a government of its own without the 
PML(J)'s support, and that is why Mr Wattoo is chief minister. If the 
arithmetic had not been like this and the PPP had won more seats, Mr 
Wattoo would not be at the helm of affairs in Punjab. Since he is, the 
PPP members should be told by the leadership that they'd better, in 
words now made famous by Mr John Major, "put up or shut up." At the 
moment there seems to be no alternative to Mr Wattoo. The PPP hotheads 
have to ask themselves only this one question! if the coalition is 
disbanded today, who or what will replace it tomorrow? If the PPP tries 
to destabilise Mr Wattoo, it will hurt its credibility among its 
remaining allies, with many of its partners in the struggle for 
democracy already disillusioned with its performance. But Mr Wattoo too 
has to stop using his office to so blatantly favour his own people and 
present himself as being more powerful than he actually is. The 
allegations made about the distribution of funds and recruitments in 
government should be seriously answered. Many of us who have not 
entirely lost faith in our democracy repeatedly point to the extent of 
accountability now in evidence, as reflected daily in newspaper stories 
about the high and the mighty. But what is the point in such 
accountability if those named do not still feel accountable? Our leaders 
simply do not seem bothered to reply to the charges published about them 
or to issue any clarifications. Silence on such matters can be seen only 
as acceptance of guilt. Mr Wattoo too has yet to convince the people of 
the province that he is providing them with a clean and honest 
administration; in fact because of his running feud with his coalition 
partners, there is no doubt that development work is suffering, with 
only the bureaucrats happy, playing off one side against the other. 
Perhaps the new governor will better spend his time in taking notice of 
public complaints about everyday problems and the law-and order 
situation rather than in making trite remarks about the coalition. He at 
least would do well to keep himself away from the daily circus.

<a name="date">Dateline Washington : The considered State Dept view</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai

THE LATEST State Department assessment of Pakistan's recent political 
history states that the Benazir Bhutto government in 1990 was 
ineffective and corrupt, Nawaz Sharif's economic reforms greatly 
improved Pakistan's economic performance and business climate and Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan subverted the Nawaz Sharif government in May 1993. "It is an 
assessment which places Benazir Bhutto in a very negative frame while 
promoting Nawaz Sharif and his achievements,?' according to an analyst 
who does not belong to Pakistan.

The State Department views are contained in the official country profile 
documented as "Background Notes" on Pakistan, published by the 
Department's Bureau of Public Affairs in April and now available for 
everyone, with no restriction on reprinting its contents.

The profile gives, in a concise form, all basic data and information on 
Pakistan to a visitor like geography, population, growth rates of 
economy, per capita income, trade figures, exchange rates, a brief 
history, foreign relations with US and other countries, business and 
travel information and names of important officials in the respective 
embassies in both countries. It is the section on history and 
particularly under the sub-heading "The return of Democracy" that gives 
the authentic State Department view on what happened in the crucial 
period between 1990 and 1993 when Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif were 
dismissed, elections were held twice and palace intrigues and behind-
the-scene manipulations determined the political future of Pakistan. 

The important points and observations given below need to be 
highlighted:  

- It gives no opinion on Gen Zia's 1984 referendum and only mentions 
that against Zia's claims of 90 per cent success, "many observers 
questioned these figures."  

- It says the 1985 non-party elections were legitimate because of 53 per 
cent voter turnout and absence of fraud.

- It says "The (1990) October elections, observed by several 
international organisations, confirmed the political ascendancy of IJI", 
thus implicitly dismissing Benazir Bhutto's allegations that these 
elections were rigged.

- Giving reasons for dismissal of the Benazir Bhutto government, the 
profile says: "A fragmentation in the governing coalition and the 
military's reluctance to support an ineffectual and corrupt government 
were accompanied by a significant deterioration in law and order." The 
point to be noted here is that none of these words has been either 
attributed to someone or put under quotes. In comparison when reasons 
for dismissal of Nawaz Sharif in 1993 are discussed, all the reasons- 
administration, corruption and nepotism-are in quotes.

- It says president Ghulam Ishaq Khan continued his efforts to subvert 
the Nawaz Sharif government by engineering dissolution of the Punjab and 
the NWFP Assemblies, and the charge is direct, not attributed to anyone.

- The Mazari government, it notes experienced a problem of credibility 
because of allegations of corruption against its members.

The Moeen Qureshi  government, it says adopted political, social and 
economic reforms that generated considerable domestic supported foreign 
admiration.

- The profile lists Mohajirs as the fifth ethnic group in Pakistan after 
Punjabis, Sindhis, Pathans and Balochs.

The portion dealing with "The Return of Democracy" is reproduced here, 
in full:  

"On December 30,1985, President Zia removed martial law and restored 
constitutional rights safeguarded under the Constitution. He also lifted 
the Bhutto government's declaration of emergency powers. The first 
months of 1986 witnessed a rebirth of political activity throughput 
Pakistan. All parties-including those continuing to deny the legitimacy 
of the Zia/Junejo government-were permitted to organise and hold 
rallies. In April 1986, PPP leader Benazir Bhutto, daughter of Zulfiqar 
Ali Bhutto, returned to Pakistan from exile in Europe. 

" Following the lifting of martial law, prime minister Junejo attempted 
to make his Pakistan Muslim League (PML) a political party capable of 
competing with the PPP and its MRD allies on a national level. His 
increasing political independence and differences with Zia over Afghan 
policy resulted in tensions between them. Zia was a firm advocate of the 
Afghan resistance, which had been fighting Soviet forces since they 
invaded Afghanistan in 1979; Junejo repeatedly expressed his concern 
over the effect the conflict and the presence of some 3 million Afghan 
refugees had on Pakistan's internal security.

"On May 29,1988, President Zia dismissed the Junejo government and 
called for November elections. In June Zia proclaimed the supremacy in 
Pakistan of Shari'a (Islamic law)? by which all civil law had to conform 
to traditional Muslim edicts.

" OD August 17, a plane carrying President Zia, American Ambassador 
Arnold Raphel, US Brig-Gen. Herbert Wassom, and 28 Pakistani military 
officers crashed on a return flight from a military equipment trial near 
Bahawalpur, killing all of its occupants. In accordance with the 
Constitution, chairman of the Senate Ghulam Ishaq Khan became acting 
President.

" Ghulam Ishaq Khan announced that the elections, scheduled for 
November, would take place. 

After winning 93 of the 205 National Assembly seats contested, the PPP, 
under the leadership of Benazir Bhutto, formed a coalition government 
with several smaller parties, including the Mohajir Qaumi Movement 
(MQM). The Islamic Democratic Alliance (IJI), a multiparty coalition led 
by the PML and including religious right parties such as the Jamaati-
Islami (JI), won 55 National Assembly seats.

"Differing interpretations of constitutional authority, debates over the 
powers of the central government relative to those of the provinces, and 
the antagonistic relationship between the Bhutto administration and 
opposition governments in Punjab and Balochistan seriously impeded 
social and economic reform programmes. Ethnic conflict, primarily in 
Sindh province, exacerbated these problems. A fragmentation in the 
governing coalition and the military's reluctance to support an 
apparently ineffectual and corrupt government were accompanied by a 
significant deterioration in law and order.

"In August 1990, President Khan, citing his powers under the Eighth 
Amendment to the Constitution, dismissed the Bhutto government, 
dissolved the national and provincial assemblies, and announced new 
elections to be held in October. He appointed opposition leader Ghulam 
Mustafa Jatoi as caretaker prime minister and appointed caretaker 
governments in each of the four provinces.

"The October elections, observed by several international organization 
confirmed the political ascendancy of the IJI. In addition to a two-
thirds majority in the National Assembly the alliance acquired control 
of all four provincial parliaments and enjoyed the support of the 
military and of President Khan. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, as leader of the 
PML, the most prominent party in the IJI, was elected prime minister by 
the National Assembly.

"Sharif emerged as the most secure and powerful Pakistani prime minister 
since the mid1970s.

Under his rule, the IJI achieved several important political victories. 
The implementation of Sharif's economic reform programme, involving 
privatisation, deregulation, and encouragement of private sector 
economic growth, greatly improved Pakistan's economic performance and 
business climate. 

The passage into law in May 1991 of a Shariat bill, providing for 
widespread Islamisation, legitimised the IJI government among much of 
Pakistani society. The military's participation in the allied forces 
during the Gulf War improved Pakistan's relations within the world 
community.

"However, Nawaz Sharif was not able to reconcile the different 
objectives of the IJI's constituent parties. The largest fundamentalist 
party, Jamaati Islami (JI), abandoned the alliance because of its 
perception of PML hegemony. The regime was weakened further by the 
military's suppression of the MQM, which had entered into a coalition 
with the IJI to contain PPP influence, and allegations of corruption 
directed at Nawaz Sharif.  

" Prime minister Nawaz Sharif wanted to place his own candidate in the 
vacant chief of army staff position, against the wishes of both the army 
and the president. Considering Sharif's intentions a direct threat to 
his political authority, president Khan used his constitutional 
privilege as commander-in chief effectively to place his candidate, Gen 
Waheed, in the position.  

" Despite this setback, Nawaz Sharif intensified his political 
confrontation with Ghulam Ishaq Khan. 

The prime minister appealed for the renunciation of the Eighth 
constitutional Amendment (created under Zia in 1985), which conferred 
upon the president the power to dismiss the government. Khan, hopeful 
for a second five-year term, argued that the Eighth Amendment was an 
important barrier to the ambitions of the prime minister. 

" After PML chairman Junejo's death in March 1993, Sharif loyalists 
unilaterally nominated him as the next party leader. Consequently, the 
PML divided into the PML Nawaz (PML/N) group, loyal to the prime 
minister, and the PML Junejo group (PML/J), supportive of the president.

"In April 1993, president Khan, citing 'maladministration, corruption, 
and nepotism' and espousal of political violence, dismissed the Sharif 
government. The consequent interim government led by Balakh Sher Mazari 
experienced a problem of credibility because of allegations of 
corruption against its members.  

"The Supreme Court reinstated the Sharif regime in May l993. However, 
president Khan continued his efforts to subvert the government of prime 
minister Sharif by engineering the dissolution of the Punjab and NWFP 
assemblies. The continued confrontation between Sharif and Khan 
polarised Pakistani politics and threatened to undermine government 
institutions. Finally, under a compromise brokered by the military, both 
president Khan and prime minister Sharif resigned in July 1993. Wasim 
Sajjad, who was serving as Senate chairman, was appointed interim 
president.  

"An interim government, headed by Moeen Qureshi, a former World Bank 
vice president, took office with a mandate to hold national and 
provincial parliamentary elections in October. Despite its brief term, 
the Qureshi government adopted political, economic, and social reforms 
that generated considerable domestic support and foreign admiration.  

"In the October 1993 elections, the PPP won a plurality of seats in the 
National Assembly, and Benazir Bhutto was asked to form a government. 
However, because it did not acquire a majority in the National Assembly, 
the PPP's control of the government depended upon the continued support 
of numerous independent parties, particularly the PML/J. The 
unfavourable circumstances surrounding PPP rule-the imperative of 
preserving a coalition government, the formidable opposition of Nawaz 
Sharif's (PML/N) movement, and the insecure provincial administrations - 
presented significant difficulties for the government of Prime Minister 
Bhutto. On the other hand, the election of Prime Minister Bhutto's close 
associate, Farooq Leghari, as president in November 1993 gave her a 
stronger Dower base.  

" During the past 15 months in office, Prime Minister Bhutto's 
government has set out clear policies to deal with key Pakistani 
priorities, such as the economy, narcotics, and human rights. The 
government's economic plan received strong support from the 
international community in the form of an extended fund facility from 
the IMF in 1994. Pakistan promulgated comprehensive counter narcotics 
legislation in early 1995 and stepped up efforts to eradicate poppy 
production in the NWFP. In an effort to improve respect for human 
rights, the government created a human rights cell in the ministry of 
interior."

*<a name="poli">From  Press Gallery : A polite gesture lost</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick

WHEN the opposition leader Nawaz Sharif finally found some time from his 
hectic political schedule to speak on the budget, Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto was present in the House to lend him an ear. When he stood up to 
deliver his speech, Benazir and some of her ministers even thumped the 
desks, a gesture rarely shown in our parliament. And when the prime 
minister had to leave the hall midway through his she, again in a rare 
show of civility, wrote him a chit, seeking to be excused for her 
absence. However, this whole exercise in politeness had little effect on 
Nawaz Sharif whose response was less than generous. And the response of 
his otherwise well-mannered and soft-spoken information secretary, 
Mushahid Hussain, was even less so.

Ms Bhutto had come to the House thrice to listen to Mr Sharif's speech 
who, for reasons best known to him, did not open the general debate on 
the budget, as is customary. He chose last day of the general debate to 
make his speech and the prime minister specially came to the House to 
hear him.

Before taking her seat, she tried to exchange pleasantries with the 
opposition leader who pretended to be busy, ostensibly in reading some 
papers. The prime minister had to settle for an exchange of pleasantries 
with Gohar Ayub and Asfandyar Wali, who reciprocated.

Nawaz Sharif, who read out a 10 page prepared speech, attacked the 
fiscal policies of the government, though at times he would add a few 
remarks off the cuff before quickly reverting to the written text, 
obviously fearing he might loose his concentration. He did not succeed 
much, however, for, to the utter surprise of all of us in the Press 
Gallery, he read the entire page five of the speech twice.

The reporters thought he would soon realise his mistake and go on to the 
next page but that did not happen. The embarrassment of his party men 
only too obvious, as their leader galloped through the pages with 
amazing self-confidence.

"You never believed us that he (Sharif) cannot concentrate on an issue 
for more than five minutes, what do you say now after today's show?" was 
the caustic comment of one ruling party member.

When Mian Sahib was halfway through, the prime minister apparently 
remembered some engagement. But before leaving she left a chit at the 
desk of the opposition leader, who did not even as much as glance it, 
and said his speech was more important than the chit. "I will not read 
this chit," he declared.

Gohar Ayub, however, picked up the chit and read it. When Sharif was 
finished, he handed the piece of paper to him which he read.

As Benazir left the hall, a number of journalists left the gallery to 
talk to her but she refused to say anything. "She is missing out on a 
golden opportunity. She could have engaged us in a conversation and made 
it to the front pages tomorrow, overshadowing Nawaz Sharif," was how a 
senior colleague felt.

After Mr Sharif's speech, some journalists rushed to the opposition 
leader's chamber to know what the prime minister had scribbled on that 
piece of paper. Mushahid Hussain was there to make a fun of the gesture. 
"She has written, Mian Sahib I love you," he quipped.

He also uttered some unprintables about why Gohar Ayub had picked up the 
chit.

However, finally it came to be known that Ms Bhutto had written: "Came 
here to listen to your speech. Leaving for certain pre-engagement. Hope 
to see you again."

Meanwhile, the general debate on budget which ended today, had been 
tough for the ruling party members and the reporters alike. The PPP 
members were prohibited by the prime minister to visit the cafeteria 
while their absence was killing for the columnists who pick up a lot of 
information and gossip, both printable and otherwise, from them over a 
cup of tea. During their absence it was journalists versus journalists, 
debating issues and getting nowhere.

*From  Press Gallery : <a name="over">Karachi overshadows budget</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD: The budget lost its relevance as Karachi overshadowed the 
proceedings when the National Assembly met on Saturday after a day's 
recess. The killing of 35 people in Karachi at the hands of 
"terrorists", till the afternoon, had shaken up the treasury and 
opposition members alike.

Political expediencies were overcome by national interest, and members 
realised that any further delay in controlling the situation could take 
matters to a point-of-no- return. The horrifying experience of 1971 in 
East Pakistan has not been washed from the memories and every member was 
speaking from his heart to save Pakistan, the approach though was 
different.

The government's concern was reflected in the Prime Minister's talk with 
the reporters whom she had herself invited to her chamber where she only 
talked about Karachi. When a journalist asked her about her uneasy 
relationship with Punjab Chief Minister Manzooor Wattoo, she was 
undoubtedly irritated as Karachi is her first priority, though she still 
is not ready to give in to the demands of MQM, which she terms " a 
terrorist organisation."

A ruling party member said when the Punjab issue was raised by some 
party MNAs during their meeting with the Prime Minister, she told them 
that she was too occupied with Karachi, her first and last priority for 
the present.

But Ms Bhutto's tone towards Altaf Hussain remained unchanged as were 
her conditions for dialogue. "Lay arms, surrender the wanted people and 
come for a dialogue," she repeated. But what she did not tell the 
reporters were the government plans to hold an in camera session of the 
National Assembly where it would take the members into confidence about 
the" involvement of MQM and other terrorist groups in Karachi killings." 
This piece of information was perhaps held up for being announced inside 
the House by Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar.

What Ms Bhutto said for the first time was that if it was true that 
Altaf Hussain had talked about an armed struggle in Pakistan she would 
take up the issue with the British government.

There was no indication that she is ready to talk with Altaf Hussain 
without pre-conditions, not realising that many of her party members are 
in favour of a dialogue but cannot dare annoy her.

"We respect her political acumen but she has to realise the ground 
situation," an MNA from Punjab said after the parliamentary meeting of 
the PDF alliance which was presided at by the Prime Minister and where 
she took the same stand. "Think of the miseries of the people living in 
Karachi, how long they can bear this situation."

The fear that the situation in Karachi can spill over to other provinces 
where the bodies of police and paramilitary people killed by " 
terrorists" in Karachi have started arriving, has gripped the MNAs from 
Punjab and NWFP particularly. These killings can create hatred against a 
particular community, which has no role in terrorism, and thus achieve 
the nefarious objectives of the "terrorists."

Deputy Opposition Leader Gohar Ayub mentioned at least two people in his 
area whose bodies arrived recently from Karachi.

A consensus was found in the House during debate on Karachi that 
something urgent should be done while rising above party politics. The 
debate, allowed on points of orders and in which more than 50 members 
*from  the two sides took part, was serious and unlike the past the 
members acted responsibly. Even Federal Minister for Law N.D.Khan, who 
is good at provoking the opposition, spoke maturely.

While the opposition remained adamant that the government should contact 
Altaf Hussain for dialogue and withdraw cases against MQM workers, it 
simultaneously condemned "terrorism" in Karachi.

For the first time Achakzai found himself in a difficult position where 
he could neither support the MQM nor the government. On one hand, he 
said Altaf Hussain was not as big a leader as he claims, yet he also 
advised the government to initiate dialogue with him. He said that at 
least half of Karachi's population was neither Mohajir nor Sindhi and 
any solution ignoring them would not work.

"Altaf's extremism is that he considers himself the king of entire 
Karachi, (which he is not)," Achakzai said but in the same breath he 
said that there was no way to overcome the problem other than by 
initiating a dialogue as he represents a big community. "I personally 
don't consider him a very big personality." He also criticised the 
government for " crushing violence through state terrorism." What 
perhaps he wanted to say and did not was that the city should be 
redemarcated so that various communities living in Karachi get a 
proportional representation in the city.

Ijazul Haq, the son of former dictator Gen Zia-ul-Haque, perhaps still 
relished the memory of good old days when his father ruled this country 
against the wishes of the people. "If parliament does not take this 
issue seriously, the undemocratic forces, which are (always) ready to 
take democratic decisions, will be ready once again to act," he warned.

The scion of a martial law dictator, Ijaz was perhaps trying to justify 
the undemocratic decision of his father, who is considered to be the 
mentor of the MQM.

But Gohar Ayub was justified in agitating against the government's 
failure to name its party members on the National Assembly Committee on 
Karachi. The committee was formed through a joint resolution but the 
government has not yet named its people, thus deliberately delaying its 
formation. What the government wants to achieve by delaying the 
formation of the committee is unclear. The committee, having equal 
representation from the government and the opposition side, would have 
shown its sincerity in solving the aggravating situation.

Better late than never. The government should announce the names of its 
members on the committee so that at least its sincerity is not 
questioned by the opposition as well as the public.

Regarding the in-camera session, it has yet to be seen whether the 
government will be able to convince the opposition about the involvement 
of the MQM in the incidents of Karachi.

ISLAMABAD: The opposition was callous in its bid to score political 
points over Karachi issue. It wasted almost the entire day demanding 
suspension of rules to discuss Karachi situation and did not agree to 
the government's suggestion that it withdraw its cut motions, pass the 
budget and discuss Karachi for the remaining three days.

Karachi was discussed in the House just two days back when more than 50 
members spoke on the subject. Since then the killings have only 
increased or one could assume that the assembly had to make any 
worthwhile contribution to improving the situation.

Mahmood Achakzai, who is self-styled champion of rule of law, was 
playing a front man's role for the opposition, advocating the bypassing 
of the rules and procedures which clearly say that no business can be 
taken up during the budget session. Even the debate allowed by the 
speaker the other day on points of order was contrary to the rules.  

Deputy opposition leader and former speaker Gohar Ayub even tried to 
mislead the House by claiming that he had suspended the rules during the 
budget session in 1992 when a similar situation had arisen in Karachi. 

But Raza Rabbani called the bluff and when the record was brought 
to the House on his insistence, it was revealed that the rules were 
never suspended and the debate was included on the agenda of the day in 
violation of procedure.

Everybody on the opposition seemed to forget that it was during its 
tenure in the government that the army was sent to Karachi. Similarly, 
most of the cases against MQM workers and leaders were registered during 
its tenure. And when Chaudhry Nisar declared that the cases had been 
registered on the orders of the former army chief Asif Nawaz, wasn't he 
admitting that Nawaz Sharif was only a pawn in the hands of those who 
were actually running the affairs of the country.  

Chaudhry Nisar also informed the House that at one stage the MQM had 
agreed to hand over at least six "terrorists" from its ranks to the 
government. One failed to understand whether Nisar was favouring the MQM 
or confirming its involvement in acts of terrorism, which it denies even 
today.

The opposition members kept on proclaiming that the budget was of little 
consequence compared to the Karachi situation, but were not willing to 
withdraw the cut motions. Their main demand was to hold an immediate 
debate followed by a joint session of parliament after the budget to 
discuss the Karachi situation. The government and the speaker were ready 
to agree to a debate provided the opposition withdrew their cut motions. 
However, on the issue of a joint session, it was not ready to make a 
commitment.

The open offer of the ministers to the opposition for initiating a 
serious dialogue and its request for cooperation on Karachi was not 
reciprocated.  
Speaker Yousaf Raza Gilani was in the most difficult situation trying to 
balance himself on a tight rope. He was not willing to violate the rules 
and simultaneously trying to appease the opposition.

When Gohar Ayub misquoted the precedence, he at once announced that if 
there was a precedence he would allow the opposition to move its 
resolution seeking suspension of the rules.

Deputy Law Minister Raza Rabbani, could hardly veil his annoyance with 
Gilani. "There is also a precedence of passing a constitutional 
amendment in 12 minutes when Gohar Ayub was the speaker, will you follow 
that, too? " he shouted. "It was an irregularity committed by the then 
government which was acceded to by the then speaker," Rabbani said 
referring to the Karachi debate which was held in 1992 during the budget 
session. But the speaker had already made up  his mind not to take the 
blame of disallowing a debate on Karachi and easily shifted it to the 
treasury benches by allowing Achakzai to move the resolution for 
suspending the business.

Achakzai, instead of reading a simple resolution calling for the 
suspension of the rules to discuss the Karachi situation, tried to play 
with words to give an impression as if the resolution was meant to call 
for a joint sitting of parliament, but his move was pre-empted by the 
speaker who did not allow him to go any further. Though the move was 
rejected by the majority vote in the first place but the opposition 
called for a division during which the resolution was defeated by 106 to 
57 votes. The opposition staged a token walk out as a protest.

Interestingly opposition leader Nawaz Sharif who attended both the 
morning and afternoon sessions, did not utter a word on Karachi.

Some parliamentary observers felt that the PML's insistence on convening 
a joint session of parliament betrayed a lingering fear its much-
trumpeted conference on Karachi might not create the impact it desires 
in the absence of the PPP and veteran leaders like Nawabzada Nasrullah 
Khan, Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi and Maulana Fazalur Rehman.

A joint session could also provide an opportunity to the MQM which is 
not represented in the National Assembly but has a few senators, to 
present its side of the story, which the opposition hoped would 
embarrass the government.

But Sharif is faced with a dilemma. He had assured Altaf Hussain that he 
would get the Karachi seats vacated by his partymen to pave the way for 
holding fresh elections but he has not been able to convince his MNAs to 
resign. And there is every fear that this issue would crop up at the 
Karachi conference and the PML might find itself in quite a spot.
