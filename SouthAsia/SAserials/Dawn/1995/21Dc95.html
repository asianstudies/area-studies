DIES IN CUSTODY: An MQM man, who was being interrogated for the murder 
of two sons of a senior police officer, died in custody.

Mohammad Ehsanul Qadir, had been in police custody for the last five

<a name="alta">Altaf wants replies on relative deaths</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Dec. 16: MQM leader Altaf Hussain has called on the president, 
the prime minister, the interior minister, the governor and the chief 
minister of Sindh to reply to the points he has raised about deaths of 
his elder brother and nephew whose bodies were found on Dec. 9 in 
Gadap. He asked the federal and the provincial governments why they 
were denying any responsibility for the deaths of two of his relatives 
who were "taken away from their house in the presence of witnesses by 
police and men in an armoured vehicle."

Mr Hussain said an FIR should be registered on the basis of a written 
statement about the killings, which was handed over to the SHO, 
Gulberg. 

After the arrest of Nasir Hussain, Altaf Hussain's elder brother, the 
deputy leader of opposition in the Sindh Assembly, Bukhari, had 
informed the president and the chief justices of the Supreme Court and 
Sindh High Court, appealing to them to save the life of Mr Nasir and 
his son. The convenor of the MQM coordination committee, Ishtiaq Azhar 
had issued a statement to the Press and the AFP news agency had quoted 
police sources "confirming the arrests". But on Dec. 8 the rangers in 
a Press statement had not only denied these arrests but also absolved 
the police from such action.

According to a Press release faxed to Dawn, Mr Hussain expressed 
surprise over the advocacy by the rangers of the police and said on 
previous occasions they had not issued any such clarifications. The 
denial, appeared to him, to be part of a "pre- meditated plan".

Mr Hussain asked why the rangers had increased their patrol and were 
suddenly put on alert in Karachi on Dec. 9 if they or any other 
official agency was not responsible for the arrest of his brother and 
nephew. "Why was a pre arranged visit to Orangi by the prime minister 
suddenly cancelled? Why, for the first time, the photographs of the 
bodies of the two persons were released to the newspapers by the 
police? Why was no post-mortem done and why the bodies were handed to 
the Edhi Centre without ascertaining the time and cause of death? Why 
was a guard placed at the Edhi Centre?" Mr Hussain asked.

<a name="mqmf">MQM files rejoinder in Supreme Court</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, Dec. 16: The MQM has filed a 3,920-page, 80-volume rejoinder 
in an attempt to controvert the governments written statement in 
reply to its petition in the Supreme Court.

It claims that the government is more keen on propaganda than on 
judicial proceedings. The MQM said the statement is being circulated 
worldwide, particularly at the United Nations, at the taxpayers 
expense only to score propaganda points without addressing the real 
constitutional issues involved.

The rejoinder also alleges that 80 per cent of the government reply 
consists of newspaper clippings haphazardly covering a seven-year 
period from 1985 to 1992.

It is further claimed that 20 per cent of the statement is comprised 
police and intelligence reports which are not admissible in evidence 
in the court even of a magistrate.

It says that all self-incriminatory or confessional statements are 
unconstitutional and illegal unless recorded in accordance the 
Criminal Procedure Code.

The rejoinder cites the statements of US public representatives and 
officials, resolutions of the British House of Commons, reports of 
Amnesty International and other human rights organisations, and news 
and analyses carried by The New York Times, The Washington Post, The 
Guardian, The Independent  and other newspapers in support of its 
claim that it enjoys popular backing and electoral strength and its 
allegations of extra-judicial killings and extortion by agencies in 
Karachi.

the police department was responsible for giving the details of cases 
against Irshad Rehmani.

LONDON, Dec. 18: MQM leader Altaf Hussain has protested against what 
he has described as the use of extra force by law enforcement agencies

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 19: MQM chief negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi said that his 
party was ready to resume talks with the government provided 
suppression of the MQM and killing of its workers were stopped 
forthwith.

Mr Dehlavi said the MQM negotiation team had received a reply to its 
letter after 40 days from the government. Under the circumstances, he 
said, the President himself would be justified in determining who was 
at fault.

He said MQM was ready to play its role for the restoration and 
maintenance of peace in the megalopolis if the government refrained 
from committing atrocities against the MQM.

Mr Dehlavi asked the President what he was doing to save the country 
from a colossal loss when the president of the Karachi Stock Exchange, 
Siraj Casim, had briefed him about Rs 100 billion loss owing to the 
Karachi situation.

He said, during the current year, 2,000 persons had been killed 
because of state terrorism and therefore the government had lost the 
right to rule.

Despite all atrocities committed by the state machinery, he said, the 
MQM was ready to hold negotiations with the President in all earnest 
desire for peace in the city.

establishment of police pickets in thickly populated areas of Faqir Ka

genocide of MQM workers and Haq Parast people.

criminals and on that pretext the agencies attacked these areas and 
held the people hostages.
    
He said although the government had propagated that the action was 
being taken against hardened criminals, no criminal had been arrested 
so far and added that those who had looted the property and money of 
the people had escaped under the shelter of police.
    
He termed the onslaught of police in these densely populated areas a 
result of manipulation between criminals and police to start massacre 
of the innocent Haq Parast people.
    
He also alleged that the police were conducting house-to-house search 
and humiliating women and children and added that innocent people who 
were being arrested during searches were being subjected to inhuman 
torture.
    
He warned that if the government did not stop raids and arrests of 
innocent persons, the entire city will be compelled to resort to 
protest.

<a name="repl">Reply to PMs letter : Nawaz again demands mid-term polls</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 14 : Mr Sharif replied to Ms Bhuttos letter written 
to him on December 10, copy of which was also circulated to the Press, 
in which he has conditioned his meeting with the prime minister to the 
holding of mid- term elections  a demand she has already rejected.
    
It is my opinion that the country cannot get out of the serious 
economic mess, political crisis and the alarming Karachi situation 
without going back to the electorate through fresh elections coupled 
with basic constitutional and legal reforms. I am sure this is not too 
high a price to rid the country of this malaise and put Pakistan back 
on the rails, he said in his letter.
    
The opposition leader pointed out that the constitutional package 
should not be confined to the removal of the Eighth Amendment and the 
restoration of women seats, but it should also cover other important 
issues such as floor crossing, independence of the judiciary, setting 
up of an independent and high- powered judicial commission for 
eradicating corruption, and constitutional guarantees for free and 
fair elections.
 
I am surprised that despite such massive failures on every front, the 
government should still insist on completing its five- year tenure. 
The country, in my view, will simply not be able to bear a 
continuation of this misrule much longer, Mr Sharif asserted.
    
He said he appreciated the prime ministers anxiety to restore the 
faltering credibility of the government in the face of growing 
political and economic crisis in the country.

<a name="allp">All packed up and nowhere to go!</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick

DRIVING back from a public meeting recently, Nawaz Sharif turned to a 
top PML leader accompanying him and asked about the means to take 
this mass contact movement to its logical conclusion. When asked 
about what he perceived as being the logical conclusion, the leader of 
the opposition reportedly looked askance at the man and retorted 
rather sharply: If I knew that, I would have figured out the means as 
well.

Unbelievable as it may sound, it is but true that Nawaz has lunged, 
head first, into a nation-wide campaign to whip up anti- government 
sentiment without any concrete plans for the next phase. The 
unsettling reality from the oppositions perspective, is that its top 
leadership does not have the foggiest idea of what comes next.

There is no denying that Nawaz has been getting a good response in 
terms of public turnouts etc, but for that he must thank the 
governments losses more than any of his own political gains.

And it is this very lack of direction and the want of a clearly 
chalked-out political strategy that seems to be crippling the working 
of the opposition at one of those rare times in the present tenure of 
Benazir government, where the government is betraying signs of playing 
nervously on a somewhat weaker political wicket.

There is little doubt about the government feeling the growing 
pressures. Karachi continues to defy all government writ, law and 
order situation is generally alarming, economy is in a virtual mess 
and inching along on a month-by-month basis on IMF funded trances, 
while the question of announcing the successor in Rawalpindi is 
contributing in its own silently disturbing manner. Everyday there are 
rumours about the packing up of the system and unfortunately ours has 
been a proven track record of rumours turning into reality.

In this background, the prime ministers latest letter to Nawaz 
generated a lot of debate in the opposition ranks. As one senior PML 
leader suggested, opposition always has the edge because it has no 
record to be judged against. It just has to point out the governments 
shortcomings and wait for it to blunder. Opposition never wins an 
election, its the government that loses it. Nawaz was also advised 
to desist from scaring away the government by making early elections a 
pre-condition for any political dialogue.

While incorporating almost all other recommendations regarding the 
extension of the negotiation agenda to include other items like floor 
crossing, judicial independence etc, Nawaz could not resist his hawks 
pressure to add the pre-condition of early polls for the holding of 
any serious dialogue. As expected, the two sides have retreated to 
their old rigid positions.

Could it be that the leader of the opposition may have gained heart 
from the latest gossip to trickle out of the PM house according to 
which the Atchison educated Pir of the prime minister has reportedly 
told her that if the next elections were held in November of 1996, she 
would win another term in office. Judging from the present economic 
mess and growing public antipathy, one wonders whose side the Pir 
sahib is really on?.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 17: The PML has set up a three-member anti-corruption 
committee to expose the alleged loot and plunder of the ruling 
party.
    
The PPP has siphoned away at least Rs50 billion from the public 
exchequer, Khawaja Mohammad Asif who heads the committee, told a 
press conference.
    
The committee will take cognisance of each and every case where 
misuse or loot of the public exchequer is involved. Mr Asif said the 
reluctance of the government to constitute such a parliamentary 
committee to check the increasing corruption had prompted the 
opposition to set up this committee.

Mr Asif appealed to the general public to inform his committee of any 
incident of corruption they might come across in any public sector 
department or organisation.

KARACHI, Dec. 19: MNA Mian Ejaz Shafi has urged the prime minister to 
accept realities instead of levelling baseless charges against the 
leader of the opposition, Nawaz Sharif.

He expressed concern over the situation in Karachi and said under a 
well-planned move the government was penalising people for not 
supporting the PPP. Extra-judicial killings, raids, siege of 
localities and arrests of a number of people was a proof of revenge 
of the ruling party, he added.

Bribery and corruption were being encouraged. Even the people were 
deprived of basic amenities, including water supply, and there was no 
security of life, he said.

He alleged that rulers after emptying government coffers were 
collecting money from the people through introduction of bonds.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 19: Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif welcomed the 
appointment of Gen Jehangir Karamat as the new Chief of the Army 
Staff, and paid tributes to Gen Abdul Waheed Khan for not accepting 
the extension of one year in his service.

The PML chief said that General Waheed has taken a right decision and 
hoped his decision would go a long way in encouraging the growth of 
professionalism in the armed forces of Pakistan.

Mr Sharif said he welcomed the decision because it had at last ended 
the state of uncertainty that was created as a result of what he 
described as quite unnecessary delay in this announcement, which had 
generated rumours on a massive scale with detrimental effects for the 
political and economic stability of the country.

However, he hoped that the stalled talks would resume soon. He said 
that the PML and MQM in particular should not see the Karachi issue in 
political background and should make efforts to restore peace in 
Karachi and Sindh.

Mr Leghari, who spoke mostly extempore on the Karachi situation, said 
there was no other option but to include the MQM in the system. He 
said the MQM should help the government curb terrorism. They should 
hunt out terrorist groups in Karachi whether they belong to drug Mafia 
or other.

Mr Leghari said local bodies elections could be held within six months 
provided peace was restored to the violence-hit city. Within three 
months, rest of the things can be settled. He also mentioned that he 
was in favour of local bodies elections.

<a name="crit">Leghari criticises WB for opposing big dams</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 18: President Farooq Leghari criticised the World Bank 
for opposing the construction of big dams and instead supporting 
thermal power generation which was a threat to the environment.

President Farooq Leghari strongly supported the hydel power 
generation, which he said was more suitable for Pakistan which has 
huge untapped hydel resources.

President Farooq Leghari said the World Bank was itself supporting 
electricity generation through thermal and coal-fired plants and has 
set up a fund for this purpose.

The president said Pakistan was against all such projects which are 
environment unfriendly. President Leghari said We are happy that they 
(World Bank) are supporting Ghazi Barotha hydel power generation 
project yet they should also consider helping the developing countries 
in constructing big dams. He said every country has its own 
priorities. We must have wider alternatives and greater choices, he 
asserted. One choice is adoption of solar energy, he added.

He said there is distortion in the distribution of energy in the world 
because 25 per cent of the developed countries, which are consuming 
two-third of the electricity, were  denying transfer of technology to 
the developing countries.

He said the world was moving in a direction where there will be an 
immense clash of interest as the countries having knowledge and 
technologies are putting an embargo on them. Dissemination of 
knowledge should be encouraged.

He said countries like France fulfil 80 per cent of their energy 
requirements from nuclear power generation whereas this technology is 
denied to the developing countries. For many countries, nuclear energy 
will be a more viable option. What I am pleading is availability of 
choices.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

LAHORE, Dec. 14: The PML opposition created pandemonium in the 
provincial assembly when Acting Speaker Mian Manzoor Mohal dismissed 
its plea to table a resolution condemning the arrest of its leader 
Shahbaz Sharif and his alleged torture by the FIA.
    
During a discussion on adjournment motions moved by provincial 
legislators during the first day of the opposition-requisitioned 
session, Acting Opposition Leader Chaudhry Parvez Elahi rose to 
request the chair to suspend all rules to take up the PMLs resolution 
on Mr Shahbaz Sharif.
    
Undeterred by shouts from the Treasury Benches, Mr Elahi started 
reading the text of the resolution despite the Chairs refusal to take 
up the matter. 
  
Mian Manzoor Mohal repeatedly said he would let the resolution be 
debated on Sunday, but the PML leader went ahead with his reading.
    
Other opposition members also rose to their feet, shouting anti -
government slogans and, led by Mr Elahi and Sirdar Zulfikar Khan 
Khosa, encircled the Speakers chair to press him to admit the 
resolution.
   
Mr Mohal politely asked them to return to their seats. You can convey 
the same thing from your places. Do not try to put pressure on me. I 
cannot allow something that is violative of the rules to happen in the 
House. 
  
The Leader of the Opposition and other members of the House are equal 
before me, and nobody can be permitted to invade the sanctity of the 
House, Mr Mohal told the Opposition.
    
The Opposition MPAs returned to their seats after a few minutes.
    
Mr Mohal agreed with a suggestion from PML MPA Zafar Ali Shah that the 
Leader of the Opposition and the Law Minister should sit together and 
evolve a consensus resolution as it was a harmless issue and 
pertained to the supremacy of political values, institutions and the 
Constitution and not Mr Sharif. The Acting Speaker directed the Law 
Minister to sit with Mr Elahi, formulate a joint resolution and 
present it to him before moving it in the house.

KARACHI, Dec. 14: Dr Farooq Sattar, the leader of the opposition in 
the Sindh Assembly, reiterated that opposition Haq Parast group would 
continue boycott of the assembly proceedings until the government 
discharged its obligations by facilitating the opposition and ensuring 
attendance of their detained colleagues.
    
He said, the government did not move as the government had reservation 
owing to exposure of torture inflicted on imprisoned MPAs at Adiala 
Jail for pressurising them to change their loyalty.
    
The leader of the opposition said that they had been implicated in a 
concocted case just to keep them at Adiala Jail for compelling them to 
change their loyalty.
    
Terming their confinement illegal he said the government itself was 
showing scant respect for the laws as their colleagues who had been 
facing some 70 cases in Karachi were not being brought on the dates of 
hearing nor they were being tried at the Adiala prison.
    
He said he himself had been brought from the prison after 65 days as 
he was not produced on the dates of hearing in any case before the 
trial court.
    
When his attention was drawn towards the law ministers stand that the 
opposition was not playing its role for which they were elected, he 
said when the government had not tolerated the opposition, how they 
could play any role. Its all efforts were to create non-conducive 
conditions for the opposition to keep them away from the assembly.

Bureau Report 

LAHORE, Dec. 17: The opposition in the Punjab Assembly said it had no 
confidence in acting Speaker Manzoor Mohal and boycotted the second 
day of the requisitioned session after proceedings lasting about 95 
minutes.

The boycott came after Mr Mohal refused permission to the opposition 
to table a resolution against alleged torture by the FIA on Mian 
Shahbaz Sharif, detained in Adiala Jail.

Before staging the walkout, the opposition members used derogatory 
language against Mr Mohal and acting opposition leader Chaudhry 
Pervaiz Elahi said that the opposition was expressing its no-
confidence in Mr Mohal and was boycotting the session.
    
He warned that if violence against opposition legislators was not 
checked, nobody would feel secure. Pakistan is, with the passage of 
time, degenerating into a graveyard of human rights.
    
Mr Mohal remained unmoved by all these arguments and he said since no 
joint resolution could be drafted, as was agreed upon earlier, he 
would not allow the opposition to table it unilaterally.
    
The opposition staged a walkout and the acting speaker started 
disposing of privilege motions by the opposition members. Rawalpindis 
Chaudhry Muhammad Riaz returned to House for a short while to request 
Mr Mohal that since his party was staying away, his privilege motion 
should be kept pending.

The chair turned down the request.
    
When the House continued to lack quorum even after that he adjourned 
the session for half-an-hour. After that he adjourned it sine die.

LARKANA, Dec. 19: Sindh National Front chief Mumtaz Ali Bhutto has 
said the laws passed in hurry and in violation of the rules and 
regulations in the Sindh Assembly by the treasury benches where the 
opposition members were not allowed to express their views could be 
challenged.

He said the PA was meeting only to fulfil the constitutional 
requirements, where already promulgated ordinances of governor were 
being shaped as laws.

Mr Bhutto regretted that a proposal placed in the House four times by 
him and Syed Muzaffar Hussain Shah for making a facts- finding 
committee to explore the factors responsible for the ever-worsening 
law and order situation in the province, remained unheeded.

The government was evading to discuss the issues of sky- rocketing 
prices of essential commodities, growing unemployment, law and order, 
ever-increasing corruption and the police atrocities, Mr Bhutto said.

He said the Speaker had rejected his 10 proposals out of 14 which 
spoke volumes for the commitments towards promulgating laws by PPP 
government.

He, however, did invite the opposition to cooperate with the 
government in repealing all black laws and to help find ways to stop 
violations of basic human rights.

According to oppositions perspective, the MPOs are nothing more than 
tools for victimising the political opposition.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 19: The Brown Amendment appears to have been caught 
in a deadly crossfire over the abortion issue and unless Pakistan 
lobbied hard and fast on the Hill, it may well get buried with the

These experts say if Pakistan did not succeed in detaching the Brown 
Amendment from the Foreign Aid Bill and missed the opportunity to tag 
it on to the new law being considered for Israel, the whole issue may 
get bogged down for months because then the Foreign Operations Bill 
would remain hostage to the abortion issue as long as it was not 
resolved.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 20: Pakistan has threatened that it will appropriately 
respond to the Indian missile programme within the MTCR regime and 
stated that Islamabad had no reason to accept the Indian denial of 
the American press reports that it was preparing its second nuclear 
explosion (soon) at Pokharan in Rajasthan, close to Pakistans Sindh 
border. The first one was in 1974.

foreign ministers of South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation 
(SAARC) in New Delhi, said at a news briefing on Wednesday evening 
that he found little credibility in the statement of Indian Foreign 
Minister Parnab Mukherji that India had no intention of developing a 
nuclear weapon. India had more often than not shifted its position on 
the nuclear and other such issues.
    
The minister avoided responding directly to a question whether 
Pakistan, too, would carry out a nuclear explosion in case India went 
ahead with its, but warned that the consequences of the Indian nuclear 
explosion would be entirely on India which he alleged had killed the 
Simla Agreement.

LAHORE, Dec. 19: The World Bank has sent the government a set of 
guidelines in the light of which statutes for the new authorities are 
to be drafted. The staff to be recruited for the commissions or 
authorities would be approved by the World Bank as also their 
statutes. The bank has offered the services of various companies in 
the drafting of the statutes.

The World Bank has also asked the government to remove 30 per cent 
employees of the irrigation department who the bank thinks are 
surplus.

Punjab government sources were of the view that the pattern proposed 
by the World Bank for converting the irrigation department into 
autonomous authorities was different from the impression President 
Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari had given.

The sources pointed out that the Mexico pattern, as suggested by the 
World Bank, was not suitable for Pakistan. In Mexico, it is said, 
water and land were delinked while in Pakistan the situation was the 
exact opposite of this.

Pakistani farmers, the sources said, were not in a position to buy 
water from water markets to irrigate their crops as will be the case 
if the World Bank guidelines were followed.

report and sent it to the State Department in Washington on the 
current political and economic situation in Pakistan.
    
The report pointed out that the political situation in Pakistan would 
remain highly uncertain till the appointment of a new army chief, 
General Abdul Waheed, the present COAS, will be retiring in January.
    
It talked about the law and order situation in Pakistan due to which 
foreign investors were hesitant to risk their investment. 

The findings of the US officials particularly mentioned the growing 
incidents of subversion and terrorism in Karachi. 

However, the report said, that the PPP government was using all 
possible means to control that situation. The report, nevertheless, 
pointed out that without initiating dialogue with MQM, no lasting 
peace could be achieved in Karachi and that all the political forces 
should facilitate talks between the government and the MQM headed by 
Altaf Hussain.
    
Sources said the report termed economic situation not very good but 
appreciated various efforts being made by Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto to improve it with the help of the IMF and the World Bank.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 14: In a rapidly changing political scenario and the 
ongoing violence in Karachi, former chief minister of Sindh, Mumtaz 
Bhutto, has suddenly emerged as an important factor who could 
contribute in bridging the gap between rural and urban Sindhis, 
political sources said.

Great importance is being attached to his unscheduled and surprise 
meeting with the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto earlier this week and 
subsequently with the chief MQM negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi.
    
Mr Bhutto, met the chief MQM negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi at his office to 
condole the death of Altaf Hussains brother and nephew and 
exchanged views on matters of mutual interest.
    
Mr Dehlavi said that during conversation with Mr Bhutto he did mention 
about the MQMs grievances and problems being faced by the community.

<a name="emba">Embassy blast financier: wife speaks of harassment</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 14: The alleged financier of the Egyptian embassy bomb 
blast in Islamabad, a Canadian national running a non-governmental 
organisation inside Afghanistan, crossed into Pakistan on Dec. 2 and 
not on Dec. 3 as claimed by Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar on the 
floor of the National Assembly, his wife claimed.
    
Saeed Ahmad Khadr, of Egyptian origin, was also not arrested while 
crossing the border but had gone to the police station to know why the 
police had been harassing his family during his absence abroad, 38-
year-old Maha Elsamna told reporters outside the Canadian embassy.
    
Ms Elsamna said her detained husband, who is regional director of a 
Canada-based NGO, Human Concern International, had returned from 
Afghanistan on Dec. 2 and went to the police the following day to 
complain about a raid on their home in Peshawar five days earlier.
    
Ms Elsamna said that the entire family was taken to the police station 
where they were kept for two hours before being set free.
    
When her husband returned from Afghanistan on Dec. 2, she informed him 
about the raid, adding that on Dec. 3 her husband went to the police 
station to complain about the raid but never returned.
    
Does a criminal go to the police station by himself? she asked. The 
next day I read about the arrest of some alleged financier of the 
Egyptian embassy blast.
    
Ms Elsamna said the police twice raided her house on Dec. 4, a day 
after her husbands detention, and ransacked it. They took away their 
passports, 10,000 dollars in cash and the Afghan currency meant for 
the NGOs staff salaries.
    
She said they had been living in Peshawar for the last 10 years but 
had never involved themselves in politics because they were doing 
relief work.
    
Ms Elsamna said she was neither being informed about the whereabouts 
of her husband nor whether he was being tortured or why he was 
arrested.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CAIRO, Dec. 15: An underground militant group threatened reprisals 
against Pakistan if it extradites more fundamentalists to Egypt the 
Talaeh al-Fatah (Vanguard of the Conquest) warned, in a statement 
published in the London-based Arab newspaper Al-Hayat.

The group also warned Egypt against hunting militants abroad.

Pakistan have extradited to Egypt some 15 alleged militants since the 
start of 1994, according to Egyptian police.

But the interior ministry on Thursday denied a report in Al-Hayat that 
Pakistan had also extradited an Egyptian with Canadian nationality 
suspected of involvement in the bombing of Egypts embassy in 
Islamabad.

Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Dec. 15: Expressing concern over the prevailing situation in 
the country, the provincial chief of Awami National Party (ANP), Begum 
Nasim Wali Khan, has said the rulers are conspiring to create the 
1970-like situation which caused division of Pakistan.
    
The ANP leader called upon the people to rise and overthrow the 
Benazir government which, if it was allowed to continue longer, would 
divide Pakistan and its people. She said her appeal was directed 
towards all - Punjabis, Pathans, Sindhis and Balochs.
    
Terming Kalabagh dam as a dead horse, the ANP chief warned those who 
were trying to give a new life to it were not well wishers of 
Pakistan.
    
Another ANP leader, Haji Ghulam Ahmed Bilour, in his speech, said 
majority of the population remained unrepresented in the assemblies 
which called for fresh elections. He held the present rulers 
responsible for the Karachi situation.

<a name="thep">The Press and the PM</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

NO-ONE can deny that all is not well with the Press. Our newspapers 
are far behind the developed countries qualitatively and 
quantitatively. In my view, the English language has been the main 
reason why we have not been able to develop a truly national Press 
since independence.
    
English is, without doubt, a great language. Paradoxically, however, 
while it was the language of liberation during the struggle for 
independence, today, it has become an instrument of exploitation. The 
fruits of independence have been reaped by the tiny English-speaking 
minority which replaced the Sahibs immediately after they left.
 
English should have continued to inspire liberal, democratic ideas. 
Editorial writers, columnists still continue to espouse the liberal, 
democratic traditions, but who reads them or cares for them? It is the 
Urdu Press which should have given the lead in this regard.
    
Martial law brought all serious discussion to an end. Fighting against 
losing circulations, the Urdu papers began giving in to 
sensationalism, to publishing trite statements from men of no 
importance. The race for readership obliged Urdu newspapers to use 
juicier and juicier headlines, to employ more and more colourful 
language, especially in crime reports.
    
The prime minister has been extremely harsh in her criticism of the 
Press in recent weeks. While some of her remarks are well deserved by 
us of the Fourth Estate, one must say that she has been a bit too 
sweeping in her condemnation of journalism and journalists.
    
But I will not commit the same sin by being equally sweeping in my 
rebuttal of her charge that newspapers are packs of lies, and that no-
one should believe a word of what they write. Governments, especially 
Pakistani governments, tend to become increasingly intolerant of 
dissent when they begin to get into trouble. Now, Ms. Bhutto is in 
plenty of trouble both at home and abroad. And she is reacting just 
like her father did. I wont go into details. Everyone knows them. 
Suffice it to say that Mr Bhutto ordered the arrest of more newsmen 
and the closure of more magazines than any other government before or 
since, civil or military.
    
Mercifully, she has not yet begun ordering the arrest of newsmen or 
closing down of newspapers. But who knows? Anyway, my submission to 
her is that by turning her back on ugly reality, it will not vanish, 
she herself will.
    
Our newspapers may sensationalise things, but they still reflect the 
situation on the ground. For instance, Mr Altaf Husains elder brother 
and nephew were killed in Karachi. Were they not, and should the Press 
have blacked the news out?
    
Are prices not rising? Or are they just jumping for joy?

Did Mr Kharal not call Mr Nawaz Sharif a RAW agent? Principled 
politics leads to principled journalism and not vice-versa.
    
Have no stove burst deaths taken place anywhere in Pakistan? Has 
Pakistans trade imbalance not soared past $1.7 billion in the five 
months of the current fiscal year?
    
Are standards of education not falling every minute?
    
Was there no bomb explosion at the Egyptian embassy in Islamabad?

Is the law and order situation not worse than ever?

Is our population not exploding at a fearful rate?

Has not continued violence in Karachi dealt a stunning blow to the 
economy and driven away prospective foreign investors?

This was just a random sample of the lies the Press has been 
spreading lately. So Madame prime minister, if the state of the nation 
is ugly, the Press cannot make it beautiful; only politicians can. 
There cant be a developed Press in a developing country which has yet 
to attain any degree of political maturity. In any civilised country, 
the type of accusations Mr Kharal hurls at Mian Nawaz Sharif would 
have earned him a thousand libel suits.

On its part, the Press deserves to evolve a voluntary code of conduct 
of its own. It is time we stopped printing libellous matter. (It is 
already against the law, but regretfully, nobody seeks legal 
remedies). Once this code has been evolved, there should be an 
institutional apparatus to penalise a publication / violating it.

As for the print media, we do not know what the newspapers and 
magazines are writing in other regional countries. Apart from 
political barriers, there are lingual barriers.

The latter could be removed by establishing a publishing house in the 
public sector which should take out the same magazine in various 
regional languages plus, of course, English. Its staff should also be 
drawn from all regional countries, and it should be headquartered in 
Bangladesh.

I am insisting on single headquarters because they will bring people 
from all regions together in a joint effort for peace. 

The official media, especially in India and Pakistan, has been hacking 
at peace for all of fifty years and is now incapable of making peace 
out of pieces.

<a name="over">Overhead bridge : Lack of funds hampers work</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Saghir Ahmed

KARACHI, Dec. 14: Development work on the KDAs overhead railway 
bridge project at the main University Road has been hampered by 
inordinate delays caused by the non-availability of funds for 
shifting utility services from the site. Now, the actual work on the 
bridge is likely to begin next month.
    
Inquiries show that the World Bank, funding the project at 70:30 
ratio, had already released its share whereas the government share of 
30 per cent has yet to be received by the KDA. Although the government 
had recently ordered release of its share money but it has yet to come 
to the kitty of the KDA.
    
Since the project is already late and behind the schedule by a couple 
of months, it appears to be the cause of the main worry of the KDAs 
apprehension that the World Bank mission, which may arrive here any 
time to monitor the projects progress in the execution of the project 
schedule, may consider to suspend loan for lagging behind schedule.
    
The contractors also have shown their unrest over the delays which 
were contrary to the terms and conditions of the agreement.

QUETTA, Dec. 17: The Opposition Jamhoori Watan Party (JWP) demanded 
immediate dissolution of all the governments in centre and the 
provinces and the assemblies to pave the way for a new system 
reflective of the masses aspiration.
    
In a statement issued here the JWP considers as ineffective the 
validity of the present governments and assemblies which have pushed 
the country towards a dead tunnel.

The JWP said a new system should be devised after dissolving the 
present government and assemblies in order to ensure that it (system) 
became immune of flaws and deficiencies which has triggered the 
collapse of the present system.

The JWP believes the masses are at the brink of revolt against the 
present system and it would be better that it should be done away with 
in time by dismissing all the governments and the assemblies.

The party has also formed a seven-member committee to co-ordinate 
efforts with other like-minded to get rid of the present governments 
and the present system.

<a name="kara">Karamat named COAS</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 18: President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has appointed 
Lt. Gen. Jehangir Karamat, Chief of the General Staff, as the new 
Chief of Army Staff to succeed General Abdul Waheed who is scheduled 
to retire on January 12, 1996.

The nomination of Lt. Gen Karamat to the top most brings to an end the 
speculations, rife for the last two months, whether or not the 
government would succeed in convincing General Waheed to accept an 
extension of one year.

The out-going General is said to have declined the offer politely but 
agreed with the proposal to extend the tenure of the post of COAS to 
four years from the present three-year term.

Lt.Gen Jehangir Karamat is the senior most officer in the Pakistan 
Army, and therefore, he would be superseding none when he would take 
over as the COAS on January 12, 1996.

The COAS-designate called on President Leghari at Aiwan-i- Sadr and 
thanked him for the promotion and said he would do his utmost to serve 
the country and the nation to the best of his abilities.

He would be 11th chief of the Pakistan Army in the 48 years of the 
countrys history.

<a name="mini">Minister on the mat</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Habib Khan Ghori

KARACHI, Dec. 18: When the Sindh Assembly got down to work with 33 
members on the treasury benches, the journalists sitting in the Press 
gallery were expecting a lifeless session. But to the surprise of 
everyone, it turned out to be an exciting day despite the opposition 
members staying away.

This day was for questions pertaining to communications, works and 
transport departments. The transport minister went through the mill of 
supplementaries without any fuss as treasury members did not appear 
well versed about the department.

Parvez Ali Shah, who also is a senior minister, was embarrassed when 
all those MPAs who have been facing hardships in getting accommodation 
in the Sindh House, Islamabad, put him on the mat through a number of 
supplementaries. In most cases he had no satisfactory replies.

Every time he was caught on the wrong foot the speaker came to his 
rescue but the very next moment Dr Abdul Wahid Soomro took on him 
through another question.

Almost the entire hour was consumed by the three questions of Dr 
Soomro which were all about the affairs of the Sindh House.

In reply to Dr Soomros question, the minister informed the House that 
the total rent income received from the Sindh House from October 1993 
to September 10, 1995, was Rs 2,356,581.28 while expenditure during 
the year 1993-94 was Rs 8,246,235 and during the year 1994-95 was Rs 
9,528,443.0

As the law minister was not present, Syed Murad Ali Shah presented the 
two ordinances before the House which were on the agenda. Soon after 
laying of the ordinances, the law minister entered the House and 
presented two bills, No 23 and 24, for consideration.

Both the bills were passed by the Assembly.

Bureau Report

LAHORE, Dec. 19: WAPDA and Ghazi-Barotha Consortium signed contracts 
of Rs 15.9 billion for the construction of two components of 1450 MW 
hydropower project.

The contracts are for the construction of a barrage and a 52 KM long 
channel. The contracts for the barrage and the channel have been 
awarded to the Ghazi-Barotha Consortium which comprises of five 
contractors led by Impregile of Italy. Impregile was the main 
contractor of the consortium which had built the Tarbela Dam two 
decades ago.

Besides Impregile the Ghazi-Barotha Consortium has four other 
contractors namely, Zublin of Germany, Compenon Bernard of France, 
Saadullah Khan and Nazir and Company of Pakistan.

The barrage is estimated to cost Rs 5830 million and the channel Rs 
10,068 million. The World Bank has already made a commitment of 
providing 300 million dollars (about Rs 10 billion) for the channel. 
The Asian Development Bank will provide foreign exchange for the 
barrage. A team of Pakistani officers is busy these days holding 
negotiations with the ADB for the loan. 

Funds will also be provided by Japan, Germany, the Islamic Development 
Bank and European Investment Bank for the construction of the project 
which is now estimated to cost $2.16 billion (about Rs 70 billion).

phone, pay phone and pager companies to resume their operations in the

Mr Khan conceded that the ban was sending wrong signals 
internationally regarding the investment climate in the country. 
However, the security agencies contend that the ban helped them a lot 
in breaking the terrorist network in Karachi.
    
Mr.Feroze said he disagreed that the ban had helped in curbing 
terrorism in Karachi. He also said there were reports that terrorists 
were using E-mail, radio-based system of utility companies and other 
organisations like Karachi Electric Supply Corporation and Steel 
Mills, besides satellite phones, for communication.

Meet Sabz and Zaitooni.
Theyve been around for 180 million and would like to stay.

Can they?
Its up to you


Pakistan harbours 2 of the 7 species of turtles found in the world 
today.

For 180 million years, Sabz (Green Turtle) and Zaitooni (Olive Ridley 
Turtle) have come to Karachis beaches to lay their eggs. Sadly today 
Sabz and Zaitooni are in danger. Soon they may be extinct. Unless you 
help.

Once the eggs are laid, Sabz and Zaitooni returns to the sea. The eggs 
although camouflaged in a nest hole are threatened by predators; Every 
year fewer and fewer eggs  hatch. If this continues, none of Sabz and 
Zaitoonis eggs will hatch and they will disappear forever.

Are you going to allow this to happen?

Sabz and Zaitooni are a vital balancing link in our ecological system. 
They have brought colour and variety to our beaches. They are one of 
the most ancient vertebrate life forms in the world and play an 
important role in our understanding of nature.

Once Sabz and Zaitooni go they will never come back! 

To save Sabz and Zaitooni, more enclosures to protect their eggs have 
to be built and maintained. But we cannot manage alone.

We need your help to ensure that Sabz and Zaitooni stay.

So its up to you.

Please join us in saying ........

Facts on the Marine Turtles of Pakistan
Two species of marine turtles nest on Karachis beaches at Hawkesbay 
and Sandspit; the Green Turtle (Sabz Kachwa) and Olive Ridley 
(Zaitooni Ridley Kachwa).

The Green Turtle (Sabz Kachwa):
* Latin name: Chelonia Mydas
* Adult shell length: 90-110 cms
* Adult weight: 280-300 Ibs
* Food: Seaweed
* Nesting areas: Tropical & subtropical beaches around the world
* Interesting Fact: They are the only vegetarian species among marine 
turtles. It takes 12 to 15 years before they reach adulthood and 
return to nest. They have the highest commercial value for food among 
all sea turtles.

The Olive Ridley Turtle (Zaitooni Ridley Kachwa):
* Latin Name: Lepidochelys Olivacea
* Adult shell length: 70-75 cms
* Adult weight: 100-150 Ibs
* Food: molluscs
* Nesting areas: Costa Rica, India, Mexico and Pakistan
* Interesting Fact: The rarest and smallest among marine turtles.

How do turtles make a nest and by their eggs?
Coming ashore at night the female turtle digs a 3 feet deep hole with 
her powerful flippers. Once fixed in this depression she lays an 
average of 100 eggs. After laying the eggs she covers the hole with 
sand using both her front and rear flippers and then return to the 
sea.

What happens after the eggs hatch?
The eggs usually hatch after 40 to 60 days due to the heat from the 
sun and0 the chemical composition of the sand. Once they hatch they 
are attached to the brightest spot over the sea. If there are 
artificial lights the hatchlings are easily disoriented. They may then 
run inland and suffer exhaustion, desiccation, death by predators or 
accidents by vehicles on the road.

Why do Turtles Cry?
Turtles appear to shed tears when they come ashore to lay their eggs. 
In fact they are excreting excess salt from their bodies to maintain 
their physiological salt balance.

Why are Turtles disappearing from our Shores ?
All marine turtles species are in danger of extinction due to the 
following reasons:
- Commercial trade for turtle skins shells medicines and cosmetics.
- Destruction of the eggs by predators and poachers
- Accidental capture of turtles in fishing nets.
- Extensive shore-line development human disturbances and pollution.

Why Protect our Turtles ?
Turtles are known as the last of the worlds living dinosaurs. They 
first appeared on earth between 150 and 200 million years ago during 
the Triassic period. Their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Now 
if through negligence and greed we allow these magnificent animals to 
become extinct we will lose one of the most ancient vertebrate life 
forms in our world today.

<a name="60pc">60pc of revenue to go in debt servicing, claims Sartaj</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 16: Former finance minister and PML secretary- general 
Sartaj Aziz warned that Pakistan is sitting on the debt bomb whose 
timer has already started ticking. He particularly referred to the 
provision of Rs 157 billion made in the current fiscal years budget 
for debt servicing which represents over 60 per cent of the 
anticipated revenue collection.
    
Maintaining that the budget provision for debt servicing in 1995-96 
includes only the cost of interest on domestic loans because the 
principal amount is rolled over every year, the finance minister in 
Nawaz Sharifs cabinet did not mince words in warning that from now 
onward, we will have to borrow money to finance a substantial part of 
even our defence expenditures, apart from all other development and 
non-development outlays.

Mr Aziz said the domestic debt has been rising very sharply in the 
recent years and amounted to a whopping Rs 800 billion on July 1, 1995 
as against Rs 602 billion on July 1, 1993. In addition, he said there 
was an outstanding foreign debt of 22 billion dollars on July 1, 1995.

He explained that in 1995-96 the debt servicing together with the 
defence allocation of Rs 115 billion would amount to Rs 272 billion, 
against a total expected revenues of Rs 265 billion.

Everything else, that is governments administrative expenditure Rs 
40 billion and development expenditure of Rs 96.5 billion has to be 
financed from further borrowing. He expressed the apprehension that 
there being hardly any prospects of achieving the revenue target of 
Rs 265 billion this year, the actual borrowing will even be higher 
than that forecast in the budget.

Mr Aziz said prospects for the next year looked even more ominous, and 
warned that even if the total revenues increase to Rs 270 billion, 
the projected debt servicing  liability of Rs 185 billion will consume 
almost 70 per cent of projected revenues in 1996-97. The leftover 
would cover only 65 per cent of the expected defence budget.

Mr Aziz said the issue of scrutinising the defence allocation in the 
budget had already been raised in parliament and various proposals 
were being considered for this purpose.

Referring to the point raised by a reporter that all taxes, direct or 
indirect, be levied after a debate by the elected representatives of 
the people, the former finance minister said his party had already 
moved in parliament against the recent enforcement of a heavy tax 
package through an ordinance. He offered a three-point agenda to the 
government to extricate the country from the current impasse, namely 
reduction in non-development expenditure, giving impetus to economic 
activities and generating revenue.

For this, he said the government would have to make a commitment to 
development and require many hard decisions that involved finding a 
solution of Karachi situation, restoring confidence in the businessmen 
to generate economic activities which in turn would create employment 
opportunities, yield revenue to public exchequer and stabilise prices.

<a name="fore">Forex reserves plunge to $525m level</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, Dec. 20: Foreign exchange reserves plunged to a two-year low 
level of $525 million (Rs 18.527 billion), showing a record single 
week fall of about $225 million (Rs 8 billion), figures released by 
the State Bank for the week-ended December 19, showed.
    
The forex reserves at $525 million is very unfavourable when compared 
with some of the neighbouring countries including India and Bangladesh 
whose forex reserves are at $28 billion and $25 billion respectively.
    
Awaiting perhaps the inflow of the first instalment of the IMFs grant 
of $200 million, due to be pumped into the system, officials are less 
worried about the near-alarming situation, a banker said.
 
The current reserves are not enough to meet three weeks import bill 
until backed by recovery of outstanding export bills, and a spurt in 
remittances dose not materialise, financial experts said.
    
The State Bank figures for the weekend December 19, 1995, put the 
official approved reserve figure at $525 million (Rs 18.527 billion) 
as compared to $722 million (Rs 26.289 billion) a week ago.
    
But officials stick to their forex figure of $1.2 billion adding 
apparently invisible credit lines including gold reserves of $600 
million.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 14: The Privatisation Commission shortlisted Faysal 
Islamic Bank of Bahrain and Saudi Basharahil Group for the purchase of 
26 per cent shares of the United Bank Limited.
    
The officials of the Commission have claimed that both the Middle 
Eastern groups have been shortlisted after a thorough and 
extensive exercise of evaluation of pre-qualification of documents.
    
Sources in the Commission told Dawn that the privatisation process of 
26 per cent shares of the UBL will be completed within next two to 
three weeks after a confidential agreement to be signed with a new 
management. A data room has been set up in Karachi to scrutinise the 
loan portfolio of the bank and examine the board of its directors.
    
Then they will be asked to give their sealed bids along with the 
earnest money and a bid bond. These bids then will be opened in their 
presence and the highest bidder will be transferred these shares along 
with a management control, a source said.

<a name="laun">Launching of Rs 10,000 bonds</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Dec. 16: The stage is set for the launching of the prize 
bonds of Rs 10,000 denomination amidst split hopes and fears of the 
market players succeeding a somewhat successful show of Rs 25,000 
denomination bonds that generated an approximate saving of Rs 4.2 
billion within 15 days of its launch.

These encashable bonds will carry 26 prizes in alla first prize of Rs 
10 million, five second prizes of Rs 1.0 million each and 20 other 
prizes of Rs 0.5 million each. The bonds being issued by the 
government will be sold by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), 
commercial banks and national saving centres. The first draw will be 
held on March 15.

A survey of Boulton Market, the hub of illegal trading of prize bonds, 
revealed that the investors who trade prize bonds in the market 
through parchi system are watching the market situation before 
venturing into the illegal trade of the new bonds.

Shopkeepers-based in Boulton Market told Dawn that big investors 
planned to offer the already launched prize bonds of Rs 25,000 
denomination from 1st of February i.e. just fifteen days before the 
due date of the first draw. They said a similar trend was likely to be 
followed in the case of prize bonds of Rs 10,000 denomination whose 
first draw is due on March 15. 

Parchi system is a mechanism for unauthorised trade of prize bonds. 
The agents of big investors having lots of prize bonds allot the 
number of certain bonds to their clients either through parchi or a 
chit or photostat copies of the bonds worth a few rupees.

If the bond wins a prize the prize amount is divided equally among the 
parchi holders. Some parchis sold for much higher prices offer a bond 
in full and in these cases a mutually agreed portion of the prize won 
on the bond is given to the parchi holder.

<a name="poor">Poor response to Rs 10,000 bonds</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Dec. 17: The much-publicised prize bonds of Rs 10,000 
denomination received a rather unimpressive response on their 
launching as only Rs 38.32 million worth of these bonds were sold 
throughout the day  making the show poorer than the launching of Rs 
25,000 denomination bonds. These bonds had attracted an investment of 
Rs 278.5 million on the first day.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) sold the Rs 10,000 bonds to 
commercial banks for onward selling as well as to household 
individuals and corporate entities and the Central Directorate of 
National Savings  the state-run bonds dealers  could not arrange the 
sale of these bonds for the reasons not made public.

The bonds of Rs 10,000 denomination are encashable at any time and 
carry a first prize of Rs 10 million five second prizes of Rs 1.0 
million each and 20 other prizes of Rs 0.5 million each. The first 
draw of the bonds will be held on March 15 after a shut period of two 
months and this will follow a quarterly draw with the same shut 
period. The government has issued these bonds as well as the Rs 25,000 
denomination bonds to reduce its direct bank borrowings and mop up 
excess liquidity from the open market to cover deficit financing.

Short-term and long-term measures, he explained, were initiated to 
overcome the slump in the market contributed by different factors. He 
also said the foreign exchange reserves were drained out in the first 
four months due to the payment regarding debt servicing.
    
He further said that first tranche worth $200 million from standby

<a name="more">More mutual funds to ease liquidity crunch</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M.Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 18: Chairman Corporate Law Authority (CLA), Shamim 
Ahmad Khan has said that the establishment of more and more mutual 
funds would facilitate an accelerated flow of resources to stock 
markets and ensure as well that the investments of small savers are 
not put to unnecessary risks.

Mr Khan said while he cannot predict as to how the market will shape 
up in the immediate future, he was, however, hopeful that with the 
establishment of more and more mutual funds, the so-called liquidity 
crunch would ease up.

Mr Khan gave the impression that he for one would like the market to 
develop with no interference from the government and minimum possible 
regulations; but he said he was also conscious of the fact that the 
regulatory body (CLA) had an important role to play in minimising 
irregularities and to provide the needed infrastructure within which 
the markets should operate.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 19: The government has exempted the levy of 2 per cent 
penal surcharge on all those goods in the bonded warehouse which were 
over due for clearance but will now be cleared by December 31.
    
About Rs 4 billion revenue is leviable on the goods now stocked in 
the bonded warehouses, the Chairman of the Group Mr Raees Ashraf Tar 
Mohammad said. These goods include items on which leviable revenue 
amounts to Rs 1 billion and are over due for clearance.
    
He said that the goods were stuck in the bonded warehouses for a 
number of reasons and additional levy of 2 per cent penal surcharge 
would have proved proverbial last straw on the camel back.
    
However, the Kiryana Merchants Group approached the government and 
made a convincing case before the authorities to obtain concessions of 
getting exemption from the two per cent penal surcharge.

<a name="cred">Credit rating relaxation for leasing companies upset modarabas</a>

Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Dec. 20: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has exempted all 
leasing companies having less than three years of operation from the 
mandatory credit rating imposed on all Non-Bank Financial Institutions 
(NBFIs) in April last a move that has stirred jealousy among 
modarabas that still wait for similar relaxations.
    
Rauf Kadri said the decision would hit the leasing modarabas hard as 
the SBP decision will provide the leasing companies an edge over them.
    
No SBP official was available to explain as to why they chose the 
leasing sector to accord relaxations in mandatory credit rating and 
left the other segments of the NBFIs particularly modarabas apparently 
neglected.

<a name="prof">Profit-selling dominates trading on stock market</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 14: Weekend profit-selling dominated the trading on the 
stock market as investors were more inclined to leave the market 
rather than buying at the dips.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange 100-share managed to retain in part some of 
the previous gains but fell on the day by 15.46 points at 1,407.68 as 
compared to Wednesdays 1,423.14, reflecting the weakness of the base 
shares.
    
BOC Pakistan, which showed an all-time single session highest gain of 
Rs 315.75 overnight after the announcement of cash and stock dividend 
of well over 300 per cent, came in for selling at the inflated level 
and was marked down by Rs 200, with 700 shares changing hands.
    
Minus signs dominated the scene under the lead of PSO, which shed 
another Rs 13 on renewed selling. It was followed by Lever Brother, 
which suffered decline ranging from Rs 10 to 35.
    
Among the other MNCs, which fell sharply Pakistan Gum, Wellcome 
Pakistan and Glaxo Lab were leading, which fell by Rs 5 to 6.50.
    
Among the local blue chips, which remained under pressure, D.K. Khan 
Cement, Javed Omer, Quality Steel, Apex Fabrics, Century Insurance, 
4th ICP, Shafiq Textiles and Crescent Star Insurance were leading, 
which fell by Rs 2 to 5.
    
Some of the leading shares managed to show good gains under the lead 
of National Fibre, Nestle Milkpak, Grays of Cambridge and Diamond 
Pakistan, which rose by Rs 2 to 4.50.
    
Other good gainers were led by Essa Cement, Sui Southern and Sui 
Northern and some others.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, steady 10 paisa on 9.280 
million shares, slightly below a half of the total, followed by PTC 
vouchers, lower 20 paisa on 2.904 million shares, Dewan Salman, off Rs 
1.10 on 688,500 shares, Faysal Bank, steady 15 paisa on 535,500 
shares, ICI Pakistan, easy 50 paisa on 483,500 shares, Dhan Fibre, 
lower 10 paisa on 147,500 shares, Platinum Bank, lower 10 paisa on 
123,000 shares and Honda Atlas Cars, off Rs 1.25 on 118,500 shares.

Trading volume showed a modest rise at 21.816 million shares from the 
previous 21.404 million shares thanks to heavy buying in current 
favourites.
    
There were 348 actives, out of which 190 shares fell, while 90 rose, 
with 68 holding on to the last levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 17: Stocks staged a smart rally as blue chips recovered 
on a wide front aided by strong support extended by leading 
institutional traders.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices showed a sustained 
rally of about 34 points at 1,441.10 as compared to 1,407.36 at the 
weekend.
    
Other MNCs, which followed it were led by Brooke Bond, ICI Pakistan, 
Telecard, and some others, rising by Rs 2.70 to 5.

Shell Pakistan responded favourably to news of a good payout and rose 
by Rs 7 and PSO followed it, which rose Rs 28.85 after being ex-
dividend and ex-bonus at Rs 246.15. Well over 3,000 shares were traded 
at the lower level.

Most of the other energy shares also rose, notable gainers among them 
being Kohinoor Genertek and Kohinoor Power, and Sui Southern.

Other good gainers were led by Lease Pak, Ghemini Leasing, Bankers 
Equity, Faysal Bank, EFU, Adamjee Insurance, Crescent Textiles, Shezan 
International and Dewan Salman.

Big losers were led by Crescent Star Insurance, Shafiq Textiles, 
Artistic Denim, Quice Foods, Diamond Industries, and Orient Straw 
Board, which suffered fall ranging from Rs 1.50 to 5 but selling was 
light.

5.362 million shares followed by PTC vouchers, firm 85 paisa
on 2.508 million shares, Dewan Salman, higher Rs.2.50 on 860,500 
shares, ICI Pakistan, up Rs.2.70 on 412,500 shares, Maple Leaf Cement,

There were 300 actives, out of which 120 shares rose, 115 fell, with 
65 holding on to the last levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 18: Stocks extended the overnight rally as follow-up 
support figured prominently on the blue chips counters amid an 
actively traded session.

The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices scored a fresh gain 
of 5.85 points at 1,449.02 as compared to 1,443.17 a day earlier, 
reflecting the strength of base shares.

Most of the MNCs led the market advance under the lead of BOC 
Pakistan, which posted a fresh sharp gain of Rs 40 to quote at Rs 490 
against the face value of Rs 10. The sustained rise was attributed to 
over 300 per cent dividend declared by it last week.

Others to follow included Shell Pakistan after the announcement of 50 
per cent right shares at a premium of Rs 80 each on a 10-rupee share, 
Pak-Suzuki Motors, Fauji Fertiliser, Pakistan Gum, Brooke Bond and 
Lever Brothers.

Among the local blue chips and low-priced issues, which rose sharply 
Askari Leasing, Crescent Star Insurance, National Fibre, Haroon Oils, 
Karam Ceramics, United Distributors, Noon Sugar, and Sui Northern.

Bulk of the activity was, however, confined to bank, synthetic, 
energy, cement, and chemical. Sugar shares were also traded higher.

The most active list was led by Hub-Power, up 40 paisa on 9.086 
million shares followed by PTC vouchers, easy 10 paisa on 3.510 
million shares, ICI Pakistan, lower 30 paisa on 568,000 shares, Faysal 
Bank, up 50 paisa on 554,500 shares, Dewan Salman, higher 50 paisa on 
525,000 shares, Nishat Mills, lower 50 paisa on 174,500 shares, and 
Pioneer Cement, off 75 paisa on 134,700 shares. There were some other 
notable deals also.

Trading volume rose to about 18 million shares, from the overnights 
16.417 million thanks to active activity in the current favourites.

There were 305 actives, out of which 120 shares rose, 125 fell, with 
60 holding on to the last levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 19: Stocks remained in a bearish frame of mind as 
follow-up support was not that aggressive as it was during the last 
two sessions.

The KSE 100-share index fell 8.21 points or 0.58 per cent at 1,441.02 
as compared to 1,449.23 a day earlier, reflecting the relative 
weakness of the base shares. The all share index also fell 0.52 per 
cent or 4.17 points at 800.56 as against overnights 804.73.

The list of losing shares was led by MNCs, notably Abbott Lab, 
Pakistan Gum, which rose Rs 8 overnight, Bata Pakistan, Shell 
Pakistan, Lever Brothers, Ghandhara and ICI Pakistan, which suffered 
decline ranging from one rupee to Rs 3.40, biggest fall being in the 
ICI Pakistan, which has been in active demand over the last few 
sessions.

Local blue chips, which came in for active selling were led by Adamjee 
Insurance, New Jubilee Insurance, Sui Northern, Sui Southern, and some 
others falling by one rupee to Rs 2.

Although minus signs dominated the list, some of the leading shares 
managed to finish with good gains, notably gainers among them being 
Bankers Equity, Bawany Sugar, Cherat Cement, Haroon Oils, Engro 
Chemicals, Nestle Milkpak and United Distributors, which rose by one 
rupee to Rs 2.

Hub-Power again led the list of most actives, lower 45 paisa on 9.935 
million shares, followed by PTC vouchers, unchanged on 4.975 million 
shares, ICI Pakistan, sharply down by Rs 3.40 on 940,600 shares, Dewan

Ardeshir Cowasjee

HABIBUL WAHABUL KHAIRI, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Al-
Jehad Trust (established to fight for the rights of man and against 
the oppressors of the masses), is considered by his detractors to be 
a busybody.

But the fact is that he has the courage of his convictions, and stands 
up in our courts of law to fight for his beliefs, which brackets him 
above the majority of moribund 130 million of Pakistan.

In 1994 advocate Khairi filed a petition in the Lahore High Court 
challenging the manner of the appointment of judges. The petition was 
dismissed. Leave to appeal was granted by the Supreme Court. The 
Additional Judges of the LHC who were not confirmed were transposed as 
co-petitioners. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah constituted a full bench 
which he headed, comprising Justices Ajmal Mian, Fazal Elahi, Manzoor 
Hussain Sial and Mir Hazar Khan Khooso. Notices were sent to Attorney-
General Qazi Jameel, the Advocates-General of Sindh, Punjab, NWFP and 
Balochistan, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Advocate 
Akramn Shaikh, the presidents of the High Court Bar Associations of 
the four provinces, and to amicus curiae Sharifuddin Pirzada, S.M. 
Zafar and Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim.

November 5, 1995: Islamabad First regular hearing. The AG pleaded that 
the appeal filed by Mujeeb Pirzada against the judgment of the SHC 
upholding the validity of the 8th Amendment may be heard along with 
these petitions. The Court observed that this appeal cannot be tied up 
with the present petitions which relate merely to the interpretation 
of the various articles of the Constitution concerning  the superior 
judiciary. Had the Court ruled otherwise, Justice Ajmal Mian would 
have been excluded from the Bench, as he was the author of the 
judgment in the Mujeeb Pirzada case in SHC.

The advocate-General of Sindh, supported by the other provincial AGs, 
sought an adjournment to enable them to file their replies. The court 
observed that this was an important matter and that no adjournment 
would be granted. The replies could be filed as the proceedings 
continued.

The Court decided that the three amicii would argue last, the 
juniormost to begin. Petitioned Wahabul Khairi argued his own 
petition.

November 6: Islamabad. It was reported that AG Jameel was ill and had 
been hospitalised that morning. The federation requested that the case 
be adjourned to a date in office, i.e. after several weeks because of 
the AGs reported illness. The Court agreed to an adjournment but 
fixed the next date of hearing for November 19. Reportedly, the AG 
left hospital that same evening. November 19: Islamabad. The 
Federation resubmitted its application for an adjournment on the 
ground that AG Jameel had been ordered to rest at home for 30 days. 
Petitioned Khairi objected, stating that AG Jameel was openly working 
in his office and had even been shown on PTV attending a function. 
Proceedings continued with Advocate Raja Akram being allowed to plead 
the cause of the unconfined judges.

November 19-20: Hyderabad. During the night, the home of Chief Justice 
Sajjad Ali Shahs daughter (married to Superintending) Engineer Parvez 
Ali Shah) was surrounded by four police mobile vans carrying some 25 
policemen. Three DSPs and two officers knocked on the door. A servant 
informed the officers that the family was away. One officer declared 
himself to be Inspector Muzammil Hussain of the anti-corruption 
department. No warrants or court orders were shown. The five officers 
, plus a squad of policemen, entered the house which they searched and 
ransacked. They found no incriminating evidence. This incident was 
reported in the Press and remains uncontradicted. Later in the 
morning, the office of Engineer Pervez Ali Shah was searched and 
sealed and a motor car log book was taken away.

November 20: Peshawar. An active member of the Peoples Lawyers Forum 
(the lawyers wing of the PPP), Advocate Mohammad Arif Khan, whose 
name has just been entered on he Supreme Court rolls, filed a 
constitutional writ petition, under Article 199, in the High Court. 
His counsel is the unaffordable-by-him Barrister Jehanzeb Rahim. It is 
said in Peshawar that the petition is inspired. This writ challenges 
only the appointment of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief Justice of 
Pakistan, who is cited as the sole respondent. The writ prays that 
..... the respondent be directed to show under what authority of law 
he claims to hold the office of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and in 
the event of the respondent failing to do so, this Honble court may 
be pleased to declare the holding of the said office by the respondent 
as unconstitutional, illegal and without lawful authority.

November 20-22: Islamabad. As time as available, junior most amicus, 
Fakhruddin, gave the Supreme Court the benefit of his wisdom. The 
first day, he set forth with all guns blazing, attacking, all the 
previous governments, even criticising Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and the 
performance of the judiciary. On the second day, he was in a 
conciliatory mood, his criticisms vastly tempered, and by the third 
day he had done a complete U-turn. As remarked a listener in court, he 
went up like a rocket and fell like a twig. The Court adjourned to 
meet again on the 26th.

November 25: Islamabad. Chief Justice Sajjad Alik Shah suffered a 
cardiac incident, serious enough to warrant the doctors admitting him 
to the ICU at PIMS. (He was discharged on the 28th, after which he 
went home to Karachi to rest.) November 26: Islamabad. The SC 
proceedings were adjourned.

November 26: Peshawar. In the High Court, recently appointed Justice 
Qazi Hamiduddin and Zinat Khan hearing Arif's writ petition ordered: 
"... this court would prefer to dispense with the normal procedure of 
pre-admission notice to the respondent and calling for his documents 
and also pre-admission hearing and admit for full hearing the points 
raised in this writ petition.... This court would direct that this 
writ petition shall be placed before the Chief Justice of this Court 
for the constitution of a larger bench... Adjourned to a date in 
office." 

November 26: Karachi. Secretary to the Government of Sindh Mohammad 
Sharif signed and issued Notification No. S.O. (E-V)10-3/89: "With the 
approval of Competent Authority Mr Parvez Ali Shah, Superintending 
Engineer (B19), Education, Works Circle Hyderabad, is hereby placed 
under suspension with immediate effect and until further-orders." (The 
Competent Authority is the Chief Minister of Sindh, Syed Abdullah 
Shah, with an unblemished record, was suspended, unheard.

November 27: Peshawar. Advocate Khairi filed an application in the 
High Court. He pleaded, inter alia, that 'well over a year and a half 
after the appointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan the Peshawar 
High Court had admitted a petition challenging this appointment; that 
the filing of the petition is tantamount to sabotaging the 
Constitution and the judicial system; that the filing of such a 
petition indicates that the intentions of the petitioner must be held 
as highly questionable; that the Prime Minister and the President are 
responsible for ensuring that the High Courts of the country are 
responsible for ensuring that the High Courts of the country are 
headed by acting chief justices, a mala fide act of the worst order; 
that the Prime Minister and the President are trying to impede the 
hearing of his petition filed in the Supreme Court; that the petition 
filed in Peshawar is not maintainable and should be dismissed 
forthwith, failing which Khairi himself should be heard:'

December 2: Islamabad. The proposed cause list of the SC was published 
for work during the week commencing December 10 on which date Khairi's 
petition was fixed as item No. 1.

December 3: Islamabad. The AG sought an adjournment for the fourth 
time. AG Qazi Jameel submitted that he had been invited to attend a 
money-laundering symposium in Tokyo necessitating his departure from 
Pakistan on December 10. He stated he was likely to be away for 'not 
less than seven days', by which time the Court vacation would have 
commenced. Since, maintained the AG, his presence during the hearing 
of the Khairi case was essential, he asked for a further adjournment. 
This was granted and the case is now fixed for January 21.

<a name="allo">All over the place : Make use of TV!</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Omar Kureishi

THE Prime Minister had some harsh words for the print media. Some felt 
that she had gone over the top. Others that the print media had it 
coming. Blunt she may have been, she was also candid. The electronic 
media, however, got off scot-free.

There is a reason for this. The electronic media in this country is 
not strictly speaking an opinion-maker. Whenever there is a discussion 
or debate on the freedom of the press, it is automatically assumed 
that radio and television are exempted from scrutiny.

Radio and television have been state-controlled from the beginning and 
though there have been some token movements to attempt a modicum of 
objectivity, these attempts have been of a non-serious kind. No one 
has been surprised that the attempts have failed or really cared. The 
electronic media is a part of the dowry that an incoming government 
receives. Governments are not whitewashed and oppositions blacked out 
so that an illusion of even-handedness is created. No one can accuse 
the BBC or CNN of being audio-visual press handouts. Yet the 
electronic media could have played a vital role in nation-building. 
Television is often accused of being a major contributory factor in 
spreading crime and violence, that it has a negative impact on the 
minds of viewers who see too much blood on the screens.

My contention is that if television can have a negative impact, it can 
have a positive one as well. It can be used to educate viewers. It can 
be used to defuse political tension as well for it can bring out the 
grievances, real or imagined, into the open and these grievances can 
be aired and argued, for and against. It would have a cathartic 
effect.

There is in Karachi, for instance, no seeming meeting ground between 
the antagonists, there is, instead a communication break-down. To hear 
the leaders talk, and the violence of language exceeds the violence on 
the streets, there are irreconcilable differences. The general public 
which includes people of every persuasion see themselves as victims 
caught in a cross-fire, in the catch-22 of no matter who wins, they 
lose because the general public is too preoccupied in making ends meet 
and they have real problems.

No political agenda includes their welfare other than as a slogan. Why 
cant there be a dialogue between this general public and the 
politicians on television? A cross-section of the public could be 
interviewed and asked to give their views about the violence in 
Karachi, what they felt about it and how it could be curbed if not 
stopped. The views expressed should be genuine rather than stage-
managed and should be put on the air unedited.

Democracy is about participation and the politicians, on both sides, 
may be quite surprised to learn of the publics assessment. The 
problem with our kind of democracy is that the politicians have never 
really consulted their constituents, never sat down with them and 
asked them for their list of priorities.

What marvellous television it would make if such meetings were put on 
the air, live, spontaneous. It would also allow the public see the 
mettle of their representatives, whether they can provide coherent and 
credible answers to the many questions that would be put to them. The 
government has much to answer for, so too has the opposition. Such 
open discussions would have a salutary effect on our representatives. 
It might even be able to tell them how out of touch they are with the 
real needs of the people. I cannot see it happening but that does not 
mean that it should not happen.

We have concentrated too much on a dialogue between political parties. 
These have proved to be meaningless. They have ended up as point 
scoring contests. I am all for talk, for dialogue but the end-
objective must be the peoples well-being. There is so much loose talk 
about the system as if the system is a mechanism that has a will of 
its own and is not dependant on the quality of people who make it 
work. But most of all a system must be allowed to work. One cannot 
derail it and then complain that the system does not work. There is 
also a great deal of talk about accountability but we tend to consider 
accountability in the narrowest of contexts, mainly financial 
impropriety. There is also such a thing as accountability of 
performance. That is why I have been an advocate of televising the 
proceedings of the National Assembly and the Senate, live and 
unedited. That will achieve a measure of accountability of the elected 
representatives and it is very important that they be made answerable. 
Television will reveal their merit.

The idea should be to strengthen democracy and this can be done if the 
people are able to participate. They are, after all, not by standards 
or should not be in a democracy.

The print media is a little like the radio commentary. On television 
one picture is worth a thousand words and no matter how you manipulate 
it, the television picture is revealing and tell more than many people 
imagine. Bring television into play constructively and boldly. It will 
fortify democracy, not weaken it.

<a name="bank">Bank privatisation out of tune with new trend</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Jafar Wafa

SHOULD the government privatise even the two fairly patronised Banks  
Habib and United  and not merge them to create a Pakistani behemoth 
for international trade and commerce?

This would mean falling in line with forward-looking countries. And it 
can be done concurrently with purging both these institutions of those 
managerial elements which are responsible for their present unhappy 
financial condition. Let us give this subject a serious thought on the 
eve of their sell-off to the approved bidder, not necessarily the 
highest, as has been the tradition in our Islamic Republic.

When we look around, we see that Japan, which is the second largest 
economy in the world, is creating a super bank with $810 billion of 
assets by merging the foreign-focused Bank of Tokyo with Mitsubishi 
Bank which has the largest domestic network in the country. They say 
that it would be a leviathan as compared to USs Citibank. Even in 
capitalist Europe, state-run large banks are not being privatised. 
Despite being in financing straits, the French state-owned bank, 
Credit Lyonnais, is not being sold off, although it is presently in 
hot waters because of its careless (not unscrupulous or corrupt) 
lending policy and a few thoughtless investments like acquisition of 
Hollywoods largest movie makers, the MGM. On the contrary, the French 
government is providing it the needed financial prop, at a time when 
the government itself is not sitting on any kind of financial boom. 
The object is that the Bank, somehow, keeps its nose above water and 
tides over the setback. Even the USA, as has been recently reported by 
our Press, is going to establish an international Bank for trading 
specifically with the Middle East and the oil-rich Gulf, where the 
Arabs are already beholden to anything bearing the American stamp. 
Coming closer home, we find that India is also encouraging off-shore 
investment by Indian corporate sector through the banking channel, 
easing some of the restrictions on Indian investments in foreign 
lands. The Reserve bank of India notified on November 27 that the 
total investment should be repatriated through normal banking channel 
by way of dividends or royalty within five years.

Enslaved to US

Our economic wizards are content with complying with what the US  
dominated financial institutions dictate, instead of looking for a 
change to draw inspiration, towards Japan or the grown-up tigers or 
to China which are now concentrating on building up big banks and 
giving them all they need to enjoy the reputation of financial 
soundness, efficient management and honest dealings.

Though commonplace, banks are not only money-centres merely to accept 
deposits and advance loans for various purposes they are meant to 
promote capital-markets activity for industrial development, according 
to governments priorities, and international commerce, again in 
keeping with governmental guidelines. Our economy and national culture 
have yet to take such a shape as to allow a free hand to all those who 
have hot money in their private coffers or who can raise the required 
capital by bribing bank managers. This aspect will further reinforce 
the argument against palming off the nationalised banks to those who 
can afford to buy them.

There is no gainsaying that our public sector banks, including HBL & 
UBL, suffer from the national malaise of sloth, greed and ineptitude. 
Foreign banks, however, manned mostly by Pakistanis operating on our 
own soil, are models of financial perfection and enviable customer 
relationship. The remedy, therefore, lies not in privatising the banks 
but in insulating them from the currents and cross-currents of 
politics and protecting them from those individuals or groups who have 
the required political clout to borrow without the necessary 
collateral and evade repayment if and when the bank management cares 
to remind them.

The much - needed organisational overhauling, inducting banking 
specialists (from abroad, if necessary) and weeding out political 
nominees whose personal interests and those of their patrons 
overshadow the interest of the bank, are the obvious remedial steps. 
Why not follow the golden rule of Americas big business: Link pay 
with performance? Why follow only the American example of making over 
the entire country to private entrepreneurs?

Public sector ownership is not to be blamed. Critics have, in fact, 
seriously suggested, from time to time, that the Federal Secretariat 
itself is the most deserving candidate for privatisation, if only the 
recipe known for improvement is privatisation. Iran has not gone in 
for privatisation and yet its public sector industries are producing 
indigenously-built (not assembled) automobiles, tanks and other 
weapons of war. And why not look at our own Kahuta? Why not run other 
public sector enterprises along than lines, at a safe distance from 
political meddling.

Perhaps privatisation is perceived by the Third World leaders, 
including Carlos Salinas, the now-exiled President of Mexico, to be 
the best means of self-enrichment. It has now been exposed by a 
prestigious American business journal in March this year, that Salinas 
latched on to the idea of economic modernisation merely to allegedly 
enrich himself and his cronies through the lucrative sell-off of more 
than 1,000 state run-companies during his six-year rule ending 1994 
when he had to be flown outside his country to save his skin.

<a name="inte">Interests of Pakistan & IMF clash</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hasan Askree

RELATIONS between Pakistan and the IMF have changed in the last few 
months  from being extremely co-operative to distinctly strained. In 
January 1995, Pakistan and the IMF signed a contract under which the 
IMF will provide technical assistance to the State Bank and the 
Corporate Law Authority by closely monitoring the departments, during 
the years 1996-98.

The IMF was willing to cooperate on a number of different fronts, by 
developing a close working relation. But, then came the federal budget 
for the year 1995-96 which marked the turning point of Pakistan-IMF 
relations. Actually, the turning point was prior to the budget. The 
budget merely served as a trigger for the IMF to express their 
disapproval, as is explained later.

In Pakistan, a slowing down of reforms was called for. The earlier 
reforms have come in swiftly and haphazardly. Stock markets in 
Pakistan are among the most open in the developing world. Foreign 
investment and ownership has the least restrictions. 

Large scale privatisation has occurred at a time when buyers are hard 
to find. Import duties have been slashed dramatically. Private and 
foreign banks have come in and the process of credit and financing is 
undergoing a revolution. Now, the entrepreneurs must be given time to 
assimilate the impact of the reforms.

Effects of reforms 

Many entrepreneurs still do not have a clue as to how the reforms are 
affecting the feasibility of their businesses. If fast pace of reforms 
is continued, otherwise viable businesses will be forced to close down 
when they could be capitalising on the reforms.

Besides, there are other reasons for slowing down the pace of reforms. 
Some of them are: increased, persistent and inexplicable inflation; 
closure of businesses and industry; ineffective tax collection 
machinery leading to reforms like introduction of VAT; primitive 
banking system which fails to identify businesses with better 
prospects; disincentive in saving which limits the capital for 
investment; a decade of no harsh reforms prior to introducing free-
market reforms; reduced confidence of the business community in 
governing regulations; lack of will to take initiatives because of 
lawlessness and insecurity; lack of professionalism in the businesses.

In this scenario, the IMF cannot claim that bringing the budget 
deficit from 5.6 to 4.0 and the tariff rates from 70 per cent to 45 
per cent in one year is in the best interest of the Pakistan economy. 
The bottom line is that given the economys outlook, there are genuine 
and undeniable reasons for reducing the pace of free-market reforms.

Pakistan and the IMF are expected to share the same goal; the best 
interest of the Pakistan economy. Yes, both the Pakistan government 
and the IMF have an interest in a healthy Pakistan economy, but for 
different reasons. The IMF has an interest in he Pakistan economy, as 
long as it shows prospects of a sustainable growth. This is for two 
reasons. First, a lender has to ensure that the borrower does not 
default. Second, since the IMF attaches explicit conditions for 
granting loans, bad performance of the economy reflects poorly on the 
IMFs conditionalities.

Experts constantly debate the objectives of the IMF. In the midst of 
all the criticism, the IMFs survival is threatened if it supports 
economies that are heading for a plunge.

In Pakistans case, the IMF is extra cautious. Pakistan has taken many 
drastic and unpopular steps on the IMFs suggestion. The present 
government has increased tax and utility rates, kept interest rates 
high, relaxed price controls, reduced import duties, cut down 
development expenditure, attempted to check tax evasion, etc. The IMF 
has always claimed that such difficult steps are necessary to cure an 
ailing economy. Pakistan has complied with most of the IMFs 
requirements like few countries have ever done before. Now, if the IMF 
continues to support Pakistan, at stake will be the credibility of the 
IMFs prescription. The faltering of Pakistans economy will reflect 
on the wisdom in the IMFs reforms  their inadequacy to address the 
peculiarities of each economy.

Pakistan is likely to face immense problems in liberalising and 
revitalising its economy. There are always hurdles to prosperity, but 
in Pakistans case the hurdles are not trivial; such as conflict with 
India, influence of Arab extremism, crude political system, 
illiteracy, ethnicity, sectarianism, population explosion, culture of 
lawlessness, ineptitude of intelligentsia and leaders, distorted 
economy, financial crunch, Pakistans insistence on denying reality 
and limitations. Chances are slim that Pakistan will be listed among 
the Asian tigers. The IMF has realised this unfortunate reality. Now, 
it does not want to be seen as prescribing reforms to an economy that 
may not rebounce.

The reasons for the changed attitude of the IMF go beyond the reduced 
pace of free-market reforms adopted by the government. It has to do 
with the outlook of the economy despite all the dictation taken by the 
government from the IMF. The IMFs cold shoulder has not come as a 
surprise, when the international rating of the economy is sliding; 
sanctions on export of cotton have been imposed as dumping charges; 
business capital of the country is stricken with indiscriminate 
killings and strikes; and the economy shows signs of faltering. The 
IMF wants to disassociate itself from the difficulties faced by 
Pakistan in the way of reviving the economy, and for valid reasons.

The IMF has, therefore, refused to grant a one-year moratorium for the 
implementation of conditionalities attached to the extended structural 
adjustment facility (ESAF) programme. As long as the Pakistans 
economy shows signs of decline, the IMF can be expected to be harsh, 
and when the economy is improving, it will be eager to help. This is 
not to say that the IMF is serving an ignoble cause. Not at all. The 
IMF has limited resources for granting loans. 

It has to pick the economies that show the best prospects of recovery 
with its help of soft loans. The IMF has to ensure that its resources 
are put to best use by deriving the maximum benefit. The IMF is funded 
for reviving those economies which can a) rebounce with relatively 
little help, and b) all the necessary steps are being taken in the 
economy to ensure success.

This new scenario of not having the IMFs support has multi-
dimensional consequences for which Pakistan must prepare itself. So 
far, the governments economic policy has been dictated by the IMF. 
Now, it will have to accept the fact that the IMFs prescriptions may 
fall short of reviving the economy. The optimum economic policy can 
only evolve by taking into account the many peculiarities of 
Pakistans economy  something that the IMFs prescription fails to 
address. A comprehensive economic strategy must come from within 
Pakistan.

After losing the support of the IMF, an expansion of the governments 
economic policy-making team is called for. Some entrepreneurs, 
managers, and consultants who have gone through the rut of working in 
the private sector must be made part of the decision-making team. The 
government must not hesitate in hiring from the private sector.

These people understand the needs of politics in the decision-making 
process just as well as the bureaucrats do. Besides, they will bring 
experience and insight which bureaucrats, children of rich 
businessmen, and foreign qualified and experienced economists lack. 
Lastly, the government must remember that unavailability of suitable 
candidates is never an excuse for inadequate staffing. Whenever a 
manager does not have a suitable worker in mind, he advertises.

<a name="exch">Foreign exchange reserves: a critique</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
S. Hasan Azad

THE FOREIGN exchange reserve level has been in the limelight these 
days. The position of such reserves in Pakistan has political 
overtones, because it determines the economic viability of the 
government to meet import liabilities and therefore the capability to 
deal with foreign governments and international financial 
institutions.

The higher the reserves, the greater is the economic viability. An 
attempt is made here to peep into intricacies of such reserves. 
Foreign exchange reserves are composed of gold, liquid foreign 
exchange, and investment in foreign securities. But foreign exchange 
reserves normally refer to liquid reserves only. The reserves are held 
by the State Bank like deposit in which export earnings are credited 
and import liabilities debited. When the level of export earnings is 
higher than that of import liabilities during a given period of time, 
the reserves would rise and vice versa.

There is always a time lag between shipment of goods to foreign 
countries and actual foreign exchange receipts. There are two ways - 
one is sight against letter of credit and the other is usual. Under 
sight, time is short say 15 days whereas under usuals the exporter 
allows maximum time of 120 days. Our exporters normally send 
consignments against contract and as such payments are received 
several days after the shipment. Sometimes, lower or no payments are 
received if the consigned goods are of not upto the standard, under 
such circumstances, receipts normally fall short of shipment of goods.

In the case of imports also, there are usual and sight procedures like 
export. Payments are usually made before arrival of goods at the port. 
Normally it is 15 days from the date the goods are shipped. In other 
words, Pakistan is in a disadvantageous position with respect to both 
imports as well as exports.

In imports, payments are made before the goods arrive at our ports 
whereas in exports, payments are received after the shipment. That is 
why the import and export figures of the Federal Bureau of Statistics 
and those of State Bank always differ. The former treats export or 
import when goods are cleared by Customs and the latter treats export 
or import only when receipts or payments are made.

Export as per State Bank classification is invariably less than that 
of the Bureau, while this is not so for import. In other words, the 
level of foreign exchange reserves has to be treated with 
extraordinary caution as there is a lot of amount hanging in balance 
which must be carefully analysed for suitable policy prescription and 
could have avoided undue rumours and the lack of confidence as 
witnessed last month.

At the time of budget presentation the foreign exchange reserves were 
at $ 2,500 million whereas at end June it was $ 2,737 million besides 
2 million tory ounces of gold worth $ 793 million according to State 
Bank. By the end of October, reserves plummeted to $ 1,200 million, 
reflecting a depletion of $ 1,537 million over the first four months 
of the current fiscal year resulting from huge trade deficit following 
rise in imports and fall in exports which triggered the government to 
devalue the currency. By November 21, the level hit the lowest of $ 
1,095 million, only sufficient for five weeks imports. 

Mr V.A. Jafarey, Adviser to the Prime Minister has said that foreign 
exchange reserves would be $ 1.5 billion by the end of June next. 
Prime Minister and others have time and again debunked the rumour of 
freezing of foreign currency accounts estimated at $ 6.5 billion out 
of which some withdrawal has taken place. It has been argued that 
Pakistan is bound to refrain from freezing foreign currency accounts 
in accordance with Article VIII of the I M F treaty. It should be 
noted here that under stand-by arrangement of $ 600 million from I M F 
the first trance of $ 200 million will be available during this month 
which will buttress the reserves position.

Against the above backdrop, it is necessary to correctly assess the 
level of foreign exchange reserves which is usually lower by a certain 
margin because receivables are not included in the reserves. If 
receivables of $ 1,731 million, as noted above, are included, the 
reserves picture will drastically improve. On account of risk of non-
realisation, it may be pertinent to treat certain portion of the 
amount as reserves. The problem of treating receivables as reserves 
is likely to compound accounting problem for the State Bank and, as a 
result, these are not treated as reserves.

The foreign exchange reserves position is normally shrouded in mystery 
and ambiguity because of its sensitivity. Sometimes foreign currency 
accounts are used in foreign exchange payments. It has also been 
observed that the cheques on these accounts are not realised as the 
foreign currencies are not available with the banks. That is the 
reason why rumour of freezing of such accounts was rebutted several 
times by government functionaries. 

With the deregulation in the area of foreign exchange, there is a need 
for more vigilant monitoring and correct assessment of reserves in 
order to pre-empt the panic or speculation that prevailed recently.

The State Bank, in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance, needs to 
formulate an unambiguous strategy with regard to the assessment of 
true position of foreign exchange reserves particularly in a 
deregulated framework so that appropriate policies with regard to 
trade, tariff, and exchange rate of rupee can be adopted in the larger 
interest of the economy.

<a name="crea">Creative uncertainty</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir

VIRTUALLY no pen-pusher in the land (and this includes myself) who 
entertains some notion of being a teacher of the public has been able 
to resist the urge to pronounce upon the delay in the naming of the 
next chief of the army staff.
    
Has the republics solemn-looking president and its prime minister 
asked the incumbent, General Waheed, to continue giving the benefit of 
his leadership to the army for another year? Or, displaying a heroism 
and forbearance that hitherto have not been the leading 
characteristics of our top office-holders, is he adamant on spurning 
it?

In either case why the suspense because, after all, General Waheeds 
term as generalissimo of speculation work busily and noisily at all 
times in this country.
    
I think I can say as well as the next man that decision, especially 
regarding important matters, should be timely. Delay breeds 
uncertainty. It also affects organisational morale. But having 
conceded this, try as I might I still find the fuss being generated 
over this issue slightly baffling. As a nation our leading quality is 
not to do today what we can put off till tomorrow. Far from settling 
questions of basic national importance  questions that should have 
been settled decades ago  we have made a virtue of comprehensively 
ignoring them. What dire consequences are likely to flow if, for 
whatever reason, presidential feet are seen to be dragging on the 
question of the expected change in the army command?
    
No doubt, until this question is settled, anxiety will sit heavily on 
the hearts of those military men who are in the run for the top slot. 
As an added consequence some uncertainty is bound to prevail in GHQ. 
Such uncertainty is unhealthy. But the extent of this uncertainty 
pales before the uncertainty with which this country has had to live 
throughout its history.
    
Is anyone in a position to say where Pakistan is headed or what kind 
of a future its citizens are likely to have in the next century? Can 
anyone say with certainty whether the government we have will complete 
its term or whether the edifice of incompetence and corruption it has 
so painstakingly raised will not come crashing down on its head? Will 
the economy recover or will it continue to be at the mercy of 
mountebanks? How many more charlatans must the nation experience 
before it achieves stability and a modicum of honest leadership? If 
the nation can live with doubts regarding all these questions, it can 
survive the uncertainty that exists over General Waheeds tenure or 
the name of his likely successor.
    
Or to look at the matter from a slightly different angle. Suppose that 
three months ago the government, summoning up all its reserves of 
decisiveness, had announced the name of the new army chief. In that 
case the uncertainty gripping the political and bureaucratic 
establishment (but scarcely the people because they have other things 
to worry about) would have been pre-empted. A few generals would be 
preparing their bags to go home while others would have been polishing 
their spurs to take their places.
    
It goes without saying that we need to establish healthy precedents 
all round, not only as regards the appointment of services chiefs but 
in all other spheres of national activity. We need honest judges to 
deliver justice, competent and honest administrators to stem the rot 
of the administrative system, financial managers who can better 
understand the secrets of economic life than the present sorry lot, 
the consequences of whose actions the nation has to suffer.

The position of army chief is a powerful one in Pakistan. Not so much, 
as the naive may think, for the making of wars as for the toppling of 
governments. So what is all the fuss about? Whether the present army 
chief gets an extension, or an announcement of his replacement is made 
now or in January, Pakistan will still remain the badly governed place 
that it is now. The economic situation will remain as grim and Karachi 
will continue to be a place of strife.
    
It is strange that the process has culminated in the ineptitude 
currently on display in the form of the Benazirs government is 
scarcely the fault of the Fates who order such things. If we are 
destined to have our affairs mismanaged in this way no outside force 
can come to our deliverance.

None of this exegesis is meant to minimise the importance of healthy 
precedents or the taking of timely decisions. We badly need some 
discipline in our national life but since this is proving so hard an 
objective to achieve and since we as a nation are already reconciled 
to living from day to day, any delay in settling the question of 
General Waheeds succession, of epochal significance though it may be 
in so many respects, we will still be able to take in our stride. As a 
philosopher might say in similar circumstances, this too shall pass.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column

IN established democracies the appointment or retirement of army 
chiefs does not usually generate any earth-shaking controversy. The 
transition is smooth and accepted as a matter of course like that 
relating to any other bureaucratic office. In Pakistan, however, 
because of the fragility of our democratic institutions and the long 
spells of military rule which the country has had to suffer in the 
past, the appointment of the army chief is taken to be a matter of 
extreme moment. Thus it was hardly in the naming of a successor to 
General Abdul Waheed which set off a spate of speculation in the 
country. This has now come to an end with the naming of General 
Jehangir Karamat as the next chief of the army staff.

A number of healthy precedents have been set in the process. General 
Waheed will be stepping down from his office in time without accepting 
the extension that reportedly was offered to him by the government, 
something for which he deserves the nations thanks. Even during his 
tenure he scrupulously refrained from interfering in politics of 
breathing down the necks of politicians in power, a practice to which 
many of his predecessors in this office had been partial. He will be 
now going home in dignity and with his reputation enhanced. This 
example is no small mercy for a country dogged by a legacy of military 
ambition and unholy interventionism. For its part, general Karamats 
elevation is all the more welcome not only because he was the senior-
most officer after General Waheed but also because he enjoys a 
reputation for professional competence and personal integrity. His 
job, however, is cut out for him: to concentrate on leading the army 
and improving its professionalism while leaving the business of 
politics to the politicians. It is one of the hazards of the army 
chiefs office in this country are soon inundated with unsolicited and 
gratuitous advice about how to save the country. There has been no 
shortage of previous army commanders who have succumbed to the 
temptation of these siren calls which are sounded most often by 
retired bureaucrats and disgruntled politicians at the slightest sign 
of some tensions or conflict in political life. Hopefully, the 
incoming army chief will give such poisonous advice, if and when it is 
poured into his ears, the short shrift that it deserves.

It is also perhaps time to put an end to this troika business which 
has the Press and the political establishment so much in its thrall. 
The running of the country and the taking of major decisions is the 
province of the nations elected leaders while the army has its own 
sphere to look after. The intermingling of these roles is a major 
factor, albeit the only one, which has bred confusion in our national 
affairs and led to political instability. At the same time, however, 
it must be stated unequivocally that for democracy to take root, and 
for the military to remain confined to its rightful role, the 
countrys politicians would have to take a long and hard look at their 
own performance. They cannot make politics a byword for the pursuit of 
self-interest and yet expect the democratic tradition to flourish. For 
let us not forget that the best safeguard against praetorianism lies 
not in constitutional guarantees (since we know of what worth these 
have been in the past) but in competent and honest elective 
leadership.

Be that as it may, now that General Waheed has set an example by 
rejecting the reported extension offers made to him, let us hope that 
this becomes a precedent never to be violated, with army chiefs 
completing their tenures and stepping down and their replacements 
being announced at the proper time without the avoidable delay that 
regrettably took place in the present case.

<a name="thes">The special licence</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hafizur Rahman

FROM Germany came the news some time ago that the foreign minister of 
that country was fined for parking his car in the wrong place, and he 
paid the fine.

Obviously the people of Germany  or of any other European country for 
that matter  do not know how to pay proper respect to their 
government leaders, despite claims of having advanced so much in the 
field of public service and practice of democracy.

It is one thing to raise the level to which the ordinary people must 
be honoured in a democracy and quite another to drag leaders down to 
the plebeian level. This is something we dont do in Pakistan in spite 
of our backwardness in so many ways.

But then, we do neither of the two. We neither promote the people nor 
do we demote the leaders, howsoever dismal their record may be in 
respect of character and performance. We believe in the status quo.

One thing is certain. Had the German foreign minister been a citizen 
of Pakistan and its foreign minister, he would have been an honoured 
citizen, a VIP, and wouldnt have had to submit to the indignity of a 
traffic challan. Had he chosen to park his car in the middle of 
Islamabads Constitution Avenue or Karachis Bunder Road, and blocked 
the traffic, the police would have smiled indulgently and invited him 
to do it again the next day.

Come to think of it, I guess it would not be possible for the German 
FM to park his car anywhere in any city in this country. For the 
simple reason that his chauffeur would not permit him to do so. VVIPs 
and VIPs dont drive their cars in Pakistan. In fact, even an IP, the 
lowest category in the hierarchy (comprising mostly middle-of-order 
bureaucrats) would rather be seen dead than driving his car himself.

The other day, one of them confessed to me that he didnt know Lahore 
roads at all, although he had lived and worked in that city for many 
years. Because when his chauffeur was at the wheel he himself was 
either looking at the newspaper or reading his own noting on an 
important file.

On a visit to Sweden, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto gave a return 
banquet for the late (and the great) Olaf Palme. He had to stand in 
the porch of the Pakistan embassy for quite a while for the Swedish 
PMs car to arrive. Suddenly Mr Palme walked up to the porch, his 
greatcoat on his shoulder, and apologised for the delay. He said he 
had gone to park his car in the parking lot. But that is not our way.

The way we honour and glorify our government leaders (ministers, 
elected representatives, senior officers) is probably unmatched 
anywhere else in the world. It would be difficult to find another 
country, barring a few in Africa, which does it better.

This is by way of the perks and privileges that a grateful nation 
showers on them for condescending to take part in public life. 
Actually the nation can never repay them enough for finding time from 
their nefarious  sorry, multifarious pre-occupations to spare a few 
moments for the countrys welfare at the cost of their personal 
interest and comfort.

What we do is to issue these leaders a Special Licence which makes 
them immune from any state exaction or responsibility. During their 
tenure in office they may not only park their cars wherever they like, 
they are at liberty not to pay bills and taxes, obtain bank loans 
without surety, drive about under police escort, never be punctual at 
public functions, enjoy every entertainment free of charge, delay 
railway trains and call back PIA flights after take-off.

They can bring in any number of contraband goods from abroad, spend as 
much money from public funds as they want to, ride in three cars at 
one time, and do a host of other things which they couldnt do without 
this Special Licence. They can even get a second wife without 
fulfilling the legal provision of securing the first ones permission. 
And many of them do.

Some of the VIPs and even IPs think that the Licence is a sort of 
insurance policy which also covers death by accident  death of others 
of course, not their own. And they are right. If a man gets killed by 
their car, the fellow is usually challaned for jay-walking.

But then, in their public spirit, the VIPs are usually generous enough 
to let him off, being dead in any case. This cover-all Licence can be 
availed of by all blood relations and relations by marriage of the 
(Very) Important Person.

No description of the VIP of Pakistan will be complete without a 
mention of Mrs VIP, or rather Begum VIP. She is invariably more 
important than the burra sahib, her husband. People working in his 
office are more afraid of her than of the boss, and she makes greater 
demands on their time and attention (and sometimes their money too) 
than he does. The boss may forgive a fault or a lapse, but the Begum? 
Never.

The wives of most government leaders are brought up to believe that 
they are as much ministers and senior officers as their husbands. They 
make this quite plain to the personal staff where privileges and other 
facilities are concerned, since all these must accrue to them as a 
matter of right. After all, isnt it said that the Special Licence is 
also meant for the near and dear ones?

On their part, official leaders think of themselves as the 
governments sons-in-law, as we say in Punjabi about people who tend 
to appropriate authority. Elected or appointed by the people as 
servants of the public, they treat the people like domestic servants 
and become indignant at the slightest neglect or an imagined insult.

Witness, for example, the spate of privilege motions in the 
legislative assemblies. One feels sorry for the poor chaps whose sense 
of self-importance is hurt so easily. The only time they work really 
hard is when they are fighting for their perks and privileges.

Rifaat Hamid Ghani

MUMTAZ BHUTTO and Benazir Bhutto met and the rumour-mills havent 
stopped grinding. 
    
Why is it that rumours are such serious business here? If we realise 
that speculation is not just the pursuit of idle minds but also the 
occupation of rather thoughtful ones, it may help us understand the 
power and scope of rumour in our context. Speculation is our way of 
groping for the truth  an attempt to understand things, given the 
lack of openness that persists in our political behaviour.
    
Politicians remain over-reliant on behind-the-scenes manoeuvre and 
intrigue  and rumours are a natural corollary to speculating about 
the outcome.
    
To return to the rumour in hand: Does the prime minister want a new CM 
for Sindh, and would uncle Mumtaz be her candidate? Or does she just 
want to keep the uncle away from her brothers side till the by-
election at Sanghar is over?
    
It seems unlikely that the PM would turn to Mumtaz Bhutto as CM, given 
the fact that she likes to keep all practising chief executives in her 
pocket. Mumtaz Bhutto is not really the pocket variety bloom, for all 
that his impact is presently no more than peripheral. But perhaps the 
PM has had the wit to realise that an able administrator with a 
convincing presence would be in order.
    
Mumtaz Bhutto, the talented cousin that the greatest Bhutto of them 
all said he wouldnt do without and used as governor and chief 
minister, is no bumbling bidable novice. He would signal change in 
that the elements of his own personality and judgment, not just 
Benazirs Antschauung, would become an operative part of the political 
picture here. But he has a history of his own, and is well remembered 
for his unfriendly attitude towards Mohajirs. 
   
Aggressively Sindhi ethnicity is the warp and woof of his politics. 
The feudal in him could take over where the general in Babar leaves 
off and yet, he has recently been on terms as our quaint but highly 
expressive brand of usage has it, with Altafs men. Though most 
attributed the overtures to a desire to make things still more 
difficult for his more than talented niece.
    
Official policy in Sindh has been generally criticised for a long 
time, but the PM has been obdurate about pursuing it. Perhaps she 
really believes it is eliminating terrorists and she is doing everyone 
a good turn. 
   
Having a new CM then who was just a new bottle for the same wine would 
not mean much. If, by some happy circumstance, she is really wanting a 
new initiative of her own choosing to be put in motion, she does not 
need anyone as independent as Mumtaz Bhutto is liable to be.
    
If he were to help us out of the quagmire, he might become too much of 
a hero. And why should she upset her party by turning to someone 
outside the fold? And why be unkind to Abdullah Shah?

This has been such a bloody year for Karachi. And it draws to an end 
without much sign that the bloodiness too will be over.
    
Rumour-mongering and speculation are not healthy signs. But there 
might be still more cause for alarm were rumours to stop because 
speculation had given way to a realisation that the administration has 
exhausted its options and has nothing left to pull out of its bag of 
tricks ... We could be closer than we suspect to that stage of dull, 
dangerous despair.
    
N.B I stand rather interestingly corrected  the PM was already able 
to sign chits at the Sindh Club as its sole female member, in her very 
own right. The committee rapidly conferred honorary status after she 
dropped in as PM with her old school friends and signed a chit, 
forgetting she was now Mrs Zardari, not Miss Bhutto. Perhaps everyone 
remembered she was PM?

<a name="banl">Ban lifted from Qasim Umer</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 20: The seven-year ban imposed on former Test batsman 
Qasim Umer in 1985 has been lifted by the Pakistan Cricket Board 
(PCB), well informed sources said.
    
The decision was taken by the four-member Disciplinary Committee which 
met under the Chairmanship of Nasimul Ghani. The Disciplinary 
Committee, which also comprise Nusrat Azeem, Ejaz Yousuf and Amir 
Hayat Rokhri, has recommended to the PCB to allow Umer to resume 
cricket with immediate effect.
    
It has also advised the board that Umer could be employed by any 
department if they wanted his services as he would be getting a 
clearance letter with regard to this decision.
    
Qasim Umer, the Kenya-born right-handed dashing batsman, was banned by 
the board led by Lt Gen Safdar Butt after he alleged that leading 
Pakistan cricketers, including Imran Khan, were smuggling drugs in 
their cricket gears.
    
He had made these remarks in an interview to the government-run agency 
after the team returned from the tour of Australia.
    
Similar charges were levelled against Imran Khan by Younis Ahmad after 
the team returned from the historic tour of India where it won the 
Bangalore Test. However, no disciplinary action was taken against the 
left-hander.
    
Umer, who was then 28, not only lost cricket at the prime of his 
career, he was also sacked on disciplinary grounds by his 
organisation, Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB) which, according to the 
batsman, have not cleared his dues yet.
    
Sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, stated that although the 
ban had to expire in 1992, the then Secretary of the BCCP, Shahid 
Rafi, did not lift it. The reason for this is best known to Mr Rafi.
    
The sources admitted that Qasim Umer appealed to the cricket board on 
not lesser than half a dozen occasions through letters but all his 
applications were put in a pending file.
    
Qasim Umer also appealed twice to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) 
which forwarded his request to the Disciplinary Committee to action.
    
Though the ban has been lifted now, it would be anybodys guess 
whether Qasim Umer would ever return to the arena at the age of 38. 
However, the only benefit from the lifting of the ban will be that he 
will return to Pakistan, settle here and may find a honourable job for 
his livelihood.

<a name="bowl">Bowlers demolish N.Z in Pakistans 1-day win</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed

DUNEDIN, Dec.15: Despite a low score to defend, Pakistan pacemen Waqar 
Younis and Wasim Akram bowled admirably to inflict a severe blow to 
New Zealand in the first of the three one-day internationals at 
Carisbrook. The two picked up six wickets between them to bowl New 
Zealand for 169 after they were set a challenging 190 to win in 50 
overs.
    
Pakistans 20-run victory was achieved with two balls still remaining 
of the 48th over. New Zealand had lost their five wickets for only 50 
runs scored and the next three wickets with 64 more runs added.
    
With only two wickets remaining and only 114 runs on the board, the 
game was as good as over. But ninth wicket partnership of 50 runs 
between Roger Twose and Cavin Larsen changed all that.
    
The score started to mount and in the last four overs 26 more runs 
were required for New Zealand to win. Larsen and Twose, who made 59, 
were well on course to stage an upset but Wasim Akram dismissed them 
both to clinch a win from the jaws of a possible defeat.

Waqar Younis in an inspired spell dented the middle order by taking 
three wickets in quick succession and saw Wasim Akram Mushtaq Ahmed 
and Aqib Javed take it up from where he had left. it was a thoroughly 
professional performance by the Pakistan bowlers who were regrettably 
let down by their batsmen.
    
After having won the toss and batted on a slow wicket and of low 
bounce Pakistan were restricted to 189 runs with Ramiz Raja, the top 
scorer with 35. Nothing to be proud of but the bowlers stuck to their 
task superbly and were well aided by some good catching and ground 
work.
    
In only the second over, Craig Spearman was caught at point by Ijaz 
Ahmed off Aqib Javed, the only change in the side from the one-off 
Test. With only 16 runs scored Wasim Akram took a catch off his own 
bowling to get rid of Nathan Astle. both the batsmen made only 5 runs 
each.

With Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed brought into the attack in the 
ninth and tenth over, there were further heart-aches to follow. 
Stephen Fleming playing across to Waqar was leg before having made 15. 
Bryan young played onto his wicket when he attempted a drive off the 
same bowler and Adam Parore had his stumps shattered with a swinging 
Yorker. From 2 for 43, New Zealand slumped to 5 for 50.
    
Had a difficult catch at the wicket off Waqar not dropped when Roger 
Twose had not even scored, things could have been rather gloomier for 
New Zealand. Twose, alongwith Chris Cairns, took the score to 92 
adding 42 runs for the sixth wicket.
    
A crafty delivery from Mushtaq found Cairns edge into the keepers 
gloves when he had made 18. When Lee Germon stepped out to drive 
Mushtaq, the ball found its way into the slips where Wasim Akram took 
a comfortable catch and Dipak Patel pulled Salim Malik to be caught at 
deep mid-wicket by Basit Ali.

It was now left to Twose and Larsen to do or die. They did well to 
delay the demise and add 50 runs for the ninth wicket.
    
Wasim Akram, back in the attack, hurried their end. New Zealand 
perished but not without credit. They did make a fight of it and Twose 
for his 59, his third successive half century against the tourists, 
did bring some respectability to the hosts in defeat.
    
Pakistans batting earlier on was as much embarrassing. For the first 
wicket Ramiz Raja and Aamir Sohail put on 31 runs and for the third 
wicket 30 runs were added between Ramiz Raja and Inzamam-ul-Haq. In 
between there was not much to be proud of except that Rashid Latif 
chipped in with an unbeaten 26. Ramiz 35, Inzamam 32 were the other 
two batsmen who did show some resistance. Basit Ali and Wasim Akram 
were run out of direct throws from Adam Parore while taking quick 
singles. For Pakistan it was an uneventful innings.
    
If not for the effort of its bowlers, the 1-0 lead in the four-match 
series would not have been possible.

<a name="newz">New Zealand beat Pakistan in nail-biting finish</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed

CHRISTCHURCH, Dec.17: The second one-day turned out to be a cliff-
hanger. New Zealand chasing a formidable target of 233 to win in 50 
overs reached the target on the last ball of the day to beat Pakistan 
by one wicket and avenged their defeat suffered at Carisbrook.
    
The match could have even ended in a tie had Wasim Akram not bowled 
the last ball of the day outside the off stump which Gavin Larsen 
steered towards boundary through the third man region.
    
In fact it was the last over of the day which snatched the victory 
away from Pakistan. Nine runs were needed for a tie and ten for a win. 
The Pakistan captain would have been the last man to have allowed that 
to happen after nine wickets had already fallen and he had the ball 
all to himself to bowl New Zealand out or to contain them. Neither 
happened.
    
The last man Danny Morrison picked up a leg-bye on the first ball. The 
next, a no-ball, was edged by Gavin Larsen past the keeper for two 
which was followed by a scorching drive through the covers for four. 
On the fourth delivery he survived a leg before appeal, the fifth did 
not produce any run, the sixth yielded another two runs off a no-ball 
to tie the game and the sixth was promptly sent to the ropes.
    
Astonishingly it was the worst over that Wasim Akram bowled on this 
tour which let New Zealand off the hook. The last-over drama was 
preceded by an eventful over by Waqar Younis who is four balls had 
taken three wickets in his last over to bring Pakistan near to an 
exciting win. On his second delivery of his tenth and last over, he 
had Lee Germon caught at covers by Basit Ali for 5. On the fourth 
Dipak Patel was taken at deep point by Ijaz Ahmed without scoring and 
on the fifth ball he had Roger Twose caught at mid-off by Mushtaq 
Ahmed for 10.
    
New Zealand after being 220 for 6 in the 49th over had slumped to 221 
for 9. But the last over of the day changed all that.

New Zealands victory bid was earlier aided by two very productive 
partnerships for the third and fifth wickets which yielded 77 and 97 
runs respectively.
    
After Aqib Javed had both Craig Spearman and Nathan Astle caught at 
the wicket by Rashid Latif with only 21 runs scored. Stephen Fleming 
and Bryan Young and taken the score to 98 before Fleming was the third 
man out having made 48 with five fours. Sweeping Aamir Sohail he was 
bowled round his legs. Two overs later Young also left when Wasim 
Akram at cover took a well-judged catch off the same bowler when 34.
    
Adam Parore was then dropped at 16 by Basit Ali when he pulled Aamir 
Sohail to mid-wicket. New Zealand were then 133 for 4 in the 334th 
over. he and Chris Cairns batted steadily for 23 overs without hitting 
a single four to establish their match-winning stand of 97 for the 
fifth wicket.
    
Wasim Akram dismissed them both but not before Parore had made 45 and 
Cairns 54.

Victory for Pakistan seemed assured when Waqar Younis struck taking 
three wickets in one over. But in the end it was all in vain.
    
Pakistan earlier on had decided to bat after winning the toss and had 
lost Aamir Sohail and Ramiz Raja both with 27 runs on the board. 
Sohail was caught at short cover by Spearman for 10 and Ramiz Raja 
provided Danny Morrison with his 100th wicket in the one-day 
internationals. Ijaz Ahmed missed a full toss from Cairns to be leg 
before for 14.
    
But Inzamam-ul-Haq and Salim Malik batted sensibly to put on 114 runs 
for the fourth wicket. The Man of the Match Inzamam was bowled through 
his legs for a superb 80.
    
He had hit six fours and a six off Larsen. Malik made 58 which was his 
first score of over fifty on the tour, faced 82 balls and appeared in 
great form before falling to Twose.

Wasim Akram was yorked by Morrison for 10 in the 46th over and later 
Morrison had Rashid Latif, Waqar Younis and Basit Ali in one over to 
finish with 5 for 46, his best bowling in one-day matches. In his last 
spell he had four wickets in three overs for 18 runs.

WELLINGTON, Dec.20: Pakistans 54-run victory in the third one-day 
international against New Zealand at the Basin Reserve was marred by 
act of indiscipline by two Pakistan players Aqib Javed and Mushtaq 
Ahmed, who were both fined by the Sri Lankan match referee Ranjan 
Madugalle.
    
Aqib Javed was fined 50 per cent of his match fee and Mushtaq Ahmed 10 
per cent for showing dissent to an opposing player and an umpire. The 
incidents occurred during a run chase by the New Zealand batsmen who 
were left to score a daunting 262 runs to take the lead in the four 
match series.
    
Having won a leg before decision against Adam Parore by umpire Evan 
Watkin after the batsman had struck a four off him on the previous 
delivery, Aqib dashed down the wicket in his follow-through charging 
at the batsman in anger to tell him off in no uncertain manner as 
Parore turned to walk away. Aqibs team-mates had to restrains the 
bowler and had to hush him away in case he went out of control.
    
And Mushtaq Ahmed, who was deprived of a caught and bowled decision 
against the New Zealand captain Lee Germon by umpire Evan Watkin, had 
signalled to umpire Steve Dunne to have a third umpire version of a 
stumping by Rashid Latif off him, after Dunne had categorically passed 
a judgement of the batsman Stephen Fleming being not out.
    
In a way Mushtaq Ahmed was giving vent to his feeling of injustice 
after he was denied a wicket by umpire Watkin earlier. But he should 
have known better and should have behaved himself. After all the match 
was fully in Pakistans grip.
    
It seems that Aqib Javed has not learnt his lesson from two earlier 
convictions by batch referees. This is Wasims third offence for which 
he has been penalised.
    
Pakistan despite poor umpiring and even poorer fielding bowled New 
Zealand out for 207 after having scored 261 for 4 after being put in.
    
Craig Spearman and Nathan Astle in only the eighth over had taken the 
score to 48 but then three wickets fell within four balls on that 
score and New Zealand lost their way.
 
Spearman, who had struck three fours off Aqib Javed and two more later 
during his innings of 33, was caught one-handed by Aamir Sohail at 
cover off Wasim Akram and Bryan Young was out on the next ball. In the 
next over Astle hit one in the air to mid-off to be caught by Ramiz 
Raja off Aqib Javed. Wasim Akram was on a hat-trick in his next over 
but the bowled one outside the leg stump of Stephen Fleming.

Roger Twose, who made 37 and was the seventh man out, should have been 
given out caught when he had not scored. A chest-high delivery was 
hooked to long-leg where Mushtaq took a brilliant catch but umpire 
Dunne in his own wisdom declared a no-ball. Anything over the 
batsmans shoulder is declared a no-ball, but that delivery from Waqar 
Younis was not.
    
Twose and Fleming later put on 47 runs for the fifth wicket after 
Parore was dismissed by Aqib. In a mix-up Chris Cairns was run out and 
when Twose and Dipak Patel were also gone, New Zealand with 166 for 8 
in the 37th over were already in the dump.
    
Gavin Larsen survived only five deliveries but the last wicket stand 
of Germon and Morrison added 33 runs before New Zealand were all out.
    
Earlier Pakistan after being put in were given a solid start of 51 
runs by Aamir Sohail and Ramiz Raja. Ramiz was run out for 21 but 
Aamir Sohail in 83 balls scored 58 runs with the help of six fours to 
add 56 runs with Ijaz Ahmed before being bowled by Larsen.
    
Ijaz Ahmed and Inzamam-ul-Haq later shared 31 runs for the third 
wicket. Inzamam, the dominant of the two, made a polished 54, his 
second successive so in the one-day series. There were six fours in 
his innings, which was attractive and entertaining. With Salim Malik 
who made 42 he also had added 79 very valuable runs for the fourth 
wicket.
    
Malik and Wasim Akram later blasted 44 runs for the unbroken fifth 
wicket partnership. Wasims share of that stand being 36 glorious 
runs. In fifteen balls he had struck three fours and two sixes off 
Cairns and Morrison.
