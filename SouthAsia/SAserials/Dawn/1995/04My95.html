------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By A Correspondent

KARACHI, April 28: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan may 
constitute an international team to verify alleged excesses against 
activists of Mohajir Qaumi Movement, HRCP conference sources said.

This was stated by HRCP chairperson Asma Jehangir on Friday when a 
two-member MQM delegation, led by its deputy leader in the Sindh 
Assembly, apprised foreign delegates attending the regional 
conference on human rights of the alleged violations of human rights 
by the state apparatus, and sought their intervention in this regard, 
said the sources.

Delegates from India, Sri Lanka Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan 
expressed deep concern over the presentation, during which the MQM 
delegation also distributed copies of the 1000-page petition filed 
before the Supreme Court.

The HRCP chairperson explained that "while allegations levelled by 
the MQM are serious, at the same time equally serious allegations 
have been levelled against the MQM as well.

"Such a controversial situation cannot be taken up without proper 
verification," she said and emphasised that "owing to political 
polarisation and fear of violence, verification can only be carried 
out by an international mediation team."


The MQM delegation agreed to cooperate with any such team which would 
be nominated by the HRCP, and as such the HRCP chairperson promised 
to consult to executives and thereafter proceed in the matter, the 
sources said.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, April 29: The three-day regional conference on human rights 
on Saturday called upon governments to make prevalence the rule of 
law and independent judicial system their primary concern and urged 
the countries of the region refrain from mutual hostilities and proxy 
wars.

The Karachi Declaration issued at the end of the conference resolved 
that the tendency of the governments to suppress or punish dissent 
was wholly unacceptable and should be eschewed.

"A state should be secular and engender a secular outlook in 
society," the conference emphasised and added that "it should 
strictly follow a non-discriminatory policy in all respects."

Regretting that "governments tend to express human rights concerns 
selectively and for political objectives" it emphasised the need for 
finding quick and effective remedies against incidence or tendency 
towards intolerance. "The role of judiciary should be strengthened 
towards this end," it said.

The conference also called upon the countries of the region to 
"refrain from mutual hostilities, cold or proxy wars and negative 
propaganda and proceed to defuse existing tensions and preferably use 
mediation, where necessary, of other countries of the region."

The conference emphasised the need for promoting people to people 
relations, especially among the youth and professional groups, and 
cultural exchanges of all categories.

The conference further resolved that "anti-terrorist laws have served 
more to victimise innocent people than to end civilian discontent or 
militancy." "A government does not need this addition to its armoury 
to combat any terrorism that exist in its society," the declaration 
said.

It expressed grave concern over the threat posed by intolerance to 
stability and development within the countries and to cooperation and 
peace in the region.

It noted that intolerance also often bitterly divides a community 
against itself, of which Karachi was one of the current examples.

It also called upon the countries of SAARC to set up committees to 
address problems of intolerance in the region.

It also called upon them to ratify the core international covenant 
protocols, and conventions like CEDAW and the convention against 
torture and bring their domestic legislations in line with these 
instruments.

It resolved to work towards peaceful and speedy resolution of 
conflicts born of poverty, racism gender discrimination, crime and 
all forms of violence; to fight against violation of rights, 
including the rights of the child, and to promote good relations 
between the people of the region.

The declaration called upon human rights NGOs to promote the idea of 
a regional charter and a regional court of human rights and to press 
their governments in that direction.

The conference also called for setting up a South Asian People's 
tribunal for child rights as a nongovernment body registered with 
SAARC secretariat to take note of violations and abuse and monitor 
implementation of the convention of the rights of the child.

At the end the conference adopted two resolutions. One of them 
expressed its deep concern at the human rights situation in Bhutan, 
especially the plight of more than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees.

It resolved that expulsion of thousands of Bhutanese citizen and 
arbitrary detention of political dissenters and human rights 
defenders were manifestations of intolerance.

Calling for release of "all political poisoners immediately, and 
unconditionally the conference urged the Royal Government of Bhutan 
to immediately facilitate the return of Bhutanese refugees from the 
neighbouring countries.

Through another resolution, the conference expressed satisfaction 
over the call given by the parliament of Sri Lanka and the demand 
made by the Prime Minister of Pakistan that the Burmese state law and 
order restoration council immediately release Daw Aung San Suu Kyi 
>from  her six years of house arrest, along with all other political 
prisoners.

<a name="laws">S<b>pecial laws required to protect human rights: PM</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, April 27: Reaffirming her commitment to the ideals and 
objectives of human rights, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Thursday 
emphasised the need for creating public awareness, constitutional 
amendment and special laws for special situation as the rights of 
citizens were under attack from forces of tyranny, extremism and 
terrorism.

"To protect human rights, we need to create public awareness and 
forge unity to defeat the forces of darkness which seek to obliterate 
the light of civilisation," she said while inaugurating a three-day 
regional conference on "Human Rights and Tolerance, An Asian 
Perspective."

Ms Bhutto said tolerance and human rights were enshrined in the 
principles of Islam and these were at the heart of human dignity.

She said human rights must include the right to worship according to 
one's belief because such freedom was at the heart of Islam and at 
the core of Pakistan's founding principles.

Human rights, she said, also concerned the fundamental freedoms, 
including the freedom to speak without fear, to work without 
discrimination, to engage in political activities and to decide the 
destiny of their nations through free, fair and impartial elections 
held at regular intervals.

She said that unfortunately in present-day society, there are 
vigilante groups, who seek to exact revenge for themselves and take 
the law in their own hands although in a civilised society the law 
must take its own course.

Defending the laws her government recently promulgated to deal with 
acts of terrorism, Ms Bhutto said special laws were required to deal 
with such crimes because under the existing laws it was difficult to 
convict murderers of innocent people as they got bailed out.

"We are committed to protecting human rights but at the same time, we 
are detained to eradicate crime and not let the hardened criminals go 
scot-free," said the Prime Minister.

She expressed confidence that soon people would realise the 
significance of the law.

<a name="char"><b>SAARC may consider change in charter</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Mahmood Zaman

NEW DELHI, April 30: The eighth SAARC summit begins here on Tuesday 
to consider an amendment to its charter to make room for bilateral 
resolution of outstanding conflicts in the region and suggest 
measures to improve cooperation.

After the first day's informal meeting in the morning, held to 
finalise the summit declaration Pakistan Foreign Minister Sardar 
Assef Ahmed Ali told reporters that "a feeling had emerged among the 
member-states to review the SAARC charter, keeping pace with needs 
and requirements for the second decade of the seven-nation regional 
body. What is being felt is the need to suggest a mechanism to 
resolve conflicts among the member-states through bilateral talks."

The SAARC charter, approved in 1985,does not provide for raising 
bilateral issues. The move to amend the charter could only meet with 
success if there is unanimity of view on the need to change the 10 
year old document.

Sunday's meeting of foreign ministers also decided that the SAARC 
Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA), approved during the seventh 
summit conference in Dhaka, would be ratified by Dec 8 this year. 

Replying to a question, Mr Ali said Pakistan's stand on Kashmir was 
based on principles and President Leghari was to take up the matter 
with Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao when the latter would call 
upon the President. He said New Delhi should also take into account 
the price it was paying to keep the issue boiling. Both India and 
Pakistan were poor states and must set their priorities keeping in 
view the cost of armaments, nuclear, missile and conventional, and 
the grave conditions of poverty among their people.

During the first session of foreign ministers conference, emphasis 
was on economic and social issues which the heads of state and 
government would discuss in the light of far-reaching global changes 
which had taken place in the recent past. The session showed the same 
spirit of consensus and cooperation that had characterised the 
previous meetings.

Pakistan, the foreign minister said, was fully committed to the SAARC 
process and had contributed to the evolution of the association and 
its on-going projects under the integrated programme of action.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Mahmood Zaman

NEW DELHI, May 2: President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari discussed 
Kashmir and other issues of bilateral interest when he met Indian 
Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao here on Tuesday after the inaugural 
session of the SAARC summit, which began at the elegant Vigyan Bhavan 
Conference hall.

After their first meeting, which lasted about 50 minutes, President 
Leghari said in the presence of the Indian Prime Minister that he had 
discussed with Mr Rao "the core issue, that is Kashmir, and we have 
felt that the dispute must be resolved through peaceful means and not 
by military means".

The two leaders were aided in bilateral talks by their foreign 
ministers and diplomats. "India also wishes so (that the Kashmir 
dispute should be resolved peacefully) and wants to discuss the issue 
at all levels, political, intellectual and other fora", the president 
added.

President Leghari said both the countries had felt that despite the 
positions taken by them on the Kashmir question, it was necessary 
that talks must continue and no side should feel hesitant on this 
question. He said talks should take place at levels other than the 
official level. He said he had apprised the Indian Prime Minister of 
Pakistan's concern over atrocities being committed in Kashmir and the 
desire that a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir question be found.

Responding to a question, Mr Rao said he agreed with President 
Leghari's view that negotiations must continue.

To another question, he said he would not rule out the possibility of 
having discussed Kashmir.

Replying to a question on the Indian government's plans to hold 
elections in Kashmir, President Leghari said Pakistan believed that 
elections there would be meaningless in the presence of troops and 
when atrocities were being perpetrated on Kashmiris. But, he said, 
the question of elections in Kashmir was not raised during their 
talks.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Athar Ali

LONDON, April 27: While talks between the Sindh government and the 
local leaders of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement are continuing, there 
cannot be any prospect of direct talks with MQM leader Altaf Hussain 
who is living here in self imposed exile.

This was stated by a two-man team of Karachi politicians sent to 
Britain by the government to explain to the Pakistani community and 
also British members of parliament the reasons for the deterioration 
in law and order situation in Sindh. Senator Kamal Azfar and Mr Iqbal 
Yusuf on Wednesday met the junior minister at the Foreign Office, Mr 
Tony Baldry, who had recently led a trade mission to Pakistan.

Iqbal Yusuf, adviser to the Sindh chief minister, said there was a 
lack of commitment in the country to the problems of urban areas. He 
said that the local MQM leaders, with whom the Sindh government had 
been negotiating, lacked the will to take vital decisions and were 
almost a "hostage" to Altaf Hussain.

He said a great deal of understanding had to be created in order to 
tackle the situation in Karachi which, he believed, was also being 
exploited by foreign elements.

<a name="benc"><b>Nawaz seeks trial by larger bench</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 30: Former prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif has 
challenged the trial of plots reference against him in the special 
court under the President's Order 16 of 1977 and requested that his 
constitutional petition in this behalf be heard by 'a larger bench of 
senior judges," of the Lahore High Court.

In particular, the petition says, the special court order summoning 
him to appear and answer the charge on May 8 should be declared to be 
"without lawful authority and of no legal effect."

The petition challenges the special court order dismissing the 
accused's plea for acquittal before the framing of charge under 
Section 265(K) of the Criminal Procedure Code and mostly reiterates 
the arguments advanced in favour of the discharge application before 
the special court.

Though the petition is mainly directed against the dismissal of the 
discharge application under Section 265(K), it challenges the very 
assumption of jurisdiction by the special court "as the 
jurisdictional facts, the objective existence of which is essential 
for such assumption, are missing from the case." The order suffers 
>from  the lack of jurisdiction, the petition alleges.

Citing the special court, the interior ministry and the LDA director-
general as respondents, Mr Sharif alleged that he was being subjected 
to a systematic campaign of victimisation "intended to annihilate him 
economically and to oust him from the political seen.

"The sharp sting of confrontation has been converted into personal 
animosity and has culminated into launching of malicious criminal 
proceedings" against him under Article 3 of the Holders of 
Representative Offices (Punishment for Misconduct) Order (XVI of 
1977).

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Our Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, May 3: There are credible reports of support by the 
Government of Pakistan for Kashmiri militants, a report released by 
the US State Department on patterns of global terrorism in 1994 has 
claimed.

The report compiled for the year 1994 said in its overview of Asia 
that Pakistan continued to provide support to some of the freedom 
fighters in Indian-occupied Kashmir.

The official US statement contained in the report denies Pakistani 
claims that it was helping the Kashmiris through moral, political and 
diplomatic support.

Coming within days after Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit to 
Washington, the report negates Pakistani claims that her visit had 
brought Washington closer to the Pakistani point of view on Kashmir.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had claimed on arrival back from 
Washington that Pakistan's position on Kashmir had been vindicated in 
her US visit.

The report devotes two paragraphs to India and three to Pakistan but 
the charge that Pakistan was helping the Kashmiris officially has 
been repeated in both the sections.

In its comments on Pakistan, the report says "The Government of 
Pakistan acknowledges that it continues to give moral, political and 
diplomatic support to Kashmiri militants but denies allegations of 
other assistance. There were credible reports in 1994, however, of 
official Pakistani support to Kashmiri militants. Some support came 
>from  private organisations such as the Jamaat-i-Islami.

<a name="chak"><b>Chakwal station to be operated by Pakistanis</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD,April 27:The proposed UN-sponsored Chakwal seismic station, 
which is yet to be built, would not be capable of monitoring 
Pakistan's nuclear programme or other sensitive installations, 
Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali told a group of senior 
journalists at the foreign office here on Thursday.

Assisted by senior officials from his ministry and top technical 
personnel from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission(PAEC),the 
foreign minister explained that the centre, which would be equipped 
with about 200,000 dollars worth of US-made state-of- the-art 
equipment, would be capable only of detecting earthquakes and manmade 
underground explosions, including low-intensity tests, with high 
precision.

He conceded, however that the UN sponsorship of the seismic system 
was related to the implementation of a global verification under the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty(CTBT) as and when it was successfully 
negotiated and came into force.

Appealing to the Press not to perceive a sell-out where there was 
none, the minister said India, Iran and China already had this 
capability, and '-our participation in the global exercise will, 
therefore, enable Pakistan to match this capability with India."

He said the station would be manned, maintained and operated entirely 
by Pakistan engineers and technicians.

He said neither Iran nor China had protested to Pakistan officially 
on the matter and added that "delay in launching of our 
Array(station)has been caused due to postponement in the supply of 
equipment donated by the US and Norway."

Answering a question, he said since it was an UN-sponsored 
installation, the supply of the highly sophisticated equipment from 
the US for the station would not come under the purview of the 
Pressler law.

Technical experts said the Chakwal site was selected because it had 
granite rocky surface, an ideal platform for setting up such a 
station. They said Pakistan had 100 per cent data-collection 
capability but it faced some limitations on the score of analysis. 
But here, too, there were offers from the international organisation 
to train Pakistan scientists in the art of data analysis. All data 
collected would go to the Data Centre in Washington during the 
experimental period. After experimental period of two years was over, 
Pakistan would not be obliged to send the data for analysis any 
where, they added.

*From  Our Correspondent

LONDON, April 29: An "early day motion" has been tabled before the 
House of Commons urging the British government "to assist the 
government of Pakistan in every way to combat crime and violence."

The motion has so far been signed by 40 members belonging to all the 
three main political parties. The move has been sponsored by Labour 
member of parliament, Max Madden.

The Labour MP feels the majority of his Pakistani constituents 
condemn without reservation religious hatred and religious 
intolerance wherever and however it occurs in Pakistan. They want 
those responsible for sectarian violence, including murder, arson and 
bomb attacks, to be brought to justice without delay.

The 'early day motion' urges members of British Parliament to use 
their influence on political parties in Pakistan to support any 
legislation brought before the National Assembly to repeal or reform 
the blasphemy laws introduced under martial law.

KARACHI, April 29: Defence Minister Aftab Shahban Mirani said here on 
Saturday that Pakistan planned to induct mine-hunters in the navy 
with transfer of technology for their construction in the country. 
Mr. Mirani said these mine hunters would also include the Eridan 
class.

Speaking as the chief guest at the rebuild completion ceremony at 
Pakistan Navy Submarine at PNS Abdoze ground, PN dockyard, Mr Mirani 
said the government was not oblivious of the naval requirements of 
the country.

He said that the government was striving to encourage indigenous 
production of defence equipment, as no country could depend entirely 
on outside sources for its defence requirements.

He said that a second naval harbour at Ormara was already under 
construction and would prove to be a valuable asset for the country 
on completion. Similarly, Jinnah Naval Base would have refit and 
rebuild yard and would be an important stride towards self-reliance 
and indigenous construction he added.

He said that Pakistan had recently acquired the Type-21 frigates from 
Britain as an interim measure to fill the gap due to the unexpected 
return of frigates leased from the US.

He said that Pakistan Navy was in the process of acquiring modern and 
state-of-the-art submarines from France which is expected to 
substantially improve the strike capability of the Navy.

Council of Minsisters, has said that the EU "does not believe in 
unilateral embargoes". EU officials in Brussels say the Union intends 
to continue its "critical dialogue" with Tehran.

Of the 15 EU states, France, Germany and Britain have said clearly 
that they will not follow the American initiative. German Economic 
Minister Guenter Rexrodt said in a radio interview that Bonn did not 
believe that a trade embargo is "the appropriate instrument for 
influencing opinion in Iran".

"The right thing to do is to conduct a political dialogue with Iran," 
Rexrodt added. "Only political dialogue can bring Iran to behave 
responsibly."

A British Foreign Office spokesman said London maintained a policy of 
"critical dialogue" with Iran, but denied allegation of a rift 
between the EU and the US on the issue.

But, EU officials say that President Clinton's decision to cut off 
trade and investment ties with Iran has taken the Union by surprise.

According to French diplomats the EU was not consulted by the 
Americans although Washington is clearly seeking European support in 
its policy vis-a-vis Iran.

The EU has made clear that despite pressure from the US it has no 
intention of curbing the activities of private European businessmen 
in Iran.

EU officials say that while the Union has often denounced Iran's 
flouting of international law, and specially the death sentence 
passed on British author Salman Rushdie, there are no plans to freeze 
relations with Tehran.

"We intend to leave all lines of communication open with a country 
which is an important trading partner and an important regional 
power," an official commented.

"We are attentive on all issues that relate to human rights and the 
respect of international law," the Commission spokesman said.

According to statistics published by the European Commission, the 
bilateral trade flows between the E.U. and Iran were valued at over 
14 billion dollars in 1993. The E.U. imported goods worth 7 billion 
dollars from Iran, with oil accounting for 6 billion dollars of the 
total.

<a name="vict"><b>Extortion victim speaks out</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 3: A prominent city industrialist who claimed to have 
been the victim of extortion for the last few months, went public on 
Wednesday by accusing Mohajir Qaumi Movement (Haqiqi) chief Afaq 
Ahmed Khan and his party of carrying out Tuesday's Rs 4.3 million 
robbery at his mills and extorting money from other industrialists.

Farooq Summar, 46, the former chairman of All Pakistan Textile Mills 
Association (Sindh-Balochistan Zone) and the owner of Rs 1,000-
million Mohammad Farooq Textile Mills in Korangi, unfolded a series 
of events.

Mr Sumar, who is also the chairman of the National Textile 
Foundation, said after a daylight robbery at his Korangi factory on 
Tuesday afternoon, an anonymous telephone call later in the night and 
police refusal to register a case against Afaq Ahmed Khan, he had 
decided to tell the people "every thing."

Giving the details, Mr Sumar said the Haqiqi leaders started giving 
him and his employees threats when he started resisting frequent 
demands for cash by the party which had become larger and more 
frequent during the last seven to eight months.

Mr Sumar claimed that the police were performing the role of a silent 
spectator and were unwilling to take any action against the Haqiqi 
activists. "We have to force the government to stop supporting 
criminals and their activities. There is not just terrorism in 
Karachi. In my view it is political terrorism, opposition terrorism, 
agency terrorism, and religious terrorism," he said.

"The government should not ignore economic and business activity in 
Pakistan just because billions of dollars are coming from abroad, but 
billions of dollars are already invested in Karachi," he added.

The MQM Haqiqi, he alleged, instigated, planned and executed the 
Tuesday's robbery since he had not given in to their earlier attempts 
to extort money.

<a name="role"><b>Pakistan may play key role in US-Iran row</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, May 3: Pakistan is likely to assume a crucial role, both 
for Iran and the United States, following the declaration of a trade 
war by President Clinton against the oil-rich country he describes as 
a "rogue state."

"We will have to play an important role because we might just be the 
only country which could act as a bridge between these two embattled 
states,"  a senior Pakistan diplomat said.

But Pakistani diplomats dismissed fears that the strong association 
of Islamabad with Tehran could bring some negative fallout of the 
trade embargo for Pakistan as well.

"Pakistan and the United States have reached that level of mutual 
understanding which automatically defines many parameters and there 
is not likely to be any misunderstanding on that count," the senior 
Pakistan diplomat told Dawn.

But some circles fear that Pakistan could face pressures from 
Washington if the trade war escalated and Washington had to face the 
continued cold response to the embargo from its major allies and 
friends, as witnessed in initial reactions round the globe.

These circles believe that Pakistan was already the closest 
geographic, physical and ideological link between the rest of the 
world and Iran.

In the face of a trade ban, followed by other economic sanctions it 
would automatically become a religious and national duty of Pakistan 
to provide Iran with whatever it could to defy the ban, these circles 
believe.

They hope that Washington would show a sense of understanding and 
would not treat any assistance and help by the Pakistani people to 
Iranians as a gesture of defiance by the government of Pakistan 
against the trade sanctions on Tehran.

Diplomatic observers are sure that Washington would be viewing the 
growing economic ties between Pakistan and Iran, specially the talk 
of a gas pipeline from the Gulf through Iran, Pakistan and eventually 
India, with suspicion.

The general reaction to the trade embargo against Iran has been 
negative and already US media have started describing the Clinton 
move as a disaster.

Senior columnist Arnaud de Borchgrave said in The Washington Times on 
Wednesday that United States "now finds itself isolated on both the 
Iraqi oil sanctions and the Iranian trade ban."

Former US Secretary of State Alexander Haig opposed the ban strongly 
and echoed reactions from Europe, Japan and other moderate Arab 
states which had rejected the embargo.

"There are two major Gulf powers, Iran and Iraq, and it makes no 
geopolitical sense to treat these two traditional rivals for 
influence as co-equal enemies of the United States," Haig told the 
Washington Times.

He even quoted the Israeli reaction to the trade ban and said the 
Rabin government believes that a total boycott of Iran could make 
renewed terrorism a self-fulfilling prophecy.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 27:The Privatisation Commission has selected British 
company Morgan Grenfell as the financial advisers for the sale of 26 
per cent shares, along with the transfer of management control to a 
strategic investor, of the state-run Pakistan Telecommunication 
Corporation, an official announcement said on Thursday.

The short-listed companies, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs of the 
United States and Britain's Morgan Grenfell, had contested for the 
position. The bids were opened on April 10 and their offers were 
assessed by the Privatisation Commission.

"Morgan Grenfell, in collaboration with Coopers and Lybrand, Denton 
Hall, Muslim Commercial Bank and Abacus Consulting, have been 
selected as the financial advisers for the second phase of 
privatisation of the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation," a Press 
release issued by the Privatisation Commission said.

The government intends to convert the PTC into a public limited 
company by December 1995 when the management would be transferred to 
a strategic investor.

Morgan Grenfell is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Deutsche Bank 
Group and has acted as financial advisers to different governments on 
four telecom privatisations involving the sale of a shareholding to a 
strategic investor.

<a name="trus"><b>Criminal breach of trust</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

ONE just cannot condone waste, any waste. And, one must not, under 
any circumstances, condone the criminal waste of public funds, and 
the use of such funds for private gain or personal glorification. The 
funds belonging to a nation and its people constitute a "sacred 
trust". In our case, the prime trustee of that trust, the Prime 
Minister, is primarily responsible for ensuring that the funds held 
in trust are not misused.

Relevant safeguards pertaining to this trust are enshrined in the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. For example.

"Preamble "Whereas sovereignty over the entire Universe belongs to 
Almighty Allah alone, and the authority to be exercised by the people 
of Pakistan within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust; 
"And whereas it is the will of the people of Pakistan to establish an 
order Wherein the State shall exercise its powers and authority 
through the chosen representatives of the people"
"3. The State shall ensure the elimination of all forms of 
exploitation and the gradual fulfilment of the fundamental principle, 
from  each according to his ability and to each according to his 
work."
"29.(1) The Principles set out in this Chapter shall be known as the 
Principles of Policy, and it is the responsibility of each organ and 
authority of the State, and of each person performing functions on 
behalf of an organ or authority of the State, to act in accordance 
with those Principles insofar as they relate to the functions of the 
organ or authority.
"(2) Insofar as the observance of any particular Principle of Policy 
may be dependent upon resources being available for the purpose, the 
Principle shall be regarded as being subject to the availability of 
resources.
"(3) In respect of each year, the President in relation to the 
affairs of the Federation, and the Governor of each Province in 
relation to the affairs of his Province, shall cause to be prepared 
and laid before the National Assembly or, as the case may be, the 
Provincial Assembly, a report on the observance and implementation of 
the Principles of Policy, and provision shall be made in the rules of 
procedure of the National Assembly or, as the case may be, the 
Provincial Assembly, for discussion on such report. 
"38. The State shall.   
"(a) secure the well-being of the people, irrespective of sex, caste, 
creed or race, by raising their standard of living...;   
"(b) provide for all citizens, within the available resources of the 
country, facilities for work and adequate livelihood with reasonable 
rest and leisure;  
"(c) provide for all persons employed in the service of Pakistan or 
otherwise, social security by compulsory social insurance or other 
means   
"(d) provide basic necessities of life, such as food, clothing, 
housing, education and medical relief, for all such citizens 
irrespective of sex, caste, creed or race, as are permanently or 
temporarily unable to earn their livelihood on account of infirmity, 
sickness or unemployment.
"218.(1) The President, a Governor, the Prime Minister, a Federal 
Minister, a Minister of State, the Chief Minister and a Provincial 
Minister shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise of 
powers and performance of functions of their respective offices or 
for any act done or purported to be done in the exercise of those 
powers and performance of those functions:
"Provided that nothing in this clause shall be construed as 
restricting the right of any person to bring appropriate proceedings 
against the Federation or a Province.
"(2) No criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or 
continued against the President or a Governor in any court during his 
term of office.
"(3) No process for the arrest or imprisonment of the President or a 
Governor shall issue from any court during his term of office."
N.B. The immunity as set out in (2) and (3) above does not extend to 
the Prime Minister, to the Chief Ministers, to their Ministers and 
Advisers, or to the servants of their Governments.

Take this month's visit to the US by our Prime Minister, with her 
substantial retinue and entourage, more correctly referred to as 
ballast or baggage. What were the losses sustained, the gains 
accrued? The intangibles (the loss of remnant repute and respect, the 
earned ridicule) cannot be quantified in terms of money, the 
tangibles can.

The sums I have done are, perforce, rough rounded estimates, ballpark 
figures, since our government as a matter of policy holds in its 
secret sacred trust all truths, so that the people remain totally 
ignorant of what is spent, squandered or stashed away in their name. 
The main heads of expenditure:

1) Advance preparation for PM's visit: Expenses incurred by Cambridge 
Chaudhry Senator Aitzaz Ahsan, former law minister Senator Groovy 
Haider, Adviser Baaji Nahid and their retinue, plus hullagulla 
wallahs necessary to organise cheer-leaders, to buy off the MQM anti-
squads, plus large amounts paid to US lobbyists and PR consultants = 
US$ 5 million
(2) PM's special 'plane, plus backup' plane cost, expenses plus loss 
of earning = US$ 2 million.
(3) Other travelling expenses in Pakistan and in the US; hotel 
expenses at the Waldorf Astoria, New York (why not PIA's Roosevelt?), 
Willard, Washington, and Los Angeles hotels, limousine hire charges; 
stayover/stayback expenses for PM and family (The Dorchester, London) 
friends, hangers-on (reportedly 150/180 went in dribs and drabs) = 
for approx. 10 days, say US$ 1 million.   
(4) Advertisements in the Press: 16-page supplement/ads in Washington 
Post at US$ 63,228 per page, in New York Times at US$ 67,110 per 
page, Los Angeles Times at US$ 61,340 per page, 8 pages of ads in 
Time Magazine plus 'charges' for portraying our Prime Minister on the 
cover of the Time (Asian edition only), and advertisements in other 
US publications = say, US$ 2,250,000   
(5) Fashion/cultural show in Washington and Los Angeles, masterminded 
by the wife of Foreign Secretary Najmuddin Sheikh = US$ 0.5 million.

Say, total debit = US$ 10.75 million x Rs. 31.75 = Rs. 34 crores. 
Columnist Khalid Hasan from Washington estimated a total of US$ 10.5 
million and the editor of Nawa-i-Waqt from Lahore Rs. 35 crores. We 
three and the people of Pakistan would be very happy were the 
government to be able to prove us wrong.

On the credit side: The US has agreed to return to us non-unable 
spare parts, unrepaired, in the same condition in which they were 
sent to them in 1990. The storage charges plus the return freight for 
this 'scrap' will be borne by the people of Pakistan.

The Prime Minister does not deny that she and her family spend our 
money wantonly on "international relations" usually involving 
joyrides for favourites such as Hamid Nasir Chatta, their   brothers-
in-law, mothers-in-law, sons, daughters, nephews, nieces and cousins 
thrice-removed, all of whom are lavishly entertained at our expense 
in hotels around the world, even at Las Vegas and at the various 
international Disneylands. Surely her priorities should rather lie in 
the provisions of Article 38.

She herself disregards what is written by the watchdogs of democracy, 
the men and women of the Press, the Fourth Estate. Her paid hacks, 
when awake, counter some of the criticism levelled but their words 
are devoid of credibility. Such rebuttals inevitably involve what 
they term the greater misdoings of Zia or Nawaz & Co., thereby 
tacitly admitting their own party's misdoings. Those who try to stem 
the rot are considered by her and her supporters as 'vipers' and 
'spiders' to be shunned.

She was removed from office in 1990, on, inter alia, charges of 
corruption. Some 20 references were filed against her and her family 
and friends, but they were never seriosly prosecuted by her 
successors in office (now the opposition), they being more intent 
upon raking in and augmenting their own pile.   

Ours is a poor country, where many die for want of proper nourishment 
and medical care, where the necessities of life such as drinking 
water and electricity are scarce, and where education barely exists. 
We have an abundance of law and a complete lack of order. One can go 
on and on and on listing our woes.

The present opposition is ineffective. They seem only to believe in 
civil disruption, strikes and marches, and in disrupting Assembly 
proceedings by futile walkouts. They are every bit as bad as those in 
government.

The people are helpless. They are taxed and they receive nothing in 
return. The country is broke. Our pensioners and widows do not 
receive their dues. What can be done by the people to stem this waste 
of our trust funds and resources, to ensure that the money is spent 
only for their good as dictated by the priorities enshrined in our 
Constitution.

Culpable the Prime Minister would prima facie seem to be. Can our 
eminent learned lawyers, or even the more sensible among her own 
advisers, not convince her that in law she actually is? Not that this 
would cause her to beat her breast and lament, mea culpa, mea maxima 
culpa",  but it might make her stop and think about mending her ways.

<a name="media"><b>Questionable moves in electronic media sector</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Javed Jabbar

A recent report reveals that permission has been given by the 
"competent authority" in the Federal Government to a particular 
individual/company/group to operate the first-ever nation-wide cable 
TV system and 3 FM radio stations without inviting bids from the 
public. The report underlines the gravity of a situation in which an 
unhealthy media monopoly by the government itself (PTV, STN, PBC) and 
by selected favoured parties (NTM and the new beneficiary) is being 
strengthened and expanded.

It is notable that no denial of the report has been issued so far.

The air waves of Pakistan have been forcibly taken over by a media 
mafia that is using electronic media for political propaganda and for 
personal profiteering.

As if this were not bad enough, the latest reported action by the 
Federal Government violates the Constitution of Pakistan and long-
established principles of public interest.

To give government-controlled corporations, e.g., PTV, STN, PBC, the 
permission to operate TV stations/radio stations may be barely 
tolerable because they are, after all, public sector bodies. But in 
this new case, an entirely private sector entity of the same status 
as any other citizen has been specially singled out for an exclusive 
benefit.

Para 8 of the Preamble of the Constitution (The objectives Resolution 
of 1949) which forms an integral part of the Constitution of Pakistan 
states, in part: "wherein shall be guaranteed fundamental rights 
including equality of status, of opportunity and before law...."

This guarantee is further reinforced in Article 18 which refers to 
"freedom of trade, business or profession" and in Article 25 which 
refers to "the equality of all citizens before law." 

By denying equality of opportunity to interested citizens to make a 
bid to win the right to operate TV and radio stations the federal 
government has deprived them of a basic right guaranteed to them by 
the Constitution.

Whereas citizens are able to apply for permission under the 
Registration of Printing Presses and  Publications Ordinance to 
publish a newspaper or magazine, no equivalent law exists to enable 
citizens to apply for permission to operate TV or radio stations (the 
Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation Act 1973 is specific only for Radio 
Pakistan. PTV and Shalimar Recording Company Ltd [operator of the STN 
channel] are joint stock companies like any other corporation with 
all, or a majority, of their shares owned by government).

The only Article in the Constitution which refers to broadcasting and 
telecasting is Article 159 but this deals only with the relations 
between the federal and the provincial governments with regard to the 
construction and operation of transmitters. Here is a vacuum in the 
law that is distinct and deliberate. This loophole is kept open by 
those vested interests in the establishment and the federal 
government which want to preserve the unjust monopoly by the state 
over TV and radio, and those elements who want to grant permission to 
their own favourites in the private sector by manipulative methods.

The important power to authorise companies or individuals, public or 
private, to operate TV and radio stations is used on a non-
transparent and selective basis purely at the discretion of the 
government.

In the procedural manner of awarding this latest contract, the 
federal government has also violated various rules of business.

The award of a cable TV system and FM radio stations to a particular 
group without advance public notice amounts to blatant discrimination 
against the citizens of Pakistan depriving them of: (a) Freedom of 
speech on TV and radio which is guaranteed to them by Article 19 of 
the Constitution, but which is denied to them because TV and radio, 
specially news and current affairs programmes, are rigidly controlled 
by the Government; and (b) Freedom of opportunity to compete by 
granting licenses and contracts to the favoured private parties to 
operate programme contracts on TV and radio without fair and open 
competition.

In October-December 1994, according to a report, Shalimar Recording 
Company (STN), whose majority shares are controlled by Government of 
Pakistan, in a secret and dubious manner arbitrarily extended the 
monopolistic contract for the STN channel to NTM for an additional 
period of 10 years.

Moreover, this was done by improving the terms in favour of NTM in a 
manner which was not requested by the private party.

A constitutional writ petition filed by 14 leading advertising 
companies challenging the illegal monopolistic contract to NTM is 
still pending in the Sindh High Court for adjudication after being 
admitted for hearing in February in 1993.

The meeting of the Board of Shalimar which extended the contract 
reportedly at the behest of a certain individual was held on an 
irregular basis. Protests by private sector members of the Board 
against this action were ignored; the impropriety of procedure is a 
fit case for investigation by the Corporate Law Authority.

During the tenure of the caretaker government in August-October 1993, 
STN was ordered to publicly invite bids to end the unjust monopoly of 
NTM so that at least 3 contractors could compete and provide 
programmes to STN for separate sets of days in a week. However, 
despite a number of attractive bids being received, the monopoly was 
permitted to continue after the induction of the present Government 
in October 1993. Pressure and threats were reportedly applied to some 
of the bidders to withdraw their bids.

The latest development exposes an unconstitutional and illegal favour 
done by the federal government: it also reveals the latest step in a 
calculated plan to tighten the grip of certain individuals over the 
electronic media sector of the country.

Even the government of the Pakistan Muslim League between 1990 and 
1993 did nothing to correct the unjust monopoly created by STN in 
1990, in the tenure of the second PPP government. This is one 
indicator of how devious methods are being used to influence public 
policy, irrespective of which political party is in office.

Though the concept for a new TV channel system was developed during 
the tenure of this writer as Minister of State for Information and 
Broadcasting between December 1988 and September 1989, the award of 
the monopolistic contract was made in 1990 after this writer ceased 
to be Minister.

In 1995, the situation has deteriorated further.

There is a definite conspiracy in the electronic media sector of our 
country which is detrimental to the national interest of Pakistan: it 
must be fought vigorously by concerned citizens, by newspapers and 
magazines, by media, by Parliament and by legal means.

The federal government should cancel the illegal permission awarded 
for the cable TV system and FM radio stations as well as the 10 year 
extension of the NTM contract. A fully transparent, fair and 
equitable process should be adopted within a new legislative 
framework for TV and radio approved and continuously monitored by 
Parliament.

AT LONG last, religious parties belonging to various schools of 
thought have evolved a code of conduct which, they claim, will bring 
sectarian violence to an end.

The parties, which have formed a national solidarity council, met 
here for two days and discussed all issues threadbare.

Apart from the code of conduct, two other important decisions were 
taken, to observe a complete strike in the country on May 27 to 
protest against the government's plan to amend the blasphemy laws, 
and observe May 26 as a day of solidarity with the Islamic countries, 
especially Iraq, Libya, the Sudan, Iran and the Filipino Muslims who 
are struggling for independence.

This rare show of solidarity by the religious parties is expected to 
lead to sectarian peace in the country and one hopes that the sorry 
practice by one sect calling the other a bunch of apostates will come 
to an end.

<a name="welc"><b>The signals are confusing, but welcome</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD: The opposition is sending confusing signals. Beginning 
with a meeting between Nawaz Sharif and Gen Waheed, it has now come 
to a stage where the PML has launched overt moves to construct a 
conduit to the Presidency. Already they have silenced their guns 
against President Leghari and as an expression of the opposition's 
faith in him, Nawaz has asked the President to intervene and put a 
stop to what he calls the uncalled-for persecution of the opposition 
by the ruling party.

The opposition has also ended its boycott of official functions which 
enabled Senator Chaudhry Shujaat to attend the reception the 
President hosted for formation commanders last week.

Nawaz Sharif's meetings with the visiting heads of state and 
government have started being shown in the main news bulletins on the 
PTV. Senator Shujaat's cousin, Pervaiz Elahi, acting leader of the 
opposition in the Punjab Assembly, has already been released on bail. 
Nawaz's brother Abbas Sharif, MNA, and his nephew Hamza Sharif 
(Shahbaz's son) held on charges of financial irregularities, are 
likely to be released on bail soon.

Also it now transpires that the PML is having second thoughts about 
its decision to withdraw from House committees. The possibility of 
their early return to these committees cannot be ruled out in the 
House itself, the exchanges during the just concluded session had 
remained more or less civilised, barring a few incidents here and 
there, mostly provoked by dimwits on the two sides.

The other day I asked the secretary-general of the PML, Sartaj Aziz, 
for his comments on these developments. Instead of giving a direct 
reply, the Senator made a short but profound observation on what he 
termed" Western" democracy. This system, according to him, makes it 
impossible for the government and the opposition to have anything but 
a confrontational relationship. Any seeming concord between the two 
on anything, he maintained, would be regarded as a sell- out and "we 
would be labelled as loyal opposition."

When I pressed further asking him if, as a consequence of these new 
developments, he expected the government to accede to the ruling of 
the speaker and bring the incarcerated members of the PML to the 
House, he said: "If they do that, then we would be in a better 
position to table a no-confidence motion against the government." But 
he hastened to add that the opposition would go for the kill only if 
it had a relatively bigger margin than one or two votes.

Another interesting observation which he made during this 
conversation was that the opposition has now switched its politics 
>from  the streets to the drawing-rooms. He did not elaborate.

Sartaj Aziz's mention of noconfidence motion brought to my mind a 
conversation I had some weeks back with a young PPP MNA from the 
South. The topic was Rule 90. He gave me the impression that the 
government had been under great stress from within at the time when 
it started hitting back at the opposition with cases and arrests in 
the name of accountability.

The pressure mounted on the government by the opposition from the 
streets during the train march, according to this MNA, had given a 
handle in the hands of the avaricious on the treasury benches and 
they had started making unreasonable demands on the leadership 
thinking that since the Prime Minister was facing an impending no-
confidence motion, she would readily grant them their lucrative 
wishes. It was at about this time, the MNA from South said, that the 
PM decided to hit her way out of the corner. And the opposition just 
happened to be in the firing line. This PPP MNA has a very poor 
opinion of the interior ministry and thought that the FIA was too 
ill-equipped professionally, as well as morally, to investigate 
economic crimes.

While it is trying to establish seemingly normal links with the 
Presidency and the GHQ, the opposition appears otherwise determined 
to keep targeting at the ruling party's weakest spot, its wafer-thin 
margin in the House. Another one of the ruling party's weaker spots 
is its perceived queasy relationship with the army. And the 
opposition has tried to push a wedge into every real and imaginary 
crevice in this relationship whenever an opportunity came its way or 
it could contrive one. So far it has not succeeded in its aims. But 
it is not likely to give up trying. Last week Chaudhry Nisat tried it 
again by talking fast and loose in the Press gallery of the National 
Assembly. I remember once PML MNA Ahsan Iqbal telling me at the peak 
of the opposition's train march that the army and his party were 
natural allies. The implications were too obvious, and ominous too.

The chances are the opposition will continue to use every opportunity 
to bring the government down, which is their legitimate right. And 
the government, on the other hand, would use every trick in its bag 
to ward off the slings of the opposition as best it could and try to 
complete its term which, rumours have it, is likely to be reduced by 
one year by the government on its own.

Meanwhile, there is nothing wrong if the PML develops a proper 
relationship with the other two members of the troika, the President 
and the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS),both of whom by the very 
nature of their offices have to be politically neutral. The 
President, especially, has a role to play in keeping the two sides 
from  committing excesses.

Establishment of open lines between the opposition and the Presidency 
and between the opposition and the COAS would serve also to eliminate 
useless misunderstandings and wasteful debates on non-issues.

An unhindered line to the GHQ would in addition serve to curb the 
temptation to take liberties with security issues and related matters 
like who should be promoted and who should not; who should be given a 
two- year extension and who should be sent home immediately; and how 
early should one announce the name of a retiring chief's successor.

<a name="nbom"><b>Carneige endowment report : India can make 80 N-bombs, Pakistan 25</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, April 28: Pakistan has the capability to produce as 
many as 25 nuclear devices within hours or days while India can 
assemble 80 nuclear devices within the same period. The apparent 
ability of both South Asian states to deploy short-range nuclear-
capable ballistic missiles threatens to trigger an escalating arms 
race between them, says a Carnegie Endowment study.

The study which was unveiled on Thursday at a Press conference at the 
United Nations in the backdrop of the 178-nation nuclear Non-
Proliferation Treaty's extension debate, says: "Pakistan's nuclear 
weapons are thought to have yields comparable to the device used by 
the United States on Nagasaki."

The study, called "Tracking nuclear proliferation, a guide in maps 
and charts-1995," says that, according to conservative estimates of 
India's nuclear weapons programme potential published in India in 
1992, it had that time enough plutonium to make 60 nuclear warheads 
and, in 1995, it was projected to have enough plutonium to produce as 
many as 80.

India, the study says, is also working on two nuclear-capable 
missiles, the short-range Prithvi, intended for use against Pakistan, 
and intermediate-range Agni, apparently intended for use against 
China.

Quoting the State Department study made in April of 1994, which was 
submitted to US Congress, it was projected that Pakistan could 
assemble "a limited number of nuclear weapons in relatively short 
timeframe." A portion of Pakistan's potential arsenal apparently 
consists of a number of complete but unassembled nuclear weapons, 
which could be readied for use in hours the study says.

The remainder of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal, the Carnegie study says, 
consists of weapons-grade nuclear material, that together could be 
fashioned into weapons in weeks or possible days. In all, Pakistan 
might be able to deploy between 15 and 25 nuclear weapons.

The Carnegie study says Pakistan, which is not a party to the 
Nonproliferation Treaty, secretly launched its nuclear programme in 
1972, in the aftermath of its defeat in the 1971 war with India. The 
programme, which accelerated dramatically after India's nuclear test 
in May 1974, made substantial progress by the early 1980s. A 1983 US 
State Department analysis of Pakistan's nuclear-weapons effort 
declared that there was "unambiguous evidence that Pakistan is 
actively pursuing a weapons development programme." The report 
highlighted Pakistan's progress in key areas of weapons manufacture, 
its critical dependence on clandestine efforts to procure nuclear 
equipment from private Western firms, and nuclear assistance from 
China, including assistance "in the area of fissile material 
production and possibly also nuclear device design." The centre piece 
of the programme is Pakistan's Kahuta enrichment plant, which is not 
subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, says 
the study.

The Carnegie study says that however, Pakistan's ability to produce 
weapons-usable nuclear materials will be further enhanced upon 
completion of a plutonium production reactor now under construction 
at Khushab. The reactor, which is being built with Chinese 
assistance, according to US officials, is not subject to IAEA 
inspection and, when completed, will provide Pakistan with its first 
source of unsafeguarded plutonium-bearing spent fuel. If plutonium 
>from  that fuel is extracted at the nearby Chashma reprocessing plant 
or at the pilot-scale plant at Rawalpindi, both of which are thought 
to be ready to operate, but neither of which is currently subjected 
to IAEA inspection, Pakistan could obtain plutonium that it would be 
legally free to use for nuclear arms.

(China is also supplying to Pakistan a nulcear power plant, which is 
under construction at Chashma, which will be placed under IAEA.

DELIVERY CAPABILITY: As regards Pakistan's ability to deliver the 
nuclear devices in case of a war, the study says it possesses a 
variety of nuclear-capable fighter-bomber aircraft, including the US-
supplied F-16s, that could be modified to deliver nuclear weapons in 
a crisis. There is also a growing evidence that Pakistan has received 
nulcear-capable, 280-km range M-11 missiles from China, or key 
components for the system. It had not deployed this system as of 
early 1995, but apparently could take this step relatively quickly.

In August 1993, the study says, the United States imposed sanctions 
on Pakistan and China. The sanctions against the latter were lifted 
in October 1994, after China agreed to a ban on the sale of missiles 
inherently capable of carrying a 500-kg payload to a distance of 300 
km or more, a ban which China agreed prohibited further exports of 
the M-11. In the mid-1980s also, with Chinese assistance, Pakistan 
launched a programme to develop two short-range nuclear-capable 
ballistic missiles, the Hatf-I and Hatf-II, with ranges of 80 km and 
300 km respectively. US intelligence sources believe that the Hatf-I 
has probably already been deployed but that the Hatf-II will not be 
available for a number of years, the study adds.

<a name="move"><b>An intelligent opposition move</b></a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD: Opposition Pakistan Muslim League in all fairness deserves 
credit for its timely move to disapprove, through a resolution, the 
recently-promulgated Presidential ordinance empowering the special 
courts to accept the confession of an accused given before a police 
officer as evidence.

The treasury benches were caught off guard when the Speaker told them 
that the disapproval motion was received by his secretariat a 
fortnight hack.

When Deputy Law Minister Raza Rabbani tabled a heap of ordinances 
before the House, the acting deputy opposition leader, Hamza, opposed 
the laying of the first ordinance relating to the special courts.

The silver-tongued Raza Rabbani took refuge behind the rules saying 
that at least three days' notice was required for moving a 
disapproval motion and that it was purely the Speaker's discretion to 
allow it Or not. But he must have received a shock of his short 
parliamentary life when the Speaker told him that the motion was 
received in his secretariat at least 12 days back.

This is also a hint that the government was not enjoying the 
Speaker's confidence, otherwise the ruling party is normally informed 
about such resolutions by the Assembly secretariat.

Though the opposition was less effective without Iftikhar Gilani at 
such a crucial time, Yaseen Wattoo pleaded the opposition case in 
spite of Hamza's presence, who is good at spoiling even a strong 
argument.

Since this was for the first time in Pakistan's parliamentary history 
that such a motion had been moved, the Speaker patiently heard the 
two sides hefore giving his decision." I use my discretion in favour 
of the opposition," Gilani said allowing the disapproval motion which 
would now be discussed and voted upon during the next session.

The ruling party would hopefully also seriously take the advice of 
the Speaker that the controversial ordinance should be bulldozed.

But bills have been bulldozed by the ruling parties in the past with 
the connivance of the Speaker. The 12th Amendment would not have been 
passed in 20 minutes had the then speaker, Gohar Ayub, who is now 
championing the cause of democracy, not colluded with the ruling 
party.

Gohar failed in the test when it was time to prove his democratic 
credentials and now it's Yousaf Raza Gilani's turn. Hopefully history 
will not repeat itself.

The opposition fear that the ordinance has all the ingredients for 
being used as a whip against it is not totally unfounded. The police 
are known for getting confessions through third-degree methods and 
all the pitfalls must be studied before the government decides to 
pass this bill. It might have its own reasons to bring this law but 
it must listen to the opposition's voice instead of making it an 
issue of its ego.

Since this was the last sitting of the present session, the 
opposition and ruling party members were trying to settle the scores 
by generously passing remarks and taunting each other.

Witty Ghazanfar Gul, whose remarks are mostly ignored by the Speaker, 
was at his best today. He did not leave any opportunity to target 
Hamza. When an opposition member pointed out the lack of quorum in 
the House after most of the opposition members had left the hall, 
Ghazanfar was quick in saying that Hamza has such a repulsive 
personality that even opposition members have run away from him after 
he was imposed on them as their deputy opposition leader.

When the Speaker asked Hamza to brief him on the rules for presenting 
a disapproval motion, it was Ghazanfar again who said: "Mr Speaker, 
he doesn't know the rules himself, how can he brief you."

The move by the opposition members to create a quorum problem did not 
meet with success. After the passage of an opposition resolution, 
which had caused embarrassment for the government, the ruling party 
members can ill-afford to leave the House.

PPP's chief whip Khursheed Shah has a tough job to ensure the 
presence of his party members and though being a minister he prefers 
to sit on the back benches to keep vigilance.

Even Petroleum Minister Saifullah Khan had to mortgage his file to 
guarantee his return. While Saifullah was about to leave the hall, 
Khursheed Shah rushed to him and asked him to leave his file with him 
to ensure his return.

Opposition member Ahsan Iqbal, who had a major role in creating a 
pandemonium in the House on Wednesday, was cautioned by the Speaker 
not to use provocative language. Every time he would stand up to 
speak on some issue, the Speaker would ask him to refrain from using 
provocative language.

The privilege motions moved by the MNAs have become a laughing- 
stock. We have seen breach of privilege motions being moved by the 
members where someone's driver was not allowed to take a weapon 
inside the airport car-park, or where the plane was delayed for bad 
weather or where someone's relatives were not given a VVIP treatment.

A similar case was brought up by opposition member Amjad Yaseen who 
was annoyed over why the PLA failed to provide him a seat on his open 
ticket. And it was painful to see that he moved the motion knowing 
well that three other ruling party members who had open tickets were 
also not accommodated in the same plane.

Demanding seat on an open ticket is not a privilege of a member 
whether it a national airline or a private airline. What should have 
the airline done, thrown out one of the passengers who had a reserved 
seat. Those who have elected them and sent them to the assemblies 
must be given more respect and it is time that the parliamentarians 
stop being frivolous about their privileges.

It appears they need more careful handling than even the glassware. 
Let them put on sticker on their foreheads reading: "Parliamentarians 
handle with care."

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  A Majid Khan

PESHAWAR, May 3: Top Seed Jansher Khan, world champion for the first 
time conceded 11 points against Zubair Jahan Khan who came close to 
taking a game before the former moved into the semifinals of the 
Sixth PSF Federation Cup here this afternoon.

Jansher Khan whose quarter final was played at the PAF Squash 
Complex, had to stay on the court for 33 minutes before recording a 
9-0, 9-3, 10-8 win. In his earlier two matches superfit Jansher Khan 
did not drop a single point in his ruthless eliminations of his 
rivals.

Jansher-Zubair match: Playing with supreme confidence Jansher started 
the game in a commanding way pocketing the first game at 9-0 in just 
five minutes as hard hitting Zubair Jehan Khan committed many 
unforced mistakes. Zubair's drives time and again hit the 19-inch tin 
of the PAF Squash Complex as he had played his earlier two encounters 
on courts with 17inch tins.

However, Zubair Jahan, former runner-up of the Asian Championship 
here, took some time to get used to the 19-inch tin. He improved his 
play in the second game against Jansher who after leading 2-0 trailed 
2-3 as Zubair hit two forehand winners. Great Jansher was back in the 
game in a punishing mood and produced a brace of winners. He took 
seven points in one hand with Zubair invariably hitting the tin (9-
3).
