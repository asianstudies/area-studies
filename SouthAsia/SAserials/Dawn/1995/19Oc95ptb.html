Ardeshir Cowasjee
THOUGH relatively less proficient in scam-rigging, the members of the 
loyal opposition in our honourable National Assembly sniffed out a 
scam the proposed New City to be built east of Islamabad on the 
right bank of the River Soan.
They asked questions in the House and succeeded in forcing the 
 Higher- Ups (HUs) of our government to hand around a sheet of paper 
giving facts on the project, aptly headed We believe in 
transparency. The transparency was immediately suspect.
 The project is being undertaken by large well-reputed multinationals 
on a turn-key basis... is one stated fact.
The well-reputed multinationals listed are MG Hertz (Pvt) Ltd and MG 
Realtors (Pvt) Ltd, both registered in Pakistan, with an authorised 
capital of Rs 100 million each, and SYNTEX International which is 
registered in Singapore and also has an office in London.
 The contract stipulates that the land has already been acquired... 50 
per cent of Islamabad New City has been earmarked for the lower income 
group, 30 per cent is for those who fall in the middle income group, 
and only 20 per cent will be for those who have a large income. 
 All financial and regulatory control lies with the CDA and NHA... No 
institution in Pakistan has made any investment by force or otherwise 
in Islamabad New City... It took over 30 months of negotiation to 
finalise the joint-venture company. No short-cuts were adopted. 
The joint-venture company has not been named. Details of MG (Morris 
Garage?) Hertz (Car Rentals?) or the other MG are not available. 
Obtaining details of companies registered in well governed countries 
is not difficult.
SYNTEX International was registered in Singapore as a Limited Exempt 
Private Company on August 6, 1994, (14 months ago). The registered 
office address is 74 Janan Benaan Kapal, Singapore 399653. The 
principal activity of the company is declared to be Consultant 
Engineering Services . The authorised capital is one million Singapore 
dollars, the issued ordinary capital is two Singapore dollars (yes, 
two) and the paid-up ordinary capital is also two Singapore dollars 
(two again). The only two shareholders of the company are the 
directors, each being the proud possessor of a one-dollar share. These 
lucky gentlemen are Patrick Anthoy Finn, British passport holder (No.L 
004329), of The Old Hall, Battersby, Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, 
England, and Yap Lim Chong Jimmy, Singapore passport holder 
(S11112054591), of 139 Lorong Ah Soo, #08-193, Singapore 1953.
No AGM has been held. The names of the auditors and bankers are not 
available. The London office address is not known. No bank in 
Singapore or England is in a position to give any reference concerning 
this paper company or its directors.
The front page of Dawn on October 10 carried an advertisement inserted 
through The Agency by the National Housing Authority, Islamabad, and 
the Authorised Sales Agent Syed Mohammed Idrees, Modern Shelter 
International, 3 Kamran Apartments, 79 Ferozepur Road, Lahore , who 
has a Karachi office, telephone numbers 5890731, 540561, 5888278. 
These telephones are located in a one-room estate agency, Syed 
International, in the Defence Society, which doubles as an Agfa film 
pick-up point.
A very polite gentleman at Syed International, in exchange for Rs 150, 
gave me a brochure and a plot application form to be filed with the 
first instalment by October 15. The master plan has not yet been 
prepared. He did not know whether the advertised 10,000 acres of land 
had been acquired or not, or how many plots were to be carved out for 
the people, the sitting ducks.
The brochure bears the crests of the GOP, CDA, and NHA, and apart from 
the usual bumph, and the sentence A reasonable space is left aside 
for a graveyard , tells you the discounted pre- ballot prices of the 
plots 
250 sq yds Rs 330,000 500, Rs 660,000 1,000, Rs 2,400,000 2500, Rs 
3,000,000 and 3000, Rs 3,600,000. 25 per cent is to be paid to the 
NHA with the application 25 on or before one year from the date of 
application 15 on or before 18 months, and 10 on delivery of 
possession (when?).
The form requires the applicant to sign various undertakings as to how 
and where one pays, and what extras one will have to pay if one does 
not pay in time, but nowhere does it tell one how, when and what will 
be refunded by whom, if for any reason, good or bad, the project does 
not take off or deliver. Jim and Pat of SYNTEX, if found, will only be 
able to dole out to the sitting ducks the lordly sum of two Singapore 
dollars.
During the time I was at the estate agency the telephone did not stop 
ringing, and there was a steady stream of people, obviously retired 
officers of the government and the armed forces, none of whom looked 
at all flush with money, but who had faith in what the NHA and the CDA 
were selling them.
Could this be another grand scam perpetrated by our HUs? We cannot 
prevent the government from advertising on their television channel. 
But should our newspaper editors not have the project examined, the 
shortcomings and loopholes assessed, lead the people, and then decide 
whether to carry the advertisements? This duty, every responsible 
newspaper owes to its readers.
I vividly recall the full-page advertisements of the many Samad Scams, 
enticing sitting ducks to invest , and later reading the woes of the 
thousands of poor people who lost their life s savings. Sermonising 
editorials printed, after all is over, provide no succour. This must 
not happen again.
The solvency and the viability of the CDA and the NHA, both headed by 
recently appointed favourites, is not greater than that of the 
monstrous ever-looted, ever-losing KDA operating under the direct 
control of provincial minister Pir Mazarul Haque who is encouraged by 
Chief Minister Abdullah Shah who in turn blindly obeys our HUs. How 
could the KDA possibly remain solvent? It is BROKE. It cannot meet its 
liabilities. Salaries for the month of August were paid to the lower 
staff on September 11, and to officers on September 20. So far, no one 
has been paid for September.
Take the KDA commercial complex on the Sharea Faisal (opposite the 
turning to Fatima Jinnah Road), built with its funds with the express 
purpose of generating income for the Authority. Before any areas could 
be let out, the Government of Sindh (GOS), also BROKE, stepped in and 
ordered the KDA to sell the complex to the EOBI (Employees Old-age 
Benefit Institution, the government- managed peoples pension fund) at 
the arbitrarily fixed price of Rs 200 million (20 crores). In May 
1994, the EOBI paid Rs 100 million to the KDA without taking 
possession of the complex, and the GOS immediately had this sum 
transferred to its own coffers.
Then, some time during the second half of 1994, whilst the EOBI was 
still clamouring for possession of the complex,in stepped Grand 
Mandarin Salman Faruqui, provider of the needs, fulfiller of the 
desires, of all our HUs. He took over the complex for his much-
publicised Civic Centre Company (CCC), formed with capital extorted 
>from  the utility companies (Sui Gas, KESC, WAPDA, PTC, etc). The 
complex is to house a centre to which the harried people of Greater 
Karachi will have to travel, twice or thrice a month, from as far way 
as outer Orangi, to pay their utility bills. The centre has yet to be 
opened with the usual razzmatazz, our chief stone-layer tape-cutter 
being far too occupied to find time.
The KDA has assessed the worth of its complex at Rs 250 million and is 
now seeking Faruqui s help to get this money. Faruqui is being 
difficult because the KDA is not waiving its NUF (non-utilisation 
fees) amounting to Rs 28 lakhs, which landlord Faruqui owes in respect 
of his plot (F-16, Block 5, Kekhashan 5, opposite the Boat Basin) 
acquired, along with other plots, when he was provincial secretary of 
housing and town planning in the Nizami era.
The frightened DG, KDA, cannot justify the waiver and has lobbed the 
ball onto the court of the governing body of the KDA chaired by 
Commissioner of Karachi Zia-ul-Islam, where it now lies.
The KDA is left to claim its Rs 250 million from whoever . The EOBI 
is reclaiming from whoever , what it has paid, plus interest a 
total of Rs 127 million of the people s money of which it was 
deprived. The whoever is not concerned. There is no government.
The shenanigans do not end here. The KDA had reserved the 10,000 sq yd 
commercial plot adjacent to the complex as a parking lot. They say 
they were pressured by Hakim Ali to sell it to a friend for Rs 25 
million, the market price then being 250 million. Honest Hakim, 
affectionately known as Honhak , could never have done it. After all, 
was he not the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee in BB s first 
Assembly? Now the CCC is after the parking lot, which the friendly 
possessor, Summer Resorts, may sell at the market price of Rs 350 
million!
Sitting ducks?

<a name="dark">Dark forebodings about the future</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M.B. Naqvi
SEVEN former bureaucrats have written a letter to the Prime Minister 
expressing concern over the state of governance. They are disheartened 
by the drift of events, remarks by foreign area specialists and the 
assessment of prominent Pakistanis to the effect that the Pakistan 
state might soon collapse by the turn of the century.
The issues they have taken up concern mainly the economic consequence 
of leaving the various problems unresolved. The slide towards 
lawlessness throughout the country and high inflation rates ought to 
receive the most urgent attention. The seven former bureaucrats have 
in fact indicated approaches to be employed and have contented 
themselves with urging the government to bestir itself and do 
something purposeful and positive. One of their substantive 
recommendations is the establishment of a commission to enquire and 
suggest remedies rather than directly suggesting them. Another point 
they make is that if the government can register progress in certain 
key areas it would make a sea change in the climate of opinion and 
expectations and things will start looking up.
A specific recommendation has been made by the two former foreign 
ministers, two former Air Chiefs, an interior secretary and a former 
ambassador deserve special attention. It concerns Karachi. They say a 
solution in this respect can no longer be separated from such 
questions as holding local bodies elections, reviewing criminal cases 
and removal of known grievances. It is in fact a positive and 
substantive suggestion. Although it cannot be confused with an 
endorsement of the basic MQM line, the elements of the solution 
indicated here are in fact a dictate of common-sense.
Indeed if the problems of Karachi and Sindh do not get resolved, it 
would be another Greek tragedy. Why? because the government has been 
urged to be serious about negotiations and recognise the basic nature 
of Karachi problem. It arises from not recognising the representative 
character of the MQM and refusal to give it a share in the running of 
the local government in the areas that it so convincingly controls. 
Its right to manage the local government is legitimate.
There is no moral or political obligation on the PPP to offer a direct 
power-sharing in the government. That may be PPP s need or requirement 
but it is not a right that the MQM can claim. But what the MQM can 
demand and should get is a dominant say in the affairs of local 
government (with some amplification of functions and authority) in 
places where they represent the urban population. Which is a fully-
fledged resolution of at least Karachi and Hyderabad problems that the 
government has only to recognise.
While there is much that has created pessimism among the aware 
citizenry, it is premature. There is also time to correct one s 
mistakes, especially, the approach the PPP government has adopted to 
the numerous and monumental problems facing the nation. The wholesale 
loss of morale and widespread pessimism regarding the future of 
Pakistan can itself work as a factor accelerating the movement in an 
unending downhill process. We have to get a hold over ourselves if we 
want to ensure a better future.
In terms of public perception, the widespread corruption should be 
accorded highest priority after Karachi and Sindh. Human rights are 
being violated throughout the country wholesale, though far more so in 
Sindh and Karachi. These are systemic failures. Let us not forget the 
old and familiar problems like high unemployment, technological 
backwardness, insufficient and inefficient infrastructure and balance 
of payments difficulties on the economic side.
The longer-term internal security situation should also be considered 
a systemic problem alongwith the lawlessness. It had led to Pakistan s 
dismemberment in the past and remains to be resolved. There is also 
the ideological problem the religious extremists are for ever 
demanding more Islamisation of an Islamic Pakistan.
The resolution of Karachi problem has already been indicated by these 
seven. But what about other issues like the foreign policy questions 
bearing on Afghanistan, Kashmir, India, relations with the US and the 
isolation of Pakistan, not to mention the frustrations on several 
other counts. It will be unwise to ignore the clutch of economic 
problems. The main point to be registered is that should the systemic 
problems be honestly tackled with determination, the grounds for 
hoping for a turn- around in the estimations and expectations of 
locals and foreigners would be possible. The evidence of an honest 
effort can work like magic in changing the climate of opinion about 
Pakistan s future. As a rule, this writer has no time for the opinion 
of foreign experts. The point is that if we do what is right, the 
opinion of foreigners will look after itself. Let us concern ourselves 
what is the right thing to do.
This simply means more democracy. It also means, and certainly 
involves rule of law that involves free judiciary through defanging 
the government. A system that actually allows fundamental rights of 
the citizens including the right to economic security (gainful 
employment), a measure of education and healthcare through rule of 
law the substance of good governance would have been achieved.

<a name="pric">Prices the reality is far more disturbing</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin
AN OUTDATED base and an irrelevant basket have rendered the official 
inflation estimates largely meaningless, consequently depicting a 
current price picture much less harsher than it really is.
According to an official document pleading for revision of the base of 
the Consumer Price Index, a CPI can be treated as the most reliable 
indicator of the price movements over time only when it represents 
base as closely as possible .
It has been over 15 years since the present base was fixed in 1980-81. 
Which makes the official inflation estimates totally unreliable.
According to an official study the base of the CPI reflects the income 
and consumption patterns of consumers at any fixed point of time. The 
CPI with an older base period may not be adequately representative of 
present day patterns of household expenditure in many fields of 
consumption due to following factors 
1. Industrial development introduces new items of consumption which 
causes changes in the pattern of household expenditure.
2. Economic changes also have an impact upon the availability of 
commodities and purchasing power, which affect consumers behaviour to 
their spendings and savings.
3. Changes in buying pattern of the consumers.
4. Coverage of index is extended to new geographical areas. The 
Federal Bureau of statistics has been compiling and publishing 
regularly on monthly basis successively the CPI series with 1980-81 as 
base years for three categories of employees i.e. industrial 
commercial, and government and four income groups for 12 major urban 
centres namely Gujranwalal, Hyderabad, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, 
Faisalabad, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, Rawalpindi, Sialkot and Sukkur. 
>From July 1987, the coverage of CPI with 1980-81 as base was increased 
>from  12 to 25 cities. The additional cities covered were Bahawalpur, 
Gujrat, Jhang, Muzafargarh, Rahim Yar Khan, Sahiwal, Sargodha, 
Larkana, Mirpur Khas, Nawabshah, Abbottabad, Bannu and Mardan selected 
through sampling method.
The Economic Coordination Committee of the cabinet (ECC) in its 
meetings held on 23.2.88 and 15.3.1988 constituted a committee under 
the chairmanship of AGN Kazi, the then deputy Chairman of the Planning 
Commission to review the methodology of price indices and make 
recommendations for other reform to make them more representative and 
meaningful. The ECC in its meeting held on 9.8.1988 approved the 
report of the Committee.
But it is October 1995 and there is still no sign that the government 
has made up its mind to face the facts of life and release the rate of 
inflation estimated on the basis of 1990-91 base. However, by delaying 
the inevitable, it is only compounding the country s economic ills and 
making it impossible for the housewife to protect the family from the 
vagaries of the prices and allow the entrepreneur to take sound 
investment decisions.

<a name="alun">A lunch with the Sharifs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
OPPOSITION Leader Nawaz Sharif and the rest of the Sharif family are 
caught in what a typical American would call, a helluva big, big 
B.S. (B.S. meaning the repelling remains of a bull s food) they 
are being treated by Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari with huge doses 
of their own medicine, reading from the prescriptions they wrote while 
governing Pakistan from 1990 to 1993.
This impression is inescapable after meeting Mr. Nawaz Sharif, and his 
family. The Sharifs are in a spin, or so it appeared. Benazir Bhutto, 
they said, had ruined their business and industry to the point that 
they were close to bankruptcy. They think she has handed over the 
government and specially the financial controls of the country to 
husband Zardari, who is so blatant in his enthusiasm to overdo things 
that even the Sharifs are astonished.
Politically, they say, the squeeze is tight. The Bhuttos have got all 
the money in the world to buy votes in the assemblies and so it is 
almost impossible to outbid them for an in-house change. Mr. Zardari 
is the richest man in Pakistan, NS claims.
Corruption, they say, is at its peak and Shahbaz Sharif thinks all 
limits have been crossed. Interestingly, they point out, the Benazir 
Government with its own President, a handpicked judiciary and total 
control of all levers of power has not been able to bring even one 
case of financial corruption against them.
 No one has accused me of corruption in the Lahore-Islamabad Motorway 
or Privatisation, Nawaz Sharif says. They have 150 cases against me 
and my political allies but I don t mind these cases. But think of 
what kind of cases they would face, he remarks.
The conversation soon turns to Karachi and in view of their meetings 
with MQM s Altaf Hussain in London, I ask them what they think would 
happen. Altaf Hussain is being pushed to the wall. What options have 
you given him, Nawaz Sharif asks. And he says if Karachi remains 
crippled, the entire country would collapse, given the present 
situation of the economy and over-inflated claims of foreign 
investment.
Both the brothers are keen to know what the Americans feel about them 
and why the State Department so promptly issue a statement condemning 
the treason case instituted by the Benazir Government against Nawaz 
Sharif. They were genuinely surprised when I told them that someone in 
the State Department called me to inform me that the State Department 
had a statement ready on the treason case, if that question was asked 
at the regular briefing by the spokesman Nick Burns. I did ask the 
question and the response was there, in writing and in detail.
Why did the State Department persist later after the Benazir 
Government protested against the response, the Sharifs were eager to 
know. They had no idea that once a position was taken by the State 
Department on any issue, and that is done after due deliberations and 
consideration, it always stood by that position, no matter what the 
reactions.
They appeared satisfied that the State Department had, in its fact 
sheet on Pakistan issued in March 95, praised the Nawaz Sharif 
Government for its economic policies. We understand, they say, that 
the U.S. would be willing to deal with any elected government although 
at the moment it appears the Clinton Administration is showing a 
marked tilt towards Benazir Bhutto.
How do you see the political situation, they would ask me repeatedly. 
I told them that my tentative conclusion was that Benazir Bhutto was 
no longer interested in a third term and she might leave the country 
for an international job once the present term expired.
He then gives out his thoughts about what changes are needed to ensure 
that Pakistan survives all the corruption, mismanagement and political 
wheeling dealing. A major constitutional reform package is needed in 
which there should be one all powerful chief executive and not three 
centres of power that we have today - the President, the Prime 
Minister and the Army Chief. 
Shahbaz Sharif says he would favour a system more like the American or 
the French types with a directly elected President because then he 
would be able to perform without being blackmailed by 300 legislators.
The two have yet to translate these thoughts into concrete proposals 
which could be publicly debated but they think these changes should be 
made through the present democratic process and not through a decree 
of an unauthorised usurper of power.
Ninety minutes of discussions on all these subjects with the Sharif 
brothers leave me with the thought that they are determined to come 
back, they have not been intimidated by the strong-arm tactics started 
by late Governor Choudhry Altaf Hussain and pursued thoughtlessly by 
Benazir Bhutto, they are confident of their political support and 
believe in their comeback, sooner or later.

<a name="what">What's the truth about this 'ambush' episode?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
EVEN the gullible and the taken in would not take kindly to ache' 
explanation offered by the government for 'the deaths of Fahim Faruqi 
alias Commando and three other MQM activists while in police custody. 
There is nothing unusual about fake encounters in this part of the 
world. But the audacity marking this latest action is breathtaking, to 
say the least. Faheem and the three prisoners, say the authorities, 
died in an ambush while being taken from prison to a spot where they 
were supposed to identify an arms cache. If it was an ambush that 
'they ran into, how come that they were the only ones to have been 
riddled with bullets, while the policemen with them escaped with 'not 
a scratch on their bodies? As explanations go, this is about the 
thinnest that has come the way of the public for a long time. 
Were these killings carried out in revenge for the rocket attacks on 
the Sindh Secretariat? Given their timing (a' day after the sacrilege 
committed against the inner sanctum of the Sindh government) and the 
brazenness distinguishing them, it is not easy to shrug off this 
suspicion. If this is indeed the case, then nothing could be more 
tragic because it marks another important step in Karachi's descent 
into the law of the jungle. Is this what the authorities are trying to 
establish in Karachi? And are they not aware of the consequences of 
their actions? Already there are serious charges against 'them of 
resorting to the most 
arbitrary methods in their fight against violence in the city. This 
incident provides damning evidence of an approach which is doing so 
much to nurture feelings of ill-will and even hatred against the 
government, and all that it is seen to stand for, amongst the Mohajir 
population of Karachi. Mr Altaf Hussain does'not need to do anything 
to consolidate or expand his constituency. The government with its 
highhanded tactics and 
thoughtless ways is doing the job splendidly well for him. 
Needless to say, a government has a duty to crack down an lawlessness 
But it should be equally plain even to the meanest intelligence that 
when the government itself is seen to take the law into its hands it 
not only loses its moral authority it also encourages the already 
disaffected to take the law into their hands. This is precisely what 
we are seeing in Karachi with the arbitrariness of law enforcement 
adding grist to the mills of resentment and violence. If this is the 
government's preferred method for winning the battle for hearts and 
minds in Karachi, all we can say is that the sooner it turns its back 
upon it the better for the country. 
It is all too easy to read lectures to the MQM about the virtues of 
moderation. But, in all fairness, if with every passing day- more and 
more of its ' activists find themselves sacrificed at the altar of 
extra-judicial justice what is it to do except make its feelings felt 
through such actions as calls for strikes? Clearly, we cannot live 
with this situation for too long. General Babar's approach to the 
pacification of Karachi is being threatened by bankruptcy because 
after its few initial successes it now seems to be doing more harm 
than 
good. Even if the government persists in doing what it has been doing, 
it should not forget the fact that events often dictate their own 
logic. To cite a telling instance, the army was inspired by high hopes 
when it 
set out to cleanse Karachi of violence in 1992. A little over two 
years later it had to conduct an orderly retreat. The way things are 
going in Karachi this government too may have to bow before the 
pressure of 
circumstances but not before causing more damage to the psyche and 
fabric of Karachi. Meanwhile, it would help 'if a proper and impartial 
judicial inquiry-and not the magisterial one that has been ordered-was 
conducted into the deaths of Faheem and his colleagues and appropriate 
action taken in the light of the' truth so ascertained. A cover-up of 
this incident would send the wrong message to the people of Karachi.

<a name="newa">New anti-corruption tools</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed
THE government has not taken seriously the listing of Pakistan as the 
third most corrupt country in the world after Indonesia and China 
by Transparency International as it is a new organisation and does not 
insist on publicising its findings.
But the people have taken it seriously and consider it a confirmation 
of the sorry state of affairs in Pakistan.
The federal cabinet, which discussed corruption and abuse of power by 
higher bureaucracy on September 18, was told that a commission would 
be set up soon to scrutinise the assets of officers in grade 20 and 
above. The cabinet had noted that since government servants were 
required to submit declarations of assets annually, there was no need 
to investigate the hidden assets. The new commission, yet to be 
constituted, is to determine the extent of hidden assets in each case.
The Chief Election Commissioner last month reminded members of the 
Senate, national and provincial Assemblies to file their statements of 
assets and liabilities with the Election Commission by September 30. 
Last year the law-makers did not comply with the legal requirement. 
How many of them have completed those formalities now remains to be 
seen.
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is reported to have sent for details of 
31 senior officials of National Bank of Pakistan who had squandered Rs 
52 billion of the bank s funds. Malik Qasim who is appalled by the 
extent of corruption in public sector banks and DFIs, says he has 
proposed some changes in the rules of financial institutions. The 
State Bank of Pakistan which has the primary responsibility to 
supervise the banks is also at it, along with the Pakistan Banking 
Council. But how could they improve the situation when a large number 
of politically influenced loans were still being given, which may 
aggravate the loan default further?
There are disturbing reports that the Social Action Programme funds, 
inclusive of World Bank funds, are being used more to provide jobs 
under it than to realise the original purpose for which the programme 
was launched with large external assistance, and for which Rs 12 
billion from the Privatisation fund is being drawn this year after Rs 
11 billion was used last year.
The ambitious self-employment schemes for the young with the 
assistance of bank funds, too, have grounded to a halt following 
embezzlements of the funds by executives of National Bank and Habib 
Bank. The long hands of corruption seem to spare no sector, small or 
big. Ultimately even President Leghari has been forced to admit the 
diabolical extent of corruption, particularly in the police service 
where police stations are sold to the higher bidder among police 
officers, who are then free to make as much money as they can.
When legislators, senior officers, and even local councillors behave 
in this manner, corruption has to multiply to the extent that we are 
condemned as the third most corrupt country in the world.
Fighting corruption is a sham exercise. Hence the FACC, Prime 
Minister s Inspection Team, anti-corruption departments in the 
provinces and Chief Ministers inspection teams have not been able to 
do much except catching some small fry or shaming a few big ones at 
times. But if real changes do not take place soon, we may take top 
place in the table of the corrupt nations. It is time to think very 
seriously.

<a name="theg">The grand design </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mazdak
NORMALLY, given the way our tax money is misused, I am against public 
waste in any form. But there are occasions where a bit of constructive 
destruction, to coin a phrase, is fully justified.
Take the huge, monstrous building nearing completion on Islamabad s 
Constitution Avenue as a glaring example. The sign outside this 
hideosity proclaims it to be the Prime Minister s Secretariat, 
although why our head of government would want to step inside this 
horror is beyond me, specially as she did not approve its design in 
the first place. Adorned with every architectural cliche in the book, 
the structure is a jumble of domes, arches, minarets and other 
assorted kitsch. Even though this avenue does not exactly serve as a 
showplace for aesthetically pleasing buildings, the other structures 
are models of elegance when compared to this eyesore.
There is a strong case for demolishing it and starting again from 
scratch. Although what is wrong with the present PM s Secretariat is 
not clear located in the Federal Co-operative Bank building, there is 
no reason for it to move. And considering that the FCB has not been 
much of a success, to put it mildly, why not just shut it down? This 
way, we can recover some of the money already wasted on the under- 
construction PM s Secretariat.
Ultimately, public buildings say a lot about how a nation views 
itself. What does the new PM s Secretariat say about us? With its 
mock-Moghul style and pseudo- Islamic pretensions, as well as its 
gaudily ostentatious adornments, the building is a very revealing 
statement about the level of taste that prevails among our ruling 
elite s. Classic Moghul and Islamic architecture had a sweep and a 
grandeur that have eluded the architect of the PM s Secretariat 
completely. Indeed, the current, Zia-inspired fashion of sticking 
domes and arches on everything has cheapened and devalued the building 
traditions of our ancestors.
The extent to which this madness has been taken is highlighted by the 
incident involving Kenzo Tange, one of the world s foremost 
architects. Commissioned to design the Supreme Court building in 
Islamabad during Bhutto s tenure, he found himself being asked to make 
repeated changes in his design by Zia who was obsessed by a desire to 
 Islamise the building. Finally, the architect got so fed up during 
yet another presentation that he hurled his drawings on the table and 
told all present to do what they wished with them, stormed out and 
flew back to Japan in his private plane. Fortunately, even Zia and his 
flunkies could not completely ruin the original concept, and the new 
Supreme Court building still retains elements that show Kenzo Tange s 
brilliance. The bad news is that right next to it much like a 
garbage dump in the middle of a formal garden stands the grotesque 
new PM s Secretariat.
Another example of bad taste though fortunately on a much smaller 
scale stands at the oddly-named Zero Point as you enter Islamabad. 
The previous chairman of CDA a gentleman famous for his generosity 
with the capital s expensive plots decided to beautify the city by 
erecting a baradari on the island dividing the road. This grotesque 
structure, devoid of taste and context, mars the approach into the 
capital with its fake Moghul design. Soon, no doubt, its concrete 
exterior will be covered with some form of tiles which will acquire a 
layer of dust and grime. Over three million rupees have been spent on 
this ugly carbuncle, and at least as much will be required to finish 
it. I say it should be literally finished by pulling it down to avoid 
throwing good money after bad.
It is remarkable that in nearly five decades of independence, we 
should have so few well-designed public buildings. Nayyar Dada s 
Alhamra Arts Complex in Lahore comes immediately to mind with its 
sculpted mass and the richness of its red brick exterior. The Faisal 
Mosque in Islamabad, designed by a Turkish architect, blends the 
traditional Islamic style with modern lines. The Serena hotels in 
Faisalabad and Quetta have successfully incorporated local themes and 
styles into contemporary designs. The new boarding school near 
Sheikhupura, now nearing completion and funded by private 
contributions, promises to be an exciting campus. Designed by Kamil 
Khan Mumtaz, the author of Architecture in Pakistan , the school will 
break new ground in Pakistan.
All in all, this is not a very long list, and several of the buildings 
mentioned here have been constructed by private funds, and a large 
proportion have been designed by foreign architects. But it is not 
that our architects are incapable of good design a number of private 
houses albeit far too few are stunning samples of clean, 
functional form. It is a fact that when government agencies (which 
commission the overwhelming bulk of public structures) hire architects 
and prepare design briefs, they are not qualified to do either. In 
being penny wise, they are pound foolish. In addition, corruption is 
now so much a part of government construction that good architects 
prefer to stay well away from the PWD/KDA/CDA grid. Before being 
appointed, an architect is routinely supposed to give a kickback. The 
result is that second-raters without moral qualms get government 
contracts and churn out the rubbish we see around us every day.
If we have to put up with poor governance, can t we at least expect 
good taste from our rulers?</pre><pre><hr>

<a name="3nat">3-Nation hockey tournament gets under way today</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Walter Fernandez
KARACHI, Oct 12 The nine-match three-city Three-Nation Triangular 
Hockey Tournament involving host Pakistan, Germany and South Korea 
gets under way at the astro-turf Hockey Club of Pakistan Stadium here 
on Friday.
In the opener, Germany, recent winners of the Champions Trophy for a 
record sixth time at Berlin, square off against Asian Games gold 
medalists South Korea.
Host and World Champions Pakistan face off South Korea the following 
day. On Sunday, Germany are pitted against Pakistan in the third 
encounter of the series.
At the astro-turf Army Hockey Stadium in Rawalpindi, South Korea will 
meet Pakistan in the fourth game on Oct. 17.
The next day at the same venue Germany will tussle against South Korea 
in the fifth clash and on Oct 19 Pakistan will take on Germany in the 
sixth match of the tournament before the circuit moves on for the 
third and final phase of the series.
At the astro-turf National Hockey Stadium in Lahore, Germany combat 
South Korea in the seventh game of the triangular on Oct 20 and on Oct 
21 Pakistan will duel with South Korea in the eight game.
In the ninth and last skirmish of the triangular tournament, World 
Champions Pakistan battle against Champions Trophy holders Germany on 
Oct 23.
Pakistan team manager Rashid Junior and coach Saeed Khan have named a 
16-man for the first game against South Korea. Rashid Junior, the 
Manager of the team which regained the World Cup at Sydney after 12-
long years last December, he plans to try out all the 29 short-listed 
probables plus one (inside-left Sarwar), in two matches each before 
effecting any changes.
 The doors are wide open for the 1996 Olympic team. If they have the 
stuff in them they should prove it now, concluded the Pakistan team 
manager.
Pakistan s ace centre-forward Kamran Ashraf, who sustained a right 
wrist fracture during the Champions Trophy camp, was at the HCP 
Stadium today. He told this correspondent that his orthopaedic surgeon 
has said it would take another two weeks for his injury to heal and 
then after two weeks physiotherapy he would be ready to return to 
competitive hockey.
Germany s Paul Lissek, the top-ranked coach on the world hockey 
circuit at present, mentioned he has brought only nine players from 
the 16-member squad that regained the Champions Trophy at Berlin.
As Germany will only finalise their 1996 Atlanta Olympic team in June 
next year, all the players who will be competing in the triangular 
tournament have an opportunity to prove their worth and impress their 
coach Paul Lissek.
South Korea s Manager Kim Sang Ryul told Dawn there is only one 
change in the squad that beat Pakistan in last year s Asian Games 
hockey semi-finals at Hiroshima. Yoo, Seung Jin, a youngster, has 
replaced Park Shin Heum.
Asked as to how he fancies his team s chances in the triangular he 
said Both Germany and Pakistan are the top teams in the world and 
they should start off as the favourites. However we are lucky to have 
been provided a chance to play in the triangular and this will greatly 
help in our preparations for the Olympics. 
The squads are as follows 
GERMANY Christopher Reitz and Ingo Kruger (goalkeepers), Jan-Peter 
Tewes, Tobias Warweg, Patrik Bellenbaum, Henning Helweg, Cristian 
Mayerhofer, Florian Kunz, Frank Gemmrig, Klaus Michler (Captain),

<a name="aami">AAMIR S ALL-ROUND SHOW Pakistan turn tables on Lanka in Sharjah</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SHARJAH (United Arab Emirates), Oct 12 Opener Aamir Sohail produced a 
heart-warming allround performance which paved the way for Pakistan to 
take a turbo start in the three-nation Champions Trophy cricket 
tournament at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium here on Thursday.
The world champions, entering the tournament in Sharjah not as 
favourites probably for the first time since 1984, smashed Sri Lanka 
by 82 runs to salvage some pride after they were embarrassed 2-1 by 
the Islanders who won both the Test and one-day series by an identical 
2-1 margins.
Aamir Sohail, popularly known as the heart-throb of the Pakistan team, 
scored a superb 85 off 110 balls with the aid of four boundaries to 
help Pakistan post a highly respectable 264 for seven from 50 overs.
The left-hander then produced his career best figures of four for 22 
runs to restrict Sri Lanka to a paltry 182 for eight. Sohail s 
previous best was three for 33 against Zimbabwe at Harare earlier this 
year.
Sohail, for his match-winning performance, was later adjudged the Man-
of-the-Match.
Besides Sohail, Inzamamul Haq scored a sparkling 59-ball 69 while in-
form Salim Elahi contributed a solid 74-ball 50.
Ramiz Raja though could score only 12, managed to achieve a personal 
milestone when he became the third Pakistani after Javed Miandad 
(7,237) and Salim Malik (5,270) and 11th in the world to complete 
5,000 runs in one-dayer.
Watching Pakistan perform today, it was very much evident that they 
had prepared a game plan and religiously followed it. The batting, 
which let Pakistan down in the Tests as well as in one-day games 
against Sri Lanka, appeared more sensible and professional as evident 
>from  the fact that at the half way mark, the scoreboard read 111 for 
one while after the completion of 40 overs, the scoreboard showed 181 
for three. In the remaining 10 overs, the Pakistan middle-order 
yielded 83 runs.
As far as the bowlers are concerned, they bowled strictly according to 
the field with a tight line and length giving no liberties to the 
Lankan batsmen.
The Pakistan bowlers accuracy can be judged from the fact that all the 
eight batsmen were dismissed inside the 30 yard circle. In fact, only 
Ranatunga was caught at the 30-yard circle while the others were 
either bowled or caught close to the bat in front or behind the 
wickets.
Sri Lanka were unlikely to post any real threat to Pakistan after they 
lost the top seven batsmen in a space of 80 runs to slump from 33 for 
no wicket to 133 for seven.
None of the Sri Lankan batsmen could offer any significant resistance 
against the determined Pakistani bowlers. Only Kumar Dharmasena (30 
not out from 64 balls), Jayasuriya (24 off 34 balls with three 
boundaries) and Rawan Kalpage (22 from 59 balls) managed to cross the 
20 figure.
Besides, Aamir Sohail, highly promising Saqlain Mushtaq exhibited his 
potential once again when he captured two wickets for 30 runs from his 
quota of 10 overs. His success over Jayasuriya and Aravinda de Silva 
in successive overs (12th and 14th of the innings) laid the foundation 
of a comfortable victory.
The other encouraging news for Pakistan was bowling by Waqar Younis. 
Younis, playing his first major match exactly after 30 days, generated 
good speed from an unsporting track.
Earlier in the morning, Ramiz Raja defeated Arjuna Ranatunga on the 
spin of coin and without hesitation elected to bat on a placid and 
wicket tailor-made for the stroke-makers.
Pakistan openers Aamir Sohail and Salim Elahi helped Raja with a 
magnificent century stand when they put on 107 runs off 143 balls. It 
was their first century stand besides two half century partnerships in 
lst four matches.
The two batsmen dominated the Sri Lankan bowlers who even struggled to 
beat the bat. The two powerful hitters played shots at their will 
though on a number of occasions they failed to beat the athletic Sri 
Lankan fielders.
Aamir Sohail was first to reach his half century which he achieved off 
67 balls with the aid of four blistering carpeted boundaries.
Immediately after Sohail reached his 14th 50 of career, Salim Elahi 
also reached the landmark for the first time in four matches. Elahi, 
whose previous scores are 102 not out, 47 and 30, faced 72 balls and 
struck two boundaries and a superb straight six off Hathurusinghe.
After Pakistan lost Elahi and Raja in a space of 31 runs, Inzamamul 
Haq walked in to join Aamir Sohail and straightaway made his 
intentions clear by playing some very forceful shots. One of his three 
sixes fell at least 40 yards behind the 70-yard boundary while one 
fell in the enclosure at mid-wicket.
An agile Sri Lankan fielding deprived Inzamam of at least a couple of 
more boundaries and he had to contend with a solitary hit to the 
fence.
Inzamam, who raced to his 22nd half century off 46 balls with a four 
and two sixes, was finally out when Sanath Jayasuriya brought off a 
fine tumbling catch behind square leg to end a commanding 59-ball 69 
with three sixes and a four.
Together with Aamir Sohail, who was the third batsmen out at the score 
of 162 in 36.2 overs, Inzamam put on 51 runs off 46 balls.
Aamir Sohail, who even lost his temper when Ramiz Raja refused to take 
an easy single, was unlucky to miss his century when wicketkeeper 
Rumesh Kaluwitharna caught the left-hander in the second attempt after 
the batsman got an inside edge while trying to cut off Muralitharan.
Saeed Anwar, who batted at an unusual No 5 spot, had an eventful 
session in the middle. He survived a stumping appeal and on the very 
next ball Muralitharan failed to hold onto a return catch. The next 
ball saw his dismissal when he was smartly stumped by the wicketkeeper 
off Jayasuriya.
With the slog overs already started, the rest of the batsmen had to 
throw away their willows at every ball and thus could not find 
themselves amongst notable scorers.
However, Mushtaq Ahmad and Waqar Younis delighted a crowd of around 
2,000 with some fine fireworks as the two scored 18 runs off the last 
eight balls, including 15 runs off the final over of the innings. 
Mushtaq scored nine off three balls, including two boundaries, while 
Waqar remained unbeaten on nine from five balls. Reuter

<a name="isla">Islamabad seeks Indian pledge safety of cricketers</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
NEW DELHI, Oct 13 Pakistan has asked India to guarantee the safety of 
its cricket team during a possible visit for the 1996 World Cup 
tournament in March.
Pakistan s official letter to India s Ministry of External Affairs 
this week follows a sustained campaign by the Hindu militant Shiv Sena 
group against the team s visit, they said.
He said Pakistan has also demanded an explicit assurance from the 
government of India guaranteeing the security of Pakistani cricketers 
and officials accompanying them. 
Bombay-based Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray has threatened to stop 
Pakistan from playing in India should it qualify to play in the 
quarter-final matches, two of which are to be held in India.
The initial matches of the tournament, starting on February 14, are to 
be played in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, with each host playing its 
matches at home.
If it qualifies, Pakistan could play in the quarter-final round on 
March 9 in Bangalore or in Madras on March 11.
The semi-finals will be played in Calcutta on March 13 and in the 
northern Indian town of Mohali on March 14. The final match will be 
played in Lahore.

<a name="basi">BASIT, MOIN Ramiz steers Pakistan to victory over W.I.</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SHARJAH (United Arab Emirates), Oct 13 Skipper Ramiz Raja played an 
innings of his life which helped Pakistan to win the final match of 
the first round in the sixth Champions Trophy cricket tournament by 15 
runs at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium here on Friday.
Almost a packed-to-capacity crowd witnessed Raja at his brilliant best 
as he pulled his team out of the woods by scoring a magnificent 
unbeaten 104 which enabled the world champions to accumulate 242 for 
four in 50 overs.
Raja s century, which was his first since Feb 4, 1993, helped him 
become Pakistan s leading century-maker with nine. Javed Miandad and 
Saeed Anwar have eight centuries against their names.
Raja, adjudged Man-of-the-Match, then for the first time showed his 
leadership qualities when he made timely changes in the bowling to see 
almost all his decisions go his way, as the West Indies were bowled 
out for 227 with six balls to spare.
Raja s three decisions at crucial stages of the game swung the match 
in favour of Pakistan who now lead the points table with 10.
Raja brought in off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq in the 11th over of the 
innings knowing very well that only two fielders were outside the 30-
yard circle. At that stage, Brian Lara was in a very punishing mood as 
he had already scored 21 runs from 14 balls with a six and two 
boundaries, all off Waqar Younis third over.
However, Saqlain struck on his very first ball when a genius like Lara 
tried to hit the off-spinner against the spin to be caught at the 30-
yard circle by Aqib Javed.
Raja then introduced Aamir Sohail in the 14th over of the innings who 
complemented his skipper by accounting for Sherwin Campbell. Campbell, 
who scored 86 against Sri Lanka in the tournament opener, scored a 46-
ball 42 with six fours including 14 runs off Zafar Iqbal s first and 
only over of the match.
And when Richie Richardson plundered Saqlain Mushtaq and Mushtaq Ahmad 
to all parts of the ground, Raja brought in Aqib Javed for his second 
spell. Aqib immediately struck when he shattered the stumps of the 
West Indies captain to reduce the Caribbeans to 124 for four in 25 
overs.
Richardson, who scored 67 on Wednesday, hit a six and a boundary in 
his 34 which came off 50 balls.
Shivnarine Chanderpaul, who was caught by Salim Elahi at square-leg 
after scoring 37 runs off 51 balls with two boundaries and a six, 
dismissal at the hands of Waqar Younis eventually was the last nail in 
the West Indies coffins as the Caribbeans fell short by 15 runs 
despite a last ditch efforts by the later order batsmen especially by 
Roger Harper alone fought a lost battle and remained unbeaten on 43 
off 57 balls with two fours and a six.
Saqlain Mushtaq, who was hit for 23 runs from his first three overs, 
hit back to finish as pick of the Pakistan bowlers. He finished with 
four for 47.
Waqar Younis showed improvement in bowling rhythm and speed but lacked 
accuracy as he finished with two wickets for 51 runs from nine overs.
Earlier, Ramiz Raja defeated Richie Richardson on the spin of coin and 
elected to bat. But only after 17.1 overs with the scoreboard reading 
49, it appeared that the decision has backfired as Pakistan plunged 
into crisis by losing three wickets including that of in-form Salim 
Elahi.
However, at that stage, Ramiz Raja and Basit Ali joined hands and got 
themselves involved in a rescue operation. They batted slowly and 
surely to graft themselves before launching an assault.
Basit Ali though could not repeat his heroics against the same 
opposition two years back when he had scored an unbeaten 127 but his 
today s knock was as much valuable as was in 1993.
Basit not only scored a superb 64, but he put on 149 runs off 174 
balls for the fourth wicket with Ramiz Raja. Basit, who scored his 
first half century since Oct 28 last year when he remained unbeaten on 
52 against South Africa, faced 87 balls and hit a four and a six off 
Phil Simmons over mid-wicket. His ninth half century came off 72 balls 
with a six and a boundary.
Ramiz Raja, captaining Pakistan in his fifth one-day international, on 
the other hand kept his head down and kept pushing the ball for single 
and twos.
The only blemish in the captain s knock of Raja was a dropped catch by 
Roger Harper at short mid-wicket that brought him his half century 
>from  94 balls with three fours. However, Raja was clever enough to 
cash in on this opportunity and return unbeaten for the 13th time in 
his 164-match career.
Raja reached the coveted three figure mark off 133 balls with seven 
fours and a six with a very crispy off-the-toes shot on the first ball 
of the final over to become Pakistan highest century-getter with nine.
Raja came out of his shell soon after reaching his 50 to play some 
very delightful shots in his next 50 which took him only 39 balls and 
included four boundaries and a huge six off Ian Bishop.
However, it was the brilliance of wicketkeeper Moin Khan that for a 
little moment overshadowed Ramiz Raja s century.
The wicketkeeper, who has established himself as a dependable batsman 
after scoring 274 runs in the Test series against Sri Lanka, blasted 
Ian Bishop for three successive sixes off the final three balls of the 
innings to remind Imran Khan s onslaught against Joel Garner at the 
very same ground some seven years back.
Moin, who later accounted for four batsmen behind the wickets, scored 
a hurricane 27 off 10 balls with three sixes and a four.
With Raja, Moin equalled the world record of scoring 27 runs in the 
final over. The previous record was also held by the Pakistan pair of 
Salim Malik and Asif Mujtaba who struck Muttiah Muralitharan for an 
equal number of runs last year at Colombo.
Bishop, who had conceded 19 runs from the final six overs, finished 
with one for 78 from 10 overs while Anderson Cummins chipped in with 
two wickets for 31 runs.

<a name="west">West Indies coast to easy win against Pakistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Samiul Hasan
SHARJAH (United Arab Emirates), Oct 15 West Indies kept the sixth 
Champions Trophy wide open when they defeated Pakistan by four wickets 
in the first match of the second round here at the Sharjah Cricket 
Stadium on Sunday.
The defending champions, set a modest victory target of 195 in 50 
overs by Pakistan, suffered mixed fortunes before achieving the score 
in 39.1 overs.
By virtue of this victory, the West Indies are tied with Sri Lanka 
with five points. Pakistan have 10 points from three games. The West 
Indies play their last league match against Sri Lanka on Monday.
If the West Indies defeat Sri Lanka on Monday and then on Tuesday Sri 
Lankans defeat Pakistan, all the teams then will be locked at 10 
points each. It will then be the run-rate that will decide the two 
finalists.
At present, Pakistan has an average of 4.66 runs per over while the 
West Indies has an average of 4.64. Sri Lanka, who have two matches 
and appear to be in the best position as compared to the other two who 
have just one match remaining, has an average of 4.16 runs per over.
Nevertheless, if the West Indies lose to Sri Lanka tomorrow, the 
Islanders and Pakistan will go through the final. A thrilling finish 
is on the cards for the cricket fans.
Reverting to today s match, the Caribbeans fully capitalised the 
opportunity of facing a weak Pakistan which had lost the services of 
Saeed Anwar and Aamir Sohail because of injuries.
While Saeed is suffering from malaria and typhoid, Aamir had to miss 
the match because of swollen shoulder.
Pakistan were so handicapped and short of players that despite playing 
with an injured Inzamamul Haq, they could field in only four 
specialist batsmen.
Four suicidal run outs because of foolish play starting from when 
Pakistan were 139 for one in 34.1 overs that saw eight wickets falling 
for the addition of another 42 runs in 13.1 overs, added salt to the 
wounds as the world champions struggled to 194 for nine in 50 overs.
The Caribbean batsmen than fully exposed a half-fit Waqar Younis and 
the limitations of Pakistan bowlers by racing to 148 for three after 
the halfway mark to struck the final nail in Pakistan s coffins.
And although West Indies lost Lara, Richardson, Chanderpaul and 
Simmons in a space of 42 runs to slump to 189 for six, no hope was 
left when Ramiz Raja dropped Roger Harper off Aqib Javed at mid-on 
when the West Indies still needed six for victory.
West Indies openers Stuart Williams, later adjudged Man-of-the-Match, 
and Sherwin Campbell (20) laid the foundation of a comfortable victory 
when they posted 44 runs for the first wicket in just 41 balls before 
Campbell departed falling to Mohammad Akram. Campbell s brief 13-ball 
innings included four boundaries.
Majestic Brian Lara joined Williams and continued the good job which 
was started by Campbell. Both Lara and Williams ruthlessly hit the 
Pakistan bowlers to all parts of the field.
Williams was first to reach his half century with a delightful 
boundary, his seventh of the innings, off 51 balls. Besides, he also 
hit a six off Aqib Javed at mid-off.
He finally fell to off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq when he attempted 
another six only to hit the ball into the hands of a waiting Zafar 
Iqbal at mid-on. William s 63-ball 57 included a 2.six and seven 
fours.
Together with Lara, Williams added 65 runs for the second wicket in 12 
overs (60 balls).
Lara, in the meantime, continued to hit some sparkling shots. A six 
off Mushtaq Ahmad at square-leg was a treat to watch. It was a real 
entertainment to see Lara who has made headlines all over the world 
because of his magnificent batting.
Lara rode his luck well when Inzamamul Haq dropped him in the first 
slip off Mohammad Akram. Lara was then 40 and the West Indies 134 for 
two.
Lara punished Akram for getting his edge by hitting the very next ball 
over mid-on and then flicking for a boundary to reach his half century 
>from  55 balls with the help of five boundaries and a couple of sixes.
Lara departed three balls later when Basit Ali caught him a mid-wicket 
off Mushtaq Ahmad.
Richardson then played a little jab of an innings when he scored 34 
>from  50 balls including two boundaries and a six.
When the West Indies achieved the target in 39.1 overs, Roger Harper 
was batting on 5 and Courtney Browne was 2.
For Pakistan, Mohammad Akram finished with two wickets for 36 runs 
while Saqlain bagged two wickets for 42. Mushtaq accounted for Lara 
conceding 43 runs in 10 overs after being hit for 20 in the first 
four.
Aqib, who made Lara dance a little, finished with one wicket for 41 
>from  8.1 overs after being struck for 18 from the first two overs.
Earlier, Pakistan put into bat, were off to a flying start when 
prolific Salim Elahi and Ramiz Raja put on 72 runs for the first 
wicket in 18.2 overs. It was a partnership which wiped off tears after 
Saeed Anwar and Aamir Sohail had to miss the game because of injuries 
and Pakistan playing with just four batsmen.
The second wicket partnership between Salim Elahi and Inzamamul Haq of 
67 in 16 overs further consolidated Pakistan s position.
Nevertheless, Pakistan middle-order batsmen squandered the chance of 
posting a good score with some pathetic batting and stupid running 
between the wickets. From 139 for one in 34.2 overs, Pakistan 
collapsed to 181 for nine in 47.3 overs.
Salim Elahi, Moin Khan, Zafar Iqbal and Saqlain Mushtaq took 
unnecessarily tested the skills of West Indies fielders while Basit 
Ali, who was the seventh man out, played a shot which was highly 
irresponsible considering the position in which Pakistan was at that 
stage.
Salim Elahi was easily the best Pakistan batsmen as he has been since 
making his debut three weeks ago. The teenage from Multan batted very 
sensibly and showed that he was learning with the passage of time.
Elahi scored an attractive 66 off 109 balls with the aid of five 
blistering boundaries. He achieved his second half century in six 
games from 77 balls with the help of four hits to the fence.
Inzamamul Haq, nursing a groin injury, limped around for his 34 off 51 
balls with two boundaries.
Ramiz Raja, opening the innings for Pakistan for the first time since 
May 1993, scored a painstaking 20 off 50 balls with one four. His 
today s dismissal was because of a careless shot when he danced down 
to wicket to Phil Simmons only to find his symmetry of stumps 
shattered. His today s innings was a complete contrast to Friday s one 
when he had played a highly responsible and perhaps one of the best 
innings of his career.

<a name="germ">Germany overpower Pakistan in 3-nation hockey</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Walter Fernandez
KARACHI, Oct 13 Olympic gold medalist and Champions Trophy holders 
Germany overpowered World Champions Pakistan by two goals to nil in 
the third match of the Three-Nation Hockey Tournament for the State 
Life Champions Trophy at the Astro-Turf Hockey Club of Pakistan (HCP) 
Stadium here on Sunday.
At half-time the Germans led by one goal to nil. The Germans today 
inducted fresh blood in their playing eleven in reserve goalkeeper 
Ingo Kruger, Dirk Bruse, Frank Gemmrig and Ulrich Moissel to groom 
them in international competition and they did quite well to smother 
the challenge of Pakistan. Towards the finale all 16 players of the 
German squad were seen in the playing arena at one time or another.
Pakistan took the field without regular skipper Shahbaz Ahmad, who was 
compelled to undergo a one-match suspension after being ousted by a 
red card in the game against South Korea on Saturday.
The Pakistan forward line lacked cohesion in every sense of the word 
and solely depended on individual effort to break down the opposition, 
which in the final reckoning proved to be inadequate.
Pakistan Manager Abdul Rashid Junior gave wingers Mohammad Ali and 
Asif Ahmad maximum exposure and they lacked not only finesse but also 
the basic skills to rip through the wing at this level of the game.
Inside-right Atif Bashir and spearhead Aleem seemed to be total 
misfits and Mohammad Shahbaz Junior was left to fend for himself in 
the inside-left position.
In mid-field Mohammad Usman at right half stood out and he was given 
admirable support by pivot Mohammad Khalid and left half Khawaja 
Mohammad Junaid.
In the deep, left back Atiq was given a rough ride by the German right 
wing and had it not been for some smart work by right back Rana 
Mujahid and acting captain Mansoor Ahmad under the bar the margin of 
Pakistan s defeat might just have been larger.
If Germany dominated the first session with controlled and relaxed 
hockey, Pakistan came back briefly in the second by sustaining immense 
pressure for a 12-minute spree but without being able the break the 
German resistance.
The Germans surged into the ascendancy in the very 8th minute through 
Oliver Domke slammed the ball home after intercepting a Christian 
Mayerhoffer short pass from just outside the circle on the left.
Then in the 16th minute, a classic one-two move between Henning Helweg 
and Ulrich Moissel was brought to an end before reaching danger 
proportions by the Pakistan deep defence.
In the 25th minute another German onslaught resulted in the first 
penalty corner award to them. But Christian Mayerhoffer s try went a 
trifle wide off the mark.
Germany continued with their attacks and in the 29th minute, Dirk 
Bruse found his attempt miss the target narrowly.
Pakistan came nearest to restoring parity in the 30th minute but 
inside-left Mohammad Shahbaz muffed an easy chance after a 30-metre 
solo dribble.
Soon after the resumption Pakistan went all out in search of the 
equaliser and unleashed eight concerted attacks but could not find 
that elusive goal because of good defensive work from the Germans and 
inefficient marksmanship. Even the two penalty corners gained by 
Pakistan in that period was to no avail.
In the 60th minute, Germany in a counter-attack earned their third 
penalty corner and Christian Bechman sounded the board on the second 
attempt on a rebound from goalkeeper Mansoor Ahmad s pads.
Four minutes later Mansoor Ahmad came to Pakistan s rescue by 
effecting a splendid save.
Then almost on the stroke of time, Pakistan gained their third penalty 
corner but right winger Ejaz Ahmad sent the ball wide off the far 
post.
The teams were 
GERMANY Ingo Kruger, Michael Green, Dirk Bruse, Patrik Bellenguam, 
Frank Gemmrig, Jan Peter Tewes, Ulrich Moissl, Henning Helweg, Florian 
Kunz, Christoph Bechmann, Tobias Warweg, Cristinn Stengler, Klaus 
Michler (Captain), Oliver Domke, Cristian Mayerhoffer.
PAKISTAN Mansoor Ahmad (Captain), Rana Mujahid, M. Atiq, Mohammad 
Usman, Mohammad Khalid, Khawaja Mohammad Junaid, Mohammad Ali, Atif 
Bashir, Aleem, Mohammad Shahbaz, Asif Ahmad, Ejaz Ahmad.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Farhana Ayaz
RAWALPINDI, Oct 17 Asian champions South Korea were denied a serial 
win by the new-look world champions Pakistan with 2-2 tie here in the 
opening fixture of the second leg of Three-Nation Triangular State 
Life Champions Trophy being played at the astro-turf field of 
Rawalpindi Army Hockey Stadium, Tuesday.
The Koreans were leading 1-0 at the half time. Korea displayed agility 
through out the game. Pakistani bench tried out seven of its on the 
edge players to adjudge their future before the Atlanta Olympics.
At the onset, both teams distributed the ball through long hitting to 
open up the field, utilising one such change into the opening 
 minutes skipper Shahbaz connected a change from right with a top of 
the circle hit but keeper Koo Jin Soo was equally steady under the bar 
to squash it.
A few minutes later Korea powered in with a flawless right trio move 
initiated from the centre line found Kang Keon Wook charging in 
unmarked from top of the shooting zone for a sizzling full bloodied 
drive but Mansoor Ahmed brought a fabulous save.
After that Koreans gained control by keeping possession of the ball 
launching in successive inroads into Pakistani defences, the onslaught 
paid the dividends, although there were a number of neat and first 
time thwarting by the world champ deep defence.
Korea moved ahead on its first penalty corner awarded after centre-
forward Kang Keon charging in for an attempt was sandwiched 
by two defenders. Korea s specialist Kim Yong was brought into 
 the game to convert the penalty corner and positioning himself 
on the top right Yong sent a high push into the left corner in the 
15th minute.
Koreans stepped up the tempo and earned two more penalty corners, 
they used similar technique seasoned Mansoor remained unbeatable. 
Mansoor also figured in diving save after left inner Choi Jung had 
hustled inside the danger area after dribbling through the 
Pakistani defences, and a falling Mansoor, also beaten, feebly 
 spooned in with his hockey stick to stop the motion and dashing 
Choi after recollecting pushed the ball off target from the left.
Pakistan brought in Shahbaz Jr. to strengthen its forwardline in the 
21st minute.
Before the breather, Pakistan looking for equaliser missed out on 
two chances by failing to convert the first penalty corner in the 
27th minute in three separate attempts and then skipper Shahbaz aim 
on an open try went far on the left goal post on a fabulous lay off 
>from  Shahbaz Jr. who had beaten the whole of Koreans deep defence 
charging in from right. 
For Pakistan the newer lot produced better coordination and but for 
atleast half a dozen missed opportunities. Pakistan was rather 
 unlucky not having levelled the scores when Shahbaz Jr. s left 
 flick landed on top left of the high bar in the 40th minute of 
 the play. However, moments later, Danish Kaleem converted the second 
penalty corner to make it 1-1. The equaliser brought better 
command into the ranks of hosts as they thumped in some well 
knitted moves to topple the opponents.
During the 45th minute Korean strike player Shin Seok Kyo was 
penalised with a yellow car by German umpire M.Myer after a wrong 
tackle against Pakistani striker, the incident worsened after the 
Korean full back protested abusively and the umpire changed the 
penalty to red card, which means Shin is out of the vital game 
against Germans today. 
With ten players, Korea did not lack any aggression and on a open run 
in from right flank centre-forward Kang slashing shot found the gap 
between keeper Mansoor and the left goal post to put his team ahead 
again in the 48th minute. 
Efforts to equalise from Pakistan got squashed when on three penalty 
corners Usman Malik failed to stop the hit in and Pakistan failed 
to shoot in.
Four minutes before the final whistle, a diving Shahbaz Jr. connected 
a rebound from the centre of the shooting range to restore parity to 
the jubilation of a sizeable crowd.
The fixture between Korea and Germany is scheduled for 3.30 pm. 
Teams Korea Koo Jin Soo, Shin, Seok, Han Beung, Yoon Myung, Cho 
Myoung, Jeon Hong, Kim Jong, Joo Shong, Kang Koen, Choi Jung, Jeong

<a name="wind">W. Indies snatch 3-run thriller from Lanka</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Special Representative
SHARJAH, Oct 17 Hashan Tillekeratne overshadowed a magnificent 169 by 
Brian Lara as Sri Lanka put up a fairy tale show against the West 
Indies before surrendering by five runs in an exciting Champions 
Trophy match on Monday.
In one of the most thrilling matches ever played in one-day cricket 
which must have stopped the hearts of many, Sri Lanka were bowled out 
for 329 in 49.3 overs while chasing a mammoth 333 for seven in 50 
overs scored by the West Indies.
It was a new match aggregate of 662 for 17 wickets in 99.3 overs 
breaking the 12-year-old record of 626 for 14 wickets in 120 overs set 
between Sri Lanka and Pakistan in the 1983 World Cup match at Swansea.
In addition to this, Sri Lanka also earned the distinction of scoring 
the highest innings total while batting second. Their 329 in 49.3 
overs eclipsed the previous best of 289 for seven in 40 overs, 
interestingly, scored by them against India at Bombay in 1987.
Sri Lanka, needing an average of 6.66 from the word go, sprinted to 
100 for two in 10.1 overs before they suffered a collapse and slumped 
to 103 for five in 11.5 overs with defeat staring right in their 
faces.
However, the lions from the Pearl Island did not give up the fight, 
thanks to a fabulous 100 by Hashan Tillekeratne who when scored his 
third run became Sri Lanka s fifth batsman after Arjuna Ranatunga, 
Aravinda de Silva, Roshan Mahanama and Asanka Gurusinha to score 2,000 
runs in one-day internationals.
Tillekeratne, who faced 105 balls and struck four fours and a six, 
batted gallantly and almost single-handedly put Sri Lanka in sight of 
victory when they needed five runs off the last four balls with the 
last batsman in.
However, a shot, which for the first time appeared going over the 
square-leg boundary, was held by Stuart Williams right on the ropes to 
give West Indies victory.
The Islanders may have lost the match but Sri Lankans stood tall on 
Monday. That was some innings. Sri Lanka rose to the occasion, fought 
a lost battle and nearly turned the tides in their favour. Credit can 
also not be taken away from the West Indies who lived by their words, 
even if it was a cat s whisker.
Tillekeratne, who was adjudged Man-of-the-Series against Pakistan, was 
involved in three great partnerships that evoked a ray of hope in the 
Lankan dressing room.
For the seventh wicket, Tillekeratne added 68 runs off 90 balls with 
Roshan Mahanama who scored an attractive 76 off 78 balls with five 
boundaries and a six.
Tillekeratne, for the seventh wicket, put on 86 runs from 80 balls 
with Chandika Hathurusinghe who was out after scoring a quickfire 45 
off 43 balls with four boundaries.
In Association with Kumar Dharmasena for the eighth wicket, 
Tillekeratne added 49 runs from 33 balls. Dharmasena s contribution 
was 24 from 19 balls with two boundaries.
Sri Lanka, who were 159 for six after the halfway mark as compared to 
West Indies 139 for three, scored 170 runs in the final 25 overs. 
West Indies, on the other hand, hit 194 runs in the second half of 
their innings.
Earlier, Kumar Dharmasena deprived Brian Lara of another world record 
when he bowled the scorer of 375 and 501 runs in Test and first-class 
cricket respectively for 169.
The 26-year-old Trinidadian was then only 21 runs short of eclipsing 
Vivian Richards record of 189 not out against England at Manchester 
in 1984. Lara, at that time, had 33 balls to spare.
Brian Lara exhibited his brilliance with the willow proving why he is 
considered as the best modern day cricket batsman.
However, his innings was witnessed by not more than 300 spectators 
that had grown after only 57 watched the first ball being bowled by 
Pramodiya Wickremasinghe.
Lara played a champions innings making things look so easy for him. 
Wherever and whenever he wanted to hit a shot, he struck it with a 
perfect timing and ease. Watching him in full throttle, it appeared 
that the fielders would not be able to restrict him from scoring.
Lara faced just 129 balls for his 169 that also included 35 dot balls. 
His masterly knock was sparkled with 15 sizzling boundaries and four 
towering sixes.
Lara achieved his first 50 off 47 balls with five boundaries and a 
six. His second 50 came from 57 balls with six boundaries. His third 
50 was simply magnificent as it took only 21 balls and included four 
boundaries and three sixes.
Nevertheless, unlike the Test innings of 375 against England (a 
chanceless one) and like the knock of 501 not out against Durham (in 
which he was dropped five times inside 100), Lara this time also had 
his share of luck when he was twice dropped and also survived a 
certain run-out.
Lara was first let off by Kaluwitharna off Hathurusinghe when on 10 
and the West Indies on 23 for one. He then survived a run out chance 
on 75 when West Indies were 135 for three when Jayasuriya s throw 
failed to hit the stumps at the non-striker s end. Lara was left 
stranded almost half way down the track.
Sri Lankan skipper Arjuna Ranatunga was guilty of dropping Lara 
immediately after the left-hander reached his sixth century of career 
when he failed to hold on to the catch off Hathurusinghe at short-mid-
wicket. Lara was then 101 and the West Indies on 184 for three in 32.2 
overs.
In the end, nevertheless, it will not be the drop catches that will go 
into the record books. What will go down is that Lara scored 169 which 
was not only his career-best but also the best score in the desert 
city of Sharjah.
Shivnarine Chanderpaul was the other notable scorer after Brian Lara. 
He slammed three sixes, two off the final two deliveries, and two 
boundaries in his 45-ball 62. Together with Lara, Chanderpaul put on 
89 runs for the fifth wicket in 59 balls as the West Indies scored 194 
in the final 25 overs.

<a name="humb">Pakistan humbled by Lanka in Sharjah</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Samiul Hasan
SHARJAH (United Arab Emirates), Oct 17 It was the same old story for 
Pakistan against Sri Lanka when the world champions were thrown out of 
the sixth Champions Trophy on run-rate by the new rivals who humbled 
them by eight wickets in the decisive and final league match of the 
event at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium here on Tuesday.
It was Pakistan s fourth defeat in six matches in an equal number of 
months at the hands of Sri Lanka. Pakistan were blown off in the Asia 
Cup in April and then lost the one-day series 2-1 in Pakistan. In this 
event, Pakistan won the first game by 82 runs and lost the reverse 
match by eight wickets.
After Sri Lanka had managed to increase their run-rate to 4.96 by 
scoring 329 against the West Indies on Monday, Pakistan, who before 
this match had a run-rate of 4.66, needed either an outright win or at 
least 335 runs for place in the final.
But neither of the two happened. Irresponsible, careless and simply 
pathetic batting from the top order allowed Pakistan to post a meagre 
143 in 48.3 overs.
Sri Lanka, whose morale had been boosted by Monday s performance, took 
only 26.5 overs to reach the modest score and for the loss of two 
wickets.
After the completion of the double-league, all the teams were tied at 
10 points each from four matches each. However, the West Indies, with 
a run-rate of 5.17, and Sri Lanka, with a run-rate of 5.05, go through 
to Friday s final while Pakistan, with a run-rate of 4.21, take a 
flight back home on Wednesday.
This tournament and today s match was a complete replica of the Asia 
Cup where Pakistan, after winning a couple of opening games, were 
ousted by Sri Lanka in the final match on better run-rate. Sri Lanka 
qualified for the final before losing to India.
Similarly, Pakistan won the first two games in this event in 
convincing styles before losing the other two with below-par shows to 
make an exit on low run-rate.
While there will be injury excuses ready for the second successive 
disaster, there can be no explanation for the senseless batting by the 
three top batsmen, viz Ramiz Raja, Salim Elahi and Basit Ali.
They were all caught behind the wickets while attempting drives on 
balls which could have been declared wides had they left them go to 
the wicketkeeper.
Out of the three, Ramiz Raja and Basit Ali were both experienced and 
should have known their responsibilities after only four batsmen could 
be fielded in the crucial match as Aamir Sohail and Inzamamul Haq 
aggravated their shoulder and groin injuries respectively to sit on 
the substitute bench.
Ramiz Raja, at least, should have led from the front and left an 
example for others. After all, he was the senior most member of the 
team having the experience of 166 one-day internationals.
But the skipper flashed a wide ball to become the second batsman out 
at the score of 25 in 10.2 overs after young Salim Elahi earned his 
first duck of the career when he fell at the score of 11 in 3.3 overs.
Honestly, except for an unbeaten 104 against the West Indies on 
Friday, the other innings by Ramiz in this tournament were simply 
casual and irresponsible. He danced down the wicket on Sunday against 
the West Indies while in the opener on Thursday last against Sri 
Lanka, he hit the ball into the hands of Hathurusinghe fielding at the 
boundary.
Basit Ali, still remembering his 127 not out here two years ago 
against the West Indies, failed to play his role of a dependable 
batsman. His departure after he had hit a six and a four in his 46-
ball 21 was similar to that of Salim and Ramiz when he edged a wide 
ball into the hands of Mahanama to become the third batsman out at the 
score of 52 in 17.1 overs.
When three regular inform batsmen failed to deliver the goods, only 
fools could have depended on the others.
Aamir Hanif, arriving only on Monday evening as Saeed Anwar s 
replacement, was spectacularly run out by Muttiah Muralitharan after 
making 17 to make Pakistan 63 for four in 21.5 overs. Moin Khan had 
played the ball towards gully and started off. But when he saw 
Muralitharan getting hold of the ball with a huge dive, returned only 
to see Hanif standing besides him at the striker s end.
But even if any hopes were left, they disappeared with the addition of 
only 21 runs in 30 balls when Zafar Iqbal (2) and Moin Khan (16) also 
returned to the pavilion to leave Pakistan precariously placed at 82 
for six in 28.1 overs.
However, Mushtaq Ahmad and Saqlain Mushtaq held the innings together 
and put on 52 runs in 105 balls for the seventh wicket to take the 
score to 134 for six in 45.3 overs before Pakistan lost the remaining 
four wickets for the addition of only nine runs in 10 balls.
Saqlain emerged as the top scorer with a 52-ball 30 with a six and a 
boundary while Mushtaq was the second notable scorer with 26 from 74 
balls with a boundary.
For Sri Lanka, Kumar Dharmasena was the most outstanding bowler with 
three wickets for 16 runs from 10 overs.
Wickremasinghe was responsible for Pakistan s rot when he sent back 
Salim Elahi and Ramiz Raja in his first five overs to finish with the 
figures of 2 for 19 from seven overs.
However, it was skipper Arjuna Ranatunga who won the Man-of-the-Match 
award for his two wickets for Basit Ali and Zafar Iqbal for 21 runs 
>from  10 overs.
The accuracy and tight line and length of the Sri Lankan bowlers can 
be figured out from the fact that Pakistan never achieved a run-rate 
of three runs per over. The closest Pakistan came was 2.96.
Sri Lanka, set only 144 for victory in 50 overs, never found 
themselves uncomfortable against a depressed and demoralised Pakistan 
attack and fielders to reel off the target in 26.5 overs and for the 
loss of only two wickets.
The two not out batsmen were Roshan Mahanama with 47 off 73 balls with 
five fours and Aravinda de Silva on 35 with two sixes and a boundary 
>from  33 balls.
Sanath Jayasuriya, 25 off 23 balls with two fours and a six, and 
Asanka Gurusinha, 31 off 38 balls with three fours, were the two 
batsmen out.

<a name="jrsi">West Indies jrs in sight of victory in Test </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ilyas Beg
FAISALABAD, Oct.18 An excellent all-round performance by the West 
Indies Juniors Mahendra, Nagamootoo brought sight of victory on the 
second day of the first unofficial cricket Test against the Pakistan 
juniors at the Iqbal Stadium here, on Wednesday. When the two umpires 
decided to end the day s play nine minutes before the scheduled time, 
the visitors needed only 91 runs to win with nine wickets in hand.
Two days play remains in this four-day match but it may conclude 
before or a little after the luncheon interval on Thursday.
Buoyed by his best all-round display in the North Telecom Inter State 
Junior competition in the West Indies, Nagamootoo first batted 
intelligently here on Tuesday afternoon and Wednesday morning to hit 
the top score of 40 (studded with four boundaries) for his side and 
later in the day bowled with unbelievable control over length and 
variation of spin flight and pace to send the Pakistan juniors reeling 
for 132 all out in the second innings. He claimed five important 
wickets for 29 runs to not only remove both the Pakistani openers but 
also destroyed the middle-order Pakistan batting. Not only that 
Nagamootoo sent Zubair Ayub back to the pavilion to end all hopes of a 
fight-back by the Pakistani tailenders. Bowling his fast-medium 
deliveries from the far end, Donville McKenzie gave him admirable 
support by accounting for three Pakistan batsmen, conceding 24 runs.
Nagamootoo had claimed three wickets in the first innings and in a 
supporting role with paceman Reon King, who claimed five wickets to 
destroy the Pakistani batting, had helped in restraining home side to 
a paltry score of 116. Nagamootoo claimed eight wickets in this match 
for 63 runs. His all-round display seems to be the most decisive 
factor in the visitors supremacy over the home team in the first of 
the three- Test series currently being played in this country.
The West Indies juniors went on to score 132 in the first innings, 
gaining only 16 runs lead during the process of losing the last three 
wickets. Mohammad Zahid, claimed six wickets for 48 runs. Captain 
Naveed Rana took three wickets for 54 runs.
The Pakistan junior team crashed to 132 all out in the second innings, 
44 minutes after the tea interval. The wicket had eased more and 
whatever little bounce was in evidence on the first day, has now 
disappeared completely. Despite a good start of 65 runs, the Pakistan 
junior side lost quick wickets and offered an easy target to visitors. 
Both the openers batted with action before lunch and opened out in the 
second session to hit some delectable strokes. However, suddenly they 
lost concentration and were out one after the other. None of the 
following batsmen could show the resilience, application and 
concentration. On this pitch, the batsmen have to graft runs. But the 
Pakistanis impetuosity to go for strokes helped Nagamootoo and Clarke 
show their magic .
Needing only 117 runs for victory,. the West Indies junior side scored 
26 for one at the draw of stumps. At the total of 23, opener Wavell 
Hinds went on the backfoot to play a delivery of Captain Naveed Rana 
which kept low, he missed that completely and was adjudged leg for 
wicket by umpire Professor Ikram Rabbani. Hinds could score ten runs. 
The other opener Adrian Murphy (10) and number three batsman shirley 
Clarke (2) will resume the West Indies second innings at 26 for one.
Captain Naveed Rana showed better ability to use the new-ball and was 
rewarded with Hinds wicket. however, he failed to handle his bowling 
resources well as he did not give a chance to any of the three 
spinners on a turning pitch before the close of play. Mohammad Zahid 
did not bowl as well as he had bowled in the morning session or 
Tuesday afternoon.
Captain Gareth Breese showed better qualities of leadership. After a 
few overs from the opening bowlers King and Richards, which the 
Pakistan openers negotiated well, he brought on spinner Nagamootoo. 
Not only that he afforded the opportunity of bowling to off-spinner 
Ryan Hurley. He persisted with the bowling of Clarke from the far end 
and the tall paceman cut and swung the ball appreciably to put the 
Pakistan batsmen in trouble.
The Pakistanis openers took the total in the second innings to 46 at 
the luncheon interval to give a good start to the team. Nagamootoo 
broke Pakistani first wicket partnership by getting Adil Nisar out 
five boundaries in his stay of 93 minutes at the crease. But rush of 
blood saw Adil Nisar offering a catch to Groot at mid-wicket. The 
first Pakistan wicket fell at the total of 65. To make things worse 
for Pakistan team. Fahd Usman (24, scored in 103 minutes offered a 
catch to Nagamootoo in his very next over. The Pakistani second 
innings never recovered from these shocks. The second wicket fell at 
the total of 74.
Shahid Afridi showed the temperament and technique to play on this 
pitch to some extent and contributed 30 useful runs (laced with 5 
boundaries) in 58 minutes. He fell leg before wicket to Hurley to 
offer the off-spinner his only wicket. He was the eight Pakistani 
batsman out at the total of 125. This signalled an end to the hasty 
end of the Pakistani second innings. With his dismissal the hopes of a 
good lead diminished.
Masood Ali (4) could not play an in swinger from McKenzie and fell leg 
before wicket. The third Pakistani wicket fell at 74. Javed Sami 
mistook a googly from Nagamootoo as a leg-break, went on the backfoot 
to play a cut and was bowled. Majid Inayat (9) mistimed a ball from 
McKenzie and offered a simple catch to the bowler, who accepted it 
graciously during his follow-through. Captain Naveed Rana was yorked 
by McKenzie for a duck to offer the pace bowler his third wicket. The 
sixth Pakistani wicket fell at 87.
Top-scorer of Pakistan in the first innings, Zeeshan Pervaiz, snicked 
a sharp delivery from Nagamootoo in the safe hands of wicketkeeper 
Basdeo. Shahid Afridi hit McKenzie for three consecutive boundaries in 
an effort to pull the Pakistan team out of trouble before falling to 
Hurley. His drives were a treat to watch. Salman Fazal (9) fell to a 
brilliant catch by captain Breese in slips off Reon King. Zubair Ayub 
(6) skied a ball from Nagamootoo to give the deceptive leg-spinner his 
fifth scalp. King held a good catch. Two fielders converged towards 
the ball but the fellow-player gave a chance to King to make the 
catch. That marked the end of the Pakistani second innings.
The West Indies junior team could manage a marginal 16 runs lead in 
the first innings despite good batting by its overnight not out 
Mahendra Nagamootoo (40) on the second morning of the first unofficial 
Test at Iqbal Stadium on Wednesday.
The last three West Indies wickets fell with the addition of only 30 
runs in 7.3 overs. The visitors batted for 44 minutes. The Pakistani 
duo of pacemen Mohammad Zahid and Captain Naveed Rana mopped up the 
tail.
Naveed Rana made the breakthrough early when he got the other 
overnight not out Reon King out. The batsman mistimed Naveed Rana s 
third ball of his first over of the morning and Zubair Ayub held a 
simple catch at the short mid-wicket position. The eighth West Indies 
wicket fell with the addition of only one run to the overnight total 
of 102.
Although the Mahendra Nagamootoo showed was the ninth batsman out. 
Mohammad Zahid claimed the last two wickets to wind up the West Indies 
first innings. Mohammad Zahid had been concentrating one generating 
pace, which did not bother the West Indies players on this slow pitch. 
He sent down a slower one which Nagamootoo failed to cope with. he 
offered an easy catch which the bowler accepted with grace during his 
follow through. Nagamootoo top-scored (40) for the visitors. 
Nagamootoo s knock was a mixture of solid defence and aggression. He 
stayed at the crease for 99 minutes, faced 76 balls and hit four 
elegant boundaries. The ninth West Indies wicket fell at the total of 
123. Mohammad Zahid claimed the last visitors wicket when Denville 
McKenzie (4) skied his delivery and wicketkeeper Majid Inayat caught 
the ball quits easily. The West Indies first innings folded at 132.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
LAHORE, Oct 18 Hafiz Salman Butt, Secretary of his own faction of 
Pakistan Football Federation on Wednesday demanded detailed inquiry 
into the disappearance of 13 footballers in Japan.
Addressing a press conference this afternoon, he accused the rival 
body headed by Mian Muhammad Azhar of showing negligence in this 
regard and said the act has brought bad name to the country.
He said under FIFA rules only 25 persons, consisting of 20 players and 
five officials are allowed in a football contingent.
 In this regard Crescent Club, Faisalabad, took 27 persons in complete 
violation of rules, he said.
He alleged that Chaudhry Zakaullah, an official of the rival body, 
accepted Rs.500,000 from persons of Gujranwala, Wazirabad and 
Faisalabad and included them in the Crescent Club and they 
subsequently disappeared in Japan.
The Club had gone to Japan to compete in the Asian Club Championship 
and lost 9-1 to Verdy Kawasaki.
Hafiz Salman Butt also demanded that Pakistan Sports Board should 
investigate into whole matter and ascertain why so many persons were 
cleared to proceed to Japan.
He said the names of the 27 persons who accompanied the squad should 
also be released so that it could be known how many were genuine 
players and officials.
