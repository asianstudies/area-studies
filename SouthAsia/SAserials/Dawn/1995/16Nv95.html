<a name="alta">Altaf flays police action against Press</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Nov 10 Mohajir Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussain has in a 
statement condemned the actions of the Police in Karachi to browbeat 
journalists and curb their reporting activities.
Mr Hussain said the threats to gag the Press, in a country like 
Pakistan were ominous when the police seemed to be indulging in the 
worst kind of barbarities against those it considers to be opponents 
of the PPP Government.

The threats were aimed at stopping the Press from telling the public 
the high-handed criminal actions of the police, such as torturing of 
people in their custody or of extrajudicial murders which are 
routinely shown as fake encounters in official documents .
He hoped that the Press will continue to perform its national task of 
reporting the police excesses boldly.
In another statement, Mr Hussain has appealed for financial help for 
the families of detained MQM workers and those who are in jail by 
sending medical supplies and food stuff for them to the MQM in Karachi 
or Hyderabad.

<a name="mqms">MQM seeks donations</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov 11 MQM chief Altaf Hussain has urged philanthropists and 
the public in general to help thousands of party workers languishing 
in jails.
In a two-page donation appeal, Altaf Hussain said thousands of his 
party workers were passing a miserable life in prisons in the 
interior of Sindh as their families were unable to help them owing to 
 the high cost of transportation and bribes being demanded by the 
prison staff .
He claimed the prison staff was demanding Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 from each 
family to allow them to see their dear and near ones in various 
prisons in the province.
The MQM, he said, was facing an acute shortage of funds owing to the 
operation clean-up against it for the last over three-and-a-half years 
and an unofficial ban on its activities.
He urged the philanthropists and the public to donate medicines, rice, 
pulses, sugar, ghee, soaps, tooth paste, and other day-to-day items.

<a name="flay">Altaf flays killing of MQM worker</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Nov 11 The government is making false claims that it is 
serious about conciliation and negotiations but it believes only in 
the use of force which it is employing against the Mohajirs , said the 
MQM leader, Mr Altaf Hussain, who was condoling the death of his party 
worker, Waheed in Orangi. Mr Hussain accused the PPP gunmen of having 
brutally murdered him.
He said that if the government failed to arrest the killers, who, 
according to him are known PPP workers, the MQM would have no option 
but to use the weapon of protest.
He said while the government ministers express their support for talks 
and claim they are anxious to resolve issues through negotiations, the 
ruling party itself is involved in the killing of MQM workers under 
the patronage of the Rangers and the police in Orangi Town area.

Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov 12 MQM chief Altaf Hussain on Sunday gave a week s 
deadline to the government to stop operation against Mohajirs saying 
it was a pre-requisite for holding of meaningful talks with the MQM.

government was misleading the people to believe that it wanted to 
solve problems through dialogue.
Mr Hussain mentioned that the government has withdrawn police force on 
guard duty of members of MQM negotiating team and instituted fake 
criminal cases against them .
During the ninth round of talks, he said, the government had agreed 
that it would shift detainees to Karachi and Hyderabad jails from the 
remote prisons in Sindh, but it did not act accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Nov. 15 Mohajir Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussain has 
condemned the killing of his party supporter Mohammad Anwar Qureshi, 
allegedly by the Haqiqi group gunmen.
He said these people raided a house in Federal B Area to abduct Asif 
Ali, an MQM worker. Not finding him there, they then took away 
Mohammad Anwar to their notorious torture cell in Liaquatabad.
Mr Hussain said that Mohammad Anwar s father went to the authorities 
who told him his whereabouts but refused to rescue him from the hold 
of the Haqiqi group.
This murder, he added, is a clear proof of a collusion between the 
present government and the Haqiqi terrorists.
Mr Hussain also urged the president to take necessary steps to stop 
the Haqiqi group from killing Mohajirs.

the survival of democracy and of the country to mid-term elections and 
said he was all for consensus on key issues including reforms in the 
Constitution.

prior to mid-term polls he said a national commission should be set up 
having judges who will be permanently on it. The commission should 
investigate all cases of corruption and those found guilty be 
punished.
 Horse trading in any form should be banned and if any legislator 
changes party loyalty, he ceases to be a member of the House , he 
said.
The prestige of judiciary be restored by removing all Jiala judges 
and all appointments be made strictly on merit basis only, he 
demanded.

matters like the Kashmir, Afghanistan and nuclear issues.
Another important problem which he said also called for a consensus 
was the need for restoring peace in Karachi as all economic progress 
is depended on peace in the metropolis. 
The former prime minister said all such key issues along with the

-------------------------------------------------------------------

about their horses worth Rs900 million as well as construction of 
their palaces abroad.

investments and banks depleted. He alleged that all foreign tours were 
undertaken only for luxury and only for taking jiyalas on excursions.

and he felt ashamed of even taking names of those whom Benazir took 
with her in the name of culture.
The leader of the opposition said there was no need to give any call

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 13 Pakistan Muslim League, commenting on Interior 
Minister Naseerullah Babar s remarks against the arrested leader of 
the Opposition, Mian Shahbaz Sharif, termed it totally devoid of all 
norms of decency, civility and an expression of political bankruptcy.
The PML spokesman said the attempt to fabricate a case had failed one 
year ago and it would meet the same fate now since the interior 
minister was merely repeating old lies. He said had there been even 
an iota of truth in these documents, the government would not have 
waited for one year to reissue these but, instead, would have 
presented them in a court of law.
He also said these documents had no legal veracity as was evident from 
the fact that they were being used only to satisfy the interior 
minister s desire for pursuing a trial of Mian Shahbaz Sharif through 
the press on baseless allegations.
Concluding, the PML spokesman advised the interior minister to have 
mercy on himself and spend his last days praying to the Almighty for 
forgiveness and atonement for the many sins and crimes that he had 
committed while in office all across the country, the latest being the 
arrest of an innocent man on false charges.

<a name="shah">Shahbaz rebuts Babar s claim on loan issue</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 15 Shahbaz Sharif said here on Wednesday that Ittefaq 
Group of Industries owed Rs3.0 billion to the banks and not Rs6.0 
billion as claimed by Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar.
PBC urged to probe Advocate involved in abortive attack on Asma
Terming Babar s claims worst example of vilification, victimisation 
and distortion of facts, he said his news conference was full of 
inaccuracies, false allegations and politically-motivated accusations.
Giving a history of Ittefaq group established by his father in 1939, 
Shahbaz Sharif dispelled the impression that the Ittefaq Group 
expanded from one unit to 20 units in 10 years period when Nawaz 
Sharif was holding the office of the chief minister and the prime 
minister.
LOAN DEFAULTS Shahbaz Sharif said while less than Rs3.0 billion were 
taken as loan by his family s industrial concerns, these loans were 
secured by assets at least thrice the amount of the loan. He also 
claimed that all these loans were taken against proper security and 
serviced on time. Till October 1993, he said, none of the Ittefaq 
units were loan defaulters.
He said if there would have been any outstanding loan against him or 
his two brothers, they would have been debarred from contesting the 
last general elections.
Shahbaz Sharif said the Ittefaq Foundries were forced to close after 
the government asked the banks not to open letters of credit for the 
import of raw materials for their industrial units.
TAXES The opposition leader in the Punjab assembly said Sharif family 
paid a total wealth tax of Rs one million during 1992-93. He said the 
wealth tax was adjusted in the total taxable income. Hence the income 
tax was reduced.
Regarding bank loans sought from Citi bank, he said these were secured 
against the US dollar account of Kashif Masood Qazi and Sikandara 
Qazi.
He denied that the loans were excessive and said the interior minister 
should compare the loans of the Ittefaq group with loans obtained by 
other similar industrial units in Pakistan.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov 8 Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar claimed on 
Wednesday that Altaf Group activists were facing paucity of funds 
and ammunition.
The Interior Minister, said long-term settlement is possible only 
through political dialogue. Claiming that some elements within the MQM 
had started questioning Altaf Hussain s policy of confrontation, he 
said eyebrows are being raised over the luxurious lifestyle of Altaf 
Hussain. Whatever funds MQM activists collected through donations and 
other means have been sent to London and party activists here are 
short of funds. 
The people who had suffered for him, he said, were in financial 
difficulties. The families of those who had gone to jail for his cause 
had now started demanding financial assistance from the party.
He claimed that some of the arrested MQM activists had disclosed that 
they had also committed dacoities to raise funds for operations. 
He asked Mr Altaf Hussain to come back to Pakistan to prove himself 
like those leaders who were with their men when they were faced with 
hardships.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov 10 The chief government negotiator, Federal Law Minister 
N.D. Khan, called on the chief MQM negotiator, Ajmal Dehlavi, on 
Friday, in a bid to seek resumption of the stalled talks which the MQM 
say depends on a positive reply to its letter by the government.
Talking to newsmen after about 50 minutes of one-to-one talks with Mr 
Dehlavi, Mr Khan said he was very hopeful about the early resumption 
of talks which have been stalled since Sept 24.
Appreciating Mr Dehlavi s concern for peace and tranquillity in the 
city and the need for breaking the present impasse, Mr Khan said the 
talks could be resumed around Nov 20 or even before.
The law minister said that it would depend on Mr Dehlavi s own plan to 
visit London and return of his two colleagues from there.
Giving his side of the story, chief MQM negotiator, Mr Dehlavi 
reiterated his party s position that talks could be resumed any day 
once the government furnished a positive reply to his letter.
Emphasising the need for a meaningful and substantive negotiations to 
resolve the issues politically, Mr Dehlavi made it clear that bullets 
and abuses must stop. 
Mr Dehlavi complained that the government had not fulfilled any of its 
commitments. None of the 10 points on which an agreement was signed 
by the Sindh government on Oct 19 last year, have been implemented so 
far.
He said the government has failed to fulfil its promises about the 
release of Shazia Farooq, meeting with Qamar Mansoor and other 
interned MPAs.
 Given this situation there is hardly any chance for the success of 
the talks, said the chief MQM negotiator.

<a name="govt">Govt promised nothing to MQM during talks Khan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 14 Federal Minister For Law, Justice and 
Parliamentary Affairs, N.D. Khan has said that the talks between 
government and the MQM was unconditional and nothing was committed by 
the government during the nine rounds of negotiations.
N.D. Khan said that he was very optimistic about resumption of talks 
between government and the MQM after meeting Mr Ajmal Dehlavi but he 
was surprised to see the next day s newspapers carrying the news 
regarding MQM demands and a dead line was announced to meet these 
demands, he added.
It was really shocking for him that rather coming to the table within 
seven days as was promised by Ajmal Dehlavi, next day seven rocket 
launchers were fired at the Police Headquarters by the terrorists, the 
minister said.
Mr Khan hoped that the issue of Karachi would be resolved within one 
week after resumption of talks, I hope that the positive response 
will come from the other side and we will be able to resolve this 
issue in the coming days .

In this context he referred to MQM chief Altaf Hussain s statement in 
which he has given the government seven days to honour its commitments 
to the MQM negotiating team and engage in sincere and serious 
negotiations by stopping state terrorism. He also pointed out that Mr 
Hussain has asked for guarantees against extrajudicial killings of 
MQM activists.
Asked if MQM had entered into any formal alliance with the PML and the 
ANP, Mr Dehlavi said We have political understanding and if they 
decide on launching a movement against the government, and we are 
asked to participate, we may consider it if we find the programme in 
conformity with our objectives.

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 13 Interior Minister Naseeruallah Babar said I have 
been informed by the intelligence agencies that a squad of MQM 
terrorists has come to Islamabad to assassinate me. But I am least 
bothered because it is my firm belief that when it is my turn (to die) 
no power on earth can save me. 
Babar said he had even been moving in the violent-hit city of Karachi 
without any police squad as he was not afraid of death. He went on 
further to say I am the only stumbling block in their (MQM) way so 
they want to eliminate me but I am not afraid .

<a name="shar">Sharif s family secured Rs6.14bn loans Babar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 13 Family of Opposition Leader Nawaz Sharif secured 
loans to the tune of Rs6.14 billion since 1983, Interior Minister 
Naseerullah Babar claimed on Monday.
The interior minister said Sharif family had laundered its black 
money by bringing money from abroad in fake bank accounts which were 
being operated by their people.
He said the opposition leader was trying to create an impression that 
the arrest of his younger brother, Shahbaz Sharif, was the result of 
political victimisation, whereas the fact was that he (Shahbaz Sharif) 
was involved in financial frauds to the tune of millions of rupees. 
He also provided documentary evidence to reporters to establish his 
claim.
He said the family had a one unit industrial empire in 1980 but when 
Sharif became the chief minister the number of these mills grew to 
nine. This number of industries swelled to 20 when Mian Nawaz Sharif 
became the prime minister.
Babar said despite the rapid increase in their industrial units, they 
wilfully and fraudulently concealed their wealth and income and 
submitted false income tax statements. He said in 1992-93 Shahbaz paid 
Rs897 as income tax and in 1993-94, Rs 47,450.
He said on the basis of this declared income it was not possible to 
set up even a single more unit. Obviously it was arranged through 
most corrupt, unlawful and illegal means and misuse of official 
position by pressuring the banks. 
The interior minister said the government was approaching the United 
States government for registration of a case in that country against 
Sharif family for transferring huge amounts of money through wire 
transaction in violation of US laws.

<a name="prob">Probe team recommends court martial of armymen</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtasham ul Haque
ISLAMABAD, Nov 11 A high level team of army experts, undertaking an 
inquiry into the conduct of some army officers, has concluded that a 
group of senior officers tried to stage a coup on Sept 26 by planning 
to eliminate nine corps commanders and four principal staff officers 
in the General Headquarters (GHQ) and has recommended their court 
martial.
Informed sources told Dawn here on Saturday that a communication was 
also delivered to all the lieutenant generals by the director-general 
of Military Intelligence (MI), Lt Gen Mehmood ,informing them that a 
conspiracy had been hatched to storm into the corps commanders meeting 
on Sept 26 and capture power.
 Blueprints of the planned coup along with video and audio cassettes 
have been recovered which were to be broadcast and telecast on state-
run radio and television after elimination of all the nine corps 
commanders and four principal staff officers and claiming that a true 
Islamic revolution has come in Pakistan, a source said. The four 
PSO s are Quarter Master General (QMG), Chief of the General Staff 
(CGS), Adjutant General (AG) and Master General of Ordinance (MGO).
A one-page communication circulated by the director-general MI also 
said that there were two groups in the arrested army officers. One 
belonged to the inner circle which was to conduct the operation while 
the other was asked to be ready for any instant assignment.
Sources said those who were involved only in extending verbal support 
to what they called Jihad in the occupied Kashmir were likely to be 
released soon. However, those who had established contact with Harkat-
ul-Ansar of the occupied Kashmir and were providing them arms and 
ammunition by smuggling them from Darra Adam Khel in NWFP and some 
parts of Afghanistan will have to undergo stringent investigations if 
not a court martial.
There were about 40 officers including Maj Gen Zaheer-ul-Islam Abbasi, 
and Brig Mustansar Billah who were arrested on Sept 26 on being tipped 
by former chief of the MI, Maj Gen Ali Quli Khan, who was latter 
promoted to the rank of Lt Gen. Sources said more arrests were likely 
after completion of further investigation which was being undertaken 
now.
Sources added that the MI chief also said in his communication that 
there was a wave of sectarianism and extremism in Pakistan which has 
to be curbed to save the country. This is a dangerous trend and could 
tear apart the whole fabric of the society if not timely checked, he 
further reportedly stated.
Sources said that the Army chief, General Abdul Waheed, is expected to 
call on President Farooq Leghari who is also the Supreme Commander on 
his return from New Zealand to discuss the matter.

<a name="hrcp">HRCP voices concern at police torture</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report 
LAHORE, Nov 8 The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has strongly 
protested against the reported increase in cases of torture by police 
during investigation and demanded that immediate measures should be 
taken to civilise the police force . Members of the assemblies and 
public opinion, it said, should join in demanding a monitoring and 
accounting of police conduct.
In a statement, HRCP chairperson Asma Jahangir said that reports in a 
section of the Press about police torture made a harrowing reading . 
The worst imaginable third- degree methods had become part of the 
standard armoury of almost every police station in Punjab , she 
observed.
Ms Asma Jahangir said it appeared that virtually every police station 
maintained a separate unofficial torture cell, and the situation in 
villages was even more gruesome because terrorism is open . She said 
that most of people taken into custody were believed to be routinely 
subjected to extremes of violence. Many die and then they are 
reported killed while trying to escape , she stated.
The HRCP chief referred to another report, according to which the 
Lahore High Court was stated to have taken serious notice of the fact 
that the law against keeping women detainees in police stations 
overnight was being widely violated.
Ms Asma Jahangir said this was a deplorable state of affairs and added 
that no society, even remotely civilised, should stand for it.

of the Supreme Court, was behind the abortive attempt on the lives of 
the Jilani sisters (Asma and Hina Jilani) and members of their family. 
Ms Asma and other lawyers deplored that only two of some eight 
attackers have been arrested so far. She and her colleagues are not 
satisfied with the investigations. They said it is evident from the 
elaborate preparations of and the recoveries made from the accused 
that it was not an ordinary crime. An organised group is behind the 
conspiracy to eliminate liberal elements, they said.

<a name="rema">Remark brings NA proceeding to a halt</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Nov 8 The proceedings of the National Assembly were 
brought to a grinding halt on Wednesday by an infuriated Zafar Ali 
Shah who demanded a house apology from his own treasury colleague, 
Nawabzada Ghazanfur Gul.
The desired apology never came from an equally worked up Nawabzada but 
a good hour and half of the proceedings were lost to the stand-off 
which was ultimately resolved after a heated debate in the deputy 
speaker s chamber.
It all started with a seemingly innocent innuendo hurled at Maulana 
Abdur Raheem Chitrali during the question hour, by the ever-joking 
Nawabzada Gul. The Nawabzada was immediately rewarded with the typical 
opposition reaction of replying in a similar language and the 
hurtling of equally barbed innuendoes and nothing seemed extraordinary 
by the accepted standards of behaviour in the House. Only no one 
seemed to have accounted for the mercurial temper of the deputy 
speaker who immediately branded Nawabzada s remarks as obscene and 
demanded an apology from him.
After a little dilly dallying and lacing his statement with a few 
ambiguities, Nawabzada finally apologised to Maulana Chitrali but 
apparently he didn t do it fast enough for Zafar s pleasure who 
immediately put forth the additional command of Gul apologising to the 
entire House. This time it was Nawabzada s turn to throw up his hands 
in anger and declare no way . Gul insisted that he had not said 
anything obscene while Zafar interpreted his statement as such. The 
deadlock had begun.
After repeating his directive a few times, a clearly flustered looking 
Zafar Ali Shah adjourned the House and retreated to his chambers with 
different government ministers scurrying to his office.
Initially, the deputy speaker was placated by the ever effusive 
Khurshid Ali Shah who said that Nawabzada had already left the House 
and would therefore miss out the remaining part of the proceedings. 
But before a relatively complacent Zafar Ali Shah could return to the 
House, a furious sounding Nawabzada popped into his office and the 
whole debate began anew.
Had it not been for the presence of Khawaja Asif, Akbar Vance, a 
couple of journalists and federal ministers Raza Rabbani and Sher 
Afgan, the matters could have easily taken a turn for the worse with 
Nawabzada threatening to resign rather than apologise for a wrong he 
never committed and an equally determined Shah refusing to budge.
After a heated exchange of a good 30 minutes or so both men left the 
deputy speaker s chamber without reaching any final agreement. 
Nawabzada went out grumbling on the arm of Raza Rabbani while an 
equally irate Zafar donned his black robe and sauntered towards the 
House reiterating his determination to elicit an apology from Gul . 
In the chamber he went even as far as suggesting that in the absence 
of this apology he would not go back . When one of the journalists 
present suggested that he may be making it an unnecessary matter of 
ego, a seemingly offended Shah retorted Maybe I am at fault because I 
still go by the values we learnt in the 60 s .
Nawabzada, ministers and the journalists gathered in the deputy 
speaker s chambers returned to the House without the slightest clue 
about Zafar Ali Shah s immediate future action. Once inside, the 
deputy speaker made a solemn assessment of the stand off forcing a 
nervous sounding Khurshid Ali Shah to insist upon an opportunity to 
say a few words before you give any ruling .
Once again Shah reiterated that Gul would apologise to Maulana 
Chitrali, tactfully avoiding any mention of the apology to the House 
as demanded by Zafar Ali Shah. At this point Nawabzada stood up and 
made an almost brief speech under the pretext of apologising to the 
Maulana who too accepted the apology in an equally graceful manner. 
Sensing that both the opposition and the treasury weren t interested 
in taking up this issue any further, the deputy speaker also let go of 
his demand and took up the next item on the agenda.

<a name="fiaa"fIA asked to arrest tax evaders</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaukat Ali
LAHORE, Nov 10 The federal government has ordered the Federal 
Investigation Agency (FIA) to work in close association with the 
Central Board of Revenue (CBR) in marking cases of gross tax evasion 
irrespective of political or other considerations.
Well informed sources told Dawn here on Friday that Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto had told top brass of her party not to influence the 
FIA staff working to apprehend tax evaders in any manner. The prime 
minister, sources said, had in fact ordered her close aides to draw up 
all possible measures to boost tax revenue to meet International 
Monetary Fund conditionalities if Pakistan had to seek foreign 
assistance against some of its long stuck up projects of national 
interest.
 As a matter of fact the FIA has marked, and confiscated certain 
documents, as many as eleven cases so for involving tax evasion 
amounting to over Rs850 million in Punjab and Sindh, official sources 
said.
If the revenue collection target, they said, for the second quarter 
was also met, or showed upward trend, the government believed that it 
would be in a strong position to negotiate with some foreign financial 
institutions, including the IMF, to fund some important mega projects, 
signed with foreign investors specially in the power sector.

Ghulam Hasnain
KARACHI, Nov. 13 At least 10 people, including a six-month- old girl, 
were wounded and several houses were damaged when unidentified youths 
fired 10 anti-tank rockets at the residential quarters of police in 
Garden on Monday noon.
Seven of the rockets slammed policemen s houses, injuring two 
policemen, three women, two girls and three teenagers. The eighth one 
hit an under-construction building of the police department. Two 
rockets did not explode. One of it fell in the drawing room of an 
Income Tax officer in the same vicinity. The other in an open place.
The attack was followed by heavy shooting by the youths and some of 
the armed residents of the police colony. The heavy shooting continued 
for about 15 to 20 minutes filling the congested neighbourhood with 
gunfire smoke.
The incident heightened tension between over 10,000 residents of 
police quarters and the neighbouring MQM supporters.
Police accused the MQM of launching the rocket attack and said one of 
the fleeing attackers was killed in an encounter. The victim was 
identified as Anwar Khan.
A massive city-wide hunt has also been launched on the basis of a 
diary found on Anwar s body. It was carrying telephone numbers and 
addresses of party activists. At the filing of this report, police 
were raiding suspected houses.

Parts of Clifton reverberated with heavy gunfire when unidentified men 
riding at least four cars resorted to drive-by shooting which, 
neighbours claimed, continued for at least 10 minutes.
The response of the police and other law enforcement agencies was poor 
despite the fact that at least two police stations and the offices of 
Intelligence Bureau, from where the entire city is being monitored, 
are a walking distance from the site of the incident.
Provincial vice-president of PPP (Shaheed Bhutto) Ali Mohammad,

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick 
ISLAMABAD, Nov 8 The audit report 1992-93 of the Defence Services, 
issued by the Auditor General s office on Wednesday, has discovered 
628 cases of financial irregularities and overpayments causing the 
national exchequer losses in excess of Rs 2.9 billion.
This colossal figure is expected to climb even higher because the 
present report only includes the irregularities of serious nature 
having financial effect of Rs 247.427 million and US $ 2.054 million 
while the remaining observations will be dealt with in the 
Memorandum for Departmental Accounts Committee (MFDAC) report.
The Auditor General s report makes some interesting disclosures, 
ranging from outright acts of individual corruption to gross examples 
of departmental negligence in monitoring their fiscal affairs. The 
Defence Production Division has been the biggest contributor to this 
fiscal mayhem by piling up losses to the tune of Rs 95.786 million, 
US$ 1.748 million and Japanese Yen 1.134 million.
According to the report, losses running into hundreds of thousands of 
dollars have been incurred due to awarding of contracts in clear 
violation of laid down procedures.
Irregularities in the affairs of the cantonment boards have also added 
Rs 41.668 million to the overall losses. The irregularities in the 
boards affairs have a greater hue of corruption than official 
negligence.

KARACHI, Nov 8 Stocks failed to sustain the mid-week rally on 
Wednesday as investors took profits at the available margins owing to 
a long weekend ahead.
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100 shares fell 15.06 percent at 
1,534.76 as compared to 1,549.82 a day earlier, while all share index 
suffered a decline of 8.23 points at 862.27 as against previous 
870.60.
The market capitalisation, which has risen to Rs 337 billion on 
Tuesday, therefore, fell to Rs 333.730 billion, showing a decline of 
Rs 3.225 billion in a single session.
The opening was a bit higher partly because of the extension of the 
overnight run-up but after mid-session investors rushed in to 
liquidate positions, pushing the market again into the minus column.
Selective buying, however, emerged strong on a number of counters 
lifting prices substantially higher under the lead of Parke-Davis, 
which rose by another Rs 11 on a turnover of 500 shares. Some of the 
investors seemed to sell in part to cash in on the higher levels.
However, there is no possibility of a reaction in its share value as 
there is shortage of floating stock.
Grays of Cambridge followed it for an identical reasons and was quoted 
higher by Rs 10 and so did Pakistan Refinery after the overnight 
slashing.
Other big gainers were led by Orix Leasing, Lease Pakistan, Adamjee 
Insurance, National Refinery, Dandot Cement, Pakistan Gum Engro 
Chemicals and Rupali Polyester, which posted gains ranging from one 
rupee to Rs 3.
KASB & Co, Shafiq Textiles, Glaxo Lab and Lever Brothers were among 
the top losers falling by Rs 5 to 15 but the fall reflected lack of 
support rather than large selling.
They were followed by leading shares such as Bank al-Habib, Citicorp, 
Sapphire Fabrics, Cherat Cement, PSO, Dewan Salman, Shell Pakistan and 
Engro Chemicals, falling by one rupee to Rs 3. The news that the 
directors of Indus Motors have passed over the dividend for the last 
year ended June 30, 1995 was not well-received in the rings as was 
reflected by a fall in its share value.
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, which came in for active 
profit-taking at the higher levels, off 80 paisa on 2.513 million 
shares followed by PTC vouchers, lower 95 paisa on 2.315 million 
shares, Dewan Salman, down one rupee on 1.178 million shares, and Dhan 
Fibre, easy 35 paisa on 881,200 shares.
Other actively traded shares were led Faysal Bank, lower 20 paisa on 
386,400 shares, Ibrahim Fibre, easy 25 paisa on 353,500 shares 25th 
ICP, up 10 paisa on 275,500 shares, Dawood Leasing, up 40 paisa on 
273,900 shares and Honda-Atlas, off 75 paisa on 159,500 shares.
Trading volume rose to 11.784 million shares from the previous 9.898 
million shares owing to heavy selling in the current favourites.
There were 370 actively traded shares, out of which 21 shares suffered 
decline, while 73 rose, with 85 holding on to the last levels.

haste to buy the new series of prize bonds bearing denomination of Rs 
25,000.
According to State Bank sources, apart from the first prize of Rs 25 
million, the bonds carry five second prizes of Rs 2.5 million each and 
20 prizes of Rs 1.250 million.
The Government has introduced the scheme to squeeze like idle savings 
and bring them under its control, said a banker. However it is

of commercial banks who may lose deposits of a considerable amount.

<a name="nowa">No way out?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Rifaat Hamid Ghani
THE mass murder of fifteen labourers, viewed through the prism of 
Karachi, becomes meat for politicised debate, arguments, deductions, 
inferences...
Some interpret it in a way even more chilling than the deed itself. 
They see it as a ploy by anti-MQM factions to alienate the Punjabis 
from  the Mohajirs. The murder also places the PML(N) and its leader, 
who has often played upon the theme of Punjabi sentiment to his own 
advantage, rather neatly on the horns of a dilemma should he alienate 
Punjabi sentiment by not shedding as many tears as some others, or 
should he put a rather good working equation with Altaf Hussain s MQM 
at risk by condemning Mohajir murderers like other politicians, while 
distributing compensatory cheques to bereaved Punjabis?
The news of the massacre broke to the accompaniment of General Babar s 
naming of the MQM as being responsible for it. He may well prove 
himself to be right. Yet, if the indictment had not been as hasty as 
it was, it would have been more convincing to start with. As it is, 
blaming the MQM just seems a habit. After all, how can he know for 
sure right away unless they were caught red-handed? And if they were 
seen fleeing the scene, what happened to the dictum of shoot-on-sight? 
But such doubting Johnnies forget the surviving witness the 
professional terrorists overlooked, even though the mayhem seems to 
have been carried out at undisturbed leisure.
A few days after the deed, and we all seem to be exactly where we were 
before, except that the death toll continues to mount, and the 
polarisation as to what constitutes terror and terrorism is more 
acute.
The government itself propounds a conspiracy theory in explanation 
of the downslide in Karachi.
Does the theory have it that subversive elements have infiltrated the 
MQM activist cadres with or without the connivance of the MQM s 
leadership? Is Altaf Hussain really a leader who himself is a puppet 
in the hands of foreign manipulators or conspirators? If so, they have 
made far too good a job of foisting him on people and putting him in 
place. The MQM has its rightful place in politics, and the major 
national political parties have variously interacted with it 
supportively and endorsed it. However Altaf Hussain may have begun his 
career, at the moment he is a leader whose party is legitimised, 
dejure and de facto, by the reality of its democratic constituency and 
following. And that is the perspective in which he and his following 
must be judged.
National leadership cannot be seen in the perspective of a conspiracy 
theory. But it would be a pity if leadership is so short-sighted that 
its actions become manna from heaven for elements that may wish to see 
the country weakened, kept at a conveniently manageable level of 
turbulence, or Karachi itself eventually isolated or placed, like a 
naughty juvenile, in a ward of special care.
The dialogue between the teams led by the Editor of Amn and the 
academically undistinguished professor who serves as federal minister 
for law may be treated by the participants as of weighty import. But 
it does not rivet public interest any longer and seems as moribund as 
other approaches.
Paradoxically, it is Altaf Hussain who can take the initiative in 
breaking the deadlock. The government may have the advantage of 
wielding the awesome might of the state, but this advantage, when the 
exercise of it is too prolonged, becomes counter- productive. In a 
democratic context, it is self-defeating. But the government cannot 
survive if it is seen to be backing down before violent defiance.
Mr Hussain can get away with his policy of days of mourning and 
strikes. Victimisation of his constituency has invested him with 
unquestionable authority to decide what is good for the community and 
what is not. Rather than presiding over a battle unto death between 
factions, some armed activists, and the law enforcement agencies, 
Altaf Hussain could call upon his devoted following for a unilateral 
end to violence. It would absolve him of much that may have gone 
before, and give his cause considerable moral strength.
The fact is, whether there are all that many MQM activists or not 
wielding kalashnikovs among other anti-social elements or political 
activists ruining the peace of mind of Karachi s populace, MQM party 
rhetoric and language is couched in extreme terms and steeped in 
violence. True, the MQM is offered inexcusable provocation constantly, 
but a statesmanlike approach will find the wisdom to turn away from 
provocation so that it boomerangs on the practitioners of provocation.

<a name="audi">Audit and accountability</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mazdak
FOR every government that comes along, whether civilian or military, 
accountability is a shiny new weapon to use against its predecessors. 
With the energy, glee and occasional malice of boisterous, badly 
brought up children, successive rulers have unleashed a selective 
process against those who were in power before them.
What all these politicians overlook is the fact that there is already 
a well-established system of accountability written into the 
constitution and which has, due to lack of support and ignorance, 
fallen into disuse. The Public Accounts Committee is, in all 
parliamentary democracies, the most powerful and feared committee of 
the assembly. It scrutinises annual accounts and audit reports of 
every department and public sector enterprise and passes strictures 
and directives aimed at plugging the leaks in the public exchequer. It 
can recommend disciplinary action and/or recovery of pilfered funds. 
In France, Belgium and Turkey, the equivalent institution is the Court 
of Accounts whose president has judicial powers.
In the United Kingdom, where this institution was born, a prominent 
member of the opposition is traditionally chairman of the PAC. 
However, our democratic system has a long way to travel before we 
attain this level of maturity. But even with a member of the ruling 
party heading it, governments are reluctant to give the PAC a free 
hand. For instance, it has taken this government two full years to 
convene a meeting of the PAC so that the chairman could be elected. 
The good news is that the Committee plans to meet regularly and often 
so that the huge backlog that has accumulated can be cleared.
Before the Assembly was dissolved in 1993, the previous PAC was going 
through the audit reports for 1987-88, and the new Committee will have 
to complete the task of scrutinising seven- year old accounts when it 
first meets on November 19. Most of the Secretaries concerned as the 
Principal Accounting Officers of their respective divisions have been 
transferred or have retired. Some of the officers identified in the 
audit reports as having been responsible for misappropriation are now 
OSDs in the great Secretariat in the Sky. Consequently, when the PAC 
wades through these old reports, it will be going through the motions, 
unable to do very much about the losses detailed in the audit reports 
beyond issuing dire warnings to officials who were not on the scene 
when these particular scams took place.
And remember, this is only the tip of the iceberg typically, the 
Auditor-General s reports are based on a scrutiny of only 10% of the 
transactions in the organisations his team audit. Nevertheless, they 
contain a plethora of information about waste and leakage. If our 
leaders were ever serious about real accountability, this is where 
they would have started, instead of setting up all kinds of anti-
corruption committees and commissions which never end up achieving 
very much excepting to hog newspaper space. The seriousness successive 
governments have assigned to the audit function can be judged by the 
fact that the provincial PAC in Sindh has not met in ten years. As far 
as I know, the Balochistan PAC has never met. But in Punjab and the 
NWFP, the Committees have been meeting regularly.
By being forever in arrears, the whole point of the exercise is lost. 
Officers in the dock know only too well that they are not directly 
responsible for the misdeeds of their predecessors, and by the time 
their own bungling comes to light years later, they will either have 
moved on to greener pastures, or retired with their pension and 
illegally amassed loot intact. Fortunately, this PAC has sensibly 
decided to tackle the old reports and the ones for 1993-94 in quick 
succession. There may be a case for devoting very little time to the 
reports from the Eighties, and concentrating on the more recent ones.
In assisting the PAC, the Auditor-General plays a key role. Apart from 
compiling detailed reports for the federal and provincial governments, 
he and his team brief members about the nature and extent of losses 
suffered by the exchequer. In effect, he acts as the prosecutor while 
the secretary concerned is the accused. It would raise the level of 
public debate if the Press analysed the information contained in the 
audit reports more intelligently, instead of simply playing up juicy 
bits about defalcation and fraud.
For instance, the summary of the Audit Report (1993-94) in respect of 
public enterprises informs me that all federal government-controlled 
corporations (minus WAPDA and the Railways) suffered losses of Rs 2772 
million and made profits of Rs 23107 million in the year under review. 
Thus, totally at odds with popular perception, profits were ten times 
the size of losses in the public sector. Even when highlighting 
financial wrongdoing, the Press would be doing us all a favour if 
reporters were to identify the officials associated with the scams. 
Traditionally, the audit reports do not name officers, although the 
Auditor-General has the information at hand should members of the PAC 
ask for it. Unfortunately, very few reporters take the trouble to do 
the legwork required to dig up such details, but simply reproduce 
sensational sections from these reports which, incidentally, become 
public documents as soon as they are laid before the assembly.
The independence of the Auditor-General is theoretically ensured by 
giving him a fixed five-year tenure. However, by making him and his 
organisation dependent on the Finance Minister for every penny, this 
freedom is effectively and severely curtailed. There is a strong 
argument for attaching him with the National Assembly as he is an 
officer of that body. In addition, he should be given certain judicial 
powers to ensure compliance in the Audit Report for 1993-94 in 
respect of public sector enterprises, for instance, 57 organisations 
did not submit their audited accounts in time, and 8 refused to 
 entertain audit. If the Auditor General could issue contempt 
notices, I am sure there would have been far more cooperation.

<a name="thed">The dictates of reason</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Abdullah J. Memon
According to their perceptions, Mohajirs today are engaged in a life-
and-death struggle to defend their cultural identity and to ward off 
threats to economic privileges (according to them, rights) which 
history conferred upon them. 
While dealing with a community in that state of mind, you have to 
display compassion, sensitivity and understanding. Statesmen do not 
play clever tricks in that kind of situation. But that is precisely 
what the government has been doing.
Again, a seasoned, and often prosecuted, politician like Benazir 
should readily recognise that Mohajirs have achieved their present 
unprecedented political unity, social cohesiveness and organisational 
effectiveness after paying (and exacting) a heavy price in blood and 
tears. They should not be expected to surrender these precious gains 
in the face of administrative manipulation or political manoeuvrings. 
But that is the expectation on which present government strategy seems 
to rest.
As a proven political fighter, Benazir should feel it in her bones 
that Mohajirs know the true value of their assets and are going to 
guard and protect them at any cost. There is, therefore, no escape 
from  conceding to the MQM its place on the political stage. But 
acceptance of the MQM does not mean condonation of its wrongs or 
weaknesses. While giving them their political due, they must be 
persuaded, and if necessary forced to follow the rules of the game.
When you attain certain heights of mass leadership, the hearts of your 
followers beat in unison with yours. Those in politics know and 
understand the poetry and power of this relationship. Today, there is 
an emotional, almost spiritual, nexus between Altaf Hussain and the 
Mohajir masses. (This, by no means, implies that Altaf Hussain has 
become a paragon of piety and purity. Wires of emotions are generally 
not connected with such virtues).
Accusations of terrorism and treason (even if true) against Altaf 
Hussain are not going to break this nexus. White Papers of the Zia 
regime or even the court verdicts did not break the bonds between 
Bhutto and the shirtless of Pakistan. The Agartala case did not cut 
the ties between Mujib and the Bengalis. This does not mean that the 
government should prostrate before Altaf Hussain. But it does mean 
that the government should know the limitations of its media pitch 
against him.
It sounds so presumptuous to be reading this primer of mass politics 
to a populist leader like Benazir. But I do honestly feel that she 
should be exercising her own political judgment a lot more frequently 
and (in case of the MQM and Mohajirs) more objectively. As Dr Mubashir 
Hassan recently wrote, it is more fruitful and safe, at times, for 
politicians to follow their own instincts than to listen to 
intelligence agencies or go by administration prescriptions.
Returning to the main theme of this article, I would like to comment 
on two other factors which, according to some quarters, are blocking 
progress to a deal in Sindh. One is the question of the majesty of law 
and the other is the MQM s alleged Indian connection. At the outset, 
it must be said that no other matter should summon our leaders to 
statesmanship as insistently as these two questions.
It is true that rulers must uphold and respect the majesty of law. 
Without this, civilised existence and social order are inconceivable. 
But it is equally true that statesmen must respect the higher 
interests of state and society even more. Such are the supreme 
dictates of statecraft that most constitutions in the world contain 
provisions for pardon and reprieve.
Churchill did not like Gandhi for one minute. But when, during the 
closing phase of the Second World War, he was apprised of the 
possibility that the Mahatama might die in the custody of the British 
Indian government, he could immediately foresee, as a statesman, that 
it would cause a mighty explosion of anger and fury in India. This 
would help neither India nor the British empire. So he agreed with the 
proposal for Gandhi s release whatever the personal feelings. But he 
did not have to and, he did not, concede for a single moment that 
Gandhi s initial detention in 1942, at the beginning of the Quit 
India movement, was wrong. Thus he upheld the majesty of law and yet 
bowed before dictates of the higher interests of the empire.
Regarding the Indian connection (if there is one) statesmanship 
demands a broad-minded approach. We have to distinguish between cause 
and effect. We must determine honestly whether the Indian connection 
is the cause or the effect of Mohajir alienation. If we come to the 
conclusion that it is the effect of alienation, we should proceed on 
the assumption that the end of the alienation will break the 
connection.
Still, I believe that as time goes on, the barrenness of present 
stances on both sides will get exposed more and more. When this 
happens, given their age-old wisdom and decency, ordinary Mohajirs 
will start putting pressure on the MQM and ordinary Sindhis on the PPP 
and other elements in Sindh to bring down the mental equivalent of the 
Berlin Wall between the two brotherly communities. It is my dream that 
one day the MQM will become MSM (Muttahida Sindh Movement). It is my 
dream that one day a Sindhi will get elected as MNA from Liaquatabad 
on an MQM (MSM of my dream) ticket and a Mohajir will get elected as 
MNA from Larkana on a PPP ticket.
It is my dream that one day the governor, the chief minister and all 
ministers of Sindh could be Mohajirs. Nobody will find anything 
unusual or objectionable about this because by then this wretched 
business of us and them would have been overcome and we shall all 
be a one, single and unified people of Sindh.

<a name="kara">Karachi s firing lines</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
KARACHI has developed its own way of keeping itself in the focus of 
national attention. The killing toll mounts and so does public concern 
about that what is happening to the city. This is followed by a lull 
which in Karachi s case means that, instead of a dozen or more people 
being killed, only about three or four are randomly shot. This is 
taken as a sign of returning normality and it encourages General Babar 
to claim, with all the authority that he can muster, that things are 
on the mend and that the back of terrorism has been broken. Hardly 
have the echoes of his words subsided when the Sindh Secretariat is 
attacked, in broad daylight, by rocket-propelled grenades. After this 
dramatic interlude - dramatic because an attack of this kind on the 
symbol of the province s authority is no laughing matter - Karachi 
reverts to its pattern of five, six or a dozen people being randomly 
killed, with the tally in between shooting up when 15 persons are shot 
in a single, cold-blooded incident. And now as if to demonstrate that 
are no safe quarters in the city anymore, police lines in District 
South come under rocket attack. The audacity of this affair is worth 
dwelling on for a moment. The attackers take positions in the centre 
of a busy road, again in broad day-light, and carry out their 
operation with ease. A number of houses in the police colony are hit 
as are the Garden and Nabi Buksh police Stations. What conclusions 
must one draw from this occurrence?
First, that the famous back of terrorism is far from broken. Second, 
that there are no safe areas in the city anymore. Third, that the time 
may have come for the government to re-examine its approach and 
priorities. How much longer will it take before the government to 
realise the shortcomings of the purely strong-handed approach? In the 
last one or two months the government has claimed successes in the 
fight against terrorism by nabbing some well-known figures on its list 
of wanted men. But this has scarcely plugged the sources or indeed the 
inspiration of violence. When there is a large sea of growing 
alienation at hand, there should be no shortage of recruits for the 
pursuit of violence.
This by no stretch of the imagination should be taken to mean that the 
government should succumb before the forces of disorder, But it 
certainly means that the short-sightedness evident in its approach to 
the question of talks with the MQM should be given up so that a 
serious dialogue can take place instead of a pantomime. The 
frustrating thing, of course, is that all these things have been said 
so often before but all pleas for sanity, moderation, a sense of give-
and-take and more seriousness in the quest for a political solution 
have fallen on dead ears. The MQM is suffering from a siege mentality 
and sees conspiracies everywhere. The government has blinkers on its 
eyes. It is following a narrow track in Karachi when the complexity 
of the situation there demands a slightly more sophisticated approach. 
Meanwhile, the dramatic intensity of the violence keeps mounting. The 
people of Karachi are close to despair because with extremism feeding 
on obstinacy and the other way round, there seems no early end in 
sight to their over-stretched misery.

<a name="amad">A madcap and chilling affair</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
EVEN by the colourful standards of military adventurism what the group 
of army officers currently under arrest were planning sends a chill 
down the spine eliminating and the entire army high command and then 
usurping political authority in the name of an Islamic order. Other 
madcap schemes down the years have flitted through the minds of 
military adventures but nothing like this has been heard of or seen in 
the annals of the Pakistan army. It is not hard to picture the chaos 
and anarchy that would have ensued if these conspirators had come 
anywhere close to achieving their aim.
The Pakistan army may have many faults and its record as a governing 
institution may not be outstanding, but if it has any internal 
strength, it flows from its monolithic character. The command 
structure is clear orders flow from top to bottom and there are cults 
or schisms in its ranks. Which is perhaps the reason why, despite the 
history of praetorianism, Pakistan has been spared the nightmare of a 
colonel or brigadier-type coup which has brought such a lurid touch to 
the politics of so many other Third World countries. In Pakistan the 
army moves to seize power it dies so as an institution - which may not 
be the most ideal thing in the world but which, if there is no other 
practical choice, it better than anarchis outbursts lower down its 
hierarchy.
But having said this, the army is under an obligation, as much for its 
own sake as for the country s to find out whether this coup attempt 
nipped in the bud flowed merely from the frustration of some 
superseded officers or whether there exist wider factors which could 
sow the seeds of discontent among the officers corps or infect a 
section of it with some wild ideas. The Zia years did expose the army 
to the winds of peculiar brand of extremism and while it is true that 
only a small section of the army was so effected, this aspect of the 
matter is still worth investigating thoroughly.
Another important consideration is ties to the larger political 
situation in the country. When there is widespread dissatisfaction 
with national affairs, regardless of whether this feeling is based on 
real or imaginary grievances some of this discontent is bound to 
ruboff on the army. This has been the mainspring of all previous 
junior-level coup attempts in the Pakistan army a group of officers 
thinking that only decisive intervention on their part could save the 
country s future. There may be wild or self-serving ambition in such 
thinking but it can be taken almost as something axiomatic that where 
popular frustration is of a high border, it is a spur to Bonapartism. 
The best safe-guard against praetorians, therefore, lies not in 
constitutional safeguards or better internal security but in a stable 
political system which enjoys the confidence of the people and which 
is seen to be working reasonably effectively. The abortive coup that 
we are talking about should, therefore, be an occasion for serious 
introspection not only on the part of the army but also on the part of 
the nation s political players- whether they are in power or in the 
opposition. They must be see how their actions are affecting democracy 
and the faith that people have in the country s political leadership.
It is good that the defence minister has laid the relevant facts 
before the Senate but it would have been much better if this exercise 
had been under taken earlier. No doubt, the army had yet to complete 
its investigations into this affair but even so it could have taken 
the nation into confidence as soon as the news of the coup attempt 
broke - instead of allowing rumour-mongering to have a field day.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="jans">Jansher demolishes Gul in 29 minutes</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dicky Rutnagur
NICOSIA (Cyprus), Nov.8 Jansher Khan, the holder and six times 
winner, remains Pakistan s sole contender at the quarter-finals stage 
of the World Open Championship.
One of his compatriots, Mir Zaman Gul, had the misfortune of falling 
in Jansher s path in the second round and was fairly crushed, beater 
15-3, 15-6, 15-7 in 29 minutes, a reflection of Jansher s authority 
and brilliance rather than his own shortcomings.
The remaining Pakistani, Zarak Jahan Khan, went down in a gallant 
fashion to the fifth-seeded Englishman, Simon Parke, who has never 
progressed beyond the last 16 in six previous attempts. Creative and 
at the same time sound and crafty in defence, Parke won 15-5, 16-17, 
15-8, 15-8 in 67 minutes.
Parke s reward for a truly splendid win, however, is a quarter-finals 
clash with the mighty Jansher, to whom he lost in straight games in 
the final of the US Open, in Rhode Island, a fortnight ago.
Asked about his prospects against the redoubtable champion, Parke 
said The only way to beat him is to attack and that without making 
mistakes. To do that is difficult, if not impossible for, the bigger 
the occasion, the tighter Jansher plays .
Jansher played impeccable squash, authoritative and effortless, to 
beat Mir Zaman, who was left helpless. Jansher s errors were 
restricted to a mere six in 61 rallies that the match contained and 
allowed Mir Zaman, by no means an attritional player, only eight 
winners, four of them in the last game.
The champion had runs of eight points and six points in the first 
game, and went from eight to 13 in the second without conceding a 
point. The extent of his superiority over Mir Zaman must have struck 
awe into his remaining challengers but, in the context of Pakistan s 
defence of the World Team Championship next week, it could have done 
immense damage to the morale of one of his team-mates.
But Jansher said I dropped a game in the first round and that was a 
reminder that I must concentrate and win as quickly as I can because 
energy must be conserved for the big matches .
Parke might test Jansher somewhat, but in the light of events that 
followed, the champion should not be too hard pressed in the semi-
finals for, the other main seed in his half, Scotland s Peter Nicol, 
who was a semi-finalist last year in Barcelona, was beaten by Sami 
Elopuro, the World number 12. So Jansher s semi-finals opponent could 
be either Elopuro or Anthony Hill, of Australia.
Tactical acumen as much as skill enabled Parke to get the better of 
Zarak, who had beaten him on both the last two occasions they met. But 
Parke is currently playing in splendid form which has led to the 
Englishman being in confident mood.
Parke said Zarak likes a fast pace because he feeds on it and my aim 
was to prevent him from doing that . However, the Englishman played 
purposefully, making abundant use of the sidewalls to build up 
pressure in the first game, which he won in only ten minutes, 
conceding a mere five points.
But Zarak was not dispirited by this initial reverse and started the 
second game with a series of winners which put him 6-1 in front. But 
helped by two successive errors by the Pakistani, Parke climbed back. 
Every rally was hotly contested, with both adversaries playing 
dazzling shots.
Their smooth movement which eliminated obstruction added to the 
sparkle in the match that was expertly controlled by referee David 
Stephenson. Zarak stayed in front until he was caught up at 11. Two 
brilliant winners in the course of the next three rallies put him on 
game point at 14-11.
But Parke retaliated with a backhand kill, a winning volley and a 
clinging volley drop which restored equality and forced the game into 
setting. Zarak got to game point again, at 16-15, with a drop off a 
loose boast, only to drum the tin in going for the winning point with 
a forehand kill. Parke chanced his arm with a backhand angle which 
went down and gave Zarak the game over the last available point.
Parke tightened up his game thereafter and varied the pace without 
totally abandoning enterprise. He pulled away after 4-all and when he 
got to 10-6, it was clear that the third game would be his. Zarak 
stayed in the match until Parke took three points in a row to go to 
11-7.
At that stage, Zarak betrayed the first signs of tiredness and the 
hint was enough for Parke to exert greater authority which took him 
rapidly to the winning post.

<a name="infi">Jansher in final, Eyles ousted</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dicky Rutna
NICOSIA, Nov 10 Holder Jansher Khan, of Pakistan, reached the final 
of the World Open Championship with a 15-7, 15-12, 15-6 win in a 
scrappy match against Australian Anthony Hill.
The Pakistani, who is in line for a record-breaking seventh title and 
will be playing his eighth final in nine years, was troubled more by 
Hill s obstructionist tactics than his skill.
Jansher s opponent in the final is England s Del Harris, who overcame 
spirited resistance from the unseeded Australian, Craig Rowland, and 
won 10-15, 15-13, 
15-4, 15-8.
Australian Rodney Eyles, seeded two and Jansher Khan s expected 
opponent in the final, was knocked out at the last eight stage of the 
Championship by England s Del Harris in a sensational 87-minute match 
on Thursday.
However, Eyles s unseeded compatriot, Craig Rowland made the semi-
finals, comfortably beating Englishman Mark Chalenor who had knocked 
out Brett Martin on Wednesday.
It took Jansher 56 minutes to beat Simon Parke, of England, 15-5, 17-
15, 15-9, in Thursday s quarter-finals, with 21 spent on the second 
game. It was only in that game that the match was a contest.
Discussing his prospects against Jansher on the previous day after 
beating Zarak Jahan Khan, Parke had said I know how to beat Jansher. 
But the difficult bit is the execution of the plan. The way to beat 
him is to attack him without making mistakes. But is that possible? 
Moreover, you would have to be strong enough to stay on court for 
nearly two hours .
No doubt, Parke, reeling off a variety of attacking shots, played well 
enough during the period of his ascendancy while Jansher only seemed 
to be coasting. Then suddenly, he stepped up his pace with some robust 
volleying which pushed Parke to the back of the court and had him 
scrambling.
Jansher s points came from a series of beautiful drops, which clung to 
the side walls and died the instant they made contact with the floor. 
Having collected seven points in a row - six with winners and the 
remaining from a penalty - Jansher was on game ball at 16-14 before 
Parke retaliated with a winning volley. But then he hit down with a 
forehand drop and Jansher was two games up.
Parke, who was overwhelmed in the first game, had little strength left 
in his legs to be able to make a fight of the third.

NICOSIA, Nov 11 Jansher Khan had to fight hard for 101 minutes to 
beat England s surprise finalist Del Harris and win the World Open 
Squash Championship for a record seventh time.
Fluffing a volley through excitement at match point in the third game, 
Jansher was stretched to four and won 15-10, 17-14, 16-17, 15-8.
Only once before in the seven World finals that Jansher has won was he 
subjected to a stronger challenge. That was in Kuala Lumpur, in 1989, 
when he was 1-2 behind in games and 0-6 down in the fifth against the 
rangy Australian, Chris Dittmar.
Jansher was happy with the way he played, but was clearly not at his 
best. He said Breaking the record was playing on my mind and made me 
very careful. Also, I had blisters on my right foot and I felt pain 
when I had to move suddenly or stretch for the ball in front.
 But I have to concede that Del played very well. I have played him 
quite often recently, but he was never as determined as he was today. 
If he stays as fit as he is now, he is going to be in the forefront. 
Harris is by reputation a flamboyant, attacking player, as he showed 
when beating the second-seeded Rodney Eyles in the quater-finals. But 
on this occasion, he played patiently and thoughtfully, showing a 
preparedness to engage in long rallies which, to Jansher, come as 
second nature.
Considering that he was pitted against a player of the highest order, 
who allows few liberties, Harris made a negligible number of unforced 
errors.
Jansher, on the other hand, made more than his normal quota, not least 
because he was exceptionally tense.
The first game was won by Jansher by the clear margin of five points, 
but it took him 23 minutes to capture it. The second was even longer 
and Jansher was 8-11 and 10-13 behind, looking likely to lose it. But 
he lifted his game and hit a series of winners to take it over 
setting.
In the third, Harris never let Jansher get more than two points ahead 
and stood level with him at 13. A wristy crosscourt shot in front put 
him on match point. He had victory in his grasp when Harris presented 
him an opportunity to volley at close range. But in his excitement, he 
put the ball in the tin.
A mishit volley by Harris gave him a second match point at 16-15, but 
Harris responded with a winning drop and seized the game with a 
volleyed winner.
Despite making a couple of shoddy errors at the start, Jansher led 7-3 
in the fourth game. Harris s legs were now ostensibly wobbling through 
tiredness, but Jansher was still shy to mount an all-out offensive and 
bided his time for victory to fall into place.
Jansher Khan has definitely staked his claim to be the best squash 
player of all time as he won a record seventh world title.
For Khan, now unbeaten in 13 tournaments dating back to early 1994, it 
was yet another milestone on the way to his ultimate ambition of 
becoming the greatest ever.
The three candidates are Australia s Geoff Hunt, an eight-time British 
Open winner and four-time world champion, Jahangir Khan of Pakistan, a 
10-time British Open winner and a six-time world champion, compared to 
Jansher Khan s seven world titles, one better than his compatriot, and 
four British Opens.
Khan, after a slight hiccup losing a game to England s John Ransome in 
the first round, won three easy matches, before Harris threatened him 
again.
Earlier in the week, Khan said he had been feeling the pressure as he 
went for his seventh title. He looked under pressure in the final as 
he continually questioned let calls.
Meanwhile, England s Del Harris, who was British champion and in the 
world s top 10 as a teenager before slumping to below 30, now has his 
name back in lights.
Harris, 26, who has since lost two stone in weight and upped his 
training schedule, was not up to the mastery of world number one Khan.
A backhand volley error by Harris brought Khan the first game, but 
many errors by a tense Khan in the second game gave Harris a 13-10 
lead.
However Khan upped a gear to hit four consecutive winners for a 14-13 
lead in a game he eventually won 17-14.
Khan let slip two match points in the third game at 15-14 and 16-15 as 
Harris went on to win the game 17-16 with a winner as Khan was 
stranded at the front of the court.
However, in the fourth game, Khan raced to a 9-4 lead and grew in 
confidence to win it 15-8.

<a name="paki">Pakistan shut out Egypt in squash team contest</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dicky Rutnagur
CAIRO, Nov. 14 Pakistan, the holders, were fought hard by host 
country Egypt in winning their opening match in the World Team 
Championship 2-1.
Egypt were inspired by the frenzied support of the home crowd and 
considerably aided by the slow front wall of a cold court with which 
their players were fully familiar.
Turning the conditions to advantage by employing the lob-and-drop 
game Omar El Borolossy, ranked as low as 50 in the world, beat the 
experienced Mir Zaman Gul in the first rubber, between the number 
three and the mighty Jansher Khan himself had to fight hard to get the 
better of Amir Wagih, the Egyptian number one.
Jansher comfortable took the first game but the world champion was 
forced to concede the second, in which Wagih took the lead after 3-all 
and stayed in front until the end.
Whenever he caught Jansher on the wrong foot or off-balance Wagih 
scored with wristy cross-shots into the nick. Jansher s task was made 
no easier by the blisters on his feet reducing his mobility.
Wagih continued to threaten in the third game too. Hitting four 
classic winners in a row, he neutralised Jansher s early lead of 4-1 
and caught up with him at five. A penalty point turned his fortunes, 
however. It put Jansher level at six and in his frustration the 
Egyptian hit the tin. On the next point, Jansher hit the side wall 
nick with a backhand cross court and pounced on a rare short ball from 
Wagih to grab the winning point.
In the deciding tie, Zarak Jahan Khan, was absolutely brilliant. 
Opposition to him by the World junior champion, Ahmed Barada, was 
restricted to the first game which, although decided by the large 
margin of 9-4, lasted 19 minutes and contained 20 hands. But Zarak 
wrapped up the remaining two games in 20 minutes. Barada becoming 
frustrated and increasingly erratic as he lost control of the match.

CAIRO, Nov. 15 True to expectations, Pakistan swamped Sweden 3-0 in 
the World Team Squash Championship but, on the eve of their crucial 
group match against England, who ran roughshod over Egypt, they had 
cause to worry.
Jansher Khan looked tired, jaded and in discomfort with the blisters 
on his feet and was fully extended by an unknown in Anders Thorsen. 
The World champion was hard put to hold to an 8-2 lead in the first 
game and won it only over setting.
He lost the second after leading 6-1 and in the third, let the Swede 
come as close as 6-7 after leading 7-0. He was outclassed in the 
fourth, but summoned his concentration and resolve to win the fifth 9-
0 in the one hand.
Pakistan were already one match up when Jansher took the court, Mir 
Zaman Gul having given short shrift to Pieter Sjosten and Zarak Jahan 
Khan, playing brilliantly as he did against Egypt s Ahmed Barada 
yesterday demolished Daniel Forslund in 29 minutes 9-1, 9-6, 9-1.

<a name="8dro">8 dropped catches Pakistan in deep trouble in Brisbane Test</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
BRISBANE, Nov.10 If the first two days of the first Test being played 
at the Gabba ground is any indication of how things will work out for 
Pakistan in this series then surely it makes you feel that they are in 
for a drubbing as at the close of play on the second day they were in 
a worse situation than on the first, when they had allowed the 
Australians to score 262 for 4 through five dropped catches.
To add to the misery of the bowlers Mohammad Akram and Waqar Younis 
who suffered because of it, there were three more catches floored on 
the second day and Australia taking full advantage of those lapses 
must have had a sense of relief and satisfaction to add over 200 runs 
more for the remaining wickets to be all out for 463 after tea on the 
second day and then pick three Pakistan wickets.
Steve Waugh, who was unbeaten at the end with 112 having reached his 
ninth Test century with the help of seven fours in 315 minutes, was 
one of the beneficiaries of Pakistan s patchy fielding.
On the first day with Australia on 252 for 4 he was dropped by Wasim 
Akram of his own bowling when 15 and before he got to the three 
figures he was let off again, not once but twice off Aamir Sohail when 
85 and 87.
Inzamam, the safest hand of the lot, let one go through his grip in 
the first slip and a few deliveries later Moin Khan missed him behind 
the stumps, and dropped Paul Reiffel too off Mohammad Akram.
The young fast bowler Akram was the one who suffered most. On the 
first day he had the disappointment of watching Salim Malik drop one 
at backward square leg from Michael Slater, and Ramiz Raja floored 
another in the slips of the same batsman. Saleem Elahi also failed to 
catch one off Waqar Younis when Slater had offered a sitter in course 
of his 42 runs.
Malik, however, succeeded in catching Mark Taylor at mid-wicket on the 
first day off Saqlain Mushtaq but that also proved to be a serious 
blow for Pakistan. Malik injured the base of his thumb and had six 
stitches inserted in his left hand which now makes things even more 
traumatic for the tourists who with three wickets down for 40 are 
faced with the prospect of a follow-on.
Salim Elahi and Ramiz Raja were caught in the slips by Taylor off 
Craig McDermott and Shane Warne for 11 and 8 respectively and the 
night-watchman Saqlain Mushtaq fell leg before to Glen McGrath before 
he had scored. Pakistan s hopes now rest on Basit Ali and Inzamam-ul-
Haq, the in-form batsmen. The only way they could now save the 
embarrassment is to try and stay at the wicket as long as possible - a 
task which will not be easier considering the pressure that they are 
in after their inept display on the field.
For Australia the second day s play was an eventful as the first. They 
resumed at 262 for 4 and were lucky that confident leg before appeal 
was turned down by Steve Randall when Steve Waugh was beaten off Wasim 
Akram within minutes of play.
At lunch the Australian pair of Waugh and Greg Blewett was still there 
with 351 runs on the board having added 101 runs for the fifth wicket.
Waugh was 66 and had reached his fifty with four boundaries in 140 
minutes batting. Blewett, a promising batsman, got his 50 after lunch 
having defied for 169 minutes with three boundaries.
With Waugh he put on 135 runs before being out off a swinging yorker 
from  Waqar when 57. Mushtaq Ahmed substituting took a brilliant catch 
in the deep to get rid of Ian Healy off Mohammad Akram when 18.
Waugh survived to get his first century against Pakistan. Waqar later 
dismissed Reiffel and McDermott and Aamir Sohail had the satisfaction 
of dismissing Warne and McGrath. But before the Australian innings 
ended, Waqar limped off the field with a cramp which does not really 
bode well for the tourists already beset with injuries.

<a name="warn">Warne Claims 7 wkts for 23 runs</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
BRISBANE, Nov.11 Pakistan s pride was severely dented by the crafty 
leg-spinner Shane Warne, who with an impressive return of 7 for 23, 
helped Australia bowl Pakistan for a miserably low 97 in their first 
innings and enforce an inevitable follow-on.
The embarrassment was understandable but by the end of the third day s 
play in the first Test at Gabba ground at least some dignity was 
restored by a face-saving 99 by opener Aamir Sohail who delighted the 
crowds with his swashbuckling innings which sadly ended when a 
swinging Yorker from Glenn McGrath slipped through his defences, but 
certainly helped Pakistan to finish at 197 for 3.
It was an enthralling performance by him considering the plight that 
Pakistan was in having lost their last seven wickets for the addition 
of only 57 runs to their overnight 40 for 3. The decimation of the 
Pakistan batting by Warne looked imminent because of the careless way 
the touring batsmen tackled him to be all out before lunch.
It was a gutless performance, very much slipshod and shoddy like their 
fielding and the same was feared when the second innings began.
But Aamir Sohail, despite the early demise of Saleem Elahi, who was 
caught at the wicket by Ian Healy off McGrath for 2 when the score was 
30, was determined not to commit the same mistake again as in the 
first innings when he carelessly swept at Warne and was stumped for 
32.
When 34 he was nearly caught by Greg Blewett at point but he survived 
to not only reach his fifty in 56 balls having hit nine fours but also 
he shared two very valuable partnerships for the second and third 
wickets with Ramiz Raja and Inzamam-ul -Haq which added 58 and 79 runs 
respectively.
There were glorious hooks, cuts and drives off the fast bowlers Craig 
McDermott, McGrath and Paul Reiffel and Warne was as much astonished 
at the transformation of Pakistan innings.
Trailing by 366 runs, Pakistan however managed to make 197 for 3 at 
stumps, which seems respectable but in the context of the match 
situation a rather disappointing day despite Sohail s effort. It 
appears face saving but in the end it may not be so unless heavens 
open and stop what is inevitable.
Besides Saleem Elahi and Aamir Sohail, Pakistan have also lost Ramiz 
Raja who was the second man out in the second innings when he 
mishooked McGrath to the keeper Healy when 16. Healy s catching of 
Elahi was his 250th victim.
For Pakistan Inzamam s unbeaten 56 in the second innings also came as 
a welcome relief because like others he too had perished in the first 
innings playing a loose drive at mid-on to be caught by Steve Waugh 
off Warne for 5.
As it is Pakistan, with Malik injured, four wickets down and 169 runs 
behind with two days remaining. They may find the going tough.

<a name="capi">Pakistan capitulate to Australia in 1st Test</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
BRISBANE, Nov.13 Pakistan s ignominious capitulation to Australia in 
the first Test at the Gabba ground by an embarrassing margin of an 
innings and 126 runs came a bit earlier than was expected and was in 
sharp contrast to the afternoon of the third day when they had managed 
to redeem some pride to score 197 for 3 after being bamboozled for 97 
in the first innings and were asked to follow on.
The Australian bowlers forced them into disgrace and dismissed them 
within an hour and half of the fourth morning to take a 1-0 lead in 
the three-match series.

They were shot out for only 240 runs in their second innings having 
added only 43 runs to their third day s score. In fact the last seven 
wickets had fallen for only 23 runs after Inzamam -ul-Haq and Basit 
Ali, the two not out batsmen, had taken the score to 217.
Once Inzamam, who had resumed at 56, was caught at mid-on by Craig 
McDermott off Mark Waugh for 62 after sharing a partnership of l50 for 
the fourth wicket, the procession began. It was in fact unstoppable as 
Shane Warne, Glen McGrath and Paul Reiffel charged against the rest of 
the batting.

Shane Warne with 4 for 54 and a match figure of 11 for 77 was the Man 
of the Match. The much publicised confrontation between the man who 
had accused Malik of offering him bribe in the last series in 
Pakistan, lasted only two minutes and four deliveries.
Malik, Obviously not in form or in fine fettle, he was circled and 
surrounded by the close-in fielders with Mark Waugh at a breathing 
distance at silly point. Nervously he prodded forward and stepped back 
before flicking one from Warne to leg and mistime a delivery into the 
hands of McDermott at mid-on who hung on to a diving catch.
An elated Warne later gave vent to his emotions by saying that he has 
dedicated his dismissal of Malik to his parents and family who backed 
him during the bribery controversy.

I enjoyed the wicket for obvious reasons. It showed that there is 
justice in this game, said Warne.

McGrath, who finished with 4 for 76, was as devastating as was the 
leg-spinner, but it was Warne who really had the last laugh. 
Wicketless in the second innings after his 7 for 23 in the first, 
Warne in his 23rd over dismissed both Wasim Akram and Salim Malik for 
6 and 0 and in his 28th he had the wickets of Waqar Younis and 
Mohammad Akram before they had opened their account.

Going down the wicket Inzamam miscued Mark Waugh and was caught. Six 
balls later Basit Ali, who never looked like getting anywhere against 
Warne, was leg before to McGrath for 25. Wasim Akram hit one straight 
into the hands of Michael Slater at long leg off Warne when 6, Malik 
in the same over was taken at mid-on.

The procession continued as Moin Khan was caught at the wicket off 
Reiffel for 9 and later Warne, in one over had Waqar Younis and 
Mohammad Akram leg before.

The performance in the first Test will haunt the pakistan team during 
the rest of their itinerary.</pre><hr>
