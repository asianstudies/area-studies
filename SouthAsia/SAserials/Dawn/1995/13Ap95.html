<a name="cong">Meeting with Benazir : Top Congressmen denounce Pressler law
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi

WASHINGTON, April 6: There was consensus among the Congressmen Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto saw on Thursday morning that the Pressler 
amendment should be done away with because it was a discriminatory law 
and had failed to advance America's nonproliferation concerns.

Among those who expressed their disillusionment with the results of the 
Pressler amendment were some leading Congressmen, including 
Representative Benjamin Gilman, the present chairman of the House 
Foreign Relations Committee, Congressmen Lee Hamilton, its former 
chairman and now a ranking Republican member, and Congressman Robert 
Livingston, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.

They were among no less than 25 Representatives, members of the foreign 
affairs committee and subcommittees whom the Prime Minister and her 
party met this morning to brief them on Pakistan's position on the aid 
cut-off and its negative impact on relations between the two countries.

Some of the Congressmen agreed with the Prime Minister in her 
denunciation of the Pressler law and used strong language. 
Representative Dana Rohrabacher, an HIRC member who recently introduced 
a resolution on Kashmir in the House, called the Pressler amendment 
"outrageous," while Congressman Doug Bereuter, chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Near East and South Asia, said he would like to "wipe it 
off the statute book."

Several members of the subcommittee agreed with their chairman and said 
they realised the amendment had failed to promote nonproliferation and 
had become an impediment in relations with Pakistan.

<hr><a name="clin"><b>Changes in Pressler  law being sought: Clinton</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi

WASHINGTON, April 11: President Clinton said here on Tuesday he was 
working with Congress to seek changes in the Pressler Amendment because 
it was a law directed only against Pakistan.

Even though the President made no firm commitment that the Pressler 
amendment would be abolished, he kept no secret of his distaste for the 
law under which he said he could not transfer the defence equipment to 
Pakistan while the money had already been spent.

The law had placed Pakistan, he said, in "a no man's land."

Prime Minister Bhutto on her turn said she was "deeply encouraged" by 
President Clinton's attitude and the understanding he had shown of 
Pakistan's position on the Pressler amendment and the security situation 
in the area.

Since he had been President, he said he had "done everything possible to 
broaden our ties with Pakistan," and deepen cooperation in other fields. 
When he became President, the Pressler amendment had already gone into 
effect. "That's what I found out when I became President."

He said he was the first President to declare that holding back both the 
money and the equipment was wrong. Therefore, he would "do my very best" 
to explore possibilities with Congress in a way "that's fair to 
Pakistan."

"I have no intention of dumping Pakistan," he replied when a questioner 
asked him whether or not the world would get a wrong signal if the 
United States dumped Pakistan, a country that had been America's ally 
for half a century.

The President said he would not abandon Pakistan, because "the future of 
the entire part of the world where Pakistan is depends in some large 
measure on Pakistan's success."

On Kashmir, President Clinton said the United states was willing to play 
a mediatory role, and he believed many other Indo-Pakistan problems 
could be tackled if the Kashmir issue were resolved. He said he 
emphasised to Indian Prime Minister Rao when he was here, the need for a 
solution to the Kashmir issue.

Prime Minister Bhutto said the Clinton administration regarded Kashmir 
as disputed territory and welcomed President Clinton's mediation offer, 
but regretted that India was not willing to accept this.

President Clinton made it clear that an improvement in relations with 
Pakistan would continue along with a similar movement toward India.

"I am happy to note that the United States recognises Kashmir as 
disputed territory and maintains that a durable solution to the dispute 
can only be based on the will of the Kashmiri people.

"Pakistan asked for a re-assessment of the Pressler amendment which 
places discriminatory sanctions on Pakistan. In our view this amendment 
is a disincentive for a regional solution to the proliferation issue.   

"I am encouraged by my discussions with the President and the 
understanding he has shown for Pakistan's position. I welcome the 
Clinton administration's decision to work with Congress to revise the 
Pressler Amendment.

<hr><a name="opt">Officials hint at new law : US Congress may evolve options for 
flexibility
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, April 12: New legislation may be required in the US Congress 
to show flexibility towards Pakistan, as promised by President Bill 
Clinton after talks with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Tuesday, two 
senior Clinton administration officials said on Tuesday.

Briefing newsmen at the White House after the joint news conference by 
Mr Clinton and Ms Bhutto, US Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel 
and Director of Near East and South Asian Affairs Ellen Laipson said the 
new legislation could go on the various legislative vehicles in Congress 
and it would be upto Congress to determine what some of the best options 
available might be.

Ms Laipson said the first consultations with Congress were going to be 
about flexibility in areas other than the F-16s, such as ability to work 
together in economic areas, in counter-terrorism and various aspects of 
the relationships that have been adversely affected by the Pressler 
amendment.

Ms Raphel said President Clinton was conscious of the range of opinion 
on the Hill (Congress) and wanted to work with what was achievable and 
"where there is consensus on the Hill that some new flexibility is in 
order."

She said the efforts of the administration were part of the continuing 
effort started by the Talbott visit to India and Pakistan. "It is all 
the part of the same effort to resolve the same problem, how do we move 
forward in our relationship with Pakistan in the context of our 
regional-global non-proliferation responsibilities," she said.

<hr><a name="stic">Pressler sticks to his stand
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi

WASHINGTON, April 8: Senator Larry Pressler, who "disclosed" in a recent 
interview that Pakistan had nine to ten assembled nuclear bombs, said 
here on Friday the transfer of even one F-16 to Islamabad would be 
"preposterous".

In a highly anti-Pakistan statement designed to sabotage moves in the 
administration and Congress to repeal or modify the amendment named 
after him, Senator Pressler listed the "consequences" he feared if the 
F-16s Islamabad had paid for, were transferred to it.

These consequences, according to him, were: there would be a nuclear 
race in South Asia, Pakistani nuclear weapons could fall into the hands 
of terrorists, the world would get a wrong signal about the 
administration's nonproliferation policies, and there might even be a 
nuclear war between Pakistan and India.

The vituperative statement referred to the Clinton administration's one-
time waiver proposal last year under which the transfer of the planes to 
Pakistan was to be "unconditional". It was later modified, he said, with 
the condition that Pakistan promise to "cap its nuclear weapons 
arsenal".

In recent weeks again, he said, the Clinton administration "has been at 
it again, proposing a one billion dollars package of military equipment, 
consisting mainly of the F-16s".

Calling the latest plan "unacceptable", the Senator from South Dakota 
said, "I am astounded that an administration that pays so much lip 
service to the cause of nuclear nonproliferation would consider 
providing Pakistan with aircraft capable of carrying a nuclear weapon".

The author of the Pressler amendment welcomed Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto to the United States, recalled visiting "her beautiful country" 
last year but added, "I suspect that it is largely due to the visit of 
Prime Minister Bhutto that the Clinton administration once again is 
publicly questioning the effectiveness of the so-called Pressler 
amendment".

No more a member of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 
Senator Pressler recalled his non-proliferation moves, and said his 
amendment was "a compromise" unlike that offered by former Senator Alan 
Cranston that would have cut off all aid to Pakistan immediately. Even 
the government of Pakistan, he said, "did not object to the amendment, 
because they claimed they were not pursuing a nuclear option".

Despite "claiming to have a strong policy on nuclear nonproliferation", 
he said, the Clinton administration consistently had shown hostility 
toward the Pressler amendment, the only nonproliferation law "with 
teeth."

"Never before in history", he alleged, "has a nation sought to transfer 
nuclear delivery vehicles to a country that has nuclear weapons and says 
it is doing so in the interest of nuclear nonproliferation".   

Alleging that the Clinton plan "defies basic common sense" Senator 
Pressler blamed American aerospace firms for the initiative for the 
release of the F-16s. "The transfer of F-16s would mean new business, 
new contracts, and new jobs here at home. I suspect these firms are 
putting tremendous pressure on the Clinton administration to push for 
military aid to Pakistan."

He added, "I fear India will be forced to rethink its current military 
force structure if Pakistan takes delivery of the F-16s, including 
resumption of their nuclear programme, deployment of short-range 
weapons, and even development of long-range options".

<hr><a name="asse">Assef sees one-time Pressler law
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Our Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, April 7: Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali said here 
on Thursday he was "fairly optimistic" that by year's end the Pressler 
amendment would be repealed or changed to Pakistan's advantage. His 
comment coincided with a report in the well informed Defence News that 
the Clinton administration was working with Congress once again for a 
one-time waiver for the Pressler law to end the impasse on the held-up 
military equipment, including F-16s.

Told he was being "overly optimistic," the foreign minister said he was 
"fairly optimistic".

Defence News quoted Senator Hank Brown, chairman of the Subcommittee on 
South Asia as saying, "We have to figure out some way to get those 
planes to them."

However, the basis of the foreign minister's observation was the daylong 
dialogue Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had with some leading senators, 
including majority leader Bob Dole and Senator Jesse Helms, chairman of 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on US-Pakistan relations and the 
freeze on the delivery of the arms Islamabad has already paid for.

Senator Dole, who is a presidential contender for the 1996 race, said 
after listening to arguments from the Pakistani side that the decision 
to hold back both the F-16s and the money was "pretty hard to defend. 
"He said, "I'm impressed with her arguments, and I'll try and follow 
up."

The remarks by the majority leader came on the heels of the admission by 
President Clinton a day before the Prime Minister's arrival that US 
policy toward Pakistan had failed and that there was need for seriously 
reviewing it.

None of the Senators made a categorical comment about a repeal of the 
Pressler law, but the impression the Pakistani side got was that there 
appeared unanimity between the administration and Congress on the 
question of softening the impact of the sanctions.

Senator Helms showed the unusual gesture of taking the Prime Minister 
into the Senate for a meeting with other Senators, including Hank Brown, 
Edward Kennedy, Patrick Leahy, Chris Dodd, Arlen Specter (chairman of 
the appropriations committee), Strom Thurmond, John Chafee, Paul 
Coverdell and others.

Most if not all of them assured the Prime Minister that they would work 
for a repeal of the Pressler law when it came up.

Senators present during the meeting with Chairman Helms included 
Clairbone Pell, who was chairman of the Senator F.R.C. until Democratic 
defeat last November, Richard Lugar and Sam Nunn, who is chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee but had come to the Helms office to meet the 
Prime Minister.

Senator Helms made a faux pas when he mistakenly referred to Ms Bhutto 
as Prime Minister of India but later apologised and requested that the 
record be corrected.

On her part, the Prime Minister reviewed Pakistan's foreign policy and 
touched upon all major issues, including Kashmir, nonproliferation, 
Afghanistan, terrorism, drug trafficking and US-Pakistan relations, 
which she said had been "frozen" for the last five years because of the 
Pressler sanctions.

There was what Sardar Assef called "a candid discussion" between the two 
sides, and the Senators asked "all kinds of questions," including Indo-
Pakistan relations, Pakistan's internal situation and the blasphemy 
laws.

On the nuclear question, Sardar Assef said the Prime Minister made clear 
there would be no compromise on Pakistan's security.

Briefing Pakistani newsmen on the Prime Minister's visit to Capitol 
Hill, the Foreign Minister said the efforts made by Pakistan were now 
beginning to bear fruit.

Until now, even though both Congress and the administration had realised 
the futility of the Pressler law, none was prepared to act. The big 
question was, as he put, "Who will bell the cat?"

But now, as a result of the government's "multi-faceted strategy," 
things were moving both in the administration and in Congress. Pakistan, 
he said, was no more having "a single track diplomacy" revolving round 
the military relationship.

Since the Pressler law was hurting US business interest, the powerful 
corporate sector, which was now investing massively in Pakistan, was 
working for a repeal of the sanctions.

There was cooperation with the United States, he said, in many fields, 
including combating terrorism and drug trafficking, and interior 
minister Naseerullah Babar had had useful dialogues with the FBI and 
other American security agencies.

"To our good fortune," the foreign minister said, "a number of factors 
have combined" to move things for Pakistan.

Asked how long he thought it would take for the Pressler amendment to 
go, Sardar Assef said by the end of 1995 a process would be generated 
that should give results.

The usually well-informed Defence News quoted US officials as saying the 
administration was not going for a repeal of the Pressler law; instead, 
it was working with Congress to seek "a one-time exception as a goodwill 
gesture to a long-time Cold War ally with which relations have 
deteriorated."

<hr><a name="pmas">PM asks US to initiate talks on South Asia 
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Masood Haider

NEW YORK, April 9: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Saturday asked the 
United States to initiate "multilateral talks on South Asia with the 
participation of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council 
and other major powers like Germany and Japan", in order to avoid a 
missile and nuclear arms race in the region as a result of Indian arms 
build-up.

These talks, she said, should focus on three broad areas: the resolution 
of regional conflicts and, in particular, Kashmir; conventional arms 
control; and non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Speaking at the Princeton University campus in New Jersey, on the eve of 
her official visit to Washington which begins on April 11, Ms Bhutto 
underscored India's arms build-up which threatened peace in South Asia 
and would accelerate nuclear and missile arms race in the region.

She said: "America's enormous influence today imposes a responsibility 
on Washington to intercede at least actively in South Asia as it has in 
the Middle East.

"The multilateral forum should also address the threat posed by the 
increasing imbalance in conventional weapons between India and 
Pakistan", stressed the Prime Minister, who added that "the 
international community must also come together to bring a regional 
solution to stem proliferation."

Talking extensively on the Kashmir dispute, Ms Bhutto asserted that 
"India has adopted an inflexible and belligerent posture on Kashmir 
because it believes that the major powers are unwilling to censure its 
human rights violations", in the Valley.

"India", she said, "has the second largest army in the world today, 
mostly deployed against Pakistan. During the past decade, India was 
world's largest arms importer."

Referring to India's nuclear programme which threatens the stability in 
the South Asian region, Ms Bhutto said "India exploded a nuclear device 
in 1974 - ironically called the smiling Buddha".

She brought the house down when she added sarcastically: "I wonder if 
Buddha was smiling when it happened."

She said: "Now twenty years after its nuclear explosion, India is about 
to take another fateful step toward proliferationuthe production and 
deployment of Prithvi, a short-range, nuclear-capable missile. Once it 
is produced, we must presume that it has been deployed Benazir urge 
multilateral talks on S. Asia and we shall have to respond accordingly."

PRESSLER AMENDMENT: Touching on the subject of the infamous Pressler 
Amendment, which has stopped all American military and economic aid to 
Pakistan since 1990, as the United States suspected that Pakistan has 
capability of producing a nuclear device, the Prime Minister declared 
unequivocally: "Pakistan has not made a nuclear device, nor tested one, 
yet Pressler has been applied to us".

She quoted US Defence Secretary William Perry as telling her recently 
that the Pressler Amendment is a "blunt instrument saying, "I saw no 
evidence that it has increased the US influence or leverage with 
Pakistan. To the contrary, I saw ample evidence that it has undermined 
the influence we formerly had there."

She pointed out that India, a country aligned with the former Soviet 
Union for full 45-year-long Cold War, had supported the communist regime 
in Kabul, detonated a nuclear device, suffered no sanctions.

While saying that, "of course, we want the US sanctions against Pakistan 
lifted on economic and humanitarian and development assistance", Ms 
Bhutto observed that the "United States should honour its contractual 
obligations to us, morally and legally, and release our equipment which 
sits in the deserts of Arizona.

"Included amongst this Pakistan property are 28 F-16s defensive 
interceptor aircraft, but, she said,

I "if the United States cannot honour its contract with us, we expect 
the US to return our money in fairness. The planes, or our money back. 
That simple that fair."

During the question answer session, when Ms Bhutto was asked about the 
horrendous law and order situation in Karachi, she responded by saying: 
"We are doing our best. One dead in Karachi is one too many."

About the women and human rights situation in Pakistan, Ms Bhutto said 
that since she assumed power, some 17 months back, women had been 
appointed to various positions of authority, including to the posts of 
the judges of the higher court.

She drew a big applause when she related the incident about a woman in a 
village of Pakistan and her encounter  with the First Lady of the United 
States, Hillary Clinton, during the latter's visit recently.

Most students and faculty members at the Princeton University were awe-
struck with Prime Minister Bhutto's charm, grace and poise. Her address 
was frequently interrupted with applause.

Many said: "We can't believe she's here. It's a great day for us. It's a 
great day for Pakistan."

Earlier, the president of the university, Prof R. Sahpiro, welcomed Ms 
Bhutto to the campus.

MODERATION: Prime Minister Bhutto said Pakistan was committed to 
constitutional rule, independence of judiciary and a free market 
economy, and was a force for moderation and stability in the Islamic 
world, adds APP.

She said Pakistan, upholding the principle of free markets and economic 
liberalisation, wanted to integrate fully into the world economy.

She told the university elite and senior academics that the peaceful 
paradigm of Islam prescribed tolerance and accommodation u not extremism 
or violence. Islamic leaders had confirmed this at their summit in 
Casablanca last December.

Pakistan, she said, was committed to the values of democracy and human 
rights, values which had proved their relevance and durability, values 
which had triumphed in the Cold War.

She said the new and free whorl could not be mana8ed by conclaves of the 
rich and powerful. This would lead to repeated revolts by the 
underprivileged.

She said Pakistan was being guided by the realities of communication 
revolution and the changes in the concept of sovereignty in its post-
Cold War policy.

She said the communication revolution would change the concept of space 
and sovereignty and the nations which could not gear themselves to a 
global outlook integrating with the new information superhighway would 
be left behind in the race of time. The concept of sovereignty would 
undergo changes as economic and financial powers moved from nation-
states to international financial markets.

Ms Bhutto said Pakistan's foreign relations were being geared towards 
trade not aid, creating international conditions for increased foreign 
investment, and exploiting the country's geostrategic position to have 
financial influence as a trading centre.

She said Pakistan was working with friends in the world on democracy, 
human rights, the environments, population control, antiterrorists 
measures, international peace-keeping and  job creation.

The future of the people of Pakistan was not passive Pakistan, but an 
activist Pakistan, an active Pakistan in the march of civilisation.

She said she was seeking to establish a politically conscious and 
globally aware Pakistan fulfilling its international obligations and 
international responsibilities a Pakistan at peace with itself and the 
world, a Pakistan reflecting the message of universal humanism, 
rejecting religious rigidity but welcoming spiritual strength and 
sustenance from Allah. This, she said, was her vision of Pakistan's 
international role in the third millennium.

Ms Bhutto said the bipolar world of the Cold War period was supported by 
the concept of mutually assured nuclear destruction. This simplistic but 
powerful dichotomy maintained a fragile peace by freezing territorial, 
ethnic and other disputes in various parts of the world.

She said that in many ways the clarity of the Cold War had been replaced 
by the confusion of the post-Cold-War era. Even worse I than confusion, 
the world might be on the edge of a new age of cynical exploitation of 
the poor by the rich, of the weak by the strong, which characterised the 
world from the Congress of Vienna to the Treaty of Versailles.

She said  it would be unfortunate if the foreign relations  were pursued 
through the prism of a new crusade between the Christian and the Muslim 
worlds, between the North and the South. It would be equally unfortunate 
if the United States disengaged itself from the rest of the world on the 
assumption that the chaos characterising this age of transition could 
not be controlled or rectified.

A half century struggle for freedom, she emphasised, should not end with 
isolationism.  

She said Pakistan fully accepted its international role. It had 
committed troops to Cambodia, to be Gulf, to Bosnia, and to Haiti. 
Pakistan's soldiers had been described as the most professional, the 
best trained and highly motivated.

She said it was important to ensure that double standard was not allowed 
to define the new era. The defence of human dignity and justice, she 
said, was indivisible, and must be pursued universally.

She said that as an original  signatory to the ban on biological 
weapons, and one of the architects of the chemical weapons collection, 
Pakistan's contribution to non-proliferation of weapons of mass 
destruction was significant.

Pakistan was now actively engaged in negotiations for a comprehensive 
test-ban treaty and a fissile material convention, and, had proposed the 
creation of a nuclear-weapons-free zone in South Asia and a zero missile 
regime.

She said unfortunately Indian ambitions had cast a long shadow, over its 
neighbours: Pakistan Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

*From  Our Staff Correspondent


WASHINGTON, April 8: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto denied here on 
Saturday that Pakistan was quietly building a nuclear reactor that would 
produce large quantities of plutonium used in manufacturing nuclear 
weapons.

The Washington Post today claimed in a report written by three staggers 
that Pakistan was "quietly building" a nuclear reactor that would give 
Islamabad "access to substantial quantities of plutonium for more 
powerful and compact nuclear weapons than it now possesses".

The report is the latest in an anti Pakistan campaign launched to 
coincide with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's highly successful talks 
with congressional leaders of Thursday.

In a headline that ran across the top of the back page in the main 
section, the paper said the plans were proceeding "to the dismay of some 
Clinton administration officials".

The US, it said, had been trying to "persuade several governments, 
including China, not to cooperate with Pakistan on the reactor". But 
Pakistan "has not publicised the project, which has been under way for 
several years and will not be completed until 1996 or later".

The paper said that work on the reactor could "undermine a combined 
Pakistani-Clinton administration effort to suspend or alter" the 
Pressler amendment.

The six-column headline screamed "Pakistan building reactor that may 
yield large quantities of plutonium".

The paper said Prime Minister Bhutto told The Post in an interview she 
doubted such a reactor existed. However, she said the project involved, 
"a small reactor for an experimental purpose".

The Prime Minister said the reactor, being built near Khushab, was "tied 
into our nuclear power plant from China". Besides, Pakistan lacked the 
capability eventually to reprocess the reactor's spent fuel, an act that 
would separate the plutonium in that fuel and enable it to be used in 
unclear weaponary."

The Prime Minister added: "We have no plans to produce plutonium". She 
repeated Pakistan's well-known position on the nuclear question that 
Islamabad could not give up its nuclear plans so long as India 
maintained its own programme and developed ballistic missiles.

According to US officials, the power-generating capacity of the Khushab 
nuclear reactor has been rated at 40 megawatts. It is a heavy water-
style reactor, similar to the one used by India in 1970s to produce 
plutonium for nuclear weapons.

The paper said since it was going to be a reactor built largely with 
indigenous technology, it would not be subject to international 
inspections.

According to the newspaper US officials confirmed Prime Minister 
Bhutto's statement that Pakistan cannot reprocess the reactor's 
plutonium-laden spent fuel, and said the Clinton administration was 
"unaware of any Pakistani plans to build such a capability".

But they "noted" that the Chinese-assisted reactor being built near 
Chashma could be completed "in several years if Pakistan chose to do 
so".

The paper quoted US official as saying Pakistan had "an arsenal of ten 
nuclear weapons. The weapons are based on a Chinese design that uses 
highly enriched uranium as the fuel for nuclear fission".   

Smaller and more powerful plutonium-based weapons could fit more easily 
onto ballistic missiles, said the paper, which quoted well informed 
officials as saying, "we have been trying for years to stop items" from 
going to Khushab in an effort to block its construction.

<hr><a name="soot">Soothsayer in the company of PM
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Shaheen Sehabi

WASHINGTON, April 6: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is accompanied on her 
US visit by her revered soothsayer, the man who tells her when to do 
what and how. "Ibra", her 'peer' is a young man with a heavy beard and a 
nervous denomination. His influence over the PM is telling, next 
probably only to husband Asif Ali Zardari.

Ibra is the pet name for Nawab Jehangir Ibrahim from Mianwali, the 
soothsayer who is envied by many in the close circle of Benazir Bhutto, 
including the cronies and hangers-on who wish he was somehow removed 
from  her entourage.

He is the latest of the peers Benazir Bhutto has been seeing regularly 
to ensure the continuity and longer life for her government. The Oxford 
educated Benazir had started believing in these soothsayers after her 
marriage to Asif Ali Zardari and had even been travelling to far-off, 
forlorn places like the northern parts of Bangladesh, to seek their 
divine help.

According to a story going around in Islamabad and circles close to her 
in Washington, Benazir even visited the Peer in Kohat who was regularly 
visited by her main political opponent Nawaz Sharif. This peer is known 
to beat his visitors with a stick and Nawaz Sharif was so fond of him 
that he even took his wife Kulsoom for such a divine beating to Kohat.

Both Nawaz Sharif and Benazir have, however, seen bad days after meeting 
these peers but their belief has apparently not diminished.

But Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan of PPP recently described Ibra to me as a 
"kammi" or the one belonging to the lower caste in the feudal jargon of 
Punjab. Aitzaz said Ibra was very well known to him as until recently he 
was an ordinary person, not even with a beard who was known for his 
mischief and antics.

Yet the fear of the unknown and the search for the knowledge of the 
future in Benazir Bhutto has brought Ibra into the small group of people 
who are in a position to guide the destiny of the country through their 
imaginary or secretly acquired powers in the realm of looking through 
the crystal maze.

When I saw Ibra last Wednesday, he was having lunch in the dining room 
of the Willard Hotel,  the costly abode of the Prime Minister's party in 
the heart of Washington D.C., just five minutes of walking distance from 
the White House. Sharing his table were the Press Assistant to the Prime 
Minister Farhatullah Babar a senior PID official Colonel Ikramullah and 
Editor Najam Sethi. Dressed in a simple grey Shalwaar-Kameez, Ibra 
looked a misfit in the PM's party which otherwise had smart cookies of 
the like of Naheed Khan, Shahnaz Wazir Ali, Shahid Hassan Khan and some 
journalists known for their loyalty to whoever occupies the seat of 
power in Islamabad.

"He was so scared of eating lest anything that could contain may enter 
his pure soul," one of those sharing his meal table later recalled. "He 
was just taking potato chips, knowing little that the fat they were 
fried in could also contain pork material," Najam Sethi said.

This extra attention to detail as necessary for a public show of 
religious devotion, although the "peer" had disappeared later in the 
evening from his room, as I kept on knocking at his door to have a few 
words with him.

Those who have travelled with Benazir say Ibra was a major factor in 
deciding when the Prime Minister would travel abroad, when she would 
perform the religious rites and which numbers were lucky or unlucky for 
her.

"The size of the official delegation to the United States has been cut 
to 29 because Ibra told Benazir Bhutto that 29 was a lucky number for 
her," they say. To accommodate the others, an unofficial entourage, and 
a large one at that, is accompanying the Prime Minister.

Ibra was said to be shivering in his pants, nay his shalwaar, on arrival 
at the Willard as his name was listed in the official list as sharing 
the same limousine with Sherry Rehman, the Editor of Herald.

"Who is Sherry, please tell me, what is she like," he is said to have 
asked another editor. Sherry was listening when the male editor conveyed 
Ibra's concern. She reacted with remarks that are unprintable.

<hr><a name="extr">Pakistan against forces of extremism: PM
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Our Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, April 6: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said here on 
Wednesday that US-Pakistan relations had been "frozen by the application 
of discriminatory statutes" and she had come to the United States to 
"raise the fairness question", either the planes or the money. 

Pakistan, the Prime Minister said. was every bit as critical to the 
world and to the United States today" as it was in "the hottest days of 
the Afghan war" and added. "We remain a central asset, politically, 
strategically, culturally and economically, in the post-Cold War 
period."

"Although, the enemies have changed," the Prime Minister said, Pakistan 
remained a front-line state. We are a front-line state against 
international terrorism; we are a front-line state against international 
narcotics trafficking we are a front-line state for moderation and  
pluralism, against the forces of extremism and ignorance."

Pakistan would remain important she said, "in the new millenniun."

The Prime Minister criticised America's nonproliferation policy and 
demanded that the United  States honour its contractual obligation. The 
Pressler amendment was "a veto in the hands of India, a tool and a club 
in the hands of those who stood against America and with the Soviet 
Union for fifty years."

It rewarded "Indian intransigence" and punished "Pakistani loyalty and 
friendship." It must be changed, she said, "so that normal relations 
between our two great countries can be strengthened."

The Prime Minister offered "to go anywhere, at any time" to sign the 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty if her Indian counterpart did the same. 
"I will joyfully agree to a treaty to ban nuclear weapons in South Asia, 
to create a missile-free zone in South Asia, to stop the production of 
fissile material in South Asia, as long as the only proven nuclear power 
on the subcontinent adheres to the same treaties."

Nuclear proliferation she said, was "a regional problem. It demands a 
regional solution."

Implying that Pakistan was a model for other Muslim countries of the 
region, the Prime Minister said the stakes were "terribly high" because 
the world's one billion Muslims were at a cross-roads. They must choose, 
she said, between "tolerance and bigotry, between "technology and 
repression," between "xenophobia and internationalism." Ultimately, they 
must choose "between the past and the future."

Pakistan stood ready, she said, "to assist them in their transition to 
democracy, in their transition to free market economies, in their 
transition into the modern era."

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Masood Haider

NEW YORK, April 7: The New York police intelligence and bomb squad units 
scrambled into action, scouring the John F. Kennedy airport and other 
sites, on reports that a Pakistani-based terrorist group has arrived in 
the city and has threatened Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.

Ms Bhutto was scheduled to arrive here on Friday afternoon.

The New York police department was identifying the so-called terrorist 
group as MQM, which had threatened a suicide attack on the Prime 
Minister.

The New York city radio and television stations have been reporting on 
the incident since early morning.

At around 9:30 am Friday (EST) an ABC programme "live with Kathy Lee" 
was suspended when they received a call from a person identifying 
himself as an "Islamist" told the host of the show that a bomb would go 
off in the studios soon.

It may be pointed out here that many Pakistani opposition groups based 
in New York city have announced plans to demonstrate in front of Waldorf 
Astoria hotel where the Prime Minister and her entourage are staying.

King Hussain of Jordan and Iraq's deputy prime minister Tariq Aziz, have 
also arrived in town to meet United Nations secretary general Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali.

The Pakistani officials in New York were not available for comment as 
they had already left for the airport to receive Ms. Bhutto.

MQM, PPP hold rallies
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Our Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, April 6: The MQM staged its second anti-PPP demonstration on 
Wednesday when it held a rally outside Willard Hotel where Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto and her entourage are staying.

PPP supporters, carrying national and party flags and the Prime 
Minister's photographs, also demonstrated in favour of their leader.

Holding placards, the MQM workers raised slogans denouncing "atrocities" 
by security forces and accusing the PPP government of human right 
violations in Karachi.

This was the second day of MQM demonstrations designed to draw attention 
to "excesses against Mohajirs" in Karachi.

Tomorrow, a recently formed "save Pakistan Committee" intends to hold a 
candle-light vigil outside the residence of the Pakistan ambassador to 
protest against what a Press release called "the genocide" in Karachi.

According to the Press release, the demonstrators will include 
supporters of the MQM, Pakistan Muslim League, Pakistan Association, 
International Mohajir, the Coalition for Concerned Pakistani Americans 
and the Council of Pakistani Organisations.

The committee hopes to maintain the candle-light vigil for three 
evenings in succession. Demonstrations are also planned by PPP 
supporters and anti-PPP organisations in front of the White House on 
April 11 when the Prime Minister is to meet President Clinton.

Mous worth $6bn signed
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi

WASHINGTON, April 7: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said here on Thursday 
that the massive foreign investment flowing into Pakistan represented "a 
fundamental endorsement" of her government's "disciplined macroeconomic 
policy".

This endorsement had come, she said, not merely from the US government 
but, as the prime minister put it, from "the hardest of all nuts to 
crack - corporate America".

Speaking after the Memoranda of Understanding on further US investments 
in Pakistan had been signed at the historic National Building Museum in 
the presence of a large crowd that also witnessed a lively cultural 
show, Ms Bhutto said the two governments had "truly become partners in 
building Pakistan."

The MoUs signed represent a potential US investment of six billion 
dollars in energy infrastructure and energy delivery in Pakistan.

If Ken Brody, chairman of the US Exim Bank, who has the rank of a 
cabinet minister, is included, the glittering ceremony with all the 
media razzmatazz was witnessed by five Clinton cabinet ministers 
Secretaries for Energy, Commerce and Agriculture and US Trade 
Representative Micky Kantor. Also present were executive heads of 62 US 
corporations.

Giving what she called 'an amazing statistic", the prime minister said 
they had signed that evening agreements for "more foreign investment for 
Pakistan than in the full quarter century that preceded my government's 
re-election in 1993". This had brought the total foreign investment to 
Pakistan over the last 17 months to over 20 billion dollars.

The new ventures showed that the two sides had taken "a major step on 
the road to a new Pakistan" which believed in trade not aid partnership, 
not dependence. "I assure you," she said, "that some day you will look 
back to this signing ceremony as the smartest business decision you have 
ever made."

Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary both 
paid tributes to Prime Minister Bhutto's leadership in pursuing economic 
reforms, and said that economy was going to be the new basis of the US-
Pakistan relationship.

Mr Brown said the signing ceremony signified the future growth of 
Pakistan's economy and a foundation upon which to base the bilateral 
relationship.

Ms O'Leary said the investments constituted "an extraordinary tribute" 
to the Pakistani leadership and showed how the US government and 
business had responded "to the call of economic reforms" in Pakistan. 
American businessmen now realised, she said, that "business with 
Pakistan is good business".

60 Mous SIGNED: A total of 60 MoUs were signed last evening, providing 
for US investment in non-energy sectors, including water and 
communication. Among Americans who signed the MoUs were Mr Robert 
McFarland, former national security adviser to president Reagan now 
representing United States Medical International, and Mr John Imle Jr. 
head of the Unocal Corporation.

Mr Salman Farooqi, Secretary for Water and Power, signed a number of 
related MoUs for Pakistan, and said that they constituted American 
companies' "concrete promise to explore for oil, build power plants and 
develop our ports and telecommunications infrastructure".

The agreements constitute the second such event between Pakistan and the 
US last year. During secretary, O'Leary's visit to Pakistan, the two 
sides signed MoUs worth four billion dollars.

The agreements would concretise when international lending agencies come 
up with financing. US Exim Bank has already indicated that it is willing 
to provide funding to US companies interested in investments in 
Pakistan.

Despite the Pressler law, the US companies can invest in Pakistan. But 
they are denied insurance cover, and the interest rates go high.

Special Assistant Shahid Hassan told newsmen that he was confident the 
funding would be forthcoming because Pakistan's economic reforms had won 
wide approval from US public and private sectors. He quoted Exim chief 
as saying he was surprised to see "how well-structured" Pakistan's 
macro-economic policies were.

Currently, he said, there were three aims behind Pakistan's "economic 
diplomacy" to look for finances for the MoUs signed, to sign agreements 
for new projects and to launch a new initiative at Los Angeles where the 
prime minister is to have a meeting with investors on the west coast.

*From  Our Correspondent

LONDON, April 11: Leader of the opposition Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif 
and chief of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement Altaf Hussain had a meeting on 
Tuesday lasting 45 minutes, at which the latest developments in Pakistan 
and in particular in Karachi came under review.

The MQM leader, with some of his close associates, visited the hospital 
where Mr Nawaz Sharif's father is being treated for heart condition. Mr 
Hussain had inquired about him by telephone on Sunday.

Mr Sharif, who had reached an understanding with the MQM leader after 
two days of talks last month, has come to London mainly for his father's 
treatment. He is expected to stay here until Mian Sharif is released 
from  the hospital. He is said to be in a stable condition after 
undergoing angioplasty last week.

An MQM source said no one else was present at the meeting between Mr 
Sharif and Mr Hussain on Tuesday. The two coordinating committees, set 
up by the MQM and the Muslim League following the accord reached between 
their leaders, had begun working and would be monitoring progress in 
achieving cooperation between the two parties, the source said. Mr  
Hussain was concerned over what he called a fresh wave of "state 
oppression" against his party workers, and had drawn Mr Sharif's 
attention to the killings of a number of his party's activists in recent 
days, the source added.

<hr><a name="khat">Fresh poll demand dropped : Opposition opts for no-trust: Khattak
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 9: The opposition does not intend to demand fresh 
elections, and it will, instead, focus its attention on removing the 
present government through a noconfidence motion in the assembly, ANP 
President Senator Ajmal Khattak said here on Sunday.

Talking to newsmen, he said the 'hawks" in the opposition were of the 
view that a no-confidence motion be introduced at the earliest possible 
opportunity. However, he said the opposition would strike at what it 
considered to be the right moment.

The ANP president said removal of the Benazir government was not the 
sole objective before the opposition. The opposition wanted to steer the 
country out of the problems currently besetting it. Thus, although the 
opposition was in a position "to outvote" the Prime Minister, it was 
waiting for a suitable opportunity.

Asked to comment on reports that the opposition did not have a candidate 
as a replacement for Ms Benazir Bhutto the ANP leader said, "We have a 
candidates."

Answering a question about the possibility of cooperation between the 
ANP and the Jamaat-i-Islami, Mr Khattak said his party regarded the 
Jamaat as an effective force whose cooperation was required to clear 
"the prevailing mess."

Answering a question about the Kashmir issue, the ANP president said the 
issue could be resolved through talks between Pakistan and India. He 
said the matter would not he resolved if India continued to describe 
Kashmir as its integral part and Pakistan termed it as its jugular]ill 
vein.

Mr Khattak said Kashmiris should play a pivotal role in solving the 
issue.

Replying to a question, the ANP president claimed that his party was not 
informed by Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan that he planned to hold a 
conference on Kashmir.

It was reported that the ANP had not signed the joint declaration on i 
the Kashmir issue. Answering a question about the Kalabagh dam, Mr 
Khattak said the energy requirements of the country should be met 
without endangering national unity. At present, he said, the NWFP, 
Balochistan and Sindh were opposed to this project Energy needs could be 
met from other sources, but there was no substitute for national unity. 
If the Kalabagh dam was built, it would be simply "disastrous" for 
national unity, creating bitterness among the provinces.

Mr Khattak strongly challenged the suggestions that the parliamentary 
system had failed in the country, and the presidential system should now 
be adopted. He said the presidential system was tried in the past and 
had failed.

Answering another question, the ANP president said his party supported 
the demand for the status of a province for the Saraiki area. As far as 
the Mohajirs were concerned, he said, the ANP was in favour of giving 
them a social, cultural and linguistic status.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 6: A PIA flight carrying opposition leader Nawaz Sharif 
and members of his family was delayed for an hour on Thursday because 
the name of opposition leader's father was on the exit control list, PML 
sources said.

Mohammad Sharif was leaving for London via Manchester for treatment of 
his heart ailment along with his wife, his son Nawaz Sharif, Begum 
Qulsoom Nawaz Sharif and Hasan Nawaz.

The Sharif family had arrived here from Lahore on PK 380 and after 
staying an hour in the VIP lounge embarked on a PIA flight PK-789 for 
London. However, he was told by the Immigration authorities that his 
name was on the exit control list because of cases registered against 
him. He was informed that he would be allowed to proceed only after 
permission was granted from the government.

The airport authorities reportedly contacted senior officials who 
cleared Sharif's name on humanitarian grounds.

The whole process delayed the flight for one hour after which it left 
for Manchester.

The passengers were, however, told that the delay was due to some 
technical problem.

Political analysts said Mr Nawaz Sharif has quietly shifted his entire 
family to London which was an indication that he would now return with 
free hands to launch a movement against the government.

Opposition leader's elder brother Shahbaz Sharif is already living in 
self-exile in London and his son Hussain Nawaz is studying there.

*From  Aziz Malik

HYDERABAD, April 6: A head constable and two constables, Bhittai Nagar 
police were arrest late this evening for having tortured a young man to 
death in custody last night. Some other personnel of the police station 
were suspended.

The action followed a protest demonstration by the residents of Safar 
Sheedi village. The demonstrators, including women and children, marched 
in a procession from the village in Qasimabad carrying the young man's 
body, to Hyderabad Press Club.

Earlier the police had claimed that the man, 25-year-old Mashooq Ali 
Sheedi, had committed suicide.

Mashooq Ali was picked up by Bhittai Nagar Police from Safar Sheedi two 
days back with four other persons, for alleged involvement in some 
robbery case. He was also reportedly wanted by the Qasimabad police in 
some case.

Mashooq was allegedly tortured to death during interrogation by head-
constable Mohammad Khan Lakho and the two constables. Following their 
arrest on the orders of SSP Sardar Abdul Majeed, the police released the 
other four out of apparent panic. It is believed that the four are eye-
witnesses to the torture-killing of Mashooq.

His body was handed over to his relatives after post-mortem examination 
past midnight. In the morning, over 150 people marched to the Press Club 
with the body where journalists and others saw that it bore clear marks 
of torture.

Later, the villagers tried to take the body to Shahbaz building where a 
meeting of the Sindh cabinet was in progress, but the administration 
stopped them.

The deceased was a temporary employee of the Hyderabad Development 
Authority.

KARACHI, April 9: The Milli Yakjehti Council at a meeting of its member 
organisations on Sunday adopted a 17-point code of ethics calling d 
complete ban on the issuance of recriminatory statements and use of 
bandying words at Friday congregations. It also demanded ban on indecent 
graffiti and desecration of worship places in order to get rid of 
sectarianism and to steer out Ummah from the abyss of odium, animosity 
and killings. 

Jamiat Ulema-i-Pakistan chief, Maulana Shah Ahmad Noorani, who is also

The Ulema presented proposals for a unanimous stand by thereligious 
organisations on sectarian and national issues.

The chairman of the reconciliatory committee of the MYC, Liaquat Baloch 
of Jamaat-i-lslami was also present in the meeting. The task the 
committee has laid before it is to lesson the hawkish attitude of "the 
hostile organisations (SSP, TJP and SMP) and to persuade them to sit on 
negotiation table".

The code of ethics is based on the 22-point charter compiled by 31 
leading Ulema of the country in 1951 which formed the basis of the 
Objectives Resolution.

Through a resolution the meeting urged the government to extend material 
support to

Kashmiri freedom fighters and not to cap peaceful nuclear programme.

Cowasjee, Khalid Anwar on behalf of the Editor Ahmed Ali Khan, and 
Makhdoom Ali Khan on behalf of the Printer and Publisher Ghulam Ali 
Mirza.

Senior advocate Sabeehuddin Ahmed appeared for the Pakistan Newspapers 
and Periodicals Organisation (PNPO) requesting the court to make PNPO a 
party to the case as the decision was going to affect a large number of 
its members. His request would be considered later by the court.

The court room was packed to capacity due to the importance of the case. 
Political leaders, human rights activists, senior lawyers, retired civil 
and military officers and a large number of local and foreign 
journalists were present to attend the proceedings.

In his written reply, the advocate for Ahmad Ali Khan informed the court 
that Dawn was an independent newspaper and its policies were determined 
independently by the Editor and his staff. "Its proprietors have never 
sought, and do not seek to cause it to reflect their personal views or 
political predilections," he said.

"It is part of Dawn's editorial policy to allow the widest possible 
latitude and freedom of expression to their journalists and 
correspondents," he said.

It was pointed out in the Editor's statement that said the views 
expressed by Mr Cowasjee, and other columnists, were their own and Dawn 
did not necessarily agree with them. "On the contrary it is an aspect of 
editorial policy to allow the free interplay of opinion for the public 
weal."

When the three-member bench, headed by Justice Fazal Illahi Khan, 
started its proceedings, Mr Sabeehuddin was the first to appear and 
request that the PNPO be made a party to the case. He said that several 
questions of law of public importance would arise in the matter which 
would have a direct bearing on the limits within which the entire Press 
would be entitled to exercise the freedom guaranteed by the 
Constitution. Hence his organisation be made a party to the case.

Justice Fazal Illahi observed that the organisation should have applied 
to the court office. He advised the counsel for the PNPO to submit his 
request to the court office where it would be processed and "will be 
considered later."

At this stage Mr Masroor's counsel, Raja Anwar, pointed out to the court 
that the respondents had still to submit their replies as required under 
the law.

Mr Pirzada informed the court that statements were ready with them and 
supplied the same to the court as well as to the petitioners' counsel.

Justice Munir Ahmad Khan asked about the two separate applications 
attached to the replies. He noted that one of the applications called 
for instituting a full court to hear the case while the other called for 
issuing a notice to the Attorney General.

The counsel for Mr Cowasjee submitted that the request for forming a 
full court had been made because it was for the first time that the 
issue of a fundamental right had been raised in a contempt case.

He said the Press was invoking Article 19 of the Constitution 
guaranteeing the freedom of speech and the Press.

Article 19 relating to fundamental rights says: "Every citizen shall 
have the right to freedom of speech and expression, and there shall be 
freedom of the Press, subject to any reasonable restrictions imposed by 
law in the interest of the glory of Islam or the integrity, security or 
defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, friendly relations with foreign 
states, public order, decency or morality, or in relation to contempt of 
court or incitement to an offence."

He urged that the court should consider reconciling Article 204 of the 
constitution, which empowers the courts to punish on contempt of court, 
with Article 19.

Referring to the request for issuing notice to the Attorney General, Mr 
Pirzada said it was because an allegation had been made in the petition 
about the "instant scandalising of the court" and the Attorney General 
would be in a better position to explain that.

Mr Pirzada also requested the court to club together the petition filed 
by former Editor of Weekly Takbeer, late Maulana Salahuddin, with his 
application.

He said according to his knowledge, the late Maulana Salahuddin had 
filed a contempt of court petition against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto 
in October 1990. He said he had tried to ascertain the position of that 
case from the court office but could not get any information.

"If that case has been disposed of, the decision should be provided to 
us or if it is pending it should be heard along with this application," 
he said.

Justice Fazal Illahi asked him what connection Maulana Salahuddin's 
petition had with the case. Mr Pirzada informed the court that the late 
Salahuddin had filed petition on the basis of a book "Daughter of the 
East" written by Benazir Bhutto and for addressing a seminar presided 
over by Justice (retd) Durab Patel.

Justice Munir said the issue raised by the respondents was a serious 
issue: He said the court would be needing the assistance of a 
constitutional expert like Mr Pirzada in the interpretation of various 
articles of the Constitution.

He said that the proper procedure for the court would be to first issue 
notice to the Attorney General and then sort out other matters. He said 
the petitioner would also be issued notices on these matters.

However, counsel for the Editor Dawn Khalid Anwar, pointed out that the 
job of the petitioner was already over. He said after the issuance of 
notice to the Attorney General, he (Attorney General) would now be 
presumed to be both the complainant and the prosecutor.

Justice Munir agreed that since the court had taken cognizance of the 
contempt, the Attorney General would become the prosecutor.

Khalid Anwar told the court that Pakistan's constitution was distinct 
from  other constitutions in that it specifically recognised the freedom 
of the Press.

"Subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law," Justice Munir 
reminded him.

Agreeing with the judge, Mr Khalid said Article 19 of the Constitution 
separately guaranteed the right of Press freedom. He said Press was a 
conglomeration of individuals and this fundamental right had been given 
independently to them.

"And subject to all reasonable limitations," Justice Munir again 
reminded him.

Khalid Anwar said the PNPO should be made a party to the case as it was 
a representative body of the newspapers and periodicals and entitled to 
plead its case.

He also supported Mr Pirzada's plea that a full court should be 
constituted for hearing this case. He said the aspect of fundamental 
rights had never been touched in such cases in the past. "We have to see 
and determine how this fundamental right inter-acts with the rights and 
dignity of the court," he said.

Mr Khalid said the power of the judiciary was actually derived from the 
power of the people while the Press was considered to be a watch-dog of 
the interests of the people.

The petitioner's counsel, Raja Anwar replying to the points raised by 
the counsel for the respondents, said the request for the formation of a 
full court was only a delaying tactic.

Raja Anwar also opposed the application filed by Mr Pirzada for issuing 
a notice to the Attorney General. He said as soon as the contempt 
proceedings were initiated by the court, a notice was automatically sent 
to the Attorney General's office informing him about the proceedings. 
"Then the Attorney General becomes the prosecutor."

Raja Anwar said about the respondent columnist: "Here is a man who is in 
the habit of scandalising the courts." He said the judges were not in a 
position to reply to the allegations made against them in the Press.

Raja Anwar said contempt of court had become very common and requested 
the court to decide the issue for all times to come. He also disagreed 
that a full court had never heard such a case in the past and referred 
to the Fakr Alam case which was heard by a full court.

Mr Pirzada took strong exception to the charges levelled by Raja Anwar 
against his client and said he was never afraid of early hearing and was 
ready to plead the case before a full court as and when it was formed.

Similarly, he also objected to the remarks made by Mr Anwar that his 
client had been scandalising the courts during the last 10 years. "I 
take serious exception to the charge that we are using delaying tactics 
or that we have been scandalising the courts," Mr Pirzada said.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Our Correspondent

MUZAFFARABAD, April 11: Different mujahideen groups fighting Indian rule 
in held Kashmir may opt to form a united Muslim army to combat occupant 
forces effectively and efforts in this connection have entered in a 
decisive phase, Dawn learnt from reliable sources on Tuesday.

The need of such force, said the sources, had been felt for quite some 
time but could not be materialised due to reported differences among 
various groups. With the rising possibilities of liberation of Kashmir 
from  India at global level, chances of joint army of mujahideen have 
brightened up.

Another reason behind the decision to launch a combined Muslim force was 
to avert Afghanistan-like situation in the held Kashmir in future, 
sources said.

The joint force namely Muslim malitia force was likely to be formed 
shortly after the merger of small militant outfits at the initial stage 
and later, of major groups into the military.

The Muslim militia, the sources added, would operate against Indian army 
under one banner moto and a single command. Moreover its soldiers would 
be equipped with necessary combat training, they claimed.   

According to these sources, contacts among leaders of various militant 
organisations have intensified and majority of them have given their 
consent for the formation of the proposed militia.

It was also learnt that the largest pro-Pakistan militant organisation, 
operating against Indian forces, has also offered voluntarily to give up 
its name, paving way for the "greater cause".

NWFP government which is impeding an important health project.

The inter-departmental row has affected utilisation of a grant-inaid

The period for utilisation of the grant expired on March 31, but Tokyo

LAHORE, April 7: The Punjab cabinet meeting on Thursday is understood to 
have ended in a stalemate as neither the disputes on the MPAs demand of 
quotas for recruitments could be agreed upon nor the new law on the 
future local government system in the province was allowed to be 
presented.

The PPP members of the cabinet, who held a separate session prior to the 
cabinet meeting, reportedly felt amazed as to why "an indecent haste" 
was being exercised in pushing through both the important matters at a 
time when the prime minister and the Punjab governor were out of the 
country.

The ground realities appear to have made the government's "challenging" 
task of filling as many as 42,000 vacancies in Grades 1 to 16 in 
different provincial departments by the stipulated day, April 15, almost 
impossible. The government, many believe, will have to grant another 
extension in the last date for the recruitment process to complete. An 
important factor for the extension is that many in the government, 
particularly the interested parties, will be busy in the by- election in 
Muzaffargarh which is incidentally falling on the same day which is the 
last date for completing of the recruitment process.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Anjum Niaz

ISLAMABAD, April 6: With the first round of Pakistan-Afghan transit 
trade talks having yielded positive results, official sources said here 
on Thursday that the next round scheduled for the first half of May is 
expected to see an agreement signed by Islamabad and Kabul on a latent 
but recently turned thorny issue.

"This round has helped in narrowing differences in perception and we are 
now closer to an agreement," an official source told Dawn while 
admitting that some unpalatable facts during private conversations came 
to the fore exposing Pakistan and Afghanistan's "culpability" in certain 
areas. 

The five-member Afghan delegation is said to have apprised the Pakistani 
side about the huge sums of money the Afghan traders have to give as 
"illegal gratification" to the Pakistan customs.

Taking Pakistan to task for its "inaction" against such institutions 
guilty of misuse and misconduct in the "reverse flow" of goods smuggled 
back from Afghanistan into Pakistan, official sources said that while 
the Afghans recognise the "injury" termed by Central Board of Revenue 
(CBR) as economic aggression by its neighbour, the Afghan delegation 
said it was prepared to cooperate with Pakistan in taking joint measures 
to nab the people involved in smuggling and illegal gratification 
through foolproof monitoring and updated data.

The Afghans also raised the issue of an alternative transport system for 
their goods.

Pointing out defects in the transit trade facility, Pakistan also 
pinpointed certain areas which were suffering due to smuggling: "The 
transit trade has already crossed the 300 million dollar mark this year, 
while officially it is 300 million dollars due to under-invoicing, the 
actual amount comes to around 600-700 million dollars which is affecting 
our industry here," said sources citing the recent shutting down of Sony 
spark plugs factory.

An unidentified bullet-riddled body was found at an isolated place in 
Shadman Town in Malir.

SUKKUR, April 6: The government plans to privatise the distribution 
system of irrigation water  to curb irregularities and malpractice and 
to stop wastage, Dawn learnt on Thursday.  The irrigation water supplied  
*from  Tarbela dam was not equitably distributed, a big amount of  water 
is wasted and the big land lords obtain its lion's share due to their 
influence while the small  landlords and the growers, especially those 
at the tail-end of the canals, do not receive their due  share of water.   
This irregular supply not only affected the small growers but the 
agricultural produce was also  adversely affected.   To eliminate the 
irregularities, the government has planned to privatise the irrigation 
water. The  landlords and the peasants would have to pay the cost of 
water proportionate to their consumption.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, April 12: Gordon Wu, business tycoon of Hong Kong, will 
develop a port at Kati Bander with an estimated cost of $100 million for 
the import of coal, official sources told the 'Dawn'.

Consolidated Electric Power Asia (CEPA), a company owned by Gordon Wu, 
in its recent talks with the Private Power and Infrastructure Board 
(PPIB) had agreed to develop the port. Earlier CEPA was not ready to 
install its proposed power plant of 5,280 mw at Kati Bander.

The CEPA, before construction of the power plant, will dig a channel in 
the marshy land of the proposed site for the ships importing coal, the 
source said.

According to the understanding reached at between the PPIB and CEPA the 
former, besides establishing port will also contribute in the extraction 
of the Thar coal reserves. The Sindh government as part of the agreement 
is obliged to lay a metalled road upto Kati Bander, the source said.

The CEPA, as per understanding would initially set up two power 
generating units which would be operated by the imported coal. These 
units after the development of the Thar coal mines would be switched to 
the domestic coal.

However the government is yet to conduct a study to ascertain the 
quality of over 180 billion tonnes coal reserves at Thar and the cost 
required for its extraction, the source added.

Earlier, the CEPA had been insisting that it should be allowed to run 
the proposed power plant on the imported coal. The selection of the site 
earlier, had been another issue which created doubts about the 
implementation of $7.9 billion investment pledged by Gordon Wu.

The CEPA after a brief survey of the Sindh province chose the site of 
Mubarakpur for installation of the power plant, wherein the provincial 
government wanted it to be established somewhere in the interior or near 
Thar. Eventually the CEPA agreed to set it up at Kati Bander where water 
is available in abundance to cool the plant.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, April 10: The federal government is understood to have decided 
"in principle" to restore trade union activities in most of the 
departments where collective bargaining is presently banned under the 
Pakistan Essential Services Act.

The lifting of ban is said to be part of the government's labour policy 
which is likely to be announced as a May Day gift for the working 
classes.

The Civil Aviation Authority, Pakistan Television, the Pakistan 
Broadcasting Corporation, Pakistan Security Printing Corporation, 
Pakistan Security Papers, PCSIR Laboratories, National Logistics Cell, 
hospitals and the Pakistan Ordnance Factory are among those 
organisations where trade union rights may be restored.

The departments where the ban will continue to exist include the police 
and the armed forces. In this regard the Essential Services Act, enacted 
in the early 1950s, will have to be drastically amended.

The scope of the Act was expanded between 1985 and 1993 to include many 
departments besides the ones originally covered by it. Thus a complete 
or partial ban on trade union activities was imposed on the open-line 
establishments of the Pakistan Railways, WAPDA, Karachi Port Trust, Oil 
and Gas Development Corporation, Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation, 
certain educational institutions and export processing zones.

The proposed labour policy and the amendment in the Act are expected to 
be placed before the federal cabinet.

Restoration of trade union rights in these departments, repeal of the 
Pakistan Essential Services Act and bringing all labour laws in 
conformity with the ILO Conventions has been repeatedly agitated by the 
ILO's governing body during its sessions at Geneva for over two decades. 
Every time the government representative held out a "solemn pledge" that 
the labour situation would be improved. On a number of occasions 
Pakistan has been blacklisted by the ILO for not honouring the 
commitment.

<hr><a name="22bn">Consortium meets on 20th : Pakistan to seek $2.2bn for 95-96
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 6: Pakistan has sought 2.2 billion dollars from the Aid 
to Pakistan Consortium for the financial year 1995- 96, admitting that 
the growth remained depressed, inflation accelerated and budgetary 
performance was below expectation during 1994-95.

The Planning Commission and the Economic Affairs Division have jointly 
prepared a "Memorandum for the Pakistan Consortium 1995-96" to be 
presented in the Paris club meeting scheduled for April 20 and 21.

"We are seeking 2.5 billion dollars from the Aid-to-Pakistan 
consortium," Deputy Chairman of Planning Commission Kazi Alimullah told 
Dawn here on Thursday.

Based on current estimates, Pakistan expects total official commitments 
of 2.6 billion dollars (exactly $ 2,620 million) in 1995-96 including 
2.2 billion from the consortium, 278 million from non-consortium and 45 
million dollars as relief assistance for refugees. Gross official 
disbursements during the next fiscal are projected as 2.5 billion 
dollars of which project aid disbursement from pipeline and fresh 
commitments will aggregate 2.1 billion dollars. Disbursement of non-
project aid from the pipeline and new commitments were projected at 305 
million dollars of which 200 million dollars will be food assistance and 
the balance of 105 million dollars reflects disbursement from different 
sector loans and commodity type assistance.

The year 1995-96 is projected to close with current account deficit of 
the order of 2.4 billion dollars ($2414 million). In addition, 1.5 
billion dollars will be needed for amortisation. With the envisaged 
build up of foreign exchange reserves of 521 million dollars, the total 
foreign capital requirements for the next fiscal would amount to 4.5 
billion dollars.

According to the memorandum prepared for the consortium, the GDP growth 
could not catch up due to the continued cotton crisis. Inflation soared 
due to supply shortages, and revenues faced shortfall on account of 
adjustments in taxation structure during the current financial year.

The GDP was planned to grow by 6.9 per cent during 1994- 95. But the 
excessive rains, followed by floods, severely damaged the Kharif crops, 
and as a result the output of cotton was only 7.5 million bales against 
the target of 9.6 million bales. The overall impact of the losses in 
agriculture is likely to slash the growth in agriculture sector from the 
planned 8 per cent to 3.7 per cent.

However, it said that significant improvements were registered in fiscal 
deficit during 1993-94 as the overall deficit was brought down to 5.8 
per cent of the GDP. For 1994-95, it was targeted at 4 per cent of the 
GDP. The present fiscal position indicates considerable improvement 
though not to the extent programmed. Tax collection under principal 
heads during July-February 1994-95 recorded increase of about 24 per 
cent over the corresponding period last year.

The process of structural reforms aimed at deregulation privatisation 
and liberalisation of the economy continued during the year. The 
privatisation of public sector enterprises remained in progress. 
Policies were advanced to improve the investment climate of the country 
and to bring in foreign private investment.

About the outlook for 1995-96, it is anticipated the balance of payments 
will improve moderately, exclusively because of improvements in trade 
balance. Exports (fob) are forecast to increase by 15.1 per cent to 8.9 
billion dollars to be contributed by increases both in volume and 
prices. Exports of raw cotton is expected to see a reversal of the 
existing situation in anticipation of recovery of cotton crop. The 
export of cotton manufacturers are forecast to grow by 13.5 per cent in 
dollars term. With the quota restrictions under MFA being phased out to 
the extent of 16 per cent from July 1,1995, as per agreed in the Uruguay 
Round, a large textile export market is likely to become available. It 
is also expected that other traditional items, including fish and fish 
preparations, leather, carpets and synthetic textiles will register a 
growth of 10 per cent compared to a smaller growth of 2.3 per cent in 
1994-95.

Imports (fob) are projected to increase by 7.9 per cent to 10 billion 
dollars ($10605 million), of which 15 per cent will be contributed by 
crude oil and POL products, 53 per cent by private sector imports and 8 
per cent by two major items namely wheat and edible oils. There is a 
provision of 1.4 million tons of wheat imports at a total cost of 200 
million dollars.

Workers' remittances are expected to increase by 2.4 per cent to 1.8 
billion dollars ($1843 million) in 1995-96. With the invisible payments 
rising to 4.9 billion dollars by 8.9 per cent, the invisibles account is 
anticipated to be in deficit of the order of 716 million dollars in 
199596, indicating a deficit of over 60 per cent. On the basis of trade 
and invisibles projections, the current account deficit is expected to 
decline to 2.4 billion dollars ($2414 million) which is 3.7 per cent of 
the GDP.

Gross disbursements of official assistance are expected to be of the 
order of 2.5 billion ($2535 million) in 1995-96, lower by 100 million 
dollars than the preceding year. While disbursements under project aid 
are expected to increase, those under commodity aid and food aid are 
envisaged to decline. An amount of 1.8 billion is expected under foreign 
private investment. After allowing for other capital movements, the 
overall balance of payments is expected to record a surplus of 489 
million dollars. Taking into account the net position with IMF and other 
transactions of the banking system for the year 1995-96, a reserve build 
up of 521 million dollars is expected to take place by June 1996.

*From  Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, April 6: The tax revenue receipts totalled Rs 152 billion in 
the first three quarters (July-March) of the year, leaving for the 
Central Board of Revenue the formidable task of bagging Rs 88 billion by 
the end of June in order to come at par with the revised annual target 
of Rs 240 billion.

*From  Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 10: China has expressed its willingness to help set up 
2.5 billion dollars Ghazi Brotha dam by providing substantial supplier's 
credit and transfer of technology.

Mohammad Asghar, minister for industries and production told DAWN here 
on Monday that the Chinese have assured him that they were ready to 
cooperate with the Pakistan authorities for providing their "latest 
technology" particularly to develop Ghazi Brotha Hydro-electric power 
station.

"The visiting high-powered delegation, which met me today, also give an 
assurance on extending maximum cooperation for the indiginisation of the 
Ghazi Brotha," he added.

The World Bank has also supported the construction of 1750 mw Ghazi 
Brotha project and is expected to arrange a consortium of foreign banks 
to finance the funding of  2.5 billion dollars.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, April 6: Zamindars in Sindh have paid hardly Rs 200,000 (Rs 2 
lakh) tax on their agricultural income as the current fiscal year 
approaches its fag end against the provincial government's collection 
estimate of Rs 10 million for the whole fiscal 1994-95.

Tax collectors expect a total collection of hardly Rs 1 million at the 
end of 1994-95 even if the Sindh Government starts a campaign to recover 
the tax levied for the first time in the history on the agriculturists.

Agricultural income tax is being collected by the Board of Revenue or 
Revenue Department of Sindh through Deputy Commissioners in the district 
where forms are still being despatched. Under the law, the tax is being 
charged at Rs 2 per production index unit on land which is in excess of 
4,000 index units. Those having 4,000 index on its of land are exempted 
from  tax as their income is assumed to be less than Rs 40,000 which is 
the exemption limit for tax in the urban centres.

While the collection of tax on agricultural income remains a big 
unsolved question, the Sindh Government officials boast of having 
exceeded the proportionate target of overall collection of taxes.

Sindh government fixed collection of Rs. 2.62 billion from the 
provincial taxes in the whole 1994-95 and proportionate target for eight 
months (July 1994 to February 1995 ) comes to about Rs 1.75 billion 
against which the actual collection has been about Rs 2 billion which is 
115 per cent.

A distinct feature has been 691 percent increase in Property Tax 
collection amounting to about Rs 250 million. This tax is mainly 
collected from the urban centres and despite serious lawlessness 
property holders in Karachi contributed the bulk of the amount.

In non-tax revenue generation the total collection in eight months 
amounting to about Rs 1 billion is within sight of the target as the 
total estimate for the entire 1994-95 fiscal is about Rs.1.50 billion.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ahmad Hsssan Alvi

RAWALPINDI, April 6: There are 28000 defaulters in the country with 
total unpaid banks loans amounting Rs 80.5 billion, a seminar was told 
here.

The figures were mentioned by chief guest Shameem Ahmed, President 
Askari Commercial Bank while inaugurating the seminar on "Problem Loans: 
Causes, Remedies and Recovery" here at a local hotel on Wednesday.

The seminar was also addressed by Mr Muhammad Bari, Chief Manager, State 
Bank of Pakistan and Mr M.M. Malik Chief Executive/ Secretary IBP.

Shameem Ahmad said that it was an admitted position, the effects of non 
-performing loans on the profitability of banks or DFIs could be 
devastating. He agreed that the losses stemming from non-performing 
loans were, in many cases more severe than those resulting from the 
activities of dacoits, and from armed hold-ups.

Shameen Ahmed suggested since the credit risks could be professionally 
identified, therefore, lending authorities must concentrate on 
visualising and assessing these risks and devising ways to cover 
themselves against potential losses.

<hr><a name="inve">Needed: investment friendly laws
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By R.M.U. Suleman

ACCORDING to recent reports, the World Bank may link its financial 
assistance to Pakistan with the implementation of the long over-due 
judicial reforms. These reforms are envisaged to include the appointment 
of quality judges and judicial independence with a view to restoring 
foreign investors' confidence in Pakistan's courts.

The ground for sound judicial reforms is being paved by arranging a 
workshop on the subject under the asupices of the World Bank. This 
workshop will be held in Pakistan in September 1995 in cooperation with 
the Pakistan Supreme Court.

The proposed agenda for the workshop is quite indicative and includes 
the requisite qualities of a modern judge, judicial independence, and 
judicial reform with a lending agency perspective. Special attention is 
being paid to the credentials of the participants. Retired judges 
enjoying the reputation of integrity, independent and respected lawyers, 
representatives of the business community, academics, serious 
legislators, leading human rights activists and seasoned journalists 
will be invited. Lawyers with clear association with a political party 
will not be invited.

The World Bank officials have made it clear that in case of any 
alteration in the participants' list, the Bank may back out of its 
commitment. Though the complete list of participants is not yet 
available, it is not yet clear who will represent the business 
community. With the removal of office-bearers of the Federation of 
Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the organisers may face 
difficulties in finding the representatives of businessmen.

If the recommendations of the workshop are implemented, it is believed, 
the atmosphere for foreign investment is likely to improve. It may be 
mentioned that World Bank has also offered such the legal technical 
assistance to other countries including Bangladesh, India, Argentina, 
China, Egypt, Indonesia and Bolivia.

The projected workshop has by no means come too soon, since our legal 
institutions are in crisis due partly to their gradual loss of social 
relevance. Our laws have become negotiable. Bribery and corruption are 
characteristic results of such a legal system in which competing for 
unearned income has become the predominant form of lawmaking.

<hr><a name="proj">Rs 452bn investment during 1995-96 projected
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 8: The government has projected an all time enhanced 
investment of Rs 452.9 billion for the fiscal year 1995-96, 20.5 per 
cent higher than the current year's assessed investment of Rs 375.8 
billion.

Official sources told Dawn here on Saturday, the Planning Commission has 
firmed up the investment projections keeping in view the current 
favourable trend both in and outside Pakistan. It was said that the 
private sector has particularly been encouraged to invest and given 
legal assurances of its investment.   

Sources said investment of Rs 452.9 billion will be made by both the 
public and the private sector of Pakistan and that foreign investment 
will be in addition to these local projections.

According to a "Memorandum for the Aid-to-Pakistan Consortium 1995-96 " 
as a proportion to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the investment level is 
forecast to reach 21.1 per cent against last year's level of 20.4 per 
cent. About 54.4 per cent of the fixed investment is expected to be in 
the private sector.

While the highest priorities in the public sector would continue to be 
enjoyed by power, transport, communications and social sectors, the 
major share of investment in the private sector will be claimed by 
manufacturing, housing and agriculture sectors. For the promotion of 
investment in agriculture, a reform package announced last year 
envisaging the introduction of People's Tractor Scheme, reduction of 
import duties on agriculture machinery and increase in allocation of 
agriculture loan, would be implemented effectively.

<hr><a name="gdpg">Lenders being informed : GDP growth rate scaled down to 6.5%
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 9: The poor performance of the economy during the first 
two years of the current Eighth-Five-Year Plan has forced the government 
to project lower GDP growth rate of 6.5 percent during the next 
financial year, about which the international lenders are being informed 
at a Consortium meeting scheduled for April 20 and 21.

Official sources told Dawn here on Sunday the latest picture of the 
economy in its totality will be presented to the Aid-to-Pakistan 
consortium to enable the Paris Club to appreciate Pakistan's substantial 
aid request for 1995-96.

The government had envisaged 7.5 percent Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
growth rate for the current fiscal, which the officials said was not 
only too ambitious but went further out of reach because of reversals in 
the agricultural sector due to bad weather. And this has caused the 
government to scale down the growth projections for the next year 
substantially compared to the original target of current budget.

The GDP growth rate in Pakistan is constantly on the decline 
particularly for the last few years and reasons are mainly attributed to 
bad cotton crop and devastating floods that hit the country terribly 
specially in 1992-93 when the CDP growth rate fell to all time low of 
3.6 percent.

The Annual Plan 1995-96 is being conceived keeping the performance of 
the economy over the past two years and the major objectives and 
strategies of the Eight Plan. While lower growth rate of 6.5 percent is 
forecast for the next fiscal, the major contribution to growth is 
expected from recovery in the output of major crops (specially cotton 
and rice), additional capacity in manufacturing and power sectors and 
revival of manufactured goods exports.

The GDP growth target of 6.5 percent will be supported by a 6.3 percent 
growth in agriculture, 6.7 percent in manufacturing and ti.6 percent in 
other sectors.

The agriculture sector after an estimated growth rate of 3.7 percent in 
1994-95 is forecast to attain a growth rate of 6.3 percent during next 
financial year. The major crops are forecast to grow by 8.1 percent as 
compared to an estimated growth of 2.5 percent during the current year. 
This increase is however, subject to cotton output of 9.5 million bales. 
The output of minor crops is forecast to increase by 4 percent, 
livestock by 5.5 percent and fishing and forestry together by 5.6 
percent.

For the development of agriculture sector in general and the attainment 
of output targets in particular, comprehensive 12 point agriculture 
reforms package approved last year is being implemented. In addition, an 
output package comprising 2.4 million nutrient tonnes of fertiliser, 217 
thousand tonnes of improved seeds, 131 million acre teet of water and 
adequate availability of credit will be ensured.

With regard to manufacturing, the annual plan 1995-96 is being conceived 
to provide adequately for the removal of constrains currently faced by 
this sector. In anticipation of additional capacities, efficient use of 
existing capacities and revival of domestic and external demands, the 
output or large scale manufacturing is projected to grow by 6.7 percent 
during 1995-96.

The growth forecast for mining sector is placed at 7.2 percent. The 
projected growth is mainly premised on 18.7 percent and 16.7 percent 
likely increase in the extraction of natural gas and coal respectively. 
The major portion of the additional demand for coal is expected to 
emanate from power plants. Though a few wells become operational, no 
increase is expected in oil extraction in view of natural decline in the 
northern fields.

The electricity generation capacity during 1995-96 is projected to be 
increased by 556 mw due to new investment in the energy sector. The 
projected growth rate in this sector is 9.6 percent.

The other sectors comprising services are forecast to grow by 6.2 
percent during the next financial year. And this growth is likely to 
stem mainly from trade and transport and communication sectors.

Though the delegation did not clearly express its dissatisfaction over

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Tahir Mirza

LAHORE: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has done well to recall a bit of 
the history of Pakistan-US relations. Unfortunately, she has done so in 
a context which many Pakistanis find unacceptable.

Speaking at the Johns Hopkins University on Monday during her current 
tour of the US, Ms Bhutto recounted Pakistan's steadfast support for 
Washington, including Islamabad's willingness to allow Pakistani 
territory to be used for spying missions over the then Soviet Union. She 
was referring, of course, to the U-2 incident of May 1, 1960, when US 
pilot Gary Powers was shot down over the USSR while on a mission flown 
from  an American base at Badaber near Peshawar.

However, the prime minister cited the incident, with Pakistan's backing 
of the war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, to make the point 
that while Pakistan had done its best for the US and remained part of 
the fight against communism, it had been unfairly treated by Washington. 
In other words, she was saying, abjectly, many would think, that we have 
done so much for you, been so loyal to you, so you must help us.

There is implicit approval in her remarks of the relationship of 
dependence on and fealty to the US. She has, thus, foreclosed the 
possibility of using the U-2 incident and all the other instances of 
Pakistani involvement with US interests in the region to counter the 
lobby here which has been crying itself hoarse about a sell-out to 
America.

When weren't Pakistani national interests mortgaged to US strategic 
concerns, Ms Bhutto could have asked this lobby. What's new that I am 
doing, which your mentors almost right from the inception of Pakistan 
hadn't done, she could have argued with this group of self-styled 
nationalists who didn't raise a squeak when military bases were being 
established on Pakistani soil. Where were you when Pakistan was taken 
first into the Baghdad Pact and then into Seato in the 50s, should have 
been her inquiry of these modern day Pakistani Columbuses who appear to 
have discovered America only now.

For four decades and more, we have been American supporters. Our 
relationship was an indepth one, so much so that under the mutual 
security and military assistance agreements, our governments were 
prepared to round up elements here which were considered by the CIA to 
be anti-American. According to the terms of the Seato agreement, we were 
supposed to supply lists of politically undesirable people to the 
Americans. We had food aid gifts from the US with the famous handshake 
mark and the words 'Thank you, America'; at least the MoU documents do 
not carry such humiliating inscriptions. We had USAID here and the 
United States military observer group. Even as late as the Bangladesh 
crisis, we were all waiting for the US Sixth Fleet to come to our 
rescue. The American war against communism was our wara widely held 
belief in both government and Islamist circles --- which finally led us 
into the Afghan conflict and resulted in a six year economic and 
military cooperation between the Zia regime and Washington.

None of those who are now so vocal about dependence on the US protested 
against how grossly our national interests were being made subservient 
to American interests. Those who did protest were officially branded as 
anti-national and communist, charges which today's anti-Americans 
vociferously repeated. If kow-towing to America is wrong now, it was 
wrong then. Perhaps more so then because at that time there was greater 
room for manoeuvrability and to follow a more independent policy. With 
the USSR gone, Third World governments, unless they are ready to 
sacrifice, now have no option at all. But, ah, the present-day 
nationalists and patriots will say, we had at least an ideological 
kinship with the United States in those days. That's gone, so why cosy 
up to the Americans now? Now they are ideologically pitted against us.

Ideologically pitted against whom? The Nawaz Muslim League, the Jamaat-
i-Islami, the custodians of our territorial and ideological frontiers? 
That should be good enough only for a laugh. Will everything be 
ideologically correct if we get our F-16s and if the Pressler amendment 
is abolished or bypassed? Every US administration, even administrations 
considered most friendly to Pakistan, have maintained that they look at 
India as the senior and dominant country of South Asia. Would that 
American perception change if we begin to receive fresh economic and 
military aid?

So, poor prime minister, by her remarks at Johns Hopkins designed to 
appease the Americans, has missed the opportunity of telling her 
domestic critics that she is merely following in the illustrious 
footsteps of her predecessors all of whom wanted to ingratiate 
themselves with the Americans. Maybe they got a little more in return 
than Ms Bhutto might, but that's about the only difference there is, and 
help us God.

<hr><a name="arde">A laugh at our own expense
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

WHEN the weak and the cowardly cannot find fault with what a man writes, 
or when they are partisans of an angry government, or when they have 
their own personal little axes to grind, they attack the person of the 
writer and they impute motives, they resort to the old tried trick of 
argumentum ad hominem.

Mr Iftikhar Ahmed of Lahore wrote to The Nation on March 23 and his 
letter was published on April Fool's Day. Mr Iftikhar Ahmed of Karachi 
sent the same letter to DAWN and it was published in this newspaper on 
April 4. quote:"

Just because a former prime minister decided to do the right thing by 
sending him to prison for 72 days (it is a pity it was so short) for his 
writings against the Father of the Nation, he has become an arch-enemy 
of the Bhutto family....."

Mr Ahmed further stated that for long he had been expecting a contempt 
notice to be served upon me.

Mohammed Ali Jinnah is the only leader of our country for whom I have 
any respect, and with the passage of time I marvel more and more at his 
prescience. Each successive government of Pakistan, he predicted, will 
be worse than its predecessor. Never have I either said or written a 
word that could be deemed derogatory to his memory.

Away from the subject of contempt, to jail in Bhutto's days, to the 
political prisoners' block of Karachi Central Prison. In the Year of the 
Lord 1976 I found myself incarcerated with a group of much younger men. 
Most respectfully, each in turn asked me why I had been punished. When I 
told them that I had no idea, the common answer was that I must then be 
Bhutto's friend.

They all spoke of their various experiences, some had managed to get 
bail and be released, but whilst crossing the road outside the jail gate 
had been re-arrested on different charges and had found themselves back 
in their cell within half an hour. Their advice: do not go to court 
because Bhutto will play with you a cat and mouse game. This  proved to 
be correct.

Within ten days or so of my having been picked up, Bhutto's wily 
provincial home secretary, Mohammed Khan Junejo, inquired of G.M. 
Qureshi, our family lawyer, as to why his client was not moving the 
court. Good Sindhi, Dingomal had trained GM, reacted in the good old 
Sindhi way. He told Junejo that the Cowasjees and Bhuttos had been great 
friends for a long time, that I somehow had angered Bhutto, who had 
reacted out of pique, and that soon he would relent and I would be 
released. This was conveyed to Mr Bhutto and it pleased him.

Thereafter my father started writing to him, very regularly, seeking an 
appointment. On the 71st day of my incarceration, when Bhutto had 
decided to release me, he sent for my father. My wife, who had been with 
Bhutto at the Cathedral High School in Bombay, accompanied my father to 
Rawalpindi the next day. When they arrived at his secretariat, Bhutto 
undoubtedly feeling that he could not look her in the eye, asked that 
she be kept in the waiting room whilst my father was asked in.

As he entered, Bhutto opened up by saying that he only had two minutes 
for him. My father's answer was that he needed only one, as all he 
wanted was his son's release. At that, Bhutto asked him to sit and made 
him suffer a one and a half-hour's harangue. His theme was that history 
would record that he was the best leader this country had ever had. My 
father nodded and agreed. Bhutto felt it was without conviction and said 
so. 'I will sign any statement you want which you can publish, put me on 
TV and I will say whatever pleases you, but just release my son." said 
my father.

Bhutto finally relented and rang up acting chief minister of Sindh Abdul 
Waheed Katpar (Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi was out of the country, honeymooning 
somewhere), told him that Rustom was sitting before him, and that his 
son should be released after being given a stern warning "not do it 
again".

Clueless Katpar had no idea as to who Rustom or his son were, but he 
immediately rang the more knowledgeable Junejo, told him to have the son 
brought to his house that evening where he would be warned and 
thereafter released.

I found Katpar in his house, sitting like his master, on a sofa next to 
a corner table loaded with a mock Chinese vase-lamp and a full battery 
of green, red, black and white telephones. Throughout our conversation, 
telephones rang non-stop. It being impossible to guess which one was 
ringing, Clueless Katpar spent much of the time picking up telephone 
after telephone and yelling a frantic "hello, hello" into each 
mouthpiece.

Thinking I knew no Urdu, he beckoned me to sit on the adjoining sofa. 
"Tek seet," he said, then very pompously informed me that our worthy, 
honourable, distinguished, brilliant and unmatchable prime minister had 
ordered that I be released and warned "not to do it again". I naturally 
asked what "it" was.

"Are you suggesting you don't know?", asked Katpar. "I am saying that I 
don't know," I answered, "I still have no idea why I was jailed". He 
asked how it was possible that I was arrested without knowing why. I 
suggested he ask Junejo, who was quietly sitting by, gazing thoughtfully 
at the chandelier. Presuming that I knew no Sindhi, Katpar asked him 
what crime I had committed. Junejo informed him that his lips were 
sealed. Exasperated, Katpar sent Junejo home. When we were alone, the 
honourable chief minister pleaded with folded hands to me, the prisoner. 
"Cowasjee Sahib, you know our prime minister better than I do. The green 
phone will ring at any moment and he will ask me whether I have warned 
you. When I say, yes, he will ask exactly what it was that I warned you 
not to do again." 

Apprehending that in his confusion Katpar may send me back to jail, I 
said, "Minister, I believe you are a lawyer," whereupon he ordered tea. 
I then elaborated, saying that I had heard he was a very eminent lawyer. 
Katpar ordered cakes and biscuits.

I told him that though not a lawyer myself, I knew enough law to realise 
that if I had committed a crime I must either apologise or be prepared 
to suffer the punishment. Wishing to be neither a martyr, nor a hero, 
nor a shaheed, merely wanting to go home, I was willing to apologise for 
any crime I was charged with filching a buffalo, burning a bus, inciting 
a riot, I would admit to any thing reasonable and apologise.

There was prolonged silence. Tea was drunk, biscuits were munched. I 
then suggested he release me and hasten off on a tour of his province 
during which time the great man would surely forget me. He leapt at the 
suggestion, saw me out to my car, bid me a fond farewell, and home I 
went.

When I arrived, I found on my father's table a file of copies of the 
letters he had written to Bhutto requesting my release. They all opened 
with the salutation "Most Respected Prime Minister Sahib Jenab Zulfikar 
Ali Bhutto Mehrban". I asked my father why he had written like a 
station-master.

Apparently, whilst writing his first letter with the normal opening, 
"Dear Prime Minister", a friend had come into the room and seeing what 
he had written reacted by telling him that the great man would not 
appreciate a simple salutation. "Respected Prime Minister" would be far 
safer. Shortly thereafter a second friend arrived and recommended adding 
"Most". A third informed him that "Sahib" and "Jenab" were a must. GM 
said "Mehrban" would please Bhutto, and so it went until he arrived at a 
salutation satisfactory to all.

Why had he felt it necessary to grovel? I asked. He told me to wait 
until I lived to be 75, to find my son of 50 in jail for no fault of 
his, to know neither what he was there for nor when he would come out, 
to witness the distress of his mother day in and day out, and I would 
then realise why he had written as he had. "Maara dikra, wakhat aavey 
tiare gadhera ne be baap kehwo paddey."

All this may seem laughable in retrospect but in those days of the First 
(and hopefully last) of the civilian dictators it was all very 
unnerving, particularly for my aged parents.

Finally, to my old friend the Jadoogar of Jeddah upon whom, together 
with me, correspondent to the Press, Iftikhar Ahmed has vented his 
scorn, accusing me of having "stooped so low as to engage the Jadoogar 
to perform his jadoo for my benefit". To even begin to remotely 
comprehend - my 30-year-old friendship with the Jadoogar Mr Ahmed will 
have to have lived out the Biblical span allotted to us all, to have a 
sense of humour and, above all, be capable of laughing at himself.

<hr><a name="khal">Impressions about India
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Gen (retd) Khalid Mahmud Arif

A FEW days spent in India in January and March this year helped in 
getting updated and viewing events from close quarters. The primary 
purpose was to participate in the NGO seminar held at Goa (January 15-
18), the "Neemrana" meeting at New Delhi (March 13-15), and-the 
travelling seminars held at Jaipur and Udaipur (March 20-21). This piece 
essentially covers the secondary gain, learning about a neighbour. Some 
impressions.

The Shanghai Initiative Round Two on "Global and Regional Linkages of 
Arms Control" held at Goa generated interest and speculation in the 
print media mainly because, for inexplicable reasons, a New Delhi 
datelined report appearing in a German paper sensationalised the seminar 
as "secret negotiations" on the nuclear issue between India, Pakistan, 
the US and China. This media created sensation rapidly disappeared once 
the facts became known that the talks were neither secret nor an 
abnormal phenomenon.

The India-Pakistan Neemrana Initiative, like all Track Two diplomacy 
initiatives, is neither a substitute for the government-to-government 
negotiations on the bilateral contentious issues nor does it arrogate to 
itself the task of providing quick fixes for the complex and age-old 
inter-state disputes. It is a rebuke to the political will and the 
diplomatic skill of India and Pakistan, that in their post-independence 
era, instead of living as friendly neighbours they have become 
proverbial adversaries. South Asia faces turmoil because the Kashmir 
dispute remains unsettled and the political leadership in the two 
countries lacks courage to follow the path of peace which involves 
taking hard decisions. Resultantly, the Indo-Pakistan relations have 
nose-dived, the Ministerial Commission has not met for years, the 
Kashmir talks are deadlocked and the region simmers in a state of no 
peace no war.

That the Neemrana Initiative held its ninth meeting in New Delhi despite 
such adverse conditions is by itself an achievement. The greater the 
difficulties, the dire is the need to keep the negotiating shutters 
open, at official and unofficial levels. The Neemrana-like track two 
diplomacy can generate fresh ideas that can be picked up by the 
governments when reason and sanity motivate them to resume negotiations 
at the official level.

Elections in some crucial states dominated India's internal political 
scene. The Narasimha Rao-led political era is on the way out. A 
prominent Indian lamented that ethics had escaped India's public life 
and politics was riddled with corruption and crime. This may provide us 
no comfort because our own house stinks no less on these counts. The 
ultra-rightist Bharatiya Janata Party and the fire-breathing Shiv Sena 
have captured the vital states of Maharashtra and Gujerat, wherein lie 
the bulk of the Indian industry and also the Indian national wealth. The 
formidable trio power, money and Hindu fundamentalism does not augur 
well for India's already bruised secularism.

The du jure Chief  Minister of Maharashtra may be Manohar Joshi but the 
de facto ruler of  the state is none other than Bal Thackeray whose 
political philosophy and anti-minority tirades have already started 
ringing alarm bells in India. The trend is visible by the decisions 
taken so far. Aurangabad will soon be renamed Sambhaijinagar. Muslims 
will not be allowed to pray on the roads even when the devotees spill 
over the mosques. And, Shiv Sainiks have been ordered to get ready to 
perform their "national duty" of flushing out the Muslims from the 
state. Is the world on the verge of witnessing another ethnic cleansing 
Indian style?

Narasimha Rao is now a shaken prime minister incapable of peacefully 
settling disputes with India's neighbours, particularly Pakistan. This 
may alert the policy planners here. The Janata Dal-cum-communists 
victory in the state of Bihar has eroded support for the Indian Prime 
Minister. Once a mighty party, Congress has been discarded by the voters 
in many states on the charges of rampant corruption, political 
infighting, weak leadership and the dubious and devious role played by 
the Centre on the Realism demands that India and Pakistan should look to 
the future and unshackle themselves from the mistrust of the past to 
usher in an era of peace with honour. Many Muslims voted against the 
Congress candidates because they held the Prime Minister responsible for 
the destruction of the Babri Mosque. Even an upsurge in the Indian 
economy and the development of close ties with the US, did not help 
Congress. If Prime Minister Narasimha Rao holds on to power at the 
Centre for as long as he can manage, he will only weaken his party 
further. A significant feature of the elections is the emergence of the 
BJP as a mainstream party. A person having links with the establishment 
conceded that the Hindu revivalism was on the rise but argued that this 
trend may not necessarily be viewed as anti-Pakistan.

The Indian electronic and print media is jubilant over disturbances in 
Karachi and the prevailing political polarisation in Pakistan. They seem 
to believe that India's plan of manoeuvre is yielding results. So 
sustained is the anti-Pakistan venom spread by the media that anything 
good happening in Pakistan, though a rare development these days, seldom 
appears in the Indian Press. The Indian media is free, totally free, to 
paint Pakistan in any murky colours of its own choice. By so doing it 
misinforms and disinforms its readers in a subtle manner and poisons 
their minds. A political science student attending a seminar admitted 
that "My-impartiality vanishes when it comes to Pakistan". Some Indian 
academics at the same gathering expressed the view that the "Media and 
the politicians were mostly responsible for creating difficulties 
between India and Pakistan. The governments create tensions to stay in 
power".

The print media's "independence" is illustrated by an example. On 
Pakistan's Independence Day 1995 the Pakistan High Commission organised 
a cultural show in which Abida Parveen was to perform. The High 
Commissioner was promised a visa for the artist at a high level and 1200 
invitation cards were issued. The visa was delayed on vague pretexts and 
was belatedly issued after the last flight to New Delhi had already 
departed Pakistan. Left with no choice the cultural show was cancelled 
and the Pakistan High Commission sent paid advertisement to four 
prominent New Delhi newspapers. The Times of India, Hindustan Times, 
Pioneer and The Indian Express announcing the cancellation of the 
cultural show because of the visa hurdle and expressing regrets over the 
inconvenience caused to the invitees. All the four newspapers rang back 
the Pakistan High Commission within minutes after receiving the 
advertisement expressing their inability to publish it. The rabbit was 
out of the hat. The hidden hand at work had exposed their 
"independence".

Kashmir, one of the oldest items on the UN agenda, arouses mixed 
feelings in India. The Indian establishment and those linked with it 
maintain the well known official hard line to retain the state by all 
means. They advocate a moratorium on it, obviously to gain time to crush 
the freedom movement by force. Some others concede that while Kashmir 
"legally" belongs to them the Indian claim on the accession issue is not 
easy to defend on the moral plane. For yet others, Kashmir is 
essentially a problem of northern India and it arouses much less 
interest in the eastern or southern parts of the country. An Indian 
journalist pointed out that his country's stand on the disputed state 
might have been entirely different if New Delhi was located in the 
peninsular India. Yet another prominent Indian journalist said half 
jokingly, "Pakistan may take Kashmir provided she also accepts Bihar and 
Haryana with it". That remark explained the gravity of India's internal 
difficulties. A prominent Kashmiri leader said that the people of 
Kashmir were anti-India, the right of self determination cannot be 
denied to them and India had no option but to finally quit the state.

Idealism of today is the realism of tomorrow. Realism demands that India 
and Pakistan should look to the future and unshackle themselves from the 
mistrust of the past to usher in an era of peace with honour and 
sovereign equality of states for both as enshrined in the UN Charter.

Travelling in India has strengthened the conviction that a peaceful 
settlement of the Kashmir dispute will create a climate in South Asia 
highly conducive to promoting amity in achieving progress and prosperity 
in this region.

<hr><a name="wase">A case for deweaponisation
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Dr Mohammad Waseem

TOO many people are too heavily armed in today's Pakistan for its people 
to feel secure and for the state to be able to protect the life and 
property of its citizens.

An average citizen of Pakistan is almost twice as insecure as an average 
citizen of India. Similarly, an average citizen of Karachi, the most 
violent city of the country, is almost twice as insecure as an average 
citizen of Bombay, the Indian counterpart of Karachi. On the other hand, 
Pakistan is about half as capable of controlling social violence of all 
kinds - political, sectarian and criminal u as neighbouring India. 
Islamabad's capacity to control violence in Karachi is similarly half as 
much as New Delhi's potential to control violence in Bombay.

In the absence of reliable data relating to population, acts of violence 
and crime rate in general, these observations are at best approximations 
based on demographic estimates, reported incidents and informed opinion. 
A crucial input is in the form of public perception. A terrorised 
public, for example in Karachi, is likely to contribute to the loss of 
direction in terms of social insecurity and political instability even 
further. As opposed to this, a vigilant public plays the role of a 
bulwark against further atomisation of society and provides a direction 
to collective opinion in one way or the other.

At the heart of the problem lies weaponisation of society. The most 
important source of arms in Pakistan is the tribal area along the border 
with Afghanistan. The state tolerated the crude and relatively 
unsophisticated weapons manufacturing units in tribal agencies as a way 
of keeping the local population in good humour and not disturbing the 
status quo. In addition, it sought to buy the local cooperation by 
allowing it a flourishing trade in smuggled goods which has now assumed 
horrendous proportions. In time, the arms flow contributed to militancy 
of various professional and political groups. Instead of committing 
itself to a policy of gradual but firm elimination of arms manufacturing 
outside official control back in the 1960s or 1970s, the state actually 
looked the other way as this industry enlarged its clientele to 
incorporate major sectarian and ethnic groups in the 1980s.

As is widely known, Zia's martial law government presided over the flow 
of a large number of weapons from the Western countries to the Afghan 
resistance movement. It committed criminal negligence in keeping arms in 
the right hands, thus allowing ethnic, sectarian and criminal activists 
within Pakistan to gain access to these arms. In that crucial stage of 
Pakistan's history, the state committed the cardinal sin of not only 
being lax on the issue of internal security but also, even more 
significantly, losing its control over arms. The country is paying a 
heavy price for this in the 1990s.

Fictional, tribal, sectarian and ethnic conflicts are not new for our 
society. What is new is the use of lethal arms for conflict resolution. 
Previously, conflicts were essentially social and cultural in origin; 
now they are political immature. Before, conflict was geographically 
limited to the locality. Now, it extends over to large urban and rural 
areas. Before, it was controlled essentially by the police operating 
under the district administration. Now, Rangers and army units are 
frequently called in aid of civil authority for performing this function 
while operating under the command of central and provincial governments.

Weaponisation of Pakistan society took place not only by default but 
also by design. The insecure, narrow-minded and bigoted persons in the 
chain of authority at various levels of the government provided weapons 
to their henchmen under valid or, what was frequently the case, fake 
licences. The arming of the MQM cadres under Jam Sadiq Ali was indeed an 
extreme example of blind militarisation of one section of society. Prior 
to that, the reliance of the martial law government on

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Human civilisation has progressed from considerations
of, and preparations for, collective security based on
families, factions, tribes, groups and subgroups to finally
large-scale national societies. Weaponisation of such
sub-national groups as sectarian and ethnic groups is indeed
a retrogressive step in the march of history.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

several religious groups and parties led to a dangerously liberal policy 
of arming them. In the process, the state of Pakistan ended up helping 
rather than controlling the weaponisation of the society.

From the perspective of sectarian groups, arms provide the means to 
project their respective narrow ideological goals and halt the advances 
of the rival groups. Sunnis need them because Shias are perceived as 
seeking to spread their version of Islam in the country. The Shia 
minority feels acutely insecure in the face of perceived bigotry of the 
majority sect. In the view of all minority groups. various Islamisation 
programmes are simply meant to spread the Sunni domination over non-
Sunnis in economic, social, political and cultural matters.

Sectarian groups have increasingly sought to arm themselves in search of 
security for their workers and followers. A certain maximalist strategy 
has been followed by them to protect their interests and also secure 
their gains. Previously, sectarian conflicts were generally handled by 
the local administrative machinery of the state, essentially in the 
context of law and order. Certain rules of game had to be preserved even 
while maintaining and projecting the conflicting religious belief 
systems. Unfortunately, the state has withdrawn itself from an active 
policy of depoliticising religion, delinking its law and order policy 
from  ideological considerations and debarring militant groups from 
entering politics.

The weakness of the state in terms of both capacity and will to 
establish law and order at all costs has been exposed in the context of 
ethnic violence even more than in the realm of sectarian violence. The 
recent wave of sectarian and factional violence in Karachi bears 
evidence to that fact. The state's civil institutional resources have 
been stretched to their limit but there is still no end to violence in 
sight. The state's legitimacy is at stake, especially as a symbol of 
supreme power within the country. It is the reliance on the 
institutionalised and legitimate civil authority of the state rather 
than recourse to naked power of the army or para-military groups which 
can deliver the goods in the long run.

As far as institutional performance is concerned, the administration has 
miserably failed. Police efficiency in Karachi and the rest of the 
country is abysmally low. Moreover brutality of the police in Pakistan 
is legendary From 1985 onwards, no civilian government has undertaken a 
comprehensive project of police reform for training police, 
deethnicising its outlook and subordinating its role to the magistracy 
in both letter and spirit. Police should be entrusted with the job of 
deweaponising the society while at the same time respecting human rights 
to the maximum. Just as arms in the hands of citizens make a mockery of 
the state in the modern world, arms in the hands of police can destroy 
the foundations of organised society if their use is not properly 
regulated.

As far as legitimacy of the state is concerned, it is directly related 
to its potential to rule efficiently and effectively. The state needs to 
keep the nation's faith in it for upholding justice and avoiding 
discrimination on the basis of ethnic origins, denominational identities 
and class background. Human civilisation has progressed from 
considerations of, and preparations for, collective security based on 
families, factions, tribes, groups and sub-groups to finally large-scale 
national societies. Weaponisation of such sub-national groups as 
sectarian and ethnic groups is indeed a retrogressive step in the march 
of history. It is an affront to the modern nation-state seeking to 
primitives it. It must establish and consolidate its legitimacy among 
all sections of the population.

De-weaponisation is the first step towards establishment of a democratic 
order in the country. Democracy is the principle of sharing 'legitimate 
authority' of the state not sharing the armed might of the state.

<hr><a name="desa">Morarji Desai
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

WITH the passing away of the 99-year-old Mr Morarji Desai, India has 
lost one of the last surviving ardent disciples of Mahatma Gandhi and an 
illustrious freedom fighter. A staunch Congressite all his life, Mr 
Desai parted company with the party in 1969 for differences over the 
question of reorganisation of the Congress high command. In 1975, at the 
age of 79, he decided to join hands with some other veteran Congressites 
to form the Janata Party, a hastily cobbled together coalition of four 
small parties. Together they launched a vigorous campaign against the 
late Mrs Indira Gandhi's autocratic style of government and the 
repressive measures adopted by her to keep herself in power, after her 
election to the parliament had been held void by the Allahabad High 
Court on grounds of electoral malpractices. The general elections in 
February 1977 resulted in a humiliating defeat for the Congress, and 
found Mr Morarji Desai, then 81, installed as Prime Minister at the head 
of the Janata Party government.

Although Janata had several staunch Hindu revivalists among its top 
leadership Mr Desai's tenure as Prime Minister (1977-1979) marked one of 
the calmest spells in India-Pakistan relations. Unlike his predecessor, 
he had no inclination to adopt an arrogant posture towards Pakistan and 
he repeatedly said that all neighbouring countries had a right to pursue 
their defence policies in accordance with what they regarded to be their 
genuine security needs. At the same time, his foreign minister, Mr Atal 
Bihari Vajpayee, who belonged to the Hindu revivalist Bharatiya Janata 
Party (BJP), also made it known that the Janata government had no 
intention unlike Mrs Gandhi's to invoke the perception of a non-existent 
'threat' from Pakistan to muster support for its policies.

Pakistan awarded its highest civil award, Nishan-e-Pakistan, to Mr 
Morarji Desai, who was already a recipient of his country's highest 
civil award. He was thus the only Indian leader to have been thus 
honoured by both countries. Mr Desai was also widely known for his 
courageous stand in providing protection to the Muslims of Bombay state 
during the communal holocaust in the aftermath of the partition of the 
subcontinent. Unfortunately, Mr Desai's tenure as Prime Minister was 
unexpectedly cut short when the Janata Party went out of office within 
27 months as a result of mid-term general elections prompted by 
dissensions in the top rung of the party leadership. Otherwise, he might 
well have made a lasting contribution to the state of India-Pakistan 
relations.

After he lost power, Mr Desai retired to his modest home in Bombay and 
disengaged himself almost totally from politics. Till death he led a 
reclusive life, marked by simplicity and severe- self-discipline. A 
colleague was once asked to describe what Mr Morarji Desai was like. He 
pointed to an ancient iron pillar, believed to have been installed in 
the days of Asoka, close to the Qutub Minar, and said: "You put a Gandhi 
cap on top of that pillar and you have Morarji Desai. " In his 
principles, Mr Morarji Desai was as upright and unbending as the iron 
pillar. Now, that iron pillar is no more.

<hr><a name="sriu">Sri Lanka upset Pakistan
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ayaz Memon

SHARJAH, April 11: In Sri Lanka's do-or-die battle Pakistan became a 
surprising and dramatic casualty. But while the result was astonishing, 
there is no deep analysis needed to reach its core: Pakistan simply 
played appalling cricket.

From the first over of the day, in which Aamir Sohail was dismissed, to 
the last when Hashan Tillekratne hoisted Arshad Khan for a six over mid-
wicket, Pakistan stuttered and spluttered, then finally succumbed. Once 
they had failed to score the 214 run needed to ensure a place in the 
final, Sri Lanka sensed the opportunity. What followed was an assault 
that left Pakistan's bowling image as badly battered as the batting had 
been bruised in the first.

There was always something precarious about this Pakistan side, the 
victory over India notwithstanding. Not every match can be won on 
adrenalin, and at some stage, the inexperience and lack of depth in both 
the batting and bowling had to show up. For Pakistan, this could not 
have come at a worse time.

The inherent weaknesses had made it imperative that all the five 
experienced players fulfil the expectations vested in them completely. 
In the event, only Inzamam, who made a brilliant 73, and Wasim Akram to 
a certain extent, came good. The two openers, Aamir Sohail and Saeed 
Anwar flopped, and Aaqib Javed did not play at all.

If the sudden injury to Aaqib was an avoidable tragedy, what transpired 
after Ranatunga had won the toss, was nothing short of a farce. Sohail 
fell second ball to a splendid late outswinger from Chaminda Vaas that 
nicked the edge of his tentative bat, but that was about the only true 
wicket-deserving delivery bowled in the innings. The remaining fell, 
inexplicably and abjectly.

It was an exhibition of grotesque batsmanship, with little evidence of 
class, character or even common sense, save from the composed Inzamam. 
Mujtaba and Anwar fell to shots unbecoming of their stature. Akram, 
frustrated by the restrictive leg stump line of Jayasuriya, went for a 
mighty heave-ho with head in air and was stumped. There were also two 
runouts to accentuate the overall foolhardiness.

Strangely, every setback seemed to provoke the next batsman into further 
indiscretion instead of caution, suggesting a certain casualness, even 
callousness in the team. By the time the ramifications of such an 
approach had been understood, it was just too late.

If Pakistan would still reach 178, after losing Akram to become 38 for 5 
in the l9th over, it was entirely due to the phlegmatic Inzamam who 
gallantly attempted a resurrection of the innings even as every 
colleague of his seemed intent on causing further ruination.

Baby-faced and inscrutable, Inzamam bats with admirable maturity, 
expressing his expertise unusually and powerfully. He has an ox-like, 
well-filled out frame with powerful shoulders and forearms.

The backlift is modest, but when he times the ball well it acquires a 
velocity that would do a Richards or Greenidge proud.

Inzamam again excelled driving in front of the wicket. Two of his three 
sixes were still gathering height when they crossed the playing 
periphery, and one in fact was so powerfully struck that Roshan Mahanama 
was felled by the sheer impact while trying to take the catch at long 
off.

The value of his knock, however, was greater f or its tenacity. He held 
the innings together through its most turbulent phase, and farmed the 
bowling deftly to expose the tail enders as little as possible. If his 
batting still fell short of the truly heroic, it is because he too fell 
to a rash shot in the 46th over, when his presence right till the end 
was vital.

Consequently, Pakistan's last four overs yielded less than 20 runs. 
Whether 20 more would have made a difference was the lunch time debate 
which became purely academic after Sanath Jayasuriya came out to bat 
with a vigour and bravado that stunned the Pakistanis.

He made 30 from 15 deliveries, nullifying the threat of Akram with the 
new ball and decimating Aamir Nazir with scintillating cuts and short 
arm pulls, giving the innings a momentum that made the task of scoring 
at 5.4 runs an over look ridiculously simple.

Barring Akram, the inexperienced attack capitulated in the face of 
sustained aggression from the batsmen who followed, and when, after a 
few tense moments, Tillekaratne was bold enough to step out and hit 
Arshad Khan over mid wicket for six, the improbable had been witnessed. 
The underdog had won the day.
