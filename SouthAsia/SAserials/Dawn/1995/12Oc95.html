Staff Report
KARACHI, Oct. 8: Four people were shot dead and four others wounded in 
the city on Sunday.
The CIA Garden seized eight rockets and four shells in raids conducted 
in Sharifabad and Orangi Town on Saturday night. It also arrested 11 
people involved in the heinous crime, but did not disclose their 
names.
Moreover, the law enforcement agencies had laid a siege to the Lines 
Area, made house-to-house search and rounded up hundreds of suspects 
for interrogation, witnesses said.  Syed Mohammad Tahir was found dead 
with his hands tied and bullet holes in his ear under a bridge. He was 
a former policeman, but the area police did not confirm.
Zakir Shah, 32, was gunned down in an encounter with police in Baldia 
Town, police said. The Baldia Town police said they were informed by 
the 134, an emergency cell located in the chief ministers house, that 
an outlaw was hiding in Kohati Mohallah. A shoot-out followed when 
Zakir Shah fired upon the police. He was killed after being hit by a 
bullet, police said.
The MQM and the Haqiqi in separate statements blamed each other for 
paving way for the siege-and-search operation in the Lines Area.
The MQM alleged intra-factional fighting within the Haqiqi had led the 
law enforcers to humiliate Mohajirs in the name of operation in the 
area.  The MQM claimed the law enforcers had arrested more than 1,000 
people in the shanty settlements of Lines Area. While the Haqiqi 
alleged the law enforcers had arrested more than 2,000 people in the 
area.
The Haqiqi alleged the operation was aimed at crushing the party, 
which is struggling for the rights of Mohajirs through peaceful 
means. It held extortionists, minions of security agencies and the 
narcotic peddlers responsible for the siege.
The police denied the arrest of a single person during the siege.

<a name="dehl">Dehlavi gets govts reply; decision on talks today</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 5: The governments reply to the letter of chief MQM 
negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi was delivered to him on Thursday evening but 
Mr Dehlavi said not all the irritants had been removed.
Mr Dehlavi said his committee would, however, discuss the contents of 
the letter on Friday and a decision on whether to resume the talks 
would be taken after that. If the governments reply is positive, we 
will resume negotiations, said Mr Dehlavi.
Meanwhile, chief government negotiator N.D. Khan told Dawn the reply 
has been sent with all sincerity because we are trying to seek a 
political settlement to the Karachi problem.
But the issue of the release of Shazia Farooq has created confusion as 
Mr Dehlavi said she had not yet been released as promised by a member 
of the government negotiating team, whereas the chief government 
negotiator said the lady in question was Shania, wife of Fahim 
Commando.
Mr Dehlavi, when contacted, said his side had never asked for the 
release of anyone named Shania. This is a new development and we will 
take it into consideration at our meeting, he emphasised.
Mr Dehlavi said there were no indications about the restoration of 
police guards for the security of the negotiating team members.
Shaikh Liaquat Hussain confirmed that his passport was personally 
delivered to him by Mr Zuhair Akram Nadeem.
Mr Hussain during a meeting with Mr Nadeem emphasised the need to find 
out why Shazia Farooq was not yet released.

<a name="mqms">MQM says govt reply disappointing</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 6: Hopes for an early resumption of the stalled talks 
between MQM and the government were dashed on Friday after the MQM 
negotiating team termed the government reply as disappointing.
The MQM had linked resumption of talks with a positive reply to its 
letter. As a consequence to the decision the MQM team has decided not 
to resume talks for the time being, said the chief MQM negotiator, 
Ajmal Dehlavi.
In a brief statement issued after the meeting it said that a written 
response to Mr Khans reply would be sent to him in a couple of days.
Since the MQM would itself take a couple of days to send a written 
formulation after which the government side would also require a few 
more days to spell out its position, the talks are not expected to be 
resumed before next week, sources close to the MQM negotiating said.
Mr Dehlavi was cautious in replying to questions about the details of 
the meeting and said we have deliberately kept the statement brief 
because we dont want to further escalate the controversy.

<a name="alta">Altaf sends documents to ICJ</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Oct 6: In a letter addressed to the President of the 
International Court of Justice at The Hague, the MQM has forwarded to 
him legal documents about the arrest and the subsequent death of an 
MQM worker Ferozeuddin with two other party workers, Pervaiz Akhtar 
and Mohammed Ali, who, it is alleged, were killed by the rangers and 
the police, while the killings were described officially to have 
occurred in encounters with the police.
The letter from the MQM leader, Mr Altaf Hussain, says that the 
purpose of sending you the present set of documents is to reveal the 
starting sequence of events which establish the determined policy of 
the Bhutto government to simply physically eliminate the MQM workers 
in the custody of the paramilitary rangers or the police through cold 
blooded murders.
The documents attached with the letter show that Ferozeuddin was 
arrested on Sept 20, according to the police, after an exchange of 
gunfire with some weapons and wireless sets. On the next day, he was 
produced before a magistrate who, despite a request for two weeks 
remand, only allowed the police one week remand of the detainee. 
Later, he was produced before the Special Terrorist Judge by the 
police which sought a weeks further remand. But the judge having seen 
marks of violence on his body ordered his transfer to judicial 
custody. But this order was ignored and the rangers took him to an 
unknown place where he was done to death along with two other detained 
MQM workers, the letter alleges.
The MQM leader has said that criminal cases should be registered, 
after investigation, against those who are responsible for the alleged 
killings. He has also accused the minister of interior, Naseerullah 
Babar, under whose instructions the rangers and the police are 
carrying out relentless killings of Mohajirs. They do not have the 
slightest regard for law or legality, he writes.
He has invoked the additional protocol of the Geneva Convention, which 
applies to persons captured in internal conflict, and has accused the 
interior minister, the Sindh chief minister and others of violating 
the international law.
Copies of the letter have also been sent to the President and the army 
chief of Pakistan, to the British prime minister and the Us president, 
the International Red Cross, the Secretary-General of the United 
Nations, the president of the European Parliament, officials of the US 
State Department and the chief justices of the Supreme Court and Sindh 
high court in Pakistan.

Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Oct 7: The political leadership in Pakistan and the people of 
the country have been asked by the MQM leader, Mr Altaf Hussain, to 
counter the nefarious intentions and actions of the Bhutto 
government which, he alleged, was trying to create a catastrophic 
civil war in the country.
Mr Hussain claimed that arms were being brought for distribution among 
criminal elements and the Haqiqi group under the patronage of the 
minister of interior and with the collusion of the chief minister 
Sherpao of NWFP.
Mr Hussain said this was being done to destroy the MQM which has 
demolished the political credentials of the Pakistan Peoples Party in 
Sindh. He said the former chief minister of NWFP, Mr Sabir Shah, has 
also accused the government of planning to weaken and destroy the 
political opposition by supply arms to certain elements in Karachi and 
the rest of Sindh.
In another statement, the MQM leader has expressed his concern over 
the use of Frontier Constabulary and the Federal militia in and around 
the Sui area to expel Baloch followers of opposition leader, Sardar 
Akbar Bugti. He said this action would create another class of 
Mohajirs in Balochistan. He talked to Sardar Bugti over the telephone 
and backed his call for international assistance. Mr Hussain 
criticised the President for his apathy in not stopping the 
government from its unlawful actions.

<a name="crit">Dehlavi criticises attack on Secretariat</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 9: Chief MQM negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi on Monday condemned 
the targeted rocket attack on the New Sindh Secretariat. It seems to 
be the job of expert marksmen who hit the predetermined targets and as 
far as the MQM is concerned, we condemn such acts he said.
He said if it would have been the job of amateurs, the surrounding 
dwellings of Mohajirs would have been badly damaged.
So far, he said, contrary to previous occasions Sindh Chief Minister 
Abdullah Shah and interior Minister Naseerullah Babar had not 
implicated the MQM.
Mr Dehlavi said the incident was a targeted exercise as the rockets 
dropped on target. In the context of MQM-government talks, Mr Dehlavi 
said he had faxed the written reply to ND Khan to his Islamabad 
office. However, since the law minister had arrived in the city 
another copy was faxed to Zuhair Akram Nadeem for passing it on to 
him, said Mr Dehlavi.
He declined to divulge contents of his letter, saying although the 
government side had breached the understanding by releasing part of 
its communication to the Press.

<a name="accu">Altaf accuses police of murder in custody</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Correspondent Report
LONDON, Oct. 10: The MQM leadership has endorsed the call given by the 
partys co-ordination committee for a strike on Thursday as a protest 
against the killing on Tuesday of seven MQM workers, four of whom are 
alleged to have been killed while still in police custody.
The MQM leader has said he has been outraged at the direct 
executions by the police of four of his party workers while in 
judicial custody. He said seven MQM workers were gunned down by the 
police and rangers in two different alleged encounters. Four of them 
 Faheem Farooqi, Zeeshan Haider Abidi, Yousuf Rizwan and Altaf 
Qureshi  had been under arrest since Aug. 6. Until yesterday they 
were held in judicial custody in Karachi Central Jail.
On Tuesday morning, he alleged, they were taken under police 
supervision to Nazimabad police station where they were killed. 
Hussain claimed that medical reports showed they were shot at point 
blank range. But officials say that when they were escorted to the 
police station for identification, they came under sniper fire from 
unknown sources.
The MQM leader has emphasised that according to the official version 
the four persons were handcuffed and were under heavy police escorts. 
It was surprising that not one person from the police escort was 
injured by shots from the unknown gunmen. He described the police 
version as a sheer concoction of lies and said: Such inhuman and 
medieval actions of state terrorism were unmatched in the history of 
Pakistan and depicted the worst tyranny of the Government. At least 
10 MQM workers in judicial custody have been eliminated within the 
last few weeks, he added.
Hussain called upon the president and the army chief to use their 
influence and legal and moral authority so that legal proceedings 
could be initiated against those responsible for the latest tragedy. 
He also held the minister of interior, who is conducting the operation 
in Karachi, responsible for the killings.
He claimed that the same police officer was in charge of escorting the 
four MQM workers killed on Tuesday who led another escort on Aug. 2 
when four other party workers were killed, near the airport, allegedly 
by snipers fired. He said no legal system that allowed such barbarity 
could be respected. He warned that the circumstances were now beyond 
the stage where such acts of state terrorism could be tolerated by the 
people any longer.

<a name="baba">Babar blames MQM for rocket attack</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Report
KARACHI, Oct. 10: Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar has blamed the 
Mohajir Qaumi Movement for the rocket-propelled grenade attack on the 
new Sindh secretariat building on Monday, but could not explain the 
killing of under-custody alleged terrorists on Tuesday.
Speaking at a news conference, he did not oppose a judicial inquiry 
into the killings of under-custody terrorists who belonged to the 
MQM.
With regard to the attack on the secretariat, the minister conceded 
that it was not unexpected, and said: I was told by the IG police on 
Sunday that the MQM will change its tactics. But the minister had no 
convincing reply when questioned about the laxity of security measures 
around the secretariat when stepped-up attacks were feared.
The authorities, he said, had the reports that the  Altaf Group 
might resort to blasts or some other similar acts. Gen Babar said the 
terrorists looked  quite trained and it was believed they had 
fired from three different directions from an under-construction house 
just behind the secretariat building. He asserted that no rocket had 
been fired from the car in which the terrorists had come. However, 
one rocket might have been fired from a corner of the street at the 
back of the secretariat, he added.
Ballistic experts of the army were also examining the points from 
where the rockets might have been fired, he said. He noted that the 
penetration of rockets was not that much as was expected from a PRG-7 
rocket and that was why the damage was not so serious.
The interior minister said he could not say whether the chief 
ministers secretariat or the office of Health Minister Shamim Ahmed 
were the targets. But one thing was clear that their intentions were 
not good because they also hit the record room where files concerning 
the Karachi development package were kept and which were destroyed.
To a question, he said he was not aware of the presence of any 
American FBI people at the secretariat. He said he had come to know 
about their presence there only through newspapers on Tuesday.
The minister did not rule out the possibility of some other 
professionally trained groups being involved in the attack. He 
nevertheless tended to put the blame on the Naim Sheri group of the 
MQM because, according to him, this group had been involved in such 
acts in the past as well.
When informed that Altaf Hussain had condemned the rocket attack, the 
minister asked  with what kind of words for condemnation he has come 
out.

<a name="asks">Altaf asks supporters to remain united</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Oct 11: The MQM leader Altaf Hussain has said that no 
government has a right to kill people wanted by it without proper 
trial.
Commenting on the death of Fahim Commando and others he said the 
killing of MQM workers by the government in fake police encounters 
was not only a blatant violation of the Constitution and the law but 
was an insult to democracy and human values. The MQM chief said the 
way the Government was killing Mohajir youth in false encounters and 
if in response people in future take up arms in their defence they 
will be perfectly justified to do so, as to protect ones life and 
property is a fundamental, constitutional and Islamic right which no 
one can usurp.
Backing the call given by the MQM coordination committee to observe a 
day of protest on Thursday against the killings on Tuesday of several 
MQM workers, some of whom were under judicial custody and had been 
brought from prison to a police station, Mr Altaf Hussain reminded the 
President and the Prime Minister that those killed were not animals 
but human beings. He pledged to make the people responsible for these 
killings accountable and said they or their patrons will never be 
forgiven.
Mr Hussain asked his supporters to remain united and disciplined as 
victory will be of those who are oppressed. He appealed to the 
political leadership in the country and other right thinking people to 
come forward to end the present bloodshed. Indifference, he warned, 
may be costly and the Mohajirs may come to a conclusion which they 
could never have imagined.
He claimed that the fourth person to be killed in Nazimabad on 
Tuesday, with three others who were brought from jail, was Khurshid 
Anwar. Mr Hussain rejected the interior ministers statement of 
Tuesday in which he told pressmen that three MQM workers, Fahim 
Faruqi, Zeeshan Abidi, and Yousuf Rehman were killed by sniper fire 
when they were brought to Nazimabad from jail for identification of 
some other suspects. The minister had stated that another person was 
injured when police fired back at the snipers, one of whom died. The 
name of the injured was given as Khurshid Anwar and the Minister said 
he was now in custody and two of his sisters had also been arrested.
Mr Hussain said Khurshid Anwar, after being tortured, following his 
arrest at 3 am, was also killed with the three other MQM workers.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 11: The deputy commissioner, district central, has 
appointed SDM, Nazimabad, to conduct an inquiry into the gory incident 
in which the handcuffed and fettered MQM workers  Fahim Commando, 
Yousuf Rizwan, Zeeshan Haider and one unidentified man  were killed 
in Nazimabad in Tuesday while they were in police custody.
Meanwhile, an MQM spokesman on Wednesday identified the so called 
unidentified man as Khursheed Anwar killed in police custody. He also 
claimed that the police had arrested Khursheeds two sisters  Shaista 
and Shagufta  on Tuesday.
None of the policemen, who had escorted them to Nazimabad to identify 
some other suspects at a hideout there, was injured. Eyewitnesses said 
they were killed in front of a deserted house in a street through 
which a car can hardly pass. The assassins, after killing them, had 
managed to escape from the place.
The bodies of two of them were found in the courtyard of the house, an 
Edhi volunteer, who had gone their to transport bodies to hospital, 
said.
Hospital sources said autopsy performed on the victims showed that 
they were shot dead from behind at point-blank range.
The sources said that Fahim and two other accomplices were taken to 
Islamabad for further interrogation. They were brought back to Karachi 
and sent to jail. The airport police, after a court permission, had 
taken them into custody for interrogation on Tuesday morning to 
Nazimabad.
The police claimed they had come under fire by unidentified men when 
they arrived in front of the house where a raid was about to be 
conducted. Fahim and others died on the spot, and the policemen had to 
take refuge in the APC.
There was confusion about the death of Khursheed Anwar, who was 
reportedly arrested by the police at 3 am on Wednesday.
Federal Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar had himself at a Press 
conference on Tuesday confirmed the arrest of Khursheed Anwar and said 
he was in police custody.
Nusrat Nadim, the political secretary of MQM chief Altaf Hussain, 
claimed that the fourth unidentified person killed on Tuesday in 
Nazimabad was Khursheed Anwar.

<a name="pppv">PPP voters leaving party, claims PML leader</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
NAWABSHAH, Oct 6: The co-ordinating secretary of PML, Sindh, Mumtaz 
Ali Rind, claimed here on Friday that a large number of voters from 
the constituency of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had joined his 
party.
Talking to this correspondent, he said people now supported Mian 
Mohammad Nawaz Sharif and had also opened offices of the PML in the 
native town of Ms Bhutto which, he added, was an ample proof that they 
had rejected her.
Mr Rind said the struggle by the PML chief for the rights of poor 
people throughout the country had created pro-PML sentiments among 
them. The government had failed in solving the problems.
Mr Rid accused the PPP leadership of awarding all the jobs to 
jiyalas while the well-educated, talented and intelligent but poor 
youths were denied employment.
On the other hand, he alleged, the development funds were being 
misappropriated in the province by the PPPs favourite contractors in 
collusion with the concerned authorities.

<a name="govt">Govt to discuss issue of members production with opposition</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ISLAMABAD, Oct 6: Federal law minister Mr N. D. Khan said on Friday 
that the government has sought the help of the makers of the rule 90 
to know their point of views on it to make it applicable in the 
present circumstances.
The rule 90, in the National Assembly and rule 72, in the Senate has 
been the core issue resulting in many a heated debates between the 
government and the opposition in both the houses.
Talking at APP, Forum the minister said that it was decided to convene 
a meeting before the next session to thoroughly examine the issue so 
as to decide that how the objective laid down in the rule regarding 
the production of detained members in the Parliament could be 
achieved.
The minister was of the view that the only way out to solve the issue 
would be to review the rule 90 to ensure its implementation and to 
make it possible, the consensus among the government and opposition is 
a must.
As both the chair and the government have not been authorised by the 
rule to summon the detained members who are either in the custody of 
the judiciary or in the administrative control of the provincial 
governments.
He said MQM was a faction, and it could easily be merged by a like-
minded. He said the 1993 elections have given a clear messagea two-
party system.
He categorically said that no mid-term elections were possible and 
castigated the PML call for staging of demonstrations on Oct 19. It 
will muster no support as its past aimless drill which was in the 
name of tehreek-i-nijat. The one-point agenda with Mian Nawaz Sharif 
seems to be to seek mid-term elections, shorten the tenure of the 
government. Instead, its time for the PML to prepare a policy how to 
win the forthcoming general polls of 1988, rather than waste time in 
flimsy things.
He denied that any human rights violations were being committed in 
Karachi, as alleged by Mr Altaf Hussain, in his letter to the UN 
Secretary-General.
About Govt-Altaf group talks, he said, the same were being conducted 
on quid-pro-quo basis and the former believed that the latter had 
mandate from Karachi.
He told a questioner that he would soon furnish a reply to Dehlavis 
letter soon. He regretted that the MQM had unilaterally suspended 
dialogue for which it was itself responsible. He hoped wisdom would 
prevail and the talks would resume.

<a name="pmlu">PML unity talks today amid hopes & scepticism</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ashraf Mumtaz
LAHORE, Oct 7: The first meeting of the committees set up by the 
PML(N) and the PML(J) to explore possibility of reunification of the 
two factions is due to be held here on Sunday with conflicting 
assessments from the two sides about the outcome.
PML(J) sources are not very optimistic about a breakthrough. The two 
sides are poles apart and thus no high hopes should be pinned on the 
meeting, authoritative PML(J) sources said on Saturday.
The sources alleged that Mian Nawaz Sharif wanted to break the PDF and 
oust Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto which the PML(J) did not favour.
Mr Chattha had once proposed that the presidents of all factions 
should step down and let the party elect a new party chief. The 
formula was not acceptable to Mian Nawaz Sharif. Other party leaders 
have been saying that the chairmanship of Mr Sharif is not negotiable 
as the credit for making the PML a popular party went exclusively to 
him. The PML(J) could be offered other offices in the party if they 
were interested in the partys unity, provincial PML(N) president 
Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi had said a few days ago.
But just a day before the talks, PML(N) sources report that Mr Sharif 
could be ready to step down provided PML(J) ministers in the cabinet 
resigned.
The condition has created doubts in the minds of the PML(J) leaders 
who say that they would not trust Mr Sharif even if he expressed his 
willingness to step down as head of his faction.
Another consideration for the PML(J) would be whether the united party 
could work with leaders like Wali Khan, Altaf Hussain and Mahmud 
Achakzai. He implied that while these leaders were allies of Mr 
Sharif, the PML(J) would not like to join hands with them.
Another leader said the possibility of unity between the two factions 
was remote as Mr Sharif believed in the politics of confrontation 
which was not the case with the PML(J).
The chances of the two sides coming close were also dimmed by a sudden 
revolt in the PML(J) parliamentary party in the NWFP. Of the four 
PML(J) MPAs, three have opposed the unity efforts and declared that 
they would not be party to such moves. The fourth, Saleem Saifullah, 
is a member of the PML(J) committee for the talks.

<a name="mili">Military should not interfere in internal affairs, seminar told</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 7: Military should not intervene in the internal affairs 
on any pretext and it should be restructured through cost-effective 
measures to meet the future hi-tech threat.
Concern was also expressed over continuing violence in Karachi which 
was causing internal instability and thus affecting the overall 
defence capability.
Mr Shahi said India and Pakistan were believed to have reached a 
condition of non-weaponised deterrence in which either of them could 
move quickly to produce a nuclear weapon if wished. Hence, he said, 
South Asia would never again see a conventional war, since any such 
war could quickly turn nuclear.
Mr Shahi was of the view that while Pakistans nuclear programme 
remained frozen since January 1989, India continued to produce 
weapons-grade plutonium without interruption.
Mr Shahi also dealt with the Brown amendment and Pakistans relations 
with the US and the regional countries.
Dr.Shireen Mazari said that there is an urgent need for countries 
like Pakistan to frame their security policies after acknowledging the 
continuing legitimacy of the instrumentality of war and the resurgence 
of the rationality of military power as a viable policy option.
She questioned the wisdom of following the US blindly in the 
international peacekeeping role. She said there was no rationale in 
Pakistans peacekeeping role in Haiti and Somalia.
Former navy chief vice Admiral H.M.S. Choudri while speaking on the 
importance of sea power emphasised the need for cost- effective 
defence. His views were also shared by Air Marshal Ayaz Ahmed Khan.
Giving his views on threat perception, General K.M. Arif, spelt out 
his views in the global, regional and south Asian context. He, held 
the view that internal stability was a must to ensure effective 
defence of the country.
He was of the view that Pakistan did not have a viable Afghan policy 
while Iran was vital to Pakistans security.
In the context of the role of the armed forces, he said It gives no 
power to the military to intervene in the internal affairs on any 
pretext.
Altaf Gauhar was of the view that the greatest security problem of 
Pakistan was in Karachi.
Orders to shoot at sight, blindfolding the people, rounding womenfolk 
in the middle of the night and after some time accusing them of 
running a brothel  were detrimental to Pakistans interest.
I dont know whether Altaf Hussain is a traitor or not but we are 
certainly ashamed of the way we are treating our citizens in Karachi, 
said Mr Gauhar while commenting on the peace-keeping role of law 
enforcement agencies.
Gen. Kamal Mateenuddin was of the view that conventional deterrent 
must be geared up and all elements of national power must be utilised 
to ensure credible defence. He was against nuclear option.

Punjabis, Pakhtuns, Sindhis, Balochs and Urdu-speaking people would in 
future attempt to stop the MQM from paralysing the city through their 
strikes.
Addressing the alliance of seven political parties groups at a local 
hotel, Mr Awan announced that the alliance of like-minded persons 
would try to ensure that businesses stayed open and transporters plied 
their vehicles even during strike call days.
If they burn one vehicle of Punjabis and Pakhtuns, we will burn 100 
vehicles of MQM supporters, he told a cheering crowd, mostly 
comprising transporters.
The alliance, which includes PPI, National Democratic Front, Muslim 
Welfare Movement, Pakistan Mazloom Ittehad Party, Pakistan Transport 
Federation, Sindhi Action Committee and Pakistan Minority Ittehad, was 
also addressed by their representatives.
The PPI supreme council members took oath, supporting the peaceful 
goals outlined by the alliance.
Abdur Rauf Khan Sasoli of NDF invited MQM chief Altaf Hussein to join 
the alliance in struggling for the rights of the oppressed people, 
adding that the massacre of poor and unarmed civilians will not solve 
the problem.

LAHORE, Oct 7: Opposition leader Mian Nawaz Sharif alleged on Saturday 
that Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was mortgaging the sovereignty of 
the country so that she could become Secretary-General of the United 
Nations.
For this purpose, he claimed, she could extend clandestine support to 
India to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council for 
which it was aspiring for quite some time.
He said Ms Bhutto wanted to become head of the world body because she 
knew that this was the only way to save herself from public wrath and 
the billions and trillions, he alleged, she had amassed with the 
help of her husband.
He held the prime minister responsible for all problems facing the 
country and said a single solution of all problems lies in getting 
rid of the prime minister and her husband Asif Zardari.
Rejecting the allegation that he went to meet MQM chief Altaf Husain 
in London to urge him to give a strike call in Pakistan, Mr Sharif 
said he did not need anyones help for a shutdown of business. My 
personal appeal to the people is sufficient to ensure a strike in the 
country.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammed Riaz
KARACHI, Oct 9: In a 10-minute operation, beginning at 12:13 pm, on 
Monday, terrorists fired six Russian-made rockets at the New Sindh 
Secretariat building, which hit the New Secretariat block, the hub of 
the administration, and rocked the residential area and commercial 
centres.
Soon after the incident, the police cordoned off the area and rounded 
up many shopkeepers for interrogation.
The terrorists had fired the rockets from three different directions 
at the Secretariat building, causing extensive damage to the fifth, 
sixth and seventh floors.
The offices of two ministers, secretaries and section officers were 
completely damaged, but there were no casualties. Flying pieces of 
window-panes, however, wounded four people.
A fire broke out after an explosion in the office of a section officer 
on the fifth floor, destroying records piled up in the corridor. As 
the fire spread, records, stored on steel racks, were also burnt.
Offices of the Health Minister Shamim Ahmad, who defected from the 
MQM, also on the seventh floor, were the prime target as the blast 
ripped off the secretarial section, causing extensive damage.
Commenting on the attacks on selected offices, a high-ranking Sindh 
official said: It shows that the terrorists were well- informed about 
the location of offices they wanted to attack.
Sindh minister Haji Zafar Ahmad Leghari held the MQM and Indian agents 
responsible for the attack.
About the FBI agents, he said: They have come of their own accord. We 
didnt invite them. However, their help is sought in the course of 
this complicated situation.
When the FBI agents were asked who had asked them to visit the rocket-
hit offices, they remained silent.
A peon said policemen on pickets atop the boundary wall were the first 
to flee after the blast.

go scott free. We will fight terrorists till they are eliminated.
He appealed to people, particularly those who might have seen the 
terrorists to cooperate with the authorities in identifying them.
He said four out of 28 police personnel who were on duty at the

Provincial Health Minister Shamim Ahmed said, in fact, he was the 
target of rocket attack as two of the rockets landed at his office 
causing serious damage.
The health minister who escaped the attack as he was holding a meeting 
at his residence, said the situation was serious in view of the 
threats of civil war by Altaf Hussain. He said, it is Altaf Hussain 
who speaks about civil war but involves the government and holds it 
responsible for the war.
The health Minister said many-a-times in the past he asked the IGP and 
DIG for enhanced security. He said there were no security arrangements 
even at his house. If terrorists can target me at the Sindh 
Secretariat, they can repeat the same at my residence, as well, he 
said.
He said that the government, had mobilised all its resources for an 
early arrest of terrorists involved in rocket attack.
They were talking to people in the Secretariat building during their 
visit after the rocket attack. Murad Ali Shah said Secretariat 
building was a national property and anybody attacking such buildings

QUETTA, Oct 9: Mir Murtaza Bhutto chairman of the PPP (SB) has said 
that to avoid extra-constitutional steps, holding of mid-term 
elections was a desirable option to save democracy.
Although holding of elections since 1988 had no positive results yet 
the countrys situation demand early polls, said Mr Bhutto. We 
support the mid-term polls to block the way for army intervention 
which would pave the way for dictatorship as it is a better solution 
rather to push the country towards civil war, Murtaza observed.
PPP leader announced his party would participate in the mid-term polls 
if announced.
Referring to the Karachi problem, he claimed that terrorists 
activities were going on due to intra feud between two factions of 
MQM. However, other factors could not be ruled out, particularly the 
involvement of drug mafia, land mafia and other criminal groups 
besides the presence of three million illegal immigrants there.
PPP leader further said that local bodies elections should be held in 
Karachi and other parts of the country so that people should resolve 
their problems through their elected representatives.
He demanded that three million aliens should be expelled from Karachi 
to help normalise the situation.
Replying to a question, the leader of PPP (SB) announced that he was

ISLAMABAD, Oct. 10: The top leadership of Pakistan Muslim League has 
become sharply divided over the strategy of observing a Black Day on 
Oct. 19 without following it up with an organised public agitation 
against the government.
While party leaders are understandably refuting the presence of any 
such differences, there is a clear split between those in favour of 
any sort of political agitation and those opting for a delayed but 
seriously planned offensive against the government instead of 
whittling away of energies in such useless activities, as described 
by one PML critic of the call.
The situation has come to such a head that two of its top leaders, Gen 
Majid Malik and Chaudhry Nisar are no longer on talking terms with one 
another and Gen Malik has even refused to attend any party meeting in 
Chaudhry Nisars presence.
According to the supporters of the call, including Gohar Ayub Khan, 
Ahsan Iqbal, Chaudhry Nisar and Mushahid Hussain, the opposition must 
continue taking every possible pot-shot at the government instead of 
waiting for one big street movement to come about. These hawks within 
the party believe, as stated by Ahsan Iqbal, MNA: We must keep doing 
something to keep the public aware of the governments wrongdoings and 
also to boost the morale of our own party members.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz's bank accounts frozen</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Report
ISLAMABAD, Oct. 10: The bank account of Mian Nawaz Sharif and other 
directors of Ittefaq group had been frozen for their failure to pay Rs 
400 million outstanding against them as income and wealth tax. An 
official spokesman said in a statement that Nawaz Sharif had not 
discharged his national obligation of paying the income and wealth 
tax.
According to Press reports Nawaz Sharif on assuming the office of 
prime minister in 1990 had allegedly ordered authorities that the 
amount outstanding against him and other directors as income and 
various other taxes be written off. They, thereafter, submitted 
applications to the authorities for this purpose. Their outstanding 
amounts were written off the same day.
Later, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto directed the authorities to 
investigate the matter. The Income Tax Department also filed an appeal 
against writing off the outstanding amount. 
The appeal was accepted and the directors were ordered to pay Rs 400 
million. Nawaz Sharif and the other directors did not comply with the 
order. Therefore, their bank accounts have been frozen. The 
outstanding amount will be realised from these accounts and by 
auctioning their immovable property.
It is also of interest that one case of bad debt of Rs six billion is 
also pending against Nawaz Sharif.

<a name="perv">Pervaiz demands date for mid-term polls</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
LAHORE, Oct 11: Opposition leader in the Punjab Assembly Chaudhry 
Pervaiz Elahi demanded on Wednesday that the government should set a 
date for mid-term elections and hold talks with the opposition on a 
nine-point package offered by Mian Nawaz Sharif in October last year.
The nine-point package of Mr Sharif, it may be pointed out, requires 
the president and the prime minister to resign before the talks.
He said it was a great injustice to allege that the opposition was 
engaged in confrontation against the government. In fact, he alleged, 
the government did not want to do anything for the welfare of the 
people.
Mr Pervaiz Elahi, alleged that the government had stepped up 
victimisation of the opposition legislators. He alleged that the 
government was undermining the sovereignty of parliament and 
intelligence agencies were being given a free hand.
Replying to a question he said Mr Sharif would not resign as head of 
his faction for the sake of PML(N) and the PML(J) merger.

<a name="stat">State Bank wants tax exemptions withdrawn</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sabihuddin Ghausi
KARACHI, Oct. 8: Calling the rising level of prices in 1994-95 a 
disturbing aspect of economic developments, the State Bank of 
Pakistan, in its annual report released on Sunday, has suggested the 
introduction of structural reforms in the budget to generate more 
real resources through taxation of consumption and income.
The base of income tax needs to be expanded through inclusion of all 
incomes, including agricultural income, and elimination of concessions 
and exemptions that have become loopholes for tax evasion, is the key 
suggestion offered in the SBP Annual Report for 1994-95.
While proposing the broadening of the income tax base and introduction 
of a broad based, low rate consumption tax, the SBP report, at the 
same time, has urged the government to continue and intensify the 
expenditure restraint policy and has emphasised the need for an 
improvement in the efficiency of public sector corporations.
The target of reducing the rate of inflation to a single digit level 
is difficult but attainable, asserts the report while referring to 
the 1995-96 budget targets which envisages reduction of inflation rate 
to 9.5 % as against 12.9 % witnessed during 1994-95. 
However, the report maintains that containing inflation rate within a 
single digit level is possible provided higher economic growth is 
reinforced by a reduction in monetary expansion which, in turn, 
depends on the governments ability to contain budget deficit to 5 % 
of GDP and governments borrowing from the banking system within the 
Credit Plan target.
The SBP report calls for a well-planned programme for documentation of 
the economy which, it stresses, is critically needed to restructure 
the income and consumption taxes on modern lines. This, in 
combination with rationalisation of the tariff structure and reduction 
in statutory tax rates, would also help reduce the size of the 
underground economy.
It also suggests the provincial governments and local bodies also need 
to mount their own tax efforts to meet a part of their expenditures. 
The public sector corporations also need to improve their efficiency, 
and, in addition to servicing their debt, must give a reasonable rate 
of return on public sector investment. It stresses the improvement in 
tax administration and tax compliance.
Another major recommendation of the State Bank of Pakistan report is 
the speedy privatisation of nationalised commercial banks and the 
development financial institutions to effectively tackle the problems 
of mounting default of loans and rising financial intermediation. 
Terming the excessive loan defaults in NCBs a matter of great 
concern, the report says that it has contributed to the high lending 
rates and the lowering of rates of return on deposits.
The report attributes the high inflationary gap as measured by the 
difference between the rates of monetary expansion and GDP growth as 
the main cause of inflation in Pakistan which has extended over 
several years including 1994-95. 
In addition, a rise in world prices of Pakistans key imports, upward 
adjustment in administered prices and reliance on indirect taxes for 
the mobilisation of resources contributed to the increase in prices.
In 1994-95 the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price 
Index (CPI), increased to 12.9% from 11.2% in 1993-94.
Partly, the supply side shortfalls, mainly because of adverse weather 
conditions, heavy rains and floods affecting cotton production and 
damaging the minor crops contributed to the increases in prices. But 
the SBP report mainly blames the major slippages on the demand 
management side as reflected in monetary expansion of 16.6% in 1994-
95 compared with target of 11.8% as the main contributing factor to 
the inflation.
According to the report, all of the price indices in 1994-95 recorded 
higher rates of increase as compared to 1993-94. The CPI recorded an 
annual average increase of 12.9%, followed by GDP deflator, 14.8%, the 
Sensitive Price Indicator by 15.5%, and the wholesale Price Index by 
16.3%. A review of the indices showed that bulk of the increase in 
prices during 1994-95 reflected the sharp rise in prices of food items 
which, in fact, contributed 60% of the overall increase in WPI and 
about two-thirds of overall increase in CPI.
The report says that several factors contributed to the 
intensification of inflationary pressures in 1994-95. At the macro 
level, the gap between the rates of growth of money supply and of 
output (inflationary gap) was about 12 percentage points in 1994-95 
compared to the target of 5 percentage points. In 1994-95 the 
production growth was 4.7% as against the target of 6.9% while money 
supply soared by 16.6% as against the projected rise of 11.8% and in 
process expanded the inflationary gap by 12 percentage points.
The main cause of excessive money supply was public sector 
borrowings, with government borrowing for budgetary support exceeding 
the limits set in the Credit Plan in most of the year. In addition, 
use of a part of the privatisation proceeds and short term foreign 
borrowings towards the end of the year to finance budget deficit 
exerted expansionary impact on money supply. Moreover, increased 
borrowings by public sector corporations and enterprises, large 
disbursement of credit by the Agricultural Development Bank of 
Pakistan (ADBP) under its government sponsored credit schemes and 
debiting of accrued mark up to the borrowers accounts by banks at the 
end of the year was reflected in an increase in bank credit to the 
private sector, the SBP report blames.
Among other factors, reported to have led to increase in cost of 
living, was the scarcity of perishable food items. Similarly the 
recent budgetary measures to raise resources in the public sector were 
generally of high inflation intensity. Increase in prices of 
petroleum, gas and electricity had both a direct effect on consumer 
prices and indirect one. Indirect taxes were also immediately 
translated into higher output prices. On the government side, a part 
of even current expenditure was financed by borrowings. A sharp 
increase on world prices of several of the essential imported items 
also contributed in inflation. Additionally the depreciation of dollar 
value in respect of other currencies did lead to an increase in the 
rupee cost of imports. Hardening of the inflationary expectations and 
hoarding of goods to make windfall profits were also contributory to 
the inflation.
In the backdrop of the excess demand conditions that have prevailed 
for the last several years and the entrenched inflationary 
expectations, the SBP considers it imperative for the government to 
pursue a tight fiscal and monetary policy in the foreseeable future.
Monetary restraint, in combination with expected high output growth 
in 1995-96 and beyond, could begin to make a dent on inflationary 
expectations and on inflation is the prescription being offered by 
the SBP with a clear signal that micro level or sectoral measures to 
combat inflation will succeed only in the context of improved 
macroeconomic conditions.
For 1995-96 the SBP has proposed to contain the public sector 
corporations borrowings, particularly the ADBP lending operations 
within the Credit Plan limits. It has also suggested similar 
restrictions of complying with planned credit limits for the private 
sector.
Other area of major concern for the SBP is the substantial 
accumulation of domestic and foreign debts leading to a sharp increase 
in the debt servicing. Estimating the total national debt at the end 
of June 1995 at Rs 1,554.6 billion, constituting 83.3% of 1994-95 GDP, 
which includes Rs 796.8 billion domestic debt resulting in debt 
servicing of Rs 101.9 billion, the SBP advises that it is, therefore, 
vital that Pakistan determines the level of sustainable budget deficit 
consistent with its revenue generation potential so as to avoid 
getting into the vicious circle of rising debt services and higher 
budget deficit.
Notwithstanding internal financial imbalances, the balance of payment 
in 1994-95 showed improvement on several counts as exports grew by 
17.9% as against negative growth in 1993-94, and there was a sharp 
improvement of 20% in home remittances, and for the first time foreign 
exchange reserves were built up with only a nominal increase in the 
countrys short term liabilities.
Another redeeming feature has been more than 100% rise in foreign 
investment to 1.53 billion dollars in 1994-95 from 0.65 billion 
dollars in 1993-94. In 1994-95 the government successfully launched 
150 million dollars bond. 	
Imports also swelled up by 16.7% because of the greater inflow of 
capital goods mainly because of rise in the investment in the power, 
export-oriented and technology intensive sectors. While noting an 
appreciable rise in investment, the SBP report says that it can be 
sustained over the long run only by increase in the level of domestic 
savings. The national savings in 1994-95 declined to 14.8% from 15.7% 
in 1993-94 mainly because of a fall in public sector savings although 
private savings increased to 13.9% of GDP in 1994-95 from 13.1% of GDP 
in 1993-94.

<a name="saud">Saudi Companys thinking of cancelling sugar deals</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Syed Rashid Husain
RIYADH, Oct. 8: The Saudi Chambers of Commerce and Industry has warned 
the local Saudi traders against dealing with sugar traders in 
Pakistan, press reports indicate. Saudi trading houses have also been 
advised to review all their agreements with Pakistani trades dealing 
in sugar and exporting to Saudi Arabia.
In view of the above directive from the local chamber, Saudi companies 
are now thinking in terms of cancelling their agreements with 
Pakistani traders. Australia and Brazil are vying to take over the 
business lost by Pakistan.
The warning from the Saudi Chamber of Commerce and Industry was issued 
after the Government of Pakistan cancelled all valid export licenses 
issued to sugar plants and dealers and on the basis of which sugar 
exporters from Pakistan had entered into business deals with their 
Saudi counterparts.
Savola company one of the leading importers of sugar in the Kingdom 
and who are also putting up a sugar refinery in collaboration with a 
UK company, has already ceased dealings with Pakistan for its raw 
sugar requirements. It is now importing raw sugar from countries other 
than Pakistan in order to avoid losses because of sudden backing out 
of the exporter from the agreement. Such a situation may put in 
jeopardy the entire operation of big companies such as Savola. The 
Saudi market consumes about 480,000 tons of Sugar per annum. The total 
sugar required by the Kingdom is imported by five major companies from 
world markets and is then repackaged here for retail sales.
Saudi sugar traders have pointed out that such overnight changes in 
policy would affect the very credibility of Pakistani exporters and 
their Saudi counterparts would be reluctant to place orders in future 
with Pakistani traders. It shows a complete lack of planning and 
inventory management. Pakistani government officials should have 
properly projected the production and demand of sugar within Pakistan. 
Only after such an evaluation they should have issued licenses for 
export. But once these licenses were issued, the government should 
have honoured it. Such short-sighted decisions would have a bearing on 
Pakistans credibility and future exports.

<a name="rs50">Rs 50bn loss due to 15 strikes, says N D Khan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 9: Renewing his call to the MQM to resume negotiations 
aimed at restoring peace in Karachi, Federal Law Minister N.D. Khan 
claimed on Monday that people would reject Mian Nawaz Sharifs call to 
observe a black day on Oct 19.
Mr Khan said the economy suffered a loss of Rs.50 billion owing to 16 
strikes in Karachi. This, he said, exposed elements who were harming 
the national interests and pushing up inflation, prices and un-
employment.
Mr Khan, however, made it clear that the government will not bow to 
any pressure, nor will it be blackmailed to even consider any thing 
extra-constitutional in nature.

<a name="step">Steps to cut borrowings Fiscal situation to be monitored.</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Oct. 9: The government has authorised the State Bank to 
resort to some fiscal management measures to avert excessive 
borrowing if it found at the end of each month that expenditures had 
exceeded receipts, on pro rata basis.
Dr Masood said the government had asked all the big public sector 
bodies like, the WAPDA, PTC, State Bank and the collector of petroleum 
and gas surcharges, to make their payments which he called lumpy 
payments due to the government on monthly basis and we will enforce 
this rule as strictly as we do with tax collection.
He said after close analysis the government had come to the conclusion 
that bank borrowing should be monitored on monthly basis and income 
and expenditure managed on pro rata basis.
He maintained that the 1995-96 budget targets were achievable. We 
will meet the budgetary deficit target of 5 per cent and collect the 
estimated revenues of Rs270 billion and the autonomous bodies would 
earn enough profits to make their estimated contribution to the 
budget.
According to him the economy was not facing any structural problems. 
We are only facing a synchronisation problem. Nothing is wrong with 
our policy stance.
He attributed excessive borrowing in the first quarter of the current 
year partly to last years debt overhang.
Dr Ghafoor, additional secretary at the economic affairs division, who 
assisted Dr Waqar during the briefing, answering a question, said the 
serious depletion in foreign exchange reserves was due mainly to some 
major repayments in September and non-reporting of receipts of project 
and other foreign assistance in time. He rejected the suggestion that 
the depletion of the FE reflected the reported 20 per cent decline in 
exports, and said according to final estimates the decline in exports 
in this period was not more than 5 per cent.
Earlier, the prime ministers press assistant Farhatullah Baber, who 
opened the briefing, claimed that the state of the economy was not as 
bad as was being presented by way of the Press. He claimed that the 
positive aspects of the report were ignored by most of the newspapers.
He said while the government could not meet most of the economic 
targets set for last year, there was, however, a distinct overall 
improvement across the board compared to the situation obtaining in 
the previous three years.
Mr Babar conceded that during the first quarter of the current year, 
bank borrowing did actually reach a record Rs38 billion, but later, he 
claimed, it came down to Rs27 billion.
He said that the government did not dispute the inflation figures, and 
was doing everything possible to overcome the problem. But attributed 
part of the blame for high inflation to costly edible oil imports and 
partly to hoarding of sugar and other essential commodities.

<a name="worl">World Bank report lauds SAP</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Oct. 10: Pakistan is rated below countries with comparable 
economies, in the field of education, fertility, nutrition and health, 
according to a World Bank report on public and private initiatives, 
released on Tuesday.
It said that even after years of vigorous economic growth, Pakistans 
average family was large, poorly educated, undernourished and 
unhealthy. Female illiteracy is among the highest in the world and 
health, particularly in urban areas, is poor, the report said.  
Although 40% of Pakistani women wanted to avoid pregnancy, family 
planning services were weak and fertility rate was striking at 5.7%.
With the World Bank support, Pakistan had now embarked on the national 
Social Action Programme (SAP) that encouraged individual communities 
to improve social services themselves, with the ultimate aim of 
bringing the countrys social indicators into line with its high level 
of economic achievement, it said.
Projections suggested that returns on social investment in Pakistan, 
both social and economic, would almost certainly outstrip other types 
of investments, the report said.
Previous piecemeal attempts by the provinces, it said, had largely 
failed, forcing Pakistan to commit itself to increase national 
investment in the social service and to promote the ideal of smaller, 
healthier, better-fed and better-educated families.
Under the plan, Pakistan would decentralise the delivery of social 
services and clarify the various responsibilities of the four social 
service agencies. It would also enter into annual agreements with 
private sector providers, the performance of which would be assessed 
on the basis of detailed operational plans and measurable targets, the 
report said.
It said the most innovative feature of Pakistans SAP was its emphasis 
on participatory development. Through non-governmental organisations 
and other private institutions, the programme encouraged people to 
initiate projects to improve social service within their own 
community, the report added.
The participatory development programme, it said, would distribute $10 
million in grants to community organisations, non-governmental 
organisations, private institutions, foundations, academic and 
research organisations and government agencies that came up with 
community-based cost recovery schemes or ways to deliver services that 
were better suited to local needs. The report said about 10,000 NGOs 
were providing social services to communities throughout Pakistan and 
were in a better position to identify projects and to organise, run 
and mediate partnerships between small communities and the government.

<a name="bank">World Bank faces funding crisis</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
WASHINGTON, Oct 11: World Bank officials, facing a funding crisis of 
unprecedented proportions, are appealing to the United States not to 
shirk its responsibilities to the worlds 3 billion poor.
In his opening address to the Banks annual meeting, Wolfensohn made a 
direct appeal to the Republican-controlled Congress to reconsider 
reductions in the Banks International Development Association, which 
provides low-cost loans to the worlds 78 poorest countries.
He said threatened US cuts would likely be matched by other wealthy 
donor countries, resulting in a 50 % loss in planned IDA loans. He 
said for every dollar cut by the United States, IDA could lose a total 
of five dollars as other nations reduce their contributions 
proportionately, he said.
 While I cannot promise results, I can pledge our utmost effort to 
restore proposed congressional cuts, Rubin said.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 11: The United Group of Employees Management has 
expressed concern over an advertisement published in a leading 
newspaper about the sale of the United Bank and has asked the 
Privatisation Commission to implement its policy of golden hand-shake 
first.
In a statement, the UGEM also reminded the Privatisation Commission of 
its promise to offer the bank to the employees for its purchase before 
putting it for sale to others.
It also claimed that caution money of Rs 20,000 (non- refundable) was 
also deposited with the Privatisation Commission, and accordingly, the 
UGEM was the first party to deposit the amount and submit an 
application in this regard.
After depositing the amount, the UGEM asked for forms as per rules and 
regulations, but the request was turned down, stating that forms could 
be had by Oct 23. The advertisement, however, showed that forms could 
be obtained the same day when the caution money was deposited.  The 
refusal by the Privatisation Commission to give forms, according to 
its own condition in the advertisement, after depositing the amount 
showed violation of its own publication, the UGEM said.
The President of United Bank Employees Federation, Maqsood Ahmed 
Farooqi, and the Secretary-General of United Bank Officers Federation, 
Ghulam Ghouse Khan, also expressed concern over the sale 
advertisement.

<a name="bare">Bare bones  unrefuted</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee
THE penultimate paragraph of my September 1 column, The bare bones, 
quoting a sane senior Pakistani international civil servant, read: 
There is a risk that Pakistan will join the many countries in Africa 
and soon become one of the failed states. This risk draws closer every 
day. The real fear is that if things slide as they are doing, sometime 
early in the next century there may not be a State of Pakistan.
The conclusion was that I shared his foreboding, and I asked those who 
disagreed to write in. The letters of 13 of those who did write to the 
editor of this newspaper have been printed. Others have rung, and some 
have written to me directly (one without naming himself for reasons 
of security!). Only one man has disagreed with the prognosis  Nazim 
Haji, of the CPLC who by virtue of his chosen voluntary vocation lives 
close to reality, misery, deprivation, coercion, torture, wanton 
destruction and all that goes with them.
I disagree, he wrote, The way things are going, we will witness the 
disaster much earlier. We will be lucky to celebrate our 50th 
anniversary unless the silent majority (industrialists, traders, 
workers, professionals  lawyers, doctors, architects, etc  writers, 
enlightened politicians / civil servants / armed forces personnel, 
housewives, etc, etc) wakes up and, preferably jointly, fight for 
their rights.
Mr Abdullah Memon, in his letter, reminded us all that every dark 
night ends in a bright morning and asked If winter comes can spring 
be far behind? But, I remind him, that we are now at a stage where 
philosophical clichis and pirs can no longer help us.
Corruption: continues unabated and is aided and abetted by the 
higher-ups of the land. At a recent briefing of foreign Press 
correspondents, the question was asked of the prime minister whether 
she was aware that her country had been rated the third most corrupt 
country of the world. Rather than refute the rating, the prime 
minister held that some economists maintain that in developing 
countries corruption is a necessary evil that provides incentives for 
development. She may have picked up this idea from Joseph Nye, who 
accompanied US Defence Secretary William Perry on his visit to 
Pakistan. He once wrote that he thought that perhaps a little bit of 
corruption in developing countries, at a very low level, helped to 
push the file faster. By this, he did not mean institutionalised 
corruption at the topmost level that seeps all the way down to the 
bottom.
Accountability: Malik Mohammed Qasim, virtually the sole member of his 
party, the PML(Q), now in the PDF coalition, who heads the grand 
Federal Anti-Corruption Committee, goes after the helpless 
inconsequential and pursues those out of power. Should he not start in 
his own backyard, from atop his own ruling coalition, and move 
downwards. He keeps on complaining that the nationalised banks and 
DFIs are not cooperating with him. Does he not know who heads these 
institutions, and by whom these men were hand-picked? It is obvious 
that all talk of accountability is just a PR cover, a sheer pretence.
Exchange rate: When Jinnah made Pakistan, the US dollar was worth Rs 
3.3. The politicians of those days had concern for the country, and 
the dollar remained at this level until 1955 when a dollar could be 
bought for Rs 4.76. Thereafter, because of fiscal mismanagement and 
bad governance, it has cost us more and more. Since the beginning of 
this fiscal year (July 1) the rupee has lost 66 paisa against the 
dollar. On October 3, the SBP spot buying and selling rates were 
declared to be Rs 31.62 and Rs 31.7781. There is no apparent factor 
that can reassure us that the value of the rupee will not tumble 
further.
Growth: There is no entertainment or sport available to the awam other 
than procreation. For those with more in their pockets, there are 
other limited sports, but their main entertainment, apart from 
procreation, seems to be eating and watching the mini-screen, with 
much consequent damage to their general health and looks. The main 
growth in our country is bodies. We are listed third in world 
corruption and we are listed somewhere around third in population 
growth. These are our two great strengths. The government has finally 
admitted that we are compounding at the rate of well over 3.5 per cent 
per year. The money that is coming in from abroad for the control of 
our population is not being spent for that particular purpose. Into 
whose pockets is it flowing?
Education: with the population growth we have, it is impossible for 
the literacy rate to even remain steady. It has to decrease, and it is 
decreasing at an alarming rate. Educational standards are appalling. 
Educationalist Hikmat Khaleeli related a discussion he had some months 
ago with Terry Allsop, then a member of the Department of Education at 
Oxford, who has made a study of the levels of education in various 
countries. In Asia, our level is comparative with that in Outer 
Mongolia. And in Africa, we are on a par with Ethiopia. Should Shahnaz 
Wazir Ali, the prime ministers adviser on education, wish to increase 
her knowledge, she can contact Allsop, who now heads the African desk 
at the Overseas Development Authority in London.
The Iqra tax is variously and vigorously collected. The people, 
whether they like it or not, are taxed for education and pay as and 
where asked. Where does all this money go?
Health: If indeed there is a municipal health department in each city 
and town, the people are certainly not aware of them. Health officers 
there may be, who make money off their inspection of eating places and 
retailers of foodstuffs. Take Karachi  how many restaurants or 
snackbars approach the laid down standards of health and hygiene? We 
know of the deplorable conditions prevailing in government hospitals. 
We know of the shortage of life-saving drugs. As national health 
deteriorates, the demand for pharmaceutical products increases. Their 
quality and prices are controlled by the corrupt of the health 
ministry, the prices naturally covering the huge underhand outlays. 
Remember Kazmi, health minister of the first Benazir government. Is it 
true he is now living it up in Dallas?
Zakat: How much is arbitrarily deducted from the peoples bank 
accounts and from their various dividends? we do not know, and neither 
do we know where it all goes.
Taxes: Recently figures have been made public whereby it has been made 
amply evident that those that rule over us pay the least or no taxes 
at all. Much of the money collected is wasted on foreign junkets and 
ego trips for our notables, and much is used to maintain their 
inflated standard of living and playing. The sole point upon which the 
government and opposition are not at odds is the increase in their own 
salaries, allowances, and perks. A good deal is also siphoned through 
the various secret accounts, the spending and skimming from which 
are no secret from the enemy but only from us, the people. If the 
people cannot be told how their money is spent, these accounts should 
at least be listed with the names of their operators. At present, this 
secret fund money is spent without any check, let alone a counter-
check.
Environment: Any man with any sense, in or out of government, can, 
without fear of contradiction, hold that the first essential utility 
is potable water. Are our environmentalists in search of infinity 
aware of the percentage of the population that has no access to 
potable water? It is no use urging those who have no drinking water to 
plant and nurture trees.
Karachi: today, the most important factor. Panmunjong talks continue 
between the haves and the have-nots. The suffering of the underdog has 
not lessened at all. The prime minister, armed with her blunderbuss, 
seems to be convinced that the problem can be shot away and lost. 
Somewhat like East Pakistan?
Out of 273 days (from Jan 1 to Sep 30), Karachi remained closed for 
108 days  78 weekend closure, 14 holidays, 16 strikes (two of them 
government-inspired). Banks remained closed for 111 days (108 plus 
three: post-budget closing, yearly closing, and strike for Usman 
Ghanis slaying). The Stock Exchange was closed for 118 days (108 plus 
10: four Caliphs deaths, four members deaths, Shab-e-Barat, and 
Shab-e-Mairaj). The loss in GDP as a result of forced closures has 
been estimated at Rs 52 billion. (Source: Business Recorder, Oct 4).
Our taxes rise, our prices rise, inflation increases. Everything we 
get in return is on a continuing downslide, deteriorating in value and 
in standards. How long will it be before we are declared a failed 
state?

Cellular telephone technology was allowed into the country with much 
fanfare, in an attempt to usher in an era of high-tech, sophisticated 
telecommunications. However, July 2 1995 will forever be remembered as 
the darkest day in Telecom history when in an arbitrary manner the 
government thought it wise to ban the use of the pager, cellular 
phones and card telephones in Karachi. This will have far reaching 
consequences and is going to cost the government something that even a 
billion dollars will not buy its credibility.
According to a senior executive of Paktel who spoke on conditions of 
anonymity, Pakistan is not the only country in the world which has 
cellular phones and is beset with problems of urban terrorism. Sri 
Lanka is suffering from prolonged armed insurgency, even then the 
cellular phones are functioning. Yemen was the first country to 
suspend cellular phones and that was due to the civil war. Pakistan is 
the second country to do so, for reasons best known to the decision 
makers, as there has been no let-up in violence since the ban came 
into effect on July 2 1995.
The major losers in the game have been the dealers who had heavily 
invested in the industry. The nature of the investment is highly 
capital intensive, and all these dealer companies had raised huge 
amounts of loans. 
Approximately,40 to 45 per cent of earnings generate from Karachi 
alone and this ban has rendered a colossal loss to the exchequer, he 
went on to add.
The combined strength of all the three cellular phones in Karachi is 
approximately 25,000, rendering a loss in revenue of approximately Rs 
50 million per day, by way of dues to the PTC.
The 15,000 pagers operating in Karachi alone bring in a revenue of 
about Rs 1,20,000 per day to the PTC .
Taken together, the three cellular phone companies have so far 
invested at least Rs 6 billion in Pakistan. Another Rs 300 million was 
invested in setting up 1500 card telephones all over the city.
Karachi has always been a flagship city for any commercial activity. 
Allowing them to operate in other cities does not compensate in 
tangible terms to a lost out market.
When the entire world is edging towards high-tech communications it 
wont be long before we have to resort to Pigeons as our mode of 
sending messages. TJ.

<a name="sapm">SAP: myths and realities</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Akbar Sher Babar
RECENTLY, a number of articles have appeared reviewing the Social 
Action Programme. The reviews have dealt with issues such as Value of 
cost-effectiveness in service provision, user changes, public-
private partnership and sustainability of the Social Action 
Programme. None can deny the value of the issues addressed in the 
review.
A number of fallacies and myths are put forward by local and 
expatriate experts at seminars and workshops, occasions, which only 
serve the dual purpose of intellectual stimulation and some personal 
profit. For example, lack of parental support to promote primary 
education especially for girls is cited as one of the factors for low 
female literacy rate.
Unfortunately, the analyses of these experts do not highlight the 
critical factors which are the root cause of the slow pace of social 
development in Pakistan. The critical factors include the 
politicisation of the civil service and the strong influence of the 
donors to set development priorities and strategies which may or may 
not suit the local development environment.
Following are some of the symptoms of the politicisation of the civil 
service that are all too apparent in the development process: * Funds 
are allocated based on political rather than on professional or 
community requirements; * Site selection of schemes is subject to 
political interference; * Incorrect choice of technology, normally the 
more expensive the choice of technology the greater the returns to the 
planners and the implementers; * Lack of beneficiary involvement in 
the planning and implementation of development schemes; and * Frequent 
transfers of government officials resulting in complete paralysis of 
line departments.
Gross misuse of the available development funds are allocated based on 
the influence the politicians have at the national, provincial, or 
local levels. Huge financial outlays under the MNA, MPA, and Senator 
funds are used for political patronage and personal profit. Some of 
these funds are distributed to preferred individuals/groups under the 
pretext of small development schemes which varies in amount from Rs. 
10,000 to Rs. 20,000. At the local level, simple decisions such as 
setting of, schools, rural water supply schemes, and rural health 
centres are based on political considerations rather than professional 
or community welfare. Most of these facilities lack any staff to 
operate and/or are completely devoid of any facilities essential for 
utilisation of those facilities. As a consequence a number of such 
facilities built for peoples welfare are used as guest houses by 
local influential or to house livestock. Thus, huge investments in the 
construction of primary schools, basic health units, rural health 
centres, and rural water supply schemes have had little or no 
beneficial impact on the target communities.
Under the present circumstance, the allocation of greater financial 
resources for capital and O&M costs will only result in more pilferage 
of the same without any major change in the social indicators.
In principle the collaboration between the private sector/NGOs and the 
government should be encouraged wherever considered cost effective. 
However, it should not be made an excuse to absolve the government of 
its primary role of service delivery. Neither should private 
sector/NGOs be considered an alternative to the Government in 
providing such service. The NGOs natural inclination is to cater to 
the urban population. There are considerable doubts about the capacity 
of the NGOs to cater to the needs of the rural poor on a scale that 
could result in any improvement in the poor social indicators. 
Therefore, the only viable and cost effective option for social change 
is a fully mobilised and committed government system in partnership 
with credible NGO/private groups.
To date, the donors have made no serious attempt at the policy level 
to address the issue of politicisation of the civil service and its 
extremely adverse impact on service delivery.

<a name="thed">The dynamics of revolution</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Mazdak
It often seems that the distance from Karachis killing fields to 
Defence and Clifton is the same as the long miles to Islamabad.
In both of Pakistans pockets of affluence, there is the same lack of 
understanding of the dynamics of the situation in Karachi, and the 
same baffled irritation at the MQM for not falling in line. As the 
weekly strikes bite deep into the economy as well as the nerves and 
pockets of rich and poor Karachiites alike, a weary nation silently 
cries Enough! But the government is clearly playing a waiting game, 
trying to lock up or kill enough hard-core members of the ethnic party 
to make it reduce its long list of demands before signing an 
agreement.
The MQM, for its part, is determined to keep the city on edge through 
its weekly strikes and hit-and-run tactics. We, the blood-spattered 
audience and victims, want them both to stop the fight and accept a 
draw, but in the absence of a referee, the fighters continue to slug 
it out.
The government, sitting comfortably and safely in Islamabad, or 
whizzing past with armed escorts in Karachi, can afford the luxury of 
wearing the MQM down. Its biggest concern is not with the lives or the 
livelihood of individual victims, but with declining revenues and 
cancelled MOUs. As long as the macro- economic indicators are within 
acceptable limits, the government feels it has enough time to stall. 
The MQM, for its part, has very little to lose because it can force 
the city to come to a standstill once a week through the fear it has 
spread. In fact, people are coming to terms with weekly strikes.
What is at the root of this implacable determination? What prompts the 
Mohajirs of Sindh to vote for the MQM time and again? Arif Hasan, in a 
long and perceptive article in the September issue of the monthly 
Herald, has gone to the heart of the matter. Mr Hasan is ideally 
qualified for analysing the situation, According to him, what we are 
witnessing in Karachi today is a major conflict between the evolving 
urban capitalist culture of the city and its development plus 
operations and maintenance requirements on the one hand, and the 
nature of the Pakistan state and the system of patronage, nepotism, 
adhocism, corruption, parochialism and exploitation that are integral 
to it, on the other hand.
This may be a long and involved sentence, but it underlines the 
essence of the deadlock: the state is unwilling to countenance the 
emergence of a system based on merit and competition  the core of the 
urban, capitalist culture  because it would cut across, and 
ultimately replace, the network of relatives and cronies who support 
and sustain the present dispensation. To substantiate his argument, Mr 
Hasan has given details of the all-pervasive system of extortion, 
bribery and sifarish on which virtually all business transactions in 
the city are based where the vast public sector is concerned. No 
beggar, no street seller and no small businessman can operate without 
paying off the cops. Nobody can supply goods and services to the 
provincial or federal government in Karachi without bribing a 
succession of officials and politicians and their touts. No young 
graduate can hope to get a government job without sifarish or a bribe. 
Usually, both are needed. Whether it is credit from the House Building 
Finance Corporation to build a house, or an electricity connection 
>from  KESC, nothing moves without a bribe. And the situation is worse 
in the katchi abadis where the poorest of the poor live.
So why should these well-known, deeply-entrenched problems give rise 
to the quasi-civil war that is taking place in Karachi? Mr Hasan 
reminds us that this inability to compete on merit and exercise ones 
entrepreneurial skills have been responsible for many bourgeois 
revolutions in nineteenth and early twentieth century Europe. In 
Karachi, these economic and social forces have been given an ethnic 
edge by the historical coincidence that concentrated Indian Muslims 
and their descendants here in such large numbers. Mr Hasan ascribes 
the large MQM vote bank in Karachi to the middle class leadership of 
the party which is in sharp contrast to the feudal nature of other 
mainstream parties, as a result of which they do not address the 
problems of the working classes. The second reason is that in the 
absence of an institutional framework that protects the poor from 
exploitation, they group together to forge ethnic bonds as a way to 
protect themselves from the state and its predatory agents.
The Karachi situation is part of the larger crisis looming across the 
Pakistani horizon. With the consolidation of capitalist farming, 
urbanisation and increased literacy, the old pattern of inter-class 
relations has changed. Ethnic groups and communities to whom history 
had assigned specific roles are now competing with communities and 
groups that were more advanced than them. In the absence of 
appropriate institutional arrangements to deal with this situation, 
the old institutions have become irrelevant and ineffective, and hence 
corrupt...

<a name="orde">Ordeal of ID cards</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
COMPLAINTS have been mounting about the hassles involved in securing 
national identity cards. While the rightful seekers of ID cards find 
it extremely difficult to obtain them, there are hosts of unauthorised 
people in possession of genuine or fake cards. Since 1973 when this 
scheme was introduced in the country, corruption made deep inroads 
into the different layers of the organisational set-up.
Initially, the application forms were meant to be freely available; 
now they are not. Touts and agents supply them at a price depending on 
the urgency of need or the financial capacity of the applicants. The 
forms are to be submitted at designated registration offices. In most 
cases, because of a huge rush, applicants fail to reach the windows 
meant for receiving applications. If they somehow manage to submit 
their forms, often they are not issued a proper receipt. Instead, they 
are asked to present themselves at the same counter after about a week 
to be told whether or not their forms are in order. Even at that stage 
they are confronted with many real or imaginary objections. In sheer 
desperation, they eventually seek the assistance of agents who hang 
around registration offices and flourish on the miseries of the 
helpless ID card seekers.
The national identity card scheme was launched primarily with two 
objectives: to ensure accuracy of census and to check the influx of 
illegal immigrants. Neither has been achieved. Many ID cards are 
issued without proper verification.
According to a report, in Karachi alone over ten million ID cards have 
so far been issued although the number of eligible nationals is much 
less. As ID card is the basic document for identification of an 
individual and for the exercise of his rights as a bona fide national, 
many unauthorised persons have obtained it through questionable means. 
Besides identification, the card is needed for enrolment on voters 
lists, recruitment in government, semi-government and private 
services, elimination of fake witnesses in courts, obtaining passports 
or any other national documents, getting admission in educational 
institutions and making any business deal. It is ironical that while 
obtaining an ID card has become an ordeal for genuine citizens, an 
estimated three million non-nationals are believed to be in illegal 
possession of it.
Most problems associated with the issuance of the ID card emanate from 
administrative and procedural weaknesses. In the beginning, 
registration offices all over the country were set up district-wise. 
But this arrangement has proved totally inadequate. Police 
verification of individual cases must also be made an expeditious 
process. To make these measures workable, efficient organisational 
set-up will be required. Only then can securing the ID card be made a 
reasonably painless process.</pre><pre>

<a name="thep">The PPP in Punjab: staving off the inevitable</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir
WHETHER the PPP has its own chief minister presiding over the 
corruption-ridden politics of Punjab, a possibility mercifully 
averted, or whether it appoints another senior minister with 
plenipotentiary powers, Punjab is a lost cause for it. That is the 
writing on the wall and if Ms Bhutto of the regal and blithe manner 
chooses to ignore it so much the worse for the future of her party.
It is not even fair to say that the PPP lost Punjab in 1993 or 1988 
for that matter. Paradoxically, the partys decline in the powerhouse 
of Pakistani politics began on the day Ms Bhutto, after capping the 
period of her self-imposed exile, arrived in Lahore on the morning of 
April 10, 1986. The ecstatic welcome she received on that occasion 
almost lent substance to the impression that all of Punjab lay at her 
feet. 
But by moving systematically from the left to the centre and then even 
further to the right and by picking flunkies and hangers-on to head 
the partys affairs in the province she set in motion that chain of 
events which has seen a drastic loss of support for the party at the 
grass-roots level. It still has a vote bank but over the years this 
has shrunken in size to the point that today, if one is to go by the 
evidence of ones senses, it is significantly smaller than that of the 
PML(N).
Anyone inclined to dispute this judgement should take time out to 
visit the Punjab countryside. The opprobrium which the present PPP 
government has managed to accumulate for itself, whether because of 
its record or the tales of high corruption surrounding its leaders, 
will come as a great eye-opener.
Nawaz Sharif was not a particularly successful prime minister either 
but this much can be said for him that because of some of his 
development plans he had come to be seen in the public eye as a man of 
action, as someone who wanted to do something for the country. Most of 
those schemes might not stand up to critical scrutiny but they served 
their purpose by influencing the current of public opinion. 
Ms Bhutto, on the other hand, cannot claim credit for a single policy 
or development scheme which could win public approval for her. On the 
contrary, she is held directly responsible for the inflation and 
maladministration now holding the country in their thrill.
There is a misconception about political patronage which has acquired 
wide currency and which lies behind much of the manoeuvring which the 
nation has recently witnessed in Punjab. It consists of the belief 
that the doling out of patronage can win popular support. The evidence 
of Pakistani history should belie this judgement because the people 
time and again, whether in the Ayub era or subsequently, have 
responded not to the blandishments of pork but to appeals addressed to 
their inner-most feelings. 
This is how Bhutto and Mujib rode the crest of popular sympathy in 
1970. Even if it be thought that the era of charismatic politics in 
Pakistan is over it is still instructive to bear in mind that Nawaz 
Sharifs present popularity owes little to the fact that he held the 
purse-strings of Punjab in his hands during the period of his chief 
ministership. It stems more from the way he defied Ghulam Ishaq Khan 
in 1993.
Or consider Wattoos case. A prince of patronage before his fall. 
Practically a nonentity now. Which does not mean that patronage is of 
no account in politics. Only this that it can never be a substitute 
for popular policies. In order to believe in a leader the people must 
feel that he or she belongs to them.
It is Ms Bhuttos singular accomplishment that despite the legacy of 
her father, who blazed new trails in popular politics, she has removed 
herself from the pale of public sympathy. Five years ago who could 
have thought that Nawaz Sharif, rising to political prominence from 
the bosom of a military dictatorship, could ever take her place? 
Today, however, if there is a popular leader in Punjab it is not 
Zulfikar Ali Bhuttos daughter but, come to think of it, Mian Mohammad 
Sharifs son. No amount of patronage doled out in Punjab is going to 
alter this fact, at least not till the next elections.
But then how are we to account, the sceptically-inclined might ask, 
for Benazirs second coming as prime minister? After all, defying past 
trends, she is the only leader in Pakistan to have staged a comeback. 
An explanation for this phenomenon must be sought in her stars and the 
ill-luck of her predecessor who invited tragedy for himself by picking 
an unnecessary quarrel with his protector, the then President Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan. 
This explanation, admittedly, is a thin one because what counts in 
politics, as indeed in life, is success and not how one comes by it. 
Still, to the extent that it indicates that Ms Bhuttos second 
ascension to power has little to do with any rise in her popularity, 
it remains relevant to the predicament her party faces in Punjab.
To go over the reasons for the precipitous decline in the PPPs Punjab 
fortunes amounts to beating a dead horse. Not only are these reasons 
well known to the initiated. They are engraved in iron on the souls of 
the partys disaffected workers whose eyes were set on the promised 
land when Benazir returned to Pakistan in 1986. Suffice it to say that 
the PPPs fate was sealed when a second-ranking carpetbagger like 
Jehangir Badr was appointed to run its affairs in Punjab. If anything 
could have taken that process further it was the Lady Nahid Khans 
apotheosis as virtual boss of the provincial party during Benazirs 
second prime ministership. It would be silly to deny that Nahid has 
her qualities and uses but to make her the virtual keeper of the 
partys keys is a blow not so much to its dispirited battalions as to 
the memory of the partys founder. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto may have 
deserved many things but not this.
Into what precise events the partys decline is translated in the 
future remains to be seen because predicting the course of Pakistani 
politics is a hazardous business. There has never been an orderly or 
strictly constitutional transfer of power in Pakistan before and, 
given the state of our democracy, it is tempting the fates to say that 
there will be one when the term of the present government draws to a 
close. Even so, what we are seeing is a watershed of sorts with a 
political party which has left its mark on Pakistani politics losing 
its mass appeal through a natural process and being replaced in the 
popular mind by a rejuvenated Muslim League. Come the next elections 
and this transformation should change the political landscape of 
Pakistan provided no miracles intervene.
In this analysis (if it can be dignified by that name there are no 
lessons for the PPP because the PPP of Asif Ali Zardari and the Lady 
Nahid are beyond correcting and improving. Nothing can swerve it from 
the self-defeating course it is set on. But there are lessons for the 
PML(N) which would do both itself and the people of the country a 
favour if it forswore the tactics of empty agitation (such as the 
Tehrik-i-Nijat last year which exposed its hollow threats) and set its 
eyes instead on preparing for the next elections. For unruly 
politicians intent on reaping quick harvests this is probably a tall 
order. But waiting for the next elections is not only a requirement of 
our erratic and fragile democracy. It is also a dictate of necessity. 
Through its ill-conceived campaign last year the PML(N) tried its best 
to force the issue but as even a half-informed observer might have 
warned it, its bringing-the-government-down movement fizzled out 
leading to exhaustion and demoralisation in its ranks and a feeling of 
triumph on the part of the government. If nothing else this proves 
that as with the PPP the level of everyday discernment in the PML(N) 
is also quite low.
The real problem before the country, however, is not who wins power in 
Punjab but how this power is used to modernise the archaic structure 
of the Pakistani state. In the latest issue of the monthly Herald, 
Arif Hasan perceptively points out that the aspirations of the lower 
middle and working classes are increasingly in conflict with the 
nature of the Pakistani state and its hallmarks of patronage, 
nepotism, adhocism, corruption, parochialism and exploitation. What to 
talk of the will to settle this conflict, the PPP has not even the 
barest understanding of it. Can the PML(N), the alternative on the 
national stage, do any better? That, and not just the acquisition of 
power, is the true challenge facing its leadership.

<a name="nota">Not a clean bill of health</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
CONCERN has rightly been expressed by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) 
over the intensification of inflationary pressure during the last 
fiscal year. What is more worrying is the feet that it shows no signs 
of 
abating. The year 1994-95 to which the State Bank's Annual Report, 
released on Sunday, relates was a year of failure in achieving most of 
the key sector targets although the economy did register improvements 
in many areas. However, the, most depressing aspect remains the rising 
prices. The Report records anxiety over the failure to reduce the rate 
of action to the targeted 7%. Instead, the consumer price index (CPI) 
registered an increase of 12.9% which was perhaps the highest increase 
in Pakistan's history. This country has always experienced moderate 
inflation. The present trend of high inflation rate started in 1990-91 
when the CPI touched 12.7% mark and since then has refused to relent.  
Analysing, the causative factors, the State Bank has blamed low 
economic growth, large budgetary deficit, high monetary expansion and 
increases in administered prices of food items and in charges of 
utilities for 
the intensification of inflationary pressure. The government failed to 
reduce the deficit - the main cause of inflation - to the targeted 
level of 4% of the GDP, although it may be said to its credit that it 
succeeded in bringing it down from 8%, which it had inherited in 1993, 
to 5.5% last year. The continuing wide gap between resources and 
expenditure made it necessary for the government to have resort to the 
banking system for budgetary support far in excess of the original 
target of Rs 15 billion. 
Throughout the year the governments borrowing remained higher than 
the previous year's total borrowing of Rs 19 billion. Apart from bank 
borrowing, the deficit was also covered by the utilisation of a part 
of the privatisation proceeds. These actions contributed to the 
monetary expansion which was further strengthened by borrowing by 
public sector corporations and a substantial increase in lending by 
the Agricultural Development Bank and the Small Business Corporation 
under the government-sponsored credit schemes.
Major failure occurred in revenue collection which registered a 
shortfall of Rs 39 billion. Pakistan has never had a proper tax 
culture. It inherited from the colonial rulers a state which was 
looked upon as oppressive and not at all interested in the welfare of 
the people. Unfortunately, this perception of the state being 
oppressive and 
indifferent to public welfare still persists despite the lapse of half 
a century. In recent years the alienation has been further accentuated 
by acute maldistribution of income due to pervasive corruption and 
inequitable incidence of taxes. 
Not only that those who legislate taxes exempt major sources of their 
own income; they do not even care to pay whatever little they are 
liable to pay. In such an environment the rulers lack the necessary 
moral 
strength to enforce fulfilment of tax obligations. Unless all incomes, 
including agricultural incomes, are brought within the tax net and 
privileges are eliminated, budget deficit will continue to stay at an 
unacceptable level. What is more, there is no visible reduction in 
government's lavish and ostentatious spending. These factors led to 
the failure in raising the contribution of taxes to the contemplated 
20% of the GDP. The enlarged budget deficit had to be met from 
domestic and foreign borrowings. Such borrowings over the last many 
years have landed Pakistan into a debt-trap where it has to borrow to 
service old loans. The total national debt, as of June 30 last, stood 
at Rs 1,556.6 billion - Rs 796.8 billion being domestic - and 
constituted 83.3% of the GDP. The servicing of this huge debt is 
inconsistent with the existing 
revenue generation scope of the state. The State Bank has, therefore, 
strongly advocated the enlargement of the coverage of income and 
consumption taxes. In order to contain the effect of these taxes on 
inflation, production needs to be exempted or taxed lightly and 
selectively, while consumption has to be taxed widely but at low 
rates. All taxes must be collected efficiently and unsparingly. High 
increases in utility charges and prices of food items and petroleum 
products have contributed heavily to inflation.  
Notwithstanding the internal financial imbalances, the balance of 
payments improved during the year under review on account of increases 
in exports by about 18% against previous year's negative 1.4% and in 
expatriates remittances by 20%. Deregulation of investment and 
liberalisation of exchange controls created a favourable environment 
for foreign - investment which increased by more than 100% to $1.53 
billion. Imports also increased by almost the same ratio as exports. 
The welcome aspect of imports has been a greater inflow of capital 
goods mainly because of the current emphasis on power generation and 
encouragement of export-oriented and technology-packed industries. The 
disconcerting aspect, however, is the decline in domestic savings. 
This decline is largely due to substantial dissaving in the public 
sector, mainly because of the budget deficit. This deficit has to be 
controlled if development is to be sustained and inflation brought 
under control.

Editorial Column
THE federal commerce minister's appeal to the people to help eradicate 
corruption is not the first time a public leader has harped on this 
theme. The widespread prevalence of corruption in Pakistan and the 
need for rooting it out are favourite topics of discussion, especially 
among the higher echelons of leadership. Chaudhri Ahmad Mukhtar has 
taken the plea that the government cannot deal with this menace 
single-handedly. He has placed the onus of bringing honest leaders 
into office on the public. With Pakistan having been assessed as being 
one of the most corrupt countries in the world by the Berlin based 
Transparency International, one would fault Ahmad Mukhtar's concern on 
this score. One can, however, well ask him why the government of which 
the honourable minister is a member cant do something about the 
corrupt practices of its own high functionaries.  
The facts is that broadly streaking, the corruption one sees in public 
life is of two kinds. One is that practised by the administration in 
the course of performing its duties. At times the gratification an 
official 
seeks is in essence a glorified tip which he demands almost as a 
matter of right for doing a certain job promptly and efficiently.  The 
bureaucrats are also known for bending the laws for monetary gains, 
political favours and nepotism. The other corruption is the one in 
which the political leaders indulge to amass a fortune while they are 
in a position to do so. Obviously, the members of a ruling party, 
especially  holding an office of importance, have greater 
opportunities for featherbedding. What needs to be emphasised is that 
the corruption of the political leaders is the bigger of the two evils 
because it sets the tone and pace for the lower functionaries. A 
corrupt leader has no moral standing to check the wrong doings of his 
subordinates. On the contrary, he has perforce to give protection to 
the corrupt in his department to save his own skin.
With corruption flowing from top downwards, it is at that level that 
any move to contain the spreading scourge must begin. Given the 
exorbitant amounts politicians are required to spend on their 
elections, it is not quite surprising (though not justifiable) that 
many of them want to make most of their opportunities for self-
gratification while the sun shines on their political fortunes. It is 
plain that the rule imposing a ceiling of one million rupees on the 
election expenses of an MNA is flouted blatantly. With politics turned 
into of a money game in Pakistan; corruption has emerged as an 
integral part of the post-election scenario. The compulsion for an 
elected leader to make money can be somewhat eased if the election 
rules are changed and the money factor in politics ceases to be a 
prime determinant.  
There is also the need to strengthen the mechanisms for weeding out 
corruption. Some institutions already exist for this purpose. These 
include the Federal Anti-Corruption Committee and the ombudsman. They 
need to be activated further to make them effective against corruption 
among politicians and in government. The government should also take 
the initiative to set up a body comprising honest and public-spirited 
non-government figures to expose corruption and generate pressure for 
its eradication. The media can also play an important role in this 
context. But without a public agency of the kinds suggested above, the 
newspapers often find themselves exposed to pressures and intimidation 
by the tainted among the rulers and their minions. Since there are 
members of the government who have started stressing the need for 
crusading against corruption, one can hope that they will not hesitate 
to act to prevent and control it. Even if it means risking the wrath 
of the powerful in doing so, one hopes that the few honest politicians 
who are still around will act to bring some decency and propriety to 
politics.

Editorial Column
CONSIDER or perhaps weigh the following nuggets of news and you will 
get an idea of the sum total of doom being employed to come to grips 
with the problem of Karachi. Shazia Farooq, wife of the late Farooq 
Dada, is released after being kept in custody from the time her 
husband died. The confiscated passport of Sheikh Liaquat Hussain, a 
member of MQM negotiating team, is to be returned to him. The police 
will again 
provide protection to the MQM negotiating team. These are some of the 
steps the government is taking in order to facilitate the resumption 
of the stalled talks with the MQM. The magnitude of these steps may 
bring 
a wry look on the face of the bemused observer but then in a hopeless 
situation it is churlish not to be grateful for small mercies.  
All the pleas made by the national Press for a greater element of 
seriousness and sincerity to enter the talks between the government 
and the MQM have fallen largely on deaf ears. The way the talks have 
progressed so far (if progress indeed is the right word to use in the 
circumstances) is reminiscent of the talks that used to be held at the 
height of the cold war between North and South Korea along their 
common 
border. After reading lengthy wooden statements the two sides would 
disperse to meet again. Everyone concerned speaks solemnly and even 
pretentously about the Karachi situation but little of these feelings 
permeate the negotiations being conducted (and then broken off) by 
both sides. Professional casuists would no doubt be thrilled by the 
passion for hair-splitting on ample display in these talks but not 
anyone 
concerned about the unrest and violence playing havoc with Karachi.  
There is, of course, no shortage around of pious intentions. When 
President Farooq Leghari was in Karachi earlier this week, he said 
things which would find a ready echo in the hearts of most 
Karachiites. Stressing the need for a genuine and meaningful dialogue 
to resolve the problems of Karachi, he expressed concern about the 
high-handedness that often takes place when the police and the Rangers 
lay siege to entire localities and make indiscriminate arrests. Such 
practices, he said, would prove counter-productive and would alienate 
the people because any anti-terrorist strategy must lie within the 
ambit of the rule of law. These are sensible and wise words but to 
listen to them on one side and then to see the reality of Karachi on 
the other makes us wonder whether there is any communication between 
the various organs of the state.  
General Babar may have brought a fierce single-mindedness to the fight 
against violence in Karachi but it is a moot point whether he is at 
all capable of realising the extent of the resentment being caused in 
that city as a result of the excesses often committed by the law 
enforcement agencies. Breaking the law in order to uphold the majesty 
of the law is one contradiction in terms that we would do well to 
avoid. At the same time, the MQM must cast an eye over its chosen 
tactics to put pressure on the government. Not only that Karachi has 
had enough of strikes and the disruptions and losses that they entail, 
and could do without them in the future. The frequent resort to them, 
>from  the standpoint of practicality, dilutes their efficaciousness. 
The MQM speaks for the majority of the population of Karachi. There is 
no need to prove this point every other day. But then both sides, 
sadly are set on parallel courses. If only at some point (through a 
miracle we have yet to know anything about) their disparate paths 
could converge.

<a name="atta">Attack on Sindh Secretariat</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ALTHOUGH Karachi has lived with violence for a long time, there are 
certain designated areas of the city, where most of this violence has 
been regularly played out. The precision rocket attacks at the very 
heart of the Sindh government break this complacent pattern and cast 
wry light on the claims of various government stalwarts, not least 
among them the redoubtable General Babar, that the back of terrorism 
(an increasingly fashionable phrase these days) has been broken.
In a manner to vivid for comfort, the rockets fired at the Sindh 
Secretariat bring home the harsh reality with which Karachi has been 
struggling for the last so many years. It is no small cause for 
thanksgiving that the damage has not been greater than it is or that 
no lives were lost in what easily could have-turned into a wider 
catastrophe.  
But these considerations apart, this attack, its dramatic impact on 
the public imagination not withstanding, is no more serious or heinous 
than the daily killings which take place in the troubled parts of 
Karachi. 
Consequently, it is not the firing of the rockets themselves that 
should be the major object of our concern. Concern should rather be 
centred on the fact that urban terrorism has dug deep roots in the 
country's largest city. As long as this tragic phenomenon persists and 
as long as innocent people get killed (to the extent that if only five 
people are gunned down in Karachi on any given day instead of a dozen 
it is considered a sign of normality) there is no saying what ugly or 
still more dramatic forms this terrorism will take.
Nor do these rockets alter the importance of what we on our part or 
concerned citizens on theirs have been saying all along: that it is 
not by the use of palliatives or the thunder of empty words that the 
gathering mayhem in Karachi can be contained but by the exercise of 
political will of the most serious kind at the highest levels of 
government. What is happening in Karachi, or rather to Karachi, is 
central to the well-being of the country. If this realisation does not 
sink in or, in other words, if we remain bereft of vision as all the 
current signs indicate we are, then all we can look forward to is more 
hair-splitting and more time-wasting along the lines of what the 
nation has been treated to during the course of the talks between the 
government and the MQM.
Who is behind the rocket attacks is an important question but one 
whose importance must be kept in perspective. When a fire is raging 
there is not much point in blaming this or that piece of incendiary 
material 
for the conflagration. The problem in Karachi today is to strike at 
the roots of its distress, not just attack the symptoms. In this 
connection it is worth pointing out that General Babar is doing a 
soldier's duty in Karachi. 
In the prevailing lawlessness of the city this is perhaps a necessary 
function to perform. But it is scarcely enough. To the distress of 
Karachi must also be applied the balm of statesmanship, something that 
we find woefully lacking in the ongoing tragedy of this once peaceful 
city.

<a name="dang">Danger alert by State Bank</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed
WITH its history of dominance in too many areas, the government could 
not have liked the State Banks disapproval of its fiscal and monetary 
policies, and the underscoring of a critical situation the nation 
could face unless urgent remedial measures were taken.
Had the situation been not so bad, the Banks board of directors, 
which consists mostly of officials like finance secretary or retired 
senior officials would not have adopted this kind of annual report. In 
fact what the report says is the same that the IMF, World Bank, donor 
states and sane economists at home have all along been putting their 
finger on.
Of course, the Benazir government could not be blamed exclusively for 
the parlous state of the economy with many seemingly unsolvable 
problems. Many of them are legacies of previous regimes, but have 
definitely aggravated during the present governments tenure 
particularly after the ill-advised over-taxation it resorted to last 
year. It failed in it and fell out with the IMF which stopped payment 
of further tranches of the 1.5 billion dollar aid stretched over three 
years under its Extended Structural Adjustment facility.
Surely, problems like the large budget deficit, sustained heavy 
official borrowing, staggering national debt which has mounted to Rs 
1,554.6 billion now, and large bank loan defaults are the result of 
the overhang of many years as the State Bank likes to describe it in 
its Annual Report for 1994-95. The situation is so bad that even the 
much-dreaded public disclosure of the names of the defaulters has not 
resulted in the recovery of more than 15 per cent of the loans two 
years after the lists were out.
The report says that despite the impact of inflation, the people have 
done far better than the government. Private savings rose from 13.1 
per cent of the GDP to 13.9 per cent but public savings dropped from 
2.6 per cent to 0.9 per cent. As a result, national savings came down 
>from  15.7 per cent to 14.8 per cent, marking area increase of just 1.8 
per cent if adjusted for 13 per cent inflation.
Home remittances by overseas Pakistanis rose to 1,866 million dollars 
>from  1,446 million dollars in 1993-94. Pakistanis have kept around 
four billion dollars in the foreign exchange accounts in our banks, 
enabling the government to claim a large foreign exchange reserve, 
contrary to the practice of many countries not to treat short-term 
deposits as the nations reserve.
The SBP wants the government to reduce the budget deficit by 
increasing the real revenues and not by printing more currency notes, 
as has been done for many years. It wants broad-based taxation, which 
should include the large incomes from agriculture. While the 
government is agreeable to that in principle, it is not ready to move 
firmly in that direction and the Constitution helps the farmlords to 
avoid taxes. 
What we have is a highly tangled taxation structure, made far worse by 
corruption of a high level, and the sustained inflation and steady 
devaluation makes investment even more expensive. The SBP also wants 
the government to cut its non-productive and wasteful expenditure, and 
stresses that bank borrowing for its current consumption is even more 
inflationary than if that is spent on development.
It is not that inflation, large budget deficits and unrestrained 
printing of money hurt only the public; its hurts the government as 
well when it is forced to raise the wages of its employees 
substantially, and levy additional taxation to pay the higher wage 
bill which causes public protests. 
The SBP report says, the government is also using the proceeds of 
privatisation to meet its expenditure. Hence instead of using that 
fund to lower the pyramiding national debt it will use Rs 12 billion 
>from  that for the Social Action Programme after it had used Rs 11 
billion last year and Rs 2 billion the year before. And it depends on 
foreign and domestic loans for funding the Annual development 
Programme.</pre><pre><hr>

Special Representative
SHARJAH, Oct 11: Pakistans hopes of regaining the title they last won 
in 1989 received a setback when speed merchant Wasim Akram was ruled 
out of competition because of `frozen shoulder.
Paceman Ataur Rahman, who was named in the stand-byes, has been 
selected as Akrams replacement and he is scheduled to arrive late 
Wednesday evening.
Mushtaq mentioned, the decision has been taken with a view of the 
tough tour Down Under. Had Akram aggravated the injury, he would have 
been unable to tour Australia and New Zealand. We can afford to play 
without him here but not in Australia.
Akram last played for Pakistan in the second Test against Sri Lanka at 
Faisalabad. In that Test, the allrounder sustained the unique injury 
which forced him to pull out of the third Test at Sialkot as well as 
the one-day series.
Mushtaq, asked to comment on tomorrows game, said it was crucial in 
terms of regaining the shattered confidence. The players are 
determined to do well but in one-day cricket you just cant predict.
The former Pakistan captain added that all the players were in fine 
physical condition.
While saying that the playing eleven will be announced shortly before 
the start of the match, Mushtaq added the team will be a combination 
of five batsmen, five bowlers and a wicketkeeper.
There are indications that Basit Ali will sit out and Saeed Anwar will 
bat at No 5. Aamir Sohail and Salim Elahi will open the innings and 
Ramiz Raja and Inzamamul Haq will bat at No 3 and 4 respectively.
Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmad is also expected to miss the match. Saqlain 
Mushtaq, Waqar Younis, Mohammad Akram, Aqib Javed and Zafar Iqbal will 
form the bowling combination.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan opener Roshan Mahanama will also sit out from 
Thursdays match after he sustained, what the management think, groin 
injury. His place is likely to be taken by Chandika Hathurusinghe who 
had a successful tour of Pakistan in which he scored 291 runs with the 
bat. He, however, did not play in the one-day series.
The two teams will be selected from:
SRI LANKA: Sanath Jayasuriya, Chandika Hathurusinghe, Asanka 
Gurusinha, Aravinda de Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga (captain), Hashan 
Tillekeratne, Rumesh Kaluwitharna, Rawan Kalpage, Muttiah 
Muralitharan, Pramodiya Wickremasinghe, Kumar Dharmasena, Eric 
Upashanta, Wendell Labrooy, Roshan Mahanama.
PAKISTAN: Aamir Sohail, Salim Elahi, Ramiz Raja (captain), Inzamamul 
Haq, Saeed Anwar, Moin Khan, Zafar Iqbal, Waqar Younis, Saqlain 
Mushtaq, Aqib Javed, Mohammad Akram, Mushtaq Ahmad, Basit Ali and 
Ataur Rahman.</pre>
