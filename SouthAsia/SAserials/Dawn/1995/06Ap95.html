Bureau Report 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 3: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has welcomed  
opposition leader Nawaz Sharif's offer of co-operation to resolve the  
Karachi crisis and informed him that she would meet him on her return  
from  the United States. 
 
"I will be leaving for the United States shortly and would like to meet  
you on my return at a mutually convenient time so that we can together  
can examine your offer of co-operation", Ms Bhutto said in a letter  
written to Mr Sharif on Sunday and released on Monday. 
 
Ms Bhutto is leaving on a nine day trip to the United States on Tuesday.
 
Mr Sharif, who recently met MQM chief Altaf Hussain in London, had  
written a letter to the Prime Minister on Saturday, offering his co- 
operation to resolve the Karachi crisis. 
 
In his letter, released by the PML on Monday, Mr Sharif asked Ms Bhutto  
to bring the MQM back into the national political mainstream to remove  
the sense of political and psychological alienation of the people of  
Karachi. 
 
He had also expressed his disappointment at the speech of the Prime  
Minister made over radio and television in which she had asked Mr Sharif  
to adopt a political approach for resolving the Karachi crisis. 
 
Mr Sharif had also referred to his meeting with Mr Hussain and asked the  
government to hold local bodies elections in Sindh, withdraw 'false  
cases' against Mr Hussain and provide general amnesty to the MQM  
workers. "We owe it to the people of Pakistan to rise above narrow,  
partisan considerations and make a fresh beginning with new policies and  
initiatives on the Karachi crisis," Mr Sharif wrote in his letter. 
 
So far the two leaders have exchanged many similar letters but a meeting  
between them has yet to materialise. 
 
Ms Bhutto, replying to Mr Sharif's letter, expressed her gratification  
over the offer of co-operation extended by the opposition leader on the  
issues of national interest. 
 
The Prime Minister, however, politely reminded the opposition leader  
that while on one hand he was offering his co-operation to the  
government, on the other hand he was making plans with the MQM to hold  
protest meetings in the United States during her visit. 
 
"We have received reports that the Nawaz League, in tandem with Altaf  
group of MQM, is seeking to get time on TV Cable News, organise protest  
meetings and deluge US Congress with negative material," she said. 
 
s"While recognising the right of the opposition to protest as it deems  
fit, I wonder if it would not be more befitting, considering the  
national interest, not to do so on US soil," Ms Bhutto said.

<a name="appr">New letter to Benazir : PM's approach painful, says Nawaz 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
Bureau Report 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 4: Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has expressed  
disappointment over Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's reply to his earlier  
letter and said her approach towards Karachi was painful. 
 
"As your letter makes clear, Karachi obviously does not command the  
attention of your government that the grave situation in that city  
warrants," Mr Sharif said in a new letter sent to the Prime Minister on  
Tuesday. 
 
"Your somewhat casual approach to events at home, particularly the  
alarming situation in Karachi, has pained me since it reflects a lack of  
seriousness in tackling vital national issues," the opposition leader  
said, apparently disturbed by Ms Bhutto's reply that she would meet him  
on her return from the United States. 
 
He said Ms Bhutto instead of discussing the Karachi situation in her  
letter focused on her US trip. "This shows the absence of concern or  
commitment towards Karachi." 
 
Mr Sharif criticised the Prime Minister's visit to the United States and  
said the country could ill afford luxuries of such expensive visits,  
particularly when the revenues were fast depleting. 
 
Referring to Ms Bhutto's charge that the PML in collusion with MQM was  
planning to stage protest demonstrations in the US cities on her  
arrival, Mr Sharif said Pakistanis living in foreign countries were  
equally concerned about the dismal state of affairs in their country and  
were free to express their sentiments. 
 
The opposition leader took strong exception to the phrase of "Nawaz  
League" used by the Prime Minister while referring to the opposition  
Pakistan Muslim League in her letter. 
 
"Your reference to the country's largest party, the Pakistan Muslim  
League, as Nawaz Group typifies a mentality devoid of basic etiquettes,  
manners and all norms of decency governing relations between political  
forces in a civilised democratic society," Mr Sharif said. "It is this  
intolerant attitude towards the opposition that lies at the root-cause  
of the crisis in the country." 
 
He hoped that on her return from the United States, Ms Bhutto would find  
some time to pay attention to pressing domestic issues facing the  
nation. He said the government's wrong policies had pushed Karachi to a  
virtual point of no return. "Further callousness and negligence will  
only aggravate matters, deepening the crisis," he said.

<a name="deat">4 held for 31 deaths in city 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
By Ghulam Hasnain 
 
KARACHI, March 31: After a week-long extensive search operation, police  
arrested four activists of Mohajir Qaumi Movement (Haqiqi) and Sipah-i- 
Sahaba Pakistan who had allegedly killed at least 31 people in four  
attacks during the last two months. 
 
Informed sources told Dawn the four were the members of a single gang  
which had carried out most of the killings in the city since December  
last. 
 
The four, who the investigators claimed were operating on the orders of  
the top leadership of Sipah-i-Sahaba and MQM Haqiqi killed four  
brothers, including a police officer, in their New Karachi house on Feb.  
18, gunned down 20 people in attacks on Mehfil-i-Murtaza and Abul Fazil  
Abbas Mosque on Feb. 25 and shot dead seven members of three families in  
the PECHS area on March 2. 
 
Besides, the gang carried out the killings of MQM workers, orders of  
which were allegedly issued by the Haqiqi leadership. 
 
The provincial Secretary-General of Sipah-i-Sahaba, Hafiz Ahmed Bakhsh,  
who has been under detention since March 10 explosion at a Shia mosque  
in Malir, is now being jointly investigated by the personnel of top  
intelligence agencies after disclosures that he was the main SSP leader  
who was giving the killing orders. 
 
Officials hinted that following the arrests of 11 activists allegedly  
involved in the city killings, moves are afoot to arrest the central  
leaders of Sipah-i-Sahaba and Sipah-i-Mohammadi who had ordered the  
killing of their rivals.

<a name="kill">5 involved in city killings named 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
By Ghulam Hasnain 
 
KARACHI, April 2: The names of five activists of Mohajir Qaumi  
Movement (Haqiqi)  and Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan who had allegedly  
killed at least 68 people, including some Sunnis and a Christian, in  
the city since February last, were officially released on Sunday. 
 
They are: Mansoor Babar, Dr Umer Hayat, Mohammad Fazil, Karimullah  
Sharif and Syed Asif Ali. 
 
Officials said the five, who were the members of a team of over two  
dozen hired guns, were taking orders from the central leadership of  
Haqiqi and SSP. 
 
According to sources, record seized by the police and the  
interrogation of the suspects revealed that Haqiqi chief Afaq Ahmed;  
provincial secretary general of SSP, Hafiz Ahmed Bakhsh; its  
information secretary Tariq Madni and other central leaders of both  
the parties not only were aware of the activities of the gang but  
were also allegedly issuing death warrants. 
 
The sources said SSP leader Hafiz Ahmed Bakhsh, who was investigated  
by a top team of intelligence personnel, not only revealed the entire  
network but also helped police find some clues. 
 
But the main problem for the police, the sources said, was that they  
were not yet given permission to arrest Haqiqi leadership and other  
members of his party, for their alleged participation in all these  
killings.

<a name="legh">President flies back today : Leghari, MQM talks end without progress 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
By A Correspondent 
 
KARACHI, March 30: President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari held talks with  
the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) leaders on Thursday in a bid to restore  
peace in the city and urged them to cooperage with the government in  
realising this objective. 
 
"The President urged them (MQM leaders) to join hands with the  
government to restore peace and normalcy in the city which was the basic  
minimum requirement for further talks," said the spokesman for the  
President. 
 
The talks were held at the initiative of the President at the State  
Guest House. 
 
Official circles did point out that President in his meeting with MQM  
leaders underlined the need for co-operation among all sections of the  
people in the city to bring peace. 
 
Highly placed informed sources said that MQM delegation presented a list  
of its grievances to the President. The President is understood to have  
told them that he would require time to go through them before making  
any observation. 
 
Till press time MQM Rabita Committee was still deliberating on the pros  
and cons of the talks.

<a name="germ">Shift in German stand on Kashmir 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
Bureau Report 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 5: German President Roman Herzog, while supporting  
plebiscite for the Kashmiri people, categorically stated on Wednesday  
that the right to self-determination must not be won by "force." 
 
In a major policy departure from last year when German Foreign Minister  
Klaus Kinkel declared the UN resolutions on Kashmir to be "irrelevant",  
the German president, at a Press conference here, told newsmen: "The  
resolutions are still valid, and both Pakistan and India must find new  
solutions to resolve the Kashmir conflict peacefully." However, he was  
quick to point out that Germany retains its "neutrality" on the Kashmir  
conflict between Pakistan and India. 
 
On his first state visit since his assuming office of President, Mr  
Herzog said that during his talks with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and  
President Farooq Leghari, he raised "sensitive" questions on NPT,  
Pakistan India relations, alleged attempt to smuggle fissile material  
into Pakistan from Germany, human rights and the change in a paragraph  
on blasphemy law.

*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi 
 
WASHINGTON, March 31: Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Thursday  
referred to Kashmir as "a long-standing problem" and said there was some  
need for "a resolution or near-resolution" of it. 
 
Answering Congressman James Moran's question about Kashmir and South  
Asia, where "the situation is not getting better," Secretary Christopher  
told the House International Relations Committee the United States had  
been trying "to work constructively with both Pakistan and India" to see  
if they could have some resolution of the conflict. 
 
There was no reference to Kashmir or South Asia in Secretary  
Christopher's prepared statement when he surveyed the world scene while  
defending the State Department's 21.2 billion dollars budget.

<a name="lead">Benazir meets Congress leaders today 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  Mohammad Ali Siddiqi 
 
WASHINGTON, April 5: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto arrived here on  
Wednesday on a nine-day tour that includes a first-ever meeting with  
President Clinton for talks considered crucial to the future of US- 
Pakistan relations. 
 
The Prime Minister reached the US capital a day after President Clinton  
admitted for the first time that the half-a-decade-old sanctions policy  
toward Pakistan had failed and said America should "seriously review"  
its policy toward Islamabad. 
 
The talks with President Clinton are scheduled for April 11. 
 
The visit has been preceded by the extradition to the United States of  
two of Pakistan's most wanted drug barons - Iqbal Baig and Anwar Khattak  
- an issue on which the US has been sensitive. 
 
State Department acting spokesman David Johnson said on Tuesday the  
extradition of the two was "the type of action that we like to see in  
the positive relationship that we're building with the government of  
Pakistan." 
 
The Prime Minister will utilise the period between now and the White  
House event to drum up congressional support for Pakistan for changes in  
if not a repeal, of the Pressler amendment. 
 
Among the congressional leaders the Prime Minister will meet Thursday  
are Senate majority leader Senator Bob Dole, Senator Jesse Helms, the  
Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman who is opposed to all aid,  
Representative Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the House international  
Relations Committee, besides individual senators like Reid and members  
of the House and Senate foreign relations committees. 
 
In the afternoon, the Prime Minister will also meet Senator Hank Brown,  
chairman of the Senate subcommittee on Near East and South Asia. Last  
month, Senator Brown surprised everybody by questioning Administration  
officials on the utility of the Pressler amendment.

<a name="supp">Repeal of Pressler law : Benazir to seek Congress support 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
Bureau Report 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 2: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's forthcoming nine- 
day visit to the United States signals significant developments that  
augur well for the future of Pakistan-US relations, Foreign Secretary  
Najmuddin Shaikh said here on Sunday. 
 
Pakistan must not expect any dramatic results, such as the repeal of  
Pressler law, during Ms Bhutto's interaction with the Americans. The  
Foreign secretary Mr. Najmuddin Shaikh, however, struck a note of  
hope, saying: "We expect Ms Bhutto to establish a rapport with the  
top Congressmen at the Hill and succeed in securing the support of  
the Congress for Pressler's repeal." 
 
While the Clinton administration has already denounced the  
discriminatory law as a "blunt instrument," the test of Ms Bhutto's  
persuasive skills will be her success in convincing the Congressmen  
to review the Law. 
 
"There is already a wave of sympathy vis-a-vis Pakistan's position  
pervading on Capitol Hill, and many voices are being raised against  
the country-specific Pressler Law. Besides, the US now wants a  
peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute and has spoken against the  
current human rights violations and systematic repression of the  
struggle of Kashmiri people by India," Mr Shaikh told a group of  
newsmen, while quoting the US Secretary of State, Mr Warren  
Christopher, and the resolution tabled in the House of  
Representatives on the conflict in Kashmir. 
 
Ms Bhutto is expected to brief Congress heavy weights like Speaker of  
the House Newt Gingrich, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, Chairman of  
the House International Relations Committee Benjamin Gilman, Chairman  
of the Senate Sub-Committee on South Asia Hank Brown, Chairman of the  
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Jesse Helms and a host of other  
important Congressmen like Lee Hamilton. 
 
To a question whether Ms Bhutto was offering any quid pro quo to the  
Congress in lieu of Pressler's repeal, the foreign secretary was  
categorical in stating that there was no question of a shift in  
Pakistan's principled position on the nuclear issue. 
 
Giving a detailed history of bilateral relations since the  
enforcement of Pressler, Najmuddin Shaikh said while Pakistan has  
refused to sign the NPT unilaterally until India did so, "It makes  
good sense for India not to agree to any nuclear proliferation  
measures because it wants a status 'quo in US-Pakistan relations, it  
does not want the restoration of pre 1990 relations." 
 
He said efforts by the US to pressure Pakistan to accept the NPT  
unilaterally failed. Now the American businessmen had blamed Pressler  
for blocking and damaging their business prospects with Pakistan due  
to the denial of insurance by Overseas Private Investment Corporation  
(OPIC) and the Trade Development Assistance Fund which were barred  
under Pressler. 
 
Asked if Ms Bhutto would return "empty handed" from the US, given  
that Pressler would not disappear overnight nor the F-16s delivered  
on a platter, Najmuddin Shaikh said, "We expect to sign some aid  
agreements for the social sector, the money for which will be given  
to the non-governmental organisations under PL 480. But the scale of  
such US assistance will be quite small," he warned, adding that  
Pakistan did not believe in aid, but wanted trade instead.

<a name="prog">PM's visit: progress on key issues unlikely 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi 
 
WASHINGTON, April 4: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto files in here on  
Wednesday on a much awaited nine-day tour to establish what would be the  
first high-level contact between Pakistan and the United States since  
the end of the Cold War. There is an excess of unresolved issues, and  
Pakistan diplomatic sources have been careful not to raise expectations  
as to the outcome of the visit, the second by Ms Bhutto as Prime  
Minister. 
 
The visit has been preceded by what to Prime Minister were some highly  
embarrassing developments that at one stage seemed to cast a shadow on  
talks with her American hosts and appeared even to threaten the visit  
itself. Thanks, however, to skilful diplomacy, and the understanding  
shown by sections of the responsible media and Administration officials,  
the damage has been contained. 
 
In fact, on the killings of the two American consulate employees in  
Karachi and the arrest and extradition of Ramzi Yousef, tables have been  
turned, and the attempt by the Indian lobby to arraign Pakistan has not  
only failed; President Clinton, State Department officials and the media  
have hailed Pakistan's co-operation with the United States in combating  
terrorism. 
 
The First Lady's swing through South Asia also helped matters a great  
deal. Non-political and basically symbolic, the Hillary visit,  
nevertheless, served to focus media attention on Pakistan and on the two  
ladies and helped inject a lightness of touch in what at times appeared  
a grim scenario. 
 
Nevertheless, symbolism matters little when it comes to brass tacks, and  
for that reason no one in the State Department or the embassy here tries  
to underrate the difficulties ahead, given the complexities of the  
issues begging serious tackling and attention for half a decade. 
 
*From  the Pakistani perspective, the challenge lies in crafting a new,  
multifaceted relationship, now that the old bonds revolving round the  
military axis have been buried once and for all. 
 
To the Pakistan side, the issues that merit attention are Indo-Pakistan  
problems (Kashmir, rights abuses in the valley, the missile race), the  
F-16 affair and the Pressler amendment; to the US side, basically two  
issues matter, nuclear proliferation and terrorism. 
 
This is not to say that the Americans are not aware of the many other  
issues on which the two sides tend to draw closer. But so devastating  
has been the impact of the Pressler amendment on their bilateral  
relationship that progress has not been achieved even in areas where  
this was possible. 
 
That is where the truth and the challenge lie: both sides believe a new  
relationship must be developed, and are eager to do so. But progress is  
blocked because neither side knows precisely how to go about it. 
 
The Pakistani formula for breaking the impasse is pedestrian, meant more  
as political rhetoric. It knows that Congress - more so the Senate  
Foreign Relations Committee headed by Senator Jesse Helm - now hates the  
very word "aid." So it believes in strengthening the non-military, non- 
aid side ... trade and investment, to be more specific. But this can  
hardly be a doctrine on which to base foreign policy at a time when  
trade barriers are vanishing throughout the world in any case, and  
almost every Third World country is seeking, and receiving, foreign  
capital. 
 
On the other issues, terrorism and narcotics, the government of Pakistan   
is serious only to the extent Americans are watching. Otherwise, no  
government of Pakistan, whatever its political hue, has the courage or  
the inclination to crack down on the powerful drug mafia or on the even  
more powerful and sacrosanct post Afghanistan fundamentalist militias  
they are waiting in the wings. Nevertheless, the GoP is paying attention  
to these issues to keep the Americans happy. 
 
In one respect, however, the GoP has shown robust common sense, for  
there is one policy constant that overrides all other considerations:  
Islamabad must not only be an the right side of the United States, it  
must appear to be Washington's good friend and provide New Delhi with no  
opportunity to get closer to the world's only superpower at Pakistan's  
expense. 
 
This policy entails, often a one sideness that remains unreciprocated. 
 
The American side is not unaware of the root-cause of the problem, the  
Pressler amendment. As the last few months have shown Administration  
officials, beginning with Defence Secretary Perry, have criticised the  
law and called it counter-productive. The gist of what Perry, Energy  
Secretary  O'Leary, Assistant Secretary Robin Raphel Assistant Defence  
Secretary Joseph Nye and others have said was this: the Pressler  
amendment has failed to dissuade Pakistan from pursuing its nuclear  
programme; America now has no leverage with Islamabad, the amendment is  
punishing US business rather than Pakistan, because the GoP is doing its  
purchases elsewhere. 
 
This, then, is the only hint of the line the American side is thinking  
along for the benefit of a state located in a region where the US has  
vital economic and geopolitical interests. 
 
The one commodity the Gulf and the south-west Asian region lacks is  
goodwill for America. With Afghanistan in debris, Central Asia in  
turmoil, and Iraq and a fundamentalist Iran hostile to the US more than  
ever before, "moderate," democratic Pakistan still retains a certain  
value for the United States. To put it negatively, the US would not be  
the gainer if it loses the only potential friend it has in the area. Not  
for nothing did Perry say after his return from South Asia, "Pakistan is  
the key to peace in the region." 
 
Non-proliferation, undeniably, is one of the major planks of American  
foreign policy. But, as the last five years have shown, it has achieved  
no successes in South Asia. India would not curtail its nuclear  
programme because of its China concerns, while Pakistan would take no  
unilateral steps if India did not follow suit. 
 
The bait the US offered to Pakistan - F-16s for a capping and rollback -  
failed to tempt Islamabad. In fact, over the last couple of years,  
Pakistan has been bold enough to take the veil off its nuclear mystique  
and, instead of repeating the "peaceful purposes" line, now openly  
declares that it views its nuclear plans in the security context. 
 
This, then, is another constant in Pakistan's negotiating strategy. Come  
what may, Pakistan will not give up its nuclear plan - and there is  
nothing the US with the lame duck Pressler amendment, can do about it.    
 
It is against a background of these realities - a mix of wide areas of  
agreement and disagreement, challenges and opportunities - that the  
Benazir visit is taking place. 
 
The State Department official said it would be first meeting between  
President Clinton and Prime Minister Bhutto and affirmed that the US  
side would concentrate on how to improve the relationship. But, he made  
it clear an improvement in the bilateral relationship would be within  
the context of the US desire to improve relations with all states of  
South Asia. 
 
Clearly, it is Congress and not the Administration that holds the trump  
card, for it is the legislature that will decide whether to resume aid  
by repealing or modifying the Pressler amendment. While there is a  
strong pro-Pressler lobby here, Pakistan is not without friends. Last  
month, there have been hints from Congressmen - among them Senator Hank  
Brown, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Sub-Committee on Near  
East and South Asia, and Congressman Lee Hamilton, former chairman of  
the House International Relations Committee, that the Pressler sanctions  
needed changes. 
 
These were the only points' on which the legislators agreed with  
officials. What precise form an amendment to amendment would take, if at  
all, is not clear. 
 
There would be plenty of gestures and symbols, besides the signing of  
memorandums of understanding on American investments in new sectors. But  
a breakthrough on such key issues as the release of the F-16s, a greater  
American commitment to pressure India to improve its human rights  
records, or an active US mediatory role in Kashmir do not appear to be  
on the cards. 
 
In ultimate analysis, the visit would be the end in itself, for it would  
have demonstrated that Pakistan and America were on speaking terms.

<a name="pdf">Mistrust plagues PDF alliance 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
By Mahmood Zaman 
 
LAHORE: Mistrust between the PDF parties continues to plague the  
alliance. Differences have now surfaced between the two over the issue  
of filling as many as 42,000 vacancies in Grades 1 to 16 in Punjab  
government departments. 
 
Most People's Party MPAs want a quota of 70 per cent to be allotted to  
PDF MPAs, with only the remaining vacancies being filled on merit. But  
legislators of the PML (Junejo) are said to be in favour of filling all  
the vacancies on merit. 
 
The vacancies are to be filled by April-15. The date was extended from  
March 31 as a merit policy and procedure had not been evolved and also  
because no decision was taken on the PPP MPAs' demand for a quota.  
 
PPP MPAs believe that if their demand for a quota for all PDF MPAs is  
conceded, it will help the ruling alliance by aiding unemployed youth  
and giving a political boost to the alliance parties. 
 
But PML(J) leaders think that it will be a dangerous game to play. Since  
the number of unemployed educated youth far outstrips the jobs  
available, "we may he doing a disservice rather than a good deal to our  
government if we insisted o a quota for ourselves", one PML(J) activist  
said.

<a name="drug">Drug barons' extradition challenged in SC 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  Nasir Malik 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 4: The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Wednesday  
about the admissibility ) of three petitions filed by the wives of  
alleged drug lords Mirza Iqbal Baig and Anwar Khattak against the Lahore  
High Court decision that cleared the way for their extradition to the  
United States. 
 
The Lahore High Court on Sunday allowed the extradition of seven drug  
barons, including Baig and Khattak. The two were immediately flown to  
the United States in a US military plane. 
 
Though apparently the petitions will make  little difference for Baig  
and Khattak who have already been sent abroad, they can affect the  
remaining five accused who are in Adiala Jail. 
 
One of the five accused, Nasrullah Hanjera has applied to the Supreme  
Court to grant an order blocking his possible extradition. 
 
Khawaja Haris, lawyer for the accused, has maintained in his petitions  
that the extraditions are in isolation of Section 5 (2) of Extradition  
Act 1972 which bars extradition until an accused has been  acquitted or  
completed a sentence in his own country. 
 
Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar told reporters on Monday that the  
alleged drug barons were handed over to the US authorities after  
completing all legal requirements. 
 
But constitutional experts say the government acted in haste by  
immediately parcelling the two accused thus denying them of their  
constitutional right to appeal before the Supreme Court. They also point  
out that the extradition was also contrary to Article 4 of the  
Extradition Agreement signed between the two countries. 
 
Article 4 says: The extradition shall not take place if the person aimed  
has already been tried, discharged or punished or is still under trial  
in the territories of the high contracting party (applied to in this  
case Pakistan) for the crime or offence for which his extradition is  
demanded. If the person claimed would be under examination or under  
punishment his extradition shall be deferred until the conclusion of the  
trial or the full execution of any punishment awarded to him." 
 
Haris told reporters that Baig and Khattak were still serving their  
five-year jail term awarded to them by a Karachi magistrate. Besides,  
two cases were also pending against them.

<a name="extr">2 drug barons extradited to US 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  Nasir Malick 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 2: The government on Sunday extradited two notorious  
drug barons to the United States after Lahore High Court (Rawalpindi  
bench) rejected their petitions against their extradition orders, an  
official said here. 
 
Haji Iqbal Baig and Anwar Khattak were taken to PAF Base, Chaklala  
from  where they were flown to the United States in a US naval  
aircraft, the official who asked not be named said. 
 
"It is clear from the evidence produced by the prosecution in support  
of the allegation that Mirza Mohammmad Iqbal Baig received $250,000  
($2.5 million) for six tonnes of hashish in 1983, $400,00,00 ($4.0  
million) in September 1993 and $120,000,000 ($120 million) through  
his partner Akber Sheikh for 20 tons of hashish," the court order  
said, rejecting the petitions of seven drug barons, including Baig  
and Khattak. 
 
The other five are Tariq Butt, Ghulam Mohammad, Umar Khan Afridi,  
Iqbal Parvez Durrani and Nasrullah Khan Hanjera. 
 
The fate of the remaining drug barons whose applications against  
their extradition were rejected by the court was not known. 
 
Baig, came into limelight during the military rule of Gen Zia-ul-Haq  
when his people beat up a foreign media team which had come to make a  
film on him secretly.    
 
Patronised officially during the martial law period, a hunt for Baig  
who was began after the restoration of democracy in 1985. 
 
He kept in hiding for several years fearing his extradition to the  
United States. Finally he surrendered before the authorities in 1989  
when Ms Bhutto came to power. 
 
Soon after he filed an appeal against his extradition and had been  
challenging the lower court decisions. 
 
This time, he had opposed his extradition on the ground that the  
inquiry conducted by a magistrate suffered serious technical defects. 
 
Nine people have been extradited since the caretaker government of  
Moeen Qureshi in 1993. He was the first to extradite four people  
wanted by the United States on drug smuggling charges. 
 
Those extradited in the past include Zulqarnain Khan, Misal Khan,  
Khalid Khan, Taweez Khan, Shahid Hafeez Khawaja, Mohammad Saleem  
Malik and Mian Mohammad Azmat. 
 
Of these three - Misal Khan, Khalid Khan and Taweez Khan - were  
acquitted by a US court and have since returned to Pakistan. 
 
The remaining have either been awarded long terms of imprisonment or  
are facing trial.

<a name="stay">Drug baron's extradition stayed till 12th 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
Bureau Report 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 5: The Supreme Court on Wednesday provided temporary  
relief to an alleged drug baron, wanted in the United States on a drug  
trafficking charge, by stopping his possible extradition until April 12. 
 
Nasrullah Hanjera had appealed to the Supreme Court against a decision  
of Lahore High Court regarding the extradition of seven drug lords. Two  
of them, Haji Iqbal Baig and Anwar Khattak, were extradited a few hours  
after the court decision. 
 
The wives of Baig and Khattak had also filed petitions in the Supreme  
Court but the three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali  
Shah, did not take up the petitions for technical grounds. 
 
The bench was of the opinion that there was no urgency involved in their  
appeals as the two had already been extradited to the United States.  
Besides, it was also to be seen whether the petitions can be accepted in  
their absence. These petitions would come up on their term in routine. 
 
However, the court accepted the application of Nasrullah Hanjera, one of  
the five drug barons at Adiala Jail, and granted him interim stay order  
until April 12. "Issued notice to the respondents and also to the  
Attorney General for 12.4.95. Till then, the petitioner may not be  
removed from Pakistan," a short court order said. 
 
Hanjera has made Interior Secretary, Superintendent Adiala Jail and  
Magistrate who conducted the preliminary inquiry, respondents in the  
case. 
 
Baig's petition has been filed by Abid Hasan Minto, Khattak's petition  
by Ijaz Batalvi and Butt's petition by Dr Abdul Basit, all  
constitutional experts. The three lawyers have invoked the fundamental  
rights in their petitions. 
 
Baig and Khattak were extradited to New York two days before Prime  
Minister Benazir Bhutto embarked on a visit to the United States.

*From  Abdul Sattar Qamar 
 
.MULTAN, April 4: Jamaat-i-Islami has been divided into two groups and  
Majlis-i-Shoora members opposed to the policies of Qazi Hussain Ahmed  
have decided to convene a convention on April 14 and 15 in Lahore under  
the leadership of Maulana Naeem Siddiqui, a close associate of the late  
Maulana Maudoodi. 
 
Sources in the group told Dawn here on Tuesday that the breakaway 
faction would be called Tehrik-i-Islami. 
 
He claimed that 16 members of Majili-i-Shoora, provincial Nazima Amira  
Ehsan, divisional Nazima Rawalpindi Talat-Habib, Nayyar Bano, Ummi- 
Zubair, Bilqees Soofi, Qamar Jalil, and Yasmin Hameed had decided to  
quit the Jamaat and join the Tehrik accusing Qazi Hussain violating the  
party programme. 
 
The Tehrik sources said a manifesto and constitution of new party had  
already been finalised and a large number of workers would take part in  
the convention from all over the country. Maulana Gauhar Rehman would  
take part in the convention with a large group of workers from the NWFP. 
 
However, Mian Tufail Mohammad and Professor Ghafoor Ahmed are reluctant  
to join hands with the dissidents, but they did not oppose the formation  
of new party. 
 
Meanwhile, Jamaat-i-lslami sources told Dawn that a number of  
delegations were visiting the different cities to contact the dissident,  
and convince them against joining the tehrik. If they refused to stop  
opposing Qazi Hussain Ahmed, their membership would be terminated. They  
said disciplinary action had been taken against six members for plotting  
against the party. Those expelled are Mukhtar Salim, Hafeez-ur-Rehman  
Ahsan, Nasar Ahmed Zahid and Abdus Salam Khan from Lahore, Ch Abdul- 
Rehman from Islamabad and Hakim Mehmood Saharanpuri from Rawalpindi. 
 
The Jamaat sources further said all those attending the Tehrik  
convention would lose their JI membership.

<a name="reco">Recovery on the horizon 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
SIGNS of recovery were visible on the Karachi Stock Exchange last week  
thanks to active short-covering by both the institutional traders and  
the leading brokerage houses but analysts doubted the market's ability  
to sustain any technical rally until and unless it was backed by peace  
in the city. 
 
Doubts are still lurking in investors' mind about the duration of that  
the current pause in the city killing to entertain the idea that peace  
has returned to the hostage city. 
 
However, some recent positive developments on the political front,  
notably the initiatives taken by the President to talk to the warring  
groups have raised hopes and a major breakthrough might be imminent,  
with peace not being distant possibility. 
 
The Karachi Stock exchange index of share prices after several weeks  
persistent decline finally managed to stage a good recovery, up 41.65  
points at 1,655.26 as compared to 1,613.61 a week earlier, reflecting  
the relative strength of the base shares. 
 
State Bank's quick monetary steps including uncapping of lend rates and  
two per cent increase in bank credit ceiling could be some of the  
financial positive development. 
 
Although new buying is still to re-emerge even on the relative safe  
havens, technically short dealers and brokers were active on selected  
counters and made covering purchases at the lower levels. 
 
"The market derived its main strength from active buying in the bank  
shares after the news of removal of lending rate cap but there were some  
other aiding factors too," said and analyst. 
 
Most analysts believer the current political initiatives taken by the  
Opposition leaders despite rigid official stance could attain the  
cherished goal of peace in the city. 
 
"The sentiment in part is also boosted by the clarification by the army  
that it did not oppose talks with the MQM for peace in the city as it  
has a role to play," they added. 
 
However, most analysts doubted the market's ability to sustain the rally  
on the strength of the bank shares. 
 
Volume soared to a new peak level of about 24 million shares, surpassing  
its previous all-time record of 23.3 million shares some days back, bulk  
of which, more than 15 million shares, went to the credit of PTC. 
 
Floor brokers doubted the market's ability to extend the current rally  
as heavy foreign selling in PTC shares could take its toll. 
 
They said a record single session volume of 15 million shares in any  
listed share is unprecedented and amounts to panic selling. 
 
Bulk of the activity, therefore, was confined to about half a dozen  
current favourites, as investors were not inclined to move out of the  
safe havens until the market stabilises on certain viable levels. 
 
Floor brokers were, thus divided over the direction of the market with  
the start of the new account, although most agreed that selling pressure  
could dominate the trading scene in the sessions to come. 
 
Even some of the bank shares which the led the market advance could not  
sustain the overnight gains as some leading among them ran into selling  
and ended partially reacted. 
 
The market advance was led by the bank sector where prices recovered in  
unison on strong covering purchases at the attractive lower level,  
leading gainers among them being Citicorp, MCB Bank of Punjab, Soneri  
Union Fidelity and Askari bank. 
 
They were followed by most of the cement, and synthetics shares under  
the lead of Mustehkam Cement, which rose by Rs 10 followed by Cherat  
Cement and Bengal Fibre and Ibrahim Fibre in the Synthetics. 
 
Energy shares did not follow the market's general line of action and  
fell further under the lead of PSO, Shell Pakistan, but Sui Southern and  
some others rose appreciably. 
 
Among the auto shares, Pak Suzuki Motors, and Balochistan Wheels rose  
modestly but Al-Ghazi Tractors, and some others fell. 
 
Most of the MNCs played on both sides of the market amid brisk rolling  
of positions from the high-risk areas to the relative safe haven. 
 
While Philips, Fauji Fertiliser and ICI Pakistan showed good gains  
ranging from Rs 2 to 8, Siemens, and Parke-Davis fell sharply on selling  
at the higher levels.

<a name="88bn">Rs 88bn power plan for Karachi 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  I.H. Rashid 
 
LAHORE, April 5: The Karachi Electric Supply Corporation (KESC) has  
drawn up an ambitious Rs 88 billion power development plan for Karachi. 
 
The plan, which forms part of the Prime Minister's Karachi package, was  
discussed here by KESC chairman and managing director S.T.H. Naqvi with  
WAPDA during a recent visit to Lahore. It provides for investment of Rs  
83 billion in the private sector and Rs 5 billion in the public sector. 
 
According to the plan the KESC's present installed capacity of four  
power stations is 1738 mW while its firm capacity is 1500 mW which is  
equal to the present requirement of the city. During summer and in  
emergencies, the KESC buys power from WAPDA, Pakistan Steel and the  
Karachi power plant. With its annual load growth rate up to 8 per cent,  
Karachi's actual power need will go up to 2200 mw by the year 2000. 
 
The KESC has plans to purchase about 2500 mw power from the private  
sector which is setting up thermal power stations in the vicinity of the  
city. The new power plants are expected to start production by the end  
of 1997. In addition, the KESC is adding a sixth unit at its Bin Qasim  
power station at an estimated cost of Rs 5 billion. The unit which will  
produce 210 MW will start operating in July next year. Transmission  
lines of 220 kv capacity are being laid at an estimated cost of Rs 4.5  
billion. The Korangi thermal power station will be renovated and a 300  
mW unit would be added. 
 
Letters of support have been issued by the private power Cell, ministry  
of water and power, to the Fauji Electric Power Company for setting up a  
350-mW power project at Hub, to Wakgas for setting up an 800-mw barge- 
mounted diesel power station at Bin Qasim, half of which will be  
connected to the KESC grid, and to Messrs Gul Ahmad for setting up a 125  
mW diesel power plant in the Korangi industrial area. 
 
According to the KESC chief, work on the fifth power project has been  
launched for expansion and rehabilitation of Karachi's old and  
inadequate power transmission and distribution system. The work, which  
is estimated to cost $245 million, is expected to be completed by the  
middle of next year with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank,  
the Export and Import Bank of Japan and the World Bank. 
 
With the completion of the programme, the KESC's transmission capacity  
will increase to about 900 mVA.

is expected to be signed in a day or so. 
 
Official sources told Dawn here on Saturday that Gordon Wu has finally  
agreed to use the indigenously produced coal at Thar for its proposed  
thermal power plant at Keti Bandar in Thatta District. 
 
"With the Hong Kong-based business tycoon agreeing to invest six billion  
dollars, the government has succeeded in arranging 4500 mw of power  
needed for the country," said an high official of the Ministry of Water  
and Power. 
 
Ministry of Water and Power, Private Power and Infrastructure  
Board(PPIB) and Sindh Coal Development had been engaged in negotiations  
with a three-member team of Consolidated Electric Power of Asia (CEPA)  
for the last one week. 
 
The government had offered to CEPA that it may start its power plant on  
the imported coal but then it should be switched over to local coal as  
and when coal extraction started from Thar. The CEPA delegation was not  
ready to accept the proposal. But now CEPA has agreed and plans to set  
up four power plant of which one at Keti Bandar. 
 
The issue of site selection was another impediment which had also  
been resolved in the negotiation concluded here on Thursday.

<a name="psto">PS to buy Chinese technology 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  Ihtashamul Haque 
 
ISLAMABAD, March 31: Finding it difficult to raise Rs 70 billion  
required for the proposed expansion of Pakistan Steel Mills, the  
Ministry of Industries and Production has suddenly decided to go for the  
Chinese technology against the time tested Russian steel technology,  
Dawn learnt here on Friday. 
 
The expansion programme has already created a stir in the higher  
quarters with many officials of the Ministry of Industries and  
Production opposing the deal that has just been struck with China during  
Minister Brig (Retd) Asghar's visit to Beijing. 
 
According to the programme, the expansion plan envisaged increasing  
production from 1.5 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes annually. Rs 37  
billion were estimated for the programme in August 1993 which has now  
surprisingly increased to Rs 70 billion. 
 
The expansion programme, which was earlier discussed with the former  
USSR and then with the Russian Federation, has been stopped, and a  
decision was taken all of a sudden to approach the Chinese for the  
purpose. "How could we support the obsolete Chinese technology for the  
expansion of Steel Mills, knowing that it is inferior and cannot do good  
to the organisation," an official said, who vehemently opposed the  
Minister's decision to go for the Chinese technology.

<a name="ptc">3 companies shortlisted in PTC sell-off 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  Ihtasham ul Haque 
 
ISLAMABAD, April 2: The Privatisation Commission has shortlisted  
three international companies, to finally select a Financial Adviser  
for privatising 26 per cent strategic shares of the billions of  
dollars Pakistan Tele-communication Corporation (PTC). The  
shortlisting of three companies were made out of nine companies which  
were earlier shortlisted out of total of 26 companies of the  
international repute. 
 
"Now one company to act as a financial adviser will be selected  
through bids to facilitate the early privatisation of the PTC,  
chairman of the Privatisation Commission Syed Naveed Qamar told Dawn  
here on Sunday. 
 
He said the formal announcement for the selection of these three  
companies would be made in a day or so. The three international  
companies shortlisted are: Morgen Stanley (USA), Goldman Sachs(USA)  
and Morgen Grenfell (UK). 
 
It is expected that within this month the PTC will be converted into  
a Pakistan Tele-communication Corporation Limited (PTCL). This will  
be followed by the registration of the organisation as public holding  
company in June and the entire process of selling 26 per cent  
strategic shares will be completed by December. 
 
The Privatisation Commission expects to get 2.5 billion dollars to 3  
billion dollars from the sale of 26 per cent shares. It has already  
received about Rs 30 billion on account of about 9.8 per cent of the  
total share capital of the proposed company.

<a name="lawd">Proposed law disturbs many 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
By Izharul Hasan Burney 
 
KARACHI: Government's decision to make law for the disqualification of  
legislators defaulting in payment of bank loans and credits, utility and  
service bills, and taxes, duties, levies and charges for more than three  
months has left many parliamentarians high and dry and anxious inquiries  
are being made on the scope and implications of the move. 
 
Querries have been referred to constitutional experts and lawyers  
specialising in financial matters as the promised details of the  
proposed law are awaited. 
 
Knowledgeable sources however feel that if the aim is to launch the  
"moral crusade" from where law-making takes place, it will have to be a  
well diagnosed prescription that leaves no loopholes unplugged. 
 
The need for removing lecunae in the existing laws has been felt all  
along and this newspaper, for one, has pinpointed some of these since  
the first move by the caretaker government of Mr Moeen Qureshi on the  
eve of Election-93. 
 
The first ordinance on the subject came on August 19, 1993. It inter- 
alia provided that candidates for general election shall file  
declaration to the effect that no bank loan or credit was outstanding  
against him or in the name of his spouse or dependent (parents or  
children) for more than one year, and (ii) that no such loan or credit  
had been written off. 
 
As part of this exercise, the nomination papers determined the amount of  
unpaid for loans at Rs one million in both cases, and the cut off point  
was set as the partyless elections of 1985. 
 
The addition of arrears of the unpaid for bills of the utility and  
service agencies was on the eve of the Senate elections which took place  
in March 1994, and the period of default was six months "of an amount as  
may be prescribed." 
 
On the eve of the filing of the nomination papers, Pakistan Banking  
Council released voluminous lists of bank defaulters. Certain nomination  
papers were rejected, while many others were withdrawn. 
 
But PBC lists were neither complete nor flawless, and several leading  
politicians went to courts which upheld their plea. They contested, won  
and are now members of the assemblies. 
 
FIRST LESSON: The first lesson of the maiden exercise was that even the  
DFIs were not infallible. Experience also showed that not all the  
returning officers got the PBC lists and it was left to the objectors to  
raise the issue and prove the point. A third was that neither the  
objectors nor the ROs had time to pool information to challenge the  
nomination papers. 
 
During the course of the election process, another ordinance was  
promulgated requiring the successful candidates to file a return of  
their assets and liabilities and those of their spouse and dependents  
(parents and children). The winners did it; their election was duly  
notified by the Election Commission to pave way for taking oath as MNA  
or MPAs. 
 
The lecunae in this particular matter was, and is to this day, that no  
proforma was prescribed for such a declaration. Instead, the winners  
were asked to write it on a piece of plain paper and deliver it to the  
Election Commission. 
 
The other flaw was that the Election Commission was neither empowered to  
examine nor scrutinise the return. The document was placed securely in  
the vault and the keys remain in the custody of the Chief Election  
Commissioner. 
 
On an application of Malik Mohammad Qasim, Chairman of the Federal Anti- 
Corruption Committee, the Election Commission delivered a detailed  
judgement on the confidentiality of this document, restricting its  
availability only to the contestants from the constituency to which the  
winning legislator belonged. It is not a public document. 
 
LECUNAE LISTED: To sum up, the lacunas in the law may be listed as  
under: 
(a) Unreliability of bank loans and credits with particular reference to  
the period of default; 
(b) Absence of clarification to the effect that the default covered  
repayment of loan instalments rather than the full amount which the  
borrower may have obtained; 
(c) Non-fixation of the amount of arrears of over six months bills of  
the utility and service agencies; 
(d) Immunity from disqualification clauses once a person takes oath as  
legislator, and until he seeks a fresh election; In the case of returns  
of assets and liabilities, the lecunae could be summarised as under: 
(a) Non-prescription of any proforma for the filing of the returns; 
(b) Debarring the Election Commission or any other authority to study,  
examine or scrutinise the returns or hold inquiry or investigations as  
to their' correctness or otherwise; 
(c) Confidentiality of the returns except in the case of rival  
candidates; 
(d) No requirement of follow-up returns in each completed year of tenure  
as legislator. 
 
GOVT MEASURES: Announcing the decision of the Federal Cabinet on March  
27 last, Information Secretary Hussain Haqqani, inter-alia listed the  
following measures "to end the culture that has developed in Pakistan  
that influential people do not pay their bank loans or taxes because of  
their political influence" 
 
(i) Yearly returns of assets and liabilities to the Chief Election  
Commissioner at the end of June; 
(ii) Scrutiny of the returns by the CEC and follow-up action, if  
necessary; 
(iii) Three months grace period to legislators to clear the arrears of  
loans, taxes, utility and service bills etc; 
(iv) Returns to be filed both by winners and losers of Election-93; and  
(v) Procedure for disqualification to be prescribed. 
 
 Relevant circles assume that the proposed law would also plug the  
remaining holes to cover matters such as- 
 
(1) Proforma for filing returns of assets and liabilities (Election  
Commission had proposed one on the eve of Election-93. Another option is  
to adopt the Income Tax form for Wealth Tax returns, and yet another is  
the form devised by the authorities during the martial law). 
(2) Declaring the returns as a public document and its availability to  
any citizen of Pakistan on demand (as is the case with any other court  
document), instead of treating it as a highly classified document; 
(3) Empowering the Election Commission to scrutinise the return through  
a firm of chartered accountant or any government agency like the Auditor  
General of Pakistan. 
(4) Citizens right to question the correctness of the return at any time  
during the tenure of the legislators, instead of only 45 days prescribed  
for filing of appeal by a rival candidate before the Election Tribunal;  
(5) Arrangements in each bank, co-operatives, DFls etc to keep an  
uptodate record (on monthly basis) on an all-Pakistan basis so that,  
like the Electoral Rolls, the list of defaulters is made available  
promptly in the event of a by-election or snap elections. 
 
PROBLEM AREA: The most problematic area, however, will be the host of  
public sector organisations and utility and service agencies which would  
need to upgrade their accounting procedures for a correct and uptodate  
record of arrears of taxes, levies and duties on the one hand and the  
bills of electricity, gas, telephone etc on the other. 
 
These taxes are collected by federal agencies like Income Tax, Customs.  
Provincial governments collect the taxes like irrigation water, land  
revenue, Zakat and Ushr, land rent and host of other items. Local bodies  
taxes relate to water supply, sewerage, fire tax, general tax, property  
tax etc. 
 
Barring major agencies like Customs, Income Tax etc, accounts elsewhere  
are in a pathetic state. It is poorer still in the provincial  
government, and in a worst shape in the local bodies. 
 
Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation is improving; gas distribution  
companies are in good shape; but WAPDA and KESC remain far from public  
expectations. 
 
In the given situation, one wonders how the government expects honest  
enforcement of the disqualification law. 
 
Any slip or default on the part of the banks or the tax collecting  
agencies would of course be rectified when disqualification proceedings  
start, but by that time it would have already caused all kinds of  
misgivings including vendetta and political victimisation and will  
grossly undermine the credibility of the government.

No.... of 1994. Syed Masroor Ahsan, petitioner versus Mr Ardeshir  
Cowasjee and Others, Respondents. Registered Notice... Please take  
notice that I have today filed petition under Article 204 of the  
Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 before the Supreme  
Court of Pakistan at Islamabad on behalf of the petitioner, in the above  
cited case. [signed by] Raja Abdul Ghafoor, Advocate on Record, Supreme  
Court of Pakistan, Islamabad, for the peititioner, 4-12-94." 
 
Prayer clause of this Petition: "Under the circumstances, it is  
therefore prayed that the respondents may kindly be punished for  
committing the contempt of this Court so that such irresponsible  
tendency is curbed in future." 
 
March 22: The 6 p.m. English news and 9 p.m. Khabarnama broadcast by the  
government controlled television, told viewers that contempt proceedings  
had been initiated against me, and the editor, printer and publisher of  
Dawn. Heard from the Dawn offices that a Press Note had been received by  
fax, issued by the Registrar of the Supreme Court: 
 
"Islamabad March 22- In the contempt petition filed by Syed Masroor  
Ahsan a Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan comprising Mr Justice  
Manzoor Hussain Sial, Mr Justice Muhammad Munir Khan, and Mr Justice Mir  
Hazar Khan Khoso has initiated contempt proceedings against Mr Ardeshir  
Cowasjee, Ahmad Ali Khan, Editor, and Mr Ghulam Ali Mirza, Publisher,  
daily 'Dawn', Karachi directing them to appear on 9.4.95 before the  
Court and answer the charge....." 
 
March 23, March 25, March 27: News items regarding contempt proceedings  
published in the Press. 
 
March 29: Notice issued by the Assistant Registrar of the Supreme Court  
at Karachi to Raja Abdul Ghafoor, AOR, to me, to Ahmad Ali Khan and to

Cowasjee, respondent, under the caption of "Defection Case" published in  
daily "Dawn" dated 25.11.1994, edited and published by Ahmad Ali Khan  
and Ghulam Ali A. Mirza, respondents respectively, it appears to us that  
there is sufficient ground for believing that the respondents have  
committed the contempt of court and it is necessary in the interest of  
effective administration of justice to proceed against them. The  
substance of the charge against them is that they, by writing and  
publishing the aforesaid article which tends to bring the authority of  
this Court into disrespect and disrepute, scandalises Judges in relation  
of their office and disturbs the decorum of the Court, have, prima- 
facie, committed offence punishable under Section 4 of the Contempt of  
Court Act read with Article 204 of the Constitution of the Islamic  
Republic of Pakistan 1973. 
 
"Let notice to issue directing the aforementioned respondents to appear  
before the Court on 9.4.1995 and answer the charge." 
 
"Take further notice that the above noted case is now fixed for hearing  
before the Court on 9.4.95 at 9.00 a.m. or soon thereafter as may be  
convenient to the Court in the Court House at Islamabad. 
 
"Islamabad 27.3.1995. "C.A. (Fixture)". 
 
Article 204 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,  
1973: 
 
"(1) In this Article, "Court" means the Supreme Court or a High Court. 
 
"(2) A Court shall have power to punish any person who" 
 
(a) abuses, interferes with or obstructs the process of the Court in any  
way or disobeys any order of the Court; 
 
"(b) scandalises the Court or otherwise does anything which tends to  
bring the Court or a Judge of the Court into hatred, ridicule or  
contempt; 
 
"(c) does anything which tends to prejudice the determination of a  
matter pending before the Court: 
 
"(d) does any other thing which, by law, constitutes contempt of the  
Court. 
 
"(3) The exercise of the power conferred on a Court by this Article may  
be regulated by law, and subject to law, by rules made by the Court." 
 
Section 4 of the Contempt of Court Act: 
 
"Punishment: Whoever commits contempt of Court or abets the commission  
of contempt of Court may be punished with simple imprisonment for a term  
which may extend to six months or with a fine which may extend to five  
thousand rupees or with both. 
 
"Provided that, on being satisfied that the accused, whether after  
defending himself or without offering any defence, has purged himself of  
the contempt of Court, the Court may discharge the accused or remit this  
sentence." 
 
March 31: My column headed 'Freedom of the Press' was considered by  
Dawn's editor to be inappropriate for publication that day and was not  
printed.

<a name="synd">Front-line state syndrome 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
By M.B. Naqvi 
 
PRIME MINISTER Benazir Bhutto's Washington visit, beginning on April  
5, has suddenly become extraordinarily controversial. 
 
In an interview to American media, she has visualised a new  
relationship between America and Pakistan based on American  
recognition of this country as a front-line state in the fight  
against Islamic fundamentalism and related causes. 
 
She is clearly aiming at American aid the way it was available during  
the 1980's for the Islamic Jihad against communism in Afghanistan.  
Americans are being urged to help her government as a matter of duty  
in the holy war against 'terrorism, militancy, extremism,  
fundamentalism and narcotics trade', in Pakistan - that are the  
fallout from the Afghan war (for which presumably the Americans bear  
some responsibility). 
 
There is no doubt that Pakistan is in a difficult and confusing  
situation. No one can doubt the importance of having good working  
relationship with America, the only superpower with overwhelming  
presence around us. These ties should be based on adequate  
understanding of each other's position, interests and purposes; areas  
of convergences - and consequent cooperation - should be as clearly  
spelled out just as those of divergences should be mapped out for  
agreeing to differ. That requires their working together with honesty  
to extend areas of convergence on the basis of equality and mutual  
goodwill. But it does not require the kind of helpless beseeching for  
aid that the Prime Minister has reduced herself to. 
 
She may have gravely damaged the cause she implicitly is espousing:  
human rights, democracy and modernism by asking the Americans for aid  
in fighting religious extremism and related evils in the domestic  
sphere. The force described as Islamic fundamentalism that takes  
extremist shapes, including sectarianism, is basically a home-grown  
thing, though the Afghan war may have exacerbated it. But the primary  
responsibility for dealing with it is Pakistan's own. It is not,  
fundamentally, for foreigners to fight the implications or  
consequences of religious fanaticism in a Muslim society. Calling it  
a fallout of Afghan war is only partially true. Americans only  
exploited existing sentiments and illusions and no more; they  
certainly did not create the passion that gives birth to holy  
warriors of any kind. 
 
Americans paid good money to the basically mercenary fighters, both  
of whom had their own axes to grind, not to mention Islamabad's own.  
Both were satisfied with each other at the time. By asking for  
American aid PM Bhutto would make fundamentalists the only champion  
of anti-imperialist sentiment and that would politically strengthen  
them no end. Clarity of thought is the primary need in order to  
establish a mutually beneficial relationship with the only superpower  
there is. That, however, ought not to compromise Pakistani state's  
sovereign equality despite its being relatively small and weak. 
 
Conduct of the present government has already compromised Pakistan's  
sovereignty by concedings privileges to official American agencies  
that are reminiscent of the "capitulations" granted by Ottoman Empire  
to, or "extra-territorial rights" that were imposed by, European  
colonial powers on India and China among others. Examples are  
multiplying: The way fugitives from American justice have been  
rounded up and hustled out of the country without so much as a token  
presence before a Pakistani court is a tell-tale; the way FBI is  
'exclusively' investigating and interrogating suspects and witnesses  
in the murder of two American nationals in Karachi in which local  
police has not the slightest say is the latest example. 
 
Then, Ambassador John Monjo has propounded a doctrine that needs to  
be rejected about the American law being enforceable on Pakistani  
soil by American law enforcement agencies (such as has already begun  
to happen). This is a theory that implicitly assumes America,  
American law and Americans to be somehow superior to all; American  
interests override those of others. The Pakistan government has to  
clarify its position on this subject, unless, of course, we are happy  
to become and remain a vassal state. 
 
It is saddening to watch the misconceived pleadings by the Prime  
Minister about Pakistan emerging as a 'front-line state' against  
terrorism and in the vanguard of the 'movement to uncover militant  
groups that have been operating in different Muslim countries'. Her  
message to the Americans sounds pathetic: "One of the messages I will  
be taking to the US (is) that you are a fair nation, we have been  
allies, so help me strengthen the forces of moderation within  
Pakistan by taking away the factor that fuelled fanaticism". 
 
What it comes to is Islamabad's endeavour to join the glittering  
fraternity of King Hasan of Morocco, present regimes in Algeria and  
Tunisia, President Hosni Mobarak of Egypt and other moderates Gulf  
Shaikhs and Amirs. What these regimes can get away within their  
countries would scarcely be possible in Pakistan. Pakistan is not  
like any other country of West Asia. Islamabad may think it is the  
only feasible way of seeking American military or military-related  
economic aid. It is cold war thinking: it is the syndrome of front- 
line states being bolstered to remain in the front-line against a  
common enemy. 
 
We had better be realistic and look at the Pakistan-American ties  
from  other angles. Some one should exercise his mind to visualise how  
American administration would view its ties with Pakistan in the  
light of its own priorities and purposes. Then, there might be a  
second exercise of looking at Pakistan's own long-term and immediate  
interests, without forgetting elementary truths such as preserving  
its own freedom of action. 
 
It is possible to sympathise with the predicament of the PPP  
government. But this can only be up to a point. It may have no option  
but to carry on a Kashmir policy that displeases Americans, Indians  
and some others and maintaining a nuclear stance that fails to  
satisfy the Americans and the West. The endeavour to please the  
Americans in other spheres - fighting religious extremist groups and  
their narcotics-loving friars - may be understandable but is fraught  
with bigger dangers than joining the anti Soviet Islamic Jihad in  
Afghanistan was. 
 
Islamabad's predicament lies in having, an over-sized military  
establishment, with commitments in Kashmir and Afghanistan that are  
beyond the financial capacity of the economy. But few outsiders can  
sympathise with this: not even all Pakistan is agree with the need to  
obtain American aid on no matter what terms or bases. Invoking the  
'front-line state' syndrome is possibly the most dangerous line of  
least resistance that will land the country in God knows what  
troubles and where. 
 
This is not to say that those in Pakistan who see religious  
fanaticism and all its works to be destructive, not only of human  
freedoms of Pakistanis but also of Pakistan. State in a primary  
sense. They do need to galvanise themselves for a supreme effort  
against it. But religious bigotry cannot be fought with armies and  
para-military forces, even if its by-products might require to be  
tackled physically. But the latter is not the main war. Primary  
theatre of this war is the human mind; and knowledge, scientific mode  
of thinking and spirit of relaxed tolerance - born of the values of  
freedom and human equality - constitute the ammunition. Maybe the  
Americans will help in this all-important war by suitable means.  
Maybe they won't. Let us leave it to them. 
 
Who can forget that Pakistan is the main intellectual centre of all  
kinds of Islamic revivalist ideas. The Islamic Ideology that was  
propounded by Jamaat-i-Islami here has had a big impact on the rest  
of the Islamic world and has in fact furthered the work of Akhwanul  
Muslimeen in the Arab world. This has had, however, its own  
vicissitudes and now Islamic Ideology faces its own come uppance in  
the shape of a multiplicity of religious orthodoxies staking out  
their own exclusivist claims on the allegiance of the faithful. This  
proliferation of internally-quarrelling Islamic extremist movements  
may be dangerous to others as well. But it is primarily a danger to  
our own state and society: it is basically our business. 
 
If there are outsiders who sympathise with those Pakistanis who are  
countering religious fundamentalist movements, let them come and ask  
what help they can render. Their help should be tailored to the task  
in hand. It is primarily a political and theoretical task and not one  
of finance or military strength or even better policing, though they  
might be important for other purposes. Tackling Islamic extremism  
does not entitle Islamabad to a flow of dollars that would only  
fatten the elite groups. 
 
The Americans and others know their own minds, they are unlikely to  
be impressed by clever talking points. Let Islamabad worry over the  
issues that keep South Asia divided and at war with itself. Local  
solutions, rather than alliance-seeking with the US (under whatever  
nomenclature) should be our quest. If we can do that, ties with  
America can be expected to change in a radical fashion.

<a name="anpp">ANP-PML allegations say nothing new 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  A.S. Yousufi 
 
PESHAWAR: True to the age-old habit of Pakistan politicians the  
defeated candidates of the ANP and PML and local leaders of the two  
parties have refused to accept the people's verdict in the two by- 
elections on PF-63 and PF-70 and have called upon the Election  
Commission to withhold the results and order recounting of the votes. 
 
The charges levelled against the government party and its candidates  
are just usual. They said nothing new when they claimed at their  
Press conferences that the results were manipulated during counting  
and that bogus votes were cast in large numbers. There was no third  
argument which they could advance. 
 
In one of the Press conferences addressed by the ANP-PML office- 
bearers Farid Toofan and Haji Mohammad Javed, both former ministers  
and both holding responsible offices of provincial general secretary  
of their respective parties as well as the two defeated candidates  
made some irresponsible statements which not only tarnish the image  
of the country's judiciary but also of the government the provincial  
administration and the Election Commission. Such sweeping remarks  
should have been avoided for the sake of parties credibility. How  
easily they forgot the results of the earlier two by-elections in  
Kohat and Nowshera in which the ANP candidates defeated those of the  
PPP was amusing. At that time the elections for them were transparent  
and the results correct; and it was so because the opposition ANP had  
emerged victorious. 
 
It goes to the credit of the PPP that despite losing the by-elections  
of Kohat and Nowshera its leadership did not indulge in invectives  
and accusations and accepted the results though it had lost the  
Nowshera seat which it had captured in the election. 
 
At the Press conferences on Saturday the two general secretaries and  
their defeated candidates from Buner and Swat justified their claim  
that results were manipulated during counting on the ground that  
announcement of results was delayed till about 2 am because in  
earlier countings the opposition candidates had an edge over the  
PPP's. The argument does not hold good because results of both the  
constituencies had landed in newspaper offices in Peshawar by 10.30  
pm and correspondents of national dailies had filed their reports  
latest by 11.15 pm after due verification from various sources. 
 
As regards the charge of bogus voting this too does not stand to  
reason. To avoid ghost votes and to maintain complete peace during  
polling the local administration in Buner and Swat had taken some  
very effective precautionary measures. All the roads to Buner had  
been blocked by law-enforcers and even journalists from outside Buner  
found it impossible to cross any of the barriers. There were no  
skirmishes at the polling stations and no hot words were exchanged  
between the candidates or their supporters. Both at Buner and in Swat  
the ANP and PML along with the PPP had posted hundreds of their  
workers some of whom had been brought from outside the constituency  
before the blockade was enforced on the morning of March 30. 
 
The agents of the candidates were present at the counting counters in  
Buner and Swat. None of them raised any objection and everything went  
on smoothly till the following day the ANP and PML had second  
thoughts and changed their posture. To put the record straight  
leaders of both the parties had accepted defeat on the evening of the  
polling day. So at least they told the newsmen who rang them up on  
the evening of March 30. 
 
The most unfortunate aspect of the negative approach of the  
opposition leadership is that even a straightforward Begum Nasim Wali  
Khan who is party leader in the Provincial Assembly could be  
influenced to express her doubts about the polling results suspecting  
manipulation in counting. 
 
Another unfortunate aspect is that at the Press conference the ANP's  
Toofan was for the first time joined in by the PML's Haji Javed when  
both of them passed defamatory remarks against the judiciary. While  
Mr Toofan has been in the habit of maligning the judiciary for his  
own good reasons he found another person in PML's Haji Javed to the  
his line. At the Press conference both reportedly ruled out moving  
the courts in this regard as they were of the view that they did not  
expect justice from such courts where jialas were appointed as  
judges."

<a name="solv">Leghari's effort to solve Karachi issue 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  M. Ziauddin 
 
ISLAMABAD: On the last Thursday of March in the morning President Farooq  
Ahmed Khan  Leghari resumed, on behalf of the government, the on-again  
and off-again negotiations with the MQM in Karachi while in the evening  
on the same day, Prime Minister Ms Benazir Bhutto addressing the nation  
over TV and radio reiterated her resolve to punish terrorists and wipe  
out terrorism from the country. 
 
The seeming contrast in the approach of the two towards the Karachi  
problem, however, is said to be part of a single policy with two-tracks  
which it is learnt was approved on March 27 at a meeting of the  
President, the Prime Minister and the Chief of the Army Staff General  
Abdul Waheed-the troika. 
 
With the unfolding of this two-track policy, things are expected now to  
move rapidly on the Karachi front. While keeping the pressure on the  
terrorists, possibilities are likely to he probed to make arrangements  
under which the MQM would be allowed, say within the next 90 days, to  
test their representative character at the local level and also join the  
provincial government. 
 
But all this is easier said than done. Look at the predicament of PML  
which has recently developed an understanding with the MQM. A stormy  
scene ensued as soon as the Central Working Committee of the party was  
informed of the decision to ask National Assembly members from urban  
Sindh to resign to enable MQM to return to the political mainstream  
through by-elections. 
 
The Karachi MNAs of the PML were afraid that the move would wipe out the  
Party from Pakistan's largest city, while the CWC members from the  
interior of the  province were certain that such a step would adversely  
affect the growing popularity of the party in rural Sindh. And Nawaz  
Sharif who does not draw his political clout from Sindh as much as the  
prime minister does, had had to postpone a decision on the matter. 
 
Nawaz has the support of Punjabi settlers in the province. With the help  
of the MQM, he can in any future elections give Ms Bhutto a run for her  
money in her home province. But still, he would fall short of the  
numbers needed to make a government in the province if he fails to take  
rural Sindh with him. So the last minute dithering by Nawaz on the issue  
of translating the understanding reached with the MQM into a political  
reality. 
 
By contrast the political price Ms Bhutto will have to pay in rural  
Sindh for accomodating the MQM at the local and provincial levels would  
be much more devastating for her. Sindhis live in the perpetual fear of  
being turned into Red Indians by the never ending migration into urban  
part of the province from not only up country but also from India,  
Bangladesh, Burma, Iran, Afghanistan and many such places. Sindhis have  
also come to believe that if they concede political dominance of Karachi  
to the MQM today, tomorrow the ethnic organisation would stake its claim  
over the entire province. The MQM has not done anything so far to  
assuage the dread of Sindhis. In fact, their irresponsible members have  
done everything to reinforce these fears by loose talk of turning  
Karachi into a Hong Kong and demanding the holding of census under the  
UN. 
 
Therefore it is almost certain that the nationalist Sindhis would make a  
successful bid to oust Ms Bhutto from her base the minute she is  
perceived to be making some concessions to the MQM. 
 
So, the troika probably thought that the President rather than the prime  
minister was better placed politically to talk the MQM back into the  
country's mainstream politics while getting, in return ,the MQM to allay  
the fears of Sindhis by publicly renouncing the drivel of dividing the  
province on ethnic lines and the gibberish of getting urban Sindh to  
secede from Pakistan. 
 
The office of the President does not empower Mr Leghari to play a role  
in this particular matter. But he can perhaps without seeming to be  
interfering in the provincial matters, help turn the administrative  
Babel there into a single authoritative voice to be obeyed by all the  
agencies and departments now working at cross purposes and coming in  
each other's way. 
 
While the political track is to be followed by the President, the prime  
minister probably has been given a totally free hand by the troika to  
pursue the criminal track and deal sternly with the terrorists and  
terrorism. It was, therefore, necessary that while the President was  
trying his hand at healing the political wounds, the terrorists, lest  
they get the wrong signal, were told at the same time in unambiguous  
terms that they cannot hide behind their political affiliations any  
longer. And it was also necessary perhaps to clear off the distracting  
impression that the army had given Nawaz Sharif some kind of assignment  
vis-a-vis the MQM. The prime minister's address to the nation took care  
of these two things effectively.

<a name="beyo">Beyond exchanging letters 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
 
IF the letters that Ms Benazir Bhutto and Mian Nawaz Sharif have written  
to each other are even published, it will be an anthology unlikely to  
set the oceans on fire. Petty point-scoring and empty rhetoric are the  
most outstanding characteristics of these literary exchanges. Do their  
latest letters regarding the situation in Karachi contain the promise of  
anything different? Mian Nawaz Sharif, it will be remembered, wrote to  
the Prime Minister after returning from London where he had held talks  
with the MQM chief, Mr Altaf Hussain, offering to cooperage with the  
government in finding a solution to the problems of Karachi. In his  
letter he had suggested that the government should withdraw all 'false'  
cases against Mr Altaf Hussain, announce an amnesty for his colleagues  
and facilitate the MQM leader's early return to the country. In her  
reply the Prime Minister, without committing herself to anything  
specific, has welcomed Mian Nawaz Sharif's offer of co-operation and  
said that she would like to meet him at a mutually convenient time on  
her return from the United States. What Mr Nawaz Sharif makes of this  
reply remains to be seen. If past experience is any guide, he could well  
lament the fact that Ms Bhutto has said nothing about the specific  
points he had raised. It would be unfortunate, however, if he were to  
make this an excuse for ridiculing or rejecting Ms Bhutto's offer of  
talks. Regardless of whether the Prime Minister and the principal  
opposition leader are capable of behaving in a statesmanlike manner, it  
is imperative that they should meet and talk about important national  
issues. Mr Sharif must, therefore, give a positive response to the Prime  
Minister's letter. 
 
To expect that both would be able to agree on a common set of proposals  
for Karachi, or on a common approach to the MQM, would under the  
circumstances be too much to expect. Their widely differing perceptions,  
as much as their mutual animosity, preclude such a possibility. Even so,  
the mere fact that they get together, if only to be photographed smiling  
at each other, will be a positive development. It can also hopefully set  
a precedent for the future. The tendency of throwing bricks at each  
other and adopting a confrontationist stance on every matter has harmed  
the political system and also brought both leaders into public  
disrepute. It is high time this tendency was checked and new standards  
of political behaviour established. Regardless of the agenda, therefore,  
a meeting between the Prime Minister and the opposition leader is called  
for. Who knows after they have shed some of the loathing that they bear  
for each other they might go on to tackle substantive issues. 
 
But it is the situation in Karachi which forms the backdrop to the  
current exchange of letters and since this also happens to be the most  
important issue confronting the nation, it is on this that their  
attention must be focused. Their public positions on this issue are  
widely divergent, with Ms Bhutto, as in her recent speech, vowing to  
give no quarter to criminal elements and Mr Nawaz Sharif advocating a  
policy of conciliation with the MQM leadership. But it is not too far- 
fetched to visualise common ground emerging between them if Ms Bhutto  
could be persuaded to temper some of her rigidity and Mr Nawaz Sharif  
persuaded to tone down some of the demands he has made on behalf of the  
MQM. It is clear that the MQM must be brought back into the political  
mainstream and its victimisation brought to an end. At the same time,  
there is the question of the criminal cases against Mr Altaf Hussain and  
his followers not all of which are a figment of the government's  
imagination. What is to be done about them? Mr Nawaz Sharif should have  
a realistic answer to this question as well. In any event, the important  
thing is for them to meet. Once that happens other things can follow.

<a name="pakc">Pressure on Pakistan captain 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
*From  Special Representative 
 
SHARJAH, April 5: If the pressure on him was not so obviously known to  
the world, one could never have guessed it from Moin Khan's manner. The  
new captain of Pakistan, only 23, is unafraid to smile, and does not  
mind answering prickly queries either. 
 
"My understanding is that this team has been chosen purely on form and I  
see no reason to think otherwise," he said, looking relaxed in his hotel  
room this morning, when he could have actually been fretting and fuming. 
 
Only the previous night, star all-rounder Wasim Akram had threatened to  
pull out of the tour, and before that Pakistan have lost the services of  
Salim Malik, Ijaz Ahmed Sr, Basit Ali and Rashid Latif. Most young  
players would have forsaken the captaincy to preserve sanity. But Moin  
looks and talks tough.    
 
"He will certainly come," he said of Akram, "it's only a minor  
misunderstanding which will be resolved." By the end of the day, Moin  
had been proved right. 
 
On the other issues, Moin was circumspect, but not silent. "I don't know  
whether Malik and a few others were not selected for any reason apart  
from  cricketing form. If they shape up well, they can make a comeback." 
 
Moin, who had been out of favour for a couple of years, also sees this  
appointment as a chance to redeem his career. " If the selectors see me  
as a stop-gap captain, it is their prerogative. I know that if I perform  
well, then I am here to stay." 
 
He has, of course, a challenging task ahead of him. Pakistan have  
never come here under so much pressure. He leads a side shorn of some  
key players, and also obviously in turmoil. "But that's the way this  
game is played," he states bravely, "Pressure adds to the thrill and  
satisfaction. I am convinced that Pakistan will win this Asia Cup."  
Most critics are not. Moin Khan's biggest challenge yet begins on  
Friday.

<a name="wasi">A welcome gesture by Wasim 
-------------------------------------------------------------------  
By Our Sports Reporter 
 
KARACHI, April 5: The Pakistan Cricket Board, under its active Chief  
Executive known for his diplomatic skills, finally resolved the Wasim  
Akram dilemma. 
 
Wasim Akram, had earlier decided to opt out of the Asia Cup after the  
PCB informed him that he would not be allowed to share his hotel room  
with his wife, although she could otherwise accompany the team. Wasim  
had consequently dropped out of the team and hence had not left with the  
Pakistani squad. 
 
It was early Wednesday morning that Mr Arif Ali Abbasi, was able to  
convince Wasim Akram, the Pakistani speedster, of the need to reverse  
his decision in the interest of the country and the team. Pakistan has  
to be a forceful side, especially in bowling, if at all it has to at  
through the batting line-up of rich-rivals, India, in their match on  
Friday. 
 
Wasim, a former captain of the national squad, had to accede to the  
request of the board after further talks with Mr Abbasi in Karachi. 
 
He flew on to the Gulf sheikhdom on Wednesday to rejoin the team on  
what was the last day for submitting the names of the squad to the  
management of the Asia Cup.
