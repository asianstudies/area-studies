------------------------------------------------------------------- 

*From Muhammad Ali Siddiqi

LOS ANGELES, April 14: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said here on 
Thursday she had not come to the United States with a beggar's bowl, nor 
had she come with something to give. By that she meant Pakistan had not 
compromised on its nuclear plan. In fact, during her talks with 
President Clinton and American officials she had made it clear there 
would be no capping, rollback or unilateral verification.

Addressing members of the Pakistan community, she said: "We came with 
ideas and principles, and explained our position forcefully to the 
American side," and the result was that President Clinton had publicly 
declared that it was morally wrong to hold back both Pakistan's money 
and the equipment. This was, she said, a vindication of Pakistan's 
position on the Pressler amendment.

President Clinton, she said, had not only acknowledged Pakistan's 
principled position on the issue, he had publicly pledged to go to 
Congress to seek amendments to the Pressler law.

As for the memoranda of understanding worth 20 billion dollars signed 
with foreign investors, the Prime Minister said even in a highly 
developed country it took 14 months for a project to mature. But in 
Pakistan four big projects had matured in 12 months' time, which was a 
record.

*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi

LOS ANGELES, April 13: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Wednesday 
applauded "the current effort in Congress" to make changes in the 
Pressler amendment in a way that would make it "less discriminatory" and 
enable America to honour its "contractual obligations."

In a speech largely, though not entirely, devoted to foreign policy, the 
Prime Minister told the Los Angeles World Affairs Council (WAC) while 
she would very much like to see the sanctions lifted, she wanted the 
release of the equipment "that sits in Arizona." Because of our 
strategic situation, she said "our air force needs defensive aircraft."

Quoting Defence Secretary William Perry and Assistant Secretary Robin 
Raphel on the Pressler amendment, the Prime Minister said if the United 
States could not fulfil its contractual obligations," we expect our 
money back.

"Once we are beyond this impasse in our relationship", she said, "we 
hope that the United States would then work with us, as we develop a 
long-term programme a long-term plan, to promote around the world the 
values and concerns that we share."

These values, she said, were "democracy, human rights and human dignity, 
constitutional law, anti-terrorism, anti-international drug trafficking, 
and free market economics, decentralisation and privatisation.

"Answering a question about Pakistan's nuclear programme, Prime Minister 
Bhutto said Pakistanis were "security conscious" because of the 1971 
trauma and the three wars with India. Pakistan's nuclear programme, she 
said, was peaceful but was "a deterrent to India" because New Delhi had 
detonated a nuclear device. Pakistan, thus, had to take every step to 
ensure its territorial integrity and sovereignty.

On-Kashmir, she said the United States had offered to mediate, and 
Pakistan had accepted the offer, while India had not. She hoped Indian 
Prime Minister Rao's answer would be as "positive" as hers.

<a name="nptm"><b>Pakistan to attend NPT moot</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 15: Pakistan will be represented by its Permanent 
Representative to the UN Ambassador, Ahmad Kamal, at the NPT Review and 
Extension Conference starting in New York on April 17 as an observer, 
but is expected to play a significant role in guiding the deliberations 
on non-proliferation and disarmament in South Asia in the absence of 
India, who has refused to participate in the 25-day moot billed as the 
"most crucial conference in recent history."

"There will be a lot at stake for Pakistan during the conference," Munir 
Akram, till recently additional secretary, disarmament and currently 
Pakistan's UN Permanent Representative at Geneva told Dawn on Saturday 
on phone.

He said it would be interesting to see how Egypt and the Middle East 
succeed in securing a commitment from the conference to bring Israel, a 
nuclear threshold state but not a signatory to the NPT, to the "level of 
parity" with Egypt and the Arab states. "The outcome of these 
deliberations will have a direct implication on the other two nuclear 
threshold states India and Pakistan," he said.

Israel like Pakistan will be attending the NPT Review Conference as an 
observer. It may be mentioned that Egyptian President Mubarik, in his 
meeting with President Clinton recently discussed regional proliferation 
and elimination of all weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East 
and wanted the Middle East free of nuclear arms. Prime Minister Benazir 
Bhutto, in her April 11 meeting with Bill Clinton at the White House 
also explained Pakistan's principled position and said Islamabad would 
not sign the NPT unilaterally until India did so.

<a name="lits"><b>US policy on Pakistan makes little sense: paper</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, April 14: The present US policy towards Pakistan makes very 
little sense, Washington's daily The Washington Times said on Friday 
urging the Clinton Administration to "level the playing field" between 
India and Pakistan.

Commenting editorially on the Benazir Bhutto visit, the paper, generally 
considered to be sympathetic to Pakistan, said the United States was 
once again committing the error of rewarding " our armies and punishing 
our friends.

"In the end," the paper said, "there was not much President Clinton 
could offer Benazir Bhutto at the Rose Garden ceremony on Tuesday... All 
Mr Clinton could offer was that, yes, he would do the best he could to 
press Congress for the lifting of the Pressler Amendment."

Mr Clinton also said he would lobby for the release of the F-16 jets or 
at least the return of the money Pakistan had already paid. But, the 
paper said, "executive promises, specially these days, are not much when 
Congress holds the legislative keys. And Congress in this case appears 
unpersuaded by Ms Bhutto's appeals. Not surprisingly, Pakistan's main 
Opposition party lost no time in taunting the Prime Minister for her 
failure.

"All of which is too bad. In this case, President Clinton is on the 
right side of the issue. In Congress, on the other hand, our 
relationship with an important ally, a loyal friend throughout the Cold 
War and the war in Afghanistan and one of the countries that can surely 
play a major role for stability and progress in South Asia, is being 
held hostage by single-issue, non nuclear proliferation advocates."

The paper compared the Pakistan situation with the US policy towards 
India and North Korea and said India had conducted its first nuclear 
test 20 years back, it not only had nuclear weapons but was also 
developing ballistic missiles but, it was not the subject of any US 
targeted sanctions.

"Or look at North Korea whose highly focused quest for nuclear 
technology is now being rewarded with American oil and South Korean 
nuclear light-water reactors. Meanwhile we are not only denying Pakistan 
trade but we are refusing to return their money."

The paper said nuclear proliferation was never a subject to be lightly 
addressed, but there was no reason to think that a nuclear- capable 
Pakistan would be an international threat. "What Pakistan is seeking is 
a balance with its vast and powerful neighbour, India. Rather than 
punish Pakistan, better the US take an active role in mediating in the 
festering conflict over Kashmir."

Controversial Senator Larry Pressler says Pakistan has at least five 
nuclear weapons, claiming that the CIA had briefed him before the 
Benazir Bhutto visit.

"I attended a CIA briefing before she came that convinced me that 
Pakistan's nuclear programme goes beyond simply having the nuclear 
capability Pakistan already acknowledges," Mr Pressler told the 
Washington Times on Thursday.

Pakistan had about five weapons ready to go and India had between five 
and 10, Mr Pressler said.

He challenged Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's denials that Pakistan had 
not assembled a weapon as yet and urged President Clinton and other 
members of Congress to "stand firmly behind the goal of nuclear non-
proliferation."

The Washington Times, however, quoted a recent study by the Asia Society 
titled "Preventing Nuclear Proliferation in South Asia which concluded 
that "there is no evidence of deployed nuclear weapons or plans for 
their deployment."

Leonard Specter, a close watcher of global nuclear developments, serving 
in the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace was quoted as saying 
on Thursday it was believed by most experts that Pakistan could put 
together a bomb within hours and several bombs in about a week.

"A situation in which they can do this but have not done so would enable 
Benazir Bhutto to claim they have not deployed while Pressler says they 
have the bomb," Mr Specter said.

Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had argued with President Clinton last 
Tuesday that Pakistan had the knowledge to make the bomb but because it 
believed in non-proliferation, Islamabad had not gone ahead with making 
the bomb or exporting its technology.

Pakistan should thus be recognised as a responsible international player 
working for non-proliferation, she had argued.

Senator Pressler, however, defended his legislation saying: "There is a 
price for a nation's decision to go nuclear. Mr Clinton must realise 
that there is a greater global price for not upholding the only 
effective piece of nuclear non-proliferation law on the books."

He said the message sent to countries such as Iraq, North Korea and 
other rogue states by the Clinton Administration, as it continues to 
attempt to make an exception to US law, is dangerous and potentially 
destabilising.

<a name="equi"><b>US to send back equipment</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Anjum Niaz

ISLAMABAD, April 16: In an unprecedented signal, since Pressler 
amendment debarred US military transactions with Pakistan, the United 
States government has decided to return the five-year defence hardware 
sent across from here to the US for repairs and has agreed to renew the 
Professional Military Education agreement on reciprocal basis, official 
sources said here on Sunday.

The change of heart came when Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto visited the 
Pentagon during her US visit and met with US Defence Secretary William 
Perry, who calling the Pressler law a "blunt instrument," gave full 
assurances to the visiting prime minister that Pakistan would be 
returned the defence equipment which was sent to the US for repairs but 
got stuck in the bargain when Pressler struck.

The sources said that all the equipment belonging to the Pakistan army, 
air force and the navy would now be returned.

It may be mentioned that Cobra helicopters and some naval and military 
heavy guns had been transported to the US for repairs and Pakistan had 
ordered vital spare parts for its F-16's which never returned from the 
US due to the embargo from Pressler. "The equipment is not that much," 
conceded the sources, calling it a "small time affair", but "it is the 
gesture in the right direction which matters," they added.

Similarly, Pakistan officers who received training at U S military 
institutions would once again be eligible to go: "The US was demanding 
hefty fees from Pakistan for this service since it had been banned under 
Pressler amendment, but now they have allowed the practice to start on 
reciprocal basis once again," said sources.

A compromise such as the above has been put into motion by the US, as 
predicted by Congressman Lee Hamilton who proposed that the US waive the 
storage fees amounting to 50,000 dollars annually for the F-16's, allow 
the Overseas Private Investment Corporation Insurance to start 
operating, permit visa enforcement training for Pakistani customs 
officials and the training of air traffic controllers and offer limited 
economic assistance for social programme.

<a name="lawr">US convinced on Pressler law review
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 17: Foreign minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali said here 
on Monday that while Pakistan had successfully convinced the United 
States on revising Pressler law, it was now up to the White House to 
"assess" when the Clinton administration would like to go to the 
Congress to seek a waiver for the 28 F-16s Islamabad has already paid 
for.

"We have made a major breakthrough in the five-year-old impasse, where 
for the first time a president of the United States and his 
administration have come out boldly and openly against keeping our F-16s 
and our money," Sardar Assef told newsmen.

The foreign minister ruled out Pakistan's plan to take the matter  of 
the held-up 28 fighter planes to a court of law: "why should we go to 
court now that the US has accepted our position and promised to solve 
the problem," he told a questioner. While Islamabad awaited the 
resolution of the Pressler issue, he said both the countries had in the 
meanwhile succeeded in forging an important relationship on a multitrack 
basis exploring several other avenues like economic cooperation:

<a name="f16s"><b>Law in US house for supply of F-16s</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Muhammad Ali Siddiqi

WASHINGTON, April 19: Congressman Dan Burton has introduced a law in the 
House of Representatives to enable Pakistan to take possession of the 28 
F-16s Pakistan has paid for.

Introducing the Bill, the Republican Congressman from Indiana called for 
changes in the Pressler amendment and pleaded for a more balanced US 
policy toward South Asia, especially on the nuclear question.

Said Congressman Burton, "India, which is believed to have a much more 
extensive nuclear weapons programme, continues to receive extensive 
foreign assistance from the United States."

A member of the House International Relations Committee, Congressman 
Burton said, "The US has vital national security and economic interests 
in South Asia."

He added, "Pakistan has been a strong ally of ours in that region for 
years. The Pressler amendment has dangerously undermined that 
relationship. By cutting off Pakistan, we may be driving that country 
into the arms of unpredictable strategic partners like China or Iran.

"The Pressler amendment has not been effective in discouraging 
Pakistan's nuclear programme. In fact, it has probably done just the 
opposite by reducing our influence with the Pakistani government. As 
long as India pursues its nuclear weapons programme Pakistan will feel 
overwhelming pressure to match it. We must pursue a regional programme 
of nuclear nonproliferation that prods all nations in that region to 
move to eliminate nuclear weapons in unison.

"The Pressler Amendment must be reformed or repealed if we are going to 
make progress toward peace and stability in South Asia. We can take a 
first step by allowing Pakistan to take possession of the 28 F-16s for 
which it has paid."

<a name="usin"><b>Benazir takes initiative to attract US investment</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Our Staff Correspondent

LOS ANGELES, April 13: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Wednesday 
launched a major initiative to attract American investment to Pakistan 
by announcing the establishment of a Private Software Export Board 
(PSEB) under the aegis of her government.

The move, she said, would "facilitate the creation and promotion of the 
software development and export industry" in Pakistan.

One of the PSEB's aims would be to "embark on a crash programme" to set 
up Software Technology Parks (STP) in Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore.

Under the scheme, the Board will provide a single-window mechanism for 
the approval of all plans and exempt software developers and exporters 
*from  corporate income-tax for the first six years. The PSEB will also 
permit software exporters to re-export capital goods without any levies.

The Soft Technology Parks (STP) will set up and manage all 
infrastructural resources such as data communications facilities - high 
speed digital data communications links, connecting software developers 
and exporters with their customers overseas and core computer 
facilities.

It will also promote development of export software and software 
services through technology assessment and market intelligence, help 
train software development professionals and encourage the use of the 
state of the art design and development methods and tools.

With "macro-economic stability," deregulation, liberalisation and 
privatisation well under way, the Prime Minister said Pakistan was an 
"ideal place for investors seeking a solid return on investment."

<a name="area"><b>Investment by US : Areas of interest identified</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 17: Pakistan government has identified 12 major sectors 
of the economy for US investment and has received highly favourable 
response from both the Clinton administration and the potential 
investors.

"The United States is fast becoming the largest investor in Pakistan and 
for us it is important, not only to get the capital but also the 
technology," secretary, Board of Investment (BOI) Syed Muhibullah Shah 
told Dawn here on Monday.

Mr Shah, who has also visited the United States with Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto, said Pakistan government has offered these areas where 
huge US investment could be made. These areas, he said, were mainly 
energy, power, infrastructure, industry, roads, agriculture, food, 
chemicals and hotels.

"The government is keen to introduce Pakistan as a multi-sectoral 
economy and has succeeded in convincing the investors, especially the US 
that we have a very good and profitable business environment," Syed 
Muhibullah said.

He said the American investors had been told that they with 100 per cent 
equity start their businesses in Pakistan. "We are quite confident to 
continue attracting the US investors for which a decision had been taken 
up to establish regular contacts between the two governments and the 
investors," the BOI secretary added.

To a question, he said Pakistan was not a single sector economy and that 
there were many other sectors where the US investors could invest.

<a name="talk"><b>Nawaz rules out talks with govt</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Athar Ali

LONDON, April 13: Leader of the opposition Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif 
has ruled out any chance of a dialogue with the government in the 
present circumstances. He said the right kind of atmosphere had to be 
created before such a dialogue could take place. He accused the 
government of continuing with vindictive policies which, he said, were 
hardly conducive to lessening confrontational politics in the country 
that was proving to be very damaging. He also urged the Prime Minister 
to adopt a more positive attitude towards the Mohajir Qaumi Movement 
instead of declaring the party "terrorist" and condemning the whole 
community.

The Muslim League leader is in London to be with his father, Mian 
Mohammad Sharif, who was rushed to London for emergency heart treatment. 
He was discharged from hospital on Wednesday but will stay here until he 
has fully recovered.

Mr Sharif, who met MQM leader Altaf Hussain on Tuesday, said the 
coordinating committees appointed by the Muslim League and the MQM, to 
monitor the working of the understanding reached between the two leaders 
in context of the prevailing situation in Karachi,

He criticised the attitude of the government and said it did not befit 
the Prime Minister to call the MQM a 'terrorist" organisation. "She 
should adopt a more positive attitude." As for his party, he said, it 
would continue its efforts to bring the Sindhis and the Urdu speaking 
people nearer to each other.

Mr Sharif said the Mohajirs had made tremendous sacrifices for the 
creation of Pakistan and it was not right to condemn a whole community. 
This, in his view, would further aggravate the situation and, as a 
result, the whole country would suffer. He said he believed in consensus 
politics and a policy of give and take. He followed this in his time 
when he had reached a number of accords with the provinces, resulting in 
healthy cooperation between them in the political and economic spheres.

LONDON, April 17: Leader of the Opposition Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif

arrive in Islamabad on Tuesday morning. Mian Nawaz Sharif was 
accompanied by his wife. He was seen off at Gatwick airport by his 
brother, Shahbaz Sharif, other members of the family and several office-
bearers of the UK Muslim League.

Mr Sharif arrived here on April 6 along with his father, Mian Mohammad 
Sharif, who was in need of urgent treatment. He has since had 
angioplasty and is now recuperating after his treatment at a London 
hospital. He is expected to stay here for some more weeks.

During his stay in London Mr Sharif had two meetings with the Mohajir 
Qaumi Movement leader Altaf Hussain. The last meeting on Sunday was 
three hours long and was also attended by Mr Shahbaz Sharif, leader of 
the opposition in the Punjab Assembly.

*From  Athar Ali

LONDON, April 16: The leaders of the Mohajir Qaumi Movement and the 
Muslim League had another meeting on Sunday morning to discuss the 
current political situation in the country and to study how they can 
further enhance cooperation between their respective parties.

Informed sources said that Mr Hussain gave his point of view. He 
regretted that the government was continuing with its "oppressive and 
vindictive policies" against its opponents, especially the MQM.

Mr Hussain complained of official indifference towards the whole 
situation and blamed the government for patronising the rival Haqiqi 
group.

Mr Sharif, sources said, agreed that the government was showing total 
indifference towards the situation in Karachi while the MQM and its 
supporters were being made targets for its victimisation. He pointed out 
that he had written two letters to the Prime Minister but found that her 
response has not been satisfactory.

Mr Sharif is said to have assured the MQM leader that now that Prime 
Minister Ms Benazir Bhutto has returned from her US visit he would renew 
his demands and mobilise public opinion in order to put pressure on the 
government so that steps are taken to improve the situation in Karachi 
and Hyderabad.

Mr Hussain during the meeting urged for unity among opposition leaders 
to face the challenges posed by, what he termed as, the government's 
tendency to move towards a "one-party state".

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 17: Supreme Court on Monday gave two more months to 
Attorney General of Pakistan to file a reply in the petition of Mohajir 
Qaumi Movement (MQM) against the Federation of Pakistan and Provincial 
Government of Sindh.

The Court fixed June 6, 1995, as the next date of hearing, acceding to 
the request of the Attorney General who had prayed for grant of at least 
a period of two months for filing reply of the federation and the 
government of Sindh.

He informed the court that two people had been working in Karachi and 
two in Islamabad to draft the Government's response in the case. The 
petition was filed by MQM on January 17, 1995.

Dr Farooq Hassan, who appeared before the court on behalf of the 
petitioner, Senator Ishtiaq Azhar, said that the court in its order of 
January 17, 1995, had observed that matter should be taken up for 
hearing in a period of two months on mutually agreeable date.

Mr Hassan said that after expiry of two months period a letter was sent 
to Attorney General reminding him of the order of the court. He said 
there was no response from the Attorney General to the letter after 
which another letter was written to the Registrar of the Supreme Court   
describing the situation and requested for the fixation of the case even 
if the Government did not file its response.

On an inquiry from the Chief Justice why there was urgency in this 
matter, the petitioner's counsel said that the MQM was an important 
political party. He said respondents had restricted functioning of MQM, 
which had resulted in violation of several fundamental rights of the 
petitioner specially under Article 17 of the Constitution.

The MQM petition which was spread over hundred of pages had also 
contained the details of atrocities and genocide committed by the 
respondents making it liable before the law of the land and 
international laws as well. The petition has evoked international 
interest and Harvard Law School has included the petition as course 
material in the human rights courses.

By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 17: Ten people were killed and six others wounded in an 
upsurge in violence in the city on Monday, raising the current month's 
death toll to 57.

At least eight people died in North Nazimabad alone when unidentified 
men, equipped with AK-47 rifles, surrounded a group of people sitting 
outside a shop and sprayed them with bullets. The MQM (Haqiqi) said four 
of them, Asim Salim, Sajjad, Iqrar and Salim, were its workers.

Thirteen Haqiqi workers had been killed on March 12, when unidentified 
armed men had attacked the party's Pak Colony office. Haqiqi leaders had 
accused the MQM of killing of their party workers.

Narcotics Affairs, John A. Parker, on Tuesday said there were more than 
25 suspected drug barons on the wanted list of the US authorities for 
drug smuggling and other heinous crimes such as homicide.

<a name="mnag"><b>PPP MNA granted 2-day bail</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 18: The Lahore High Court admitted PPP MNA Munawwar 
Hussain Manj to interim bail for two days in the sum of Rs 20 million in 
two drugs trafficking cases "by way of an exceptional relief " on 
Tuesday.

The accused shall, meanwhile, join the investigation, Mr Justice Arif 
Iqbal Hussain Bhatti ordered, and asked the investigating agency - the 
Pakistan Narcotics Control Board - to inform him if he fails to do so. 
Mr Manj was immediately asked by an officer of the PNCB's anti-narcotics 
force, a colonel, to visit the Board's police station in Model Town, 
Lahore, which has registered the main case against him.

Mr Manj has been booked together with his gunman and driver in a case at 
the PNCB police station, Model Town, Lahore, under section 3 and 4 of 
the Prohibition (Enforcement of Hadd) Order, 1979, and section 9 of the 
Control of Narcotic Substances Ordinance, 1995. In another case, the 
three have been booked by the Saddar Police Station, Sheikhupura, under 
Sections 324, 353, 186, 427,279 and 332 of the PPC and section 13 of the 
Arms Ordinance, 1965. The complaint in both cases was lodged by field 
investigation officer Ikramullah.

According to the prosecution, the MNA's car, bearing his number plate, 
was on its way to Sheikhupura when it was chased by anti narcotics force 
on a tip-off. When it took a U-turn towards Lahore to dodge the PNCB 
party, it was given a hot chase and intercepted. An exchange of fire 
took place, in which a shot, fired by the MNA's gunman, a constable 
provided to the MNA for his personal protection injured a couple of PNCB 
men. The gunman was overpowered and search of the car yielded 35 kg of 
heroin and 30 kg of charas in as many bags. Rifles and ammunition were 
also seized from the vehicle. The incident occurred on April 14 last.

Barrister Khosa said the MNA had nothing to do with the car. The car 
belonged to its driver, Siddique, a notorious trafficker, against whom 
the had lodged a complaint with the PNCB. His gunman, constable Abdul 
Sattar, MNA was in league with Siddique, who had named him (Mr Manj) as 
co-accused to exculpate himself from the charge and win his acquittal.

Mr Manj, Mr Khosa said, was a member of the National Assembly's 
Narcotics Control Committee, of which Chaudhary Akhtar Ali Waryio of the 
PML(J) was the chairman. In that capacity, he time and again complained 
against 'the inaction and collusion' on PNCB officers and officials. He 
had also spoken to Federal Interior Minister Naseerullah Khan Babar, and 
high ranking army officers in this regard.

Mr Khosa said the prosecution story in sofar as it involved Mr Manj was 
conjectural. The FIR should have been confined to the incident. The 
statement of the co-accused, who has tried to absolve himself of any 
wrong doing, was inadmissible in evidence and could not serve as the 
basis of prosecution.

Contesting the bail plea, Mr Pasha said the alleged offences were 
punishable with death or life term and that the MNA had no case even for 
a bail-after-arrest what to speak of a bail-before-arrest. All the 
district and sessions judges had been designated special courts for 
trying trafficking cases under the Control of Narcotics Substances 
Ordinance, 1995, and he could approach them for bail. If he was really 
innocent, he should not fight shy of joining investigation. The plea of 
mala fides was completely untenable as Mr Manj was an MNA of the ruling 
party, Mr Pasha said.

He disclosed that Mr Manj was involved in 17 criminal cases though his 
personal custody was required for investigation of the two trafficking 
cases.

So far as the confessional statement of co-accused Siddique was 
concerned, Mr Pasha said, he had substantially implicated himself in the 
offence. Siddique had said he was the MNA's partner in drug trafficking 
to the extent of 25 per cent, he added.

<a name="anti"><b>4 held in UK, Pakistan anti-drugs campaign</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Athar Ali

LONDON, April 19: In a joint operation, authorities in Pakistan and 
Britain have foiled an attempt to import the chemical used in making 
heroin. After raids in London, the police arrested two British nationals 
of Pakistani origin who are in their late twenties. The man will be 
charged on Thursday.

Two more persons were arrested in Pakistan: one in Islamabad and the 
other in Lahore. They are British nationals.   The arrests followed 
raids in several places in Britain and Pakistan. The operation - 
Albatros - which lasted five months, involved officers monitoring the 
UK-based targets and the movement of the chemical.

According to the police, it had been earlier decided that there should 
be no restriction on the chemical's shipment from the UK to Pakistan's, 
so that not only the British operators could be arrested but also their 
counterparts.

Officers from the South East Regional Crime Squad, in London, travelled 
out to Pakistan and established contacts with the anti-narcotics force 
there. The British drugs liaison team, based in Pakistan, also 
cooperated in the operation and assisted in the monitoring of the 
movement of the chemical.

The chemical drums were seized  in Lahore and export documents 
confiscated both in Pakistan and the UK. The UK police had received 
information that a team of professional drugs traffickers, with strong 
links to Pakistan, had fraudulently purchased one tonne of Acetic 
Anhydride, the chemical needed to transform opium into heroin.

The chemical itself, a police spokesman told Dawn, was an expensive 
commodity in Pakistan. While it cost  1,000 per tonne in the UK, in 
Pakistan it was sold at 70,000 per tonne, he said and added that a tonne 
of the chemical was sufficient to make three tonnes of heroin from 
opium.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 17: A highpowered delegation headed by Prime Minister's 
Advisor on Finance and Economic Affairs V. A. Jafarey will leave Karachi 
for Paris on Tuesday to attend the Aid to Pakistan Consortium meeting 
and to seek 2.2 billion dollars for 1995-96.

Official sources told Dawn here on Monday that a pre-Consortium meeting 
that was held in Islamabad by the envoys of Paris club recently had 
endorsed Pakistan's request for 2.2 billion dollars for the next 
financial year.

Sources said that this time the main emphasis would be on increasing 
disbursement ratio.

Moreover, this time, sources said, Pakistan would seek enhanced 
financial assistance for Social Action Programme (SAP) for which a 
separate document has been prepared for the consideration of the 
Consortium meeting. Pakistan, it is said, will ask the Paris Club to 
provide additional funds for the SAP so that highly neglected social 
indicators could be improved. Sources said that a separate assistance of 
300 to 500 million dollars will be sought for SAP.

Based on current estimates Pakistan expects total official commitments 
of 2.6 billion dollars for 1995-96, including 2.2 billion dollars from 
the consortium, 278 million dollars from non-consortium sources and 45 
million dollars as relief assistance for refugees.

<a name="lhc"><b>Acting governor does not lose PA seat: LHC</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

LAHORE, April 18: A legislator who is directed by the President to 
officiate as provincial governor under Article 104 of the Constitution 
does not lose his parliamentary office under Article 103(2), Justice 
Mohammad Aqil Mirza observed on Tuesday while hearing a petition seeking 
vacation by acting governor Mohammad Hanif Ramay of his Punjab Assembly 
seat.

The petitioner, Advocate Rana Ilamuddin Ghazi, requested adjournment to 
produce a copy of the notification under which Mr Ramay assumed the 
office of acting governor. According to him, the notification showed 
that the PA speaker was an 'appointed' Governor and had, therefore, 
incurred the disability stipulated in Articles 103(2). The court granted 
him adjournment till April 23.

The constitutional petition seeks a direction to the Election Commission 
of Pakistan to declare that the provincial seat held by Mr Ramay has 
fallen vacant on account of his having assumed the office of governor of 
the Punjab. He has also ceased to be speaker of the Punjab Assembly, the 
petition says.

Relying on Clause 2 of Article 103 of the Constitution, the petition 
says that the seat of the provincial assembly held by Mr Ramay became 
vacant on the day he entered upon the office of the governor. Referring 
to Article 260 of the Constitution, it says that the governor includes 
acting governor. Therefore, the consequences spelt out in Article 103(2) 
are fully attracted in the case of the acting governor also.

The court on Tuesday drew the attention of the petitioner advocate to 
the provisions of Articles 101, 103 and 104 of the Constitution. Article 
101 provides that a person who is qualified to be elected as a member of 
the National Assembly and is not less than 35 years of age can be 
appointed governor. Article 103 provides that if a member of parliament 
of a provincial assembly is appointed as governor, his seat shall become 
vacant on the date he enters upon his office.

Article 104 provides that when the governor is absent from Pakistan or 
is unable to perform the function of his office due to any cause, such 
other person as the president may direct shall act as governor.

The court observed that the distinction in the appointment of the 
governor under Article 101 and direction to a person under Article 104 
to act as governor is apparent. In the case of the governor he is to be 
appointed by the President and he has to have certain qualifications. 
While in the case of acting governor any person has to be directed by 
the President to act as governor. Therefore, in the case of acting 
governor it is not the 'appointment' but 'a direction to a person' to 
act as governor for a limited period.

So far as the definition of the word "Governor", under Article 260 of 
the Constitution is concerned, it was pointed out that definitions given 
by the Article are not of absolute nature. The expressions used therein 
can have different meanings if the context of other provisions of the 
Constitution so requires. Clause (1) of Article 260 reads: "In the 
Constitution, unless the context otherwise requires, the following 
expressions have the meaning hereby respectively assigned to them."

"Therefore, the court further observed, it can be argued that the 
governor as mentioned in Articles 101, 102 and 103 of the 
Constitution, and the acting governor as mentioned in Article 104 are 
two different entities, with the result that a person who is directed 
to act as governor does not cease to hold the office as member of 
Parliament or a provincial assembly.

*From  Anjum Niaz

ISLAMABAD, April 18: Manila on Tuesday sought Islamabad's help to fight 
against terrorism and sign an anti-terrorist agreement to flush out 
Muslim militant groups operating from here who are believed to be 
involved in carrying out acts of terrorism in the Philippines.

Official sources told Dawn that the Philippines Interior Minister 
Raphael Alunan conveyed the proposal to his Pakistani counterpart 
Naseerullah Babar at a meeting here. Alunan is heading a ninemember 
delegation for talks with Pakistani officials and during his three-day 
stay he is expected to meet several senior police officials dealing with 
terrorism. He is scheduled to visit Peshawar also.

Diplomatic sources said Manila has complained about Muslim separatists 
groups in the Philippines having links with the Filipino Muslims living 
here and were receiving moral and material help from them.

Earlier, Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali said that Pakistan had 
pledged to fight against terrorism and will entertain the Philippine 
government's request for an agreement on anti-terrorist law.

It may be mentioned that thousands of Muslim militants came to 
Pakistan during the Afghan war when Pakistan and the US armed and 
trained them to fight the Soviet occupation forces in neighbouring 
Afghanistan. After the war, the militants stayed on and associated 
themselves with Afghan mujahideen groups and non-governmental 
organisations engaged in welfare work inside Afghanistan.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By A Correspondent

LAHORE, April 17: Twelve year old Iqbal Masih, president of the Bonded 
Child Carpet Workers, was shot dead on Sunday evening while he was going 
on a bicycle with two relatives to celebrate Easter in his native town 
of Muridke, some 25 km north of Lahore.

Two other boys, who were accompanying Iqbal, were injured in the 
shooting by unidentified people.

Iqbal Masih, who had won the Reebok Human Rights Award in December 1994, 
was caught unaware by the unidentified assailants. The killers escaped.   

The cause of the murder could not be ascertained immediately. But the 
Bonded Labour Liberation Front (BLLF) sources suspect that people in the 
hand-knotted carpet industry might be involved.

According to sources, Iqbal Masih had been associated with the carpet 
industry which he left two years ago. Subsequently, he joined a BLLF 
primary school in Class V near the Lahore High Court.

He became an activist and joined many BLLF rallies against bonded 
labour. He was also given a scholarship by an American University which 
he was supposed to join after matriculation.

The autopsy was carried out in a Sheikhupura hospital. He was buried in 
the graveyard of his village near Muridke. Many human rights activists 
attended his last rites.

<a name="oman"><b>Oman has not backed out: FO</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 13: Pakistan on Thursday said it had received no 
indication from the Omanese government regarding its backing out from a 
commitment to invest in Gwadar, as reported in a section of the Press on 
Thursday.

"We have not been conveyed any information concerning such a move by 
Oman," a senior Foreign Office official said in response to reports that 
quoted the Balochistan chief minister Zulfikar Ali Magsi saying that he 
had gathered during a meeting with Sultan Qaboos and his economic aide, 
Mr Zawawi - supposedly the main investor in Gwadar - that Oman was 
reneging on its commitment.

"We do not know in what context the conversation has been reported," the 
official said. He provided the background of the bilateral discussions 
during the meeting of the Joint Commission here last January, which was 
led by Omanese minister for trade.

According to the official, three concrete areas were agreed upon by 
Pakistan and Oman. They are: the establishment of a joint holding 
company with a 500 million dollar capability where each country would 
contribute 10 per cent and the rest would come from private sector for 
which the projects have already been identified; a triangularly ferry 
service linking Muscat, Karachi and Gwadar; and an agreement where 
Pakistan would provide technical assistance in industrial and 
agricultural fields to Oman. We regard this cooperation as very 
important in our bilateral relations and hope that Omani businessmen 
will continue to take interest and invest in Gwadar and Mekran," the 
official said. He, however, confirmed that the gifted plot from Ms 
Bhutto to Sultan Qaboos had still not materialised due to "procedural 
delays". He explained that the prime minister's proposal for gifting a 
plot of land to the Omanese sultan was put up to her by the interior 
ministry and duly approved by the Balochistan government, "but to find a 
plot of land which is free of joint titles (common in that area) is 
difficult," he said.

Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, April 15: Last Sunday's Shabqadar incident of ghastly killing 
of an Ahmadi lawyer in the court premises is in the process of being 
consigned to the old record room of the police station.

This Conclusion was drawn from the indications here and in Shabqadar. No 
finger has been lifted at the policemen who apparently failed to perform 
their duty to provide protection to the lives and property of people, 
with no transfers ordered and no inquiry called.

All evidence goes to point that the police department and the provincial 
government are keen to hush up the gory drama, fearing a backlash; and 
the backlash coming from the Prime Minister's office, they fear, will be 
more detrimental to their 'good name'. That happening, the government 
shall not be able to justify the recently announced Rs 20 million 
additional grant to the provincial police force. Nor would it be in a 
position to convince the Centre of a matching additional grant announced 
by the provincial chief executive some weeks back.

The government did not even bother to issue a statement as if a fly had 
been killed and the lynching of a human being was a matter of routine. 
No statement, no government handout and not even a clarification through 
a police press release even. What may happen subsequently is anybody's 
guess for the official attitude should have encouraged those who know 
how to settle the score with 'Kafir' and then also get away with it.

Injuries were visible on his face and the eyes were swollen.

He was bundled into his Mercedes car and taken to the Jatoi House in 
Defence where he was again given a severe beating. He was released late

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, April 17: The Supreme Court on Mondax allowed opposition MNA 
Ijaz Shafi to continue attending the National Assembly without voting 
right.

The order was used by a three member bench headed by Chief Justice 
Sajjad Hussain Shah during the hearing of Ijaz Shafi's appeal against 
the election tribunal order of unseating him from his National Assembly 
seat.

The election tribunal had twice unseated Ijaz Shafi from his seat and 
declared PPP member Masroor Ahsan elected in his place.

Mr Shafi, who had filed appeal in the Supreme Court against the 
tribunal's decision, was allowed by the court to attend the National 
Assembly proceedings but his voting right was stripped off.

During the hearing of the appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the case 
back to the tribunal for re-hearing it. The second decision was also 
against Mr Shafi forcing him to again approach the superior judiciary.

The Supreme Court had also barred Masroor Ahsan from taking the oath of 
his office till the final decision of the case.

While the court was rising for the day on Monday after hearing counsel 
for Mr Ahsan, Mr Shafi's lawyer Iftikhar Gilani stood up to point out 
that the people of the disputed constituency should not remain 
unpresented during the National Assembly session beginning from April 
19. He requested the court to allow his client to represent his 
constituency till the final decision.

Mr Ahsan's counsel Raja Anwar opposed the request and said a person who 
had been unseated twice by the election tribunal had no right to attend 
the session.

But Chief Justice Sajjad Hussain Shah suspended the impugned order of 
the election tribunal of unseating Mr Shafi till the final decision of 
the case and said that the relief provided earlier by the court would 
continue.

Mr Anwar said the relief was in favour of Mr Shafi and he might use 
delaying tactics to prolong the case to which the court observed that it 
would be decided earlier.

Some members strongly objected to the ordinance saying that it could be

unlimited powers to Punjab police,  notorious for extracting confessions 
through third degree methods.

The source said the Prime Minister concurred about the pitfalls in

Under this project, a long term adviser will be assigned to the Banking 
Inspection Department to develop and improve the on-site examination 
capabilities and procedures for the commercial banking sector.

As for the off-site supervision, the long term resident adviser will be 
assigned to the Banking Regulations Department in order to develop and 
improve the SBP's capability in off-site supervision techniques.

According to the World Bank document, the State Bank needs to strengthen 
its supervision and regulation function within an increasingly complex 
financial sector, improve the national payment system, train its staff, 
upgrade its information technology and modernise its library. For this 
purpose, the World Bank is offering 5.4 million dollars component of 
improving the SBP skills and capability in its 216 million dollars loan 
for Financial Sector Deepening and Intermediation Project (FSDIP).

<a name="kfha"><b>Trial operation by July : KFHA gets grant of Rs 96 million</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, April 15: A belated government grant of Rs 96 million for the 
Korangi Fisheries Harbour has finally raised the hope that a project 
which had been for the last 3 years would finally go into operation by 
July next.

The Korangi Fisheries Harbour built at a cost of around Rs 900 million, 
including an Asian Development Bank's (ADB) loan of $ 26 million (at 1 
percent service charge and 3 percent exchange risk fee), has so far 
remained idle.

It took the government three year to release funds badly needed for such 
small jobs as purchase of navigational aids, internal development of 
harbour and cost to be incurred for acquiring sanctioned power load from 
the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation.

The Korangi Fisheries Harbour Authority (KFHA), took over charge of the 
harbour from the British contractor after its completion in October 
1992, and ever since had been demanding funds for making the harbour 
operational.

KFHA last year approached the government, requesting a supplementary 
grant of Rs 35 million but the request fell on deaf ears.

However, on the intervention of the Prime Minister the Federal 
Government did not only accept the earlier demand of KFHA but also 
sanctioned an additional grant of Rs 61 million taking the total 
available funds to Rs 96 million for the project to come into 
operations.

<a name="comb"><b>Combating corruption through laws</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Shaukat Ali

LAHORE, April 16: It seems that at long last the government has realised 
that, besides other factors, it is the defects in the relevant laws 
which enable people to play havoc with public funds or commit gross 
irregularities while collecting taxes.

That is the background to the disclosure made by Minister of State for 
Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin here the other day about framing of fresh 
legislation to check the rampant looting and misuse of public funds.

When he was asked whether it was sufficient to merely remove a bad 
official from his post who had been involved, directly or indirectly, in 
plundering public funds, the minister said: "Not at all. But let me tell 
you frankly that the government's hands are tied under the existing 
legal framework, especially when it comes to taking action against those 
who are part of the government machinery."

He said his ministry had sent a draft proposal to the federal law 
division to frame new legislation recommending punishment for officials 
misappropriating public funds, according to the seriousness of their 
offence.

Whether this attempt signifies that the government means business, only 
time will tell. But there is no denying the fact that despite frequent 
outcries against corruption among public servants, from the lowest to 
the highest rung, no one so far has been put behind the bar. The common 
man, the main victim of this situation, is always told by even the 
lowliest bribetaker - like WAPDA linemen, for instance, that part of the 
bribe being demanded is for his high-ups. In most cases, he is not 
telling a lie. No wonder, if in such a situation it is the ruling party 
which gets the blame for being involved in corruption. The ambiguity in 
the law to punish undesirable elements in officialdom is contributing to 
the deterioration in the national economy.

It is galling for the honest tax payer to realise that the money he pays 
the state is liable to be siphoned off by corrupt officials. It is only 
the dishonest citizen who benefits from the existing system: tax can 
easily be evaded by greasing the right palms.

"It is true that a number of private-sector business tycoons do not pay 
full taxes/dues, but this is possible only when someone from among the 
tax-collecting departments joins hands with them," a former Lahore 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry president said when asked to comment on 
the proposed new law. "It is fair enough to enact a strict law to award 
capital punishment to culprits who misappropriate public funds, but who 
will ensure its implementation when the same government machinery is 
supposed to implement it?"

Mr Shahabuddin, however, is sure that once the opposition joins hands 
with the government in passing the new piece of legislation, the latter 
will go ahead to discard the corrupt officials by taking punitive action 
against them, including recovery of the embezzled amount.

This is not out of place to mention here that many governments in the 
past had taken drastic measures to control corruption, including 
dismissal of dishonest officers from service, but such steps did not 
seem to have yielded the desired results. One is not making a point that 
nothing should be done to overpower the spectre of vice, the argument is 
that making of new laws to tame misled officials works only when there 
is a strong political will to root out unrestrained corruption.

<a name="danc"><b>'No dancing shall be done'</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

THEATRE worker and actor Zia Moheyuddin appears to have taken up 
temporary residence in Lahore. He has also started writing a regular 
column for a local newspaper.

His 'readings' have in any case become an annual feature of the city's 
cultural life, and he kept up the tradition even when he was living in 
Britain. Perhaps for the first time, the Punjab government bestowed 
official recognition on the readings when the provincial information 
department and the Arts Council invited Zia for an evening at Alhamra 
last Wednesday.

Quite a few of those invited turned up, and generally they seemed to 
clap and laugh at the right moments. Zia's own sensitivity to the rapid 
decline in values and his wry sense of humour lend unusual depth to the 
prose and poetry pieces he reads out. The extract from Maee Dada was 
particularly moving.

Before he began his presentation, Zia pointed out that prior permission 
to stage the readings - parhanth - had to be sought from the district 
magistrate, and then he read out the text of the official letter of 
permission. Permission was given conditional to an assurance that "no 
dance would be done" - the exact words used - and Zia said: "No dance 
would be done. Iss Angrezi par to mar mitne ko ji chahata hey (one wants 
to sacrifice oneself at the altar of such English!). "There was also a 
prohibition on the use of obscene language, but Zia read out a four-
letter expression without batting an yield, and the chief secretary and 
provincial information secretary Badrul Islam - the host of the evening 
- both did suni ansuni, ignored the remark. What else could they do? And 
this only highlights the absurdity of this particular provision.

Lahore's own resident intellectual, Fakhr Zaman, in one of his first 
pronouncements after becoming the present government's cultural supreme, 
had promised that he would do away with the rule requiring prior 
permission to be obtained to stage a play or a performance. But the 
restriction remains, bad English and all.

<a name="thea"><b>PROFILE : Thriving on theatrical pursuits</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Leena Khaliq

Boundless feelings, creativity and energy blend harmoniously to form 
make-believe images, that herld an art form known as theatre. It is a 
powerful medium where a multitude of themes are explored and attitudes 
questioned. It is a celebration of the intellect as Khalil Gibran put 
it, "All words are but crumbs that fall down from the feast of the 
mind." And it is this highly versatile vein of artistic expression, that 
consumes the life of Madiha Gauhar.

She is one of those slightly controversial personalities, that over the 
years has been assigned many faces. Some of the phrases that have been 
used to describe her have been, "She's a little eccentric," or "She's a 
psuedo intellectual."

Thus prior to my meeting her, I had mentally concocted quite an 
elaborate dossier on her. A wonderful mishmash of hearsay and rabid 
gossip. I was brimming with excitement and anticipation as I arrived at 
her quaint home in the leafy confines of Cantonment in Lahore. It was a 
warm morning with the sun furtively peeping out of the dense foliage. 
And with the mail strewn all over the front porch, it was obvious that 
the household was still very much in the process of waking up to the 
burnished glory of the day.

The maid and a rather lean looking black cat made the reception 
committee, and it was a good twenty minutes before Madiha Gauhar made an 
unassuming appearance. She had a very friendly manner and exhibited none 
of the typical celebrity airs and graces, that can all too easily make 
your hackles rise and instigate one to launch into a tough line of 
questioning.

Once settled over coffee and an appetising array of munchables, it was 
more like being involved in an impassioned exploration of drama and its 
finer points rather than a calculated interview.

Madiha is someone who has managed to pack an extraordinary amount of 
commendable activity in a short span of time. Born and bred in Lahore, 
she appears to have been a bit of a rebel all along. Probably the reason 
why she has been misunderstood once too often. Just a few minutes of 
animated conversation, can make one sense the ferocious commitment with 
which she pursues her beliefs. Her's is an immense strength of character 
that simply cannot be ignored. Theatre is her forte - the roving Ajoka 
theatre where she gives ideas close to her heart tangible expression. It 
is a collaboration of talented artists, with Madiha and her well known 
playwright husband Shahid Nadeem at the helm.

The early years of her childhood were considerably ordinary, except for 
the unfortunate incident when her father passed away, laying all the 
responsibility of bringing up two young daughters on her mother's 
shoulders. Both of whom have managed to make their unique mark rather 
well. Even though they seem to come from different worlds on the 
surface, with Feryal sporting an incredibly glamorous image while Madiha 
seems to prefer the more bohemian strain of things. Yet scratch the 
surface and you find that frequently they have shared like thoughts and 
stood ground together.

Madiha's entry into the world of coherent live representations came very 
early on, in-the form of getting into stage acting while still at 
Kinnaird College Lahore. In fact she found the experience so exciting 
and interesting that further involvement on another level evolved. To 
quote Madiha, "Some of us got together and wrote a play, which we 
presented, that turned out to be a tremendous success."

It was at the age of seventeen that Madiha made her debut on television. 
When asked if it had been a struggle to secure permission from family 
quarters she says, "My mother was all right about it, but of course 
there were certain rules I had to observe. Shooting of dramas can be at 
odd hours so there were problems sometimes. But everybody in the 
business was so cooperative, they made me feel very comfortable. The 
old-timers did not give me a hard time, and it was a great learning 
experience for me."

Her dramatic pursuits progressed with flying colours as she went on to 
graduate from Kinnaird College and joined Government College Lahore for 
her Masters in English literature. Here her talents really blossomed and 
a new-found confidence in acting, producing and writing of plays came 
about. The atmosphere here was more liberal, and youthful dreams coupled 
with intellectual passions were at their pinnacle. As Madiha says, "As 
our dramas were met with appreciation, I developed this new-found 
confidence and felt that I could accomplish much more."

However it was not all smooth sailing in the theatre department, as 
increasingly she and her group of friends were beginning to tackle 
controversial and explosive subjects. The college administration wanted 
them to stay clear of such subjects, and repeatedly tried to ban the 
presentation of such plays. But by this time Madiha armed with supreme 
determination, was no pushover for anyone. The rebel in her fought 
against the stagnation of socially set norms. The words of Fatima 
Mernissi from her book. The Harem Within comes to mind, "You should not 
rebel stupidly. You ought to carefully consider the situation, and 
analyse everything. Rebel when you know there is a chance you may win."

Once Madiha acquired her Masters degree in literature, she opted for 
government service. In the process of becoming a lecturer at a 
university, she ended up getting posted to all sorts of way out places 
in Punjab. Life wasn't exactly peachy during this time, since she spent 
all week running against the clock, waking up at the crack of dawn, to 
travel numerous miles to her assigned location. But it was a steady 
income and the future seemed secure and predictable, with a government 
job in the tow.

Madiha by this time had become involved more and more in television 
plays as well as the stage, and her interest in directing was 
heightening also. As time went on, directing featured more strongly in 
her plans for the future. Simultaneously she was developing an awareness 
and sympathy towards feministic and political issues. She made efforts 
to portray the same in her work, trying to impart a message to the 
public. This brewed up a lot of trouble for her, resulting in her being 
banned from television for a number of years. It also threw her 
government job in jeopardy, bringing her to a sort of crossroads in 
life.

It was 1984 and by some stroke of luck an opportunity came along at this 
point, to escape from all the complex entanglements and go to London for 
a year to study direction for theatre. It was a difficult choice for 
Madiha, because it meant burning all her boats. It meant resigning from 
her job and starting afresh on coming back.

Deciding that it was too good an opportunity to pass, she threw caution 
to the wind and stepped towards a more promising future. In Madiha's 
words "it was a great experience, I learnt a lot and it gave me a 
valuable and totally different perspective."

When questioned if this added exposure perhaps gave her an edge over 
others who were not fortunate enough to have similar opportunities, she 
seemed to word her answer carefully. She said that she won't deny that 
it certainly opened up her vision to much more than she had previously 
been familiar with in her chosen field. However, the most invaluable 
asset to have in her opinion is experience. It is the experience of a 
job, in the environment that you have to finally operate in, that really 
makes the difference at the end of the day.

The Ajoka theatre came into being, when Madiha and her husband who has 
many well received plays to his credit felt that a theatre on wheels was 
needed. The overtly feminist play Neela Haath in which Madiha Gauhar 
also acted, bought Shahid Nadeem much acclaim. Currently he not only 
writes most of the plays presented by the Ajoka group, but continues to 
whip up creditable material for television as well.

Ajoka's aim from the very beginning has been, simple productions where 
the emphasis is on the storyline rather than on creating fine 
fripperies. The stage is usually quite devoid of elaborate sets and 
frequent curtain calls, to bring in different backdrops and flashy 
salient features.

Besides providing light entertainment, their plays with their 
undercurrents of live issues grip the audience. A great deal of thought 
goes into these plays, the visual aspect is just as potent as the 
dialogue. Music often plays a major role in the plays, as it provides 
relief from the directness that is practised in getting the ideas 
across.

Ajoka is constantly being approached by various agencies to do plays 
highlighting a particular cause or subject, be it the environment or 
population planning. But Madiha says, "We make it clear that we need a 
free hand and no interference, otherwise we will not be able to do a 
good job."

They have been pioneers in introducing street theatre in Pakistan, and 
are constantly on the move, performing even in remote areas of Punjab 
Sindh and Balochistan. It's instrumental in bringing about social 
change, to build awareness and a realisation of what needs to be 
concentrated upon in the future. Madiha identifies with this train of 
thought very closely, and it is an ever-changing challenging proposition 
for her to try and accomplish.

Yet with so much cluttering her day-to-day living, she still manages to 
find time for some television plays every now and then. Of recent she 
has acted in Zard Dupahir and Nashaaib. The Ajoka group also organises 
workshops on theatre skills and socially relevant subjects in small 
communities.

Since Madiha feels that even though the importance of good theatre is 
now being understood in Pakistan, much of the offerings are still very 
mediocre. The focus does not seem to be shifting at the right pace 
towards ingenuity and exploration into the field. Most theatre groups 
are continuing to ape western jargon which can backfire by being 
inappropriate for our audiences.

Some may disagree with her by stating that theatre should be treated as 
an instrument of entertainment only, and not exploit the potential 
powers of street theatre by loading it with radical or political 
overtones. To quote Fatima Mernissi once again from The Harem Within, "I 
still dream of that wonderful day when I will stage a theatrical 
revolt." It would seem that Madiha has no need to dream of that anymore, 
for she is making it happen right now!

<a name="deba"><b>Anwar blames key batsmen for debacle</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Our Sports Reporter

KARACHI, April 14: Saeed Anwar, the aggressive opener who led the 
Pakistan cricket team against Sri Lanka in the Asia Cup, said the major 
reasons for the ouster from the competition were the failure of himself 
and Aamir Sohail and absence of Aqib Javed in the most crucial game.

In a telephonic conversation with Dawn from Lahore, Saeed Anwar stated 
that prior to the competition, the batting was heavily dependent on him, 
Aamir Sohail and Inzamamul Haq.

"Only Inzamam rose to the occasion while we both failed to deliver the 
goods. My and Aamir's failure in the match against Sri Lanka gave a jolt 
to our planning, which was to pile up 210 plus in that match.

"Had we played our roles properly, we would not only have achieved our 
prime target of 209 runs but we also would have dictated the terms," 
Saeed stated.

Saeed added that after his and Aamir's dismissal, the middle order 
batsmen did not come to terms. "They did not lend any support to 
Inzamam. I think it's time that the confidence and maturity of the 
youngsters should also be scrutinised before inducting them in the 
highest level of the game."

The left-hander stated that the other handicap of the Pakistan team was 
the injury of Aqib Javed forcing him to skip the match. "His absence 
left only Wasim Akram as the lone strike bowler. Though Wasim bowled 
quite impressively, he failed to get any support from other bowlers."

Saeed said had Aqib been fit, Pakistan would have made the target of Sri 
Lanka quite difficult. "Aamir Nazeer and Zafar Iqbal, I think, miserably 
failed to plug the vacuum."

They (the pacers) had to bowl as nobody else was going to take over 
their job."

Saeed said though Pakistan were beaten in the Asia Cup, the significant 
aspect was that even with a second eleven, it defeated a formidable 
Indian team. "It proves that we had the guts and the potential to win 
the title but it was bad luck that the title eluded us."

<a name="alta"><b>Saleem Altaf Says : Team in rebuilding process</b>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
*From  Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, April 13: Tour Manager Saleem Altaf opined on return from 
Sharjah that the Pakistan cricket team was in the process of rebuilding 
and could be groomed into a good combination. The process was going to 
be slow and painful but it was hoped that good things would come out 
after some experimentations.

While answering a question the former Test paceman Saleem Altaf said 
that now the Pakistan team was left with only two experienced batsmen 
and two bowlers. About the comeback of the deposed captain Salim Malik 
and Ejaz Ahmad Senior into the national team, he said that it was up to 
the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to decide about them.

Saleem Altaf said that Javed Miandad could be also considered for 
selection in the Pakistan team whenever the 'master batsman' showed his 
availability.

The Tour Manager said that the Pakistan team could not play well against 
Sri Lanka as the team management was dogged with a plethora of problems. 
Captain Moin Khan had fallen ill. Aquib Javed reported to be unfit on 
the morning of the match. Ijaz Ahmad Junior had to sit out of the Asia 
Cup due to injury. It looked difficult on the morning of the match to 
field eleven players for the match. To make things worse, the Pakistan 
team was off to a disastrous start. It had lost five wickets for 38 runs 
but it recovered remarkably to score 178 runs mainly due to excellent 
performance of Inzamam-ul-Haq and some youngsters. He was all praise for 
the courageous player Inzamam-ul-Haq who played well throughout the Asia 
Cup. He said that injury to paceman Aquib Javed was a big blow to the 
Pakistan team which upset its balance. Saleem Altaf felt that it was 
futile to offer excuses for the defeat against Sri Lanka but no one need 
to doubt our commitment of rebuilding the Pakistan team slowly. He said 
that all the available players will be given chances to prove their 
merit and a loss in a match or a tournament was not the end of the world 
for Pakistan cricket.
