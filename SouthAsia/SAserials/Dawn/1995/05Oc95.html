<a name="step">Steps urged to arrest worsening Karachi situation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 3: Karachi is passing through a macabre period and needs 
immediate steps to rein in the drifting situation as every passing day 
is not only bringing a bad name to the government but also inflicting 
untold miseries on the people.
This was almost the consensus of speakers present at the book 
launching ceremony, <b>The Karachi Papers</b>, written by Iqbal Yusuf, a 
PPP leader and adviser to the Sindh chief minister.
Those who spoke on this occasion included eminent writer Shaukat 
Siddiqui, politicians Prof Ghafoor Ahmad of JI, Prof Shah Farid-ul-Haq 
of JUP and Sindh Minister for Planning Nisar Ahmad Khuhro. Mahmood 
Sham, editor, Jang, recited his two poems on Karachi.
Shaukat Siddiqui, author of the famous novel <b>Khuda ki Basti</b>, in his 
presidential speech stressed the need for holding direct talks with 
MQM chief Altaf Hussain. He recalled: "The governments which till 
yesterday called Nelson Mandela and Yasser Arafat terrorists, now hold 
talks with them, so why not our government. Whether you call Altaf 
Hussain a murderer, an executioner or a terrorist, the solution to 
Karachi's crisis lies in holding talks with him."
Mr.Siddiqui said: "It is the duty of the government to protect lives 
and property of the people and any government which fails to discharge 
this basic responsibility has no right to govern."
Advising people to read <b>The Karachi Papers</b> to understand the crisis, 
he lauded the courage of the author who, although belonging to the 
ruling party, had made observations and suggestions which differed 
from  the government perception.
Prof Ghafoor Ahmad, JI deputy chief, quoting from the book said the 
young politician had given a truthful account of the present state of 
affairs in the city when said: "Karachi is being ruined, its streets 
are mourning, and bodies littered in bazaars. There is chest beating 
and wailing in houses and quietness at shops. Factories are being 
rendered unviable and such an atmosphere of terrorism is prevailing 
that every citizen is a prisoner of fear."
The JI leader lamented that the PPP government in its third regime had 
adopted "a policy to meet terrorism with terrorism. No where in the 
world terrorism can be overcome through use of force," he added.
Referring to the MQM-government talks, he said no one appeared to be 
serious in negotiations. Without naming law minister N.D. Khan and 
interior minister Naseerullah Babar, he pointed to "contradictions" in 
their approach saying: "The federal government has taken over control 
of Karachi. People are being killed in police encounter.
What type of democracy we have in which a minister speaks of people 
being killed in encounters and no one is there to check him. Had it 
been some other civilised country, the minister would have been tried 
for murder," Prof Ghafoor added.
The JI leader said the "oppressed" people of Karachi had became 
hostage in the hands of the PPP and the MQM .
Prof Shah Farid-ul-Haq, JUP vice president, said although the 
government used to claim that a foreign hand was involved in the 
Karachi crisis, it had failed to come out with proofs.
Referring to the 18 demands of the MQM, he said most of them could be 
accepted outright if the government was sincere. Similarly, he said, 
Altaf Hussain should demand of the government the setting up of a 
judicial commission to investigate the 21 charges framed by the 
government against the MQM.

KARACHI, Sept 28: New irritants developed on Thursday which may 
further delay the resumption of stalled talks between the government 
and the MQM.
The irritants were the arrest of the brother-in-law of MQM chief Altaf 
Hussain and refusal by the police guard to let the MQM negotiating

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent LONDON, Sept 29: The latest killing of three
Mohajir Qaumi Movement workers has been described by party chief Altaf
Hussain as "a most heinous case of mass and collective execution by
extra-judicial means".  In a statement, he said in May 1994 five MQM
workers were killed in identical manner by the law enforcement
agencies in Sukkur. Mr Hussain said, "The killings deserve the
harshest condemnation since this lays the foundation of utter
lawlessness and chaos." He disputed the government version that one of
the deceased - Ferozuddin - was killed in a police shoot-out in which
two other MQM workers, Pervez Akhtar and Mohammad Ali, were also
killed.  He said Pervez was arrested on September 5 from his North
Karachi house, while Mohammad Ali, of Liaquatabad, was arrested on
September 26 from a marriage hall in Karimabad where he had gone to
attend a wedding.  He described as "preposterous" the official version
put out about Pervez and said the three - Ferozuddin, Pervez and
Mohammad Ali  were all brought together on Thursday and killed at
point-blank range.  Mr Hussain said that Ferozuddin was arrested on
September 19 and was, after a week's remand, produced before Qazi
Mohammad Akbar, who presided the Special Terrorist Activity Court. The
judges attention was drawn to the severe injuries which Ferozuddin
had suffered during custody.  "The court denied the government
request for a personal remand of the detainee. But it appears that he
was never sent to jail and was instead murdered." Judge Qazi Akbar
was transferred by the government to Dadu, said Mr Hussain, "an
action which deserves admonition" because he earned the
administration's wrath.  He appealed to the Bar bodies to voice
concern at the manipulation of judicial system.  DWS 950930

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter KARACHI, Sept 29: The MQM coordination committee on
Friday alleged the police had killed Mohammad Ali and Ferozuddin, MQM
workers, in a fake police encounter in New Karachi on Thursday.  In a
statement, the committee said: "The Nazimabad police had arrested
Mohammad Ali him on Sept 24 at Afshan Palace, a marriage hall, in
Karimabad. He was in police custody when killed. It alleged the police
showed his arrest on Sept 26 and handed him over to the New Karachi
police on Sept 28.  In another statement, the MQM fact finding
committee alleged the rangers and police had arrested Ferozuddin on
Sept 18. The statement also mentioned the arrest of his two brothers
and father.  It alleged Feroz had been tortured from Sept 18 to 26 in
police custody. The police produced him on Sept 24 before the
Suppression of Terrorists Activities (STA) Court No.1.  The FFC said
the honourable judge after having examined marks of torture on the
body of Feroz, refused further remand to police and sent him on
judicial remand to jail.  It alleged that contrary to the verdict of
the court, the police took him to an unknown destination and tortured
him for two days. The judge who gave the relief to Feroz, was
transferred to Dadu.  It alleged the police had killed him and two
other MQM workers - Mohammad Ali and Pervez Akhtar - on Thursday
night in Muslim Rajput Colony, New Karachi.  In another statement, MQM
Parliamentary Party Leader in Sindh Assembly Shoaib Bokhari alleged
the police and rangers had arrested Pervez Akhtar on Sept 5 at his
home in New Karachi. "The law enforcers kept him in Khwaja Ajmernagri
police station for few days and after that handed him over to the
rangers,".  Mr Bokhari alleged Pervez, too, was killed in a fake
police encounter on Sept 28 in New Karachi.  In another statement,
Kanwar Younus Khalid and Prof A. K. Shams, two detained members of the
co-ordination committee, demanded of the government to release
immediately Mohammad Aslam, the brother-in-law of MQM chief Altaf
Hussain.  Ishtiaq Azhar: The Convenor of MQM Co-ordination Committee,
Senator Ishtiaq Azhar, has expressed concern over reports of torture
on Qamar Mansoor in Adyala Jail, Rawalpindi.  In a statement, he
alleged Mr Mansoor had not yet been produced in any court after his
arrest three months back and his one leg had been paralysed owing to
torture in the jail while he was suffering from severe pain in the
other. If he is not provided immediate medical aid, he may not be
able to walk, he said.

KARACHI, Sept 30: The MQM co-ordination committee has called for a day 
of protest on Sunday to mourn the alleged killing by the rangers and 
the police of three of its activists in custody.
The call was given on Saturday after nine people died in the day-long 
violence on Friday.
The committee alleged that torture of MQM workers and supporters was 
rampant and part of a plan to exterminate the Mohajir community.
It alleged that on Thursday night three detained activists of the MQM

The MQM committee in its initial appeal had asked everyone, including 
journalists, to stay indoors to participate in the protest.
However, when this question was raised with the chief MQM negotiator 
and editor of Amn, Ajmal Dehlavi, a clarification was issued by the 
co-ordination committee which said journalists should visit the 
affected areas and the families of those who were allegedly killed in 
fake encounters by the police and rangers.

<a name="dehl">Dehlavi links resumption of talks to judicial probe</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 1:The chief MQM negotiator, Ajmal Dehlavi, on Sunday made 
resumption of talks conditional on a judicial enquiry into the alleged 
killings of MQM activists in captivity and a positive reply to his 
letter addressed to his government opposite number.
He was responding to the chief government negotiator N.D. Khans 
Saturday remarks in which he had asked the MQM team to fix a new date, 
venue and timing for the 10th round.
No progress has been achieved in the negotiations because the 
government is not sincere said Mr Dehlavi adding: On the one hand 
the government is saying that it wants negotiations to succeed while 
on the other it has unleashed state terrorism. It is essential that 
this state terrorism against Mohajirs  must come to an end , he 
emphasised.
Mr Dehlavi alleged that the government was criticising strike calls by 
the MQM but it has never bothered to know the causes for these calls. 
He claimed that this year alone about 15,000 MQM supporters and 
activists had been killed, but in spite of repeated protests by the 
MQM none of the persons responsible for the deaths had been 
apprehended.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dawn Report
HYDERABAD, Oct 1: Fourteen people were injured in Hyderabad during the 
strike called by the Mohajir Qaumi Movement (MQM) to protest against 
the custodial death of three of its activists in Karachi.
Vehicular traffic in these cities remained affected while the twin 
cities of Hyderabad and Latifabad, and Mirpurkhas reverberated with 
the sound of gunfire and cracker explosions.
In Hyderabad, pitched battles were fought between the personnel of law 
enforcement agencies and the youths with muffled faces.
A powerful molotov cocktail exploded in Ghaziabad in which at least 12 
people, including 11 children, were injured. They were admitted to the 
Liaquat Medical College Hospital.
A pedestrian, Chaman Gul, received bullet injuries at Pacca Qilla. A 
yellow cab was set ablaze in Latifabad.
ASI Masood Iqbal received bullet injuries in Mumtaz Colony where he 
had gone to arrest some wanted persons. Soon after the police entered 
the colony, they were attacked by the youth who got freed Malik Subhan 
and Malik Akbar from the police custody. The two had informed the 
police about the presence of the wanted men in the area.
Police, however, arrested a man, Mohammad Ishaque.
Station Road near Lady Dufferin Hospital became the battle ground 
where youth and the rangers exchanged fire. The Jamaat-i-Islami office 
located nearby was particularly targeted by the youth. As a result the 
building was damaged.
Fire was also exchanged between the protesters and the law enforcement 
agencies at Seroghat and Goods Naka. The other affected areas were Al-
Rahim Shopping Centre, Makki Shah Road, Sarfaraz Chari, Pacca Qilla

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
KARACHI, Oct 2: In a letter addressed to UN Secretary-General Boutrous

Altaf Hussains letter to the UN chief.
Mr Hussain had written the letter alleging brutal and inhuman extra-
judicial executions of the supporters of the MQM and the Mohajir 
nation by Pakistani government.
The CMs advisor asserted that all Pakistanis enjoyed equal rights as 
citizens of a sovereign country. Having migrated to Pakistan, the 
Mohajirs also enjoy equal rights as citizens of Pakistan.
However, he claimed that ethnic violence in Karachi started with the 
emergence of MQM in 1986. The violence was aimed against Pakhtoons 
and Punjabis and subsequently against Sindhis and Baloch. Then 
Mohajirs were pitted against Mohajirs.
The advisor said Mr Hussain, from his cosy abode in London is not 
only promoting violence, militancy and terrorism, but is also 
unleashing massive, false propaganda to malign the government and 
state of Pakistan.
He concluded that the Pakistan government is fully aware of its 
obligations to various human rights covenants, such as dignity of 
women, the right to a fair trial and observing the requisite norms of 
providing proper defence facility to any individual accused of any 
crime, according to the Constitution of Pakistan and international

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ISLAMABAD, Oct 2: Former chief of the Inter Services Intelligence 
(ISI) Lt-Gen (retd) Hamid Gul has said that use of force and armed 
confrontation cannot lead to a political settlement of the crisis in 
Karachi.
Talking to PPI in Rawalpindi on Monday, he suggested that the 
government should stop the Operation Clean-up and the MQM should end 
their agitation and resorting to strike.
Mr Gul, urged both the government and the MQM to immediately resume 
the talks. He underscored the need for taking confidence-building 
measures by both the sides for the success of the negotiation. Both 
the government and the MQM should avoid issuing hostile statements 
against each other, he added.
The former army general stressed the need for adopting sagacious 
political will to accept compromises without prejudices to the 
rational and just position of one or the other side.
He called upon the government to pay attention to the MQM concern over 
their missing women workers and alleged custodial killings of their 
supporters.
He said the situation in Karachi was rapidly deteriorating and it 
might soon be difficult to contain it with ordinary measures. The 
strife, he said, had all the potential for degenerating into a wider 
and more menacing conflict. He said there was an immediate need for 
political remedies, dousing of emotional fire and setting a stage for

LONDON, Oct 3: The killing of three MQM workers in the last 24 hours 
has been condemned by MQM leader Altaf Hussain, who said that since 
the visit to Karachi of the president the activities of the Haqiqi 
Group had increased. The Haqiqis and government agencies were blamed 
by him for the latest killings.
He said Mukarram Ali Hashmi was murdered by assailants who entered his

centre. Shakil Ahmad was abducted under official supervision and 
was later killed in front of a police station.
Mr Hussain criticised the president for not acting against the 
official repression. The MQM, he added, would be justified in using 
its right of strike as protest if the government continued with its

Liaquat Hussain, a member of the MQM negotiating team, would be handed 
over to him on Thursday and the police mobiles which had been 
withdrawn on Oct 2 would again be detailed for the security of MQM

Talking to Dawn, chief MQM negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi said he was 
informed about the release of Shazia Farooq on Wednesday night.
Zuhair Akram Nadeem, MNA, and a member of the government negotiating 
team met the chief MQM negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi to inform him about 
the steps taken by the government to remove the irritants and ensure 
resumption of talks.
After the meeting, Mr Dehlavi told newsmen he had made it clear that 
the MQMs decision to resume talks was linked to a positive reply from 
the chief government negotiator, N.D.Khan.
Mr Nadeem reaffirming the governments desire to bring the talks to a 
positive conclusion said the reply would be delivered on Thursday.
Mr Dehlavi said when the reply was received, his colleagues would go 
through its contents and decide whether to resume talks or not.
Both sides, nevertheless, shared the perception that all issues could 
be resolved through negotiations and impasse in the talks was not in 
the interest of anyone.
The MQM chief negotiator was also informed that no one named Raees 
Fatima was in government custody, but if she had been booked under 
some other name, efforts would be made to trace her.
When Mr Dehlavi raised the question of permission for the negotiating 
team to meet the interned MPA, Qamar Mansoor, Mr Nadeem said this 
issue could be discussed during talks.
He said that Mr Nadeem had assured him that there was no restriction 
on MQMs political activities and there would be no difficulties if 
any member of the negotiating team travelled abroad.
Replying to a question Mr Dehlavi said he got the impression that the

<a name="brow">Brown Amendment clearance held up</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
WASHINGTON, Sept 28: The Foreign Aid Bill, carrying among other 
appropriations the Brown Amendment favouring Pakistan and the US aid 
for Israel and Egypt, got stuck in the intermediary stage just because 
its manager introduced an unauthorised amendment opposing the Burmese 
military regime.
Pakistani diplomats and lobbyists, waiting tensely for their amendment 
to clear the conference were shocked to learn that the Bill Manager 
had delayed the whole thing because of an amendment on Burma which had 
not been moved in the House.
A senior Republican aide said: It violates all Senate rules of 
tradition and comity to surreptitiously insert an important amendment 
that does not have unanimous consent.
Reports said Thursday disagreement broke out among Senate Republicans 
over the amendment slipped in by Mitch McConnell after the passage of 
the Bill. The amendment would withdraw the most-favoured nation 
trading status to any country that does not back sanctions against 
Burma.
The Bill seeking a 10 per cent cut on all foreign aid, was passed by 
the Senate last week with a thumping majority of 91 to 9 but there was 
no amendment against the Burmese military government moved by any 
Senator. Hank Browns Amendment on Pakistan was the most debated 
subject of the Bill.
After its passage the Bill was sent for reconciliation with the 
version passed by the House of Representatives and a conference of 
nominees of the two Houses was expected on Thursday or Friday.
While Pakistanis were waiting for the conference to clear the Bill as 
it appears to have almost unanimous support, mostly because it 
contains the annual aid for Israel, the new hitch created by Mitch 
McConnel delayed matters.
Reports said while floor managers of bills often insert amendments 
that have unanimous support, several lawmakers criticised Sen. Mitch 
McConnell for inserting an amendment, without unanimous backing, that 
could have huge repercussions.
Several lawmakers said the Bill could, for instance, cut off Chinas 
most-favoured status because Beijing does not honour sanctions against 
Burma.
After the Senate approved the Bill last Thursday, Sen. John McCain, a 
Republican high-up on foreign policy, took the Senate floor to attack 
the way the amendment on Burma was inserted.
I was quite upset about it and thought it was highly inappropriate to 
do it, McCain said in an interview. I have a special concern about 
Burma  60 per cent of the heroin coming to the United States comes 
through that country  and if there was an amendment on the issue, I 
wanted to be involved in the debate.
Joining this unusual intra-party feud, Sen. William Roth, who is 
chairman of the Finance Committee, wrote a letter to McConnell 
expressing his great disappointment with the amendment. Roth 
complained not only that the provision involved matters that were the 
jurisdiction of his committee, but also that its call for withdrawing 
most-favoured-nation trading status would violate trade treaties.
In an interview McConnell admitted he had inserted the amendment 
without a vote.
In addition to calling for suspending trade privileges to countries 
that do not honour sanctions against Burma, McConnells amendment 
calls for banning travel to Burma, barring Burmese imports and 
withholding money to the IMF if it provides aid to Burma.

<a name="amen">Brown Amendment clearance delayed by 10 days</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai
WASHINGTON, Sept 29: The clearance of the Brown Amendment by the two 
Houses of US Congress has been delayed by at least 10 days. Pakistani 
sources said there were three reasons for the delay and none of it 
concerned Pakistan or any lack of support for the amendment which 
would release military equipment and lift economic sanctions on 
Pakistan.
The reasons given by Pakistani sources include the lifting of the 
threat of a deadlock which would have brought the government to a halt 
on October 1. The Congress and the White House have agreed to a six-
week extension of the budgetary allocations and so the deadline is no 
longer there.
The second reason is said to be the differences within the Republican 
party on a number of issues which need to be reconciled between the 
Senate and the Lower House, though the Brown Amendment is not one of 
them.
The rush in the Senate to pass 13 bills before the recess began on 
Friday has also helped Pakistan in some way - it has kept the angry 
Californian Senator Dianne Feinstein from moving her amendment to 
dilute the Brown Amendment.
Feinstein wants to force a vote in the Senate, just as Brown did to 
amend the Pressler Amendment, to exclude the transfer of weapons to 
Pakistan but she still supports the lifting of economic sanctions and 
other provisions including the return of money for F-16s and other 
arms.
Pakistani diplomats were worried that Feinstein may still make a last 
ditch effort on late Friday afternoon but no one was prepared to rate 
her chances of success as high.
The delay in holding of the conference on the Foreign Operations Bill 
means at least 10 more days for Feinstein to lobby for her amendment 
because she thinks that the members of the House of Representatives 
could be persuaded not to agree to the arms transfer clause.
The House, in its version, had approved only lifting of economic 
sanctions but the Senate added the transfer of 370 million dollars 
worth of arms and return of the money for the F-16s in its version.

KARACHI, Sept 28: Three constitutional petitions challenging the 
licence granted to the hotelier group of Avaris of Karachi for setting 
up a brewery came up for hearing before a division bench of the High 
Court of Sindh, comprising the acting Chief Justice, Justice Abdul 
Hafeez Memon and Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui of the High Court of 
Sindh on Thursday.
The petitioners have challenged the authority of the provincial 
government of Sindh to grant the licence to Beach Brewery on the 
ground that such licence offends against constitutional provisions, 
Article 2-A, the Objectives Resolution and Article 31-H which enjoins 
upon the state to discourage sale and consumption of liquor.
He said there was a complete lack of legislative competence 
authorising making of any law to permit manufacture and sale of 
intoxicating liquor and thus the relevant law under which the license 
was granted to Beach Brewery.
The only status of all these laws was that of sub-constitutional 
legislation, which is in direct conflict with the constitution 
itself, and hence have to give way to the overriding provisions of 
the Constitution which must prevail instead.

accusing India of massive human rights violations in the occupied 
Jammu and Kashmir and not implementing the United Nations resolutions 
on the dispute, the Indian delegate launched a tirade against 
Pakistan.
Exercising its right of reply, the Indian delegate, Nalin Surie, 
accused Pakistan of not abiding by the Security Councils resolutions 
by not withdrawing from Kashmiri territory it had forcibly occupied.
Pakistan in its rebuttal said the Indian delegate was distorting the 
Security Councils resolution as the resolution had stipulated 
withdrawal of both countries forces simultaneously so that plebiscite 
could be held under the UN auspices.
Pakistans chief delegate to the United Nations, Ahmad Kamal accused 
India of terrorising the Kashmiri population by using its massive army 
against the unarmed people.
He also accused Indian intelligence agencies of masterminding the 
drama of hostage-taking by the so-called Al-Faran group, in order to 
somehow implicate Pakistan in the hostage-taking.
Nalin Surie accused Pakistan of fomenting terrorism in the Indian held 
Kashmir and in Afghanistan asserting that Al-Faran and Taliban were 
being financed by Pakistan.
He said the Charar Sharief shrine had been burnt down by a Pakistani 
mercenary, Must Gul, who had taken refuge in Pakistan. 
Responding to Pakistan foreign ministers assertion that India had 
embarked upon arms race in the sub-continent aimed against Pakistan, 
the Indians pointed out that the recent amendment in the Pressler law 
by the US Congress had given Pakistan more weaponry than ever before.

brought to the attention of the Governor, SBP, for his comments. The 
Governor would like to clarify that he is not aware of any decision by 
the government to devalue the rupee and that the State Bank would 
continue to follow the policy of managed float.
There should be no question in anybodys mind that as long as we are 
unable to improve our trade and current account deficits the rupee 
shall continue to follow the path of uninterrupted, persistent 
devaluation. The real question in this regards thus is the modality 
and the time frame. The Commerce Minister calls it slow devaluation 
of the rupee and the Governor euphemises it as managed float. The 
end result is most certainly a crawling Rs.-$ peg or a crawling 
devaluation. In the present situation where expectations of a 
devaluation[based essentially on negative fundamentals] have been 
built up by official as well as quasi-official sources most private 
sector economic participants are now facing a highly uncertain and a 
potentially volatile foreign exchange scenario.
On the foreign front-while the official stated policy of the highest 
office in the land is to attract overseas investment to reignite the 
lagging economy-foreign investors are becoming increasingly hesitant 
of investing into rupee-denominated assets again in expectation of an 
imminent devaluation. Barring Securities International Limited has 
estimated that investors will move some $25 billion into developing 
countries courses in 1995, the third target inflow on record. The 
mere anticipation of a major devaluation in Pakistan is bound to keep 
all the $25 billion away from our stock markets; money that can prove 
to be a bonanza for our sinking markets.
Uncertainty and volatility being the prime impediments in the growth 
of an economy, its time now that the entrepreneurial forces of this 
countrys private sector are released of the burden of both 
uncertainty and volatility. Our rupee has truly become overvalued and 
our official policy of gradual devaluation now poses a threat to our 
economy and has also become a major obstacle in the attraction of 
foreign capital. What is required is a good five per cent to 10 per 
cent one-time depreciation eventually followed by the usual crawling 
peg.

<a name="rene">Renewed violence depresses stocks</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
STOCKS maintained a bearish outlook during the preceding week as a 
chain of renewed violence in the city kept investors at their toes.
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices, therefore, broke the 
barrier of 1,700 points for the second time during the last about six 
months and many analysts believe it could take breather around 1,600. 
It was last quoted at 1655.55 as compared to 1,725.32 a week earlier, 
reflecting the distinct weakness of the base shares despite a feeble 
weekend rally. All shares index also followed the same pattern falling 
form the peak level of 966.27 to around 950.
The market capitalisation suffered a fresh contraction of about Rs. 12 
billion over the week falling from Rs. 370 billion to Rs. 358 billion 
and dealers predicted it could move further down owing to city 
situation.
Although there were more sellers than buyers as every one is looking 
for an opportunity to get out of the market at least for the near-term 
at until there is peace in the city, but the steep decline in prices 
over the last about eight months have left not many options before 
them to reach safe havens.
Dealers said the market is faced with more bad news than good ones 
both from the law and order and political fronts and until there is a 
breather the possibility of a sustained recovery appeared to be 
remote.
The rupee might not be devalued in a big way but persistent rumours 
are prompting a good bit of selling from the foreign investors.
Chemicals and farm shares remained on the receiving-end all through 
under the lead of ICI Pakistan including its right shares, which it 
hit the years lowest level around Rs. 64.
It was followed by Welcome Pakistan, Otsuka Pakistan, Engro Chemicals, 
but Ciba-Geigy was in exception, which posted a smart gain of Rs. 7 on 
active short-covering at the lower levels.
A big fall in PSO featured the trading in the energy shares, which 
fell in unison under the lead of National Refinery, KESC, Pakistan 
Refinery and Ebrahim Energy. Hub-Power was massively traded amid 
erratic movements.
Cement shares followed them as most of the leading among them suffered 
fresh pruning on renewed selling. Cherat rose modestly after the 
dividend but later reacted. Other losers were led by Zeal-Pakistan, 
Dandot and Pakland Cement.
Auto shares were actively traded but mostly on the lower side, major 
losers among them being Atlas-Honda, Pak-Suzuki Motors, Indus Motors.
Both PIAC and PTC vouchers in the transport sector were actively 
traded on news of enhanced earnings finally closing modestly higher.
Synthetic shares were massively traded under the lead Dhan Fibre and 
Dewan Salman but latter received heavy battering, falling sharply 
lower.
Insurance shares also followed the markets general trend, falling 
under the lead of ALICO, EFU, Dadabhoy and some others.
Investment shares fell fractionally under the lead of modarabas, 
leasing shares but some of the bank shares managed to recover modestly 
under the lead of Bear Stearns, Al-Faysal Bank, KCB, and some others 
on stray covering purchases.
Trading volume showed a sizable expansion at 68 million shares thanks 
to massive activities in most of the current favourites. Alternate 
bouts of buying and selling, however, the key-note of trading as 
nobody was inclined to take long positions owing to an uncertain 
future outlook.

<a name="stat">State Bank abolishes credit-deposit ratio</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Sept 30: The State Bank of Pakistan abolished on Saturday the 
credit deposit ratio on banks as instrument to regulate private sector 
credit through market-based instruments such as open market 
operations.
The press release was issued on Saturday afternoon by the Central 
Board of Directors of SBP which mentioned the abolition of deposit 
credit ratio describing it as last step towards the market based 
credit and monetary management.
The credit plan for 1995-96 sets a limit of Rs 64.23 billion for the 
private sector as against Rs 66.32 billion credit availability to non-
government sector. The original limit set for private sector credit 
plan for 1994-95 was Rs 44.60 billion but was revised to Rs 55.44 
billion. Actual credit availability to private sector till June 22 
last was Rs 49.16 billion but it abnormally expanded by Rs 17 billion 
in a week time to end up at Rs 66.32 billion on June 30 showing an 
excess of Rs 11 billion over revised target.
All the requirements of productive sectors be it trade, industry or 
agriculture will be fully met within the prescribed limits of the 
credit plan, the Governor of State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Muhammad 
Yaqub said.
Dr Yaqub conceded that inflation was getting out of control and there 
was no way left except enforcing a tight financial discipline which 
has also been accepted by the government.

<a name="rupe">Rupee loses 7 paisa more against $</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 3: The rupee depreciated by another seven paisa against 
the US dollar on Tuesday as the central bank adjusted its parity rate 
in relation to foreign basket of currencies to keep it competitive on 
the world financial markets.
The parity of the rupee was last lowered on September 24. While the 
central bank sources termed the weekly downward readjustment as 
technical corrections, currency dealers say these are creeping 
devaluation of the rupee in a bid to boost exports.
Financial analysts said owing to successive downward revision since 
July 1, the rupee has lost 66 paisa against the dollar and it is a 
big loss for the first quarter of the new year. What is disturbing is 
that the creeping devaluation could not boost export as it should 
have.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee
A NEWS item in Dawn, Monday, September 25, was headed Work on Bagh-e-
Ibne Qasim begins next month. It referred to the development of 
Karachis most prestigious park in Clifton, at a cost of some Rs 33 
million, and ended with the sentence: All allotments, numbering more 
than 64, have been cancelled and structures bulldozed except the site 
of a highrise building owned by a doctor MNA from the interior of 
Sindh.
The doctor MNA is none other than Dr Zulfikar Mirza, elected from 
Badin, and the highrise building, is none other than the infamous 
Costa Livina being built where it should not rise, within the bounds 
of the peoples park.
That same day I went to the High Court of Sindh to hear justice Abdul 
Rahim Kazi pronounce the judgment in the case of the constitutional 
petition filed by the citizens of Karachi against the building of the 
highrise, Costa Livina. The concluding paragraph of the judgment was 
read out by the good judge: "n view of the above discussion, we 
dismiss this petition with no order as to costs. Consequently, other 
miscellaneous applications are also dismissed."
The case having concluded, I am now free to write about it.
I quote from my column of May 3, 1991: "Moving on to the seashore at 
Clifton, plot No. ST-15, Block 3, Scheme 5, designated as a park. Dr 
Zulfikar Mirza, son of Supreme Court Justice Zafar Hussain Mirza, and 
son-in-law of Qazi Abdul Majid Abid, managed, by means devious and 
methods illegal, to have this plot allotted to himself and also 
managed to secure by dubious methods and means, permission to raise a 
14-storey highrise thereon. The allotment as well as the permission to 
build was subsequently cancelled. In the disposal of the appeal order 
cancelling the highrise, it is clearly stated that this plot was 
designated an ST type of plot and was originally intended for the 
construction of a revolving restaurant, similar in nature to the 
London Post Office tower. Now he is trying to persuade Jam to commit 
an illegality once again and to get the park land reallotted to 
himself. So far, the Jam has not bitten."
In my column of May 22, 1992, concerning the adjoining amenity plot, 
ST-14, in the same park, I quoted what the then DG, KDA, Abu Shamim 
Arif, had written on the file in 1991: "The conversion of an amenity 
plot into residential/commercial will certainly be objected to by the 
public as they would be deprived of the facilities of amusement... and 
therefore it would not be desirable to allow such conversion. 
Furthermore, it would create unbearable strain on the already 
precarious water supply situation in the area."
Chief Minister Jam, nevertheless, noted on the file: "Convert. Funfair 
Limited be allowed to convert Plot ST-14... into a unique Commercial 
Site worthy of its location." (Fortunately, the money demanded could 
not be paid, and this site within the park area, to this day, remains 
undisturbed and the allotment stands cancelled).
But, before Jam died, early in 1992, for consideration received, he 
resurrected the 84 Karachi highrises, including Costa livina, that had 
been cancelled in August 1990. Some he revived even whilst lying on 
his deathbed.
In June 1993, Dawn carried the builders advertisement selling Costa 
Livina to the public. The buyers of the shops and flats were promised, 
inter alia, a 24- hour potable water supply through their own 
desalination plants, uninterrupted supply of solar (electric) energy, 
their own gas generated power for air-conditioning  all of which 
implicitly acknowledged the unavailability of water and power. The 
advertisement made no mention of the revolving restaurant.
The plans submitted neither provided spaces for the advertised plants 
and generators, nor an engine room to house the machine for revolving 
the restaurant which the highrise builders claimed they would 
construct above the building. Here was yet another grand scam, duping 
the people, with the controlling authorities knowingly and willingly 
acquiescing.
In July 1993, I again wrote on the subject. Chief Minister Muzaffar 
Hussain Shah had appointed a sub-committee to look into the matter of 
this and other highrises. It was concluded that in the case of plot 
ST-15, Costa Livina: What has been approved is a 15-storey building. 
This is in violation of the original notified scheme and the 
sanctioned layout plan. A highrise building cannot be built in a park, 
which is an amenity and much required open space. The subcommittee 
recommends that the building be not allowed to be built. Only an 
observation tower with a revolving restaurant perched thereon may be 
allowed to be built as originally intended.
However, the weak-kneed Muzaffar could not enforce the decision of his 
own committee and the desecrators pushed ahead. A high officer of the 
KDA, whose travails will have to be covered in a separate column, was 
threatened by Dr Zulfikar. He was told: We are soon coming to power, 
and should you continue your opposition to the building of Costa 
Livina, hum badla lengey. Come to power they did, with a vengence. 
The cronies ganged up and incessantly harassed the upright officer. He 
chose to resign. The baddies will be unhappy to learn that this highly 
qualified man was given a scholarship to do his doctorate in the 
United States, and he is now GONE. Pakistan has lost yet another good 
engineer.
At about the same time, at a friends house I ran into Dr Zulfikar, 
whom I had never met before. Costa Livina, of course, came up. I 
presented the peoples point of view, telling him exactly what I 
thought of him and his gang of land-grabbers. He flared up. I will 
fix you, he said menacingly. Our dialogue ended with my reminding him 
that there was no shortage of his type around, and that I had the 
misfortune of knowing the original fix who now lies possessed of a 
mere six feet by two feet of desert soil.
Costa Livina then started digging. Conferring with my friend, at that 
time as now once more plain citizen Mahmoud Haroon, we along with ten 
others filed a constitutional petition in the High Court. It was heard 
on December 20, 1993, by Justices Imam Ali Kazi and Ahmed Yar Khan. An 
ex-parte interim stay was granted. The parties were later heard and 
the stay was confirmed in 1994 by Justices Mamoon Kazi and Nazim 
Hassain Siddiqui. (People do now indeed miss these two Kazis, and the 
third considerate Kazi, Justice Akhtar Ali).
In September 1995, the petition was heard by Justices Abdul Rahman 
Kazi and Abdul Latif Qureshi. The citizens lawyer, Barrister Mohammed 
Gilbert Naim-ur-Rahman, pleaded in an empty court. The KDA/KMC/KBCA 
and the government lawyers did not even bother to appear. My good old 
friend Ghulam Hussain Abbasi, another former Dingoman, who appeared 
for Dr Zulfikar and family, turned up spasmodically. On one occasion 
he nonchalantly announced to the court that his presence was not 
necessary as Gilbert was reciting the telephone directory. On 
September 25 the petition was dismissed.
Now, whilst in one court the dictates of the environment were being 
disregarded, in another court in the same building they were being 
upheld. On September 20, 1995, the erudite Justice Dr Ghous Mohammed, 
an environmentally friendly judge of the Sindh High Court, presiding 
over yet another highrise case, dismissed the petition filed by the 
highrise builders wanting to build, and wrote in his judgment:
The action of the government in demanding NOCs (no objection 
certificates for utilities and services) could neither be said to be 
unlawful nor unreasonable. It would be pertinent to observe that one 
of the prime duties of every government is to ensure the requisite 
provision of water, sewerage, a pollution-free environment, etc, 
without which any residential project will not only be incomplete but 
will also add to the magnitude of the problems of the residents of any 
area or locality. As such, it will be in the public interest not to 
permit any residential scheme to assume a size and dimension which is 
in flagrant disregard of the availability of utilities. One certainly 
notices that the mushroom growth of highrise buildings in Karachi, 
predominantly motivated by commercial considerations, without being 
equipped with necessary amenities has intensified the ever gowing 
miseries of the urban population.
So, all is not lost. All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is 
that good men do nothing. Can we afford to disagree with Edmund 
Burke?

Some of the economic detriments at the national level and Karachis 
deprivation of new investments by foreign countries, due to continued 
disturbances in the country.
The intention is to draw attention of the intelligentsia to prevailing 
economic situation.
The random list of our economic woes begins and ends thus:
A big shortfall of 20 per cent against the export target has occurred 
during the first two months of the current fiscal year because of 
disturbances in Karachi.
Receipt of the third trench of $300 million from the alienated IMF is 
no where in sight, because the government has reneged on its pledged 
implementation of the structural adjustments suggested by the 
international monetary body. Its end result will be further 
curtailment in the expected availability of foreign exchange to take 
care of imports that are inescapably necessary.
The countrys forex reserve has depleted by $711 million during the 
last two months, as a result of less export earnings, unavoidable 
payments remaining the same.  MOUs worth $22 billion signed by 
prospective foreign investors are nowhere near financial closure.
Out of the only two MOUs signed in Malaysia, one was in respect of a 
palm oil refinery at Port Qasim that falls within the dreaded 
precincts of metropolitan Karachi (the other MoU just held out a vain 
hope of NESPAK of N.C.C. being offered some kind of participation in 
the construction of low-cost houses in Malaysia). As sure as day 
follows night, no foreigner in his senses will rush in when local 
entrepreneurs are closing shop in Karachi and shifting upcountry or 
outside the country.

<a name="leve">Levels of maturity</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
By Mazdak
NEWS of the passage of the Brown Amendment has been met with a 
deafening silence from the opposition, despite its far-reaching 
implications for Pakistan.
Undoing the Pressler Amendment has been a high priority with this 
government, and one pursued with single-minded determination by the 
Prime Minister, our embassy and our lobbyists in Washington. While the 
Brown Amendment has not completely rolled Pressler back, it does 
envisage the release of arms worth 380 million dollars we have already 
paid. 
When an earlier version of the Brown Amendment was filibustered, many 
pundits here and in Washington were convinced that this was the end of 
the matter. In this events, Pakistans lobbying efforts have proved 
remarkably effective, and even this governments critics should find 
it possible to rise above partisan politics and give credit where it 
is due.
The point of this column is not so much to highlight a foreign policy 
triumph as to underline the intensity of the polarisation. Even when 
the government of the day succeeds in doing something that is clearly 
good for the whole nation, the opposition is incapable of rising above 
petty politics and saying a good word about the ruling party. 
Unfortunately, there is simply no tradition of building a bipartisan 
consensus on even the most vital national issues. Every act of 
omission and commission by the ruling party is grist to the 
oppositions propaganda mill. No attempt is ever made by either side 
to overcome their differences for the sake of national unity, at least 
on key areas of Pakistans security. While setbacks are pounced upon 
gleefully, successes are studiously ignored, if not devalued.
By failing to evolve a consensus on anything, and using every issue as 
ammunition in their bitter warfare, both major political groupings 
have ensured that the rest of us do not take politicians seriously.
There is no reason why, given a modicum of goodwill, a degree of 
maturity cannot be injected into the system. All politicians have a 
vested interest in preserving and running democracy. The first thing 
that needs to be done is to agree that whoever wins a general election 
should be allowed to complete his or her term. Easier said than done, 
I know, but this is the essential first step. Rule number two should 
list a number of security-related issues on which there is a national 
consensus, but which are still exploited by politicians for their 
short-term gain. Rule number three has to do with using the power of 
the state to fix political opponents. These strong-arm tactics 
invariably and understandably cause bitterness and poison the 
political atmosphere. In short, we must stop personalising politics to 
the extent that we do.
All this may be a long distance from Washington and the Brown 
Amendment, but there is a lesson to be learnt from the vote in the US 
Senate: the Democratic administration of Bill Clinton was able to 
muster enough support from a majority of Republican senators to ensure 
passage of a controversial bill because it was perceived to be in the 
national interest of the United States. When will our lota legislators 
reach this level of maturity?

<a name="isla">Islamabad diary : The unholy fixation with foreign policy</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir
WHY does the Islamic Republic so woefully lack a sense of proportion 
about the issues which arise in its meandering and erratic path 
towards the light? Why is it swept by a tidal wave of euphoria at the 
slightest success won by its diplomatic arms?
Amidst the frenzied back-slapping and mutual congratulations which 
have erupted after the passage of the Brown amendment in the US 
Senate, these are not irrelevant question to ask. The Brown amendment 
is a modest diplomatic victory. Even though it has still some 
milestones to cross before it bears fruition and even though, when 
fully consummated, it will amount to a one-time waiver which will not 
bring American largesse flowing into the Republics deplete coffers, 
it is a blow to the mischief of the Pressler amendment. But at the 
same time it is not a Himalayan triumph, or a second Congress of 
Vienna, which will make rivers of milk flow towards the parched lands 
of the Republic.
The euphoria over the Brown amendment, however, reflects not merely 
the emotional side of the Pakistani temperament or the natural desire 
of an incompetent government like Ms Bhuttos to derive the maximum 
propaganda benefit from a success that has come its way. It also 
points to a deeper malaise signified by the conviction of the 
Pakistani establishment  something embedded deeply in its 
consciousness  that foreign policy triumphs are substitutes for 
domestic failures.
Pakistan faces many external problems the list of which is known to 
any reasonably educated citizen. It also faces many domestic problems. 
But if a balance sheet was drawn up of the two, it would be clear to 
the meanest intelligence that the complexity of the ills plaguing 
Pakistan from within by far outweigh the subtlety of what it faces 
without.
If the above be accepted it follows that our finest energies should be 
expended in cleaning the stables of our domestic troubles. But that 
has never been the direction of national policy because since the 
birth of Pakistan its decision-makers, a sad lot for the most part, 
have been obsessed with the notion of cutting a figure on the world 
stage and with the desire to buttress the countrys foreign alliances 
while remaining oblivious of the circumstance that Pakistans 
fragility as a nation-state is connected with its internal problems. 
If a quarter of the intelligence, skill and single-mindedness that has 
gone into the conception or making of our foreign policy had gone into 
an appraisal of the home-grown sources of our discontent, the nation 
today would both have been prouder of its past and less hemmed in by 
its present difficulties.
At this point a short recapitulation of past foreign policy triumphs 
is in order. During the fifties when Pakistan sought comfort and 
security within the bosom of CENTO and SEATO, the defence alliances 
which were meant to hold back the advancing tide of world communism, 
it was the favoured recipient of American arms and economic 
assistance.
*From the mid-sixties till the end of the seventies our relations with 
the US deteriorated, this necessitating the search for fresh sources 
of material assistance and psychological support. Thus was laid the 
foundation of our burgeoning relationship with the Peoples Republic 
of China. Then came the eighties, when because of the strife in 
Afghanistan, Pak-US ties recaptured, if only for a brief interregnum, 
their earlier glow. Once the catalyst of Afghanistan lost its 
importance as a focus of American global concerns, our relations with 
the US reverted to the pattern of the seventies when American 
indifference, even if of a benign order, was matched by the feeling in 
the ruling circles of Pakistan that their country had been used and 
then discarded.
The high points of our American connection, during the fifties and 
eighties, no doubt brought many advantages in their wake. Not only did 
our armed forces have an assured source of supply and our economy a 
ballast which brought it easy money. The American connection also 
fulfilled a psychological need by shoring up the confidence of an 
insecure elite. But while all these undoubtedly useful and necessary 
functions were fulfilled, the point to consider is that the 
permissiveness of our ties with the US neither resolved nor even 
mitigated our internal problems. After the high point of the fifties 
we entered into a war with India in 1965 for reasons which were not 
clear then and which appear more bizarre with the passage of time. A 
few years later the country was overwhelmed by a crisis which resulted 
in a military defeat at the hands of India and the amputation of East 
Pakistan. The lessons of these traumatic events are clear. Not only 
that American largesse could not buy Pakistan long-term and lasting 
security. More importantly, the American embrace did not automatically 
guarantee wisdom and vision (the qualities Pakistan has stood most in 
need of) to our rulers and our governing class.
Nor did matters stand much differently after the eighties. The Zia 
regime acquired strength at home and legitimacy abroad when the 
American connection was revived as a result of events in Afghanistan. 
But for all the billions of dollars of military and economic 
assistance which came into Pakistan during that halcyon period, is 
Pakistan a better place to live in today and less beset by problems 
than it was before? If anything, the legacy of that period continues 
to haunt the country. The arms with which the country is awash and the 
growth of the narcotics trade date from Pakistans involvement in 
Afghanistan. It is true that the Soviet intervention left Pakistan 
with little choice except to help the Afghan resistance. But if 
Pakistan had not allowed itself to become such a willing tool in 
American hands it might have pursued options less calculated to harm 
its long-term interests.
There can be no question about it that it would be foolish for 
Pakistan as indeed for any other country to follow a policy of 
needless hostility towards the United States. No interest of Pakistan 
is served by such a self-defeating course. But, at the same time, 
Pakistan needs to liberate itself from that mental frame which leads 
it to think, often mindlessly, that its salvation lies in an over-
weening dependence on a distant power.
Pakistans real problems  those which cast a shadow on its future  
are primarily internal. Among these the most important are the need to 
establish the rule of law and deliver a decent and fair deal to the 
majority of its citizens. The time for national back-slapping will 
truly arrive when these problems (when and how, I have not the 
slightest idea) begin to be addressed.</pre><pre><hr>

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sydney Friskin
BERLIN, Sept 28: Pakistans spirits were revived in the 17th Champions 
Trophy hockey tournament here on Thursday with a hard-earned 2-1 
victory over their traditional rivals, India and are now braced for 
the final game in the round-robin series against Germany on Saturday.
Shahbaz Ahmed regained his touch and scored both goals for Pakistan 
who took the field at full strength with both Tahir Zaman and Mohammad 
Shahbaz in the forward line and Junaid at left half.
While not establishing clear mastery Pakistan deserved their win on 
the grounds of being more imaginative. They earned six penalty corners 
only one of which was converted. India had three of these awards.
The teams had not met since 1991 at Ipoh where, on the way to winning 
the Sultan Azlan Shah Tournament, India had defeated Pakistan 1-0. 
This was altogether the 75th meeting between the two sides and the 
tally now stands at 35 victories to Pakistan, 25 to India with 15 
matches drawn.
By the end of the first half Pakistan, having shown more enterprise, 
were comfortably launched with a 2-0 lead.
Pakistan caused the first thrill of the match as early as the fourth 
minute when Akmal Sikander fought his way into the circle and released 
a rising shot which the Indian goalkeeper Subbaiah saved comfortably.
India retaliated with close passing movements between Dhanraj Pillay 
and Mukesh Kumar but neither player was able to position himself for a 
shot.
A tranquil period was suddenly superseded by a flash of brilliance 
which led to Pakistans first goal. Shahbaz, picking the ball off the 
stick of Harpreet Singh, slipped past the two Indian fullbacks, Anil 
Aldrin and Rajnish Mishra, and released a reverse stick shot that 
landed with great force against the back board having given the 
goalkeeper no chance of saving.
So, in 11 minutes Pakistan were a goal up and seemed to have put 
themselves right with the world. With the Indian defence still 
recovering from the shock Harpreet Singh conceded a penalty corner for 
obstruction. Naveed Alam took a shot but the umpire negatived the 
award for faulty stopping.
Dhanraj Pillay once again struck up a good combination with Mukesh 
Kumar but as before they could not penetrate deep enough. In the 22nd 
minute the second short corner awarded to Pakistan for obstruction led 
to the second goal.
The Indian goalkeeper came out of his charge expecting the shot by 
Naveed to come straight at him. But Junaid cleverly slipped the ball 
to the right of the circle where Shahbaz snapped it up and scored into 
an empty goal.
After Pakistan had squandered a short corner in the 27th minute India 
made progress on the left of the field and Shakeel Ahmad, coming in 
along the line on the left, forced a short corner which came to 
nothing. Just before the half-time whistle a centre from the right by 
Atif Bashir was kicked away by the Indian goalkeeper.
India started the second half in a sensational fashion with a goal 
that brought the game back to life. Dhanraj Pillay, travelling fast on 
the right dispatched a centre into the circle where the ball, which 
rose off a stick, was volleyed into the goal by the outside left Gavin 
Ferreira.
India failed to take advantage of a penalty corner awarded soon after 
and the pace of the game quickened, each side making deep inroads into 
the others defence.
Finally, India lost their last chance of saving the match when Anil 
Aldrin missed the target from a short corner.
It was not a spectacular match but both sides played their hearts out. 
The damp pitch which had absorbed a lot of rain might have accounted 
for the lack of pace.
Teams:    PAKISTAN: Mansoor Ahmad, Naveed Alam, Rana Mujahid, Mohammad 
Usman, Irfan Mahmood, Mohammad Shafqat, Atif Bashir, Tahir Zaman, 
Akmal Sikander, Shahbaz Ahmad (capt), Mohammad Shahbaz.

LAHORE,  Sept  28:  The first  of  the  three  limited-over 
internationals between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played  at the 
newly-laid  pitch  and  re-laid  ground  of  the  Municipal Stadium, 
Gujranwala on Friday.
The Sri Lankans are hot favourites to win the match as  they are one 
of the best fielding sides in the game. This aspect plays very 
important role in a limited-over game. The morale of the Sri Lanka 
team is very high after its resounding victory in the Test rubber 
against Pakistan. Sri Lanka side has been  re-furbished by  the 
inclusion of the specialist  wicketkeeper  Kaluvirathana, fine  all-
rounder  Kalpage and Eric Upashanth.  They  arrived  in Pakistan on 
Monday last to replace the wicketkeeper Dunusighe and two  substitute 
players Jayanth Silva and Samaravera,  who  have been sent back home 
after the Test series.
The  Pakistan team has been strengthened by the  inclusion  of the 
great all-rounder  Wasim Akram,  whose  lethal  bowling  at Peshawar 
had helped the home team register a thumping victory  in the first 
Test by an innings. He had to sit out of the two  Tests which Pakistan 
lost at Faisalabad and Sialkot due to  recurrence of  trouble to his 
functional shoulder.
The  under-prepared  pitch  at Gujranwala may  also  prove  a 
nightmare for  the Pakistani batsmen. The  Pakistan  team also has 
established  stroke-players  like Inzamamul Haq, Wasim Akram, Aamir 
Sohail, Saeed Anwar, Moin  Khan and  Captain Ramiz Raja. 
All in all, a very fine match is the offing. If the World  Cup 
champion, Pakistan team comes out of the shadows of the harrowing 
defeat  in  Test series, it can beat the Sri Lanka team at Gujranwala.

GUJRANWALA, Sept 29: Pakistan registered a facile nine-wicket win over 
Sri Lanka in the three-match international series on Friday at the 
Municipal Stadium here due to an enterprising century for no out on 
his debut by young opener Saleem Elahi.
Set a target of 234 runs for victory, Pakistan coasted home with the 
loss of only one wicket of the other opener Aamir Sohail, who hit a 
fine knock of 77 runs to lay a solid foundation of Pakistan innings. 
Both put on 156 runs on 201 deliveries for the first wicket 
partnership. A strong holiday crowd jampacking the stadium, enjoyed 
the feast of cricket and cheered every good stroke what the speak of 
the centuries by Captain Arjuna Ranatunga and Saleem Elahi.
Helped by very fine batting by Captain Arjuna Ranatunga, who hit an 
attractive knock of 102 not out, and a half-century by Asnka, 
Gurusinha, the Sri Lanka team managed to score 233 in the morning on 
this slow and dead pitch. Both put of 137 runs in 178 balls for the 
fourth wicket partnership.
Pakistan team, demoralised due to loss of Test rubber to Sri Lanka 
only a couple of days ago, did not show any sort of nervousness or 
anxiety and marched on course to victory without much ado. Both the 
openers Aamir Sohail and Saleem Elahi scored 156 runs for the first 
wicket partnership in 201 balls to pave the way of a hands down 
victory. When Aamir Sohail got out, caught by Muralitharan 
(substituting for Ranatunga) in the covers off Jayasuriya for his 
personal score of 77, Pakistan team was on course to win. Aamir Sohail 
played some fine drives, cuts and sweeps in his attractive knock. He 
hit eight elegant boundaries, stayed at the crease for 151 minute and 
played 97 balls. 
Saleem Elahi found another good partner in Captain Ramiz Raja. Both 
added 78 runs on 65 balls for the second wicket stand without being 
separated Ramiz Raja scored 44 runs in 47 minutes, facing 37 balls and 
hitting four boundaries and a huge six over the bowler Dharamasenas 
head.
However, the most belligerent knock of the day was played by the 
debutante Saleem Elahi. Saleem Elahi came out of his crease to hoist 
Wickremasinghe over his head to complete his century. This stroke 
showed his confidence and guts. He played some marvellous strokes. 
Saleem Elahi hit one six and seven boundaries in his marathon stay of 
200 minutes at the crease in which he played 103 balls. Ramiz stroked 
Pushpakumaras delivery for two runs to take his score to 44 and 
Pakistans total to winning figure of 234. It was a win which should 
uplift the sagging morale of the Pakistan team and make the remaining 
two one-dayers at Faisalabad (October 1) Rawalpindi (Oct 3) well-
contested and more absorbing. 
Sri Lanka scored a respectable total of 233 for five in the stipulated 
50 overs after Captain Ramiz Raja won the toss and put the visitors in 
to bat. Captain Arjuna Ranatunga hit a fine, unbeaten century (102) to 
take the Sri Lanka team to a good score at the dead pitch of the 
Municipal Stadium, Gujranwala. His was a responsible knock studded 
with nine boundaries. Arjuna Ranatunga flick the fourth delivery of 
the last over of the innings sent down by Aqib Javed to deep fine leg 
to take two score and complete his century. He hit nine elegant fours. 
He stayed at the crease for 151 minutes and faced 112 balls.
Arjuna Ranatunga and Gurusinha added very fine 137 runs for the fourth 
wicket partnership to strengthen the Sri Lanka innings. Both consumed 
178 balls. The stand was finally broken by spaceman Mohammad Akram, 
making his one-day international debut. He had Asanka Gurusinha hit 
three fours in his stay of 142 minutes at the wicket in which he 
played 104 balls.
Sri Lanka lost its first wicket in the morning at the total of 32. 
Roshan Mahanama (12) was run out by an under-arm direct through from 
Ramiz Raja from the mid on position. The other opener Sanath 
Jayasuriya scored only 25 runs before he was caught at coverpoint by 
Basit Ali off the delivery of spaceman Ataur Rehman. Jayasuriya scored 
25 runs with the help of three fours and a six. He stayed at the 
crease for 46 minutes and played 31 deliveries. The second wicket fell 
at the total of 39. Aravinda de Silva could not also last long. After 
scoring only one run, Aravinda de Silva tried to flick a delivery from 
Ataur Rehman and was caught by Saqlain Mushtaq at deep mid on. Then 
followed the rescure act by Arjuna Ranatunga and Gurusinha.
The wicketkeeper Kaluvitharana could contribute only six runs before 
being run out at the Sri Lankan total of 206 by a direct throw from 
Aamir Sohail. Both Arjuna Rantunga and Hashan Tillekaratn took the 
total to 233 without being separated.
Saleem Elahi, Saqlain Mushtaq and Mohammad Akram made one-day 
international debut in this match. The 12th man was Zahid Fazzal. Sri 
Lanka team brought in Romeish Kaluvitharana, Ruwan Kalpage and 
Pushpakumara. Chaminda Vaas Could not play due to his injury. 
Miralidharan was replaced by Kalpage.

FAISALABAD, Oct 1: Pakistani batting failed once again on the easy-
paced pitch of Iqbal Stadium here and that helped Sri Lanka level the 
3-match one-day international series one-all by dint of a creditable 
49-run victory in the second game on Sunday.
After going down by a wide margin of 144 runs at the Municipal 
Stadium, Gujranwala, only two days ago, the Sri Lanka side learnt from 
its mistakes, braced up its bowling, fielding and batting and handed 
down a defeat to the home team at Faisalabad to come back into the 
series.
The third and decisive match of the series will be played at 
Rawalpindi on Oct 3 (Tuesday). That will also wind up the tour from 
Pearl Islands. Nothing went right for the Pakistan team in this match. 
When Captain Ramiz Raja won the toss and put the Sri Lankan team in to 
bat, the visiting team put up a very good score of 257 for 7 in 50 
overs, mainly due to fine half-centuries by Asanka Gurusinha (66) and 
Sanath Jayasuriya (51). Ataur Rehman and Mohammad Akram took two 
wickets each, conceding 48 and 46 runs respectively. Arshad Khan got 
one wicket for 32 runs. A remarkable stand of 109 runs for the third 
wicket between Gurusinha and Aravinda de Silva brought Sri Lanka in a 
position of strength.
Pakistani batting floundered on this dead pitch once again 
inexplicably. Only young opener Saleem Elahi played a sensible and 
daring knock of 47 before being run out in an unfortunate manner. The 
seasoned batsmen put up a miserable show. Captain Ramiz Raja (33), 
Moin Khan (31), Inzamamul Haq (14) and Basit Ali (19) fell to bad 
strokes after being well-set.
The Pakistani innings was off to a disastrous start on Sunday. In the 
second over, Aamir Sohail (9 with 2 fours) mistimed a delivery from 
paceman Chaminda Vaas and was well-caught by Muralitharan at point.
Saleem Elahi and Ramiz Raja batted with commensurate ease and added 79 
runs on 107 deliveries. That was the only happy period of the 
Pakistani batting. After hitting a confident knock of 47, Saleem Elahi 
run out while stealing the second run. He dived full length and even 
reached the crease but since his bat was in the air, the TV umpire 
Taufique Khan ruled him run out. The second wicket fell at 89. 
Thereafter Pakistan team crashed to 208 for 8 in the stipulated 50 
overs. 
Ramiz Raja was batting well at his personal score of 33, when he was 
brilliantly caught by Jayasuriya at deep mid-wicket off Dharamasena. 
The fielder, with his eyes on the ball, ran forward and then side-ways 
to hold a good diving catch. Ramiz hit three fours in his stay of 80 
minutes at the wicket in which he faced 50 balls. The third wicket 
fell at the total of 92.
At the total of 116, Inzamamul Haq was caught at long on by Gurusinha 
off Jayasuriya. He struggled for 38 minutes for his 14 runs and did 
not look in his elements.
Promoted in the batting order, Moin Khan started off in his usual 
style and scored good 31 runs. He was caught by Kalpage, substituting 
for Mahanama, at the long on boundary off the delivery of Muralitharan 
while trying a big hit. He played 41 balls in his stay of 62 minutes 
at the wicket in which he hit two boundaries.
Basit Ali played the most insipid knock of his career. He scored 16 
laborious runs before being bowled by Jayasuriya while attempting to 
sweep the delivery of the left-hander. After his dismissal the hopes 
of a Pakistani win vanished. Aamir Hanif (19 with one four) and Aqib 
Javed (21 with one boundary) were bowled by Aravinda de Silva in the 
last overs. Pakistan team fell to ignominious defeat by 41 runs.
Sri Lanka side hit a reasonably good score of 257 for seven in the 
stipulated 50 overs in the morning session. Captain Ramiz Raja won the 
toss and put the visiting team in to bat on an easy-paced pitch. 
Asanka Gurusinha (66) and the opener Sanath Jayasuriya (51) hit fast 
half-centuries to help Sri Lanka put up a good score. Aravinda de 
Silva (47) and opener Roshan Mahanama (30) chipped in with some useful 
knocks to contribute handsomely to their teams total.
Asanka Gurusinha and Aravinda de Silva were involved in the best 
partnership of the best partnership of the innings. Both added 109 
runs for the third wicket stand on 106 deliveries. While attempting to 
lift off-spinner Arshad Khan over his head, Gurusinha was beaten by 
the delivery and smartly stumped by wicketkeeper Moin Khan. That was 
the only wicket claimed by Arshad Khan who broke the stubborn 
partnership. When Gurusinha scored 54 runs, he completed his three 
thousand runs in one-day international matches.
Both the openers Roshan Mahanama and Sanath Jayasuriya laid a good 
foundation of the Sri Lanka innings by scoring 75 runs for the first 
wicket partnership. Captain Ramiz Raja dropped Jayasuriya at mid on 
when the opener had scored only ten runs. He put both hands to the 
ball but could not hold on to it.
It was a sad miss and the bowler who suffered was paceman Mohammad 
Akram. Jayasuriya played some elegant shots after that. The first 
wicket partnership was broken by paceman Ataur Rehman. The other 
opener Mahanama missed a ball from Ataur Rehman, was hit on the 
backfoot and umpire Mohammad Siddique Khan raised his finger without 
any hesitation.
Gurusinha and Jayasuriya took the Sri Lankan total to 100 when the 
latter was caught by Aqib Javed of Ataur Rehman at the deep third-man 
position. Jayasuriya went for a big hit, but the ball ballooned from 
the top edge of his bat and Aqib held a well-judged catch. Jayasuriya 
hit some attractive strokes. His drives, cuts and pulls were enjoyed 
by a good crowd of over ten thousand. Jayasuriya stayed at the crease 
for 109 minutes, played 72 balls and hit four boundaries.
Gurusinha and Arvinda de Silva were involved in very productive 
partnership for the third wicket. Both were not afraid on hitting 
their shots. Had the partnership prolonged, the Sri Lankan side would 
have hit a huge total on this wicket. Gurusinha, on reaching 54, 
completed 3000 score in one-day international matches. It was his 
112th match.
Gurusinha hit the finest knock for Sri Lanka. His 66 runs included a 
huge six and five elegant boundaries. The highest individual score 
among the visitors was hit on 73 balls and in 99 minutes.
Arvinda de Silva also batted with confidence and scored 47 runs At the 
Sri Lankan total of 222, Arvinda de Silva was brilliantly run out by 
burly Inzamamul Haq. The fielder dived full length to stop a hit and 
threw the stumps with a direct throw while lying on the ground with 
Arvinda failing to reach his crease. The TV umpire Taufique Khan ruled 
him out. Arvinda hit four fours, played for 84 minutes and faced 54 
deliveries.
Three quick wickets fell in the last stages of the innings which 
dropped down the run-rate. Captain Arjuna Ranatunga could not bat well 
in this innings. At the total of 232, Arjuna Ranatunga was clean 
bowled by Muhammad Akram. He went back to play an incoming delivery 
and was bowled through the gates. Ranatunga contributed only 15 runs.
Romesh Kalwvirathana and Tillekaratne were throwing their bats at 
every delivery in the last overs. After scoring only eleven runs, 
Kaluwirathana was run out by an amazing direct throw by Ataur Rehman 
*from  long on boundary. The sixth wicket fell as 256. At the same 
score, Hashan Tillekeratna was bowled by Mohammad Akram in the last 
over of the innings. Kumara Dharamasena remained not out at one and at 
the conclusion of the Sri Lankan innings the team had scored 257. Only 
one change was made in the Pakistan team. Off-spinner Arshad Khan 
replaced the injured Saqlain Mushtaq. Two changes were made in the Sri 
Lanka side. Kalpage was replaced by Muttiah Muralidharan while 
Chaminda Vass came in place of Pushpakumara.

BERLIN, Oct 1: Pakistan put aside their injury worries and left the 
17th Champions Trophy hockey tournament with the bronze medal in their 
possession after a 2-1 victory over Holland in the play-off.
It was sweet revenge for Pakistan who were beaten 2-0 by the Dutch in 
the round-robin series and they fought tooth and nail to achieve it. 
Early in the second half he came into violent collision with the Dutch 
defender Sander van Heeswick and retired to the sideline for 
attention. Judged by the anguish shown by Shahbaz a couple of teeth 
might have been damaged but he soon came back into the fray.
Pakistan took the field without Tahir Zaman bringing on Mohammad 
Nadeem as a substitute. Not only did he fit well into the forward line 
but he also scored the winning goal. Danish Kaleem lined up at full 
back for his first game of the tournament.
The match itself got away to a sensational start with Holland scoring 
in the second minute. Their outside left Remco van Wijk came in 
sharply and scooped the ball over Mansoor Ahmads head into the goal. 
He probably thought that this was the only way to beat him.
There followed a long period of even play in which Pakistan came into 
the circle a couple of times but were denied shots at goal. However, 
Pakistans frustration ended in the 31st minute when Naveed Alam 
converted a penalty corner with a beautiful shot along the ground for 
his third goal of the tournament.
The second half started on a quiet note but there was a green card for 
the Dutch goalkeeper Ronald Jansen for dissent. When the dust settled, 
a rather casual free hit from the left of the circle by Nadeem went 
astray.
The physical aspect of the game then began to show with the first 
collision between van Heeswijk and Junaid. Play restarted with a free 
hit from Junaid to Shahbaz who was immediately surrounded by four 
Dutch players who barred his way to goal.
Shahbaz, after his collision with van Heeswijk, left the field in the 
18th minute of this period but oddly enough, although he was shaken he 
spurred Pakistan onto greater endeavour. Atif Bashir, at outside 
right, who had earlier hit the outside netting after a brilliant run, 
came more into promise.
Then Shahbaz delivered the vital blow. Noticing a space on the right 
of the field he gave the ball to Nadeem who raced unopposed into the 
circle and released a shot which landed in the goal after Jansen had 
made a futile attempt to save. The shot went clearly out of reach.
Shortly after he had scored, Nadeem was put under temporary suspension 
for hitting the ball away after the whistle was blown at the end of an 
abortive short corner for Pakistan. Nevertheless Pakistan continued to 
lay siege to the Dutch goal and a penalty corner was earned after a 
sparkling run by Mohammad Shahbaz. Naveeds shot, however, was well 
saved by the Dutch goalkeeper.
Ten minutes before the end the Dutch created a chance for the 
equaliser which they so desperately sought. Maurits Crucq came up from 
the back and eluding both full backs tried a shot which Mansoor saved 
somewhat contortedly. Play was held up soon after as another collision 
caused an injury to Irfan and it took several minutes to revive him.
Holland, however, kept up the chase and with barely five minutes to 
go, were rewarded with a penalty corner. Taco van den Honert, not 
given to missing the target, put his shot wide and Pakistan breathed 
again. At the other end Shahbaz crowned a good afternoons work by 
setting up a chance for Mohammad Shahbaz whose shot went high and 
wide. That was virtually the end of the match.
PAKISTAN: Mansoor Ahmad, Naveed Alam, Danesh Kaleem, Mohammad Usman,

Samiul Hasan
RAWALPINDI, Oct 2: Pakistan take on Sri Lanka in the third and 
decisive one-day international here on Tuesday with the series and 
reputation both at stake.
Having won the Gujranwala one-dayer so comfortably by nine wickets 
with 36 balls to spare, Pakistan were brought down to earth with a 
bang. As far as the reputation is concerned, since winning the World 
Cup in Melbourne on March 25, 1992, Pakistan has not been able to 
justify themselves as the true champions.
Pakistan won the five-match series against New Zealand 4-1 and 
registered victory by an identical margin over Sri Lanka before 
everything started going wrong for them.
They failed to win a single game in the quadrangular tournament in Sri 
Lanka and then were comprehensive beaten in the Wills Triangular 
Series by Australia. They were then swept aside by South Africa in the 
Mandela Trophy and even failed to beat Zimbabwe when they were held to 
a 1-1 draw.
As far as this series is concerned, Sri Lanka has definitely appeared 
to be more superior and improved side. They are better fit both 
mentally and physically.
On the contrary, Pakistan has not recovered from the betting and 
bribery scandals. Their problems compounded further when Javed 
Miandad, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis had to be left out because on 
fitness grounds.
When the two teams take the field on Tuesday for the final game of the 
series. Sri Lanka will be enjoying a cutting edge over Pakistan 
because of two simple reasons: 1. they came from 1-0 down to win the 
Test series 2-1; 2. they once again pulled themselves in the one-day 
series and are now level at 1-1.
The two teams have not finalised their teams for the decider Arjuna 
Ranatunga, the Sri Lankan skipper, stated that the batting lineup will 
not be changed but hinted that a couple of changes might be made in 
the bowling. The wicket it seems will suit the seamers. Therefore, we 
might play with three pacers. However, we will take a final decision 
on Tuesday morning.
Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja said: Saqlain Mushtaq will be joining the 
team and most likely we shall be playing with two spinners and two 
fast bowlers.
Commenting on tomorrows match, Ranatunga said: We are not complacent 
after 2-1 Test series. We want to win the one-day series as well. 
Ranatunga admitted that his team enjoyed the edge in the final match 
of the series but added that any team giving its best will win the 
match and the series.
Raja, asked why he played with four seamers at Sialkot, Raja said the 
major reasons for that was that Pakistans strength laid in fast 
bowlers Secondly, Saqlain no doubt was a good spinner but lacked 
experience and thus could not run through the innings.
Reverting to the decisive one-dayer, while the match would be 
significant as far as the series is concerned, a couple of individual 
landmarks are also expected to be achieved here.
Ramiz Raja is only eight runs short of becoming the third Pakistani 
and 11th in the world to accumulated 5,000 runs while Inzamamul Haq 
needs four runs to complete 3,000 runs and become fifth Pakistani 
after Javed Miandad, Salim Malik, Ramiz Raja and Imran Khan.
All said and done, a very interesting battle between the bat and the 
ball is on the cards on Tuesday. Though odds are against Pakistan, the 
home team has never lost its previous four matches on this ground. 
They won against Sri Lanka in 1991-92, beat Zimbabwe in 1993-94 and 
won successive matches against Australia and South Africa last year in 
the triangular series.

RAWALPINDI, Oct 3: Sri Lankas spin bowlers excelled again on Tuesday, 
restricting Pakistan to 183 for nine in the third and final one-day 
cricket international.
The match was reduced to 38 overs-a-side after heavy overnight rain 
left the ground waterlogged.
Kumara Dharmasena claimed three for 30 while Aravinda de Silva, better 
known for his aggressive batting, captured three for 36.

RAWALPINDI,  Oct 3: Pakistans reputation as world  champions received 
another  severe blow when Sri  Lanka, defeated  them  by  four wickets 
in the third and decisive one-day international  at  the Pindi Cricket 
Stadium here on Tuesday.
Having lost the opener at Gujranwala by a huge margin of nine wickets, 
Sri  Lanka levelled the series 1-all  at  Faisalabad where they won by 
49 runs and clinched the double at  Rawalpindi. Like  the  Test 
series, it was their  first-ever  one-day  series triumph in Pakistan.
The  Islanders  had  earlier  won  the  Test  series  by   an 
indentical  margin,  more or less in similar  fashion  when  they 
staged  a magnificent recovery after losing the Peshawar Test  by an 
 innings  to draw the series level at  Faisalabad  where  they triumph 
 by  42 runs. In Sialkot, they won by 144 runs.
In a game of fluctuating fortunes in which none of the  sides 
completely dominated the proceedings, Pakistan had a good  chance of 
 salvaging some pride when they had reduced Sri Lanka  to  165 for six 
*from  138 for three when the visitors were chasing 184 for victory in a 
reduced 38-over-a-side game.
But  like the national hockey team, the cricket  team  lacked final 
touches and failed to convert a close game into victory.
Although  Aqib Javed did evoke a ray of hope in the  packed-to-
capacity  stands when he bowled three successive  maiden balls  in the 
final over when Sri Lanka needed two  for  victory. But  a bad throw 
by Salim Elahi at the non-strikers end  to  run out Hashan 
Tillekeratke not only missed the three sticks but also conceded  two 
extra runs as no fielder was there to  back up  the throw.
Ramiz,  in  this match only, committed at least  two  crucial 
mistakes. Firstly, he did not inducted Aamir Sohail, the left-arm 
spinner,  in  the  attack considering that Arshad  Khan  had  got 
support  from the track as is evident from his figures  of  7-1-26-0 
and  secondly, Sri Lanka wicketkeeper Rumesh  Kaluwitharna,  from the 
word go, played his shots around the square-leg  region  but the 
Pakistan skipper did not strengthen that area. And  when  an 
additional fielder in Inzamamul Haq was brought in,  Kaluwitharna 
played  a lofted shot at square-leg to be caught by  Saeed  Azad. But 
by then it had been too late as the wicketkeeper had  already caused 
the damage by scoring 12 invaluable runs from 10 balls.
Reverting  to the match, Sri Lanka did everything  right  and the 
Pakistanis did everything wrong. The  Sri Lankan slow bowlers were 
right on target  while  the Pakistanis,  barring Arshad Khan, were 
erratic. The  fielding  of the two sides was as much different as 
their attitude towards the game.
Sri  Lanka, chasing 184 to win in 38 overs with an average  of 4.82 
runs per over, started off well when Sanath Jayasuriya  (19) and 
Roshan Mahanama (23) put on 42 runs for the opening wicket in 8.1 
overs.
However, Sri Lanka were reduced to 63 for three in 14.2 overs when 
Zafar Iqbal, playing his second game, achieved  success  in quick 
successions  getting  rid of  Asanka  Gurusinha  (10)  and Mahanama 
after Aqib Javed sent Jayasuriya back to the pavilion to start the 
rot.
Nevertheless,  experienced campaigners in Aravinda  de  Silva and 
Arjuna Ranatunga held the innings together and repaired  the damage by 
putting on 75 runs an equal number of minutes to put the tourists back 
in game.
But  successive  decisions against the two off  Aamir  Hanif, which 
could have gone in their way, changed the complexion of the match.
Aravinda  de Silva was declared leg before after scoring 32 runs from 
53 balls with the aid of two boundaries and 11 balls later Arjuna 
anatunga, named Man-of-the-Match, fell in a similar fashion  to  the 
same bowler after scoring a 83-ball 42 that included three hits to the 
fence.
Aamir  Hanif then secured his final wicket of the match  when he 
accounted for Rumesh Kaluwitharna to reduce Sri Lanka to  165 for six 
with another 19 needed of the final 21 balls.
However,  Hashan  Tillekeratne,  later  adjudged  Man-of-the-Series, 
and  Rawan Kalpage made sure that  their  team  overtook Pakistans 
score without any further damage though Kalpage must have stopped the 
heart beats of his team-members by  playing three  maiden balls in the 
final over when two runs  were  needed for a historic victory.
For  Pakistan,  Aamir Hanif, playing his  third  one-day  for 
Pakistan,  was the most successful bowler with three wickets  for 36 
 runs  while Zafar Iqbal, appearing for the  second  time  for 
Pakistan  since the Asia Cup, chipped in with two wickets for  37 
runs.
Sri  Lanka scored their first 50 from 10.3 overs while  their second 
50 came off 13.1 overs. They reached 150 off 32.3 overs.
Earlier,  Pakistan, put into bat, managed to collect 183  for nine in 
their allotted 38 overs, thanks to a fine unbeaten  knock of 36 by 
Aamir Hanif off 44 balls with the aid of two boundaries.
Aamir  had  held the innings together when the  top  Pakistan batsmen 
had departed after playing some careless shots and  left the team to 
struggle at 104 for four in 24.1 overs.
Pakistani  batsmen  failed to cash in on the  opportunity  of posting 
a  big  score after Aamir Sohail  and  Salim  Elahi  had provided  the 
home team with a second half century stand  of  the series.
Salim Elahi, who scored 30 off 33 balls with three fours  and a six, 
hit the ball right into the hands of Rawan Kalpage at deep mid-wicket 
off Kumara Dharamasena while trying to hit  the  ball out of the 
ground.
Aamir  Sohail (26 off 55 balls with two boundaries) Ramiz Raja  (4) 
danced  down  the wicket  only  to  be  mesmerised  by Dharamasena and 
wicketkeeper Kaluwitharna making no mistakes in removing the bails.
Inzamamul Haq, who became the fifth Pakistani and 35th in the world to 
get 3,000 when he got his fourth run in his knock of 25, repeated the 
Faisalabad mistake and was caught by Jayasuriya at the boundary off 
Aravinda de Silva.
Saeed Azad, started  off  well but then awarded  one  of  the simplest 
of  catches to Pramodiya Wickremasinghe at  mid-off  to throw  away 
his  wicket after scoring 19 off  35  balls  with  a boundary.
After  removing the top order, the rest became easy for  the tourists 
who restricted Pakistan to 183 for nine in 38 overs.
Kumara  Dharamasena finished with three wickets for  30  runs while 
Aravinda  de Silav bettered his best  bowling  figures  to three 
wickets for 30 runs.
Pakistans  50  came off 11.2 overs while  they  reached  the three 
figures from 22.4 overs. They completed their 150 from  33 overs.

<a name="imra">IMRAN KHAN SAYS : Salim case confusion should be c1eared</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

QUETTA, Sept 30: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan, in an exclusive 
interview to Dawn here on Saturday said, total confusion prevails in 
the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in regard to the Salim Malik case. 
"It is high time, the confusion is cleared and the house put in order.  
We are fast approaching two highly important assignments, the tour 
Down Under and the World Cup which we will defend at home in February-
March next year. A strong squad will have to be selected for the very 
difficult task at hand.  
"Pakistan will have to name a team that would comprise a rich blend of 
youth and experience. In the event, both Salim Malik and Ejaz Ahmed 
will be the backbone of the side," opined Imran Khan.  
"To begin Seth, the PCB should make it absolutely clear, if Salim 
Malik was involved in trying to sell the Pakistan team by offering 
bribes to throw the Karachi Test match as alleged by Australian stars 
Shane Warne and Tim May,".
"If Salim Malik was really involved, which I doubt he could have done 
it all by himself without any other member of the team. being equally 
responsible, then the PCB is morally bound to start criminal 
proceedings against him in a court of law.  
"If at all Salim Malik is found guilty he should be banned for life 
but if no, he should be allowed to resume his career with the Pakistan 
team. But the Ad hoc arrangement of appointing former Supreme Court 
Justice Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim, as an inquiry officer is just not good 
enough,".  
"Then, come to the case of the exclusion of Ejaz Ahmed, he was the 
second highest on the batting averages in- the last tour of South 
Africa and Zimbabwe. Why is he being punished, I just cannot 
understand. Is it because he is the brother-in-law of  Salim Malik?" 
inquired an agitated Imran Khan. In fairness, Ejaz Ahmed, really 
deserved to be in the team and Pakistan could well do with his 
experience. 
"I am as confused as you with the way the PCB has been handling the 
Salim-Ejaz problem, so to speak," asked to comment on the just 
concluded home Test series defeat against lowly-rated Sri Lanka Imran 
Khan brushed aside the topic by stating he had not seen a single day's 
play.  
When his attention was drawn to the tracks prepared for the Lankan 
series, he shot back: "This is a 19 year-old problem and no Board 
whatsoever has saver addressed the subject to find a corrective 
solution," said the former Pakistan fast bowler.  
"It all boils down to the corruption in the domestic cricket format. 
The powers-that-be are fully aware the gambling had begun in the 
domestic cricket matches with the various departments playing fix 
matches stated Imran Khan.  
"Until and unless we base our domestic cricket structure on regional 
basis as is done in all the other Test cricket-playing countries, the 
present malady and ill in our cricket will continue," opined the great 
Imran Khan.  
"I like to let you know, that I am one Pakistani who has had the 
longest experience in the international cricket circuit and has 
virtually delivered the goods in every respect, yet the PCB has 
excluded me from having a say in the country's administration and the 
hardly adhere to my views," informed a despondent Pakistan cricketing 
hero.  
"They have just sidelined me, and that is that. Do I not deserve 
better and be allowed to contribute my bit," Imran Khan, the former 
Pakistan all-rounder, wanted to know. </pre><hr>
