<a name="khan">Khan invites MQM to talks</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 Law Minister N.D. Khan, who is also leading the 
government side at the peace talks with MQM, has asked the MQM 
leadership to resume the stalled talks before he leaves for a 10-day 
foreign tour.
He said Mr Dehlavi had written an 11-page letter to him raising new 
issues and making new demands to resume talks. We are ready to even 
discuss these new issues at the talks. 
The minister said the resumption of talks was necessary to give 
confidence and a new hope for peace to the people who are facing 
terrorism in Karachi. I will like to repeat my offer, let s have 
talks, he said. For the sake of peace and normality we must meet. 
When pointed put that Mr Delhavi had demanded an end to the siege of 
MQM localities by para-military forces as a pre-condition for resuming 
talks, he said if the MQM team returns to the talks, this issue can 
also be discussed.
He regretted that MQM was resorting to strikes and thus causing damage 
to the national economy. Political issues, he said, must be resolved 
through political means. 
The minister said a political settlement of the issue could be 
achieved within a week provided the MQM stops terrorism. He said if 
peace could be maintained in Karachi for only three months, we can 
hold local bodies elections in that city.
The MQM has majority in Karachi and in case of local bodies elections 
their members are likely to be elected in Karachi Metropolitan 
Corporation so peace will only help them, he maintained.

<a name="pppr">PPP replies to MQM points</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 12 Continuing his rebuttal to the MQM reply, the PPP 
spokesman has challenged the claim that there are no gang leaders in 
the MQM, so there is no question of handing anyone to the government.
When the government made such a demand, the MQM denied that the 
government demand had any truth, and it made a counter- allegation 
that there was a government-Al-Zulfikar axis. The allegation was 
promptly denied by the government.
The spokesman claimed that the manner in which Farooq Dada and others 
were owned by the MQM was a clear indication that it had gang leaders 
within its ranks, who were allegedly involved in terrorism in the 
city.
The PPP spokesman alleged that Farooq Dada had been killed with three 
 terrorists who were gang leaders of their respective areas. Each 
gang leader, with the help of several youths, collected bhatta for 
his gang and some for the self-exiled founder of the MQM, the PPP 
spokesman alleged.
Striking at the contradictions in the stand of the MQM leadership, the 
PPP spokesman said that the evening when Farooq Dada was killed on Aug 
2, the deputy opposition leader in the Sindh Assembly and member of 
the MQM negotiating team, with Kazi Khalid and Shaikh Liaquat Hussain, 
had told newsmen that Farooq Dada had nothing to do with the MQM (A) 
and that he had been expelled a year ago because of his alleged 
criminal activities.
But at 10 in the night of Aug 2 a fax message from London was received 
in newspaper offices in which Mr Altaf Hussain had described Farooq 
Patni as a martyr .
Soon after this fax message, Shoaib Bokhari and other MQM(A) leaders 
started pleading with the newspapers to mention Farooq Dada as an MQM 
worker.
The PPP spokesman contended that if Altaf Hussain had not supported 
the gang leader and notorious terrorist Farooq Dada, all other 
gang leaders would have gone out of his control.
The PPP spokesman also denied MQM allegations that his party had any 
links with Al Zulfikar.
Demanding that the Altaf Group should furnish the exact number of 
people who had sought refuge in various countries the PPP spokesman 
maintained that even if the claim of the MQM (A) was accepted, then 
one would like to know who provided finance to so many people because 
only travel expenses for about 20,000 people would be around one 
billion rupees.
He contended that the weapons which filtered down to the MQM ranks in 
Karachi was not beneficial for the country. He added that all acts of 
the MQM (A) were detrimental to Pakistan s interest and was being 
exploited by India.
He said the special relationship of Javed Langra with top Indian 
leaders, including the interior minister, needed to be explained.
Emphasising the need for peace in the city, the PPP spokesman urged 
Altaf Hussain to renounce terrorism and cooperate with Pakistan.

LONDON, Oct 12 The United Nations Secretary-General has been informed 
of the latest killings of MQM workers in Karachi, some of whom were 
 in judicial custody and were brought under police escort to a place 
where they were shot dead .
Mr Hussain in his letter adds that attempts to reason with the 
authorities in Pakistan, including the President and the army chief, 
have been in vain, thus far. The UN secretary general had been 
requested to circulate the petition from the MQM to the Security 
Council members and to use his own position to alleviate the present 
suffering of the Mohajirs, and initiate a move in defence of 
international law.
Copies of the letter to the UN secretary general have, as before, been 
sent to the President and the army chief in Pakistan, the Supreme 
Court and high courts as well to world leaders and human rights 
organisations.

<a name="kill">Killing of workers Altaf wants case registered</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Oct 13 MQM chief Altaf Hussain has asked the President to 
order the registration of a murder case against those responsible for 
the killing of three MQM workers who had been in judicial custody 
since Aug 6.
In a statement issued here, Mr Hussain said all three of them were 
brought to Nazimabad on Oct 10 on the pretext of providing 
identification. They were killed when they were under police escort 
and were handcuffed and had their feet in fetters.
The hospital report shows that they were shot at from a close range. 
There was a fourth body also found and this was described by the 
police to be that of another victim of the same ambush that killed the 
other three.
Mr Hussain said that the interior minister said on the same day that 
the three MQM workers Faheem, Zeeshan and Yousuf were killed due 
to sniper fire and one of the attackers died because of police firing.
He also admitted that Khurshid Anwar and two of his sisters had been 
arrested on suspicion of supplying arms to the attackers.
The MQM had issued a call for the release of the women of Khurshid 
Anwar s family. The mother and one sister of the deceased on Friday 
turned up at the MQM headquarters claiming that they were never 
arrested and that Khurshid Anwar was still in custody, having been 
arrested from his house on the morning of Oct 10. Mr Hussain said that 
this statement seems to have been made under police duress.
Mr Hussain has said that he held the prime minister, the interior 
minister and others responsible for the killings of the MQM workers.
If the President did not proceed against them in four days, he said, 
the MQM would launch an appropriate protest, details of which would be 
announced later.

<a name="want">Altaf wants to harm country, says Shah</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
KARACHI, Oct 13 Sindh Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah said here on 
Friday, there was mini insurgency and foreign interference in 
Karachi and charged that MQM leader Altaf Hussain wanted to cause harm 
to the progress and dignity of Pakistan.
Syed Abdulah Shah said that MQM in the initial stages had wanted a 
separate province carved out of Sindh and then go for unilateral 
declaration for independence and have a separate country. 
This kind of programme suits the enemies of Pakistan and that is why 
they (MQM) get covert and overt support from India and the Zionist 
lobby who can never tolerate the emergence of any strong Muslim state.
 We have evidence that foreign-trained terrorists are in Karachi and 
are still coming. The influx of illegal arms to this province from 
various sources and modern communication system prove our contentions 
that there is foreign interference, he maintained.
He said the situation was now changing in a manner that the law 
enforcement agencies were having an upper hand and the terrorists were 
on the run. 
 The rocket attack at new Sindh Secretariat building a few days back 
was aimed at damaging the image of the law enforcement agencies. It 
was a high profile case to create fear among the people of Karachi. 
The chief minister said that clearing the minds of the people of 
Pakistan vis-a-vis the MQM was one achievement of our government. He 
said any terrorist having a criminal record was owned by the MQM after 
he was killed. Their frequent calls for strike for no reason were 
meant to damage the economy of the country. 
He said his (Altaf Hussain s) letters to the international 
organisations and staging of demonstrations against the prime minister 
only point to one thing he (Altaf Hussain) wants to cause harm to the 
progress and dignity of Pakistan and was helping India in its actions 
in Kashmir.
Asked whether the government would continue talks with the MQM in such 
a situation the chief minister replied We have to have negotiations 
with the MQM as the party has representation in the Senate and the 
Sindh Assembly. People of Karachi voted for them but they did not keep 
the mandate of their electorates in the assembly. They boycotted Sindh 
Assembly session. If they did not want to go to the assembly why did 
they get elected, he asked.
He said that by having talks with the MQM, the government wanted to 
show its sincerity for solving all political problems. The only 
condition of the MQM was release of all their criminals and giving 
them a free hand. We will not permit this .
He admitted that in a few cases law enforcement agencies had committed 
excesses, and added that the government had taken strict action 
against policemen. In a situation like this, I do not deny excesses 
as these are compulsions of the situation. I feel uncomfortable on 
excesses by police, and go for judicial enquiry. Even on false 
allegations of the MQM we have held judicial enquiry to restore 
confidence of the people, he added.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 13 The MQM was bitterly criticised for its alleged links 
with India after New Delhi s representative at the United Nations on 
Thursday referred to the situation in Karachi and cited Altaf 
Hussain s letter to the Secretary-General in this regard.
In a joint statement, provincial ministers Nisar Ahmed Khuro and Abdul 
Hakim Baloch, and adviser on information Mohammad Yousuf castigated 
India for interfering in the internal affairs of Pakistan and asked 
Altaf Hussain not to play in the hands of India .
The ministers alleged that Altaf Hussain had gone too far and ignored 
Pakistan s vital interests just to satisfy his personal interests .
It does not auger well for Pakistan and no patriotic person would 
tolerate that anyone collaborates with the enemies of Pakistan, said 
the ministers.
They alleged that on the one hand Altaf Hussain and Mian Nawaz Sharif 
were conspiring against the democratic system in the country while, 
on the other, they were joining hands with India. 
As the leader of the opposition, it was the responsibility of Mian 
Nawaz Sharif to dissuade Altaf Hussain to leave the suicidal path of 
friendship and collaboration with India , said the provincial 
ministers.

<a name="dehl">Dehlavi blames govt for present situation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 13 The Chief MQM negotiator Ajmal Dehlavi said on Friday 
 we must put our house in order so that the opponents of Pakistan do 
not get any chance to take advantage of it and embarrass us . 
He was commenting on the criticism by some provincial ministers of the 
Indian delegate s reference to the Karachi situation at the UN, and 
Altaf Hussain s letter to the world body s Secretary General.
He was of the view that the government was to blame for the present 
situation because it was not stopping what he called extra-judicial 
killings and massive and indiscriminate arrests of the Mohajirs.
This situation, Mr Dehlavi said , was creating difficulties in the 
negotiations and providing reasons for strikes. He contended if the 
alleged State terrorism was stopped, the cause for strikes would not 
be there.
The chief MQM negotiator recalled that when the talks had commenced, 
his party had called off the strike and jointly condemned terrorism. 
But he alleged State terrorism continued unabated and more and more 
people were executed in police custody in a questionable manner, 
providing a pretext for a strike.
Replying to a question, he confirmed that members of the MQM 
negotiating team would visit London for instructions from Altaf 
Hussain. The purpose of this visit would also be to inform Mr Hussain 
about the various aspects of negotiations and the general situation 
prevailing at home.

has to stop, said Altaf Hussain.
Mr Hussain called for the immediate release of four women, three 
sisters and a mother of the MQM worker Khurshid Anwar, who was killed 
while in police custody on the morning of October 10.
He added that the pattern of taking physical custody of the women 
relatives of MQM workers, or of entire families of such people 
emphasised that the Bhutto government is embarked upon this course of 
action with a view to shatter the dignity, self-respect and personal 
identity of the Mohajir nation .
He warned the authorities of an internal war if they do not desist 
>from  their designs. He said no self-respecting people can allow such 
state inflicted brutality to go unchecked.
He also reminded that the whereabouts of Rais Fatima have not been 
disclosed after her disappearance in June and Shazia Farooq, the wife 
of an MQM worker, is under detention since August 2.
He added that if the four women arrested recently were not released

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 14 In less than a week the MQM has called for another 
day of protest on Wednesday against the alleged custodial murder of 
Mufeez Farooqi, elder brother of Fahim Commando, who was also killed 
in a mysterious ambush on Oct 10.
The protest precedes the countrywide black day being observed by the 
opposition on Oct 19. The MQM leader has asked the people of Sindh to 
close their business and abstain from work on Wednesday (Oct 18).
After much confusion about the identity of the fourth person killed in 
the encounter in which Fahim Commando was slain, the MQM claimed that 
it was Mufeez Farooqi, 26, Fahim s elder brother.
According to the MQM chief, Mufeez Farooqi was arrested by the police 
on Oct 6 in Rawalpindi and was allegedly brought to Karachi.
MQM sources had first contended that the unidentified body was that of 
Altaf Qureshi but then said it was Khursheed Anwar s as identified by 
Shaikh Liaquat and others at the Edhi centre. But on Saturday, the MQM 
chief Altaf Husain claimed that it was the body of the brother of 
Fahim commando, Mufeez Farooqi.
Mr Hussain has given the government 24 hours to apprehend those 
officials who were responsible for the murder of Fahim Commando and 
three other activists, failing which the MQM would be forced to 
observe a day of protest throughout the Sindh on Oct 18.

<a name="urge">Altaf urges Press to voice concern at State terrorism </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 18 MQM chief Altaf Hussain on Tuesday reiterated his 
condemnation of the alleged State terrorism and urged the press to 
voice concern at the genocide of the Mohajir nation. 
In a letter addressed to editors of Pakistan newspapers and journals, 
he slammed the prime minister s remarks during her meeting with 
newspaper editors that the killing of four under-custody MQM activists 
on Oct 10 was the result of action by their comrades and not extra-
judicial killings, as claimed by the MQM.
He accused the government of following a policy of summary execution 
of MQM workers who were in police custody.
Accusing the government of Benazir Bhutto of moving towards absolute 
dictatorship, Mr Hussain contended that the prime minister could not 
escape the responsibility for the murder of the Mohajirs.
More recently, he contended, removal of governments in the NWFP and 
Punjab under emergency provisions of the constitution was carried out 
in the most corrupt and fascist manner.
Mr Hussain contended that our beloved country has the misfortune of 
being ruled again and again by such acknowledged practitioners of 
State terrorism, adding that there is no one left in the 
constitutional civilian set-up that can do anything about it. 
He was of the view that the press represents the last obstacle to the 
establishment of absolute dictatorship in the country and of one-party 
State. 
But he regretted that the press, too, was under attack. In this 
context, he mentioned the suspension of six Karachi eveningers and 
 harassment of a woman editor.

fresh delimitation of constituencies.
He said the commission would involve the Press as well as the people 
whenever fresh delimitation of constituencies was undertaken.
He said the process of pre-printing revision of electoral rolls will 
be completed by May 19, 1996. The existing electoral rolls will 
remain valid as long as fresh lists are not finalised and printed, he 
said.
Mr Alam rejected the opposition s charges that the names of its voters 
were being deleted from the rolls. He said after the initiation of the 
process of preparing new lists, the commission did not have powers to 
delete any name from the existing voters lists.
Mr Alam said the commission had adopted several measures to reform the 
electoral process. A control room would be set up at the Election

Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said here on Saturday 
that All-Parties Hurriyet Conference (APHC) was the sole and 
legitimate representative of the people of the occupied Kashmir and 
the so-called elections India proposed to hold in the valley were 
nothing but a farce.
The APHC which comprised 34 political parties of the occupied Kashmir, 
she said, was the sole and legitimate representative of the Kashmiri 
people.
The prime minister said the APHC had already announced to boycott 
these elections. These elections cannot be an alternative to the 
plebiscite promised by the United Nations, Pakistan and India to the 
Kashmiri people, she added.
She said India had held similar elections in the past and the whole 
world was aware how they were held. Even the former governors and home 
ministers of the occupied Kashmir had confirmed that previous 
elections in the valley were rigged at every level, she pointed out.
She said the recent elections held in Leh area of the occupied Kashmir 
had exposed the designs of the Indian government and their claims of 
holding free elections. Out of 26 seats, the Indian administration 
ensured unopposed success of their stooges on 22 seats. A similar 
election drama has been arranged for the rest of the valley, she 
added.

When a questioner asked about the future of Altaf Hussain, the prime

ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Mohammaed Nawaz 
Sharif, in a statement said here on Saturday the country was 
witnessing a decline of state institutions and proposed a new 
citizens charter to reverse the situation.
Saying that the country was drifting fast into the orbit of anarchy, 
the former prime minister accused the PPP government of failing to 
 respect the mandate of the Opposition and said pushed to the wall, 
the Opposition has no option but to mobilise street power to counter 
the misuse of state power. 
He alleged that the Benazir government had politicised the bureaucracy 
and attempted to destroy judiciary. The PPP government s large scale 
victimisation of the Opposition, had created circumstances for 
intense political polarisation he said.
The basic cause of the nation s ill, he said, was the loss of 
political direction, and added, The incompetence and insincerity of 
the present government has further accelerated this decline and as a 
result increased the sense of despondency in the country. 
This had resulted, he said, in such a state of national apathy that 
even open admission by the Prime Minister that she saved India by 
giving them information on the Sikh insurgency in the Indian Punjab is 
not taken seriously. 
This state of affairs cannot go on for any length of time without a 
total collapse of the system.
People cannot be expected to dish out a certain proportion of their 
income in taxes and get nothing in return as a matter of right. 
Whatever strength of institutions we inherited at the time of 
independence has also been gradually whittled away by a strong and 
ambitious Executive. I propose an urgent review of the situation by 
an app party parliamentary committee to re-establish state 
Institutions and to ensure 
 Supremacy off the Parliament Independence of Judiciary Neutrality 
and effectiveness of the civil service Non-interference in the 
tenure and promotions of senior Defence Service personnel An

governments to ensure free and fair elections That financial and 
other state institutions are safeguarded against political pressures

Secretariat for which he held them responsible.
A similar demonstration was held by the PPP on Sept 11 but on that 
occasion there was a verbal exchange between the PPP and the MQM

ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 The arrested army officers had planned to take into 
custody the high command of the army on Sept 30 during the scheduled 
corps commanders meeting in Rawalpindi and then launch an Islamic 
Revolution in Pakistan.
However, they were arrested on Sept 26 after Major-General Ali Quli 
Khan, Chief of the Military Intelligence (MI), reported the issue to 
the top leadership of the army.
Simultaneous investigations have started in Quetta and Rawalpindi 
against the purported revolt of these army officers. All the arrested 
officers were sent to Quetta on Saturday night by a special plane.
This is said to be the fourth failed coup attempt in Pakistan s 
history. The first was the so-called Pindi conspiracy in early 1950s 
led by Maj. Gen. (retd) Akbar Khan. The second was during late 
Z.A.Bhutto s tenure in 1970s, known as Attock Conspiracy Case and the 
third was against late Zia-ul-Haq in early 1980s when a number of 
senior army officers including Maj. Gen. (retd) Tajammal Hussain were 
arrested.
However, there have been three successful organised coups. The first 
was in 1958 when Ayub Khan grabbed power from Skindar Mirza. Then Late 
General Yayha Khan replaced Ayub Khan in 1969. Later Zia-ul-Haq 
overthrew the elected government of late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

<a name="fate">Fate of Brown Amendment to be decided today</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai
WASHINGTON, Oct 17 The nominees of the two houses of US Congress meet 
on Wednesday to decide the fate of the foreign operations bill which 
includes the Brown amendment, amid reports that President Clinton may 
veto the bill if agreement was not reached on some controversial 
clauses.
Indications that the president may be considering a veto were given by 
the New York Times in a report on Pakistan on Tuesday. 
All signals emanating from the Pakistan camp in Washington were mixed, 
not predicting which way the conference of the two houses may go on 
the Brown amendment.
The Indian lobby, was working hard to get the supply of military 
equipment deleted from the version passed by the Senate last month as 
the House had not adopted any such provision.
Pakistan, however, received unexpected support from a leading 
Washington newspaper, the Washington Times, which strongly supported 
adoption of the Brown amendment by the conference of the two houses.
 A true display of bipartisianship in this town is about as rare as a 
swallow in winter, but if you watch closely, there might just be one 
on the horizon, the paper said editorially. 
 Believe it or not, it can be done. The paper said The legislation 
in question is an amendment offered by Sen Hank Brown to clarify 
restrictions on US aid to Pakistan, which has been frozen for the past 
five years. 
 The appeal of the Brown Amendment is that it focuses on the 
possible, which is to create a one-time exemption that will let 
Pakistan get the weapons it paid for or at least a refund. The 
amendment allows the delivery of $368 million in military equipment, 
technology and defence services contracted for before Oct 1, 1990. 
Given that the Pakistani defence is largely based on American weapon 
systems, this is important. The bulk of the remainder consists of an 
order for 28 F-16 fighter jets on which restrictions continue to 
apply. However, if a third-party buyer can be found, Pakistan stands 
to recoup its money. Simple fairness, it would seem, demands no less. 
This should be one issue that the Republican Congress and the 
Democratic president can readily agree on.

KARACHI, Oct 17 The PML Karachi division will observe protest day , 
not a strike, on Thursday, Oct 19, on the completion of two years PPP 
rule which has ruined the country. 
Calling for holding fresh elections in the country, the party leaders 
announced the Black Day programme at a press conference at Karachi.
 Whether it is a matter of interior policy, economy, educational 
affairs or the foreign front, the government s sinister actions did 
not spare even the army. 
They warned that if corrective measures were not taken, no matter 
whether Nawaz Sharif gave a call or not, people on their own would 
come out on the streets.
 On one side unemployment is on the rise, unprecedented price spiral 
and anarchy all over the country. Then there is removal of the NWFP 
and Punjab governments through unconstitutional methods and the latest 
victim of the ruling PPP is Balochistan where in Dera Bugti and Sui a 
more dangerous situation is surfacing which if not controlled, will 
bring down the whole edifice of democracy. 
They hoped that all opposition parties in general and the people in 
particular would join the protest day in a big way to express their 
 resentment against the government.
Haji Karimullah Yusufzai, Karachi ANP President, said The situation 
in Sindh is worsening day by day, particularly in Karachi not a single 
day passes when the day does not begin with killing. 
Mian Ejaz Shafi s stress was on the sinking ship of the economy. 
Pointing out the paradox in the utterances of President Farooq Leghari 
and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto he said The president in his speech 
has conceded about dismissal investment owing to law and order problem 
while the prime minister in the last session of the National Assembly 
claimed of investment to the tune of $22 billion investment in the 
country.
Mr Faizi said The government has introduced a new phenomenon to the 
killings by continual murders in judicial custody. They can escape 
>from  the grip of the law of the land, judiciary and even legislatures 
but no one could save them once the people decided to try them in 
their own (people s) court.

<a name="faci">Police facing organised terrorism, says Babar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
KARACHI, Oct 17 The Interior Minister, Maj-Gen (Retd) Nasirullah 
Babar, said here on Tuesday that police were faced with the challenge 
of countering an organised terrorism supported by gun-runners and 
drug Mafia having covert backing of foreign powers and their 
terrorists .
Gen Babar said with the quality of training, the police force was 
being imparted, he was fully convinced that our enemies at home and 
abroad would not succeed in their nefarious designs.
He said in the present era such people or groups were not only 
becoming united and organised but they were also being imparted 
regular training from the enemy country.
The minister fully agreed with the IGP that the police were faced with 
an organised terrorism with support facilities being provided to 
criminal elements by our enemy.

 <a name="blac">Black day today Gohar issues chargesheet </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 Deputy opposition leader, Gohar Ayub Khan warned on 
Wednesday that the government s handling of the opposition s black day 
protests would set the tone for our behaviour in the upcoming joint 
parliamentary session on Oct 29 .
Gohar hinted that the opposition would not be taking as harsh an 
approach as it did during last year s presidential address to the 
joint session but threw the ball in the government s court by saying, 
 of course we will first have to see how the government behaves on Oct 
19th .
He expressed the hope that the government would show restraint as the 
opposition too had planned to take out peaceful protest processions 
and rallies.
To another question, he denied any knowledge of mass arrests of our 
workers or leaders till this time .
Earlier, the opposition leader accused the government of virtually 
every possible act of commission and omission. Starting from foreign 
policy fiasco s, to the deteriorating law and order situation in the 
country, a dead economy, a corrupted judiciary and even the blatant 
misuse of the Constitution.
The opposition s Fact Sheet accused the government of helping out 
the Indians in Khalistan, capping the nuclear programme, isolating 
Pakistan diplomatically, rendering the parliament irrelevant by 
running government through ordinances and flaunting the rulings of the 
speaker National Assembly and the chairman Senate among other things.
Gohar went on to blast the government for economic crimes. He said the 
economy was virtually dead with over 70 per cent of the textile 
industry facing certain death and cited IMF s refusal to release more 
funds as a proof of the government s mucking up on the economic front. 
He said that the business community was being hounded as never before 
in the history of the country.
He said that the law and order situation had broken down all across 
the country with Karachi being pushed to the brink of a civil war 
 where lawless acts of the government agencies have wiped of all sense 
of security from the minds of the common citizens .

<a name="case">Case against Nasser termed victimisation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 18 The way a criminal case has been instituted against 
Nasser Husain reeks of political victimisation, alleged Inayat 
Hussain, spokesman for the 70-Clifton.
He said it was a normal practice in a criminal case that when the 
prosecution side lodged a report with a police station, it was 
incumbent on the SHO to examine defence witnesses before filing formal 
charges.
In the above case, he said, as the procedure had not been adopted, the 
whole process was biased.
The spokesman said in a statement, Nasser Husain is being punished as 
the prime minister and her husband think he has grown too big for his 
political boots .
Mr Nasser, with Ahmed Ali Soomro, had run Murtaza Bhutto s successful 
election campaign in Larkana in 1993. He had joined the PPP (SB) and 
become an observer in its central committee, he pointed out.
But, he said, on Oct 12 he hosted the Central Committee meeting of the 
party in which it was decided that the party would take part in the 
forthcoming by-election in Sanghar and put up Makhdoom Khaliq-ul-Zaman 
as its candidate.
The next day, i.e. Oct 14, Nasser arranged a dinner meeting between 
his chairman Murtaza Bhutto and Syed Sibghatullah Shah Rashdi alias 
Raja Sain, who is president of the Sindh PML(F), the spokesman said 
and added that when the murder of Ahmed Ali Soomro took place, Nasser 
Husain, Murtaza Bhutto and Raja Sain were in the dinner meeting.
The Sindh Home Department had claimed, he said, that they had three 
 frightened eyewitnesses that accused Nasser of the murder of Mr 
Soomro and had been shifted to safe homes and were under protective 
custody as against this for Nasser Husain s part there were more than 
25 unafraid eyewitnesses who would testify that he and Murtaza 
Bhutto left 70-Clifton at 9.15 pm and were in Raja Sain s house from 
9.15 pm till 1.45 am on the night of Saturday while Ahmed Ali Soomro 
had reportedly been murdered at 11.30 pm.
Moreover, he said, there were a dozen of eyewitnesses who would 
testify that just prior to the attack on the late Soomro, an adviser 
of the chief minister from Larkana was seen driving several times by 
the house of the deceased. They would testify that the perpetrators of 
the crime came in a white Toyota and a yellow cab and were accompanied 
by a police mobile which parted ways after the attack. 
Recalling that these were the bare facts which an impartial 
administration should have looked into before making arrest and filing 
charges, the spokesman said We are facing an increasingly insecure, 
isolated and repressive regime. Unnerved by the prospect of defeat in 
Sanghar they were resorting, almost by instinct, to fascistic 
measures. We will never succumb to these crude methods of control.

<a name="hasd">Altaf has deviated from people s mandate, says Shah</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 18 Sindh Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah has alleged 
that MQM chief Altaf Hussain has deviated from the mandate of his 
electorate and is playing in the hands of India to harm Pakistan. 
Mr Shah said anyone who tries to bring harm to Pakistan will be 
crushed. He added People who have sacrificed everything for the 
creation of Pakistan will not accept such elements. 
Mr Shah also criticised Mr Hussain for using an abusive language 
against the prime minister who was determined to crush terrorism in 
Pakistan.
He said the people of Pakistan had now seen the true face of Mr 
Hussain who, according to him, was out to destroy Pakistan by 
frequent strikes and terrorist activities.
Mr Shah also asked the PML and other parties supporting MQM whether 
they were not becoming a party to conspiracy against the country by 
supporting those who raised slogans for its division.
While appreciating the role of the police and rangers in dealing with 
the terrorists, he nevertheless conceded that there had been some 
incidents of police excesses which were being looked into.
The chief minister was of the view that these were destabilising 
factors with which the government had to deal. Many people, he said, 
voted for the MQM because they believed it was championing their cause 
and it was very difficult to convince them Mr. Hussain was really 
pursuing a policy that was detrimental to the integrity of Pakistan.
The most difficult task, he said, was to expose the real face of Mr 
Hussain and his real objectives, said the chief minister.
The chief minister claimed his government had a documentary proof that 
certain elements of the MQM were involved in activities detrimental 
to the interests of Pakistan.
He contended that Mr Hussain was fighting not only against this 
government but against the State. 
On the question of law and order, he said the government had achieved 
some success.
 Much to the dislike of the enemies of Pakistan, who want the army to 
be bogged down in the law order situation in Karachi, the government 
has taken concrete steps to pull out the army which was called out by 
the Nawaz government, and instead vested the police and rangers with 
greater responsibility, Mr Shah said.
Mr Shah said his government was planning to hold the local Body 
elections in December and that will show how popular and strong is 
the MQM as compared to the PPP and Pakistan-loving parties. 
Asked to comment on the allegations of rampant police corruption, the 
chief minister, while acknowledging the general complaint, said the 
issue must be seen in the background of the difficult Karachi 
situation and society as a whole.
 When we speak about police excesses, we must also say something 
about the circumstances and why it is so, said the chief minister. He 
said if the situation was normal, such complaints would have been very 
few. He repudiated the allegation that the police excesses had the 
government s backing.
In the context of recent MQM criticism of alleged custodial murder 
he said the government had already ordered a judicial inquiry. If 
anyone is found to be crossing the limits of the law, he will be 
prosecuted, said the chief minister.
He, nevertheless, alleged that the MQM had deliberately targeted 
police and other government institutions to bring Pakistan into 
disrepute.
GANGRAPE In this context he mentioned the allegations of gangrape 
levelled by the MQM on three occasions and said these cases were 
 politicised with mala fide intentions.
 When the government ordered a judicial probe, nobody came forward, 
not even the ladies whose honour was put at stake, for narrow 
political gain by the MQM, he said.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 Jamaat-i-Islami chief Senator Qazi Hussain Ahmad on 
Wednesday met President Farooq Leghari at the Aiwan-i-Sadr to discuss 
the recent arrest of some army officers.
He said the meeting was held at the invitation of the president who 
wanted to talk with the Jamaat chief on this issue.
Senator Qazi and his party had criticised the arrest of these officers 
and had demanded of the government to take the people into confidence 
on this issue.
He had also expressed his dissatisfaction over the government 
statement regarding the arrest of these officers and threatened to 
raise the issue in the National Assembly and the Senate.
The source said the president advised the Jamaat chief not to 
politicise the issue which was purely a case of violating army 
discipline.
The JI chief, the source said, was also requested by the president not 
to raise this issue in the parliament as it would create unnecessary 
unrest in an important security institution.
The source said the president assured Qazi Hussain Ahmad that the 
inquiry report will be made public.
Senator Qazi also assured the president that his party would not 
politicise the issue in the larger national interest, the source 
added.
He said the two leaders also discussed the situation in Karachi and 
the president sought Jamaat-i-Islami s support in helping the 
government in its efforts to restore peace in the violence-hit city.</pre><pre><hr>

following the holding of number of rounds of talks between the

The IFC quoted the Karachi Chamber of Commerce which estimates 
that the prolonged disturbances has cost city businesses more than $

<a name="furt">Further loans for Pakistan IMF calls for cut in deficit</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai
WASHINGTON, Oct 12 All the major financial institutions the World 
Bank, the IMF and the IFC have told Pakistan to cut its fiscal 
deficit and accept the IMF terms before any major project loan could 
be sanctioned.
Mr. Jafarey had told newsmen that the IMF was concerned whether 
Pakistan was pursuing the right policies they think that along with 
the capital market, fiscal deficit is the major problem the country 
has to resolve. 
Mr. Jafarey had explained that the goal of the intensive dialogue 
was to go back to a position where we are in line with the IMF. We 
would like to go back to the IMF programme. How soon can we do it and 
on what terms we will do it are the matters for negotiations. 
Pakistan had brought a number of projects to be laid on the table for 
World Bank assistance, including financing of the two billion dollar 
hydro-electric project at Ghazi Brotha.
 We were told to go and do something about the fiscal deficit during 
the time the World Bank carries out an appraisal of the Ghazi Brotha 
project. But the message was clear that unless we met their demands, 
funding for the project would not be forthcoming, the Pakistani 
official said.
 It seems we have no option but to start meeting the conditions of the 
IMF, we cannot possibly wait until the next budget as everything in 
Washington will remain on hold until we start doing what they say, 
the official said.
Economic experts said a decision by the government to meet the IMF 
targets could mean an almost certain mini-budget by December in which 
a lot of duties and taxes may be adjusted upwards cutting down the 
deficit.
These experts said the slip of tongue by the Commerce Minister 
Choudhry Ahmed Mukhtar that Pakistan may have to devalue its currency, 
may not have been that innocent in essence because such a measure 
would fit into the scheme of things that would shape up if the IMF 
targets were to be met and exports had to be given a jump start.
 A lot will again depend on the political situation as the right kind 
of atmosphere is necessary for these difficult decisions.
 If Punjab does not erupt into a crisis, Mr. Chattha stays the course 
with the PPP, Karachi does not fall into a deeper morass and Nawaz 
Sharif s opposition continues to play cool, only then Benazir Bhutto 
may find the courage to go for such decisions, they added.

<a name="acti">Action against tax evaders New steps to yield Rs 30 to 40bn</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ihtashamul Haque
ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 The government has decided to take new measures 
against tax evaders and those constantly showing less income in order 
to increase the overall annual revenue of the country.
Although sources said, she has expressed her satisfaction over the 
performance of Central Board of Revenue (CBR) which collected record 
revenue of Rs 226 billion during 1994-95, she asked the concerned 
authorities to net those who were avoiding to pay their due taxes.
Most importantly, only 32 tax-payers declared income exceeding rupees 
half a million per annum. All of these belong to Karachi. In the given 
sample the non-corporate business community of north of Karachi, 
therefore, restricted its tax contribution to the exchequer by 
limiting the maximum declaration of income to less than rupees half a 
million.

<a name="rupe">Rupee falls by 6 paisa against $</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Oct 15 The rupee depreciated by six paisa against the US 
currency on Sunday as the central bank refixed its new parity rate for 
spot buying and selling at Rs 31.68 and Rs 31.83 to a dollar.
The parity of the rupee was last lowered by seven paisa on October 3 
at Rs 31.62 and Rs 31.77 for buying and selling.
Since July 1, the rupee has lost 71 paisa against the dollar in 
monthly readjustments. Although the State Bank sources did not give 
any specific reasons for the downward revision of the parity, 
financial analysts said it was technical adjustment to keep the value 
of the rupee competitive within the basket of currencies.
Dealers, however, predicted that the rupee could hit the high mark of 
Rs 33 to a dollar in kerb during the next two weeks.

The official, who asked not be named, said the commission was in the 
process of selecting a financial adviser for the sale of a 26-percent 
stake and transfer of management.
Habib has total deposits of 179 billion rupees ($5.4 billion) in 1,868 
domestic and 66 foreign branches and total assets worth 306 billion

<a name="lcci">LCCI chief seeks tariff reforms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LAHORE, Oct 18 Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry President 
Tariq Sayeed Saigol has proposed to the government to undertake tariff 
reforms, set currency exchange rate in favour of exporters, and re-
start process of dialogue with leading business leaders to put the 
economy on right path. 
Mr Saigol said that there had been a trade imbalance of $ 1 billion 
during the first quarter of the current financial year. If the 
situation is not improved by radical measures, there is every 
likelihood that the export target for 1995-96 fixed at $ 9.2 billion, 
could not be met. Mr Saigol argued that reliance on cotton crop to 
achieve the export target was not a good omen for the economy. 
 In my view if Rupee is devalued under the prevailing economic 
conditions, it will damage our exports, he said.

 <a name="paki">Pakistan on way to economic stability </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Wednesday said 
that there is a harmony and affinity between the Centre and the 
provinces, which was, perhaps, never there before.
This, she added, goes to prove that the elected government has not 
only identified its political, economic and defence targets but has 
also made sincere and serious efforts to achieve them.
When we came to power two years ago, the country s economy was in a 
dismal condition. But now, the basic flaws have been removed. GNP 
ratio has increased and has reached 4.7 per cent this year.
Pak-America relations had been deteriorating since 1990 but the 
elected government s successful diplomatic endeavours have brought us 
to a decisive turning point i.e. the Brown Amendment. This amendment 
is a very happy news for all Pakistanis. All these achievements have 
been made possible by the grace of Almighty and by people s 
cooperation. Our goal is national security and solidarity side by side 
with consensus among all political parties and organisations on 
national issues. But we will not compromise our principles to achieve 
this goal.
We want to eliminate crime from politics. Putting an end to terrorism 
in Karachi is a part of this policy. We want the people of Karachi to 
have an atmosphere of peace and tranquillity with all civic and social 
facilities along with opportunities for economic development.

<a name="imfr">IMF rejects Islamabad s request on ESAF terms</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aslam Sheikh
ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 Pakistan s plea for a one-year moratorium for the 
implementation of conditionalities attached to the extended structural 
adjustment facility (ESAF) has been rejected by the Inter-national 
Monetary Fund (IMF), informed sources said on Wednesday.
Under the circumstances, according to informed sources here, Islamabad 
has no other option but to accelerate the pace of implementing the 
reform agenda formulated as the price for IMF s badly needed balance 
of payments support.
It includes substantial privatisation, drastic containment of 
budgetary deficit, brisker pace of tariff reform and realistic 
adjustment of external value of the Pakistani rupee.
Pakistan s predicament is that any further resistance to IMF s 
pressures means risking strained relations practically with all other 
international donors grouped together in the Aid-to-Pakistan 
Consortium.
In view of a recent setback to exports and fall in foreign exchange 
reserves, Islamabad s bargaining position has been considerably 
weakened.
Besides it needs substantial inflow of confessional loans every year 
just to service old debts. For example, out of roughly two billion 
dollars negotiated every year as new loans, 1,200 million dollars go 
towards servicing of the external debt liability.
According to indications here, the situation arising out of the IMF s 
insistence on immediate enforcement of its conditions will be reviewed 
soon after the prime minister s return to Islamabad later this month 
to decide upon future economic strategy.
