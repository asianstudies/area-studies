burnt to death. About Wahidullah, the city police claimed that he is 
an MQM unit chief and had allegedly committed 15 murders.
KARACHI, Nov. 2 Orangi, where the police shot dead MQM worker 
Naseeruddin Babu, remained tense with sporadic incidents of shooting.
MQM women activists on Saturday brought out the funeral procession of 
Naseeruddin Babu claiming that the rangers are not allowing men to 
attend it. 
An unidentified bullet-riddled body was found in Defence Phase-VII. 
The victim could not be identified. This was the second body found in

The police suspect both the victims were killed somewhere else in the

was taken away by rangers and police in front of all the family 
members.
The family claimed that the raiding party had given Wajid Ali a severe 
beating before taking him away. Relatives claimed that his body had 
marks of torture, and both legs were broken.
Party chief Altaf Hussain severely criticised Wajid s murder and 
demanded an immediate action against those who were responsible for 
it.
MQM leaders told Dawn that the family of Wajid Ali Safdar was forced 
to abandon their Orangi house by a PPP activist who allegedly enjoyed 
the backing of rangers and police.
They said two police constables, Murad and Ismail, had been frequently 
visiting the family in North Karachi to know Wajid s whereabouts. On 
Monday night when Wajid came to meet his family, the rangers 
surrounded the apartment and arrested him, the MQM claimed.

<a name="conc">Concern expressed at carnage forecast</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, DEC 1 The MQM coordination committee has expressed its 
concern over predictions which appeared in a section of press on 
Friday regarding a planned carnage on DEC 16 in the city.
 Horrifying news are part of disinformation unleashed by the 
government to arrest and kill more people in the name of violence and 
terrorism, the committee claimed.
It said Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar was on record having 
predicted in a statement that the month of December would be very 
important. 
The committee alleged the Sindh government had embarked on a plan to 
crush the urban population in the name of killing by Indian agents and 
terrorists. It said deployment of thousands of law enforcers in the 
city had exposed the government plan. 
In another statement, coordination committee Convenor Senator Ishtiaq 
Azhar condemned the killing of Naeem Ahmad, an MQM activist, who was 
buried by women in Korangi as men were not allowed to offer his 
funeral prayer and bury him .

a heavy contingent of rangers and police raided the house of Rauf 
Siddiqui, Mohibban-i-Pakistan chief organiser, in Federal B Area on 
Thursday night and arrested his brothers.

Aziz Siddiqui, 51, and Abdul Basit Siddiqui, 39, had nothing to do 
with politics. They are federal government officials, it added.

Siddiqui, the younger brother of Rauf Siddiqui who was out of the 
country for the last one-and-a-half-year.

police station.

<a name="mqms">MQM s strike disrupts city life</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 3 The MQM strike to protest the alleged high-handedness 
of the security forces widely disrupted life in the city on Sunday.
The MQM gave a strike call against an incident in Korangi in which it 
claimed rangers and police created such a situation which forced the 
women mourners to bring out the funeral procession of party worker 
Mohammad Naeem.
The Sindh government denied this and said men were also present in 
large numbers.
The second similar funeral was brought out in Orangi on Saturday. A 
spokesman for the Sindh police described both the incidents as a 
publicity stunt by the MQM.
Sunday s strike remained peaceful except for a stray incident of 
violence in which a man was shot and killed in Orangi while a private 
car was set ablaze in Federal B Area.
The troubled localities of the city, where MQM supporters are in a 
majority, remained shut throughout the day. Elsewhere in the city, the 
strike was either partial or there were no signs of strike at all.

<a name="dehl">Dehlavi for confidence building measures</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 4 Leader of the MQM negotiation team Ajmal Dehlavi, who 
returned from London after having consultations with party chief Altaf 
Hussain, said that confidence-building measures were must for holding 
successful talks.
Asked whether Mr Hussain was satisfied with the pace of the talks, Mr 
Dehlavi said When I am not convinced with the talks, how Altaf Bhai 
can be satisfied. Before resumption of talks the government ought to 
take such measures as can improve law and order situation and create 
an atmosphere of confidence only then a political solution to the 
Karachi crisis is possible. 
His attention was drawn to Mr N.D. Khan s reported statement in which 
he had said if the government s 21 points were accepted, it would lead 
to restoration of peace and tranquillity in Karachi and the situation 
of political deadlock would be overcome, the MQM team chief said this 
statement was nothing but a repeated joke as nowhere in the world a 
government had asked a political party to accept demands as it was 
always the government which was at the giving end and not the 
political party.
However, he said, he would be sending the reply of Mr Khan letter 
tomorrow or day after tomorrow with the hope that the government would 
take confidence-building measures before resumption of the talks.

<a name="mqmf">MQM fears for worker s life</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 4 The MQM feared that one of its workers, who was 
arrested along with his two brothers in Kharadhar last month, will be 
killed in a fake encounter by the Korangi police.
The MQM said Javed Raza, a member of Korangi sector committee, his 
brothers, Khalid Raza and Arif Raza, were arrested on Nov. 1. Despite 
the fact that the three were not wanted in any case they were kept in 
various police stations. Finally, they were taken to the Korangi 
police station, where Javed was booked in 17 cases and his brothers 
were booked in two cases each, they said.
The MQM claimed that on Monday Javed was produced in a special 
terrorist court by the Korangi police and after the hearing took him 
with them. But the party claimed that till late Monday night Javed was 
not brought back to the Korangi police station and feared that he 
might be killed during a fake attack on a police party as had 
happened earlier in the case of Faheem Farouqi and three other MQM 
workers.

<a name="seek">MQM seeks assurance on end to extra-judicial killings</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Dec. 5 The Mohajir Qaumi Movement has asked for an 
undertaking that extra judicial killings and other form of 
brutalities of its supporters will be immediately stopped and the 
diverse promises made to them during talks by the official negotiating 
team would be actually implemented before they can agree to restart 
the talks with the government.
In a letter addressed to the leader of the government negotiating 
team, Mr N.D. Khan, the MQM chief negotiator, Ajmal Dehlavi, has also 
pressed for a meaningful response to the points raised in his letter 
of Cot 9 and for an environment of trust to be created to enable us 
to feel that the administration is genuinely in search of a lasting 
solution to the problems we have been discussing. 
The MQM released the text of its letter sent today in reply to Mr 
Khan s communication of Nov. 15, with copies of the previous 
correspondence.
The MQM letter, sent recalls why the talks scheduled for Sept 26 could 
not be held. The reason given was the death the previous day of two 
MQM workers who were tortured by the law-enforcement agents. The MQM 
negotiating team had in a letter on Sept 25 asked the government to 
enquire into various incidents which they believed exhibited the worst 
form of state terrorism against the Mohajir youths. The government 
side replied on Oct. 5 but, according to the MQM, made patently false 
and self-serving assertions and did not look into their complaints 
afresh, objectively and with a compassionate approach .
The latest MQM communication is full of grievances that have been 
raised in their previous correspondence with the government. It 
accuses the government of adopting delaying tactics and being not 
sincere to proceed with the negotiations . In its Oct. 9 letter to Mr 
Khan, the MQM team had raised 11 specific points. They now say that 
not even one of these points was dealt with by Mr Khan, showing that 
there is not the slightest indication of any policy decision of the 
government to realistically solve the crisis in urban Sindh. 
While in their letter the MQM accuses the present administration for 
being the most incompetent and corrupt and the present state of 
economy has been mentioned. The persecution of the opposition and the 
deprivation of the people of their civic vote by denying them 
elections to local bodies are some of the other charges levelled. The 
federal government is accused of flouting provincial autonomy. The 
government s human rights record has been strongly criticised and the 
killings of four MQM worker on Oct. 10 is cited as evidence to show 
that such tragedies have become a frequent routine against which we 
have constantly protested. The MQM team has rejected Mr Khan s 
assertion that Altaf group was responsible for genocide of innocent 
peoples. In the garb of search and siege operations the law 
enforcement agencies, were guilty of larceny, plunder and other 
violations. Some of these have been highlighted by human rights 
organisations, including Amnesty International. Many political 
leaders, including the Prime Minister s brother, have also criticised 
the reckless use of state force in Karachi and southern Sindh.
The MQM team has claimed that the party s leadership has endeavoured 
to keep the negotiating process going by calling off or postponing 
protest strikes on a number of occasions to show their goodwill. But 
the violence against the MQM supporters continued to show that the 
government has not the slightest interest in the outcome of the 
negotiations nor is it sincere in solving the present crisis which 
threatens the fundamental security of the country. 
The MQM has said they are willing to present their evidence about 
extrajudicial killings by government agencies before any impartial 
international judicial tribunal to test the validity of their 
grievances and the government denials.
The letter makes it clear that there has not been the slightest 
progress in their talks with the government. The government, the 
letter said, has used the channel of conducting negotiations while 
carrying the most cruel and brutal campaign against the MQM and the 
Mohajir nation. The members of the negotiating team, it said, have 
been subjected to severe restraints on their movement, and bogus 
criminal cases have been registered against some of them.
The criticism levelled against the MQM of damaging Pakistan s image 
abroad has been refused. The issue of the supply of lethal weapons to 
government supporters raised by the MQM and denied by the government 
is again taken up in the letter. The MQM said the government denial in 
this respect is unbelievable and the government sponsorship of the 
Haqiqi terrorists is well recognised .
The correspondence released consists of five letters, three from the 
MQM and two from Mr Khan. The first letter is dated Sept 25 and is the 
one in which the MQM negotiating team drew the attention of the two 
killings and the detention of Ms Rais Fatima, Shazia Farooq and 
several MQM MPAs. The talks scheduled for September 26 did not take 
place as the MQM wanted the government to urgently deal with the 
grievances they had raised in the letter.
The leader of the MQM negotiating team has emphasised that the 
suspension of the round to talks is not because of any fault on his 
party s side. He said Progress has not been made because of 
continuous state of atrocities, including extrajudicial murders by law 
enforcement agencies, that have prevented any meaningful dialogue 
between the participants. 
 The peace that we all seek has alluded us because the pleas by the 
MQM for a cessation of manifestly unlawful operations by the law 
enforcement agencies of the state have been contemptuously ignored by 
the government, the letter said.

Staff Correspondent
LONDON, Dec. 6 The MQM will review the situation as a result of the 
latest round of arrests of its activists and supporters and the raids 
and sieges held in Orangi Town, Karachi. If the present wave of 
arrests and raids does not stop it will on Friday decide what course 
of action to take. This was stated by Mr Altaf Hussain on Wednesday 
who condemned the house-to-house search in Orangi and Korangi areas.
The MQM leader said the government in pursuance of its racist 
policies was trying to destroy the rank and file of the MQM so that 
it could eliminate its vote bank. He described the actions of the 
government as undemocratic and an abuse of human rights.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 6 The law minister and head of the government s 
negotiation team Prof. N.D. Khan received the 13-page letter on 
December 5. Commenting on the letter, the minister declared it a 
delaying tactics. There is nothing new in the letter, all the old 
demands have been repeated , he added.
The minister was of the view that first MQM should clarify its 
position about the latest statement of Altaf Hussain in which Altaf 
has threatened to change the geography of Pakistan and discuss the 
matters relating to the national security which was a real concern, 
said the minister.
The minister said that he was summoning the meeting of government s 
negotiation team to discuss the letter and other relevant issues and 
to evolve a strategy in the light of the behaviour of MQM team.
He reiterated that the talks were un-conditional from the beginning on 
the very principle of give-and-take and at this stage it will be 
unfair to attach any condition and this shows their intentions to 
delay the talks as they are seeking favour for the persons who are 
involved in unlawful activities , he claimed.

Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 6 MQM Senators Ishtiaq Azhar, Nasreen Jaleel and Aftab 
Shaikh have condemned the attempts at misinterpretation of Altaf 
Hussain s recent statement in London. 
In a joint statement, they said The MQM chief had only talked about 
the state error let loose against the Mohajirs in Sindh at a meeting. 
He never talked against the solidarity and territorial integrity of 
the country. 
 Now the vested interests and the government have started a 
vilification campaign against the MQM chief and the Mohajirs by 
calling stark lies, they said adding In fact, as far as the record 
of dismembering the country is connected, it is the PPP which is 
responsible for the 1971 tragedy.
 This example is enough to prove who is against the territorial 
integrity of the country.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent
RAWALPINDI, Nov. 30 The Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab 
Assembly, Mian Shahbaz Sharif accused the government for the current 
economic situation of the country. 
Shahbaz Sharif said that despite the fact that Benazir Bhutto has 
tried to economically strangulate his family, deploying all the state 
machinery at her command, his family was not talking about the damage 
to the business since they were convinced that the salvation of all 
Pakistanis lies in strengthening of the country.
He regretted that as a result of the disastrous economic and political 
policies of Benazir Bhutto, even the PPP and the people of Pakistan 
were being pushed towards poverty, backwardness, unemployment, 
lawlessness and corruption.
Shahbaz Sharif said that even at this stage, it was not too late for 
Benazir Bhutto to realise the gravity of the crises facing the country 
and the only democratic solution to this crises was holding mid-term 
elections so that Pakistan could be saved from further economic 
damage.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 3 Opposition leader Mian Nawaz Sharif on Sunday 
threatened the ruling party with accountability for what he called 
victimising workers and leaders of his party, when the PML came to 
power.
Condemning the six-month imprisonment of women workers on the charges 
of contempt of court last month, he said it was a slap on the face of 
all women of the country by a woman prime minister. Nawaz Sharif will 
not rest unless he forces the looters and plunderers of national 
wealth to run, the opposition leader said.
He said two 70-year-old women were also included among the workers 
recently sentenced. The government, he added, had shifted them to 
Multan jail just to torture the dependants of these workers.
Calling by name the judge who had given the verdict in the case of 
Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, he said all these jiyala judges would also be 
taken to task after the fall of the PPP government.

Staff Correspondent
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 30 Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Thursday called 
upon the journalists and newspapers owners organisations to evolve a 
code of ethics for themselves checking the tendency of printing false, 
fabricated and sensational news.
The prime minister in her hour-long speech expressed serious 
reservations over the role being played by the print media and said 
that it has become self-appointed decision-makers of the nation s 
destiny. 
Calling upon the media to publish nothing but truth, she said they 
should differentiate between the national interest and the government. 
Quoting several instances where the unnecessary criticism and 
scandalous reporting by the print media severely hurt the national 
interests, she said the national interest should be held supreme.
The government was called upon to save the newspaper industry from 
imminent disaster by withdrawing sales tax on the import of newsprint. 
The newspapers owners were thankful to the government for waiving 
import duty on newsprint. The government was also called upon to clear 
all outstanding bills of the official advertisements.

that clerics and opportunist politicians nurtured by the British, CIA 
and Gen Zia-ul-Haq were working against democracy by using the name of 
Islam.
 On the one side are the democrats with principles, on the other side 
are the forces of dictatorship which believe in weapons and 
assassination, Bhutto said.
The prime minister also held the West partially responsible for 
providing an opportunity to the clerics to exploit their cause. While 
the battle between democracy and dictatorship is shaping up in the 
Muslim world or in the South, lack of concern by the West for global 
issues such as freedom in Kashmir and debt repayment and cultural 
domination was adding fuel to combustible mixture. 
Bhutto said those who have emerged from the darkness of dictatorship 
an indirect reference to opposition leader Nawaz Sharif who started 
his political career by joining a dictatorial government often have 
mind-set shaped by the forces of tyranny.
She said instead of taking satisfaction from a constitutional order, 
some elements were serving as agent provocateurs by claiming that the 
president, parliament, judiciary, armed forces and provincial 
governments were working as hand-maidens of the political government 
instead of taking on the government in an extra-constitutional manner.
She said the political government of today was not facing any 
intrigue, conspiracy or confrontation from the different organs of the 
government as these organs were fulfilling their duties according to 
the constitution.

<a name="newd">New Delhi helping terrorists Shah</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 2 Sindh Chief Minister Abdullah Shah on Saturday 
accused the self-exiled leader of the MQM, Altaf Hussain, of helping 
India by diverting international attention from human rights 
violations being committed in Kashmir.
 Altaf Hussain is creating problems in Karachi on Indian instance, Mr 
Shah told reporters in the federal capital. Accusing India of 
involvement in incidents of terrorism in Karachi, the chief minister 
said India has a direct hand in whatever is happening in Karachi. 
 When Altaf Hussain owns known terrorists and claims that they were 
MQM workers, then I have the right to say that he is involved in 
terrorism, the chief minister said.
The chief minister said the terrorists had changed their strategy and, 
in sheer desperation, they had now started targeting high-profile 
personalities or important buildings to harass people.
He said the police had unearthed several terrorist gangs and now even 
the people of Karachi were voluntarily informing the law enforcement 
agencies about their whereabouts.
The chief minister admitted that in certain cases the police had 
transgressed their powers, but said that the government was taking 
stern action against all such officials. He said several hundred 
policemen had been dismissed from service, or suspended or even 
arrested for committing excesses or for their involvement in crimes.

<a name="baba">Babar links bombing with extradition</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 3 Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar told the 
National Assembly on Sunday that the financier of the Egyptian 
Embassy bombing disaster had been apprehended by authorities during 
the earlier part of the day.
The minister sounded optimistic about achieving a major investigative 
breakthrough with the arrest of this probable financier . He said 
that hectic efforts were also being made to establish the identity of 
the unidentified body of the second man we believe was the accomplice 
of the suicide bomber who blew up with the vehicle carrying the 
explosives .
The minister had to face some fairly barbed comments on the matters of 
security arrangements in Islamabad. He snapped back by saying that he 
had accepted the responsibility on the first day, adding If my 
resignation could contribute to the investigations I would have done 
so without your asking and said nothing however can stop a suicide 
assassin from achieving his objective .
Responding to another question, he said that Egypt s internal battles 
were being fought on the Pakistani soil but conceded that another 
contributing factor could have been Pakistan s continued extradition 
of Egyptians . He also said that an investigation had also been 
launched to establish the causes for the inordinate delay in the 
processing of an earlier warning conveyed to the foreign office by the 
Egyptian authorities.
To a question by opposition s Ejaz Shafi, he said that he had accepted 
FBI s offer of assistance only because we did not have a similar 
level of expertise in bomb blasts investigations and added I d 
rather adopt all measures that would help the investigations rather 
than stand on ceremony .

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 3 The government hopes to bring down bank borrowing 
from  Rs49 billion in five months to Rs40 billion by the end of 
December and bring it back within the budgetary limit of Rs30 billion 
by the end of the current fiscal year.
Prime Minister s Adviser for finance and economic affairs, V.A 
Jaffarey told a Press conference here on Sunday that measures to 
mobilise additional resources announced on October 28 and the steps 
taken to keep a strict control on expenditures would help the 
government to end the year with a deficit of 4.6 per cent rather than 
5 per cent of the GDP fixed in the budget.
Mentioning the recent mini run on the foreign exchange accounts, due 
to mainly, according to Jaffarey, rumours that foreign exchange 
accounts were being frozen. He said they did not amount too much and 
the situation was not alarming. The external position has also been 
strengthened by the fact that we have standby arrangement with the 
IMF.
He requested the Press not to encourage rumours and asked them to 
refer rumours to us before using them in the news stories. He 
welcomed criticism, but wanted the editors to discourage false 
reporting.

<a name="pmse">PM seeks report on bourses in 2 days</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 3 Agreeing with the perception of the chiefs of the 
three stock exchanges of the country that the prevailing liquidity 
crunch was mainly responsible for the long run of bears on the local 
bourses, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on Sunday formed a committee 
headed by chairman Corporate Law Authority to examine demands of the 
stock exchanges, including a proposal for setting up of a support fund 
to rescue the market which plunged to an all time low of 1322 points 
in the share index, last week.
After an hour long meeting with the presidents of Karachi, Lahore and 
Islamabad stock exchanges, the prime minister also ordered immediate 
release of National Investment Trust (NIT), Industrial Corporation of 
Pakistan (ICP) and State Life Insurance Corporation (SLIC) funds out 
of the proceeds of the Privatisation Commission.
The committee has been asked to submit its report in two days time 
after consulting State Bank, NIT, ICP, Employees Old- Age Benefit 
Institution, Privatisation Commission and SLIC, chief of three bourses 
later told a Press conference.
When asked as to what would be the size of the proposed support fund, 
he said they had not yet specified the amount. We did not go with an 
estimate. First we wanted to know whether it could be done, he added.
The prime minister also assured that the privatisation of PTC would be 
completed by March 31 next when 26 per cent shares along with the 
management would be handed over to the strategic investors.

suggestions of the chiefs of three bourses to rescue the sinking 
market, has endorsed their demand for the withdrawal of 10 per cent 
tax on bonus shares, in its report presented to the prime minister on 
Tuesday evening, official sources said.
Mr Shamim Khan said that during the deliberations of last two days the 
committee had consulted representatives of the NIT, ICP, Employees Old 
Age Benefit Investment (EOBI), Central Board of Revenue, Privatisation 
Commission and officials of the insurance wing of the ministry of 
commerce.
He hoped that the measures recommended to the prime minister would 
rescue the market which plunged to an all time low of 1322 last week.
However, Mr Shamim Khan refused to comment on the other demands of the 
bourse presidents, including the setting up of a support fund for the 
market.
They had also demanded that the government should make legal 
provisions allowing the EOBI to invest in the share market.
Revival of investment allowance, two way convertibility of PTC 
vouchers into general demand receipts (GDRs) and expeditious 
privatisation of the Pakistan Telecommunication Corporation were the 
other demands put forth by the three bourses to the prime minister.

Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 5 The government has taken a serious notice of the 
statement of MQM chief Altaf Hussain in which he has talked about 
geographical changes, Sindh Planning Minister Nisar Ahmad Khuhro told 
newsmen, adding We expect from the people that they would not allow 
any one to endanger the solidarity of the country. 
Mr Khuhro was also critical of the statement of Ajmal Dehlavi, leader 
of the MQM negotiation team, in which he had said that armed struggle 
is justified. 
Mr Khuhro also referred to photographs in which only women 
participated. He said It was part of the MQM campaign to bring a bad 
name to the government. It was aimed at showing the world that in 
Pakistan, where a woman is prime minister, owing to police threats to 
men, women were compelled to do the burial of the dead. 
 The photograph of the funeral procession of a so-called MQM 
activists, who was wanted in heinous crimes, was in itself 
contradictory as in the photograph men were clearly seen standing in 
the funeral procession, he added.
The minister said a hysterical situation was created by the 
photograph and a strike call was given, making life of common man 
miserable.

The sources said the possibility of the government withdrawing a 
number of cases against the former prime minister and his family to 
enable legal experts to focus their attention on other cases which 
have some potential cannot be ruled out.
According to the sources, officials dealing with the cases concerned 
had studied them in detail only to conclude that no action was 
possible against the accused as no evidence was available to 
substantiate the charges.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
RAWALPINDI, Nov. 30 Mir Murtaza Bhutto, Chairman of Pakistan People s 
Party (Shaheed Bhutto group), on Thursday vowed to save the PPP from 
any split saying that the loot of Zardari can be divided but the 
party cannot. 
Though Ms Bhutto and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, remained the main 
target of criticism but he also referred occasionally to Nawaz Sharif.
There was not much difference between the official PPP and the 
opposition PML in corruption and loot and plunder of the country, he 
said.
Mir Murtaza touched all issues and criticised the government on all 
counts.
 If voted to power I will nationalise all the industrial units being 
dished out to the favourites, he said, adding that he would also 
review all the deals made by the present government with the foreign 
investors, particularly in the energy sector.
Mr Murtaza presenting his case before the people asked whether he had 
done any wrong by asking Benazir to hold elections in the party, to 
throw out the murderers of the late Bhutto, to reinstate Begum Bhutto 
as the chairperson and to keep record of the party funds.
The party was not the heritage of anybody it belonged to peasants, 
labourers and the masses, he said.
Benazir Bhutto, he said, had twice got the power but she never think 
of salvaging her father s honour by reopening his trial. Benazir 
Bhutto who was not loyal to her father, her mother and her brother how 
she can be loyal to the masses, he questioned.

But, he ruled out any connection between the existing political

Murtaza said inflation had broken the back of the common people. The 
100 per cent increase in the prices of commodities of daily use had 
particularly affected the salaried class and daily wage-earners.
He claimed that the government had decided to freeze the foreign 
currency accounts but it could not do so under US threat to stall a 
$6,000 million IMF approved loan for Pakistan.

<a name="khar">Kharal accuses Nawaz of being RAW agent</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 5 Federal Information Minister Khalid Ahmed Khan 
Kharal accused Nawaz Sharif of being a RAW agent and a criminal in 
an emotional outburst in the House on Tuesday.
Provoked by the remarks of opposition s Chaudhry Zulfiqar, Mr Kharal 
jumped up from his seat and shot off a volley of serious accusations 
against the leader of the opposition. Jabbing the air angrily with his 
fists, the minister said Mian Nawaz had looted national funds by 
usurping the money from state banks for the expansion of his own 
industrial empire. He also named four textile mills which he charged 
had been funded by misusing the prime ministerial office.
An equally angry Chaudhry Zulfiqar bounced back into the argument with 
the sarcastic argument that we know who is a RAW agent because it 
wasn t Nawaz who admitted helping Rajiv and preventing the 
disintegration of India, it wasn t us who hijacked a Pakistani 
aircraft, and we also know which government s interior minister handed 
over the list of Sikh militants of East Punjab to the Indian 
government. 
Although over nine opposition members indulged in Babar bashing, none 
could match the intensity of the blistering attack launched by Khwaja 
Asif.
Questioning the interior minister s zeal to uncover corruption , he 
challenged him to investigate the real causes behind the deliberate 
creation of a diesel crisis by certain people in petroleum business 
which resulted in the emergency buying of diesel at a much higher rate 
of 32 cents per litre instead of the contracted rate of 14 cents. 
He said Gen Babar was only indulging in needless bellicose rhetoric 
and creating cases which weren t even there.
Apart from making a serious criticism of the interior minister s 
performance, Mr Asif did not spare any opportunity to mock the 
beleaguered minister.

<a name="kara">Karachi crisis more economic than ethnic, says Burki</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 5 Shahid Javed Burki, a World Bank vice president, 
said here on Monday the Karachi problem was not so much an ethnic 
problem as it was an economic question.
Mr. Burki said conventional wisdom about Karachi focused on the city s 
 difficult and seemingly intractable ethnic situation. However, he 
added, a deeper and more informed look at Karachi s socio-economic 
development in over the last few years would indicate that some 
segments of the city s population have suffered extreme deprivation 
because of the profound changes in the structure of the country s 
economy. 
He said if we understand the reason why poverty is returning to 
Pakistan, we will also begin to understand why it has been so 
difficult to resolve the conflict in Karachi. Opining that the 
country had reached a point where a programme for action was needed, 
Mr. Burki suggested a ten-point plan of action 
First, he said, the government must revive economic growth it should 
aim to double the gross domestic product between now and the year 
2005. This implies a rate of growth of seven per cent a year, and an 
increase in per capita income of over 4 per cent a year.
 Second, a serious attention needs to be given to rebuilding the 
institutions that have either perished or are in a state of serious 
disrepair. Institutions include the system of administration, the 
legal and judicial systems, political parties which are needed to 
intermediate between the rulers and the ruled..
 Third, Pakistan needs to put back life into the sector of agriculture 
which, in spite of all the developments that have taken place in the 
past, remains the mainstay of the economy.
Pakistan, he said, needed a market based agricultural system rather 
than a system in which, over a long period of time, price and tax 
distortions have piled upon each other to the point that the real 
potential of the agricultural sector has been totally camouflaged. 
 The time has come to do away with subsidies on such agricultural 
inputs as water, seeds and chemicals to allow the farmers to obtain 
full market prices for their outputs and to have available to them the 
full option to trade in the domestic and international markets and to 
allow the state to tax agricultural incomes as it does incomes from 
any other economic activity. 
Fifth, the functions of the government should be decentralised so that 
they respond effectively to the wishes and aspirations of the people.
Sixth, a comprehensive programme needs to be formulated to help the 
women of Pakistan to achieve their economic potential. Women s rights 
should not be judged inferior to general human rights women should be 
provided the opportunity to educate themselves, and to enter the work 
force. 
Seventh, the state needs to provide for those who cannot meet their 
basic needs. With the initiation of the zakat, usher and baitul-maal 
programmes.
Eighth, Pakistan needed a system of health insurance that would 
provide access to health institutions even for those who could not 
afford them. Such an insurance system can be combined with privately 
managed pension programmes that would guarantee people with incomes 
past their working lives. 
Ninth, he said, a sturdy safety net should be erected to catch the 
people who are likely to fall into poverty as the economy restructures 
itself. Pakistan is unique even among the poor countries of the world 
in not having any formal system that can come to the assistance of the 
people who suffer losses in jobs or serious declines in incomes that 
are the inevitable consequences of economic transformation. 
Tenth, and finally, he said Pakistan could no longer postpone the 
development of a comprehensive programme for providing basic 
education, primary health care, and the opportunity to control the 
size of the family to all the citizens. The Social Action Programme 
is a step in the right direction but the temptation must be resisted 
to politicise it by allowing employment opportunities only to loyal 
political workers. 
Today, Pakistan needs to create four million new jobs every year in 
order to accommodate the new entrants to the labour force. This number 
is well beyond the economy s current capacity.
With a highly skewed distribution in incomes which had gotten worse in 
recent years, he said he would suggest that an economy that had the 
characteristics of Pakistan needed to see GDP increase at a rate twice 
the increase in population growth to make a serious difference in the 
incidence of poverty.</pre><hr><pre>

The prime minister said the government had enough funds, and there was

Earlier, she told reporters that there was no economic crises in the 
country, and everything appearing in the Press on this issue was 
baseless and un-founding. This is a part of malicious propaganda

The Prime Minister also held the Press responsible for spreading, what 
she said, irresponsible news without ascertaining the facts. The

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Nov. 30 The rupee fell to a record low level against the US 
dollar on Thursday as there were not many sellers around Rs 36.23 for 
a dollar on the open market and most of the buystops remained 
unsatisfied.
The dollar s buying and selling rates on the open market were quoted 
at Rs 36.20 and 36.23, a new post-devaluation low against the official 
rates of Rs 34.25 and 34.42 to a dollar.
They said most of the rumours about the state of the economy and 
financial position of the government will die in due course as they 
are not based on hard facts.
However, the big gap of Rs 1.81 between the open market and official 
rates provide a manoeuvring ground to bargain-hunters and speculative 
forces, which in turn have almost cornered the open market dealings.
 The currency market is in near-turmoil as it is hard to find dollar 
even at the asking prices, they added.

<a name="howr">How real are the fears of bankruptcy?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M.B Naqvi
THE PAKISTANI rupee lost 38 paisa in the open market on November 22. 
The same day the papers told us (a) that the treasury is dishonouring 
government cheques and (b) the various banks were buying dollars to 
meet the demand from those who were trying to withdraw from their 
foreign currency accounts in large numbers.
The State Bank had to deny that it had no cash to honour the 
government cheques. There were other apprehensions and the country was 
in the grip of rumours of imminent crisis, if not collapse, together 
with expectations of yet another devaluation by at least three per 
cent.
This was despite the news that the government had, after intensive 
negotiations with the IMF, managed to clinch a deal for a standby 
credit of 600 million dollars, repayable over 15 months at higher than 
usual ESAF rate of interest. How high these rates are has not been 
disclosed.
No doubt the position would remain considerably difficult but it will 
be manageable. The State Bank expertise in making do with shuffling of 
credits and liabilities with a dash of short term borrowing should see 
us through to the end of the second quarter of the current year when 
the receipt of the second tranche of the standby credit would again 
lead to relative stability and improved outlook.
Many others, while conceding the substance of the foregoing, say that 
the real crisis lies elsewhere there are three areas of grave 
concern the first is the budgetary position. The second is balance of 
payments weaknesses that is truly structural. The third area of grave 
concern is inflation that is, in real life, shooting beyond 20 per 
cent, no matter what Statistics Division dishes out (14 per cent?)
The budgetary position is truly difficult. Despite the Ads/news of 
departmental achievements, the stark reality of the tax base being 
much narrower than need to be can no longer be glossed over. The 
hiatus between revenues and expenditures is likely to grow rather than 
contract. The recent (October) measure devaluation, enhancement of 
regulatory duties, and increased POL prices is sure to cause upsets 
in all budgetary expectations.
But as the critics have said that devaluation step would boomerang 
The benefit of exports would be much less than losses the economy 
would incur in terms of cost-push inflation and of course the increase 
in debt servicing charges.
It is now being conceded that the maximum benefit to exports is likely 
to go as far as 10 per cent and that too would remain operative for 
about three to four months at the most. The recent rumours of further 
devaluation show that even this estimate of three to fours months is 
overly optimistic. Meanwhile the enhancement of regulatory duties and 
increase in POL prices have led to a wholesale increase in prices of 
inputs and infrastructure facilities, estimated anywhere from 20 to 30 
per cent. This is the real cause of the upset in both the budgetary 
and balance of payments spheres.
The joker in the pack, as always in our case, is inflation. The 
datumline was 13 per cent inflation before the October steps were 
taken. What would be the overall effect remains to be seen. As noted 
many prices have gone up by 20 percent or more as a result. Their 
overall impact on the indices of the wholesale prices COL and SPI is 
awaited. While some are alarmed, others are hopeful that the recent 
spurt in imports is a healthy sign because it indicates that the 
import of more machinery intermediates and raw materials, as well as 
agricultural inputs indicate that for the immediate future six months 
to a year the output is likely to increase. That should prevent 
inflation rate rising too high. But what about the period between now 
and the next six months or so?
That remains an area of uncertainty and weakness. Should the prices 
tend to rise faster than the economy managers had hoped they would, 
the governments ability to do what it is doing trying desperately to 
keep the expenditures confirm to budgetary allocations would be 
gravely endangered as the effects of inflation are not always wholly 
calculable. These can, in severe cases, destabilise the society. But 
even in moderately high doses working classes ant government employees 
can suddenly become strident in demanding cost of living increases 
here and now, upsetting quite a few estimates. That the budgetary 
excesses would burst the monetary targets, leading to more inflation.
Structural Weaknesses
The structural weaknesses thus indicated cannot be tackled by ad hoc 
measures that our governments tend to take. This is not a case of 
slip here or there. It is far more than deviation from a given target 
it renders the budget unrealistic.
The phenomenon is certainly covered under the rubric of the absence of 
work ethics and the culture of tax paying. But empty preaching is not 
the remedy. It is common place to talk of rich farmers not paying tax 
and that about Rs 200 billion is said to be the realisable potential 
from  this class It is true enough. No less significant is the fact 
that the well-heeled gentry in industry and trade is not paying its 
taxes honestly by all estimates, urban rich folk too pay only a small 
part of what they ought to pay whole sections of small to medium 
businessmen simply pay nothing. There is the whole raging black market 
that pays simply nothing. How much is it is anyone's guess 40 
percent? 50 per cent? or what?
The fact of the matter insofar as expenditure side is concerned, is 
that the real motto of the successive governments has been borrow, 
borrow and borrow some more. The development expenditures Islamabad 
rulers believe, are owed us by world community. Ten policy-makers have 
boxed themselves in a policy orientation and a mind-set that 
predicates our being bailed out on foreign friends while we go on 
consuming far more than we produce. No matter who is responsible for 
it, it is now clear that this mental habit is now to be broken because 
those whom we thought would always bail us out are now refusing to do 
so.
Obviously the Press cannot be told the precise details of what 
precisely happened in the week along negotiations that Mr V.A. 
Jaffarey, the Finance Adviser to the Prime Minister had conducted 
with the IMF. 
Some facts we know the old ESAF and Extended Facility arrangements 
have broken down and should be treated as having been cancelled a new 
Standby Credit with some inevitable conditionalities is likely to be 
approved later this month and there is a prospect that a new ESAF and 
EFF agreement is likely to be signed for three years beginning with 
1996-97. General idea of that agreement's conditionalities can be 
easily guessed at old ESAF's third year's target will become those of 
1996-97 and those for subsequent years can be projected. 
However, the precise conditionalities that Pakistan has to comply with 
during 1995-96 remain to be spelled out in detail probably in the 
shape of one or more dreaded mini-budget and perhaps a more 
'realistic' adjustment police for the managed float for the national 
currency. Mr Jaffarey has given enough details the Fund has forced 
Pakistan virtually to go back to interrupted ESAF programme targets 
virtually in to except that it is now given a slight concession in the 
matter of budget deficit target. Instead of 4 per cent (of GDP) 
Islamabad is being permitted a deficit of the size of 4.6 per cent. 
Obviously a lot more pain has to be endured. Why? It also seems the 
IMF has overlooked the last June's 'deviation regarding not bringing 
down the maximum import tariffs to the desired 45 per cent in 1995 96, 
Pakistan will have to bring it down to 35 per cent in 1996-97. 
Islamabad will also have to live with a higher ($ 2.8 billion) deficit 
on the current account. 
Because we cannot balance our books, our secular deficit in the 
balance of payments however around $ 2.5 billion a year and it is sure 
to be nudged up to three billion dollars barrier. This is slightly 
more than the secular deficit on the external trade account, 
indicating other weaknesses. And this is when Pakistan economy 
receives development loans and other credits that range from dollars 
three billion to four billion from Consortium and other countries. 
This is now an unsustainable position. The period of free lunches has 
to come to an end, no matter what IMF says. Nobody owes us our 
development or excessive consumption. Politics underlying the 
Pakistan-BWI (Bretton Woods Institutions? relationship needs to be 
studied with greater care. It would seem the country has not been 
paying adequate attention to the political desires' of the donors 
World Bank, IMF, US, Japan European Union most others (except perhaps 
China). The bruising spat we have had this year with the IMF is only a 
beginning. More should be expected down the road.

<a name="enco">Govt encounters speculative reports in home markets</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 2 The government has mounted an earnest offensive 
against what it believes to be rumour-mongering and disinformation 
campaign in the newspapers about the state of the economy.
Mr. V.A. Jafarey, governor State Bank, Mohammad Yakoob, chairman 
Corporate Law Authority, Shamim Ahmed Khan and Waqar Masood, 
additional secretary economic affairs in the PM Secretariat appeared 
on TV together to reassure the nation that the state of Pakistan was 
not about to go bankrupt.
Faced with a resource crunch of the most serious magnitude following 
an unusually bad first quarter in which the borrowing limit for the 
whole year (Rs.30 billion) was exceeded by at least Rs five billion to 
bridge the widening gap between income and expenditures, the 
government took a series of corrective steps in a totally non-
transparent manner that gave rise to a lot of damaging market 
speculations.
While these stories and the stories of diversion of funds from 
Pakistan to other markets were still circulating, the government went 
and sealed a foreign bank of high standing on a purely technical 
matter. This one single step sent a wave of panic among the general 
public and gave credence to the rumours that the government was about 
to freeze the foreign bank accounts.
It was not any government official, but a newspaper which pointed out 
in its story on the subject that under Article 8 of the agreement 
Pakistan had signed with IMF, it cannot do such a thing. So, it can be 
seen from the above sequence of events that it were not the newspapers 
that had presented a distorted picture of the economy, but the picture 
had got distorted by various non- transparent actions of the 
government.
The government undermined its credibility by going back to the IMF 
within five months of repudiating its programme and also by announcing 
a mini-budget within four months of the annual budget. Also its action 
of sealing the Emirates Bank did not do much good to its credibility.

<a name="loan">Loan decision on 13th IMF monitoring situation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 The Executive Board of the IMF will now meet on 
December 13 to discuss and approve the 15-month $600 million standby 
arrangement with Pakistan, IMF sources said on Sunday.
The IMF was closely monitoring the situation in Pakistan after the 
recent near-collapse of the stock markets and a mini-run on the 
foreign exchange deposits.
Experts associated with the IMF and observing the Pakistan situation 
do not agree with the Pakistan Government explanation that the press 
was to be blamed for the present situation.
 There have been mistakes committed by the Government and they should 
better admit those mistakes and try to redress them, one expert said.
He listed, among others, the lack of firm public commitment by the 
Government to the restoration of the IMF programme, even after the 
signing of the standby arrangement, as one such mistake.
Other harmful actions of the Government include its failure to control 
spending and instead reliance on non-bank borrowing like the launching 
of the Rs 25,000 bonds which experts think was one way of admitting 
that we are unable to cut our spending but we will borrow money lying 
under the mattresses of people which otherwise should have gone to the 
private sector.
The statements made by the Prime Minister and some other ministers 
that the State Bank had unlimited capacity to print money was taken by 
these experts as another wrong message sent to the market where the 
inflation is already extremely high. What they are saying by making 
such statements is that inflation was not a worry and the Government 
was ready to print as much currency as was needed. The closure of the 
Emirates Bank was another blunder committed by the Government and 
experts think a proper message should be sent to the market by not 
only the Government apologising but also taking some action against 
those who took the decision.

<a name="stoc">Stocks stage broad recovery as index gains 47 points</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 4 Stocks staged a broad recovery aided chiefly by 
positive response from the prime minister after meeting the bourse 
chiefs to pull the market out from the current impasse, lifting the 
KSE 100-share index by another 47 points.
The market has recovered over 100 points during the last three 
sessions, which means a recouping of market capitalisation of Rs 18 
billion.
However, it generally believed that the direction of the market will 
be clear after the panel set up by the Prime minister finalises it 
recommendations to aid the market.
The recovery was largely led by bank shares, which came in for active 
short-covering at the lower levels, leading gainers among them being 
MCB, Bank al-Habib, Metropolitan Bank, Askari Bank, Crescent Bank and 
Bankers Equity.
They were followed by leading synthetic shares, under the lead of 
Dewan Salman, Dhan Fibre and Pakistan Synthetics and so did cement 
shares, major gainers among them being Pakland Cement, Dadex, Essa 
Cement, and Maple Leaf Cement.
A smart rally of Rs 15 in PSO led the advance in the energy sector 
where the current favourite Hub-Power and Shell also showed good gains 
amid active short-covering.
Both PTC vouchers and Telecard were actively traded on news of two-
conversion of the GDR for the former and so did blue chips such as 
Adamjee Insurance, ICI Pakistan, Brooke Bond and Siemens Pakistan in 
other sectors.
Barring modest losses in MNCs such as Philips, Pakistan Elektron, 
Ciba-Geigy, Wellcome Pakistan, and some others, losses elsewhere were 
fractional and reflected lack of support.
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, sharply higher by Rs 
2.30 on 1.745 million shares followed by Hub-Power, up Rs 1.60 on 
1.728 million shares, Dhan Fibre, steady 45 paisa on 926,500 shares, 
Dewan salman, higher Rs 1.60 on 530,000 shares.
The other actively traded shares were led by Faysal Bank, up Rs 1.05 
on 440,100 shares, Ebrahim Energy, lower 25 paisa on 179,500 shares, 
Askari Bank(r), up Rs 4 on 162,000 shares, and PICIC, off 35 paisa on 
156,000 shares. There were some other notable deals also.
Trading volume totalled 11.587 million shares as compared to 12.476 
million shares at the last weekend.
There were 335 actives, out of which 179 shares rose, while 97 fell, 
with 59 shares holding on to the last levels.

<a name="noqu">No quick-fix solutions to stock market slump</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dilawar Hussain
KARACHI, Dec. 4 The government, of late, seems to have perfected the 
art of finding simplified solutions to complex economic and business 
problems. The learned Commerce Minister said and the Finance Minister, 
who also happen to be our PM, baffled economists last week by 
challenging the opponents claim that the government is going 
bankrupt. They observed How can the government go bankrupt when we 
control the Security Printing Press and can print as many currency 
notes as we like! 
The government spared the operators of the capital market by not 
repeating its belief that the market was being manipulated by big 
players and in turn, the heads of the country s bourses did not 
mention the lack of investors confidence that stems principally 
from  the government s inability to improve the law and order in 
Karachi, the country s financial capital, as the major factor in 
fuelling the bearish fire. Sirjuddin Cassim, the President of KSE, 
actually was quoted to have gone as far as to assert that law and 
order situation in Karachi was not the main problem plaguing KSE and 
that the industrial production had remained unaffected by strike 
calls.
The stock market representatives, if they had mustered the courage, 
could have easily contested the government s allegation of 
 manipulation by the logic. They could have taken up the vital 
question of sagging investor confidence , instead of sweeping it 
under the carpet. Ask any broker, investor, capital market operator, 
or anyone who is anybody at any of the brokerage houses local or 
foreign. He would almost invariably cite evaporation of investors 
confidence again of both local and foreign as the prime reason for 
the shares slump. Lack of liquidity, taking the second place.
While totally ignoring one-half of the reason for the malady, the 
Sunday deliberations sought to address the other half Liquidity. 
Incontrovertibly, the steps reported to be taken would put a temporary 
floor under the market fall.
The other recommendations by the exchanges, to which the government 
gave sympathetic hearing, were also admittedly in the right direction 
Two-way convertibility of PTC GDRs, reactivation of investor scheme by 
ICP, correct interpretation of prudential regulations regarding loans 
obtained on the shares of listed companies, investment of pension 
funds in stocks, enabling EOBI to invest in shares, withdrawal of tax 
on bonus shares and treatment of capital gains earned by insurance 
companies at par with other investors.
Many serious analysts are skeptic they believe the 20-month slump has 
eroded a quarter of the market, which equals around Rs 120 billion. 
How much of that would the Rs one billion be able to retrieve, is a 
64-million dollar question. The institutional buying may spark a short 
term rally, but once the funds have been saturated, nothing could 
prevent the bears from re-entering the rings.
It is thus that the major problem of the stock market in not liquidity 
but sentiment. For the genuine long-term investment to be revived, the 
problem of sagging investors confidence has to be recognised and 
addressed. Economy must not only be claimed to be improving but must 
also be seen to be improving. And the same goes for the law and 
order situation in Karachi and the overall political stability in the 
country. Confidence needs to be created in the minds of the local 
investors so that they visualise the market with optimism and can 
invest with the long-term investment perspective, instead of the short 
term speculative gains in mind. The foreigner will return when they 
see rewards more attractive then the risks involved. It will only be 
then that the stock market will begin to head north. All other quick-
fix solutions are not likely to work.

<a name="inve">Investors make massive buying as volume soars to 22m</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 5 Volume soared to an eight-month peak level of 22 
million shares on Tuesday as investors made massive buying on the blue 
chips counters aided chiefly by a general perception of a near-term 
bullish outlook.
The KSE 100-share index showed a fresh rise of 29.82 points at 
1,446.67 as compared to 1,416.85 as base shares attracted good support 
at the current lows.
Most floor brokers believe that the near-term outlook is promising but 
its directions will largely be set by the recommendations of the panel 
set up by the Prime Minister to formulate steps to boost the ailing 
market.
Plus signs again dominated the list as blue chips remained in strong 
demand. But the bulk of the buying was centred around the trend 
setter, PTC vouchers and Hub-Power, which together accounted for one 
third of the total volume on heavy covering purchases.
Lever Brothers topped the list of big gainers, up Rs 48 followed by 
Adamjee Insurance and Dadabhoy Insurance, which rose by Rs 12 to 27 
respectively.
Other leading gainers were led by Telecard, Rafhan Maize, Pakistan 
Oilfields, and Shell Pakistan, rising by Rs 3 to 7.
Bank shares rose in unison on heavy covering purchases at the lower 
levels, major gainers among them being Askari, Al-Towfeek, Citicorp 
Al-Faysal, PICIC, Crescent and Union Bank, rising by Rs 2 to 3.25. 
There were several other good gainers.
Big losers were led by Pakistan Gum Chemicals, Frontier Sugar, which 
fell by Rs 7.50 followed by Universal Insurance and General Tyre.
Dreamworld made debut at Rs 9 against its face value of Rs 10 and 
ended around Rs 7.50 but without any deal.
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 60 paisa on 6.115 
million shares followed by Hub-Power, firm five paisa on 3.146 million 
shares, Dewan Salman, steady 30 paisa on 1.021 million shares, and 
Faysal Bank, up 35 paisa on 878,500 shares.
The other actives were led by Fauji Fertiliser, higher 50 paisa on 
448,700 shares followed by Dhan Fibre, unchanged on 636,000 shares, 
LTV Modaraba, higher 60 paisa on 398,000 shares, and PICIC, up Rs 2.85 
on 336,500 shares. There were many other notable deals also.
Trading volume rose to 22.251 million shares bettering its early July 
figure of 18 million shares thanks to heavy buying in pivotals.
There were 320 actives, out of which 210 shares rose, 61 fell, with 49 
holding on to the last levels.

<a name="upwa">Upward drive on stock market intercepted</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Dec. 6 The recent upward drive on the stock market was 
intercepted as dealers moved in to cash in on the higher levels amid 
light trading.
But profit-selling did not assumed an alarming proportions as was 
reflected by steep decline in the turnover. Only big players rolled 
positions from one counter to the other to take strong technical 
positions.
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100-share fell 19.01 points at 
1,427.65 as compared to 1,446.66 on Tuesday, reflecting the weakness 
of the base shares.
Selective buying emerged strong on some of the blue chips counters, 
lifting their prices substantially higher under the lead of PSO, which 
spurted by Rs 11 followed by Dadabhoy Cement, which suddenly burst 
into activity apparently on encouraging corporate news, rising by Rs 
15 just in one go.
Other prominent gainers were led by Nestle Milkpak, Karam Ceramics, 
EMCO Industries, Dawood Hercules, Brooke Bond, EFU, Essa Cement and 
Bawany Air, which rose by one rupee to Rs 2.50.
Lever Brothers, which rose by Rs 48 overnight lost more than a half of 
the gain, falling by Rs 25 followed by Adamjee Insurance, which 
suffered a decline of Rs 10 on selling at the last four days 
persistent rise.
Among the MNCs, which eased sharply Dewan Salman, Searle Pakistan, 
Indus Motors, and Highnoon Lab, falling by Rs 2 to 4.
Bank shares fell in unison on profit-selling at the inflated levels 
but big losers among them were Al-Faysal, Al-Towfeek, Bank al-Habib, 
Bankers Equity, Citicorp, MCB, Crescent Bank and KASB & Co, falling by 
Rs 1.75 to 3.
Other prominent losers were led by leading ICP mutual funds including 
8th and 9th, Dadabhoy Insurance, Pioneer Cement, and S.G.Power.
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, unchanged on 3.190 
million shares followed by PTC vouchers, easy 60 paisa on 2.584 
million shares, Dewan Salman, off Rs 1.20 on 607,000 shares, and 
Faysal Bank, lower 40 paisa on 397,000 shares.
The other actives were led by Dhan Fibre, easy 10 paisa on 373,800 
shares, Pioneer Cement, off Rs 3.10 on 296,600 shares, Honda Atlas, 
lower 60 paisa on 297,00 shares, Cherat Cement, off 75 paisa on 
168,000 shares and Al-Faysal Bank, off Rs 1.50 on 137,000 shares. 
There were several other good deals also.
Turnover figure fell to 13.278 million shares from the overnight 
22.516 million shares owing to the absence of leading sellers.
There were 338 actives, out of which 212 shares suffered fall, 77 
rose, with 49 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="taqa">Taqat ka nasha</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee
JANUARY 4 1991, my letter headed Government Reneges published in 
Dawn Why does the Minister of Finance, Sartaj Aziz, and his ministry 
discredit Nawaz Sharif s government instead of helping it raise its 
credibility in the eyes of the people of Pakistan and those of its 
lenders within and without the country? Should not the government s 
word, and written word at that, be its absolute bond?
 The National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC), fully owned by 
the federal government, encouraged people, Pakistanis and others, 
irrespective of nationality, religion, caste or creed, to deposit 
money with it for (as the very name suggests) national development, 
upon receipt of which it issued to the depositors bearer certificates 
of deposit promising to pay the bearer of such certificates the amount 
invested along with profit (interest) accrued up to the date of 
maturity, at the rates agreed, upon the mere surrender by the 
bearers to it of such certificates.
 Such promises made by the NDFC, on behalf of the Government of 
Pakistan, were honoured by it until Nawaz Sharif s government assumed 
power in November 1990. Since then, the NDFC has been ordered by the 
ministry of finance to renege on the promise it made, not to pay the 
sums it promised to pay but to pay them less by deducting Zakat on 
sums deposited with it up to five years ago.
 It is indeed a matter of great regret and shame that the new 
government has chosen to act as it has. One presumes that this action 
has been taken by an irresponsible underling of the ministry oblivious 
of the impact upon the people of the breaking of the government s 
solemn undertaking. If this government is to be trusted, its word must 
be its bond.
 Will the finance ministry explain its action to the people? 
No explanation was given. Yet again, it was established that the 
government s word is not its bond. Most of our finance ministers, 
Sartaj included, with either nothing in or on their heads, have been 
no different from the masters or mistresses they have served, all of 
whom have inevitably assumed unto themselves the powers and arrogance 
of the Sun King I am the State .
Sunday morning, November 26, 1995 A highly nervous clued-up Gujerati 
stockbroker rang (each time he opens his mouth he makes me promise 
that I will never divulge his name in print). What s happening? The 
market is crashing, has already fallen by 30 points. Have you any news 
from  Islamabad? Any heads rolled? My response You should be telling 
me rather than asking. We both soon found out.
On Saturday evening, a stockbroker on his way home from the nearby 
Stock Exchange, spotted government seals on the doors of Emirates Bank 
and armed excise policemen guarding them. Telephones buzzed all 
evening and by morning the citizens were convinced their fears had 
materialised and the government had started freezing foreign currency 
accounts. What was to follow was left to experience, foresight and 
imagination. Naturally, the stock market crashed. There was panic 
selling. The government financial institutions, managed as they are, 
could not stem the fall as they were meant to. There were no Morgans, 
Rothschilds, Sekhsarias, who in days gone by stood in the ring and 
announced, I will buy whatever whoever is selling. 
There was a run on our foreign exchange reserves. Dollars were 
remitted or withdrawn. Dollar notes had to be flown in. The 10 per 
cent import duty on cash imports, so stupidly imposed in the October 
budget, was withdrawn.
That Sunday morning, the Governor of our State Bank did not know what 
he should have known the night before that a foreign bank, Emirates 
Bank (owned by the State of Dubai and whose Board is chaired by a 
minister of the Ruler s Council), had been sealed by Assistant 
Collector of Excise Shuja-ud-din. Why? Because the bank relying upon 
High Court judgements, had refused to pay the excise duty the AC was 
attempting to extort. The helpless Governor Yaqub rang the equally 
ineffective Financial Adviser Vaseem Jafarey. They could do nothing. 
They were frozen.
And then the bell clanged and a voice from Dubai boomed and announced, 
to all intents and purposes, I am the State. (And he was). My bank 
has done no wrong. My men have abided by your laws. I too can 
administer justice in my territory as swiftly and cleanly as can 
you. The message was heard loud and clear, the government apologised, 
the doors of the bank were immediately unsealed, and Shuja-ud-din and 
his extortees were told to get lost.
However, within the space of that one day enormous damage had been 
done. Millions of our foreign currency reserves had flown. The 
fragility of our economy had been exposed.
Feeling unsafe and exercising abundant caution, counsel for Emirates 
Bank, Barrister Mohammad Gilbert Naim-ur-Rahman, filed a 
constitutional petition in the Sindh High Court. Acting Chief Justice 
Abdul Hafiz Memon stayed the excise collector s hand till the next 
date of hearing. American Express and Citibank had earlier obtained 
such orders from the High Court.
Monday, November 27 The run continued. Karachi stocks plunged to an 
all-time low. The men who rule over us sat in a cabinet and met in 
Lahore, whereafter Prime minister Benazir, Finance Minister Benazir, 
minister of State for Finance Makhdoom Shahabuddin and Financial 
Adviser Vaseem Jafarey left it to the least credible cabinet man, 
Information Kharal, to speak to the Press. His claim was that vested 
interests were spreading rumours to cause serious harm to the national 
economy in order to create panic among the people in general and 
potential investors in particular, with a view to shaking their 
confidence in Pakistan s future. But, the danger to our financial 
health had been warded off.
Kharal feels that those who do not like or approve of him and his 
fellow party people would sabotage themselves to the extent of seeing 
their own money and savings go down the drain. Who and what is Kharal?
Tuesday, November 28 The run continued. Minister of Commerce Ahmed 
Mukhtar who has extended his field of operation and has been recently 
dabbling in the field of finance collecting taxes from the textile 
mill owners and exempting ring spinning frames (SRO dated November 5, 
1995) was invited to dinner to address the members of the Karachi 
Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Not wishing to condemn without 
hearing as do some others, I went to hear him. We all lost our 
appetites.
He spoke in Punjabi-English. The people talk nonsense, said he. They 
say the Government of Pakistan is bankrupt, that it cannot pay its 
employees. Don t they know that we operate the Security Printing 
Press, that we can always print as much money as we want? A few 
million dollars may have gone out, but so what? That amount many of us 
can spend in a couple of evenings in Europe.
Wednesday, November 29 I went to the Sindh High Court where the 
petition filed by Barrister Makhdoom Ali Khan on behalf of Citibank 
was to be heard by a Division Bench headed by Justice Wajihuddin 
Ahmed. The government s lawyer was not present, the hearing was 
adjourned to December 6, and the stay extended. Assistant Collector 
Shujahuddin was in court, very proud of his having made Emirates Bank 
lose money and of his having taught them a lesson by sealing the bank.
For the lay mind, what is being adjudicated is as follows government 
had imposed excise duty on loans granted by banks to customers. The 
customers went to the High Court and obtained stay orders restraining 
the banks from making payment to the excise authorities. In many cases 
the orders clearly state that no duty be paid. However, the CBR 
directed the AC to collect. The banks say the court orders restrain 
them from making payment. AC Shuja-ud-din says he takes his orders 
from  the CBR which has directed him that all these orders expired six 
months after they were issued. The banks are in a fix. If they pay, 
they may be prosecuted for contempt if they do not pay, AC threatens 
to seal them all. No one in the government bothers to resolve the 
issue to rein in AC Shuja-ud-din or to apply to the courts for 
direction.
Corrupt, irresponsible officials endowed by non-credible rulers with 
unrestrained power easily become intoxicated by the power they wield 
(taqat ka nasha). Such men are as dangerous as swinging monkeys 
brandishing cut-throat razors.
If confidence is to be restored, the government must immediately, 
repeat immediately, announce (and abide by its undertaking) that FIA 
and Excise men such as Rehman Malik and Shuja-ud-din and their squads 
will not enter or seal or take any action against any bank without the 
express written authority of the Governor of the State Bank of 
Pakistan. No speeches or lesser measures will suffice.

<a name="anec">An economy without crutches</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed
PRIME MINISTER Benazir Bhutto is annoyed with the press for what she 
regards gross mis-reporting on the state of the economy, wild 
exaggerations of economic difficulties and denial of credit to her 
government for the economic achievements.
But while the charge of exaggeration cannot be denied in some areas, 
the fact is the fundamentals of the economy are not as sound or the 
health of the economy as good as she or her Adviser on Finance V.A. 
Jafarey claims. Indisputably Pakistan has weathered many an economic 
storm in its chequered political and economic history, and it may be 
able to survive one more, but not without some more injury to the 
economic system and more hardships to the masses.
She is also fond of stating how low was the foreign exchange reserve 
before she came to office again in October, 1993, or how empty was the 
treasury. But 1993 when we had five governments, including two care-
taker set-ups, was the year of excessive political convulsions with 
their inevitable impact on the economy as prime ministers came and 
went, or were shot out. Such a year could not become a yardstick for 
measuring the performance of her government or her successors.
Undoubtedly the economic crisis or extreme hardships which the country 
is facing today are not of her making entirely. Whether it is the 
sustained inflation, soaring national debt, worsening balance of 
payments, or the ever-shrinking rupee, it is the outcome of the 
accumulated bad policies of the past and worse official practices. But 
what required from her was urgent and comprehensive remedies to repair 
the vast damage, particularly when she continues as finance minister 
as well with the help of old advisers and young Turks, who are treated 
as economic wizards.
She has now to come up with adequate, effective and visible economy 
measures, and cut the public spending substantially. That is what the 
IMF and the State Bank of Pakistan, too, have been urging the 
government to do reduce the large budget deficit, restrain the 
mounting national debt and lower the vicious inflation.
This is an area where symbols are as important as the substance. And 
she and the President should have drastically cut down the expenditure 
on themselves, reduced the number of their ceremonial foreign visits, 
their duration and the size of their entourage which in many cases is 
common for both. They should have avoided more than doubling of their 
salaries and perquisites, and coming up with unacceptable levels of 
pensions for them. The government should have sent far fewer 
delegations abroad when their achievements are so small and their 
visits are too expensive. And size of the delegations should have been 
small and surely the new practice of sending delegates to the UN 
General Assembly every fortnight as if a relay race is on in New York 
must have been avoided.
The people groaning under the impact of rising taxation and mounting 
inflation, who are exhorted to tighten their belts too often, should 
be able to see the top people, who control our purse strings, too, are 
making some sacrifices instead of flying off too often in special 
planes while PIA complains non- payment of Rs 80 million for such VVIP 
trips.
Now can the Pakistan press be blamed for the foreign exchange reserves 
sinking within four months from 2,737 million dollars to 1,092 
million? Can it be blamed if the public sector banks and DFIs are not 
able to recover more than 15 per cent of the Rs 80 billion defaulted 
loans after 28 months, and for the default now rising to Rs 100 
billion, due to new political loans?
Can the Press be blamed for the domestic debt rising to Rs 797 
billion, marking a rise of Rs 93 billion last year and Rs 92 billion 
the year before an increase of Rs 194 billion within the two years 
of her government as the State Bank figures show? Along with that the 
foreign long and medium term debt has risen by Rs 151 billion within 
two years, making the total national debt Rs 1,465 billion which is a 
truly crushing burden for it means debt of over Rs 11,100 per capita.
The stock exchange crisis is not of the making of the Press either. 
The index of shares of the Karachi Stock Exchange has been slipping 
for the last 20 months after it reached its peak of 2,661 in March 
last year. The reasons were political, monetary, fiscal as well as the 
endless Karachi killings. The government did not give serious 
attention to the problem. Gen. Naseerullah Babar instead blamed it on 
manipulators in the KSE as if share prices in the Lahore and Islamabad 
exchanges were doing well. And to make matters worse, a 10 per cent 
tax on bonus shares was imposed under the current budget even when 
bonus shares mean re-investment which the country desperately needs 
both to accelerate industrialisation and fight inflation. As a result, 
the KSE index sunk to 1325 or a half of the peak index on November 29 
and bounced back by 100 points within three days after the PM agreed 
to meet presidents of the three exchanges to discuss the crisis. That 
shows how an earnest official action, that too at the level of the 
P.M. can produce results. Moving away from domestic comments on the 
economy to international perception, was not Pakistan s credit rating 
by the reputable Moods Investors Service, New York lowered in July 
last from BA3 to Bl? And was it not Transparency International based 
in Berlin which rated Pakistan in August as the third most corrupt 
country in the world after Indonesia and China with its new capitalist 
futures? The Pakistani delegate Mian Rafi who attended its conference 
in Manila recently said that on the basis of the quality of the 
complaints by foreign investors and specialists Pakistan should have 
been the first country, but since fewer investors had visited Pakistan 
compared to Indonesia and China, Pakistan came to have the third 
position among the corrupt.
The prestigious annual report The world in 1996 published by the 
Economist of London, cautions declining foreign exchange reserves may 
soon provide less than eight weeks-worth of import cover. It says the 
government will remain highly unpopular and talks of army intervention 
in 1996. Its other publication Asia through 2000 talks of declining 
GDP before the end of the century 4 per cent in 1998 and 3.4 in 
1999, double digit inflation until 1999, and foreign debt rising from 
29.7 per cent now to 35.8 per cent by 1999.
This is the kind of situation, along with dismal forecast for the near 
future when the population will rise to 150 million by 2000, that 
calls for urgent and adequate official action. Equally imperative is 
the closing of the gap with the people, and between the government, 
trade, industry and other economic groups, and a better equation 
between the big agriculturists and trade and industry. And it so 
postulates an early and effective end of the Karachi crisis and 
meeting the basic needs of its people instead of trying to sell them 
mega-development plans in which they have small faith.
It is no use talking of the low foreign exchange reserves of the Nawaz 
Sharif period and compare that with the present as at that time total 
foreign exchange deposits of Pakistanis, foreigners and of foreign 
banks with the State Bank were not 6.5 billion dollars against which 
the government s reserves now is only 1.1 billion dollars. In such a 
situation rumours are likely to breed. The solution was for the banks 
to be enabled to return the dollars of small depositors as they came 
to get them. Delaying repayment by two or three days aggravated the 
rumours and promoted a mini-stampede. Meanwhile foreign banks which 
brought in money from abroad to save their face and help their clients 
were charged 10 or 11 per cent tax on the cash and that precipitated a 
new crisis, following the crisis caused by the closure of Emirate Bank 
in an excise duty dispute which exposed Pakistani banks in the Gulf to 
retaliatory closure.
The PM has now ordered an enquiry into both. But does that not show 
that small men at lower levels whether in the CBR or FIA have been 
armed with vast powers and they are ready to misuse them? At a time 
when coherent and consistent official action is needed there is medley 
of misdeeds in sensitive areas.
And look at the chaos produced by the provincial governments by not 
paying the dues of federal institutions, like WAPDA and PTC and the 
Centre withholding their financial dues or deducting the bills from 
them and the provinces protesting and Sindh overdrawing Rs four 
billion from the State Bank. Similarly it is her Federal Anti-
Corruption Committee which is coming up with grave charges of vast 
corruption against federal institutions and autonomous bodies and 
feeling too frustrated as it is blocked from many quarters.
Clearly the PM has to look closer home for solutions to her economic 
problems. And her finance officials have to brief the Press in Karachi 
also instead of confining it to Islamabad, and Lahore now. Better 
information and less scolding is what the Press needs.

<a name="whos">Who s in charge anyway?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mazdak
THE drip, drip, drip you hear is the sound of the lifeblood of the 
economy draining away.
If the Karachi Stock Exchange is an indicator of the state of health 
of the economy, then we have a terminally ill patient on our hands. 
However, we have been assured by that internationally acclaimed 
capital market analyst, General Naseerullah Babar, that the collapse 
of the country s equity market is due to the manipulation by a group 
of stock brokers.
Without wishing to cast doubts on the Interior Minister s acknowledged 
expertise in high finance, I must confess to being puzzled as the 
president of the Karachi Stock Exchange has recently appealed to the 
Prime Minister to save the stock market from utter ruin. If the steep 
and unprecedented fall in share prices is indeed due to 
 manipulation , then who is benefiting and why are stock brokers 
squealing for help?
Actually, asinine statements apart, investor confidence is a fragile 
thing, based in part on economic and financial fundamentals, but 
mostly on perceptions of a non-monetary nature. These include non-
quantifiable factors like law and order, political stability, 
confidence in the government s policies and of late, the international 
financial environment.
Thus, when news of a prominent businessman s arrest breaks, the market 
reacts by shedding a few points. If, on the other hand, a tax cut is 
announced, share prices are likely to rise. Over the last year or so, 
there has been very little good news indeed, a combination of fiscal 
and psychological factors has devastated the stock exchange and ruined 
many small and big investors.
For any sane person to suggest that the equity market has been 
deliberately depressed is to reveal ignorance of truly monumental 
proportions.
Recently, millions of dollars are believed to have left the country 
from  private foreign currency accounts within a couple of days. The 
reason for this massive flight of capital is a persistent rumour that 
the government intends to freeze all or part of such accounts and 
compensate the account holders by giving them the equivalent in 
rupees.
Although the story has been forcefully denied, most people are not 
taking any chances as they point out to the fact that a large 
instalment on a foreign loan is due in December, and due to a drop in 
exports, sufficient funds are not available to service the loan. 
Clearly, since such a move would be tantamount to fiscal suicide, 
there does not appear any chance of the government going through with 
it. Nevertheless, individuals with a couple of thousand dollars as 
well as businessmen with hundreds of thousands in their bank accounts 
have so little confidence in the government that they immediately 
transferred their funds abroad.
While denying the rumour, official spokesman have suggested that it is 
the product of opposition disinformation. They may well be right, but 
the fact remains that the story was believed because of the widespread 
perception that this government is hostile towards business, apart 
from  being clue less about fiscal policy. As an example of this 
ignorance, businessmen cite the recent devaluation of the Pakistani 
rupee and the simultaneous increase in customs duties on virtually 
every imported product. Now as any student of economics will tell you, 
the whole point of devaluation is to give your exporters a competitive 
advantage over rivals.
However, in our case, the prices of raw materials and other inputs 
have been increased at the same time by jacking up customs duties, 
thus blunting any possible edge exporters might have gained, and 
producing nothing excepting to add to the already soaring inflation 
rate.
The COAS has gone on record with the statement that the defence budget 
is being severely eroded as a result of rising prices and the falling 
value of the Pakistani rupee. If this is the reality the defence 
forces with their bloated budget have to contend with, think what 
inflation is doing to the average Pakistani family. And yet, despite 
the visible political fallout of all these economic factors, there is 
a strange air of unreality about the government s response.
Sundry spokesman at every level blame the previous government for our 
pain. Again, there is some truth in this charge Nawaz Sharif s 
profligate ways have left permanent scars on the economy. But two 
years down the road, the present government should have something more 
to show than soaring prices, a falling rupee, a shattered share market 
and a complete collapse of confidence among the business community.
A major problem in formulating coherent and consistent economic 
policies is the fact that no one individual seems to be in charge. 
There is no federal finance minister as the Prime Minister has 
retained this crucial portfolio her special assistant, Shahid Hasan 
Khan, wields enormous clout which he exercises by dealing directly 
with the bureaucracy, bypassing the minister of state for finance who 
has very little to do with policy-making. Nor, indeed, does V.A. 
Jafarey who, despite having the status of a federal minister, has been 
largely marginalised.
Another heavyweight in this galaxy of experts is Qazi Alimullah, the 
hard working though plodding arch bureaucrat who was given a three-
year contract as deputy chairman of the Planning Commission despite 
being Finance Secretary when Nawaz Sharif launched his ill-fated 
Yellow Cab Scheme.
Completing this dream team is the finance secretary who is thoroughly 
disliked by the business community which views him as being hostile to 
their interests. Indeed, businessmen are seldom, if ever, consulted in 
decisions that directly affect them. Leading this motley crew is 
Benazir Bhutto in her role of finance minister.
It does not help that the business community is perceived by the 
ruling party as being pro-Nawaz Sharif. There is certainly some truth 
in this as they view the ex-prime minister as one of their own. But it 
should be remembered that entrepreneurs follow profits and if they are 
pro-PML(N), it is because they perceive it to be business-friendly.
If this government were to follow policies conducive to money-making, 
there is no reason why there should be any hostility between the two 
sides. After all, the bottom line is that what is good for General 
Motors is good for America if there is a conducive climate for 
investment, profits will be reinvested and more goods, services and 
jobs will be generated. The government s revenues will rise, the stock 
market will thrive and more investible funds will be available to 
finance new projects.
And the opposite scenario? Well, we are living through it now.

<a name="deva">Devaluation of human life</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Omar Kureishi
ALL violent deaths are wasteful. Those that are politically motivated 
are mindless and counter-productive as well. But this is well known 
and it isn't as if I have discovered some profound universal truth. It 
is well known to all except, perhaps, to those who order and commit 
murder in the name of, or on behalf of, or to further some cause, 
personal or public.
Thus one finds that writing on the subject is a total exercise in 
futility. Those one wishes to address or try to persuade are not 
likely to be swayed by reason and they seem to be people with no sense 
of humanity, no sense of the rules of life in which human beings count 
for something.
All of us, at some time, have known the pain and anguish that comes 
with the passing away of someone close whether it is a member of the 
family or a friend or even a person we have admired from a distance.
The daily statistics that appear in the newspapers of killings convey 
only the coldness of the brutal, senseless acts. These are impersonal 
deaths and tell us nothing about the victims, most importantly, do not 
bring to our attention the most notable single fact that the dead are 
someone's father, mother, brother, sister, son, daughter, that they 
belong to some household and of how that household has been broken and 
devastated, filled with sorrow. Statistics only tell us how many have 
died. The rest is left to our imagination.
I was immensely saddened to learn of the death of Syed Ehsan Ali Shah, 
gunned down in cold blood. One can discern no motive other than he was 
the brother of the Chief Minister of Sindh. The killers for the time 
being remain faceless so that the act of murder becomes a part of a 
conspiracy. Conspiracy to what purpose, for the promotion of what 
cause? Only those who ordered the killing can tell us. What about the 
killers? What manner of people are they that they can take a human 
life and not know why they are doing so?
But it is the fact that no value is attached to human life that 
baffles me. Even a soldier in battle must have some qualms out life as 
if one was crumpling a piece of paper, that, I suppose, requires a 
special kind of unfeeling and by definition is outside the pale of 
conventional morality. It is subhuman.
What I am complaining about is a dehumanised society for the hit man 
would go bankrupt if he had no client. It is the nature of the client 
that fascinates me too. What sort of person would want to settle a 
score, be it an act of personal revenge or a political statement by 
ordering the physical elimination of others? 
I next come to terrorism and to the bomb blast at the Egyptian 
Embassy. That some foreign militant group should choose to pursue 
their domestic agenda on our soil is deserving of the severest 
condemnation. Not only were Egyptian lives lost but Pakistani as well. 
I am not certain what cause they were espousing but I am certain that 
they did not advance it.
There was a time once when terrorists needed the oxygen of publicity 
to bring their grievances to the attention of the world. In a perverse 
sort of a way, there was some admiration for them because many were 
supportive of their demands or were outraged by what their people had 
suffered.
It was a kind of a cry for help. Then terrorism became an end in 
itself and mercenaries and other kinds of soldiers of fortune began to 
make a career of it. They became international hit men. The cause 
itself became bloodstained.
There is now universal revulsion for terrorism because the victims are 
invariably innocent bystanders. Once again, those who have not the 
remotest connection with the high-mindedness are the ones who get 
hurt. 
A terrible price is being paid for being innocent. Those Pakistanis 
who died in the bomb blast at the Egyptian Embassy just happened to be 
there. It was bad luck of the worst sort. But what about their 
families? 
What would they be feeling? Obviously they will have no sympathy for 
the aims and objectives of those who caused the bomb blast. It is, as 
I said at the outset, both mindless and counter- productive. It will 
not be for the first time that a public will turn hostile to a goal 
that had seemed noble because of the brutality of the means.
The world is sick of violence whether it is national or international. 
The way to change society is not to destroy it. Because if nothing is 
left, what will there be to change?
If a cause is worth dying for then one should set an example and die 
for it. Not take the lives of those who just happen to be present. How 
dangerous it has become just to remain alive!

<a name="thef">Theft & transmission losses</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
THE KESC's transmission and distribution losses are 40 per cent as 
against the Economic Survey's average of 24 per cent for the whole 
country. Addressing the officers of the BSC the other -day, Mr Ghulam 
Mustafa Khar gave a deadline of June 1996 to bring down these losses 
to the level of the existing average for Pakistan. The minister seems 
unconvinced that more than half of these losses are due to theft. The 
officials were warned that the reduction in losses should not be 
achieved through inflated bills instead, corruption and power theft 
need to be eliminated.
The magnitude of theft can be gauged from the fact that the KESC 
itself claimed recently that in a few localities it had detected 5,560 
kundas supplying power to 8,150 households. If these households were 
consuming the minimum of 50 units each, the KESC was losing Rs 400,000 
each month in only a few localities of this mega city. The losses of 
this order are as shocking as they are baffling, especially when the 
KESC claims to be currently spending Rs 38 billion on the system-
improvement projects. Because of this heavy expenditure, one can 
understand the shortage of cash but not the increase in losses on 
account of transmission and distribution faults.
For corruption and inefficiency of the KESC administration, consumers 
are required to pay highly inflated bills. To this aspect the minister 
was totally indifferent. Within the last few months the charges have 
increased two-fold or threefold, depending upon the units of 
electricity consumed by households and industries. In case of the 
consumption of about 500 units, almost equal to half of the energy 
charges is added as fuel-adjustment charge and a full hundred per cent 
is levied as an additional surcharge. The total bill thus comes to 
about 200 per cent more than the actual price of the electricity 
consumed. Despite these heavy charges, the KESC does not have meter 
readers, for bills are made out, for months together, on the basis of 
average, which is another way of over-charging on the basis of 
graduated tariff slabs.
While the minister has delivered usual exhortation to the officers to 
reduce losses on account of theft and transmission shortcomings, he 
has not paid any attention to the plight of the consumers in relation 
to over-pricing. Two or three-fold increases in power charges must 
have upset the viability of many an enterprise, especially those in 
whose cost energy forms a major constituent. As 35 to 40 per cent of 
Pakistan's industry is located in Karachi, the KESC must be 
contributing substantially to inflation, entirely because of its 
corruption and inefficiency within its fold. With the spiralling of 
charges without any restraint or rational consideration, there will be 
no pressure on the KESC bosses either to reduce corruption or improve 
efficiency because the balance sheet would now automatically turn from 
red into black. If anything, it would encourage inefficiency if not 
corruption. Had the minister prohibited any increase in tariff until 
theft was reduced and power loss was brought down to the national 
average, the KESC would have been under pressure to make some serious 
efforts to improve efficiency and cut losses to the maximum extent 
possible.

<a name="pray">Praying for Pakistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hafizur Rahman
SUPPOSE the Pakistani nation refuses to lift even a little finger to 
rectify matters in the country, but the leaders, both in the 
government and the opposition, go regularly to Makkah and Madina to 
pray for its unity, integrity and safety, will Allah be moved by their 
prayers and grant these three gifts as a special favour?
We are taught that the Almighty s ways are inscrutable, and that no 
one can claim to understand why he punishes some and rewards others 
why apparently saintly men and women suffer and obviously evil men and 
women flourish. But there is also such a thing as common-sense with 
which he has adorned the human mind.
This common-sense tells us, that unless we make an effort to put the 
daily morsel of food into our mouths, He is not going to do it for us 
and we can starve to death, howsoever pious we may otherwise be.
Similarly, unless we do something positive and concrete for our 
country, and do it honestly, to improve our ways, Allah is not likely 
to underwrite our continuation as a nation just because we are 
Muslims.
You will be surprised to know that too many people in Pakistan believe 
that this country is specially favoured by God, and that is why we are 
still there despite our sins (and crimes) of omission and commission. 
The question is how long is He going to tolerate our bad, sinful and 
criminal ways?
For there is no doubt now that, morally and spiritually, we have all 
but reached the nadir of degradation and depravity, as much in our 
thinking as in our utterances and deeds.
It is the universal view, within the country and outside, that there 
are no decent values and noble standards left, and that corruption, 
both intellectual and financial, has taken over from all praiseworthy 
traditions and practices.
Prayer is supposed to be a strictly private communion between man and 
his Maker. Why do pressmen have to be told of its contents? Must 
praying for Pakistan be publicised to show that this is what we are 
doing for our motherland? It is as if Speaker Gilani was saying, I 
have today prayed for the safety and security of Pakistan. Everything 
will be OK now. Don t worry. 
When Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Leader of the Opposition Nawaz 
Sharif perform umra, or raise their hands in devotion at various 
shrines, do they purposely go there to seek the Almighty s protection 
and benediction for Pakistan? Is that their only intention to ask him 
to guard the country against disruption, disunity and disintegration? 
Nothing else?
I am sorry, but I refuse to believe that if they say so. Everyone of 
us bows before Allah for his personal and private needs, whether this 
bowing in prayer is in the privacy of one s home or under the glare of 
TV lights in holy places.
And yet, despite their prayerful whinings, Pakistan continues to 
degenerate, and Pakistanis have allowed their morals to deteriorate 
faster than the speed of sound. Why? One doesn t have to be specially 
holy to divine the ways of God. Prayers have to be accompanied by good 
actions, noble deeds and sincerity of purpose before they can be 
expected to show results. Remember the childhood lesson God helps 
those who help themselves.
If the action is not there, prayers are just insincere cries in the 
wilderness and as meaningless as the one I heard the imam of our local 
mosque send up one Friday Ya Allah! forgive all the sins and 
trespasses of all Muslims all over the world, dead or alive! 
I can t say anything about the Muslims who are dead, but the maulvi 
can be asked, Will Allah forgive the sins and trespasses of the 
living if they are doing nothing to become better Muslims? Are you 
implying that they should go on having a jolly good (and sinful) time 
and God should go on overlooking their misdeeds? Is this what you 
understand by God being particularly favourable towards the adherents 
of Islam? 
All that I say is pray for Pakistan if you must if you feel an 
inward urge to do so. But, for God s sake do something useful and 
practical for the country too.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="ijaz">Ijaz s unbeaten century lifts Pakistan batting</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
SYDNEY, Nov. 30 For the first time in the series Pakistan s tamed 
batting line-up stood to the test courageously to make an impressive 
231 for 4 on the first day of the third and final Test against 
Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
For this they owe a lot to their replacement batsman Ijaz Ahmed who 
scored a flawless unbeaten century (101) to lift them after Pakistan 
had won the toss and started poorly, losing their first wicket of 
Aamir Sohail on only the third delivery of the day.
Having come in to face the new ball, Ijaz seldom flattered in his stay 
of over six hours on the crease in which he hit thirteen glorious 
boundaries and two towering sixes of Mark Waugh and Shane Warne. His 
fifty came in 176 minutes batting with four boundaries and a six and 
his third century against Australia at the fag-end of the day in 348 
minutes batting.
For a player who had been forced into oblivion after the Test series 
in Zimbabwe early this year, this surely was a great comeback innings 
and a mind-boggling for those who still fail to understand or discover 
as to why he was banished from the scene and not considered against 
Sri Lanka at home despite his 246 runs in the series against Zimbabwe 
at an average of 49.50.
There was no doubt in the fact that he was at the wrong end of a dicey 
decision by Darrell Hair in the second innings of the second Test. He 
batted defiantly in the first innings there and his cool and 
calculated innings at the SCG had all the hallmark of a fully 
committed person who was there to prove something not only to the 
Australians but to his folks who for some dubious reasons had made him 
a scapegoat.
It sounds strange that he was not even allowed to play for his 
employers in Pakistan and yet suddenly was rushed back to Australia to 
strengthen a rather rickety batting line-up.
To acclimatise and elevate himself in such a brief period and then 
rise to the call is indeed creditable and he deserves every bit of it. 
The manner in which he steered Pakistan to a respectable score was 
cheerfully applauded by a crowd of over 11,000. Drives and cuts flowed 
from  his bat once he got into his grooves and even Shane Warne who 
spun the ball viciously was not much of a problem for him.
Winning the toss, Pakistan opted to bat and lost the wicket of Aamir 
Sohail when the first day s play started after a fifteen-minute delay 
because of rain. It was a careless shot by Aamir Sohail who edged 
Craig McDermott into the third slip to Mark Waugh on the third ball of 
the day when 4.
Ramiz Raja batted steadily for his 33 runs but was out to a poor shot 
when he lobbed a long-hop to mid-on to Michael Slater off Warne, 
minutes before lunch but not before he had put on 60 for the second 
wicket with Ijaz Ahmed. In the second session 79 runs were added with 
Pakistan losing one more wicket that of Inzamam-ul-Haq who in 96 
minutes stay had scored 39 runs to put on 77 for the third wicket. 
Inzamam s was an impressive innings which was cut short by Warne who 
had him caught at the wicket by Ian Healy.
Ijaz continued to dominate the proceedings even with Salim Malik at 
the wicket who had joined him. The two shared a stand of 69 for the 
fourth wicket before it ended. Malik looked in good shape. In one over 
from  Glen McGrath he hit three fours past the cover region but was out 
leg before to him when 36. Having put on 21 runs for the fifth wicket 
with Basit Ali Ijaz saw the day off without any further damage.

SYDNEY After their 2-0 drabbing of Pakistan in the current Test 
series and their win in the series against the West Indies early this 
year, Australia can now claim to be the champions of this game at Test 
level and they deserve what they have achieved in the last few years.
They not only owe this distinction to their master batsman Allan 
Border who led them in 93 Tests (a record) but also to the efforts to 
their dedicated and devoted cricketers like David Boon, Waugh 
brothers, Steve and Mark, Ian Healy, Craig McDermott and Shane Warne 
and of course their present leader Mark Taylor who is well backed by a 
qualified physio and an experienced coach, Bobby Simpson.
Their run of successes continues with the recent mauling of a 
disjoined Pakistan touring team.
Australia has now taken the reins. How long they will manage to remain 
on top will now depend on how quickly the other teams recover to be 
level again and how long their form lasts.

<a name="waug">Waughs dig in as Pakistan s batting crumbles again</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SYDNEY, Dec. 1 Mark and Steve Waugh dug in for a nervous Australian 
side after Shane Warne had sparked another dramatic Pakistan collapse 
on the second day of the third Test here Friday.
Pakistan lost their last six wickets for 68 - the last four wickets in 
19 balls - and were all out for 299. But Michael Slater went in the 
first over before Australia recovered to 151-3 when bad light stopped 
play an hour ahead of schedule.
Mark Waugh was on 54 his 21st test half century and three runs short 
of his top score on his home Sydney Cricket Ground and Steve on 26 
in an unfinished 60-run stand for the fourth wicket.
Australia, with the series already won after substantial wins in 
Brisbane and Hobart, lost skipper Mark Taylor for 47 soon after tea 
when he was out to an wild shot at off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq. His 
135 minute innings ended when he was snapped up by wicketkeeper Rashid 
Latif leaving his team shaky at 91 for three.
David Boon, the second man out, was unconvincing during his 79 minutes 
at the crease before he edged leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed to Latif to be 
out for 16.
Slater repeated his first over Hobart test flop when he was dismissed 
off the third ball of Wasim Akram s opening over for one as Australia 
had to negotiate two testing overs before lunch.
Wasim Akram clipped Slater s off-stump with an in-swinger as the 
impetuous Australian opener attempted to drive to claim his 279th 
wicket in tests.
Pakistan crumbled again fell to the spin of Shane Warne who took four 
wickets for 55 off 34 overs.
It was another shameful display by the Pakistan batsmen, saved by Ijaz 
Ahmed s 137 the highest score by a Pakistani at the SCG. His 442-
minute innings was ended when he hoisted a Shane Warne ball to Glenn 
McGrath at backward square leg.
Ijaz, who came to the crease after only two minutes into the test, 
faced 332 deliveries, hit two sixes and 17 boundaries. Ijaz was 
dropped by Mark Waugh at second slip off Craig McDermott when on 104 
in the second over of the morning.
McDermott took three wickets for 62. Warne now has 191 test wickets 
and McDermott 276.
Basit Ali, who cracked a sizzling off drive off Paul Reiffel, was out 
for 17 when he found Slater at extra cover.
Latif lasted 10 balls before he prodded at McDermott and offered a 
catch to Ian Healy to be on his way for one, sending the tourists to 
269 for six.
Pakistani skipper Wasim Akram ripped into McDermott s 21st over, 
hitting four fours in five balls.
Wasim had a life on 18 when he hooked McGrath to long-off where Slater 
scurrying in the direction of the ball dropped a two-handed chance.
Mushtaq Ahmed lasted three balls and spinning partner Saqlain Mushtaq 
four balls before Wasim was deceived by a slower delivery from McGrath 
and spooned the ball back to him to be caught and bowled for 21.

<a name="paki">Pakistan takes lead in test but falter in 2nd innings</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
SYDNEY, Dec.2 There doesn t seem to be any light at the end of the 
tunnel for Pakistan in the third and final Test being played at the 
SCG. Their bowlers sweated and clinched the initiative and their 
batsmen then destroyed it all and let every opportunity slip through 
their imprudent attitude.
The story was much the same even in the third day s play of the Test 
in which two leg spinners Mushtaq Ahmed and Shane Warne dominated the 
proceedings. Mushtaq once again weaving his web around the Australian 
batsmen had provided Pakistan with this golden opportunity of a 42-run 
first innings lead. His five for 95 in Australia s 257 all out was a 
type of performance which Wasim Akram s men badly needed to lift them 
up but in the end he alongwith his captain, who had taken 4 for 50, 
were let down by reckless batting by Pakistan.
An overall lead of 143 with six wickets remaining is not a healthy 
score, considering that Aamir Sohail, Ramiz Raja, Ijaz Ahmed and Basit 
Ali are all gone. Basit s dismissal, on the last ball of the day when 
he padded the ball from Warne pitched outside the leg stump and was 
bowled round his legs, sent shock waves in the dressing room.
Of the recognised batsmen only Salim Malik who was at the crease with 
21 and Inzamam-ul-Haq who did not take the field all day because of 
stiff neck were left to save a sinking ship. If the two manage to 
share a long partnership and Wasim Akram and Rashid Latif make useful 
contributions to enhance the lead by another hundred runs and over, 
Pakistan then may have some hope to make Australia struggle for runs.
The disturbing factor for Pakistan however is Shane Warne, who has the 
ability to spin the ball on a marble let alone on a wicket which is 
already turning square. To add to his 4 for 55 he is hungry for more.
In the second over of the Pakistan innings, Aamir Sohail was dropped 
in the first slip by Mark Taylor of all the people when he slashed at 
a Craig McDermott delivery. In the next over, Aamir hooked Glen 
McGrath for 6 to mid-wicket. But he chanced his arm once too often and 
was caught by David Boon at point off McDermott when 9. It was slip-
shod batting.
Having added 16 runs to their tea score of 42, Pakistan lost Ijaz 
Ahmed for 15 after 40 runs were added for the second wicket. Warnes 
top spinner wrapped him in front of the wicket. Ramiz Raja swept Warne 
when 39 and failed as the ball seemingly brushing his gloves lobbed in 
the air to be caught by Mark Waugh.
Salim Malik showed a lot of resilience occupying the crease for 76 
minutes for his 21 to keep his end intact but saw Basit perish at the 
other end.
The Waugh brothers who earlier in the morning had resumed at 151 for 
3, were separated after an 83 runs partnership for the fourth wicket. 
Steve Waugh was beaten off Mushtaq and was smartly stumped by Rashid 
Latif for 38.
Greg Blewett had no clue against Mushtaq s googly and was bowled when 
5. But Mark Waugh who had started the day at 54 stayed there to reach 
his century in 239 minutes batting with six fours and a six off 
Saqlain Mushtaq.
from 226 at lunch, Australia crashed to 257 all out fifty minutes 
after lunch. Mushtaq who had Ian Healy caught at the wicket before 
lunch took a well judged catch in the gully off Wasim Akram to dismiss 
Mark Waugh for 116. Akram then had Warne caught by Rashid for 2 and 
bowled McDermott in the same over - taking two wickets in three balls.
A low down catch by Akram at cover off caused McGrath dismissal thus 
enabling Pakistan to be in the lead which was enjoyable.

<a name="sydn">Sydney Test set for tight finish</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
SYDNEY, Dec. 4 For Pakistan or for Australia it is going to be a very 
crucial final day tomorrow in the third Test being played at the SCG. 
As it is poised, it can go either way. A win for Australia would mean 
a clean sweep in the series against the tourists and for Pakistan the 
victory would mean a lot more than a win. It will at least give them 
some credibility and confidence before they start their three-week 
tour of New Zealand.
Needing 247 runs to take the match and with it achieve a whitewash in 
the series, Australia are precariously placed at 121 for 3 having lost 
Michael Slater, David Boon and their century-maker of the first 
innings Mark Waugh. They still require 126 more runs on a wicket on 
which it is not easy to bat against spinners Mushtaq Ahmed but not 
difficult either, if Mark Taylor, who is there with 49, and the rest 
stick to their task to wait, stay and graft the required runs.
Pakistan resuming at their overnight 101 for 4 with Inzamam and Salim 
Malik together took the score to 163 before Malik who had batted 
responsibly was given out leg before by Dickie Bird when 45. It was a 
close decision after Malik had added 62 runs for the fifth wicket with 
Inzamam and had batted for 192 minutes in a bid to take a sizeable 
lead. From 117 for 5 at lunch Pakistan should have been able to take a 
big lead but they did not as once again their batting faltered and a 
collapse ensued.
Inzamam 45 at lunch completed his 50 with six fours in nearly two 
hours batting but then saw wickets tumble. Wasim Akram was leg before 
to a dicey decision by Steve Randall when McDermott brushed his top 
end of his pads.
Rashid Latif was another unlucky man to be declared leg before to a 
delivery from Warne which had pitched outside the leg stump when he 
was 3. Bird s blunders were innumerable but this was a stunner.
Taylor s superb catch at mid-wicket off a McDermott delivery to get 
rid of Inzamam was a brilliant piece of work when Inzamam had scored 
59. McDermott later had Saqlain and Mushtaq Ahmed in his next over to 
wrap up the innings and finish with 5 for 49.

SYDNEY, Dec. 4 The victory against Australia by 74 runs in the third 
and final Test at the Sydney cricket ground today couldn t have come 
at a better time, that is just a day before the team leaves for New 
Zealand for a one-off Test and four limited - over games.
The Pakistani team deservingly earned a success after their successive 
defeats in the first two Tests at Brisbane and Hobart, and the 
humiliation against Sri Lanka at home. The triumph would go a long way 
to boost the confidence of the Pakistanis and to reorganise 
themselves.
The fans may be having a different view of the series had Pakistan not 
dropped nine catches in the first Test at Brisbane and had the 
umpiring, which has been grossly inconsistent in the series, not 
played its part in Pakistan s stumble in the second Test at Hobart.
But this is all part of this glorious game of uncertainties. One could 
pontificate and hypothesise but the truth of the matter is that the 
series is over and Australia has won it 2-1, thus dashing any 
aspirations that Pakistan had of winning a series Down Under. But 
Pakistan s fourth Test victory in Australia and their first after 
their last win in Melbourne in 1981-82 in this country, was well 
deserved.
Pakistan s captain Wasim Akram cannot be blamed for moaning that the 
series should have been a five - match contest. Obviously not happy 
with the umpiring in the series he said, I am not allowed to comment 
on umpiring decisions but we will in the usual manner submit a report 
to the ICC. 
Given recent history of the Australians, the run chase of 247 to win 
was though approachable was demanding.
The Test at the start of the day was evenly poised and opened and any 
one could have snatched it. Pakistan was lucky that they made early 
inroads and continued to put pressure once they had tightened their 
grip over the Australian middle order and the tail.
With only ten minutes to go to lunch on the final day, Pakistan had 
completed their demolition job, taking the remaining seven wickets and 
not allowing any mercy. For this leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed who had a 
haul of 9 wickets for 186 in the match was as much responsible as 
Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis who struck the final blow by taking three 
wickets to polish off the tail.
In the third over of the day, Ian Healy, the night-watchman edged one 
from  Akram to Rashid Latif when 7. Taylor who earlier on had reached 
his fifty with five fours in 169 minutes batting, drove dangerously 
past Mushtaq s stretching hands for four to long on.
Both he and Steve Waugh, who was batting with a runner because of a 
groin injury were never at ease as Mushtaq and Akram kept them 
guessing with superb bowling, the former with his shrewd spinners, the 
latter with swinging deliveries.
Driving Mushtaq, Waugh played onto his wicket when 14 and six runs 
later Taylor ran out of steam to be stumped by Rashid Latif for 59.
Waqar Younis brought into the attack then bowled Greg Blewett with a 
full toss when 14 and shattered Craig McDermott s stumps in the same 
over.
The collapse continued as Shane Warne hit one of Mushtaq at long off 
and Saqlain Mushtaq took it comfortably. A few deliveries later Waqar 
delivered a scorcher to overthrow Glen McGrath for 0.
 Making runs in the second innings was hard work. Pakistan bowled 
tight and deserved to win. Shane Warne was the Man of the Series for 
his 19 wickets and Mushtaq Ahmed, the Man of the Match.

<a name="mush">Mushtaq emerges as potential challenger</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
SYDNEY, Dec. 5 Australian leg-spinner Shane Warne is facing a new 
challenge his status as the ultimate match-winner for any cricket 
Test side is under threat from Pakistan counterpart Mushtaq Ahmed.
Warne, Australia s most prolific bowler in recent years, earned the 
man-of-the-series award by capturing 19 Pakistan wickets as Australia 
beat Pakistan 2-1 in the three-Test series.
But the bowler who revived the art of leg-spin has found himself 
challenged by the diminutive Mushtaq, whose nine-wicket match haul 
helped lift Wasim Akram s side to a 74-run victory in the third Test 
on Monday.
His victims at the Sydney Cricket Ground included Warne, who looked as 
confused and baffled as the other Australian batsmen by Mushtaq s 
ability to disguise a delivery that spins back into the right-hander.
Warne, in contrast, can produce sharper turn away from a right-hander 
with his standard leg-break delivery in an arsenal further 
strengthened by his flipper.
Warne, the stockier and more experienced of the leg-spin pair, 
eventually lost his wicket for five after lofting a mis-timed drive to 
Saqlain Mushtaq at mid-off.
Mushtaq s man-of-the-match performance, which took his tally for the 
series to 18, earned glowing praise from Wasim, who bracketed the 
right-arm spinner in the same class as Warne.
Mushtaq was overlooked for the first Test in Brisbane, won 
convincingly by Australia, while Warne did not bowl in either Pakistan 
innings in the second Test in Hobart, also won by the home side, after 
breaking his toe late on the first day.
Mushtaq, who attributed some of the credit for his performance to 
Warne s influence, said he is playing his best cricket at the moment.
 Shane is one of the best bowlers in the world because of one thing 
he never gives the batsman a chance to hit the ball because his line 
is very good and he is very consistent, Mushtaq said in a post-match 
interview.
 I learned one thing from him I get a bit excited because I have not 
got great patience, but he has great patience. So that is what I tried 
to do, he said.
Warne finished the series with 19 wickets for 198 runs at an average 
of 10.42, compared with Mushtaq s 18 for 384 runs at 21.33.
Warne has 195 wickets in 41 Tests while Mushtaq has 62 from 20.
The figures are enough to make any Test batsman nervous, particularly 
as both Warne and Mushtaq are some years away from what is regarded as 
a spin bowler s prime.

<a name="jans">Jansher stretched but overcomes challenge</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
DOHA (Qatar), Nov. 30 Pakistan s world champion Jansher Khan needed 
all his experience to overcome the challenge of 20-year- old 
Australian Dan Jenson in the quarter-finals of the Qatar International 
Squash Championship here on Thursday.
It was only in the third game that Jansher was able to assert his 
authority and won 17-15, 17-15, 15-8 after 54 minutes, with the first 
game occupying almost half this time.
Jenson, ranked 33 in the world and playing in his first- ever major 
quarter-final, used his height and long reach to take the ball early 
and whenever he got an opening, finished the ball with a fine touch.
Although Jansher was never behind, he was never able to get more than 
two points ahead of the Australian in the first game and Jenson saved 
a game point to stretch it into setting.
In the second Jenson had a useful lead of 6-2, but then played a 
couple of high-risk shots which finished up on the tin and started 
Jansher on the road to recovery.
But again Jenson did not let him get far in front and was level with 
him at 13. Once more he saved a game point with a deft drop- shot, but 
could not make the most of his reprieve.
In the third Jansher applied tremendous pressure and his young 
opponent s control faltered. Once he was cushioned with a sizeable 
lead, Jansher himself played some daring shots from overhead and 
Jenson s challenge collapsed, the final game taking only ten minutes.
Australian Brett Martin, the fourth-seeded Australian, beat Del 
Harris, the English finalist in the recent World Open Championship, in 
a spectacular match lasting 42 minutes.
The issue was settled in straight games but fortunes fluctuated 
incessantly and each of the games could have gone either way.
Martin s ability to score winners from seemingly impossible angles and 
the element of deception in his strokes tipped the scales.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
DOHA, Dec. 1 Australia s Rodney Eyles lived up to his number two 
world ranking by qualifying for the final of the Qatar International 
Squash Championship with a win over compatriot Brett Martin here on 
Friday.
The semi-final, lasting 62 minutes, was a thriller because it was 
closely-contested and had spectacular rallies. Although competition 
was keen, the match was played in excellent spirit and with both 
rivals moving superbly on court, lets were down to a minimum.
The crowd, often brought to its feet by the Australians dazzling 
display, groaned with disappointment when Martin failed to stretch the 
match to a fifth game.
Pakistan s six-times world champion Jansher Khan beat Scotland s Peter 
Nicol 15-12, 15-12, 17-15 in 58 minutes to set up a final against 
Eyles on Sunday.
Jansher s concentration seemed to lapse each time he had a sizeable 
lead in the third game. He had four match points at 14-10 and though 
Nicol saved it with a tight drop, the Pakistani then made errors to 
let Nicol draw level at 14-14.
As for Nicol, he played with persistence but without being able to 
exert much authority. He was the last man to beat Jansher on the 
international circuit in the Leekes Welsh Classic in February 1994.
 No matter how well you are playing, he can go one better. It is very 
frustrating, said the third seed after losing 15-12 15-12 17-15.
Results in the Qatar International Squash Championship here on Friday

<a name="four">Fourth successive Qatar Open crown for Jansher</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
DOHA, Dec. 2 World champion Jansher Khan won the Qatar International 
Championship for the fourth year running with an emphatic win over the 
World number two from Australia Rodney Eyles.
Jansher had the match sewn up in 58 minutes, 15-4, 15-9, 17-16. He 
came from behind to win the third game but his recovery was quite 
effortless, rattling off five points in a row after Eyles had served 
for the game at 14-9. Jansher saved another game point over setting, 
at 16-15. Initially Jansher was 3-7 behind in that game.
There was promise of the second game being fought more closely when 
the rivals were level at seven. But a tinned shot by Eyles started the 
opening of the gap, with Jansher either hitting winners or forcing 
Eyles into errors.
Jansher was both erratic and loose at the start of the third and 
continued to fritter away points till Eyles led 12-7. Two forehand 
kills which ended successive points, followed by an error from Eyles 
gave him temporary relief.
But then Eyles responded with two winners in succession, a drop and a 
boast, which took him to game point. Jansher, however, closed in on 
him with three successive winners, the first two being volley-drops.
On his fourth game point, a frustrated Eyles drummed the tin with his 
return of service and a mis-aimed drop put Jansher level. A penalty 
point gave Eyles his last chance of salvaging the game.
But Jansher deprived him with a volley that died in the back of the 
court and seized the last point with a flourish, hitting a winning 
backhand.</pre>
