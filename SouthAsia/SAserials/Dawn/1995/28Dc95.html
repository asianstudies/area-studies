<a name="sixt">Sixteen killed and six terrorists arrested</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

Terrorists shot dead sixteen people raising the months death toll to 
79. Five people with different ethnic backgrounds were kidnapped, 
tortured and killed in Korangi while two mutilated bodies were found 
and three MQM workers died in shootout.

A MQM labour wing activist, who was arrested by the CIA but later 
released when his family was allegedly made to pay bribes, died from 
torture wounds.

Shahid Dehlavi, was arrested by CIA Inspector Chaudhry Bakhtawar, 
during a raid on KESC head office on Dec. 13.
    
His relatives claimed that Shahid Dehlavi was subjected to severe 
torture during interrogation at the CIA Centre in Saddar. Finally on 
Dec. 16, CIA Karachi released him after allegedly taking a bribe of Rs 
135,000.
    
His family was asked to take Shahid out of Karachi but it should not 
leave the boundaries of Sindh.

The family claimed that during interrogation the CIA police broke the 
knees and shoulders of Shahid and damaged his lungs and one of the 
kidneys. He also received several other internal injuries which caused 
his death.

In another incident a 35-year-old MQM ex-councillor, who had been in 
hiding, died in a mysterious encounter with the police in Orangi.

ALTAFS REACTION: The MQM chief, Altaf Hussain, has condemned the 
murders.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Dec. 21: Leader of MQM, Altaf Hussain condemned the arrests of 
innocent people in Hyderabad by the police and the Rangers.

In a statement he accused the Government that after Karachi it has now 
made Hyderabad a target and is using the full state power against 
people by raiding their houses.
    
He said that the MQM is fully aware of the use of sheer power being 
used by the law enforcement agencies and has prepared its own plan of 
action. He appealed to his supporters to wait for his call.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

HYDERABAD, Dec. 21: The Haq Parast members of Hyderabad in the Sindh 
Assembly, Maqbool Qureshi, Zafar Rajput and Mubin Sheikh, have called 
on international human rights organisations to visit Hyderabad and 
Latifabad, meet the people and see for themselves the state 
brutalities unleashed there.
    
The MPAs alleged that the police pickets had been set-up on high rise 
buildings which had affected the privacy of the people, and the 
personnel deployed at the pickets were allegedly indulging in immoral 
activities.
    
The Hyderabad-based MPAs deplored that on the one hand, police were 
patronising criminals while on the other innocent people were being 
booked. They observed that if these atrocities were allowed to 
continue, the protest by the Haq Parast people is quite justified.
    
The release said that owing to the police action, business activities 
had come to a standstill.

<a name="cond">Altaf condemns Orangi siege and arrests</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

LONDON, Dec. 22: Arrests made on a large scale by the Rangers and the 
police in Orangi town during a siege have been strongly condemned by 
the MQM leader, Mr Altaf Hussain who described the action as blatant 
fascism on the part of the Bhutto government.

Mr Hussain said that law enforcement agencies surrounded several 
localities in Orangi town and broke open several houses. According to 
him, at least 10,000 people were detained and were later moved to open 
ground and made to sit there in the cold while 200 were transferred to 
some unknown place.

The MQM leader said that when those arrested were released they were 
beaten up by the security forces who also entered some of the houses 
and maltreated the women. He said such sieges were unprecedented and 
have become a routine.

He appealed to patriotic Pakistanis and national leaders to notice the 
harassment of Mohajirs by the government agencies. Mr Hussain asked if 
such atrocities were committed against other communities what would 
have been their reaction. He said it was their duty not only to 
protest against the government but to actively campaign against the 
authorities.

Blast condemned: In another statement, Mr Hussain expressed his 
sympathies with those who have lost their family members in the 
Peshawar bomb blast. He described it as the worst kind of terrorism 
which has to be strongly condemned. Mr Hussain said the PPP 
government is incompetent and having failed to protect the lives of 
the people of Pakistan has lost its right to govern.

<a name="isht">Ishtiaq urges visiting of Adiyala Jail</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 22: MQM Coordination Committee Convenor Senator Ishtiaq 
Azhar has urged Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad to help constitute a 
committee of Senate members and help the committee members get 
permission to visit the Adiyala Jail, Rawalpindi, so that the nation 
and the world could know about the torture being inflicted on the 
interned workers and leaders of the MQM and of the Muttahida Qaumi 
Movement.

In a statement he said now to conceal the acts of barbarism in the 
jail the government is trying to prevent them from attending the Sindh 
Assembly winter session. The government is afraid that if these 
interned legislators are brought out of jail, the world would know the 
tale of the macabre happenings in the jail.

Mohammad Aslam, brother-in-law of MQM chief Altaf Hussain, is 
seriously ill in jail, but despite physicians advice he is not being 
transferred to hospital. The government has also been maintaining 
silence about the internment of Shazia Farooq and Raees Fatima. The 
government has not explained for what crimes they have been jailed and 
why their arrests had been kept a secret for more than five months. In 
the Adiyala Jail such severe torture was inflicted on MPAs Waseem 
Akhtar and Rana Safdar that their lives are threatened, Senator Azhar 
deplored.

<a name="faro">Farooq says hundreds of MQM workers missing</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 26: MQM parliamentary leader in the Sindh Assembly Dr 
Farooq Sattar said that hundreds of MQM workers were still missing 
since their arrest, but the government had been denying their arrest.

At least 10 workers, he said, who were picked up by law enforcers in 
the interior of Sindh and Karachi, were detained in various police 
stations and jails. He cited the names of these workers.

He said  that on each arrest, the MQM had sent telegrams and letters 
to the President, the Prime Minister, the Federal Interior Minister, 
the Sindh governor and the chief minister and judges of the Sindh High 
Court and appealed them to intervene and save the lives of these 
workers but to no avail.

He said at least 5,000 workers were still languishing in jails but 
since they had not been produced in any court so far as the 
prosecution branch had failed in framing charges against any of them. 
He said some of them who had been detained under charges of 
kidnapping, rioting and carrying prohibited bore weapons with them had 
not been granted bail.

After a bitter experience in lower courts, he said, the MQM had filed 
a number of petitions in the Sindh High Court but to no avail. He said 
that in the view of unfair treatment meted out to the people, the year 
1995 was the worst year in Pakistans judicial history "because courts 
have not taken any notice of unfairness and high-handedness of the 
administration."

Mr Sattar also urged the government to shift all those detainees back 
to their city jails who had been moved into the far-flung jails in the 
interior of Sindh some months back and provision of medical aid to 
detainees, particularly Anees Qaimkhani and Mohammah Aslam, was also 
requested by him.

He also requested that detainees be tried in open courts, and all 
special courts be disbanded and independence of the judiciary  
restored.   In his appeal to the judges of the superior courts, Mr 
Sattar said if MQM demands were not repugnant to the law, these must 
be accepted.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz offers dialogue but puts poll condition</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 21: Leader of the opposition Nawaz Sharif said that 
the opposition was willing to engage in a political dialogue with the 
government provided the government first agreed to the holding of 
early elections.
    
The oppositions demand, however, was rejected within minutes of the 
conclusion of Nawazs speech by a somewhat agitated looking law 
minister who wound up the debate for the treasury. Summarily 
dismissing Nawaz Sharifs frustrating tale of woes, N.D Khan made a 
categorical announcement on behalf of his government, insisting that 
there will be no early polls and elections will only be held in 
November 1998.
    
The leader of the oppositions concluding speech on the presidential 
address mentioned that the matters had gone far beyond the talking 
stage now and for any meaningful results, the government must first 
realise the inevitability of seeking a fresh mandate from the people.
    
Warning that the country was sitting atop a debt time bomb, Nawaz 
painted a grim economic scenario for the country. According to his 
projections the country was presently spending Rs 156 billion on debt 
servicing, which comes to 62 per cent of government revenues, a 
figure he believed would cross the 70 per cent mark. With factories 
closing down, economy in the pits where is this money going to come 
from?, he asked.
    
He alleged that the governments misdirected economic policies had 
already resulted in the closure of over 4000 industrial units with 
more joining the queue every day. He claimed that even those still 
operating were only operating at 30 per cent capacity.
    
Hammering upon the economic theme, Nawaz pointed out that the 4 per 
cent GDP growth rate for the past three years was the lowest in 
Pakistans history and compared to the 3 per cent annual increase in 
population, it only proves a reversal of growth.
    
Claiming that inflation was running as high as 30 per cent, he said 
that fresh investment in the country had stopped while the existing 
capital was also flowing out. He said that exports were down by 8 per 
cent while imports had increased in the same period by 24 per cent, 
foreign exchange reserves had dwindled down to dollar one billion from 
an earlier US dollar 2.5 billion and even this figure is inclusive of 
the 900 million earned from the PTC share sales.
    
He criticised the government for wasting crores on meaningless media 
publicity campaigns, foreign junkets while the ordinary man bore the 
brunt of economic hardship.

MIRPURKHAS, Dec. 22: The Pakistan Muslim League (N) of Mirpurkhas has 
demanded that Nawaz Sharif immediately suspend the divisional 
president of the party Pir Noor Muhammad Shah Jilani who had created 
disputes and differences among the party workers.

The meeting of workers of PML-N chaired by Abdul Majeed unanimously 
announced the launch of a protest campaign against the divisional 
president Pir Noor Muhammad Shah Jilani.

The meeting demanded that Nawaz Sharif immediately take notice of this 
matter and appoint honest workers as office bearers and end the 
differences between the local office bearers.

Staff Correspondent

HYDERABAD, Dec. 23: The Sindh general secretary of Pakistan Muslim 
League, Mr Zahid Rafiq Butt, has said his party will not hold talks 
with the government except on the issue of mid-term elections.

He alleged that the government had unleashed terror in Karachi and 
Hyderabad and accused the government of being anti-state and anti-
people.

The Muslim League leaders alleged that the government was using 
national wealth and the entire government machinery with a view to 
winning the bye-elections in Sanghar district and added that the 
people were being harassed and intimidated.

He demanded of the Election Commission to hold the bye-elections under 
the supervision of the judiciary and also held out a warning to the 
party workers that no violation of party discipline or party policy 
would be tolerated.

<a name="shuj">Shujaat warns of army take-over</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 24: Opposition Senator Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, who 
is also Chairman of the Senate standing committee on defence, said 
that the economic crises facing the country was badly hitting the 
defence and a stage might come when the army might have to take over 
the governments control.
    
The opposition Senator painted a grim situation of the countrys 
economy and said the government had brought the country to such an 
economic disaster where institutions like armed forces might be forced 
to carry out economic exercises along with the military exercises.

Without quoting economic statistics, the opposition Senator said a 
situation might arise when there would be no funds to pay the salaries 
to the armed forces and the army would have to abandon its development 
projects. If in-service personnel become victim of economic 
difficulties, it would cause serious threat to countrys defence.
    
He said though 10 per cent increase was made in the defence budget for 
fiscal 1994-95, but the increase was much less in real terms 
considering 14 per cent inflation rate that year. He also said 
similarly the defence budget was increased by 7 per cent in fiscal 
1995-96 but in real terms it has decreased because of inflation.
    
The opposition senator called on the President to take effective 
measures to correct the situation and direct the government to curtail 
non-development expenditure.

<a name="dema">Nawaz demands dismissal of Sindh CM</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 26: Leader of the opposition in the National Assembly, 
Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, has called for the dismissal of the incumbent 
Sindh Chief Minister and appointment of a non-controversial chief 
executive to steer the troubled province out of the prevailing crisis 
.
    
He urged President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari to take the step, keeping 
in view the larger national interest and said the non-controversial 
chief executive should be appointed with the mutual consent of the 
government, the opposition and the MQM.
    
He said the opposition would lend fullest possible cooperation, if a 
constitutional amendment or enactment of a fresh law is required in 
this regard. He said a sovereign committee, free from the influence of 
the federal government should be formed to formulate suggestions for 
the resolution of Karachi imbroglio.
    
Nawaz Sharif disputed the governments claim that MQM leader Altaf 
Hussain was a terrorist. Who has killed Altaf Hussains brother and 
nephew, if he is a terrorist, he posed a question and said according 
to the information gathered by him, the kins of the MQM leader have 
been assassinated at the behest of the government.
    
He said the offer of dialogue to the MQM was merely a cosmetic 
arrangement and added the government was insincere and non-serious in 
the dialogue with the MQM from the day one.

<a name="mnaf">PML MNA flays govt steps against business concerns</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 27: In the last 26 months, the PPP government has 
systematically tried to destroy the business concerns belonging to 
opposition leaders by either forcing them into default or asking 
NCB/DFIs to discontinue the financial assistance to their running 
businesses, says Khawaja M. Asif, MNA and chairman PML Anti-
corruption Committee.
    
In a statement issued he said, funds from NCB/DFIs are being made 
available to old and new concerns of individuals aligned with the 
government without keeping in view the rules and regulations 
regulating availability of credit.
    
He further stated a classic case is the transfer of Pengrio Sugar 
Mills Ltd, from the present management to the new owners who are very 
close relatives of two MNAs belonging to Peoples Party. This company 
according to its financial position, had an accumulated loss of Rs 
327.22 million on 30.9.1994 against its paid up capital of Rs 108.5 
million. The total outstanding liabilities as on 30.6.1995 aggregate 
of Rs. 621.124 million out of which Rs 107.149 million are the 
penalties levied by different creditor NCB/DFIs till 30.6.95.
    
On July 12 Haji Mansib Ali Ansari and Mrs Bilquees Z. Mirza on behalf 
of the other sponsors approached Bankers Equity Ltd for purchase of 
the said Sugar Mills from the present owners.
    
In response to their request, Bankers Equity Ltd, granted following 
concessions to the new buyers due to their political influence 
violating all norms of credit policy, he said
    
Bankers Equitys syndicated dues accrued up to 30.6.1995 will be 
capitalised at the old rate of 16 per cent (the prevailing lending 
rate in the financial market is 21 per cent). This concession will 
enable the new owners to pay back the dues in 16 equal instalments 
commencing from July 1, 1997.
    
He said the working capital which was payable on demand has been 
converted into long-term loan payable in 16 equal instalments 
commencing from July 1, 1997. Waiver of all the penalties amounting to 
Rs. 26.485 million, outstanding as on 30.6.95 levied on Bankers Equity 
Ltd, syndicate financing.
    
The present participation term certificate amounting to approximately 
Rs 70 million will be converted into term finance certificates, thus 
extending the repayment of this liability indefinitely.
    
He said it is obvious that the terms and conditions of this offer will 
be followed by the remaining creditor institutions and waiver of the 
penalties will reach the exorbitant level of Rs 107.149 million, thus 
causing a very substantial loss to these institutions. In addition to 
this, the remaining liabilities of Rs 280.389 will also be re-
structured/re-scheduled by the other financial institutions into long-
term financing at the confessional interest rate of 16 per cent.
    
He observed that gross misuse and plunder of financial institutions in 
the public sector for obliging the cronies of the present ruling 
couple is causing colossal loss rendering these institutions bankrupt 
and financially unviable. He said we demand that this plunder of

in the National Assembly that the present PPP government would 
complete its tenure.

speech, was based on a single demand of mid-term elections which is 
a day dream, he claimed. He said the people had given mandate to the 
Peoples Party for five years and therefore, elections would be held 
in 1998.
    
He further went on to add that the government of the PML, was 
responsible for creating ethnic polarisation in Karachi, while the PPP 
government has tried to overcome the polarisation.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 27: Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar claimed in the 
Senate that the government had already identified the culprits 
responsible for the Peshawar bomb blast and was now working on 
unearthing those who had financed the whole plan.
    
The interior minister did not divulge the identities of the criminals 
involved or whether any arrests had been made so far by the 
authorities. The only information he did dispense related to the 
details of the vehicle used in the blast.
    
Defending the performance of police and other security agencies, he 
said it was absolutely wrong to suggest that the agencies had not 
been on the alert and were sleeping or that the Peshawar blast had 
occurred due to some security lapse. He pointed out that it was due to 
the vigilance of the agencies that only recently two powerful bombs 
had been discovered and diffused.
    
He denied that FBI had been contacted in tracing out the terrorists 
involved in the blast. We will only sought FBIs help if necessary in 
identifying the quantity of contents of the explosives.

Senator Ishtiaq Azhar through a call attention notice wanted the 
government to explain its practice of what he alleged to be the 
extra-judicial killing of MQM workers in fake police encounters.
    
The minister denied the charge and insisted that all terrorists had 
been killed only in encounters with law enforcement agencies, and only 
after they took up arms against the agency personnel. He also 
dismissed the allegation that the government was supporting the MQM 
Haqiqi faction.

PESHAWAR, Dec. 21: At least 40 people were killed and nearly 120 
injured when a powerful explosion rocked the central part of the city, 
blowing up a number of shops and setting others on fire. The blast was 
said to have been caused by a car bomb.
    
Among those killed in the blast is Maimoona, daughter of the NWFP 
Transport Minister Attaullah Jan, the granddaughter of the governor.
 
Many shops caught fire while windowpanes of showrooms and houses in a 
radius of one-and-half kilometres were smashed and the roofs of a 
couple nearby buildings collapsed. A number of people were feared to 
be trapped in the debris of the shops which had basements. After the 
explosion, the whole area was cordoned off by law-enforcement 
personnel.
    
A state of emergency was declared in the city and cantonment 
hospitals.
    
Most of the bodies were recovered early after the blast, but those of 
six children were dug out from inside the garment shops late in the 
evening. Rescue workers fear that more bodies might be found. 
According to the IGP, one ASI and two policemen were missing. The 
bodies were at the Lady Reading Hospital and most of them could not be 
identified as they were totally charred.

PESHAWAR, Dec. 22: The death toll in the blast was put at 38 on Friday 
by official sources, although independent sources and the people 
involved in rescue operations insisted on over 40 deaths. The total 
number of people injured and still in various city hospitals is put at 
125. A large number of injured were, however removed from hospitals 
after first aid.

Rescue operations launched soon after the explosion continued 
throughout the day on Friday and PAF and army also joined in. People 
at the site complained of lack of expertise on the part of rescuers 
and absence of proper fire-fighting equipment to cope with the 
catastrophe. Fire extinguishers managed to control the fire at one pm 
on Friday.

A large number of people remained trapped in the basement of Wudood 
Sons departmental store due to the blockade of the emergency exit in 
the basement. Another factor which made the situation grim was the 
fact that civil defence operators did not know the proper use of 
oxygen masks.

Besides a number of shoppers and salesmen, the owner of the 
departmental store Mohammad Hamed Wudood Siddiqui also died of 
suffocation in the basement, eyewitnesses and survivors said.

Whereabouts of a large number of people could not be known as the kith 
and kin of the missing people looked for them in vain. Official 
sources said at least 10 bodies were still lying at the Khyber Medical 
College for identification, whereas the rest were taken away by their 
heirs and buried.

Speculation that a number of people were trapped in the basement 
prompted rescue operators and army personnel to intensify search 
operation only to find none in the basement.

into the Thursday bomb blast revealed that the nature of explosive was 
identical to that seized from two Afghan nationals arrested during the 
chief ministership of Mir Afzal Khan.

The official, talking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity said the 
provincial government through the federal interior ministry had sought 
the help of a foreign country to track down culprits involved in the 
blast.

The device was said to be of Russian make and had an intensity of 25 
kg, according to bomb disposal squad. However, according to the 
source, the five special teams constituted for investigations have 
been asked to submit report within 72 hours. The five teams comprise 
Peshawar District Police, Crimes Branch, Special Branch, Intelligence 
Bureau and Inter Services Intelligence.

According to police sources they have recovered the engine of the car 
identified as Toyota Mark 2 which was used in the blast. The engine 
number of the car is said to be 3K5835376. No registration plate has

Registration departments all over the province to detect registration 
number of the car.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 22: Opposition leader Nawaz Sharif has strongly 
condemned the act of terrorism in Peshawar where a large number of 
people were killed and numerous others injured in a car-bomb blast.

The PML president in a statement expressed his condolences with the 
families of those killed in the blast.

He demanded that the government must act immediately to track down the 
perpetrators of this crime. People, he said, were already groaning 
under exorbitant price-hike and terrorism was apt to add to their 
tribulations.

Administrative apparatus had failed to protect the lives and property 
of citizens leaving people in perpetual fear, he claimed. He 
criticised the PPP governments security lapses which had led to an 
abject failure to protect the lives and property of citizens.

He claimed that security lapses were taking place largely due to the 
fact that the state security apparatus like the police, the FIA and 
intelligence bureau had become a tool of the PPP regime and were being 
used to harass and victimise the opposition, rather than providing 
security and nabbing terrorists and criminals.

prevailed.
    
The police had dug up some ten graves for unknown deceased on Friday

LAHORE, Dec. 23: Holding the Rabbani regime responsible for subversive 
activities in Pakistan, including the deadly bomb blast in Peshawar 
which caused a massive loss of human lives, National Assembly Kashmir 
Committee Chairman Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan urged the government on to 
retaliate by attacking military installations in Afghanistan.
    
He said no other country would oppose an attack by Pakistan as no 
country spoke against Israel when it took similar action against 
Lebanon on a minor activity by the latter. He did not agree with the 
suggestion that before resorting to such an extreme act, Pakistan 
should raise the matter with the United Nations.

About the Rabbani regime, he said its attitude towards Pakistan was 
inimical but friendly towards India. It was for this reason that 
Pakistans embassy in Kabul was attacked and Islamabads ambassador 
was seriously hurt, who was brought to Pakistan in a very serious 
condition.

that the US government would consider the request purely on merit. 
According to him, the government of Pakistan has not so far contacted 
the US administration seeking such help.
    
In the meantime at Peshawar, the AIG Police in charge of the Bomb

offer by FBI.

PESHAWAR, Dec. 23: The three teams constituted to investigate 
explosion in Peshawar Cantonment, have submitted three different 
versions to the provincial administration but all three confirm that 
the blast was the result of a serious security lapse and that a prior 
warning had been conveyed to the provincial government on Dec. 14 in 
this regard, highly placed sources told Dawn.

The security agencies and other officials have hinted at the 
involvement of a neighbouring Muslim country, according to one 
version. At least three highly placed officials and political sources 
have expressed this view and suggested to the investigating agencies 
to follow this course in their investigations.

It is also learnt that before the formation of the three committees, 
headed by DIG Peshawar range, DIG special branch and AIG CID, a 
sensitive intelligence agency had indicated in its report to 
authorities the involvement of the Rabbani government.

According to another version, the Al Jehad organisation of Egypt was 
involved in the blast. Those who believe in this version, including 
the chief minister and the federal interior minister, are reportedly 
expecting an announcement by that organisation, which traditionally 
accepts responsibility for acts of terrorism and sabotage it carries 
out.

The stance of the third about the Indian factor has been turned down 
for the time being.

KABUL, Dec. 23: Afghan officials denied allegations that Afghanistan

The denial came after suspicions in Pakistan that agents of the Afghan 
secret service might have been involved in the bombing in a crowded 
shopping centre on Thursday which killed more than 40 people according 
to official estimate.

It is ridiculous and false to accuse Afghanistan of this shameful 
crime, a defence ministry official said. The official said that 
although Afghanistan was experiencing problems with Pakistans 
government, it did not mean that any violent action would be taken 
against the people of the neighbouring country.

PESHAWAR, Dec. 26: Leader of the opposition in the National Assembly  
Mohammad Nawaz Sharif has demanded of the government to expose the 
culprits responsible for the Peshawar bomb blast.

He attributed these disastrous acts to the failure of the government 
in adopting a correct Afghan policy. Mr Sharif held the government 
responsible for the deterioration of countrys relations with the 
Kabul regime. It was pity, he said, that Pakistan embassy in Kabul was 
burnt down and its ambassador injured in an assault, while no, similar 
incident took place in Delhi, despite the two countries having remain 
engaged in three wars.

The opposition leader expressed his extreme anguish and sorrow over 
the loss of innocent lives, including children and women, and deplored 
the governments apathy towards public security. He feared that if 
necessary precautionary steps were not taken right now, such 
occurrences may spread to other parts of the country, as already 
blasts have occurred in Lahore, Faisalabad and other places.

PESHAWAR, Dec. 26: The NWFP Police released the sketch of a Persian-
speaking Afghan national believed to be the main accused of the 
Peshawar bomb blast. The suspect has been identified as Abdul Matin.
    
Inspector-General of Police Syed Masood Shah said the identity of the 
accused had been disclosed after considering all the aspects of the 
case. Mr. Masood Shah was, however, not sure about the prime suspects 
whereabouts.
    
Giving details, the IGP said the probe teams had gathered all details 
about the vehicle used in the explosion. The sketch of the accused was 
released which was drawn by a police expert with the help of four men, 
including the owner of the bargain centre and his employees.
    
The IGP was confident that people would help in the arrest of the 
accused as the government had announced head money to the tune of Rs 
10 million for information leading to his arrest.
    
Giving details about the explosion, Mr Shah said the saboteurs were 
seen by the injured persons escaping in a double cabin pick-up after 
leaving the vehicle with headlights on. S.P. Salahuddin of Traffic 
police who was present with his family (two of his children died in 
the blast) had ordered removal of the car and police personnel on duty 
were in the process of removing the car when the explosion occurred.

The device, explosion experts said, was attached to the headlights and 
the saboteurs had done so to avoid falling victim themselves. They 
would have put off the lights in case they had failed in finding out a 
proper place to abandon the car.

Responding to a question, the IG Police claimed that the probe teams 
and intelligence agencies were certain that Afghan nationals were 
involved in the blast who might have links with some groups. He 
admitted that a number of saboteur gangs were operative in the 
province. He however, did not attribute the terrorist act to a 
particular government or country. Mr Shah claimed that the police had 
taken foolproof security measures to provide protection to the main 
witnesses who had helped the police in tracking down the main 
culprits.
    
When asked about the steps taken to check any such incident in future, 
Mr Shah said certain proposals were already under consideration in 
this regard. He said the prime minister had sought proposals for 
setting up of centres to cope with emergency in future.

National Assembly for the second consecutive day to protest against 
the attack on the offices of Sindhi-language daily Kawish and burning 
of newspaper bundles by the workers of a Sindhi nationalist party.
    
The issue was raised on a point of order by the opposition member

being conducted against the Sindhi daily and accused the government of 
failing to provide protection to the newspapers. He regretted that no 
one has been arrested although the case has been registered against 
the culprits.
    
Mr Jaffer Iqbal said Federal Education Minister Khursheed Shah had 
assured the House that he would inform the House about these incidents 
after talking with Sindh Chief Minister Abdullah Shah but he failed to 
take the House into confidence.
    
Interior Minister Naseerullah Babar told the House that he would 
personally look into the matter and assured that all those involved in 
these incidents would be taken to task.
    
Later a delegation of Rawalpindi-Islamabad Union of Journalists led by 
its President C.R. Shamsi met the Interior Minister in his chamber 
where the Bureau Chief of Daily Kawish informed the minister about the 
attacks by the members of the Jiye Sindh party on the newspaper 
offices. He said that newspaper bundles were being snatched by anti-
social elements and burnt.
    
Mr Babar immediately contacted the Inspector General of Sindh and 
asked him to arrest all the people involved in these attacks and to 
register cases against them. He asked the IG Sindh to ensure smooth 
delivery and supply of the newspaper. The Interior Minister directed 
the IG Sindh to send him a copy of the FIR registered with the police 
in connection with the attack on the bureau office of the Sindhi daily 
in Larkana.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KARACHI Dec. 24: The President and the Honorary Secretary- General of 
Pakistan Newspapers and Periodicals Organisation, Arif Nizami and 
Hameed Haroon, respectively, have condemned the targeting of Sindhi 
daily Kawish, its journalists, employees and distributors by a 
political party in the interior of Sindh and in Karachi and described 
it as infringement of the freedom of the Press and right to free 
expression.

In a Press release issued on Sunday, they said: Over the last week 
acts of violence against the daily Kawish have been mounting in the 
province. The management and journalists of the beleaguered newspaper 
have alleged that the violence against the newspaper is at the 
instigation of the high command of an ethnic political party in the 
interior of Sindh.
    
The political party, in return, has not denied the allegation and 
appears to be unwilling to de-escalate their attacks on the employees 
of the newspaper.
    
The administration has taken no steps to curtail the spread of 
violence against newspaper distributors, vehicles and the offices of 
Kawish, although sympathetic concern has been voiced by Chief Minister 
Syed Abdullah Shah. The statement also mentioned that in order to 
preserve the independence of the Sindhi Press, the government must act 
to solve the problem.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 24: Leader of the Opposition Nawaz Sharif has accused 
the PPP government of curbing the Press freedom in Pakistan.

In a statement issued here he alleged that the government was out to 
curb the freedom of Press and that was why it was acting as a 
spectator on the case of daily Kawish.
    
He condemned the systematic attacks on the daily and termed these acts 
of violence an infringement on the freedom of expression and the 
freedom of Press.

He also mentioned that the PPP regime whose entire state machinery was 
otherwise active in violating the human rights of PML activists and 
parliamentarians, has not taken any tangible steps to protect Press 
freedom by providing security to Kawish against attacks from 
hooligans.

KARACHI, Dec. 27: The Pakistan Newspapers and Periodicals Organisation 
(PNPO) at an emergent meeting of its executive committee adopted a 
resolution strongly condemning the acts of violence and vandalism 
against member publication Kawish and called upon all political 
parties and elements to respect and uphold freedom of Press as 
guaranteed under the Constitution of Pakistan.

The meeting noted that Sindh Chief Minister Syed Abdullah Shah had 
given firm assurance for the protection of newspapers and newsmen to 
several delegations of the PNPO and the NECP.
    
The meeting noted that orders were also issued by the office of the 
chief minister to security enforcement agencies, including police for 
ensuring protection of newspapers and newsmen. Yet the violation of 
the firm assurance of the chief minister of Sindh was taking place 
every second day.
    
The meeting noted that this was a very unsatisfactory situation and 
decided to bring the whole issue before the special liaison committee 
set up by the Sindh government at the chief secretarys level for 
ensuring protection and safety to the pressmen.
    
The meeting called upon the Sindh government to improve immediately 
the measures for proper protection of newsmen and newspaper offices in 
Karachi and the province of Sindh.

Bureau Report

LAHORE, Dec. 27: Acting Punjab Governor Muhammad Hanif Ramay 
inaugurated the two-day South Asian Regional Round-Table accusing 
media of playing the negative role of fanning conflicts.
  
The acting governor said in a democratic set-up there had to be a 
culture of dialogue. But whenever there is a possibility of a 
dialogue, media has a negative role to play.
    
He said unnecessary words are put into the mouths of rival parties to 
widen gap between them.
    
Mr Ramay said politicians used to live in conflicts. But media must 
have to understand that there must be a resolution to every conflict 
for the creation of a humane society.
    
He said if Middle East and the South African issues could be resolved, 
conflicts between Pakistan and India and Pakistani government and the 
opposition could also be resolved. But this needed some time and 
patience. Where certain matters require quiet diplomacy, others need 
media to remain quiet, Mr Ramay said.

According to knowledgeable sources, the Defence Department had earlier

<a name="worl">World Bank conditions met : Punjab raises water rates</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mahmood Zaman

LAHORE, Dec. 21: The Punjab government has decided to increase 
irrigation water charges (abiana) by 25 per cent from the next fiscal 
year according to a World Bank proposal.
    
The water rate was increased by 25 per cent earlier this year after a 
period of 11 years. As such this will be the second increase in water 
rate charges.
    
The committee that was set up for the purpose met and discussed a 
number of suggestions. It was of the view that the water rate had to 
be increased to meet the World Bank conditionalities for a $800 
million loan for the National Drainage Project aimed at reclamation of 
saline and waterlogged lands with the help of Left Bank Outfall Drain 
(LBOD) and the Right Bank Canal.
    
An agreement with the World Bank was concluded by the previous 
government which was signed by the WAPDA authorities on behalf of the 
federal government and the Punjab irrigation department under the late 
Ghulam Haider Wynes provincial government. Other provinces were also 
under an obligation to increase water rates.
    
Under the World Banks conditions the water rate has to be increased 
in order to match operational and management cost of supplying canal 
water to crops.
    
Sindh, the NWFP and Balochistan have already met the World Bank 
conditions and revised water charges. The Punjab has so far not done 
so as first the Wyne government and then the Wattoo government had 
deferred the matter for one reason or another.
    
Both the governments had a uniform view that instead of raising water 
rate, efforts should be made to improve the process of recovery of the 
charges.
    
Under the new system, the provincial government will set up an 
autonomous water board at the provincial level with farmers 
organisations (FOs) and water-users associations (WUAs) to supervise 
irrigation water supply. A new law was in the making to give legal and 
statutory sanction to the new irrigation network.

<a name="kanu">KANUPP's operating life may extend </a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

KARACHI, Dec. 22: The operating life of the Karachi Nuclear Power 
Project (KANUPP) is expected to extend to year 2012, ten years beyond 
its designed life, it is learnt.

At present the KANUPP is undertaking various projects which include 
replacement of obsolete computers, control and instrumentation, and 
refurbishment of mechanical equipment. Simultaneously, a project has 
been initiated to thoroughly review the design safety. The operational 
safety of the plant has been quite satisfactory during the past few 
decades.

Pakistan at present is confronted with the problem of loadshedding. At 
peak times, there is a power deficiency of about 2,000 megawatts. The 
shortage is likely to reach 4,000 MW by the end of the century unless 
appropriate measures are taken to add new plants to the grid.

Recently the government has taken some major initiatives in the energy 
sector pertaining to the setting up of thermal and hydro plants in the 
country, which will alleviate the energy shortage in the years to 
come.

According to the PAEC, in the long term perspective, Pakistan needs a 
judicious mix of different modes of electricity generation, which 
should satisfy such obvious criteria, like cost-effectiveness, 
reduction of import dependence, promotion of self-reliance and 
limiting environmental degradation.

<a name="deaf">Deaf ears and hot air</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

SOMETHING that President Farooq Leghari said in Islamabad last week 
can only find a poignant echo in Lahore.

Addressing a gathering of Pakistani doctors settled in the US, he 
appealed to philanthropists to help establish medical facilities for 
the less fortunate citizens of the country.

Wherever you turn in Lahore, you find that almost all charitable 
hospitals in the city where patients can get free or subsidised 
treatment date back to before independence and all of them were 
founded by Hindus.

You have the Ganga Ram hospital, Gulab Devi, Janki Devi and the 
Moolchand hospital. There were smaller health units or dispensaries 
many of which have disappeared. But the bigger hospitals remain and 
are performing a valuable public service. In fact, ordinary citizens 
wouldnt know where to go if it werent for these four big hospitals 
and, of course, the Mayo, Services and Lady Willingdon.

Since independence, not a single big hospital has been endowed by any 
Muslim. A few of the rich have established wards or beds in the 
existing hospitals, but that is about all. The Sharif familys Ittefaq 
Hospital does provide low-cost treatment facilities for those who can 
establish that their means are limited, but it isnt a public hospital 
in the sense in which Ganga Ram or Gulab Devi are. Imran Khans 
Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital is for cancer patients only, and 
there is limited provision for treating people free of cost.

Many, many Muslims have built many, many hospitals in Lahore since 
1947, and while they no doubt fill a gap left by the government health 
services, they are basically commercial propositions. Parts of Jail 
Road and Gulberg bristle with hospitals and pathology laboratories and 
group-practice complexes with provision for indoor patients. But they 
are all for those who are ready to shell out considerable sums of 
money. The poor still have to go to hospitals set up by Hindu or Sikh 
philanthropists (or by the British authorities, with the exception of 
Services).

It is true that before 1947, much of the wealth in the Punjab was in 
the hands of non-Muslims, and those of them so inclined had the means 
to set up trusts to run hospitals, educational institutions and 
libraries. But even in those days, there wasnt any dearth of rich 
Muslim feudal families; apparently they didnt think much beyond their 
lands and getting a seat in the assemblies. We now have an abundance 
of rich Muslim industrialists and businessmen, but none appears to be 
moved by any strong urge to be remembered by posterity for a good 
public deed.

This is just another indication of the kind of grasping, uncaring 
society we have become, and President Legharis plea is bound to fall 
on deaf ears.

The governments own attitude towards provision of basic health 
facilities is marked by gross indifference and negligence. Punjab 
Chief Minister Arif Nakai, talking to a WHO delegation on December 13, 
said the government was taking concrete steps for introducing positive 
changes in medical education and research, and the performance of 
basic health units and rural health centres has been improved to 
provide better health-care services at village level.

This is sheer hot air. The fact is that doctors are not willing to go 
to the rural areas, and consequently a number of basic health units 
and rural centres are lying closed. There are buildings but no 
doctors. That is the plain and simple truth, and the chief minister at 
least owes it to the public not to make claims which he cannot 
substantiate.

Whats the use of making tall claims when the reality on the ground 
mocks every word uttered by our leaders?

Meet Sabz and Zaitooni.
Theyve been around for 180 million and would like to stay.

Can they?
Its up to you


Pakistan harbours 2 of the 7 species of turtles found in the world 
today.

For 180 million years, Sabz (Green Turtle) and Zaitooni (Olive Ridley 
Turtle) have come to Karachis beaches to lay their eggs. Sadly today 
Sabz and Zaitooni are in danger. Soon they may be extinct. Unless you 
help.

Once the eggs are laid, Sabz and Zaitooni returns to the sea. The eggs 
although camouflaged in a nest hole are threatened by predators; Every 
year fewer and fewer eggs  hatch. If this continues, none of Sabz and 
Zaitoonis eggs will hatch and they will disappear forever.

Are you going to allow this to happen?

Sabz and Zaitooni are a vital balancing link in our ecological system. 
They have brought colour and variety to our beaches. They are one of 
the most ancient vertebrate life forms in the world and play an 
important role in our understanding of nature.

Once Sabz and Zaitooni go they will never come back! 

To save Sabz and Zaitooni, more enclosures to protect their eggs have 
to be built and maintained. But we cannot manage alone.

We need your help to ensure that Sabz and Zaitooni stay.

So its up to you.

Please join us in saying ........

Facts on the Marine Turtles of Pakistan
Two species of marine turtles nest on Karachis beaches at Hawkesbay 
and Sandspit; the Green Turtle (Sabz Kachwa) and Olive Ridley 
(Zaitooni Ridley Kachwa).

The Green Turtle (Sabz Kachwa):
* Latin name: Chelonia Mydas
* Adult shell length: 90-110 cms
* Adult weight: 280-300 Ibs
* Food: Seaweed
* Nesting areas: Tropical & subtropical beaches around the world
* Interesting Fact: They are the only vegetarian species among marine 
turtles. It takes 12 to 15 years before they reach adulthood and 
return to nest. They have the highest commercial value for food among 
all sea turtles.

The Olive Ridley Turtle (Zaitooni Ridley Kachwa):
* Latin Name: Lepidochelys Olivacea
* Adult shell length: 70-75 cms
* Adult weight: 100-150 Ibs
* Food: molluscs
* Nesting areas: Costa Rica, India, Mexico and Pakistan
* Interesting Fact: The rarest and smallest among marine turtles.

How do turtles make a nest and by their eggs?
Coming ashore at night the female turtle digs a 3 feet deep hole with 
her powerful flippers. Once fixed in this depression she lays an 
average of 100 eggs. After laying the eggs she covers the hole with 
sand using both her front and rear flippers and then return to the 
sea.

What happens after the eggs hatch?
The eggs usually hatch after 40 to 60 days due to the heat from the 
sun and0 the chemical composition of the sand. Once they hatch they 
are attached to the brightest spot over the sea. If there are 
artificial lights the hatchlings are easily disoriented. They may then 
run inland and suffer exhaustion, desiccation, death by predators or 
accidents by vehicles on the road.

Why do Turtles Cry?
Turtles appear to shed tears when they come ashore to lay their eggs. 
In fact they are excreting excess salt from their bodies to maintain 
their physiological salt balance.

Why are Turtles disappearing from our Shores ?
All marine turtles species are in danger of extinction due to the 
following reasons:
- Commercial trade for turtle skins shells medicines and cosmetics.
- Destruction of the eggs by predators and poachers
- Accidental capture of turtles in fishing nets.
- Extensive shore-line development human disturbances and pollution.

Why Protect our Turtles ?
Turtles are known as the last of the worlds living dinosaurs. They 
first appeared on earth between 150 and 200 million years ago during 
the Triassic period. Their ancestors were land dwelling reptiles. Now 
if through negligence and greed we allow these magnificent animals to 
become extinct we will lose one of the most ancient vertebrate life 
forms in our world today.

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 21: The next adjustment in Pakistan rupee is not 
expected to occur till late 1996 as the movement of the currency by 
minus 11 per cent against US dollar in 1995 is seen to have exceeded 
the trend rate of depreciation which on an average was eight per cent 
over the last five years.
    
An internationally reputable brokerage house on the economic outlook 
for Pakistan, says that the prospect of a flight of capital from 
Pakistan is remote now that the IMF has committed 600 million dollars 
of standby facility which will be followed by reactivation of the 1.5 
billion dollar IMF ESAF\EFF facilities.
    
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS: The report projects the interest rates to rise in 
1996 due to increasing demands for funds by infrastructure projects 
and government borrowing continuing to overshoot budgetary targets. 
The current inflexibility of interests rates on government borrowing 
has been partly attributed to the fact that over 30 per cent of 
government expenditure goes on servicing public debt, of which over 60 
per cent is domestic government paper. Therefore, any increase in 
treasury bill rates, which are de facto  benchmark for deposit and 
lending rates, will only serve to increase the fiscal deficit which is 
already in excess of six per cent of GDP.

KARACHI, Dec. 21: The directors of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), 
approved the credit control measures recently introduced by the SBP.
    
An SBP press release claimed that the directors felt satisfied with 
what it called healthy improvement in the balance of payments in the 
recent past. Headlined as Foreign Exchange Reserves increased to $ 
1.53 billion, the release said the gross reserves of the SBP rose 
from $ 1.1 billion at the end of November to $ 1.53 billion on 
December 20. The release further claimed that foreign currency 
deposits rose by $ 127 million between the end of November and 
December 20 without quoting the competing figures.
    
But a source privy to the meeting said foreign exchange reserves are 
not normally referred to as gross reserves which also include gold 
reserves.
    
The source said the meeting was told about a big jump in the liquid 
reserves which stood merely at $525 million on December 14 but he 
could not quantify the exact increase.
  
It said the board of the SBP directors noted with satisfaction the 
indications of an increase in exports, slowdown in imports and an 
improving trend in the current account of the balance of payments.
    
The directors were also briefed about the recent monetary, fiscal and 
balance of payments development at the meeting. The SBP chief told the 
meeting that the government borrowing for budgetary support declined 
from Rs 55.5 billion upto November 23, 1995 to Rs 51.6 billion upto

The SBP chief was optimistic that the figure would come down to Rs 40 
billion by the end of this month. The meeting also noted with 
satisfaction the disbursement of production loans to agriculture that 
stood at Rs 4.3 billion at the end of November 1995 a 36 per cent 
increase over the comparative figure of the last year.

<a name="extr">Extra burden on loan repayments to worsen situation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mohammad Malick

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 21: The recent 7 per cent devaluation of rupee will 
place an extra burden of Rs 2043 million on the country's foreign loan 
repayments for 1995-96.

Presently, Pakistan's disbursed and outstanding external debt stands 
at US$ 21,324 million. This extra burden will further add to an 
already strained financial situation where the government's domestic 
borrowing for year 1994-95 comes to Rs 95.4 billion. Out of this Rs 
34.6 billion has come from bank sources while non-bank borrowings 
account for the major bulk of Rs 60.8 billion.

The government meanwhile has already overshot its borrowing target 
limit for the entire  period of 1995-96 during the first quarter of 
the current financial year.

The domestic debt in 1992-93 stood at Rs 83 billion with bank 
borrowings accounting for Rs 60.3 billion, while the figure shot up to 
Rs 94 billion in 1993-94 with the major chunk of Rs 60.1 billion 
coming from non-bank sources once again.

Interesting enough, the non-bank borrowings which include schemes like 
high-interest paying savings schemes etc are viewed as highly 
expensive propositions for the government and are only used grudgingly 
by the economic managers.  These statistics were revealed during 
government's replies to opposition's queries.

<a name="anti">Anti-dumping Duties Act in the offing</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 23: A draft anti-dumping and countervailing duties Act 
1995 has been prepared by the National Tariff Commission (NTC) and 
awaiting approval by the competent authority.

According to NTC source, the proposed Act has been drawn in the light 
of the provision of GATT Agreement of April 1994. NTC is presently 
busy in framing rules and formats for obtaining the requisite 
information so that it can assist the government in initiating anti-
dumping actions as soon as dumping is reported by the indigenous 
industry, he added.

The anti-dumping action can be initiated only after a formal request 
for the same has been made by and on behalf of the domestic industry 
and is supported by those domestic producers whose collective output 
constitutes more than 50 % of the total production of the like product 
produced by the portion of the domestic industry.

NTC is tasked to assist the government in cases of dumping and unfair 
trade practices. Increased level of anti-dumping action by industry 
world-wide, is a reflection of the ease with which an importing 
country can prove dumping especially when the anti-dumping actions 
involve no costs for those taking them.

With a view to pre-empting requests for anti-dumping action, the 
source said, NTC also plans to develop a data base containing 
independent information on international price intelligence to be able 
to recognise normal or below normal values and costs of production 
data along with historical production statistics, to ascertain 
injury to domestic industry and the casual link between the two.

NTC works under the Ministry of Commerce and is required to advise the 
government on tariff measures or other forms of assistance for 
providing protection to the indigenous industry and promoting exports 
by improving its competitiveness. It is also expected to assist the 
government on measures to counter dumping and the unfair practices 
adopted in respect of import and sale of foreign goods in Pakistan.

The main objective is to provide protection to these industries to 
ensure their private profitability with a view to keeping the existing 
investment afloat on the one hand and inducing fresh investment on the 
other.

<a name="revi">Review of interest rate policy requested</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 23: President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, 
(KCCI), Haji Shafiqur Rehman has called upon the Government to review 
the interest rate policy including the rate of return in deposits.
    
Expressing concern over the rise in lending rate, the KCCI chief said: 
there exists no justification for charging higher rate of interest 
when average rate of return is seven to nine per cent. He said after 
taking into consideration elements of inflation, deduction of zakat 
and withholding tax, depositors were left with a negative rate of 
saving.
    
In a statement on Saturday, Haji Shafiqur Rehman said that the higher 
rate of inflation as well as banks borrowing by the Government on a 
massive scale had been contributing to higher rate of interest.

The KCCI chief said as against a target of deficit financing to the 
tune of Rs 30 million for the current, already banks borrowing to the 
extent of Rs 45 million had been affected resulting in monetary 
expansion and consequent rise in inflation.

He pointed out that national rate of savings of Pakistan was hardly 
14% as against 22% in India.

<a name="nfns">MFN status: Pakistan not to extend India any special favours</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 27: Pakistan would not be according any special favour 
to India, when and if, Islamabad finally grants the Most Favoured 
Nation (MFN) status to our southern neighbour which would be enjoying 
this status along with a crowd of 130 nations, all signatories of GATT 
agreement.
    
At the official level, the inevitability of granting India the MFN 
status has seemingly finally sunk in. However, in order to be able to 
face the new trade challenges, which would not come from India alone, 
the officials are apparently trying to buy enough time for 
preparations.
    
Another challenge that looks the government straight in the face is 
the continued confusion in the minds of a part of officialdom that 
somehow the Kashmir cause would suffer if India is granted the MFN 
status. 
   
Unless this confusion is sorted out at the official level and a 
unified position is taken, it would not be easy for the government to 
convince the nation at large that the MFN status does not accord India 
a special position vis-a-vis Islamabads other 130 trading partners.
    
Also, the government needs to clarify to all interested parties that 
granting of MNF to India does not mean establishment of a free trade 
area between the two countries. This is a matter that is being pursued 
on the SAARC track.

<a name="shar">Shares recover broadly on all counters</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 21: Stocks appeared to be in a buoyant mood aided 
apparently by Prime Ministers  visit to the Karachi Stock Exchange. 
The prices recovered broadly on all the counters.
    
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100-share posted a good gain of 
about 20 points at 1,460.01 and seemed to be edging progressively to 
its new chart point of 1,500 before the year is out.
    
The market advance was largely led by cement, synthetic, auto and some 
of the leading shares on other counters, notably some of the MNCs. 
Cement shares attracted active short-covering at the lower levels and 
recovered broadly under the lead of Cherat, D.G.Khan, Lucky and Maple 
Leaf Cement.
    
Bank shares followed them as leading bank shares, notably Askari, MCB, 
Prime Bank and some others rose sharply and so did some of the leading 
leasing shares under the lead of Askari Leasing, and Pilcorp.
    
Insurance also rose, major gainers among them being Adamjee Insurance, 
Century Insurance, East-West Insurance and Muslim Insurance.
    
Other leading shares, which managed to put on good gains were led by 
Gadoon Textiles, Searle Pakistan, Bata, Nestle Milkpak, and Pakistan 
Gum.
    
Leading losers were led by blue chips such as PSO, Shell Pakistan 
Colgate Pakistan, Wellcome Pakistan and Brooke Bond, falling by one 
rupee to Rs 4, biggest fall of Rs 4 being in Shell.
    
They were followed by Wazir Ali Industries, Diamond Industries, Treet 
Corporation, and Highnoon Lab.
    
The most active list was again topped by PTC shares, up Rs 1.15 on a 
massive volume of about 9 million shares. It was followed by Hub 
Power, which was also heavily traded but it held on to its last levels 
amid either-way movement depending on the mood of foreign funds.
    
The other actively traded shares were led by ICI Pakistan, up Rs 1.30 
on 777,000 shares followed by Dewan Salman, firm 75 paisa on 600,000 
shares, Faysal Bank, steady 45 paisa on 450,000 shares, Cherat Cement, 
up Rs 1.50 on 406,500 shares, Lucky Cement, higher Rs 1.35 on 289,500 
shares, and Fauji Fertiliser, up Rs 1.50 on 218,500 shares.
    
Trading volume soared to 26.175 million shares from the previous 
25.730 million shares thanks to heavy dealings in pivotals.
    
There were 361 actives, out of which 150 shares rose, while 134 fell, 
with 77 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="stoc">Stocks maintain uppish leaning</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 26: Stocks maintained an uppish leaning but follow-up 
support was not that aggressive, which could drive bears out of the 
rings.
    
The KSE 100-share index posted a fresh gain of 6.46 points at 
1,497.59, only short of 2.41 point from the psychological barrier of 
1,500. Its previous close was 1,497.77.
    
Dividend announcements both from Dewan Salman at 20 per cent cash and 
an identical amount of bonus shares and seven per cent cash by Tri-
Star Modaraba were in line with the market expectations owing to a bad 
year and were well-received.  But an omission by First Habib Modaraba 
was disappointing and has its toll.
    
After consolidating its post-record dividend (320 per cent), BOC 
Pakistan resumed its upward drive as the management and some other 
investors reappeared in the rings to grab the floating stock. There 
were sellers as 800 shares were traded and in the process it rose by 
another Rs 70 to Rs 550 its peak level so far.
    
National Asset Leasing, Lease Pakistan, Standard Chartered Union and 
Trust Leasing were notable gainers among them.
    
In the bank sector, Citicorp, Crescent Bank, MCB, Al-Faysal and Javed 
Omer and some others were leading gainers.
    
Leading insurance and textile shares also came in for active short-
covering and generally ended partially recovered under the lead of 
Dadabhoy, ALICO, Universal and EFU Insurance. Leading gainers in 
textile sector were led by Gadoon, Regent Textiles, Kohinoor Textiles 
and Nishat Mills.

Barring Dewan Salman, which was massively traded after the news of 20 
per cent cash dividend and 20 per cent bonus, synthetic shares were 
generally neglected including Dhan Fibre and Pak Synthetics for want 
of support.
    
Cement shares came in for stray support and extended the previous 
gains and so did energy shares, major gainers among them being Cherat, 
Dadabhoy and D.G.Khan Cement.
    
Among the energy shares, PSO, Mari Gas Nishat Tek and some other rose, 
while Haroon Oils, and Sui Southern fell modestly on selling at the 
higher levels.
    
While Siemens Pakistan, Engro Chemicals, Glaxo Lab, Lever Brothers, 
Pakistan Elektron, and Al-Ghazi Tractors rose sharply, Shell, Ciba-
Geigy, Parke-Davis, Pakistan Gum Hoechst Pakistan, Nestle, Milkpak and 
Wellcome Pakistan suffered modest pruning on late selling.
    
PTC vouchers topped the list of most actives, lower 20 paisa on 5.125 
million shares followed by Hub-Power, easy 25 paisa on 5 million 
shares, Dewan Salman, up 85 paisa on 1.180 million shares, ICI 
Pakistan, down 45 paisa on 640,600 shares, Faysal Bank, lower 15 paisa 
on 410,900 shares, Trust Leasing up 50 paisa on 377,000 shares, 25th 
ICP, unchanged on 129,000 shares and Askari Bank, lower 15 paisa on 
106,500 shares.
    
Trading volume fell from the previous peak level of 35.518 million 
shares to 20.019 million shares owing to the absence of leading 
sellers.
    
There were 334 actives, out of which 155 shares rose, 124 fell, with 
55 remaining unchanged.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce reporter

KARACHI, Dec. 27: Stocks were in a buoyant mood under the lead of blue 
chips and generally tended further higher on active new account 
buying.
    
The KSE 100-share index posted a good gain of 12.97 points at 1,510.86 
attaining the coveted mark.
    
Although the market advance was led by leading shares, some of the 
low-priced issues also came in for active short-covering at the lower 
levels and ended higher under the lead of textile shares.
    
Plus signs dominated the list, although the market advance was led by 
heavy buying in the bank and energy sectors, which showed good gains 
across a broad front.
    
Prominent gainers were led by Siemens, Universal Leather and Security 
Safe Deposits, which came in for active support on news of higher 
working result and ended higher by Rs 5, 7 and 9.75 respectively.
    
They were followed by leading shares, notably Dewan Salman, which came 
in for renewed support at the lower level and was quoted further 
higher by Rs 3.90 followed by PSO, Elite Modaraba, Bankers Equity, 
Fazal Textiles, Kohinoor Power, Ebrahim Energy and several others.
    
BOC Pakistan, which rose by Rs 70 overnight came in for selling at the 
higher level and was marked down by Rs 55 on turnover of only 200 
shares. It was followed by Frontier Sugar and Packages, which suffered

<a name="thei">The informer informed</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee

HAJI Mohammed Akram, federal secretary of the redundant ministry of 
information, the ministry that neither informs nor itself bothers to 
be informed, came visiting. He opened with a four, arriving dead on 
time.
    
Akram had either displeased Nawaz or tried to be too independent, so 
he was shunted into a siding and made an OSD. Benazir brought him back 
in from the cold, for which he is surely expected to be grateful. For 
his sins, he has been put in the slot formerly occupied by the glib 
Hussain Haqqani, now put out to lurk in the wings, in the HBFC.
    
Secretary Akram must be a relatively honest man, for he was unable to 
propagate the government line without blushing. He was also keen to 
hear where the people of Karachis priorities lay. So, once again, I 
played the old worn record.
    
Extra-judicial killings: No one unconnected with the government has 
any doubt that they are engineered and executed by those shadowy 
bodies known as the agencies. Even the US government is fully aware 
of what is happening and has expressed its displeasure and its firm 
hope that they will cease. This, of course, provoked Benazir into 
pronouncing that it was interference in our internal affairs  
rather like a patient on a life-support system telling his doctor to 
get lost.
    
Liberty: Second only to life. A citizens liberty is no longer 
dependent upon the laws of the land. It depends entirely on the whims 
of the police Station House Officers who have bought their stations, 
as confirmed by none other than President Leghari. These law 
enforcement men, either to satiate greed or to satisfy a high-up, 
pick up whomsoever they choose, and detain them for as long as 
fourteen days at one stretch.
    
One case in point is that of Ghulam Hussain Unnar. This man was 
remanded in custody for almost two years, and implicated in 61 cases. 
When the remand for this last case expired on December 17, the 
government decided not to implicate him in a 62nd, and he is now free 
of that cycle. His bail application in the sedition case filed against 
him by the Sindh government was heard on the 19th in the Supreme Court 
by Justice Mamoon Kazi sitting with Justice Jehangir Bashiri and they 
have released him. Now, if the jail superintendent (who is directly 
controlled by the high-ups), plays fair, Unnar should be home and 
dry.
    
Unnar may be lucky, but there are hundreds who are not, who continue 
to be picked up from streets and houses, held in custody, and released 
only on payment of thousands of rupees. The head of state is aware of 
all this, yet he can do nothing to get rid of the 20-odd SHOs who 
terrorise the people of this city.
    
Inflation: Now for the stomach. The basics and necessities are up by 
at least 30 per cent. Everyone laughs at the government figure of 10 
per cent.
    
MoUs: A jingle doing the rounds in town sums these up: Napoleon met 
his Waterloo, Babar met his Khajjiloo, and Benazir met her Gordonwoo.
    
The Board of Investment: This department is part of the prime 
ministers secretariat and is manned by men whose credibility thus has 
to be doubtful. The BoI advertisements in the Press project very 
different amounts as having been invested in the country during 1994-
95. On October 21, one boasted of investments totalling $1,532 
million. Nine days later, on October 30, another raised this figure to 
$1,553 million. The World Bank does not take these figures seriously, 
and neither do we. Could the Information Secretary let us have a 
breakdown of how much money came for investment in the stock market, 
how much of it, plus the capital gains made, has flown away, and who 
has put what in the ground, where and when?
    
Reserves: We are constantly being told that we have adequate reserves 
of over $1 billion, which is belied by the fact that the government is 
in the market sounding the international banks, seeking a short-term 
syndicated emergency loan of $200 million to be drawn before December 
24.
    
Government ham-handedness: I asked Secretary Akram whether he knew of 
the manner in which the CBR had ordered the sealing of the Emirates 
Bank. He said he did.
    
I told him that after reading my column on the subject (Nov. 30) the 
Collector of Central Excise, Karachi, Ataullah Khan wrote to me 
justifying his stand, with which I do not agree. However, I was 
impressed by the heading of his letter, Taqat ka Nasha or Tyranny of 
the Printed Word and its ending: I do hope ... the next time you 
have a story about our department you will be kind enough to ascertain 
the facts from us before you announce your judgment in your columns 
lest an innocent man should become the victim of the tyranny of the 
printed word.
    
I went to meet him. I asked why, before sealing the bank, he had not 
obtained a clearance from the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan; 
or why, if he wanted to sort out the disputed legal opinion, he had 
not sought a clarification from the relevant quarters. I asked whether 
he knew what percentage of his officers and men was corrupt. He gave 
me a cautious correct answer, Over fifty per cent. This can mean 
anything from 51 to 100 per cent. I also asked if he was aware that 
one of his officers had requested an international bank for a 
preferred credit card, and when the bank told him that it could only 
be given to someone earning over Rs 50,000 per month, the man had 
replied that officially he did not earn that amount but unofficially 
earned ten times as much. Ataullah did not know, but said it was quite 
possible.
    
I also told Secretary Akram that the behaviour of the State Bank 
Governor was a matter of great regret. A strong Governor, on hearing 
that the Emirates Bank had been sealed without his permission, would 
have walked over to the bank, next door, and with his own hands broken 
the seal, taking full responsibility for the consequences. This would 
have created confidence and stalled the run on foreign exchange 
accounts. It is unfortunate that the inquiry into this mess-up is 
being conducted by Qazi Aleemullah of Islamabad, the phook-master. The 
guilty up there are likely to go scot free.
    
I suggested to Akram that he impress upon those really responsible in 
isolated Islamabad that they must ensure that Customs and Excise and 
FIA hounds do not hound the banks without first getting clearance 
from the State Bank Governor. When a country is financially down, 
anything to do with money or banks or loans has to be handled with kid 
gloves.
    
The judiciary: Our civilian martial law administrator  president and 
later prime minister, our martial law presidents and our other 
presidents and prime ministers have all done their best to curtail and 
hinder the liberty of the individual and to diminish the independence 
of the judiciary. Some have amended the Constitution to suit 
themselves, some have amended the laws and rules. Today, three out of 
four of the countrys High Courts are headed by Acting Chief 
Justices, appointed by the issuance of mere notifications, who can be 
toppled from their high chairs by other notifications which can be 
issued without giving any notice, and without assigning any reason. 
How secure can the ACJs feel and how independently can they act?
    
I asked Akram whether he was aware of the fascistic manner in which 
the family of the Chief Justice of Pakistan had recently been treated, 
of how one of the amicii curiae in the Judges case is being 
intimidated. He nodded. I asked whether he was aware of the underlying 
objective. Being a suffering bureaucrat, he did not hear the question.
    
It is indeed a matter of regret that, whilst an important case, the 
1995 Judges Case, is being argued in the Supreme Court, the government 
should have sought four adjournments (for reasons which can 
justifiably be termed as mere excuses), the fourth being the Attorney-
Generals submission that he would be away attending a conference in 
Tokyo on the subject of money laundering. What is the real reason for 
his going? To instruct the rest of the world? Or to learn how it is 
done?
    
On December 20, whilst the manner of the appointment of judges and the 
question of the independence of the judiciary is under consideration 
in the Supreme Court, the Prime Minister, that day in Karachi, invited 
all the judges of the Sindh High Court to meet her over lunch. Was 
this proper? Should the judges have risen an hour and a half before 
time, and trooped off? Could they not have declined the invitation, as 
did the first Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sir Abdur Rashid, who under 
somewhat similar circumstances said No to Prime Minister Liaquat Ali 
Khan?

<a name="refe">Reference your job application</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Naseer Ahmad

KARACHI, Dec. 22: You are a graduate and want to get a clerical job? 
What for, when you have a multiple choice. For example, you may do a 
six-month training course in gardening, driving, masonry, carpentry, 
tailoring, etc, and become an artisan.

These and such several other fantastic choices are offered in a 
brochure sent to those aspiring to become clerks across the country in 
response to their job applications sent several months ago to various 
government departments.

A section of the colour brochure, written in Urdu, with the prime 
ministers picture on top, reads: Under the sincere leadership of 
Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, the peoples government 
has been trying day in and day out to seek every possible solution to 
the unemployment problem. Like you, around 650,000 people have applied 
for employment in government departments, details of which are 
preserved in the computer. But the number of jobs in provincial and 
federal government departments is limited. They can hardly accommodate 
100,000 persons in a year. If you are a candidate for a government 
job, you will have to wait for a long time for your turn to get a job 
commensurate with your qualifications.

In view of this situation and to solve your problem immediately, the 
government of Pakistan offers opportunities for you to earn an 
honourable living and thus take part in a holy war against 
joblessness.

A postcard accompanying the brochure asks candidates to tick an option 
and mail it to Islamabad. As soon as the card is received back, the 
department concerned will contact you and provide you with necessary 
details, the brochure adds.

A report on Oct. 25 stated that the government had lifted the ban on 
all available jobs in Sindh with immediate effect. On Dec. 16 the 
Punjab chief minister declared that there was no ban on jobs. And on 
Dec. 18 Arif Nakai actually ordered that all vacancies in grades 1-15 
be filled up within 15 days and on merit.

Nobody is sure whether the ban is still in place. Various departments 
individually announce the lifting of the ban, as the Karachi Electric 
Supply Corporation did last week.

It is, however, difficult for job-seeking graduates to reconcile with 
the new situation. They want white-collar jobs and are not yet 
prepared to go through the hassle of formalities to get a small loan 
or to get themselves trained as gardeners, masons, drivers or 
hairdressers.

There are certainly not only 650,000 jobless people in the country. 
Their number runs into millions. The governments candid admission 
that it cannot provide them with an opportunity to earn a decent 
living has shattered their dreams. Earlier governments, too, had been 
battling with the unemployment problem unsuccessfully. But they had 
kept the hopes alive. If our present economic planners have only as 
much to offer as they have done in the brochure, they have just 
disappointed the hopefuls.

There are fears that even if the ban is virtually lifted those 
depending solely on their merit will not get jobs and instead those 
who have connections in right places will rob them of their right. 
Reports suggest that lists have already been compiled to accommodate a 
maximum number of political workers in government jobs.

<a name="adep">A deplorable tendency</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial column

WEDNESDAYS attacks on the Sukkur and the Larkana bureau offices of a 
Sindhi daily and the burning of copies of the paper snatched from 
news-stands and hawkers in several other cities and towns of Sindh are 
as deplorable as they are disturbing. The concern on this score is 
heightened by the fact that such incidents speak of a growing tendency 
among political, ethnic and sectarian activists to rough up newsmen to 
attack newspaper offices if they happen to disapprove reports of, 
however unjustifiably, certain reports or comments relating to their 
activities. That such reactions are against the norms and values of a 
democratic society and civilised conduct is no concern of the 
practitioners of such intolerance and extremism. It is a matter of the 
deepest concern that since the government lifted the restrictions 
under the notorious Press and Publications Ordinance, intolerance of 
dissent and differences of opinion among various parties, groups and 
factions has been coming increasingly under pressure from militants 
loyal to various political and fictional groups.

Journalists in Karachi, where political and fictional polarisation is 
most virulent and pervasive, know only too well what it means working 
in an environment of hate and prejudice. They frequently come under 
attack from one or the other feuding faction or group in the course of 
their professional duties or suffer being caught in the cross-fire of 
a violent clash. The Karachi offices of a Lahore-based group of 
newspapers was targeted in a rocket attack in June. More recently, the 
premised of a local English daily come under intense firing by masked 
gunmen belonging to a particular ethnic party. The whole attitude is 
altogether un-called for since an offended party can always demand a 
retraction of an impugned report or a denial or a clarification to be 
printed, or seek redress through legal action.

Even more deplorable have been the increasing instances of excesses 
against reporters and Press photographers by various law enforcement 
agencies, including the police and the Rangers.

There have been instances of journalists being beaten up by the police 
within the premises of the Sindh Assembly. Hundreds of newsmen from 
all over Sindh, joined by representatives of journalists organisations 
of Karachi, Lahore and Quetta, staged a protest demonstration in 
Hyderabad in September to protest against the high-handiness of the 
law enforcement agencies against some members of the Press.

Of course, freedom of the Press cannot be stretched to cover 
sensationalisation, deliberate distortions or reporting comments and 
other writings calculated to scandalise, defame or denigrate. But 
equally regrettable is a tendency not to put up with a point of view 
other than ones own or accept plurality  of opinion as an 
unchangeable fact of democratic life. For this there has to be a 
healthy respect for democratic norms and principles and Press freedom. 
Where false or malicious reporting or defamatory writings are 
concerned, the aggrieved party can always seek redress by means of 
retraction or rebuttal or through lawful means. But to try to resort 
to violence to browbeat to newspaper in an attempt to influence its 
policy is most reprehensible and has to be discouraged in every 
possible way. Unless the government and the enlightened sections of 
society join in a converted move to fight intolerance and extremism at 
every level, the current trends will make a mockery of freedom of 
expression and other basic values of our democratic polity.

<a name="livi">Living with American influence</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Gen Khalid Mahmud Arif (retd)

HENRY KISSINGER once told Agha Shahi that it was dangerous for a 
country to oppose the US and fatal to befriend her. Many knowledgeable 
people in Pakistan will share Kissingers assessment.

That the US policies promoted Americas own national interests in 
Pakistan and elsewhere should have been taken for granted. The 
Pakistani leaders were themselves to blame if they misread 
Washingtons real motives.

The future is more important than the past. Our failures in the 
yester-year should have prompted us to exercise greater vigilance in 
formulating policy options for the future. Instead, our leaders repeat 
past errors and seek external crutches to prolong their rule. They 
expose their own inadequacy when they project the small mole of the 
Brown Amendment as a mountain of success in an attempt to lull the 
people of Pakistan into a self-deception. Capitalising on their 
weakness, the foreign powers offer unsolicited advice. One example:

On December 6, 1995, the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defence for 
Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, Bruce Riedel, while making a 
policy statement before the House Committee on International Relations 
said: The Department of Defence attempts to build bridges of trust 
(in South Asia) through the strengthening of our bilateral defence 
relationships and increasing our military-to-military cooperation 
within established limitation. He then made some specific remarks on 
the US policy objectives in Pakistan and in South Asia. Excerpts:

The bilateral US-India security arrangement, concluded in January 
1995, covers defence cooperation in multi-directional fields; The 
bottom line is that US-Indian defence ties are better now than at any 
time in the last 30 years.  * Despite the Pressler Amendment the US-
Pakistani military relations have remained surprisingly cordial.

The Brown Amendment does not permit an arms supply relationship but 
it does permit us to provide limited military assistance to Pakistan 
in areas of importance to us  peacekeeping, anti-terrorism and 
narcotics.

Military-to-military contacts and the IMET programme will enable us 
to engage the Pakistani military more effectively.

We have no plans or intention to deliver the Pakistani F-16s and are 
seeking to resolve this issue by selling the aircraft to a third 
country and returning the proceeds to Pakistan.

The willingness of the South Asia countries  particularly India and 
Pakistan  to commit their militaries in significant numbers to 
peacekeeping and other operational missions is an important factor.

Pakistan lies at the intersection of three often unstable regions: 
South Asia, Southwest Asia and Central Asia.

The testimony acknowledges (a) Pakistans geo-strategic importance in 
a troubled region and, without an open admission, concedes it a role 
in promoting peace and prosperity in it; (b), the US surprise at the 
continuing cordiality of the bilateral military-to-military relations 
between the two countries, despite the Pressler Amendment, is a 
backhanded compliment to Pakistan; (c), the hidden US agenda of 
engaging the Pakistani military more effectively is transparent enough 
to see through Americas real game: using the military clout to 
influence Pakistans political decisions; (d) the F-16s purchased by 
Pakistan will be sold to a third country and the proceeds (not the 
amount actually paid) will be refunded to it; and (e) the military aid 
will remain suspended and only such limited military assistance will 
be provided that promotes the US policy objectives. This should be a 
cause for worry not celebration in this country.

The testimony describes the positions of India and Pakistan on the 
nuclear issue as unpalatable but is silent on whether the US 
intended to adopt an even-handed approach in capping their 
destructive capability. Perhaps not. The US bias in favour of India 
is too obvious to miss.

In a another development, by calling the Karachi situation extremely 
disturbing the US expressed its deep concern over the escalating 
cycle of violence in Karachi and particularly over the sharp increase 
in reported extra-judicial killings, extortion and custodial deaths by 
security forces. The Foreign Office termed the US statement an 
interference in the internal affairs of Pakistan. Significantly, the 
Prime Minister has herself remained silent on this subject. She 
remembers that not long ago, while in opposition, she had herself 
requested for the US interference in Pakistans internal affairs. Why 
should our leaders wash their dirty political linen in foreign 
countries baffles the people of Pakistan.

Despite the US denial, the allegation that America meddles in 
Pakistans internal affairs and capitalises on the latters internal 
polarisation rings true. No less true is the fact that Pakistans 
short-sighted approach and its willingness to accept foreign advice on 
issues of substance have led to foreign interference in its internal 
affairs. Many a time the Foreign Office implements the policies that 
are made elsewhere. The reasons for this self-surrender lie in our 
dirty political backyard. The lesson of history is unambiguous. A 
government that loses the confidence of the people cannot be sustained 
by any foreign country, not matter if it is a superpower.

The military-to-military contacts in the professional field, within 
the government-approved limits, are desirable. However, Pakistans 
relations with other countries, the Kashmir dispute, the nuclear 
policy, anti-narcotics stance, and participation in the UN 
peacekeeping operations are essentially political issues that fall 
outside the military purview. Bruce Riedels policy statement creates 
an impression that the US aims at using the military connection to 
influence Pakistans political decisions. To involve the Pakistani 
military in the national political quagmire will further weaken the 
already infirm political structure in this country, besides harming 
the military itself.

<a name="warl">Warlords rule, OK?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Mazdak

VERY soon after the birth of Bangladesh in 1971, Henry Kissinger 
called the new state an international basket case. He was proved 
wrong by events. Bangladesh today, despite its enormous political and 
economic problems, is a going concern.

The same cannot be said of Pakistan. More worrying than the issues of 
inflation and stagnation are the long-term implications of our 
consistent under-investment in the social infrastructure. And even 
more troubling still are the systemic failure and moral decay that 
have come to characterise and define Pakistan over the last quarter 
century. Institutions have been devastated and the acid of corruption 
has eaten deep into the vitals of the state. Above this wasteland 
looms the spectre of poor governance. Indeed, the crisis of leadership 
we have been witnessing for years is rapidly assuming disastrous 
proportions: inexorably, we are being sucked into the black hole of 
failed states.

If this view seems excessively bleak, consider the facts. According to 
the World Bank, Bangladesh spent 10 per cent of its budget on defence 
in 1990 against Pakistans 31 per cent. The result of this difference 
in priorities was that Bangladesh was able to allocate 11.2 per cent 
of its government expenditure to education, 4.8 per cent to health and 
8 per cent to housing; Pakistans outlay on these social sectors was 2 
per cent, 0.7 percent 3.1 percent, respectively. If our erstwhile 
eastern wing is able to maintain these rates of expenditure over a 
period of time, it is inevitable that it will overtake us very soon. 
Already, it has far healthier foreign exchange reserves, an inflation 
rate that is under control and its textile manufacturers are giving 
our exporters a tough time, despite the fact that they have to import 
cotton. BDs budgetary deficit in 1990 was only 0.4 per cent of GNP 
against 7.2 per cent for Pakistan. Above all, it has managed to reduce 
its population growth rate to 2.1 per cent.

None of this is to suggest that Bangladesh is heaven on earth. Far 
from it. The endless political jockeying for power in Dhaka resembles 
nothing as much as the feuding frenzy in Islamabad. This unbridled and 
unseemly ambition is having the same destabilising effect on the 
economy and the polity as it does here. Indeed, at times the tragic-
comedy being played out in Bangladesh seems a mirror image of events 
in Pakistan.

But at least seen from afar, there seems to be a concerted, bipartisan 
effort to make Bangladesh a modern state. This is not true for 
Pakistan. Despite the endless bombast about our becoming an Asian 
tiger very soon, this wishful thinking is neither reflected in the 
actions of our leaders nor in budgetary allocations.

But more scary than the unravelling economy is the collapse of our 
institutional framework. Throughout recorded history in China, 
whenever the central governments hold over the countryside has 
weakened, warlords have emerged to fill the vacuum; they would collect 
taxes, raise armies of mercenaries and prey on travellers.

This last happened early this century after the collapse of the 
empire; it is happening now in Afghanistan and Somalia. In Pakistan, 
largely because of the cohesion of the armed forces, this kind of 
fragmentation has mercifully not occurred so far, barring the hold 
tribal chieftains exercise over their turf in the Frontier and 
Balochistan, and, to a lesser extent, by dacoits in parts of rural 
Sindh. In Karachi, the sector commanders of the two factions of the 
MQM rule supreme in their respective areas, wielding the power of life 
and death over the unfortunate citizens whose destinies they control.

More insidious and damaging than these warlords are the functionaries 
of the state who have carved out spheres of influence by virtue of 
their jobs. The world over, civil servants enjoy certain powers 
delegated to them to enable them carry out their duties.

But these powers are always subject to checks and balances. In 
Pakistan, however, the concepts of deterrence and accountability have 
been eroded to such an extent that bureaucrats, especially at the more 
senior level, no longer feel they have any public responsibility or 
that they are answerable to anybody.

In a sense, they have become autonomous warlords within the hierarchy, 
responsive only to directives from the PMs Secretariat, the 
Presidency and occasionally, from the minister concerned. Very few 
civil servants perform their duties because they are supposed to, they 
act only if there is pressure, a sifarish or a bribe involved.

I remember going to the police headquarters in 1963 to get my 
learners licence. A couple of months later, I went off for my driving 
test before I was the proud owner of a pucca driving licence. Today, I 
could not imagine asking my son to go through the same drill because I 
know only too well the ordeal he would be subjected to.

This small example can be multiplied by a hundred to get an idea of 
the institutional deterioration that has occurred since the creation 
of Pakistan. Today, the merit of a case or an individual counts for 
nothing in Pakistans officialdom, and functionaries and politicians 
in power exercise their personal whim in taking a decision. The same 
set of rules can be bent in any direction to justify any particular 
action  or lack of it.

This anarchy has emerged out of a combination of constantly falling 
standards of governance and the steep decline in public morality. 
Today, the average civil servant thinks first of his own career and 
bank balance, secondly of his extended family, clan or tribe, and 
finally of his public responsibility. A symbiotic relationship between 
politicians and bureaucrats has developed over time whereby the former 
rely on civil servants to carry out their legal and illegal orders. In 
return, elected leaders grant their subordinates immunity from 
accountability.

In any case, few politicians ever bother to study an issue or problem 
and are thus at the mercy of their secretaries. Once bureaucrats have 
satisfied their political masters, they are free to act as they 
please. In such a situation, public interest goes by default as 
neither politician nor bureaucrat wants to be distracted from the 
pursuit of his own personal interest.

As I argued last week, change can only come from the top. 
Unfortunately, our ruling elites are too preoccupied feathering their 
own nests to spare a thought to a duty higher than the one they owe 
their own immediate families. This attitude of everyone for himself, 
and devil take the hindmost has permeated society so thoroughly that 
everybody in a position of authority misuses it to his own end.

Many people advocate yet more laws to somehow improve matters. But as 
Saint-Just put it: Too many laws, too few examples.

<a name="cred">Credit squeeze for farmers</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

SINCE the State Bank has made lending by the Agricultural Development 
Bank of Pakistan (ADBP) conditional on recovery of past loans, the 
farming community is facing difficulty in getting credit, an essential 
input for agricultural operation. Right from the stage of preparing 
soil to harvesting, the farmer needs credit for hiring the tractor, 
purchasing seed, fertiliser and insecticide and running tubewells. 
With prices of agricultural products having risen in recent years, the 
financial position of big farmers who have plenty of surplus of cash 
crops has considerably improved. At the same time, the small farmer 
who has a nominal surplus for the market finds himself squeezed by 
rising prices of inputs on the one hand, and scarcity of credit on the 
other. A large part of the resources of the ADBP is stuck up in unpaid 
loans outstanding against big landlords who, through the use of their 
political clout, have been avoiding repayment over long periods and 
seem to have no intention to clear them up. These stuck-up loans have 
crippled the capacity of the ADBP to advance fresh loans. The main 
victims of this credit squeeze are small farmers who cultivate about 
66 per cent of the total farm land. Although the bank claims to have 
set aside 75 per cent of the funds for small farmers, the overall 
resources have drastically dwindled because of defaults.

According to reports, the ADBP does not find itself in a position to 
meet the credit needs of the farmers relating to the rabi season. The 
outstanding advances of the ADBP in 1994-95 amounted to Rs 50 billion, 
of which Rs 16 billion was said to fall in the category of long 
defaults. About 90 per cent of the bank's loanable funds were obtained 
from the State Bank, while the rest were drawn from credit line and 
loans from international agencies and on a bilateral basis from 
friendly countries. At the beginning of the current fiscal year the 
State Bank allocated an additional one billion rupees to the ADBP to 
be released in two tranches of Rs 500 million each. It refused to make 
further allocation and left the ADBP to fall back upon its own 
resources to be raised through loan recoveries and mobilisation of 
rural savings. Similar warnings were administered by foreign donors 
too. As the ADBP had always remained dependent entirely on SBP 
allocations and its operations were restricted only to channelling 
allocated funds to the farmers, the potential of augmenting resources 
through mobilisation of rural savings always remained neglected.

The strict enforcement of SBP's decision and the resultant financial 
constraints this time compelled the ADBP to launch a vigorous and 
nation-wide recovery campaign. The claim of the bank that up to 
December 14 it recovered Rs 3.4 billion which is 34.5 per cent more 
than last year, does not say how much of this amount really related to 
stuck up loans. The bank authorities' claim that they have now 
assigned top priority to recoveries and are determined to refer the 
cases of influential defaulters to the speedy banking tribunals would 
lack credibility until they substantiate it with convincing evidence 
in the form of enhanced recoveries. The bank has also asked the Sindh 
government to assist in the recovery of loans. Similar requests may 
have been made to other provincial governments as well.

Provincial government's assistance is necessary because the execution 
of court decrees cannot take place without the active involvement of 
the revenue staff. In Sindh defaults are said to be particularly 
heavy, or something like one third of the total, and recovery is 
highly unsatisfactory. The provincial governments must extend 
necessary cooperation in this regard. The banking system and the 
national economy cannot be salvaged from the current crisis unless 
defaulted loans are recovered. Recovery of farm loans is a 
particularly tricky affair because many of the debtors have political 
clout and links and, if pressed hard, are capable of making endless 
trouble for government, federal or provincial.

<a name="corr">Corruption under attack</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Sultan Ahmed

A STRONG anti-corruption tidal wave is sweeping the world. It is not 
confined to Asian states or Third World but includes several first 
world states as well. And it is not the small fry only which has been 
subjected to punishment; the persons at the top are facing the same 
charges.  

In Mexico, former President Carlos Salinas who made history by signing 
the NAFTA with the U.S. and Canada and was a serious candidate for the 
post of chief of the new World Trade Organisation has fled the country 
following the charge of murder of his intended successor Luis Donaldo 
Colosi and several other charges against him. His sister-in-law Mrs 
Raul Salinas was arrested recently in Geneva while trying to cash a 
cheque of 84 million dollars in a Swiss bank, while another secret 
bank account with 24 million dollars was uncovered in London.
    
In Belgium, Willy Caes has to resign in October as secretary general 
of NATO following disclosure about his corrupt conduct while he was 
his countrys Economy Minister.
    
In Italy, several prime ministers and many ministers are behind bars 
or have fled the country for fear of being jailed on corruption 
charges following the continuing Operation Clean hands initiated by 
courageous Italian magistrates.
    
In Japan, several prime ministers had to quit, over the years, on 
corruption charges. Now former labour minister Toshio Yamaguchi has 
been arrested for his involvement in illegal bank loans from two 
failed financial institutions.
    
Compared to that, in countries like Nigeria and Congo strong men rule 
with all the abuses such systems breed and have no fear of ouster or 
punishment. And what are we to do in Pakistan which has been dubbed 
the third most corrupt country in the world by Transparency 
International based in Berlin, after Indonesia and China? If Italys 
magistrates have been able to perform great miracles and jail some of 
the most powerful men in their country, Malik Qasims more imposing 
Federal Anti-corruption Committee has failed to achieve anything. In 
fact, the FACCs struggle has become more of a comic opera or shadow 
boxing with one hand tied behind the back. How long should this futile 
exercise continue with powers only to bark and not bite?
    
There is more measure of corruption in almost every government in the 
world. But the issue is whether that gets exposed and if it does, 
whether the corrupt is punished or not. It is not enough that the 
corrupt is relieved from his office along with the vast loot he 
collected. It is far more important for the man to be stripped of his 
ill-gotten wealth so that he does not become a big industrialist or a 
politician as it does happen here.
    
In the 1960s finance minister Shoaib used to dismiss corruption as the 
oil which made the administrative machinery move fast. But now the 
dimension of the corruption is so vast and so all-pervasive, it clogs 
and fouls up the entire administrative machinery. And those who are 
not corrupt are becoming an exception rather than the norm, with more 
honest persons defecting to the ranks of the corrupt every week. We 
just cannot afford that in a country in which the share of the wealthy 
in the national income is increasing rapidly and of the poor declining 
steadily.
    
If the government is serious about checking corruption this cat and 
mouse game should come to an end. The fact is that if the FACC cannot 
get the corrupt punished and deprived of their vast illegal gains, it 
is not able to hold proper enquiries either. Most of the departments 
in which corruption is detected are not ready to come up with full 
disclosures or cooperate with the FACC to get to the fact, and all the 
facts. Instead the tendency is to keep the FACC away from their 
offices as much as they can or mislead it.
    
While the FACC can only make recommendations on the basis of its 
findings to the Prime Minister, the latter has not punished or 
reprimanded the departments or corporations which block FACCs 
enquiries. As a result, if the FACC comes up with a report that is not 
wholly factual, the department concerned is quick to point out to the 
PM that the report is defective, more so if the head of the department 
has access to the PM or her secretariat.
    
The FACC, for example, has been knocking at many doors to find out the 
real causes for the defaulted bank loans of Rs 80 billion, which are 
now reported to have swollen to Rs 100 billion. It is anxious to know 
how much collusion was there on the part of senior bank executives who 
gave such loans without collateral or on other unfair basis. But the 
FACC is being held back in the name of secrecy of bank accounts. The 
fact is that if the loans were being serviced regularly or the 
repayment rescheduled properly, the FACC will not be in the picture, 
and bank secrecy would be respected. But when the defaults are very 
large, and have been for long periods, and some of the bank executives 
had colluded in giving improper loans, and did not try to recover them 
earlier, the FACC has the right to step in a period in which one 
junior executive Leeson could get the famous Barings Bank closed and 
sold off, and a Japanese employee of the Daiwa Bank in the US could 
bring about its liquidation.
    
The federal cabinet had on September 19 decided that officers in grade 
20 and above should continue to be asked to file their statements of 
assets and liabilities, and a commission would be set up to scrutinise 
the assets of those officials. The cabinet also noted that while the 
officers were required to file statements of their assets annually, 
there was no need to investigate them, and so the proposed commission 
would pay attention to this aspect, said the cabinet spokesman after 
the meeting.
    
The FACC took the decision seriously and wrote letters to all 
ministries, divisions and autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, and 
asked for details of the movable and immovable assets of officers in 
grade 17 and above. At the same time the Chief Election Commissioner 
asked the Senators and members of the national and provincial 
assemblies to file their statements of assets and liabilities which 
they had failed to do after the 1993 election with September 30, 1994 
as the last deadline.
    
But at a recent cabinet meeting the officials with plenty to hide, and 
in no mood to be answerable to anyone, prevailed and the cabinet 
decided the officials would continue to file their statements as usual 
and no one would scrutinise that. And that is a total mockery of the 
whole process. If there is no fear of scrutiny of the statements, the 
officers can say almost nothing and get away with it, as in the past. 
And clearly the ghost of the commission proposed was laid to rest 
forthwith.
    
After such an exercise to combat bureaucratic corruption, what is the 
use of continuing with the FACC of 12 members who has Lt Gen Syed 
Zakir Ali Zaidi as consultant? The nexus between bureaucratic and 
political corruption will now become stronger and flourish. We cannot 
afford to let this cancer in our body politic thrive despite the 
critical damage it does to the economic structure of the country, but 
it thrives.
    
Corruption is not only taking money home from the office or obtaining 
large sums for favours done or promised, but also gross waste of 
public money. See the ghastly manner in which expensive cars are 
misused by the rulers and civil servants. The Punjab chief ministers 
House is reported to have 90 cars. And cars in the Sindh CMs House 
has not come down appreciably since the 120 Jam Sadiq Ali had as CM.
    
And look at the number of TV sets, VCRs, dish antennas distributed by 
the PTV to various officials and politicians. If this is not an act of 
outright corruption practised too blatantly what else is it?
    
The need of the times is not for a FACC which is brushed aside by 
almost everyone in authority but a proper anti-corruption commission 
headed, possibly, by a retired chief justice of Pakistan with full 
contempt powers, and the power to prescribe punishment which includes 
total forfeiture of the fruits of corruption of politicians and 
officers alike.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="abba">Abbasi & Burki blamed for PCB and cricket mess</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Khan Mohammad

After the Zimbabwe teams tour of Pakistan in Dec. 93 the Board of 
Control for Cricket in Pakistan was superseded during early 1994 by 
the President of Pakistan. An Ad hoc committee headed by Javed Burki, 
former captain of Pakistan with Arif Abbasi and Dr Zafar Altaf as the 
members was formed. This committee continued running the affairs of 
the board for about 14 months after which it was replaced by the 
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).

What necessitated the sacking of the Board with its President the 
former Chief Justice of Pakistan Dr Nasim Hasan Shah and Honorary 
Secretary Mr Shahid Rafi is still shrouded in mystery. However the 
Honorary Treasurer of the same board not only came out unscathed but 
was elevated to be the member of the Ad hoc committee. 

It was generally believed that the action against the Board was 
engineered by Messrs. Arif Abbasi and Javed Burki. Cricketers like me 
were extremely disappointed to find out that though the names of the 
Cricket Board had been changed but the three members of the Ad hoc 
committee took its control with greater authority and all the 
constitutional backing. Arif Abbasi has manoeuvred for himself the all 
powerful position of chief executive. Javed Burki is adviser to the 
President of Pakistan on cricket while Dr Zafar Altaf is the chairman 
of the selection committee. The position of the President of the Board 
has been replaced by a ceremonial chairman who has hardly any power 
except to act like one. The C.E.O. is the hub and centre of authority 
with an excessively high salary without any check or control except 
perhaps that of the President of Pakistan and whose adviser happened 
to be Javed Burki. These two I believe, are cousins.

Isnt it an ideal situation to continue the dubious and questionable 
activities and dealings which have devastated and destroyed the 
Pakistan cricket team.

Let me now recount some of their short-sighted policies which have 
brought anarchy in the Board and the Pakistan and reduced the team to 
such a sorry state: 1. After the conclusion of the tour of the 
Zimbabwe team in Pakistan, there was a revolt against the captain 
Wasim Akram by a group of his team mates headed by Waqar Younis (as 
reported in the press) to remove the former. The Ad hoc committee, 
instead of taking action against these who were guilty of the action 
against a duly appointed captain, played into the hands of its 
perpetrators. Salim Malik was appointed captain as a compromise 
candidate acceptable to the rebels to avoid and embarrassing 
situation. It was a sort-sighted policy which encouraged the schemers 
while the captain was made a hostage to the group who succeeded in 
renouncing Wasim Akram. 2. The Ad hoc committee and later on the same 
old trio kept on changing captains and vice-captains and other 
officials at will. These appointments were dished out perhaps as 
personal favours. Otherwise how can you constantly keep making such 
changes if the same were made on merits? Here are some specific 
examples. Moin Khan was made Pakistan Captain in the last Sharjah Cup 
who won the match against India but unfortunately he fell sick and had 
to return home. He was replaced by Rameez Raja against Sri Lanka in 
Pakistan (27 August to 3 October 1995). Wasim Akram was recalled to 
lead in Australia and NZ while Amir Sohail has been suddenly elevated 
as a vice-captain. The joke is that all the three were made to play 
under each other thus creating unnecessary rivalry and friction among 
the team mates. 3. The managers and coaches, like the captains and 
vice-captains, have been given short shrift and summarily removed and 
disgraced. The cases of Majid Khan and Mushtaq are the recent 
examples. Similarly Intikhab Alam was disgraced after the South 
Africa/Zimbabwe tour on grounds of inefficiency and weakness of 
management yet he has been suddenly and mysteriously inducted in the 
team again for the Australian/NZ tours. 4. Billy Abaadullah was 
specially hired as an outstanding coach and manager with great fanfare 
by both the two great cricket brains Javed Burki and Arif Abbasi. 
But even this arrangement could hardly last one contractual term and 
that too with lots of controversies regarding payment of money. 5. 
There is now a recent report in the National/International media that 
the C.E.O. is going to hire coaches from England because according to 
him Khan Mohammed is not the best coach. But have I ever claimed in my 
life-long commitment as a professional coach that I am the best in the 
world? I have, however, always claimed and entitled to claim that I am 
one of the most highly qualified and experienced coaches from England 
and I have continued imparting coaching all my life in many countries 
of the world including Pakistan. English coaches have got their 
training exactly where I have done mine. But let me highlight why he 
wants to hire English coaches on such exorbitantly high charges. His 
PR and equation with English cricket set up is the reason. Thats how 
he has become a Member of the M.C.C. for which position many top 
cricketers of Pakistan have NOT been considered. 6. I am a 
professional coach and I am entitled to the professional fee as much 
as an English coach. But I have always fulfilled my contractual 
obligations without any bargaining. I have willingly accepted whatever 
terms were offered to me as a national duty because I have already 
given my sweat and blood to the Pakistan team as a spearhead bowler 
along with Fazal Mahmood and Mahmood Hussain. I carry the same love 
and loyalty for Pakistan team. But can you say the same about English 
coaches? Have they been able to produce better cricketers in England 
than what I produced in Pakistan, Test players like Wasim Akram, Salim 
Malik, Amir Malik, Ejaz Ahmed, Inzamamul Haq, Aqib Javed, Mushtaq 
Ahmed, Basit Ali, Asif Mujtaba, Mohsin Kamal etc... I have polished 
players like Ramiz Raja, Azim Hafiz, Sikander Bakht and a host of 
other first class cricketers in Pakistan besides creating a big bunch 
of local coaches to continue the job of coaching in my beloved 
country.
    
I have no objection if Pakistani authorities like Arif Abbasi and 
others who have hardly played first class cricket want to squander 
money to hire English coaches in foreign exchange and thereby earn the 
goodwill of English cricket authorities and earn their favours in 
exchange. But he has no business to malign and underrate me. He can do 
whatever he likes to damage Pakistan cricket which can easily be 
judged by our own teams performances since he has been in control in 
the Board through his political props and by inducting politicians in 
Pakistan cricket.
    
In a recent function in honour of England A team now touring Pakistan, 
he made a statement that in future Pakistan will never let Shakoor 
Rana and others like him to supervise Test matches in Pakistan. He 
made these remarks to appease and curry favour with English cricket 
authorities by denigrating our own umpires and humiliating Pakistan. 
He has conveniently forgotten that one of our Test class umpires, 
Khalid Aziz, (a former top grade first class cricketer) complained 
against Abbasi that he puts pressure on umpires to give patriotic 
decisions. Mr Arif Abbasi, as usual not only removed him from the 
panel but got him banned for life. He has also made a statement that 
he will hire English umpires to coach and impart training to our 
umpires. 7. Majid Khan, Mushtaq Mohammad and many others close to the 
PCB complain that Arif Abbasi meddles in every committee and sub-
committee including the selection committee. No wonder such lop-sided 
selections, changes and counter-changes are being effected and hence 
the obviously predictable poor and degrading performance of our team. 
8. While commenting on the judgment of the former Justice Fakhruddin 
G. Ibrahim declaring Salim Malik Not guilty of the charges made 
against him by the Australians observed that the alleged charges 
appeared to be concocted Mr. Arif Abbasi retorted I was expecting 
strong reaction from the Australian Board because nobody likes being 
told the truth especially crooked people Instead of using diplomatic 
language to soften the harsh words his comment served as an icing on 
the cake. He did not realise the damage that his intemperate words 
would do to Pakistan team nowadays touring Australia and New Zealand. 
9. The enquiry of the charges levelled by the Australian players 
against Malik was deliberately prolonged inordinately to please the 
ICC boss and the Australian authorities. 10. It is also commonly know 
that Arif Abbasi manipulates the media in such a manner that he takes 
the credit when things are shaping well while others take the blame 
when his foolish actions backfire and the results produced on the 
field are far from satisfactory. The rapid changes of captains, vice-
captions, coaches and managers, are bought about to indicate their 
failings when the team performs poorly.
    
In a recent press conference in the Cricket Boards HQ at Gaddafi 
Stadium Lahore on his return from England tour in connection with 
World Cup, he cleverly briefed them in his typical amiable style that 
the conjectures about his interference in the affairs of the selection 
committee are wrong. He impressed upon them that he never interferes 
in the team selection. Otherwise who does not know that Arif Abbasi 
does not only meddle in the affairs of the selection committee but 
other committees also? Who is making and unmaking captains, vice-
captains and other officials? Who appointed the selection committee?
    
There are in fact unending tales of Arif Abbasis mismanagement in 
Pakistan Cricket Board and its affairs being regularly reported in the 
national media. Every body knows who is responsible for bringing gloom 
and despair in Pakistan cricket, yet there is nobody who is in a 
position to take him to task due to his very strong political links 
among the top brass politicians of Pakistan. This is the reason why 
the former Test cricketers of Pakistan strongly protested and 
demonstrated against Mr Arif Abbasi prior to and after his appointment 
as C.E.O. of the PCB
    
Messrs Arif Abbasi and Javed Burki are the two officials of the Board 
who prolonged the agony of Mr Salim Malik and banned him from playing 
any competitive cricket even for his departmental team on the pretext 
that his case is sub judice while delaying the proceedings. By the 
time Salim was cleared, three captains, two vice-captains and a number 
of officials were sacked as if they were responsible for all the poor 
performances of the Pakistan team. It is these two cricketing genii, 
who destroyed the morale and self-esteem of Pakistani cricketers 
individually and as a team by their unprofessional and inept handling 
of the players and the various ticklish problems which confronted them 
during the period. 

In the month of March having taken action against Salim Malik, Javed 
Burki in a statement to the national press proudly mentioned that by 
taking action against Salim Malik, Pakistan cricket has been saved 
from becoming an international pariah or an outcast.

In conclusion it is my considered opinion as one of the senior most 
former Test cricketers and a professional cricket coach that to 
galvanise Pakistan cricket the first and the foremost action should be 
to remove Arif Abbasi to be replaced by a highly experienced, 
enlightened, educated and above all an upright former Test cricketer 
who is well versed in the complex subjects of administration and 
management.

<a name="mian">Miandad asks selectors to make up their minds</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 21: Javed Miandad stated that the Pakistan Cricket Board 
(PCB) and the National Selection Committee need to make up their mind 
regarding his selection in the World Cup party.
    
Miandad, out of action since December 1993, felt that a player is only 
included in the final lineup by the captain once he has complete faith 
in him. Similar is the case with me. The selectors must complete 
their homework by the end of this year. They should have confidence in 
me before picking me in the team.
    
A veteran of 124 Tests and 228 one-day internationals, Miandad, 
maintained that if the selectors or cricket administrators were 
thinking that they will be taking his trials in one-day Cup, they were 
wrong. They are mistaken. I am not playing in the One-day Cup because 
I want to give the selectors my trials. I am playing because I want to 
earn match practice which I am certainly lacking.
    
Miandad was of the view that trials are only taken of those cricketers 
who are border- line cases. Having played top level cricket for 17 
years, I dont think I need to show them my talent.
    
Miandad admitted that as far as he was concerned, he considers himself 
selected in the World Cup party. Whats the point of then including 
my name in the 20 probables? I never asked them to include my name? 
All I told them was that when I would be available, I would inform 
them. I have done that its upto the selectors to believe me or not.

Miandad dismissed impressions that the One-day Cup will be serving as 
an opportunity to prove his fitness and form. Besides that I need 
match practice, I am also available. I owe a lot to my bank. In 
addition to this, since I am ready to play in the World Cup, this is 
the last opportunity of earning as much chance as possible.

<a name="show">Miandad shows fitness of form</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Correspondent

FAISALABAD, Dec. 26: Those thinking that Javed Miandad might not be 
able to regain his lost form and fitness badly bit the dust when the 
former Pakistan captain steered Habib Bank to an exciting six-wicket 
victory over Karachi Whites in the Pool B match of the 15th National 
One-day Championship at the Iqbal Stadium.
    
Miandad hammered six boundaries and two sixes in his undefeated 74 
which came off 85 balls after the maestro occupied the crease for 92 
minutes.
    
Miandad, later adjudged Man-of-the-Match, showed glimpses of why he is 
considered a brilliant one-day batsman. He took cheeky singles and 
stroked the ball with the middle of the bat.
    
Miandad also proved his fitness when he remained in the field  
throughout Karachi Whites innings marshalling his fielders. He had 
gallant sprints after the ball and on a number of occasions dived to 
stop the ball. It was a tremendous sight to see a great batsman in 
full cry and at a time when a certain lobby is against his inclusion 
in the World Cup party.
    
Habib Bank, set a target of 203 for victory by Karachi Whites, were 
reeling at the ropes when Shakeel Ahmad (16), Sohail Miandad (3), and 
Shahid Nawaz (12) had returned to the pavilion with the scoreboard 
reading 55 in the 16th over.
    
Miandad came out, moving in confidence and the first ball he faced 
showed that he was out there to prove something. But when Mujahid 
Jamsheed departed in the next over to leave Habib Bank 68 for four in 
the 17th over, followers started thinking that Miandad will have to 
show his brilliance if he has to pull his bank out from the jaws of 
defeat.

Miandad did not disappoint his well wishers.
    
A great calculator he is, Miandad made a plan and not only followed 
it, also made wicketkeeper Tahir Rasheed follow it. Although after the 
conclusion of 30 overs the scoreboard read 89, Miandad by then was 
gaining confidence ball-by-ball.
    
Miandad played delightful and heart-stopping shots. His square cuts 
were as sweetly timed as were his cover-drives. His pulls and off-the-
toe shots were a treat to watch. But Miandad might not have been able 
to pull his side home if Tahir Rasheed had not helped him. Tahir 
scored an undefeated 57 from 72 balls with the aid of six hits to the 
fence.
    
Together with Miandad, Tahir put on 135 runs to the unbroken fifth 
wicket partnership.
    
Earlier, Karachi Whites 202 for seven in 45 overs revolved around 74 
by opener Malik Rasheed who struck nine boundaries in his 143-ball 
innings.
    
Test pacer Naveed Anjum picked up two wickets for 45 runs while Kabir 
Khan, Shahid Nawaz, Nadeem Ghauri and Akram Raza all picked up one 
wicket each.

<a name="nzle">N.Z. level one-day series against Pakistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed

AUCKLAND, Dec. 23: Pakistan failed to capitalise on their 2-1 lead in 
the four-match one-day series against New Zealand and in the end had 
to be content with a drawn series.

After being set an awesome 245 runs to win a match of 45 overs instead 
of 50 because of delayed start due to rain, Pakistan succumbed under 
pressure to be all out for 212 in 41.4 overs and conceded the match by 
32 runs to enable New Zealand draw the series.

They had entered the final one-day match at Eden Park aiming to finish 
the tour at a winning note but after asking New Zealand to bat, 
Pakistan bowled poorly and fielded atrociously to allow New Zealand 
make a match winning score. In nine overs Waqar Younus gave away 73 
runs for his three wickets of no consequence. Twenty-one extras in the 
innings spoiled the matter further.

In his first four overs Waqar Younus had given away 33 runs and yet he 
was allowed five more whereas Aqib Javed only bowled six and Mushtaq 
Ahmed seven which indeed was mind boggling. In fact this is how 
Pakistan lost the match.

Pakistans batting was very much reminiscent of New Zealands attempt 
in the third one-day to win the match by playing attacking cricket. 
New Zealand paid the price at the Basin reserve for being over 
ambitious and so did Pakistan at Eden Park.

In 10 overs Pakistans score was past 50 runs with Aamir Sohail and 
Ramiz Raja entertaining a crowd of 12,000 with blistering strokeplay. 
In 45 balls Aamir Sohail had made 37 with six fourths and a six off 
Chris Cairns before being caught at gully by Dipak Patel off Cairns.

Saleem Elahi, the only change in the Pakistan team for Ijaz Ahmed was 
dropped by Patel at long off when 4 off Gavin Larsen but was later 
given run out in controversial circumstances by the third umpire Evan 
Watkin.

One of the bails had been dislodged by the bowler Larsen before a 
direct throw from Nathan Astle hit the stumps. The bowler did not pull 
the stumps out with the ball in his hand according to the laws of the 
game which he should have Saleem Elahi was unlucky.

When Ramiz Raja was caught at third man off Nathan Astle for 46 in the 
22nd over and Inzamam-ul-Haq also fell off him and Basit Ali was run 
out without scoring by an Astle throw, the match was almost over as 
far as Pakistan was concerned.

Wickets continued to tumble. Wasim Akram drove straight into the hands 
of Astle off a delivery from Danny Morrison and Rashid Latif was 
bowled by Larsen to make Pakistan 146 for 7 in the 32nd over. Salim 
Malik, however, played his best innings of the tour to make 58 with 
four boundaries and three sixes to give Pakistan a little hope of 
reaching near the target. With Mushtaq Ahmed his partner for the 
eighth wicket he put on 42 runs but once the stand was broken and he 
was the ninth man out, the target was of no consequence as there were 
not many left to go for it.

New Zealand after being put in never missed any opportunity of picking 
up runs as Pakistan failed to restrict their brisk run-rate. Poor 
field placing has a lot to do with it. Singles and twos were there for 
the asking as the batsmen pushed and ran to keep the five runs over 
average well in control.

Bryan Young was caught at the wicket at 28 when 15 off Aqib Javed but 
Stephen Fleming and Craig Spearman added 60 runs for the second wicket 
to set New Zealand on course for a big score.

Spearmans 48 contained six fours and Fleming, who was caught by Wasim 
Akram off Aamir Sohail at mid-wicket for 38, added another quick 44 
runs for the third wicket with Parore. Cairns fell cheaply off Sohail 
but another solid stand of 59 between Parore and Roger Twose made New 
Zealand score look respectable. Parore made 42 and Twose hit 41 to 
help New Zealand make 244 for 8 and challenge Pakistan to have a go. 
Pakistan failed and New Zealand levelled the one-day series.
