-------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff Reporter
Explosions and heavy shooting rocked the city this week as 
unidentified men attacked the Gulshan-e-Iqbal police station from roof 
tops followed by a gunbattle on the 20th. Elsewhere in the city, 
targeted killings claimed ten lives, raising the month s death toll to 
98. Some instances worth mentioning are as follows.
KARACHI, Nov 16 A young man, whose mother was kidnapped and tortured 
to death in Orangi Town on Wednesday, was also found dead with several 
bullet injuries on Thursday.
On Wednesday, unidentified men kidnapped Najma from her Orangi 
residence at gunpoint. A couple of hours later her tortured corpse was 
abandoned in the same area. A day later residents found the bullet-
riddled body of son Asif Iqbal in the same area. He had been missing 
for the last two days.
A written note was found on his body, which said A gift from Kamal, 
Subhan and Jamal of MQM Haqiqi for MQM Altaf. Haqiqi leaders admitted 
that all the three whose names were mentioned in the note were their 
Orangi activists but said that why should a killer want to leave his 
trace.
A case has been registered against the MQM.
A 22-year-old man was shot dead in Malir City. The victim Fayaz had 
come just three days back from Mian Chunnoo in search of job. On 
Thursday he had left the house to meet some relatives but was found 
dead.
In another incidence according to the police Asim had come from 
Ancholi to meet his friend, Mohammad Kamran, in Block-9 in Dastagir. 
As they were standing at a paan shop, four persons, riding 
motorcycles, opened fire at them and disappeared.
Kamran died on the spot and Asim was injured. Their political 
affiliation could not be known.
Hakim Mubarak Rashid, was kidnapped and killed in Quaidabad. The 
killers set ablaze his shop also. The motive could not be known.
KARACHI, Nov 20 Heavy shooting rocked Gulshan area when youths who had 
taken positions atop the roof of a nearby building, attacked the 
Gulshan-i-Iqbal police station with rockets and home-made bombs. 
The rockets and bombs hit the outer boundary wall wounding a 
policeman. The attack was followed by a heavy gunbattle as police 
fired back, forcing the attackers to flee, leaving behind four anti-
tank rockets.
The entire police of district east was rushed to the affected area to 
tackle the terrorists. A number of residential buildings were under 
siege, and rangers and police carried out house-to-house search.
The police accused the MQM of carrying out the attack but said that 
the case would be registered sometime later.
Mohammad Akhtar Qureshi, 21, a shoe factory worker, was gunned down by 
unidentified assailants in Liaquatabad. The motive could not be known.
In Gulbahar, police found a body stuffed in a gunny bag lying in the 
boot of an abandoned car.
KARACHI, Nov 21 In Orangi Town, rangers picked up hundreds of men 
during the siege-and-search operation early in the morning. The wide-
scale arrests and house-to-house search in which the raiding parties 
allegedly misbehaved with women created tension in the area.
Heavy contingents of rangers and police surrounded parts of locality 
and picked up all the males even boys of 12 years of age were taken to 
nearby rangers headquarters.
MQM worker Khurshid Rehman, was gunned down in Gharibabad. Khurshid 
was sitting outside his house when he was sprayed with bullets.
Party chief Altaf Hussain sharply reacted to his murder, blamed the 
rival Haqiqi faction for the killing and warned the government against 
patronising the Haqiqis. He held the police, rangers, Intelligence 
Bureau and the Federal Investigation Agency responsible for Khurshid s 
murder.
Nizamuddin, was shot dead by unidentified men in Malir. Police claimed 
he was killed on the suspicion of being an informer.
KARACHI, Nov 22 An unidentified body stuffed in a gunnybag was found

of torture and bullets.

<a name="most"> Most wanted MQM man arrested</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov. 18 Saulat Mirza, 25, one of the most wanted MQM 
activists, was arrested by the rangers during a raid on Saturday 
morning. Official sources claimed that Saulat Mirza was the main MQM 
worker who masterminded terrorist activities in the city along with 
Naeem Sherri.
They described it as a third major victory for the government after 
Farooq Dada and Faheem Faruqui alias Commando and said the 
government s investment in informers was now paying dividend.
Farooq Dada had died in a mysterious encounter with his three other 
companions near the Quaid-i-Azam International Airport. Faheem and his 
two other companions, who were in judicial custody, were also murdered 
in a mysterious attack on a police party in Nazimabad. 
The forth man who was killed in the attack was later identified as a 
brother of Fahim. The wives of Farooq and Fahim are still in the 
custody of law enforcement agencies.
The MQM claimed that Saulat was arrested on information by another MQM 
worker, Faisal, who was arrested on Friday and was subjected to 
torture.
A few days back, Saulat s sister Nighat Zafar was also arrested and 
subjected to torture, the party claimed.
MQM chief Altaf Hussain urged the President to help save the life of 
Saulat who, he feared, would be tortured to death by the rangers.
He warned that if Saulat died of torture or was killed in any bogus 
encounter , the president would be held responsible for it.

<a name="alta">Altaf seeks lawyers help for workers release</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov. 22 The MQM chief, Altaf Hussain, has urged the lawyers 
to provide voluntary legal help to MQM workers and supporters and 
their families and save them from state atrocities .
Mr Hussain paid rich tributes to MQM Legal Aid Committee and its 
members for the job they have been rendering for MQM supporters. I 
need your (lawyers) help. Not for myself or my family, but for those 
helpless people who have been the victim of worst state oppression, 
he said.
Mr Hussain said the government had launched an operation against the 
MQM and its supporters to crush them, but despite the passage of 
over three-and-a-half years, it could not damage the MQM.
He said although the people thrice voted for the MQM, the government 
was not ready to recognise the representative position of the party. 
 The atrocities being committed against the MQM shows that we are not 
living in 20th Century but in the dark ages.
 Pakistan is passing through a most critical phase in its history. The 
situation demands that the government solves the political problems 
through political means. Instead, a crackdown has been launched 
against the party in vengeance, he said.
He asked the government to learn a lesson from the fate of past rulers 
who were involved in atrocities against the people.

<a name="atte">Attempt on Nawaz s life</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov 20 PML leaders have claimed that the attempt for a head-
on collision between a truck and the Pajero in which Leader of the 
opposition Mohammad Nawaz Sharif was travelling was not a an isolated 
incident, rather it was a calculated move to eliminate the PML 
leadership .
Speaking at a party workers meeting at Sindhi Muslim Society, PML 
Joint Secretary Jamshed Ahmed Khan said after the inhuman treatment 
mented out to Shahbaz Sharif, the fascists government can go to any 
extent against Nawaz Sharif, He asked the party workers to offer 
thanksgiving prayers for the safety of the life of their leader.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<a name="shah">Shahbaz shifted to Adiala jail</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 17 The leader of opposition in Punjab Assembly, Mian 
Shahbaz Sharif, was shifted by the FIA to Adiala jail on Friday, a 
day before expiry of his physical remand.
Pakistan Muslim League alleged that Mian Shahbaz Sharif was beaten by 
a assistant director of FIA before shifting him to the Adiala Jail. 
However, the political circles were intrigued over the shifting of Mr 
Sharif to the jail.
Secretary General PML Sartaj Aziz strongly condemned the physical 
torture of Shahbaz Sharif and termed it as a worst example of 
barbarianism of the present government.
In a democratic society subjecting opposition leader to physical 
torture cannot be think off, he said. The present rulers should 
remember that the nation would hold them accountable to the corruption 
and torture of their leaders.
Deputy opposition leader in National Assembly Gohar Ayub Khan said 
that the incident reflect the desperation of the rulers who had driven 
mad in political victimisation of their opponent.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
<a href="#oppo">Opposition s offer to save system, says Sartaj</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

LAHORE, Nov. 18 PML Secretary-General Sartaj Aziz sees no 
contradiction in the opposition s demand for national reconciliation 
and mid-term elections. He says the offer for national reconciliation, 
coupled with mid-term polls, is intended to save the system and not 
to bail out the PPP government .
Mr Sartaj Aziz alleged that Ms Bhutto had set preconditions for a one-
to-one meeting with Mr Sharif. Mr Aziz also asserted that, as Mr 
Sharif s finance minister, he had negotiated between terms with the 
IMF and the World Bank, but the PML government was then dismissed and 
caretaker premier Moeen Qureshi had accepted less favourable 
conditions.
Mr Aziz said Mr Qureshi had agreed to a budget deficit target of four 
per cent of the GDP (against the five per cent negotiated by Mr Aziz) 
and a reduction in maximum tariff to 35 per cent (against 50 per cent 
by Mr Aziz) during a visit to Washington in August 1993.

<a name="shou">Opposition should jointly work out line of action Nawaz</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Bureau Report
LAHORE, Nov. 18 Opposition leader Mian Nawaz Sharif on Saturday asked 
other parties in the opposition to sit together to evolve a national 
consensus on important issues facing the country and work out a line 
of action against the government.
He said the people in general and the people of Punjab in particular 
should rise as time was fast running out. It s a now- or- never 
situation , he added.
Referring to the maltreatment being meted out to opposition leaders, 
Mr Sharif said such conduct was unheard of in a democratic government 
or even in a martial law period.
About the sedition case registered against him, Mr Sharif said if he 
could be assumed to have done such a thing, the people whose 
forefathers had worked for the creation of Pakistan could also be 
labelled as traitors.
Condemning the alleged torturing of Mian Shahbaz Sharif, the PDP 
leader said the opposition should not sit idle. In case the opposition 
kept silent even on this issue and did not try to resist oppression, 
nobody would be secure in the future. He said all political leaders 
should sit together to map out a strategy to resist moves to impose 
what he called dictatorship or one-party rule.
He said his party would support any step taken to stop violation of 
women s rights, torturing of political workers, and to protest against 
corruption and the price hike. The PDP would be ahead of all other 
parties if the people came out on roads, Arshad Chaudhry said.
HRCP chairperson Asma Jehangir said the government should not 
victimise the opposition as the latter had its own status in the 
political system.
She was of the view that when a government used police to victimise 
its opponents, it was unable to take the police to task for any 
illegal action committed by them.
PML(J) leader Senator Tariq Chaudhry said the feudals, ruling the 
country, were responsible for all problems and they regarded people as 
their tenants. He underlined the need for collective efforts to get 
rid of the rulers.

Staff Correspondent
SIALKOT, Nov. 19 Opposition leader Mian Nawaz Sharif has alleged that 
the present government s ill-advised foreign policy was a big threat 
to the security, solidarity and integrity of the country and were 
pushing the country towards economic disaster.
He said he had started his march to oust this government and hoped 
that the nation would support him in his struggle. He said he had no 
personal motive behind the drive to oust the Benazir government.
He claimed that during his tenure he had wanted to evolve a system of 
government that the country would have become a paradise on earth for 
people of every class.

<a name="crit">Opposition criticised for attack on courts</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19 The minister for law and justice N.D.Khan 
criticised the opposition for trying to disrupt the democratic system 
in the country.
He said the opposition was stopping the MQM from continuing the 
dialogue with the government only because it wants to dislodge the 
government and establish Nawaz Sharif s government.
The minister while denying the allegations of manhandling of Shahbaz 
Sharif criticised the opposition for its attitude against the 
judiciary. He denied that there was any truth in the matter.
He said for the first time in the history of the subcontinent the 
institution of judiciary was ransacked under a planned conspiracy.

<a name="mech">Mechanism for justice, fairplay in 90 days if voted to power</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Bureau Report
PESHAWAR, Nov. 20 Leader of the Opposition Mian Nawaz Sharif pledged 
here Monday that on returning to power he will set up a mechanism 
within 60 days, which will ensure merit, fairness and justice for 
everyone. Corruption will also be routed out from the society, he 
added.
The economic situation is so vulnerable, he said, that the World Bank 
and economic experts are predicting that the country may become 
bankrupt by the end of the current fiscal when the deficit now at 50 
billion would be running into one hundred billion rupees.
Criticising the PPP leadership for failing to give the country 
economic stability and the people security of life and honour, Nawaz 
Sharif claimed the people were frustrated and disappointed by the PPP 
government.
Nawaz Sharif claimed that people were looking towards him with great 
expectations and he can only pull out the country from the current 
crisis and put it back on right tracks.
Nawaz Sharif claimed that the PPP rulers have accumulated large 
fortunes and even a palace-like house had been purchased in France by 
Asif Zardari as they do not see any future in Pakistan.
The people of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif said, were looking towards him 
for a call to rise against this corrupt and inefficient government, 
but he was waiting for a more suitable time. 
The PML president reiterated his challenge that he would retire from 
politics if a single case of corruption was proved against him. On the 
other hand, he said, the president of the country was involved in 
bank scam.
He said Benazir Bhutto must understand that she would have to leave 
power one day, and she must subject others to excesses to an extent 
which she herself can endure.

<a name="bena">Benazir taking revenge on nation Nawaz</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Staff Correspondent
HANGU, Nov. 21 Leader of the opposition Mian Mohammad Nawaz Sharif 
has accused Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of taking revenge from the 
nation for the execution of her father, by promoting corruption, price 
hike, denial of justice and political victimisation in the country.
Addressing a public meeting at Hangu on Tuesday, he accused the prime 
minister s spouse of large-scale plunder, alleging that Ms Bhutto had 
given him a free hand in financial matters.
He claimed that Muslim League would soon return to power and would 
weed out corruption, horse trading, price hike and rid the country of 
heavy borrowings. He vowed to continue the struggle to liberate this 
country from the Bhutto clique and restore law and order in the 
society.
He said that Benazir Bhutto s wrong policies have caused a great harm 
to the country s foreign relations and today friendly nations of 
Pakistan were opting for India in many matters.
Criticising the policies of the government, he added the people have 
become frustrated and were ready to launch anti- government campaign.

<a name="14ki">14 killed as bombs rip Egyptian embassy</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Nasir Malick
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19 At least 14 persons were killed and 59 wounded 
when a suicide bomber, apparently belonging to a militant Islamic 
organisation of Egypt, crashed his vehicle through the gate of the 
Egyptian embassy on Sunday morning here, security and hospital sources 
said.
Police believe the suicide bomber, driving a black vehicle, first 
threw a hand-grenade or some other explosive material to break open 
the main gate and after entering the embassy exploded another device 
which resulted in death and destruction.
The dead include six Egyptians, one Afghan and seven Pakistanis, who 
were either members of the staff or had gone there for seeking visas. 
The dead Egyptians include visa counsellor Hasham Abu Wafa.
Human flesh and limbs were scattered all around the embassy building 
when the reporters reached there. The rescue workers were seen 
collecting the limbs and pools of blood were seen everywhere.
The ambulances of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) and 
Federal Government Services Hospital failed to cope with the situation 
and Edhi Centre was asked to send its ambulances.
Security officials believe that a man in a black vehicle had first 
thrown some explosive to break open the embassy s main gate and then 
drove his vehicle inside. He perhaps wanted to crash his vehicle in 
to the building but did not succeed, one official said. In that case 
there would have been much more casualties. 
The Egyptian ambassador later told foreign minister Sardar Assef Ali 
and Najmuddin Sheikh that he was sitting in his office when the first 
blast took place. I immediately rushed towards the back stairs of my 
office towards my residence and then the second explosion took place 
bringing down the roof of the building, he said. My second in 
command who was in my room and had rushed to the front door died. 
Several cars parked in the embassy compound were twisted and their 
parts were found as far as 250 metres away from the building.
The facade of the embassy building, the visa section and the guard 
room have been completely destroyed. However, the residential area 
inside the building was safe structurally. The sprawling compound of 
the embassy was littered with twisted metal, blood and flesh.
The explosion caused widespread damage in the locality and shattered 
windowpanes of buildings as far as two miles. The nearby British 
diplomats colony, the ANZ Grindlays Bank, the United Nations 
Development Programme and IBM offices were the worst affected.
Many employees of ANZ and IBM received injuries and had to be rushed 
to the hospital. The bank suspended its operations.
Ambulances shifted the wounded to two most important hospitals of the 
Capital which lack the capacity to cope with such an emergency.
The Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, the biggest hospital of 
the country could take 26 seriously injured and received five bodies.
A doctor attending the emergency said two of the injured died because 
they could not be provided emergency medical help. We don t have 
space to accommodate so many people, you can see for yourself though 
we are told that we are working for the country s biggest hospital. 
The attack on the Egyptian embassy by militants has created panic in 
the Federal Capital, till now considered a fort and exposed the 
inefficiency of the concerned authorities.

<a name="baba">Babar accepts responsibility for security lapse</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19 Accepting responsibility for lapse of security 
arrangements in Islamabad, interior minister Naseerullah Babar said 
the report of the inquiry into the bomb blast at the Egyptian embassy 
would be placed before the house.
He said such suicidal attempts are always successful anywhere in the 
world. However, the killing or injury to a single person is a matter 
of shame for the government. My head hangs in shame over the death of 
so many people. 
He said had the embassy informed us of any suspect persons we would 
have taken precautionary measures. We would have placed them in 
custody and taken necessary steps to avoid such an incident.

<a name="secu">Security steps to be tightened, says Leghari</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19 President Farooq Leghari has condemned bomb 
blasts in the Egyptian embassy and said the government would have to 
take additional security measures to stop recurrence of such 
incidents.
 We would now be checking more vigorously the acts of violence and 
terrorism and the instructions have just been issued to apprehend the 
culprits , he added.
Talking to newsmen at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences 
(PIMS), where he had gone to see those injured in the bomb blasts, 
that the government would tighten security measures to provide 
protection to the diplomatic community.
Answering a question, the President said the government would also 
like to know whether the incident occurred due to any security lapse. 
 But my impression is that it was a suicide mission , he observed.
The President termed the incident a tragic one and said he was shocked 
to know about the killing of so many innocent people. He said Egypt 
was a brotherly Islamic country and the killing of its people was a 
matter of great concern for Pakistan. He also talked to the concerned 
authorities present on the occasion and asked them to inform him 
urgently about the background of the blasts.
Mr. Leghari directed executive director of the PIMS, Dr. Mushtaq, to 
properly look after the injured people. He also said that the 
government would provide special plane to airlift the bodies to Cairo.
Assef shocked Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali said 
that he was deeply shocked and grieved over the tragedy at the 
Egyptian embassy situated in the diplomatic enclave here.
In a statement issued here on Sunday, the minister said I was deeply 
shocked and grieved by the tragedy at the embassy of the Arab Republic 
of Egypt in the diplomatic enclave. It has resulted in the loss of 
many valuable and innocent lives and serious and extensive damage to 
the embassy building. According to the details available so far it was 
a terrorist act apparently perpetrated by a suicide bomber who may 
have blasted his way through the gate and set off a high explosive 
device in a pick up van.
 A preliminary count indicates that 13 persons, including six Egyptian 
officials (two diplomats) and 8 Pakistanis, including visitors to the 
embassy, local employees and policemen died in the blast while at 
least another 35 person were injured. As for damage to the property, 
not only the embassy has been severely damaged but window panes of 
nearby buildings, including the foreign office and some foreign 
missions were shattered causing minor injuries.
 Police party and security agencies were rushed to the embassy 
immediately and started providing relief assistance to the injured who 
were evacuated to the Polyclinic and PIMS. Army bomb blast squad also 
reached the spot immediately. An investigation team has been 
constituted which has already begun its work. The minister of interior 
and several cabinet ministers and foreign office officials have 
visited the site and condoled with the ambassador and his staff.
 Foreign office officials have also visited the hospitals to enquire 
about the treatment being given to the injured. The Egyptian 
ambassador has been assured of full help by the civil administration 
and the foreign office in coping with the aftermath of the tragedy.
 The government of Pakistan condemns this act of terrorism. It has 
conveyed to the government of Egypt its deep regrets about the loss of 
life and property and has pledged that no effort would be spared to 
trace the perpetrators and bring them to justice.
 On behalf of the government, I also offer my condolences to the 
bereaved families of the innocent Pakistanis who have lost their lives 
in this dastardly attack. We shall do all we can to help them in this 
tragic situation .

myself would have been dead, he said.
Giving a graphic account of the gory incident, he said that he was 
sitting by the glass windows in his room which fortunately were open 
and hence saved from breaking. On hearing the noise, he rushed outside 
in the hallway and saw his ambassador looking absolutely lost. I 
stopped him from going back into his room and instead pulled him down 
towards the stairs. A minute later another blast brought down the roof 
of the first storey where the ambassador s office was located. 
Mr Mahboob says he then lost sight of Mr Galal, because he got buried 
in concrete of the collapsed building. God saved me as I lay under a 
wooden beam. I thought my end had come. Mr Mahboob, however, never 
lost control of his senses, and with his hands and nails removed the 
rubble around him. As he struggled to join the survivors outside in 
the garden, he passed many mangled bodies on the ground floor. I 
couldn t recognise them. 
Mrs Noman Galal was shopping at Aabpara I heard the blast there and 
wondered what had happened. When I returned home, I saw ambulances and 
police around our embassy. Someone told me about the bomb blast. I was 
worried sick about my husband, she told Dawn as she showed this 
correspondent around the shattered rooms of her residence. Look at my 
living room. It has been wrecked. Our bedroom upstairs has also been 
completely destroyed, she said, trying very hard to keep her hysteria 
down.
Mrs Galal had only recently refurbished the ambassador s residence, 
and both she and her husband were very proud of their home, considered 
to be one of the best diplomatic residences in Islamabad.
Ambassador Gallal, who refused to talk to the Press, appeared in total 
control of the situation as he went about supervising the rescue 
operation. He kept telling this correspondent stoically It is okay, 
it is okay. But he wanted the army to cordon off the area which was 
beginning to fill up with people.
Mr Galal, while talking to this correspondent about the massive 
tragedy which had just struck, was however unwilling to comment on 
the culprits responsible for such a heinous act. According to a 
highly-placed government source, the Egyptian Ambassador had written 
to the Interior Ministry last Thursday asking for added protection 
because they had received death threats. 
The IG Police, Asad Alavi, and top intelligence personnel went into a 
closed-door conference with Ambassador Galal at his residence. They 
not only looked grim but were tight-lipped as they escorted Interior 
Minister Naseerullah Babar to pay his personal condolences to the 
Egyptian Ambassador.
Death and ruin hung over the area. On the way to the ambassador s 
house, the correspondent saw parts of a human brain lying next to 
strewn rose petals.

ISLAMABAD, Nov 19 Five Egyptians, including second secretary Ahmed 
Nameer Khalid and visa counsellor Hasham Abu Wafa, among 13 killed in 
a huge bomb blast at the Egyptian embassy in the federal capital on 
Sunday.
The lists issued by both Federal Government Services Hospital and 
Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital placed the death toll 
at 13 and 49 injured. Doctors at the Capital Hospital said that they 
treated 10 victims who were brought there raising the total of injured 
at 59.
The death toll is expected to rise further as the rescue workers were 
still clearing the debris and some of injured at the hospital were 
said to be in a critical condition.
Hunar Gul and Naseer Ahmed were the two serious patients at the 
Federal Government Services Hospital. Hunar Gul was a bit stable but 
Naseer Ahmed had very thin chances, a hospital source said.
A Japanese diplomat, Mr Mot-o, and economic adviser of the embassy

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 20 An American expert in explosives is arriving here 
to join investigations into Sunday s bomb blasts at the Egyptian 
embassy, killing 15 people and wounding more than 50, Interior 
Minister Naseerullah Babar mentioned.
The offer to send the US expert was made by Washington to the interior 
minister on Monday morning. I have told him that we have no 
reservation and the US expert can join the committee constituted to 
carry out the investigation. 
The interior minister said a 15-member Egyptian delegation also 
arrived in Islamabad on Monday morning to investigate into the bomb 
blast. Some of them have come to accompany the bodies of Egyptian 
diplomats killed in Sunday s blast while the remaining will stay here 
to join the investigation committee. 
He said Pakistan was a victim of international terrorism. Many 
(militants) had come to Pakistan during the Afghan jehad against the 
Soviet Union and stayed back after the end of the war.
Naseerullah Babar said one of the reasons why Pakistan was targeted by 
the so-called Egyptian Islamic militants was that it had extradited 
eight to 10 Egyptians earlier this year who were wanted on criminal 
charges in their home countries.
 Pakistan has been picked up for this terrorist act because, firstly 
these terrorists wanted to express their anger with their own 
government and secondly they wanted to give a signal to Pakistan that 
this can also happen here (if Pakistan continues to extradite 
Egyptians). 
He said the Sunday s bomb blast was a suicide mission and believed 
that the first bomb was thrown by the terrorist to bring the people 
out of the building in order to cause maximum casualties.
The minister said Pakistan would have to face difficulties in its 
fight against national and international terrorism. The people should 
help the government efforts against this menace.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Bureau Report
ISLAMADAD, Nov. 21 Pakistan Muslim League has condemned the bombing 
on the Egyptian Embassy and termed it as an abject failure of the 
government in providing adequate security to a diplomatic mission in 
Islamabad.
 It is an inevitable outcome of the incompetence of the PPP security 
apparatus since it has not been doing duty of protecting diplomats and 
citizens, rather it is engaged only in hounding and harassing the 
opposition, said a PML spokeswoman on Tuesday.
This is the second such unfortunate instance in Pakistan within last 
six months, the first being in March 1995 when two American diplomats 
were killed in Karachi, and now the second incident of the Egyptian 
Embassy has taken place in the capital itself, she said.
At a time when the Egyptian embassy was being made a target of 
sabotage and terrorism, the entire police, FIA and intelligence 
apparatus of the PPP regime was busy in hounding opposition leaders.
The extent of insecurity and lawlessness is not confined to foreign 
diplomats posted in Pakistan as evident from the killings of the 
American and Egyptian diplomats, but the ordinary citizen of Islamabad 
is also not safe, she added.
The same day that the Egyptian Embassy was bombed, there was an 
exchange of gunfire in the busiest bazaar of Islamabad. The Bazaar in 
which one shopkeeper was killed and two people injured. And the very 
next day, following a police raid on the residence of PPP MNA Ilyas 
Jutt who was staying in the official flats meant for Parliamentarians 
and officials, there was a gunfire in a residential area resulting in 
killing of one police man and one criminal, Agha Naveed, wanted in 
more than 50 cases in Lahore, who had taken refuge in the residence of 
the PPP MNA.

probe into the allegation by the Pakistan Bar Council as demanded by 
its maker and hinted at initiating criminal proceedings for his

His campaign for enactment of a law against blasphemy was meant to 
prevent such incidents and to make the offence punishable in

<a name="imfs">IMF stand-by loan linked to fresh conditions</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Shaheen Sehbai
WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 Pakistan and the IMF appeared making progress on 
Saturday over a 250 million dollar stand-by loan seen by Islamabad as 
a stepping stone for restoring the country s shattered credibility 
with the world body.
 The IMF has handed over the draft of the Letter of Intent to the 
Pakistani team, and it could be initialled as early as Saturday 
afternoon or latest by Monday, if Pakistan accepts the new IMF 
conditions, an informed source told Dawn. 
According to one insider the IMF had also objected to the launching of 
the Rs 25,000 prize bond by the government because it was likely to 
further depress the Stock Exchange as money was already being pulled 
out of the stock market and pumped into the scheme.
Pakistan considers the IMF stand-by loan as crucial to its 
international credibility and rating because Islamabad is on the verge 
of launching the two billion dollar Ghazi Barotha Dam project for 
which more than half of the money has to come from international money 
lenders like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and others.
All these institutions would be looking upto the IMF to give the green 
signal for lending almost a billion dollars to Pakistan in the next 
three to five years, and the IMF would like to ensure that the 
Pakistani economy was resilient enough to generate repayments for 
these loans.
Some experts here believe the Bhutto Government could accept any IMF 
conditions now to get the financing for the Ghazi Barotha project in 
place, and once this crucial time was over, it could then reconsider 
its priorities at the time of the next budget.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 Talks between the IMF and a Pakistani delegation 
for a 250 million dollar stand-by loan entered a crucial stage on 
Monday, but both sides maintained a discreet silence over the 
progress.
Observers, monitoring the talks, said the very fact that an adviser of 
Mr Jafarey s standing had to refer the conditions for prime minister s 
approval was an indication that he was not in a position to say yes 
instantly.
 The IMF has always been insisting on increasing government revenues 
and cutting down the budget deficit and this time they may be asking 
for a definite time frame for what steps had to be taken and when, 
one observer said.
These steps might involve politically difficult decisions and might 
further increase the cost of living, including the energy, gas and 
petroleum rates, besides imposition of more taxes, they said.
Pakistan is seeking the stand-by loan to send a message across the 
financial world that the IMF had restored its status as a dependable 
country and this would enable Islamabad to raise about one billion 
dollars for the Ghazi Barotha Dam Project, now ready for international 
financing.

Shaheen Sehbai
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 The IMF will provide 600 million dollars to 
Pakistan under a 15-month stand-by arrangement announced after seven 
days of hectic negotiations.
 This will serve as a stepping stone towards a new multi-year Extended 
Structural Adjustment Facility arrangement in 1996-97. Pakistan will 
get an up-front amount of 200 million dollars while the rest of the 
400 million dollars would be disbursed in two equal portions, prime 
minister s adviser V.A. Jafarey told a news conference.
Mr Jafarey said the new arrangement would be approved by the Board of 
the IMF in the third week of December. The ESAF arrangement would be 
restored sometime next year, he said.
Asked what new conditions the IMF had introduced for the 600 million 
dollar loan, Mr Jafarey said that until the IMF Board approved the 
loan, he could not talk about these conditions.
But, he said, the IMF had considered as adequate the devaluation of 
the rupee by seven per cent. No more devaluation has been asked by 
the IMF for the new loan. The adviser, however, said structural 
adjustments will have to be made next year when the ESAF is restored. 
To a question whether the current reserves included the two billion 
dollars of private dollar deposits, Mr Jafarey hesitatingly said 
 Yes. 
To a question whether the 600 million dollar loan was a surprise, as 
lower figure were being discussed earlier, he said Pakistan had 
received 52 per cent, of its IMF quota whereas other countries usually 
got up to 37 per cent of their quotas in stand-by facilities.

<a name="econ">Pakistan economic crisis lingers</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aslam Shaikh
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 22 Tuesday s understanding with the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF) for a stand-by loan of $ 600 million has been 
received with some relief here. Nonetheless it is not the end of the 
matter. At best it represents a partial reconciliation with the IMF 
because Pakistan has once again to go through the tortuous process of 
negotiating a fresh Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) to 
back up its reform programme during the next financial year.
The IMF has apparently not agreed to restore forthwith the last 
elaborately-negotiated accord which was suspended in the wake of our 
budgets failure to contain the overall budgetary deficit within the 
limits prescribed in that arrangement. Pakistan s reluctance to lower 
the external tariff in one go the ceiling suggested by international 
donors for easy access to Pakistan s market was also an important 
factor leading to the IMF penalty.
Under the circumstances there was no other alternative but to seek a 
stand-by loan linked with our own quota and which the IMF could not 
turn down because of certain privileges enjoyed by member state. 
However, unlike ESAF given on concessional interest the stand-by 
facility covers only one to two years and loaned on market-related 
interest rate. It also adds to a country s debt servicing 
difficulties, though not as much as a routine commercial credit.
The stand-by arrangement with the IMF now buys some time for Pakistan. 
While the financial emergency stemming from IMF s earlier penalty is 
over, Pakistan s economic crisis lingers requiring drastic measures to 
overcome the resource crunch in order to eliminate frequent recourse 
to external help. In the immediate context the partial reconciliation 
with the IMF may enable Pakistan to proceed with the projects for 
which financing has already been arranged, but the long-term scenario 
compels a serious and sober reappraisal of our mounting non-
development expenditure.

<a name="yaqu">Yaqub rules out any further devaluation</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ISLAMABAD, Nov. 16 Governor State Bank of Pakistan Dr Mohammad Yaqub 
said the Government would not readjust the value of rupee in the near 
future, because it intends to pursue tight fiscal and monetary 
policies.
In an interview, he said, the rupee was not devalued under any 
external pressure, adding it was the only solution to enhance the 
country s falling exports.
He said some 25 years ago the global economies followed fixed exchange 
rate system, and if a country devalued its currency its economy was 
considered as weak.
Although, now the floating exchange system persists nearly all over 
the world and the developed countries work on the basis of supply and 
demand of the currency. But Pakistan s economy is not strong enough to 
allow the market forces to determine the rates. We have a managed 
float system in which the State Bank of Pakistan determines how the 
currency should behave, he added.
But the basic requirement for creeping devaluation is that there 
should be no speculation in the market and nobody should get the clue. 
Unfortunately speculators read the indicators by noting that country s 
reserves were falling and also India had devalued its currency and 
hence Pakistan would follow suit, he added.
Speculators started to hoard dollars and in this environment the 
creeping devaluation cannot succeed, he said.

<a name="sele">Selective buying on many counters</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Nov. 20 Selective buying emerged strong on a number of 
counters on Monday, but the overall sentiment remained bearishly 
inclined owing to fresh selling on the overvalued shares.
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of 100-share tended further lower by 
17.39 point at 1,455.41 as compared to 1,472.80 a day earlier as base 
shares finished further shaded.
Analyst feel the next two weeks might be crucial for the direction of 
the market as investors will await some more positive developments on 
the peace front before opting for all-out buying to recoup in part 
losses spread over a year.
Performance of the PTC was well above the market expectations as an 
annual revenue of $1 billion for the year 1995 was a big figure judged 
by any standard, dealers said.
The early euphoria for the Rs 25,000 prize bonds is over and investors 
are back in the rings, although the funds are still be re-ploughed 
back in shares.
Some of the investment shares attracted good support at the lower 
levels under the lead of banks shares, notably Crescent, Bank of 
Punjab, International Bank, KASB & Co, MCB, Prudential Bank, and some 
others, finishing with modest recoveries.
Barring Asian Stocks and some others, mutual funds remained under 
pressure and so were modarabas, but leasing shares came in for stray 
support at the lower levels.
Dawood Leasing among them was the most active scrip after rumours of 
take-over and Al-Baraka group s active participation in its management 
affairs.
Adamjee Insurance remained under pressure and so did other leading 
insurance shares followed by the volatile textile sector which was 
again the victim of larger cotton sales totalling 2.5 million bales.
Synthetic, cement and energy shares were, however, actively traded but 
ended mostly with fresh setback. Most active among them managed to 
finish with good gains after early losses. PSO, and some others were 
leading among them, while Shell Pakistan, National Refinery, Honda-
Atlas and some others fell.
Among the MNCs which remained under pressure, Ciba-Geigy, Fauji 
Fertiliser, Rafhan, Maize, Pakistan Tobacco, Searle Pakistan, and some 
others.
Among the local blue chips, which fell heavily Dewan Textiles, and 
Shafiq Textiles were leading, falling sharply lower.
Parke-Davis was leading among the big gainers, rising to Rs 800, 
posting as average gain of Rs 40 in each session and as there was a 
shortage of a floating stock prices tended higher.
PTC led the list of most actives, off Rs 1.25 on 1.839 million shares 
followed by Hub-Power, easy 25 paisa on 16.07 million shares, Dhan 
Fibre, lower 40 paisa on 851,300 shares, Dewan Salman, off Rs 1.65 on
567,0000 shares, Dawood Leasing, up Rs 1.95 on 323,500 shares, Faysal 
Bank, easy 20 paisa on 252,500 shares, ICI Pakistan, off Rs 1.10 on 
141,900 shares, and Nadeem Textiles, up 25 paisa on 150,000 shares. 
There were several other notable deals also.
Trading was maintained at the overnight level of 9 million shares, 
while losers led gainers by 223 to 75 with 84 share loading on the 
last levels.

------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Nov. 21 Stocks took a breather from the protracted bearish 
spell on Tuesday as institutional traders moved in to cover positions 
at the lower levels.
The Karachi Stock Exchange index of share prices showed a fractional 
decline of 0.59 at 1,454.92 as compared to 1,455.51 a day earlier, 
reflecting the strength of base shares.
Barring 15 per cent cash dividend by Atlas Battery and Atlas Honda for 
the year ended June 30, 1995, the dividend news were disappointing as 
they took their toll in terms of price erosion in their respective 
counters.
The leading omissions were Genertech Pakistan, Regal Fibre, Plastobag, 
Shabbir Tiles, and Prince Glass, which surprised analysts.
Big gainers were again led by Parke-Davis, which showed a fresh good 
gain of Rs 20 at 820 on a turnover of 1,400 shares, which meant 
investors are taking profit.
It was followed by blue chips, notably Ghemini Leasing, 
PSO, Shell Pakistan, International Industries, and Engro Chemicals, 
which recovered by Rs 2 to 3.50. Other good gainers included Dadabhoy 
Insurance, Nagina Cotton, Mari Gas, S.G.Power, and Elite Publishers.
Prominent losers were led by Lever Brothers, ICI Pakistan Dawood 
Leasing, Pilcorp, Glaxo Lab, and Nestle Pakistan, falling by Rs 2 to 
5.
The most active list was again topped by PTC vouchers, up 45 paisa on 
2.317 million shares, followed by Hub-Power higher 45 paisa on 2.784 
million shares, Dewan Salman, off one rupee on 790,000 shares, Dhan 
Fibre, steady five paisa on 305,800 shares, Ibrahim Fibre, higher 40 
paisa on 305,500 shares, Dawood Leasing, off Rs 2 on 241,000 shares, 
Faysal Bank, up 15 paisa on 237,500 shares, and Maple Leaf Cement, 
higher 75 paisa on 140,800 shares. There were some other notable deals 
also.
Trading volume rose to 11.056 million shares from the previous 9.506 
million shares owing to active covering purchases in the current 
favourites.
There were 359 actives, out of which 100 shares rose, 197 fell, with 
62 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="stoc">Stocks falls massively on hasty selling</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Commerce Reporter
KARACHI, Nov. 22 Stocks fell massively on hasty selling spurred by 
rumours of an imminent second devaluation of the rupee by three per 
cent, pushing the KSE 100-share index down by about 35 points.
The index seemed to be set to breach the 1,400-point resistance level 
whether the year-end buying re-emerges or not at the fag-end of 
December. It has already lost well over 50 points during the week.
Analysts said news that the forex reserves have fallen below the 
psychological barrier of $1 billion on Wednesday worried investors as 
it reflected the economy is in a bad shape and exports are not picking 
up despite 10 per cent devaluation of the rupee some weeks back.
Most of the MNCs and indexed shares led the market retreat, falling 
sharply under the lead of Lever Brothers, ICI Pakistan including its 
right shares, Brooke Bond, Engro Chemicals and Honda-Atlas, falling by 
Rs 2 to 20.
The recent upward drive in Parke-Davis was also halted as after the 
post interim dividend sustained rise of well over Rs 450, it reacted 
by Rs 10.
Among the local blue chips, which fell sharply Dawood Leasing after 
news of the failure of take-over bid by Al-Baraka, Ghemini Leasing, 
KASB & Co, Dadabhoy insurance, Dewan Salman, Zeal-Pak Cement and 
D.G.Khan Cement.
Some of the leading shares managed to put on good gains under the lead 
of Grays of Cambridge, Sandoz Pakistan and International Industries.
Dividend news from Javedan Cement, and Wah Noble Chemicals were 
encouraging and should have evoked good interest in a normal trading 
sessions but were overshadowed owing to general decline.
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, off 55 paisa on 2.100 
million shares, followed by PTC vouchers, easy 30 paisa on 2.025 
million shares, Dewan Salman, down Rs 2.90 on 1.219 million shares,

Genertech Pakistan, unchanged on 144,000 shares and Ibrahim Fibre, off 
90 paisa on 111,000 shares.
Trading volume fell to 9.422 million shares from the overnight 11.056 
million shares owing to the absence of leading buyers.
There were 337 actives, out of which 227 shares fell, while only 37 
rose, with 73 holding on to the last levels.

<a name="kepz">KEPZ unit facing difficulty due to regulatory duty</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Aamir Shafaat Khan
KARACHI, Nov. 20 Activities at the Karachi Export Processing Zone 
(KEPZ), comprising 84 small and medium-sized industrial units, may 
come to a virtual halt in near future following government s decision 
to levy 5 per cent regulatory duty on all imports at the KEPZ.
The industrialists, with an estimated investment of $ 77.97 million, 
are in a state of virtual panic for a possible standstill of their 
operation and exports to foreign countries in case the government 
remains firm on its stand to maintain the decision.
A number of investors, who were planning to make investment for 
expansion of their existing units or setting up new projects, are now 
giving a fresh look at their plans after studying the financial 
implications of the 5 per cent regulatory duty.
At present the industrial units are dependent on the pile up 
inventories of imported raw material lying in their godowns that may 
wipe out within two or three days.
The industrialists have also not cleared their imported shipment of 
raw material lying at the Customs/Ports since the government has 
imposed this decision. They fear that the recent imposition of duty 
will not prove feasible to run the units resulting in a colossal 
losses and possible closure.
In a bid to apprise the government about the effects of the decision, 
a five-member investors team headed by the President of Chamber of 
Investors at the KEPZ, Mr Jamil Akhtar has flown to Islamabad on 
Monday to meet Secretary Finance Mr Javed Talat within two or three 
days. This team includes three foreign investors who are Mr Vandorne, 
Mr Tibor and Mr Hiran. Two members of the Managing Committee of the 
Chamber Mr Siddique Umar and Mr Ali Ahmad are also members of the 
team.
Mr Ali Ahmad disclosed that the ambassadors of Netherlands, Belgium 
and Canada are also expected to meet the senior officials including 
the Finance Secretary and the Secretary of Board of Investment to 
plead the case of the investors of their respective countries on the 
issue of levy of 5 per cent regulatory duty.
Mr Ali Ahmed said that exports from KEPZ amounts to $ 55 to $ 60 
million per annum while the export figures from a single unit ranges 
>from  $ 6 to $ 10 million per annum.
 In case the decision to levy 5 per cent regulatory duty on imports 
for the KEPZ units is not reversed, the investors might have no choice 
but close them down which could render 8,000 to 10,000 employees of 
the Zone jobless , Mr Ali Ahmad warned.
He said prior to this decision all exports from the KEPZ were 
subjected to one per cent development surcharge.
He said the Conference, despite rules of EPZA that no change would be 
made in the incentive package which may pull eye brow of investors, 
had taken an untimely decision when the investment in the Zone from 
foreign countries was in a take off position.
Meanwhile, President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Haji 
Shafiqur Rehman, in a statement, expressed his surprise over 
government s decision and argued that the EPZA had enjoyed complete 
tax exemption all over the world.
He said the recent decision was a violation of agreement with the 
foreign investors and added there was no provision of duty drawback 
for the zones-based exporters.
He opined that the decision would undermine the efforts that are being 
made to attract the foreign investors and urged the government to 
immediately issue the clarification to avoid the confusion.

<a name="trad">Traders in state of shock over postponement of PSI issues talks</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana
KARACHI, Nov. 21 The postponement of the scheduled meeting by the 
minister for commerce with the Pre-Shipment Inspection (PSI), 
companies on Tuesday, to discuss thorny issues of excessive valuation 
of imported goods and transparency of the system left trade and 
industry in a state of disarray.
He said that the business community in general, and the importers in 
particular, had been facing a lot of hardships since the introduction 
of Pre-Shipment Inspection scheme by the government.
The trade sources said that when the scheme was introduced, the 
problems that were confronted by the importers were considered as the 
teething problems, arising from inexperience of the staff of the two 
PSI companies, but there was no let up and the problems have 
multiplied manifold.
Even today the liaison offices of PSI companies are still not 
adequately manned to satisfy the importers because petty, clerical and 
typing mistakes are not rectified immediately, as they have no powers 
to do so, without referring to their foreign affiliates, importers 
lamented.
A leading importers said, the crux of the problem is that the pre-
inspection companies are invariably doing excessive valuation of 
imported goods and their method is not transparent and they are also, 
not satisfying the importers about their valuation. 
 These companies generally refuse to give documentary evidence or 
other legal basis in support of the CRF values, although under the law 
they are required to give evidence, he added.
It is felt that most of the valuation disputes arise as PSI companies 
give the value in CRF on the basis of prices prevalent on the date of 
inspection, while for customs purposes the value prevalent on the date 
of filing of Bill of Entry is required.
As a result even the values given in CRF are not accepted by the 
Customs and they arbitrarily assess value of the imported goods. It is 
also being said that in addition to this, the customs have also 
started issuing Valuation Advice which has complicated the problem.
The trade sources further alleged that the Working Committee 
constituted under SRO 1108(I)/94, to resolve the specific disputes was 
functioning without any rules and regulations with the result that the 
disputes remain unresolved, causing delays and financial losses to 
concerned importers.
Besides, these sources said, there was no provision of compensation to 
the importers in case they suffer losses due to delays in examination 
or issuance of CRF for which inspection firms are responsible.
There is a general complaint that the PSI companies are inflating the 
prices simply to justify their existence. They are enhancing the value 
of even those goods which are being imported under concessionary 
notifications, exhorted a leading importer.
All these problems are adding to the cost of production of the local 
industries, making their products uncompetitive in the international 
market, said an industrialist.
The trade and industry apprehended that if the problem of excessive 
valuation and its transparency are not resolved urgently and the 
system is not streamlined, it will induce and encourage smuggling to 
such an extent that both the legal imports and local industries will 
be badly hurt.

<a name="5%re">5% regulatory duty on imports from EPZ withdrawn</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Staff Reporter
KARACHI, Nov. 22 The government on Wednesday decided in principle to 
withdraw the 5 per cent regulatory duty on imports of raw material 
from  the Export Processing Zone (EPZ).
A spokesman of Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) Mr. Talat, told 
Dawn on Wednesday that the meeting also reached an undertaking to the 
effect that consignment of imported raw material lying in customs/port 
would be released without any duty.
He went on to say that the importers should furnish an undertaking to 
pay the regulatory duty and their goods should be allowed clearance by 
the Customs. Mr.Talat also mentioned that necessary steps would be 
taken by the CBR to issue the required SRO in this regard.
The spokesman said that CBR s previous decision to impose 5 per cent 
regulatory duty was hard to swallow as the EPZs had been declared 
foreign territory for the purpose of imports and a separate country 
code had been allocated to the Zone by the State Bank and Customs.

<a name="unna">Unnar</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ardeshir Cowasjee
SINCE I last wrote on Ghulam Hussain Unnar ( Fascism , Nov. 3) his 
fortunes have further faded. Most importantly, he has been deprived of 
another 14-day period of liberty, during which his health has 
deteriorated.
His remand in the 58th case registered against him having expired on 
November 8, he was remanded yet once more in police custody in the 
59th case.
The SHO Gulbahar Police Station reported to the magistrate It is 
submitted that on 20-1-93, unknown persons injured the case 
complainant (FIR 7/93) and his gunman and had snatched Rs 424,000 and 
one 7-MM Rifle. Today in theft case, accused Ghulam Hussain Unnar, s/o 
Mohammad Unnar, was arrested. Since investigation is to be completed 
and stolen property is to be recovered, it is therefore prayed that 
remand of the accused in police custody up to 21-11-95 may kindly be 
ordered. 
Magistrate s order Accused could not appear in the Court as he is 
admitted in the NICVD ward at Jinnah Hospital as indoor patient and 
unable to attend in court for report of RMO NICVD ward, as such I 
remand the accused to P.C. up to 21-11-95 for investigation of the 
case. Sd/- Judicial Magistrate, Court No. 1, 1st class Magistrate, 
Karachi Central, 8-11-95.
How did the SHO suddenly realise after a lapse of a thousand days that 
Unnar was one of the unknown persons ?
The most damaging retrogression in Unnar s predicament was evidenced 
in the Sindh High Court on that same November 8. His bail application 
in the sedition case filed against him by the government was rejected. 
This very sick man s application was vehemently opposed by the 
government s Assistant Advocate-General K.M. Nadeem, and the recently 
appointed Justices Ali Mohammed Baloch and Abdul Latif Qureshi could 
 not find cogent reasons to free Unnar on bail.
Nadeem relied heavily on case law relating to the refusal of bail to 
none other than Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak in the famous 1908 case, 
Tilak vs. Edward VII Rex Imperator. Tilak s application was pleaded by 
none less than Mohammed Ali Jinnah. If Barrister Jinnah could not bail 
out Tilak, how could it be expected of Unnar s Barrister, Azizullah 
Shaikh, to bail out Unnar?
Nadeem may perhaps not know the full Tilak story. In the summer of 
1908, Tilak was arrested and charged with seditious writings for 
several editorials published in his Poona newspaper, Kesari. Tilak 
represented himself before the Bombay High Court, but immediately 
after his arrest he was held without bail. He secured the services of 
Jinnah to plead for his release pending trial. But British justice had 
closed its mind on Tilak long before the trial began and Jinnah s 
valiant pleadings were of no avail. Jinnah s arguments may have fallen 
on deaf ears, but they attested not only to his brilliance as a 
barrister but to his national leadership potential. A lesser man could 
well have found some excuse and refused to plead on behalf of the 
leader of an opposing political party. Not Jinnah. He stood up for 
Tilak in 1908 and once again in 1916 when he defended him on another 
sedition charge and won, thus winning the gratitude and admiration of 
Hindu India s foremost conservative leader.
Now to Unnar the man. He hails from a family of Sindhi politicians, 
call them zamindars, waderas, rustlers, private jail owners, common 
thieves or what you will. His veins flow with the same blood as his 
fellow Sindhis the Bhuttos, the Jatois, the Junejos, the Khuhros, 
the Syeds, the Shahs, the whole jing-bang lot. Unnar, like the others, 
has been in and out of all our political beds, but his sin this time 
round was to fall out of the wrong side of the PPP bed.
They first got Unnar on 12 corruption cases and he was jailed. But he 
managed to get out on bail. They next tried Preventitive Detention 
Orders passed by the DC, Larkana, and the Sindh Home Secretary. These 
were challenged in the High Court but before they could be heard the 
detention periods expired. The Karachi police were then roped in to 
operate the blind FIR cycle. This clumsy system has so far worked 
well and efficiently, and Unnar has continually remained in police 
custody for almost two years, implicated, so far, in 59 cases.
Unnar s health is precarious. Born in 1949, in 1974 he had his first 
heart attack. In 1986 he had coronary by-pass surgery, and since then 
his heart problem has aggravated, and in view of the poor condition of 
his heart he can have no further by-passes. A heart transplant is the 
sole solution, for which he will have to go abroad. His medical 
problems as listed by Professors Azhar Faruqui and Sultan A. Shah, the 
medical board constituted by the government, are 
Advanced ischemic cardiomyopathy with ventricular arrythmias 
uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus Uremia Hyperlipidemia Hyperuricemia 
chronic ENT infection chronic acid-peptic disease chronic 
depression obesity.
Incarceration increases depression, decreases his general health, and 
reportedly his heart is now pumping at a 20 per cent efficiency.
A sample of the cases in which so far he has been implicated 
The 38th case, blind FIR 99/94 Unnar was arrested on 30.3.95 and 
remanded into custody for an offence committed on 28.12.94 on which 
day, he was in police custody, guarded by four policemen round the 
clock, at the NICVD.
The 39th case, blind FIR 95/94 Unnar was arrested on 11.4.95 and 
remanded in custody for an offence committed on 6.7.94 on which day, 
he was in police custody, guarded by four policemen round the clock, 
at the NICVD.
The 40th case, blind FIR 283/94 Unnar was arrested on 25.4.95 and 
remanded in custody for an offence committed on 21.7.94 on which day, 
he was in police custody, guarded by four policemen round the clock, 
at the NICVD.
The 42nd case blind FIR 219/94 Unnar was arrested on 11.5.95 and 
remanded in custody for an offence committed on 14.8.94 on which day, 
he was in police custody, guarded by four policemen round the clock, 
at the NICVD.
For a man to be held continuously in custody for almost two years, 
simply through the machinations of the SHOs of various police stations 
in Sindh, one must conclude that he has been subjected to a deliberate 
effort coordinated by hidden hands in the police stations, in Police 
Headquarters, in the Chief Minister s office. And, without the active 
connivance of some higher-up in Islamabad, these hidden hands could 
not act. By whom are they being controlled?
On December 21, 1994, after having been implicated in 29 cases and 
having remained continuously in police custody since March 22, 1994, 
Unnar appealed to the President, to some other heads of state and to 
their ambassadors, to human rights bodies, etc., as a result of which 
the state seemingly retorted, we have every right to beat you but how 
dare you cry , and punished him by filing a case of sedition against 
him.
The point arises as to whose actions were responsible for bringing 
into hatred and contempt the federal or provincial government 
 established by law , and who was to be punished for these actions? 
Was it the police and the state, or was it Unnar?
In a case such as Unnar s, is it possible for the Chief Justice, in 
the exercise of the Supreme Court s human rights jurisdiction, to take 
suo moto cognisance of the exercise of police power or the power to 
arrest under the above facts and circumstances, specifically with a 
view to determining whether or not any illegality or crime has been 
committed by the official agencies?
Unnar s bail application having been rejected by the High Court, 
Azizullah is now filing an appeal in the Supreme Court, where it will 
probably be heard by My Lord, the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sajjad 
Ali Shah (an appeal against whose decision lies only with Our Lord in 
Heaven), who of necessity has to be and is a compassionate man.

<a name="asth">As the haemorrhage continues</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
M.B. Naqvi
KILLING of 15 people by unknown persons and six other violent deaths 
in a single day (Nov. 2) occasioned much horror. What made it worse 
was the sickening exchange of unsubstantiated charges between the 
government and the MQM each accused the other of masterminding the 
ghastly massacre.
Adequate evidence is lacking and the atmosphere has become highly 
charged by unending partisanship in blaming the other side. Today 
two camps have emerged throughout the country one keeps its gaze 
obsessively fixed on MQM terrorism and refuses to consider anything 
else until and unless it is condemned out of hand. They dismiss all 
other things, including the gross excesses of the security forces as 
secondary.
The second school, although it condemns terrorism, both per se and of 
the MQM, finds the conduct of the state apparatus reprehensible and 
far more to blame. They infer from known facts the number and 
circumstances of custodial deaths, the frequency and circumstances of 
police encounters and the arrests and treatment to young Mohajir boys 
after each siege and search operation and the way they obtain their 
release. All this has gone on for three and a half years in Karachi 
and other cities. State is perceived as having targeted a defined 
ethnic group all its members are being treated as suspects it is 
asserted the majority of the Mohajirs are anyhow MQM s voters and 
supporters.
But those who get surrounded in such operations and have to undergo 
the humiliating procedures of getting themselves and or their sons or 
nephews released after payment of backbreaking bribes regard the 
problem differently. For them the state, in the shape of its security 
services and agencies , is an unfriendly visitation that has nothing 
to do with them.
Most Urdu-speaking people, from vendors of vegetables to writers, 
focus mainly on the behaviour of the state. They more often than not 
fear the MQM s final success as much as they detest the conduct of the 
 agencies . But to them and to many other intellectuals and 
politicians of varied ethnic backgrounds, primacy belongs to state s 
behaviour. If it does not obey its own laws and gives its security 
forces a licence to kill suspects, its culpability overrides 
everything else, even heinous crime by individuals. If the state wants 
to remain acceptable at least as a civilised entity Authority in 
Karachi and the urban areas has to reverse its course urgently.
The point is that the latter school is quite as inflexible as PPP-
supporting intellectuals who think the widely-reported-but-largely- 
unproven MQM terrorism adequately justifies the state to adopt the 
measures it has. Meanwhile, the haemorrhage, human as well as 
political and economic, goes on and no one seems to be in control, 
because the government, at both federal and provincial levels, is now 
party to the dispute with MQM that people increasingly see as an 
ethnic and communal clash.
MQM supporters in all towns and cities of Sindh think that it is their 
communal existence the rights now subsume many things is at 
stake. But which is the other side? PPP- supporting intellectuals of 
ethnic Sindhi origin believe that the MQM is after dividing Sindh and 
means to take away something vital from old Sindhis. Since the PPP is 
valiantly resisting the MQM s bid, it is to be supported.
While it has to be admitted that such a Sindhi sentiment has now 
become a communal psychosis, the fact is that the Urdu-speaking 
intellectuals, by and large, want to preserve Sindh s unity. This 
correspondence of objectives between the two sets of intellectuals 
does provide a basis for preventing the PPP-MQM civil war from 
sparking off something worse. That should be the basis for a 
settlement even at this late stage of Sindh s complicated 
problems.
Two separate questions require immediate answers. Where precisely do 
the economic, social and political interests of old ethnic Sindhis and 
the post-1947 Mohajirs collide and whether such a clash is 
unavoidable? Secondly, how precisely did the government-MQM 
confrontation start and which interest of old Sindhis was involved? 
Insofar as anyone can see, except on one specific issue, there is 
simply no divergence of interests the two communities live on two 
planes one is dependent mainly on agriculture and is rural in 
orientation. The Mohajirs are mainly urban and as such have different 
interests and orientation. It is foolish of the MQM that while talking 
of Karachi, it does not mention others in the cities Punjabis, 
Pathans, Baloch and other naturalised immigrants as well as those 
Sindhis who have become urbanised. If it did, it will find a much more 
diversified support from other ethnic elements. Why does the MQM not 
see that they all have to deal with the same ugly face of the state 
that Mohajirs do treatment to others is only marginally better while 
precise civic problems are the same for all.
The one issue where the interests might clash is government jobs (and 
admissions to specialised colleges) both sides are hungry for them. 
If the basic interests of old and new Sindhis do not come in conflict, 
why all this communal feeling and inherent tension. It is a fit 
subject for investigative reporting.
Before considering the bases and chances of a political settlement in 
Sindh between the PPP and the MQM the authentic representatives of 
the two stable sections of the people of Sindh we must consider the 
second query. How did this confrontation get going. The MQM was a 
partner of Mian Nawaz Sharif at the Centre and Syed Muzaffar Ali Shah 
in Sindh when the Army operation later to be called Operation Clean-
up started. It is known that all political authorities, PM Sharif, 
CM S.M. Shah, even President G.I. Khan, were embarrassed and actually 
disapproved it. Regarding his motivations, the COAS Gen Assif Nawaz 
Janjua reportedly observed that if the PML can have three or four 
factions why the MQM cannot have two.
No settlement would be possible unless the army high command and Prime 
Minister Bhutto are convinced that dividing or destroying the MQM is 
really unnecessary. The situation in Karachi, Hyderabad and other 
towns of Sindh is grave. Apart from horrible violations of human 
rights, the state of mind among Mohajirs, particularly youth, is in a 
dangerous flux.
One has earlier written that the extent of alienation especially 
whether it is still reversible may be debatable. But the fact that 
the process has started and gone some way does not require proof. No 
doubt the Mohajirs are small and containable community and might not 
be seen to pose a threat to Pakistan. But can we, the liberal 
democrats, countenance a whole section of Pakistan people certainly 
much bigger than the total Baloch population or about six per cent of 
all Pakistanis remain disaffected and unhappy. Should Authority 
write off the affections of six per cent or more of its population?
Bases of settlement are there and constitute almost a national 
consensus. Only the political will jointly in the GHQ and Federal 
Government is wanting for obscure reasons.

<a name="hast">Has the Chief Magistrate seen Becket?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Ayaz Amir
SEEN Becket, the film that is, is more appropriate in this context 
than to have read anything about him because as we all know reading is 
not one of the principal Pakistani habits.
Mr Zardari apart, for he must remain the learned exception in such 
cases, when was the last time the Daughter of the East read anything 
even remotely serious? Or for that matter the new leader of the 
people. Mian Nawaz Sharif? Till our circumstances change for the 
higher education of the Pakistani elite which is not in harmony with 
the culture and outlook of this class.
Becket, old film buffs will remember, was a crony of Henry the 
Second s. He used to go hunting with him. Moved by the thought that he 
could do no better than to have a friend and a loyalist as his chief 
confessor, King Henry made Becket Archbishop of Canterbury. What 
seemed like a smart move soon turned into a major headache when 
Becket, wearing the sacerdotal robes of his office, started nursing 
doubts about where his true loyalties lay to his friend the king or 
to the responsibilities of his high office. Differences between the 
King and the archbishop became so acute that Henry the Second, getting 
sentimental over his cups, asked his barons Will not one rid me of 
this troublesome priest? The barons duly obliged him by plunging 
their swords into Becket s back.
In Pakistan today the roles are slightly reversed. The king or rather 
the queen in this case is Benazir Bhutto. Playing the role of Becket 
is Farooq Leghari, elevated to the presidency because of his proven 
loyalty and, let it also be said, because he had the bearing and the 
intelligence which made him a suitable candidate for the highest 
office in the land. Far be it from me to suggest that President 
Leghari should court a fate similar to that of Becket s. I am not an 
ill-wisher of his and I am also aware that we do not live in an age of 
heroes. Even so, with the waters rising and dark clouds lining the 
national horizon, has not the time finally arrived for the Pakistani 
Becket to consider what should take precedence in his mind his 
loyalty to the Prime Minister, which he would be an ingrate not to 
feel, or his loyalty to the trust which he holds in his hands?
This question, which should be relevant at all times, acquires added 
urgency because of the grim mood that is settling over the country 
these days. The list of the nation s problems is long. Inflation for 
one is breaking the backs of even the middle classes. But more than 
specific problems what is darkening the national mood is the feeling 
that the present system has broken down or that it is not doing any 
good to the people that politicians, of whatever hue or persuasion, 
are rascals out to line their own pockets and that those in a 
position of authority are past caring for the public welfare or the 
future of the country. Inflation, joblessness, corruption, the 
extravagance of government and stories of kickbacks are just details 
in this larger mood of anguish and despair. Never have the people been 
more hopeless about where their country is headed.
Now what is the responsibility of a Becket in this situation? To swim 
with the tide as President Farooq Leghari is so strenuously doing or 
to do whatever lies in his power to stem it? Democracy must be 
preserved. Of that there should not be the slightest doubt because any 
alternative would be disastrous. But surely democracy should not mean 
allowing the present dangerous drift to continue.
The system of checks and balances devised unwittingly by General Zia-
ul-Haq but which still had a great deal of good in it has already 
broken down. The Prime Minister s office faces not the slightest check 
on the way it is mismanaging the country s affairs because the 
Presidency, paralysed by a mistaken sense of loyalty, has abdicated 
its constitutional function of keeping an eye on its activities. The 
most glaring symptom of what the nation faces as a consequence is the 
situation in Karachi which, if it invites parallels with anything, is 
the 1970 crisis in the then East Pakistan.
It is this same dangerous vacuum which is giving full vent to 
religious extremism which has even affected a section of the army as 
the recent abortive coup attempt vividly testifies. As I write these 
lines (on Sunday morning) the reverberations of a huge blast in the 
Egyptian embassy have shaken almost the whole of Islamabad. Isolated 
acts of terrorism a healthy nation can take in its stride. But when 
the body politic is infected with a larger sickness even isolated 
incidents are bound to be given an apocalyptic colour.
It must clearly be understood in this context that Pakistan is not a 
land of frenzied bigots. Its people have little sympathy for mediaeval 
theories about their salvation. But when the state becomes a vehicle 
of corruption and when as a consequence its ability to enforce its 
writ or give a minimally just dispensation to its citizens declines, 
other forces will step in to fill the vacuum. That is what is 
happening in Pakistan today . With the people losing faith in their 
established leaders and with democracy itself getting a bad name they 
are becoming susceptible to the siren calls of extremism. Even though 
this is a nation of armchair revolutionaries, more and more people can 
be heard advocating the merits of a drastic national surgery.
That such thinking is dangerous should scarcely be a matter of any 
doubt. The Iranian revolution has run out of steam and no longer holds 
a mirror of attraction to other Muslim nations in the region. 
Afghanistan is an object lesson in the disaster that can befall a 
country when ethnic passions are married to blind fanaticism. Pakistan 
needs to go forward not backward in time. It is not a question of 
turning it into a liberal haven but into a society based upon 
justice and the rule of law. But this is not going to happen, in fact 
Pakistan will fall further into the clutches of narrow-minded 
extremism, if corruption and governmental incompetence are allowed to 
eat further into the vitals of the state.
The issue therefore is not of preserving or getting rid of the present 
government which while securing for itself a grip on the ephemera of 
power is giving the people a rich harvest of despair. The issue is one 
of restoring the people s faith in the present system and of rescuing 
the country from the malaise in which it is getting more stuck with 
each passing day. But from whence is this act of reformation going to 
come? Not from the Prime Minister s office which has dark blinds on 
its windows. Hopefully not from the army because any solution it 
imposes will be worse than the disease. That leaves the Presidency, 
the third leg of the tripod of power on which the present system 
rests. But the highest function of the Presidency seems to be in the 
glorification of the trivial and the absurd.
What then should the Presidency do to get out of its self-imposed 
terror? Certainly not send the government packing because we have had 
too many of these futile exercises in the past ten years. But without 
suggesting the impossible, it can certainly begin assuming the role of 
the stern schoolmaster, which is what its true role is in the present 
political set-up, so that the Prime Minister s office can be helped to 
focus on the three things that need immediately to be done clear up 
the mess in Karachi by bringing a modicum of vision to the solution of 
its problems rather than lambasting them with more and heavier doses 
of short-sightedness and partisanship by trying to douse the fires of 
inflation which are turning Pakistan into a Latin American country 
and by taking a sterner view of governmental corruption because more 
than anything else this is what is responsible for the alienation 
which is giving a sullen look to the Pakistani people.
This is not an impossible agenda but it will not be fulfilled if the 
President cannot rise above his circumstances or if he continues to 
identify his own fortunes with those of a government which, while 
outwardly secure, has done more than many others to stoke the embers 
of a deep frustration, if not an active discontent, across the land.

<a name="poli">Police excesses</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Editorial Column
THE Karachi police have been known for their corruption and 
highhandedness. As the city has slid into a state of anarchy and 
lawlessness- partly as a result of deep alienation and anger caused by 
police repression-they have responded by stepping up their excesses 
which have now surpassed all limits set by civil society. But that is 
not all. The police do not want their highhandedness to be exposed. 
Hence their hyper-sensitivity to media reporting-in words as well as 
pictorially-of their excesses and wrongdoings.
This attitude was amply demonstrated on Sunday when a senior press 
photographer, who also happens to be the president of the Pakistan 
Association of Press Photographers, was severely beaten up by the 
minions of the law. His only fault was that he was taking pictures of 
women who were protesting against the arrest and detention of their 
sons by the police.
This incident will be widely deplored on two counts. First, it shows 
the increasingly intolerant and aggressive attitude of the police and 
other law enforcement agencies towards the general public and their 
propensity to commit excesses in the name of law enforcement. 
Inevitably, there is a lot to hide and a false face to put on things.
In the process, all norms of responsible conduct are brushed aside and 
even journalists are often forcibly prevented from performing their 
professional duty. The treatment meted out to the photographer is 
characteristic of that pattern. On a number of occasions, journalists 
have also had to suffer ignominy at the hands of the law enforcers, if 
they have not actually found themselves in police lock-up. Because of 
its implications, this incident should be taken note of by the 
government. Since the police station where he was roughed up has been 
identified, it should not be too difficult for the authorities to 
identify the culprits and take appropriate action against them. A mild 
reprimand or transferring them elsewhere would amount to condoning 
their offence which calls for stern punishment.
If the government really stands for Press freedom this is the least it 
should do to establish the credibility of its claim. The second aspect 
of the matter is the issue which the photographer in question was 
trying to capture pictorially and which the authorities have been 
ignoring despite repeated calls from the media for some action. That 
is the highhandedness of the police in dealing with the law and order 
situation in Karachi.
Partly because it lacks scientific training in investigation and Crime 
detection, the police tend to be high-handed when trying to catch 
perpetrators of violence. Indiscriminate arrests, torture and search 
operations are commonly resorted to by the law enforcement agencies 
trying to nab some wanted persons. In conducting such man-hunts, 
little respect is shown for human rights and the dignity of men and 
women, which results in so much alienation of the people. The 
authorities failure to put the police and the other security agencies 
under restraint and to contain the brutality and excesses committed by 
them is making the situation in Karachi infinite worse and the 
prospects or a political settlement more remote.

<a name="wher">Where is Usman Khalid?</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Hafizur Rahman
THE question, Where is Usman Khalid? is asked by many people who 
admired the man as an upright soldier, a patriot in the true sense of 
the word and a courageous Pakistani who had the conscience and the 
guts to stand up to martial law. I fear, however, that, as things are 
going, the question may soon turn into, Who is Usman Khalid? 
That is the trouble with people in exile they are soon forgotten. I 
don t know about Usman Khalid s friends, but his former employer, the 
Pakistan Army, has certainly forgotten him except for its desire to 
try him for desertion. The President and the Prime Minister have not 
only forgotten him but also neglect him as a ticklish army problem. 
The awam, among whom he counted himself because of his political 
views, don t even know if he exists.
Usman Khalid was a brigadier in the army, on leave in London, when he 
put in his resignation (to the Ministry of Defence) in September 1979. 
He had been in a state of acute trauma ever since the hanging of Prime 
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto five months earlier. When he could take 
it no longer, he decided to give up his career in the army.
The resignation said, In conformity with the universal tradition... 
of senior officers resigning when they have fundamental disagreement 
with policy and practice, I resign in protest against the armed Forces 
being used as an instrument of subversion of the Constitution, 
terrorising the population, usurpation of political power, and 
politicking to disenfranchise the majority. 
Three brigadiers, Ashraf, Ishtiaq and Niazi of 10 Div, had earlier 
resigned in April 1977 because the army was then being used against 
the people in the PNA agitation to protest the general election of 
March 1977. Their resignations were accepted and they were retired 
honourably. But it seems that General Ziaul Haq wanted to make an 
example of Usman Khalid for his political views and he was proclaimed 
a deserter and twice sentenced to 14 years RI in his absence.
Since then, Usman Khalid is in exile, whatever adjective you may like 
to use with the word to categorise it. He has had heart bypass surgery 
 not a very successful one and can only think of coming back home, 
the pain of being arrested for desertion and facing a military trial. 
There is no other charge against him of indiscipline or misbehaviour 
or conduct unbecoming of an army officer.
It is interesting to note that Lord Averbury, Chairman of the 
(British) Parliamentary Human Rights Group, to whom Pakistan is 
beholden for positive support to the Kashmir cause, has written twice 
to the Prime Minister, and met her once, on the subject of Usman 
Khalid. She said it was for the army to forgive him or accept his 
resignation.
Lord Averbury s view (not a view to be taken lightly) was that, as 
head of government, the Prime Minister had the authority to take up 
any case. He submitted (poor man!) that if she signified her 
acceptance of the Brigadier s resignation, then the army might have a 
favourable view of the case. Obviously, his submission was not 
acceptable.
Last year Usman Khalid s son got married. He sent the PM an invitation 
card, but said, I know it would not be prudent for you to attend you 
cannot fraternise with a fugitive . He hoped all the same that she 
would send her ADC with some flowers, a gesture which would be highly 
appreciated. Maybe the ADC couldn t be spared from other duties.
Sixteen years in exile, living all the time in an alien atmosphere, 
yearning for home and friends and dear ones (and even for the army 
which he respects very much for I rose to be a brigadier, ) and not a 
hope in sight that he would see his country again as a free man. The 
basic reason is that no one is ready to help him, and the army thinks 
it must honour the decision of General Zia-ul-Haq.
Usman Khalid did not take the law into his own hands. His resignation 
hurt no one except himself and his family. He was a conscientious 
objector, a term accepted by all civilised nations, and not a 
deserter. Surely there must be a place in a democratic country for 
legitimate protest. Insistence on punishment for him amounts to 
accepting that the military coup of July 1977 was justified.
Britain has given Usman Khalid political asylum. Apart from Lord 
Averbury, other leaders of public opinion in that country must be 
wondering (in the context of his case) what has changed in Pakistan 
after the restoration of constitutional rule and an elected 
representative government, that a person who struggled for democracy 
cannot rid himself of persecution.
There is another aspect of the Brigadier s story. Every day we hear of 
people being named and extolled for having made great sacrifices for 
the cause of democracy. Those who went to jail even for a few days 
during martial law period are glorified as heroes. Among all of them 
who genuinely and unselfishly fought for the truth and what they 
thought was right, Usman Khalid s name is nowhere mentioned.
In view of the above, you will appreciate my answer to the question, 
 Where is Usman Khalid? The only answer I have is he is where he was 
sixteen years ago, and is likely to remain there unless someone s 
conscience wakes up.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="whip">Pakistan whip N.Z. to enter squash semis</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dicky Ratnagur
CAIRO, Nov. 16 Jansher Khan's return to the side after a days rest 
saw Pakistan safely negotiate their quarter-final in the World Team 
Squash Championship. They beat New Zealand, who were third in their 
group, 2-1. Pakistan's opponents in tomorrow's semi-final will be 
Australia who, with England are the only unbeaten side in the 
competition. 
Jansher, still in discomfort with blisters on his right foot, had to 
pull Pakistan back from a 0-1 deficit in ties because in the opening 
contest, Zarak Jahan Khan surprisingly lost to Glen Wilson, the World 
number 57, with a score of 9-7, 9-2, 9-10, 9-3. 
The New Zealander played exceedingly well, stroking the ball 
powerfully and with consistency, but Zarak had an extremely poor day 
and contributed largely to his collapse with a series of unforced 
errors, 
particularly in the second and fourth games. 
With his opponent hitting a bad patch in the middle of the first game, 
Zarak was well placed at 63. But a tinned forehand angle followed by 
two superb winners by Wilson narrowed the gap to 6-5.
Zarak increased his lead to 7-5, at which point there were two blank 
hands played. Then Wilson found the nick with a magnificent forehand 
shot played across court and Zarak conceded a penalty point to put 
Wilson level for the first time since 2-all. Zarak served once more at 
that stage but could not make headway.
Wilson gobbled up the second game in only six minutes, with Zarak 
hitting the tin no fewer than nine times. The New Zealander went from 
2-1 to 5-1 in one hand and also took the last four points in a row.
Two errors by Wilson at the start of the third game encouraged Zarak 
to make a stronger effort and now the New Zealander took his turn to 
make errors and let Zarak leap ahead to 5-1. But then there was 
another 
spate of errors from the Pakistani and not only was he caught up, but 
Wilson went 8-6 ahead to serve for the match. 
A fluffed volley in search of the winning point put Zarak in hand. 
Zarak produced a backhand crosscourt winner and a forehand boast to 
catch up Wilson and then Wilson hit the tin to put Zarak on game ball. 
But 
an error cost Zarak his first chance to win the game.
Service changed hands six times at 9-all before Zarak broke through to 
win the game with a forehand drop. This brave recovery was of no avail 
as Zarak again lapsed into a stream of errors to lose the fourth game 
in only seven minutes.
The opposition to Jansher from Paul Steel, the World number 27, was 
too weak to give scope to assess his form or his mobility. He played 
rallies at a slow pace and won 9-2, 9-3, 9-5 in 42 minutes.
Mir Zaman Gul clinched victory for Pakistan with his first win. He 
applied himself and won 9-0, 9-7, 9-6 against Wayne Verder whose 
opposition to became stronger and more determined as the match 
progressed. 
Mir Zaman's experience went a long way in tipping the scales in his 
favour. 
ENGLAND WIN Taking a long-term view, Pakistan rested Jansher Khan 
from  their final pool match, against England, in the World Team Squash 
Championship and as good as conceded victory. This was the first 
time Pakistan, the holders, had lost to England in this competition 
since it was thrown open to professionals in 1981. 
Their 2-1 defeat does not by any means put Pakistan out of the 
competition. All it means that they will have to contest a more 
difficult semi-final, almost certainly against Australia.
The rubber Pakistan salvaged was the first of the match, between the 
number three s. One's initial reaction in the circumstances would be 
that Pakistan would have pulled off a win had Jansher played. But the 
fact is that Jansher was in no state of mind or body to have coped on 
the day with a player of Simon Parke's calibre.
This was evident from the struggle he had to beat the little-known 
Anders Thorsen in the match against Sweden on Tuesday. Jansher has 
suffered from having played seven matches in the last nine days. 
Moreover, he had aggravated the blisters on his feet. Playing in a 
match Pakistan were quite likely to lose would have reduced the World 
champion's effectiveness in the rounds to come. 
Pakistan's sole success in the match against England was gained by 
debutante Zubair Jahan Khan, who beat World number seven, Chris 
Walker, after being Swamped in the first two games. 
As would be expected of someone making his first international 
appearance in a crucial match, Zubair was desperately nervous, made a 
mass of unforced errors and lost the first two games in a total time 
of 18 minutes, capturing just three points.
Simon Parke put England level by beating Zubair's elder brother, 
Zarak. Zarak led 7-5 in the first game. But Parke, on the day, was 
quite brilliant. However, the second and third games were not as 
easily won by the Englishman as the scores, 9-2 and 9-3 might suggest. 
Most rallies were long and intense. 
The deciding rubber was won for England by World Open finalist Del 
Harris, against Mir Zaman Gul. Harris was playing his first match in 
the competition after a three-day rest. He was too strong and incisive 
for Mir Zaman and won 9-3, 9-0, 9-3 in only 42 minutes.

<a name="jans">Jansher reaffirms Pak prestige in squash</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
A. Majid Khan
Jansher Khan who last week surpassed Jahangir s record in Nicosia, 
Cyprus, reaffirmed and confirmed Pakistan s domination in the World 
Open squash. His seventh victory in this prestigious event came as a 
whiff of welcome breeze for the country which is reeling under the 
shattering blows currently endangering our reputation in the realm of 
cricket and hockey.
With blisters in his right foot causing much pain, the plucky world 
champion fought resolutely to defend the title for the fourth 
successive year to overcome the hard resistance offered by England s 
Del Harris. Nonetheless Jansher was forced to drop a game for the 
second time in the precious Nicosia World Open, before beating into 
submission the eighth seeded Briton who had created a major upset by 
downing Australia s second seed Rodney Eyles by three games to two in 
the quarter-final.
The Australian challenge seems to have considerably weakened during 
the past three years as no one from that country could reach the World 
Open final. This is a definite setback for a nation, once a formidable 
force and the main challenger against Pakistan in the World Open ever 
since it was instituted in 1975. Englishmen have emerged as strong 
contenders for the Open title with double-fisted Peter Marshall 
reaching the 1994 final and losing to World Number One Jansher Khan by 
3 1 and this time Del Harris lost the battle to the invincible Khan, 
15-10-17-14, 16-17-15-8.
The latest success of Pakistan in Nicosia has given it 13 victories in 
the 20-year history of this prestigious event, thanks first to the six 
times world champion Jahangir Khan (1981 1985, 1988) followed by 
seven victories earned through Jansher (1987, 1989, 1990, 1992 
1995).
He had gone to Nicosia as pre-world open favourite and he maintained 
his reputation as the world s leading player equal to any challenge on 
any court of the world. He has been meeting this challenge to complete 
his 20 months victorious run that began from the Portuguese Open in 
March last after losing in the Leekes Classic in February 1994.
Jansher has virtually monopolised the world squash and his haul of 
this year s super series titles includes apart from the Portuguese 
Open, the British Open, Hong Kong Open, Japan Open and now the World 
Open. He also won the tournament of champions and the US Open while 
skipping the Malaysian open, a super series tournament.
The six victories in a row in the super series events demonstrate his 
awesome power, super fitness, complete control and the technically 
sound as well as all-round excellence.
To achieve this mastery and glory, Jansher keeps himself in top 
physical condition by undergoing a thorough drill and maintaining 
systematic training schedule. With his record of successes and 
remarkable stamina, Jansher seems certain to rule the squash world and 
to extend his domination for another few years. It will not be a 
surprise if like Jahangir Khan, he also goes for the ten-time British 
open mark.
The only apprehension is that of an injury a risk that haunts world 
renowned players in squash. Jahangir Khan, Australia s Chris Dittmar, 
Chris Robertson and Brett Martin all had to leave the international 
circuit because of this problem. Jansher Khan is well aware of this 
factor but has full faith in his physical resources that he conserves 
by avoiding unnecessary stress and strain.
Another consideration that must be weighing on Jansher s mind is that 
he is the lone Pakistani flag-bearer in international squash as we 
have none other at present to uphold the glorious tradition. Zarak 
Jahan Khan and Mir Zaman Gul had passed their peak and none of them 
could win any super event series though they are in the field for many 
years. There is a big gap in the competitive standard of the maestro 
and other renowned players of the country.
Squash families are still producing good stuff and the squash 
authorities are providing the required facilities to train them but we 
cannot say with certainty that we would be able to produce a world 
beater like Jahangir Khan and Jansher Khan in the foreseeable future.

<a name="zama">Zaman wins 3rd match to put Pakistan in final</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dicky Rutnagur
CAIRO, Nov.18 Pakistan, yesterday qualified for the final of the 
World Team Squash Championship beating Australia 2-1 in a semi-final 
which will long be remembered. It was memorable, firstly, for the 
dramatic fashion in which Mir Zaman Gul won the deciding tie and 
secondly for the ugly blotch that his Australian opponent, Anthony 
Hill, smeared on the game s history and traditions with behaviour that 
can only be described as crude and villainous.
Being the character Hill is, he will feel no remorse for his coarse 
and unsporting behaviour, which warrants severe disciplinary action. 
But he will have to live with having been the direct cause of 
Australia losing a match which was within one point of their grasp. He 
held match points at 8-6 and 8-7 in the third game but was too 
agitated to press home his advantage.
Mir Zaman Gul, who had been clearly outplayed in the second game and 
much of the third, had to be admired for keeping his cool in the face 
of grave provocation on the part of the Australian and also some 
highly unjust decisions against him by the referee.
The match was highly physical from the very start and while the 
referee, Tony Parker, of England, repeatedly exhorted the players to 
keep the match free of body contact it was a long time before he took 
direct action and that came about when, after the third game was 
finished, Hill gave Mir Zaman a dig in the back with his elbow. Parker 
came down from his seat in the gallery and rebuked Hill quite sternly 
before he went on court again for the fourth.
The crowd, which had been neutral so far, had noticed the incident and 
turned noisily against Hill, which worked to Mir Zaman s advantage.
Hill hammered another nail into his own coffin by violently shoulder-
charging Mir Zaman and flinging him to the flow at 7-4 in the fourth 
game. Bearing in mind that he had twice struck his opponent with the 
ball, referee Parker awarded a conduct point against the Australian.
At the end of the fourth game, hill flung his racket high and was 
docked another point, which meant that Mir Zaman started the fifth 
game with a point already in his bag.
Hill was so irate and confused at the start of the fifth game that he 
played a series of wanton shots which suggested that he had no 
interest in the match. Mir Zaman had established himself with a 6-0 
lead before Hill calmed down and started to engage himself in rallies. 
But Mir Zaman was so fired up that he comfortably resisted Hill s 
last-ditch effort to come back into contention.
Rodney Eyles, the Australian captain did not say as much. But his 
attitude afterwards not only conveyed disappointment at his team s 
defeat, but shame at the behaviour of one of his players. 
Incidentally, Eyles is the only Australian to have entered the 
Pakistan Open in Karachi this week.
Ironically, the issue in the match would not have hung on the final 
tie between hill and Mir Zaman if, in the opening rubber, Zarak final 
tie between Hill and Mir Zaman had capitalised on match point at 8-5 
in the final game against Brett Martin. Zarak played well enough to 
win, but lost his nerve at the crunch while Martin, as is typical of 
him, was irresistible while he was playing well in spells, but loose 
and error-prone at other times.
The dependable Jansher Khan, despite his fatigue and problems with 
blisters, played staunchly to win the first strings tie against 
Rodney Eyles, who himself gave a very spirited display and took the 
second game, besides offering stern resistance in the fourth, which 
went to setting, Jansher winning it on his second match point.
After an hour and seven minutes play, Jansher led by two games to 
one. But for a lapse of concentration in the second game, Jansher 
could have had the match stitched up in three games.
The opening tie was won by Australia in the closest finish, Brett 
Martin beating Zarak Jahan Khan 7-9, 9-10, 9-0, 9-0, 10-8 after saving 
a match point at 8-5.
Zakrak lost his nerve as the Australian, whose form varied between the 
brilliant and erratic crept up. Four consecutive errors by the 
Pakistani put Martin level and having recovered from a seemingly 
impossible position, would not let go his opportunity. He seized the 
two points of setting with outright winners, the first a whiplash of a 
cross court drive into the nick and the next a clinger.

<a name="lose">Pakistan lose squash final to England</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Dicky Rutnagur
CAIRO, Nov.19 A virtuoso performance by the redoubtable Jansher Khan 
in beating Simon Parke, 9-2, 9-5, 9-4, and a brave last-ditch stand by 
Mir Zaman Gul in the deciding tie provided Pakistan with some 
consolation as they lost the World Team Squash Championship to 
England, who had never won it since the competition was thrown open to 
professionals in 1981.
It must be mentioned to Pakistan s credit that their effort in the 
final was tremendous considering that they had undergone much strain, 
physical and emotional, while winning their semi-final against 
Australia only 24 hours earlier.
England, who had a relatively easy match against Egypt, were given a 
quick start by Del Harris. The swiftness of his win over Zarak Jahan 
Khan, 9-1, 9-2, 9-2 in only 43 minutes must have boosted English 
morale no end.
Zarak, to an extent, contributed to the loss of the first game through 
a few unforced errors but thereafter, it was the firm authority of 
Harris, losing finalist to Jansher in the World Open final a week 
earlier, that subdued Zarak. Not only was Harris accurate with his 
shots, of which he exhibited a large variety, but he kept the pace 
slow. it is speed that the athletic and acrobatic Zarak likes, for he 
has a penchant for feeding of pace.
Jansher had it very much his own way in the first and third games 
against Simon Parke. But the Englishman himself played thoughtful, 
high-quality squash with great determination in the second, which 
lasted 36 minutes and was the longest of the whole tournament.
It was fought at a slow pace, but was captivating for the precision 
with which both players executed their shots delighted with the 
deception contained in his strokes, which often had Parke running 
furiously to reach the ball. To his credit, the Englishman reacted 
with fast reflexes.
Jansher led 6-0, but Parke narrowed the gap to 4-6 before Jansher made 
further progress. Parke saved three game points before Jansher 
captured it with a clinger. The World champion needed only another 
nine minutes to put the seal on his supremacy. He went to 7-0 without 
losing service and although he then lost four point through a series 
of errors, he took the remaining points in one hand.
The English victory was completed by Mark Chaloner, who a year ago, 
was ranked 19 in England and 49 in the World. Today his national 
ranking is four and international, 16. He reached the quarter-finals 
of the Open, beating Brett Martin but he was in the England team only 
because Peter Marshall pulled out. He was selected for the match in 
preference to Chris Walker, who had a World ranking of seven.
Although his first international appearance was only five days 
earlier, Chaloner played in mature fashion to beat Mir Zaman 9-1, 9-3, 
10-9. Despite his ordeal of the previous night with the truculent 
Anthony Hill, Mir Zaman played the best squash he has played in this 
tournament.
But the Englishman was good enough to take the first two games at a 
total cost of only four points in 27 minutes. However, Mir Zaman 
fought him all the way in the third, saved two match points at 8-6, 8-
7 and 9-all before Chaloner broke through, a double boast by Mir Zaman 
from  the back of the court hitting the very top of the tin.

<a name="sham">Shams Kakar creates first upset in squash</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Majid A. Khan
KARACHI, Nov.22 Talented and promising Shamsul Islam Khan Kakar, 
brought about a major upset overcoming Germany s world No.25 Hansi 
Wiens by three games to one on the opening day of the five-day 15th 
Pakistan Open squash here on Wednesday at the PIA Jahangir Khan Squash 
Complex.
Shams Kakar of PIA turned in an amazing performance for the 43-minute 
17-4, 16-17, 15-11, 15-11 victory on his way to the second round.
In another upset of the day Canadian qualifier Jonathan Power powered 
ahead by inflicting a shocking 15-1, 15-7, 15-10 win on Paul Steel, 
New Zealand s world No.26. Jonathan Power virtually outplayed his 
rival who committed several unforced errors when the Canadian exerted 
pressure with his drops and volleys.
Shams Kakar gave an extraordinary performance against German Hansi 
Wiens who carries rich international experience. Kakar fought with 
admirable courage and determination in an enthralling encounter that 
produced several long and short rallies, punctuated with placements, 
angles and crosscourt shots.
However after winning the fiercely-contested first game at 17-14 Hansi 
Wiens staged a comeback winning an equally well fought second game 17-
16.
Shams Kakar took the third game in a commanding way 15-11 with a 
series of winners as the German turned erratic. One game up Kakar 
played brilliantly and superbly to dominate the fourth game to win the 
match at 15-11.
Tomorrow he faces world No.12 Zarak Jahan Khan, seeded sixth, who 
today had to stay on the court for one hour and one minute to beat 
Sindh Open champion and qualifier Komail Mahmood 15-5, 15-11, 15-12.
Zarak secured an expected victory over ever-improving Kumail Mahmood 
who is almost ten years younger in age and experience.
The match to some extent was marred by poor refereeing of Jamshed Gul 
who took every follower of the game, including both the players, by 
surprise when he called for stopping a long rally when Zarak was 7-5 
in front in the last third game. it was a delightful rally full of 
powerful drives, lobs and placements when the referee stopped it. Both 
players looked towards referee Jamshed Gul to know what has gone 
wrong. The referee for a few second remained quiet and then called 
let. He failed to state who committed what fault.
Zarak heavily relied on the power game and also controlled the pace 
with youthful Kumail Mahmood displaying tactical game producing 
backhand and forehand drops, angles and lobs. Kumail was involved in 
long rallies and the longest 83-stroke rally in the first game was 
finally ended when Zarak s disguised drop caught his young challenger 
on the wrong foot.
After taking the first game at 15-5 Zarak Jahan Khan went ahead 7-4. 
Another rally of 78 strokes followed and this time Kumail finished 
with a perfect forehand drop 5-7. Zarak further accelerated the pace 
and was 13-10 ahead winning 15-11 Kumail tinned.
The third game was a close affair as score stood 4-4 and later with 
two strokes Zarak was 7-5. Kumail fought back 7-7 but Zarak was 9-7 
up. Kumail steadied his game and after getting a stroke he was 8-9. 
Zarak thrice tinned and Kumail for the first time gained 12-9 lead 
with remarkable volley to the nick.
Zarak turned ruthless and with a series of drops took six points in a 
row as Kumail committed mistakes. Zarak won the match at 15-12.
In another upset Mark Chaloner defeated eighth seed Stephen Mead s 15-
11, 15-8, 15-5 in an all-England encounter.
World champion Jansher Khan, termed favourite to retain the title, had 
the better of South African qualifier Graig Vander Wath 15-9, 15-8, 
17-15.
Top seeded Jansher Khan started in a whirlwind fashion by taking an 
authoritative 11-0 lead over Wath in one hand in the first game which 
he won at 15-9 after the three-time former South African champion made 
a late rally.
The great Khan demonstrated all his court game for a 15-8 success in 
the second but the third game turned out to be a close affair.
Wath played more cautiously in the third and did hit several angles 
and drop shots as Jansher Khan committed unforced errors.
After 4-4 Wath s return was out and the South African protested 
against referee Gogi s decision for awarding a stroke. Jansher was 7-5 
ahead but Wath recovered to be 7-7 also getting a stroke. Jansher 
trailed 8-10 and made it 10-10 when his rival appeal for lets were 
turned down. however, after 12-all Jansher again took the lead 14-12 
before the South African made it 14-all and at this stage the ball 
burst. A new ball was taken. Wath came closer to snatch a game but at 
15-14 his forehand drive hit the board 15-15. Jansher got a stroke and 
was 16-15 up.
A good rally followed and in a drop duel Jansher was home with 17-15 
with Wath protesting in vain against the referee s decision.
Other seeded stars however, were through to the next round.

<a name="332i">Pakistan 33-2 in reply to Australia s 267 in 2nd test</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
from Qamar Ahmed
HOBART, Nov. 17 It would have been a satisfying first day for 
Pakistan, had they not lost their two wickets for 33 at the close of 
play after bowling Australia out for 267 in the first innings of the 
second Test at the Bellerive Oval.
Leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmed s 5 for 115 in Australia s far from 
impressive batting performance deserved to be complimented in a much 
better fashion than it was.
Having lost two wickets in nine overs and only 40 minutes play 
remaining. There is plenty to be done to survive, and see that they 
manage a lead. Failing that, there could be trouble in store.
Saleem Elahi, who struggled for 23 minutes for his 13, did not seem to 
have any clue to negotiate Craig McDermott and Glen McCrath. He played 
onto his stumps in McGrath s third over when 13 and the night-watchman 
Mushtaq Ahmad who earlier on had picked up his first haul of five 
wickets in his 19th Test, was leg before in the same over off his next 
ball. Aamir Sohail and Ramiz Raja barely saw the day off without any 
further damage.
It certainly does not augur well for the rest of the batting which has 
already been jolted by Shane Warne in the first Test.
McGrath is not the only threat on a wicket which is seaming on which 
Wasim Akram bowled superbly for his 3 for 42 but also McDermott and 
Paul Reiffel could be as dangerous. Not to mention Shane Warne who has 
the ability to exploit any kind of wicket and will surely be 
encouraged by the fact that little Mushtaq has tricked his colleagues 
on the same surface after Mark Taylor had won the toss and decided to 
bat.
Mushtaq, one of the two changes in the Pakistan side besides Salim 
Malik, bowled magnificently. Playing in place of off-spinner Saqlain 
Mushtaq, he was brought in the 15th over with Australia on 37 for one 
and he bowled unchanged till after tea having sent 27 overs for 95 
runs for his three wickets. He was back again after three overs to bag 
two more wickets and with it to destroy the Australian middle order as 
well.
With Waqar Younis not in full flight and Mohammad Akram, not bowling 
well in this match, Mushtaq s inclusion must have come as a blessing 
in disguise for Wasim Akram and the rest.
Had Moin Khan not dropped a difficult leg side chance when Mark Waugh 
flicked one to leg off Wasim Akram when he was 17, things perhaps 
could have been a lot rosier. Waugh finished with 88 runs to delay the 
demise of the Australian innings.
Michael Slater survived an appeal on the first ball of Wasim Akram 
when he was trapped but was not on the last delivery of the first 
over. David Boon and Mark Taylor then shared a 68-run partnership for 
the second wicket. A throw from Ijaz Ahmed, who had replaced injured 
Salim Malik saw Boon off as he was sent back attempting a single. Boon 
had made 34. Umpire Dickie Bird sought the help of the third umpire 
but the video link was not in operation and he had to decide himself 
on the run-out.
from 91 for 2 at lunch Australia added another 103 runs in the second 
session to lose Taylor for 43, Steve Waugh for 7 and Greg Blewett for 
0. Taylor played onto Wasim, Waugh was caught at the wicket off 
Mushtaq while cutting and Blewett was bowled off a googly.
Ian Healy, who was dropped by Ramiz Raja off Mushtaq at mid-wicket, 
was later caught by Basit for 37 having put on 55 with Mark Waugh for 
the sixth wicket. The last five wickets were gone with 56 runs added 
as Australia collapsed but not before Waugh made 88 in 223 minutes 
stay with eight fours and not before Warne had hit three sixes off 
Mushtaq to prolong the innings.

<a name="inth">Pakistan in trouble in 2nd test also</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
HOBART, Nov.18 Pakistan in the absence of the ace Australian leg-
spinner Shane Warne who has been ruled out of this match because of a 
broken toe in his left foot, floundered a golden opportunity to make a 
sizeable score and take a firm grip on the second Test being played at 
Bellerive Oval.
Instead they are now faced with the prospect of yet another defeat 
after being restricted in the first innings to 198 to concede a 
respectable lead of 69 on the first innings to Australia who at the 
close of play had enhanced their chances further by increasing it to 
176 having scored 107 in their second innings. Mark Taylor with 42 and 
Michael Slater with 62 had seen the afternoon off without being 
separated.
Four stoppages during the day, one before lunch and three in, the 
afternoon because of bad light caused a loss of 82 minutes play but 
that was compensated with an extended hour s play. But it certainly is 
no excuse for Pakistan s batting failure. They were no good. Lacking 
in application they flustered against Glen McGrath, Paul Reiffel and 
Craig McDermott on a wicket which held no terror for them.
McGrath had 3 for 46, Reiffel picked up 4 for 38 and McDermott 2 for 
72 with Steve Waugh joining them with the prized wicket of Inzamam-ul-
Haq who made 27 after 88 minutes of defiance.
If not for a determined knock of 59 by Ramiz Raja, things perhaps 
could have been much more nauseating. One however shudders to think 
the fate of Pakistan s blighted first innings if Warne was available.
He was declared unfit before the start of play on the second day after 
it was discovered that the ball which hit him from Waqar Younis when 
he came in to bat on the first day had chipped his left foot toe bone. 
With the knowledge that he may be out for at least fortnight, the 
Pakistan batsmen should have elevated their spirits but once again 
they ceased to rise to the occasion.
Even Ijaz Ahmed, who battled for nearly two hours for his unbeaten 34 
failed to save them from the inevitable. For a disjointed batting 
line-up like this there is no guarantee that in the second knock they 
will come out better. The pressure of a target of over 300 could be 
humiliating. The writing apparently seems to be already on the wall 
but things do happen in this game.
Pakistan had resumed the day at 33 for 2 and had taken their score to 
78 at lunch when rain halted play for 54 minutes. On resumption Aamir 
Sohail was caught at the wicket by Ian Healy low down for 32 off 
Reiffel. Taylor in the slip gasped in amazement when Darrell Hair, the 
Australian umpire, raised his finger. Sohail was not happy.
With Ramiz he had added 55 runs for the third wicket. Ramiz dropped by 
McDermott at long leg off Reiffel when 35 then hit three fours in a 
row off McDermott on the off side to reach his 19th fifty in Tests 
with the help of six fours. Sixteen runs were taken off McDermott s 
12th over. But when 59 Ramiz was deceived off a slower ball and was 
caught and bowled by Reiffel.
Inzamam seemed to be steady but he too perished when he flicked one to 
leg from Steve Waugh. Basit Ali made 2 before being given out by Hair 
playing half forward.
Moin Khan played across the line and had his stumps flattened when 12 
and Pakistan at tea, with 178 for 7, were on way to disaster.
Wasim Akram slogged after tea and Taylor, who rarely misses any chance 
in the slips, got both hands to catch Wasim on 2. Waqar Younis was off 
the mark with two fours in a row off McDermott. He was dropped too off 
him when 8 Slater but Reiffel had him taken at point for 10 and then 
in the same over had Mohammad Akram leg before.

<a name="herc">Herculean task in 2nd test for Pakistan</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
HOBART, Nov.19 Faced with a monumental task of making 376 runs to win 
the second Test, Pakistan in the 10 overs remaining made 15 with loss 
at the close of the third day against Australia at Bellerive Oval. Two 
full day s play remain in the game and time is not the significant 
factor, but the main things are survival and runs. The wicket is 
ideal, the Australian bowling is limited and in the absence of the 
leg-spinner Shane Warne, the score is attainable but only if two of 
the frontline batsmen share a sizeable stand.
The target here is formidable because of the fact that so far in the 
last three innings of the present series, Pakistan has not been able 
to pass even 250 runs. The frontline batsmen have the ability but they 
lack application and reliability. They have also suffered a setback at 
the start of their second innings when Aamir Sohail had to retire hurt 
in the third over after being struck on the left leg off Craig 
McDermott delivery.
Amir s contribution could be a major factor if Pakistan is able to get 
any where near the required score or past it. The form of the rest of 
the batsmen except Inzamam does not promise much.
If only they had not allowed an opportunity slip in the first innings 
and had taken a lead things could have been a lot encouraging. The 
Pakistan bowlers, however, once again played their team back in the 
game on the third morning. Australia with 107 without loss and with an 
overall lead of 176 had looked formidable but within 47 minutes of 
play they had lost three wickets, that of Michael Slater, David Boon 
and Mark Waugh with only 25 runs added.
A century (123) by Mark Taylor however dashed any hope that Pakistan 
had of minimising the lead. Australia with 306 for 9 then left 
Pakistan on their own mercy.
Mushtaq Ahmed and Wasim Akram with 4 for 83 and 3 for 72 had still 
done a great job to restrict Australia. The first to go in the morning 
was Slater who added only 11 more runs to his 62 overnight. His 
opening stand with Taylor was ended by a Mushtaq flipper which trapped 
him in front. His 73 contained eight fours and a six.
Boon, having survived a leg before appeal against Muashtaq, cut him 
sluggishly to Waqar Younis at point before he had scored.
Taylor, who had resumed at 42 reached his fifty with four fours in 144 
minutes stay and later Mark Waugh, playing in his fiftieth Test, 
chopped a delivery from Wasim Akram on his stumps when 3.
At lunch Australia with 167 for 3 led by 236 runs. Taylor and Steve 
Waugh added 57 runs for the fourth wicket before Waugh was caught at 
the wicket off Mohammad Akram for 29 but Taylor reached his 14th Test 
century before a shaky Greg Blewett was dismissed by Wasim Akram for 
11.
Taylor s patient hundred had come in 309 minutes batting with ten 
fours. He also had another valuable stand of 44 for the fifth wicket 
before Blewett departed.
In the second session 87 runs were added. Pakistan s patchy ground 
fielding and some erratic bowling by Mohammad Akram also helped 
Australia s cause.
Taylor was yorked after tea by Waqar, Paul Reiffel misjudged a googly 
from  Mushtaq but Ian Healy and McDermott put on 40 runs for the eighth 
wicket to rally the innings. Mushtaq and Wasim then struck to dismiss 
McDermott for 20 and Healy for 24.

<a name="maul">Pakistan mauled in 2nd test, lose series</a>
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Qamar Ahmed
HOBART, Nov.20 A defeat in the second Test was inevitable. It could 
have been delayed but not avoided. After tea on the fourth day it did 
come when Australia having set a mammoth target of 376 to win, bowled 
Pakistan out for 220 in their second innings to win the match by 155 
runs and thus take the series 2-0 to claim themselves the champions of 
Test cricket.
Their victory against Pakistan virtually confirms their status now, 
though unofficially. The outcome of this Test at Bellerive Oval became 
very much predictable from the second day when Pakistan failed to take 
a first innings lead after bowling Australia out cheaply (267) in the 
first innings.
The decisions given against some of the Pakistan batsmen were 
surprising and atrocious. Bird, as we all know has a good, and Hair, 
true to his reputation was as much to be blamed. Ageing Bird not only 
messed it up for Pakistan by declaring Ramiz Raja and Inzamam-ul-Haq 
leg before off deliveries high out but with it dented his reputation.
Everyone agreed, including the Australian Press. Sadly the players 
can t talk about it because of the ICC code of conduct which has no 
provisions to challenge the mistakes of umpires but has all the power 
to punish the players, on occasions unjustifiably.
Their displeasure over detestable umpiring was further compounded by 
the ICC referee Raman Subba Row s decision to fine Aamir Sohail 50 per 
cent of his match fee and impose a deferred two match sentence for 
breach of Rule 2 of ICC s code of conduct regarding bringing the game 
in disrepute.
His crime, according to the referee, was that the batsman threw his 
bat following his dismissal. Sohail was harshly treated. He did not 
deserve what he got. After being caught at square leg by Brendon 
Julian, the substitute for Warne off Greg Blewett when well set on 57, 
he was disgusted by himself to have played a bad shot. Walking back to 
the pavilion he had banged the turf in disappointment. The bat fell 
off his hand and he had not thrown it in the air or in dissent. Surely 
the referee should have taken that into consideration. But he didn t. 
It was shocking.
Not that Pakistan had lost the Test and the series that they showed 
their disgust about it but they deserved a lot better for their effort 
in the second innings in trying circumstances.
If not for poor umpiring, Pakistan from 132 for 3 could have pulled up 
a surprise or at least could have managed to reduce the margin of 
defeat.
Pakistan had started the fourth day s play at 15 without loss and 
staring in the face of an imminent defeat. After 12 runs Saleem Elahi 
was taken by David Boon at short leg off a bouncer from Glen McGrath 
when 17. Lacking in technique he could not fend and lobbed the ball in 
the air.
Ramiz Raja, who had scored 59 in the first innings, once again 
appeared to be in the right frame of find while making 25 in 122 
minutes was given out by Dickie Bird when Craig McDermott hit him on 
the pad. The ball was rearing up and could have missed even the sixth 
stump. With Sohail who had come in at the fall of the first wicket he 
had added 35 runs for the second wicket.
At lunch Pakistan with 82 for 2 still required 286 runs to win. The 
target was a long way away but in sight considering the way in which 
Sohail had taken control. He reached his fifty in 127 minutes batting 
with five fours to go past a 50 partnership in 54 minutes.
Blewett s sudden introduction in the attack resulted his exit. On the 
third ball of his first over he drove uppishly to leg and was caught 
when 57 but not before he had put on 70 runs with Inzamam-ul-Haq for 
the third wicket.
Ijaz Ahmed, was off the mark with a four to mid-wicket off McDermott 
but fell to Blewett when 4 while padding outside the off stump. It was 
a shocking decision by umpire Hair. Not much later Inzamam who had 
started to blossom with 40 already made was given out leg before to 
Paul Reiffel while trying to pull a rising delivery.
Basit Ali was bowled for 5 by Reiffel, attempting a drive and leaving 
a big gap between bat and pad to continue with his poor form in Tests. 
In the last 11 innings in Tests he has now made only 77 runs and in 
the last eight innings against Australia a mere 48 runs, which 
certainly does not augur well for a man who is so much rich in talent.
With his dismissal, the gates were now open for the Australians who 
had reduced Pakistan to 178 for 6 at tea.
Wasim Akram in desperation hit a few lusty blows on the on side and 
through the covers. One hit from him landed in the crowd at extra 
cover when he drove McGrath. At 33 he was caught by Blewett off 
McGrath having put on 48 runs for the seventh wicket.
With Moin Khan who became one of the three victims of the new ball 
which was taken at 206 for 7, Mark Waugh took a simple catch in the 
second slip to see him off McGrath. The bowler struck again by taking 
Waqar Younis caught at mid-off and bowling Mushtaq Ahmed - McGrath s 
reward being 5 for 61. Reiffel had 3 for 42 and Blewett 2 for 25 to 
bring victory to Australia.</pre>
