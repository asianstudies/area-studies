<a name="sena">Senate election on Nov 12: Nominations from 19th: EC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Aug 16: The Election Commission announced the schedule 
for elections to the National and provincial assemblies to be held 
on Oct 10.

The Election Commission announced that the election to the Senate 
would now be held on Nov 12, exactly one month after the deadline 
fixed by the Supreme Court for holding of the NA, PAs and Senate 
elections.

The senator from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) would 
be elected through direct vote on Oct 10.

Candidates have been asked to file nomination papers from Aug 19 to 
24. Returning Officers would scrutinize nomination papers from Aug 
25 to 31.

Candidates or their rivals would be able to file appeals against 
the decision of Retuning Officers, accepting or rejecting the 
nomination papers, till Sept 4.

Last date for withdrawal of candidature has been fixed at Sept 12. 
On the next day, Sept 13, the revised list of candidates will be 
published.

Polling for election to the National and provincial assemblies and 
Senate (only in the Fata) will be held on Oct 10. The same program 
will apply to the seats reserved for women and minorities in the 
National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Punjab, Sindh, the 
NWFP and Balochistan.

Official notification issued on Friday stated the position about 
the Senate election. It said it was earlier announced that the 
elections for the Senate would also be held on Oct 10.

A large number of people, political leaders and political parties 
had desired that the election to the Senate be held according to 
existing scheme of the Constitution, it added.

The original scheme for holding election to the Senate provided 
that the senators from the provinces were to be elected by the 
members of the provincial assemblies and from the federal capital 
by the members of the National Assembly.

"The election to the Senate cannot, therefore, be held till such 
time that the elections to the National Assembly and Provincial 
Assemblies are complete, the members have taken oath, the Speaker 
and Deputy Speakers have been elected and thereafter a reasonable 
period is provided for filing and scrutiny of papers," the 
notification said.

The general seats for National Assembly had been increased from 207 
to 272 after delimitation of the constituencies in the light of 
census results.

The government has also increased the representation of women in 
the National and provincial assemblies.

The elections would be held on joint electorate basis, first time 
after 1977 election. Besides, the government has withdrawn its 
proposal for the withdrawal of the special seats for the minorities 
and has restored these.

Candidates on the reserved seats for women and non-Muslims will be 
elected through proportional representation system of political 
parties lists of candidates on the basis of total number of general 
seats won by each political party in a provincial assembly. The 
independents would have no say in the election of women seats.

The law provides that every political party would have to give a 
list of candidates for the seats reserved for women and minorities, 
in order of priority.

A political party securing less than five per cent of the total 
number of general seats in the National Assembly will not be 
entitled to any reserved seat for women or non-Muslims.

The Punjab Assembly will consist of 372 seats, including 66 
reserved seats for women and nine for minorities. Similarly, the 
Sindh Assembly will have a total strength of 167 members, including 
29 seats for women and eight for minorities. Balochistan Assembly 
will consist of 65 members, including 11 women and three minority 
members; and NWFP Assembly will consist of 124 members, including 
22 women and three minority members.

The government has amended the Representation of People's Act, 
empowering the Returning Officers to reject the nomination papers 
of any candidate on the basis of information received from "any 
source."

<a name="parl">Parliament can reject changes, EU told</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 16: Chairman of the National Reconstruction Bureau, 
Lt Gen Tanveer Naqvi assured European Union electoral observation 
mission that the constitutional reforms being introduced are not 
reversible and subject to approval by future parliament.

"Constitutional amendments would stand unless there is a negative 
resolution approved by the parliament," Naqvi told the EU observer.

"Parliament is sovereign and it can do whatever it likes and the 
Constitution clearly lays down the procedure in this regard," Naqvi 
said.

The European Union mission, who had been criticized for interfering 
in Pakistan's internal affairs, met the NRB chairman here on 
Friday.

According to an official announcement, chief of the mission 
Cashnahan in his meeting with the NRB chief explained the role of 
his mission and said the EU has a universally recognized criteria 
for observing elections process in different countries and it would 
not interfere in the internal politics of any country.

Gen Naqvi briefed the mission about the proposed National Security 
Council and said it would be a consultative body and an executive 
or quasi-executive body. The objective behind establishing it was 
to bring stability to democratic system, he added.

He also explained the rationale behind introduction of the 
condition of graduation for the candidates to the elected 
institutions.

The NRB chairman also informed the mission about the role of 
Election Commission. "Election Commission derives its role directly 
from the Constitution and is an autonomous body, which conducts 
elections strictly in accordance with the parameters of its defined 
role laid in the Constitution," he said.

Replying to another question regarding link between EC and NRB in 
the backdrop of local government elections, the NAB chairman said 
election commission interacted with the NRB because it was a new 
system requiring more understanding and clarity.

<a name="delh">Delhi's charges of cross-border terrorism rejected</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: Pakistan on Thursday rejected the allegations of 
cross-border terrorism hurled by Indian prime minister in his 
speech on the Independence Day of India. Such accusations were 
routinely levelled by the Indian leaders to cover up the reign of 
terror let loose by the Indian security forces in the Indian 
Occupied Kashmir, a foreign office spokesman said.

In the face of India's own sordid record of fomenting terrorism 
across South Asia during the past several decades, he described the 
Indian prime minister's reference to 'double standard' as 
hypocritical.

He also took exception to the Indian prime minister's assertion 
that Jammu and Kashmir was an integral part of India. This 
statement, he said, was contrary to international legality as 
reflected in the relevant UN Security Council Resolution on the 
Jammu and Kashmir dispute.

Such a statement reflected India's colonial mindset, its disregard 
for morality, and its intention to persist with its illegal control 
over the Indian-Occupied Kashmir through brute force. This Indian 
attitude was the principal impediment in the way of a peaceful and 
just settlement of the Kashmir dispute.

He reiterated Pakistan's rejection of the election being planned 
for the Indian-Occupied Kashmir. Besides, the illegitimate nature 
of this exercise, all such elections had been blatantly rigged in 
the past and had been rejected by the Kashmiri people.

He questioned the credibility of an election conducted in the 
presence of 700,000 strong Indian occupation force with license to 
kill. He pointed out that despite enormous Indian pressure, the 
APHC had refused to take part in the fraudulent elections.

However, he welcomed India's desire to live with Pakistan as a good 
neighbour and Mr Vajpayee's observation about resolving the dispute 
through talks.

He emphasized that Pakistan had already made repeated offers to 
India for the resumption of a meaningful dialogue to resolve all 
outstanding disputes, including Kashmir.

<a name="mush">Musharraf vows to hold fair polls: Kashmir elections rejected </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: President Gen Pervez Musharraf gave a firm 
assurance to the nation on Wednesday that the October elections 
would be free, fair and transparent.

Addressing a select gathering on the 55th Independence Day, the 
president said: "On this solemn occasion, let me give the whole 
nation a personal guarantee... I will take all possible measures to 
ensure a free, fair and a transparent election" with a view to 
restoring democracy.

"Our government has taken a number of steps to encourage a change 
and bring in new leadership," he said, adding that the voter's age 
had been reduced to 18 years and minimum educational qualification 
of BA had been introduced for the candidates. The step, he 
believed, would stop looters, criminals, defaulters, and tax-
evaders from entering the assemblies.

The president urged people to understand the value of their vote 
and told them to vote for those who could serve the nation with 
honesty, sincerity and dedication.

The president urged Ulema, religious parties and other 
organizations to come forward to protect Islam from distortion and 
abuse.

Gen Musharraf emphasized that resolution of the Kashmir dispute was 
imperative for a durable peace in South Asia and added that the 
struggle for self-determination of Kashmiris was a sacred trust 
which could never be compromised.

He reiterated Pakistan's support to the struggle of the people of 
occupied Kashmir for their right to self-determination promised to 
them by the international community.

Reiterating Pakistan's strong desire for a peaceful settlement of 
the Kashmir and all other outstanding issues, Gen Musharraf made it 
abundantly clear that Pakistan would never be subdued by coercion. 
He, however, said that Pakistan believed in peace.

He warned that no one should dare think of any adventurism across 
"our borders". He assured the nation that its armed forces were 
standing guard on the country's borders. The armed forces, he said, 
would not only defend every inch of the motherland but carry the 
fight across the border.

The president said that the announcement by India to hold elections 
in occupied Kashmir was yet another attempt to give a mask of 
legitimacy to its illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir. He said 
Pakistan's position on the issue was based on the Security Council 
resolutions that elections cannot be a substitute for a free and 
impartial plebiscite to be held under the auspices of the world 
body.

He pointed out that the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, the sole 
credible voice of Kashmiri people, had already rejected the holding 
of such elections. He said if the past was any guide the elections 
planned by India would once again take place without participation 
of the Kashmiri people and they were only designed to obtain pre-
determined results.

The president said India claimed that peaceful elections in 
occupied Kashmir would be a test of Pakistan's sincerity for a 
dialogue with New Delhi. Terming it a self-serving argument, he 
said Pakistan cannot accept any responsibility for the developments 
taking place inside occupied Kashmir nor can India blame the 
failure of elections on Pakistan.

Referring to the government's achievements during the last three 
years, he said: "We have demonstrated to the world that good 
governance, economic progress and elimination of corruption is 
possible in Pakistan. The world accepted this now".

He pointed out that this was no mean achievement when compared with 
the despair and despondency prevailing in 1999. At that time, he 
said, the target was revival of fledgling economy, strengthening of 
the federation, improving law and order, de- politicizing state 
institutions, introduction of a system of accountability, and 
rebuilding of national confidence. He observed that substantial 
progress had been made on this agenda during the short period of 
less than three years.

The president said the government had decided to rebuild the state 
institutions and undertake fundamental and far-reaching reforms to 
ensure sustainability and long-lasting growth. He said his 
government's strategy was to get out of debt trap and reschedule 
debt to get fiscal space. The resources thus spared were being used 
on development projects, he added.

Gen Musharraf paid tribute to Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, 
Allama Iqbal and other heroes of the freedom struggle who had 
fought against all odds to create a new homeland for the Muslims of 
South Asia.

Addressing the youth, the president said: "We have tried to create 
conditions for you to take charge and steer the country ahead to 
progress and prosperity." He advised them to build high character 
and honour.

The colorful ceremony was attended by ministers, services chiefs, 
diplomats, civil and military officials, prominent citizens and 
thousands of students. The young boys and girls were carrying 
miniature Pakistani flags which they warmly waved during the 
proceedings of function.

A group of children presented patriotic songs, enthralling the 
audience. After the ceremony, the president went to them and 
appreciated their national spirit.

Earlier, the president unfurled the national flag. It was preceded 
by the sounding of sirens across the country at 7.59am. After the 
flag-hoisting, the participants of the ceremony and the entire 
nation joined in singing the national anthem.

<a name="scre">SC refuses to pass any direction: LG polls in Islamabad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: The Supreme Court declined to pass any direction 
to the government for holding local government elections in the 
federal capital, saying that the fundamental rights including 
political rights of citizens had been suspended by the proclamation 
of emergency.

The court made these observations on a petition filed by the editor 
of an English daily.

The three-judge bench, comprising Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqi, 
Justice Qazi Mohammad Farooq and Justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal, did 
not dispose of the writ petition and allowed the counsel to submit 
news clippings on which he wanted to rely.

The court adjourned the case without issuing notice to any of the 
respondents or fixing the date for next hearing.

The counsel for the petitioner stated that the government had 
adopted discriminatory attitude towards the Islamabad Capital 
Territory which was the only place in the country where local 
government elections had not been held.

He contended that the local government elections were held in the 
country at a time when the same proclamation of emergency was in 
force. He said the dispute between NRB and interior ministry had 
resulted in denial of fundamental rights to the citizens of 
Islamabad. 

The petitioner stated that the local councils were the first tier 
of the democratic process as they performed municipal functions. 
Besides, the local bodies formed the training ground for future 
political leaders of national stature, he added.

The petitioner also recalled that interior minister Lt-Gen 
Moeenunddin Haider had announced during the referendum campaign in 
his capacity as the minister in charge of capital administration 
that the local government elections would be held in Islamabad 
before September 2002. However, no practical steps have been taken 
so far for holding the elections, the petitioner regretted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: The Chief Election Commissioner, Mr Justice 
Irshad Hasan Khan, on Tuesday directed the Returning Officers not 
to entertain the nomination papers of sitting federal and 
provincial ministers and governors of the provinces, for contesting 
the general election until they resigned from their offices.

The Chief Election Commissioner has been repeatedly asking the 
sitting ministers desirous of contesting the forthcoming general 
election, to resign from their offices before filing the nomination 
papers.

The election schedule for the general election is expected within a 
couple of days.

After a meeting of the Election Commission held here, the Chief 
Election Commissioner directed the Returning Officers throughout 
the country not to entertain the nomination papers of all those 
sitting federal and provincial ministers and governors of the 
provinces who were willing to contest election to national and 
provincial assemblies or Senate, until they relinquished their 
respective offices before filing the nomination papers, an 
announcement of the Election Commission said.

The Chief Election Commissioner said that the principle of 
neutrality and impartiality demanded that incumbent ministers 
relinquished their offices before filing their nomination papers or 
be asked to resign by the President well before the election day.

He said that an incumbent minister willing to contest election, 
would enjoy inherent advantages, which would not be available to 
the opposing candidate and it would be unfair.

EC turns down Ijaz's registration request
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: The Election Commission (EC) turned down on 
Tuesday the request of Ijazul Haq for registration of another 
faction of Pakistan Muslim League, saying that it was inconceivable 
that elections of his party were held on Aug 3, when he was member 
of the PML(QA) till Aug 4.

The application of the PML (Ziaul Haq Shaheed Group), filed by Mr 
Haq, was returned by the EC on Tuesday.

In its order, the EC stated that the application of the PML (Ziaul 
Haq Shaheed Group) was returned as contemplated under rule 10 of 
the Political Parties Rules, 2002.

The EC stated that till Aug 4, Ijazul Haq was member of the 
Pakistan Muslim League (QA). "It is, therefore, inconceivable that 
his party could have come into existence and its election held on 
August 3, 2002."

Mr Haq, had contested PML(QA) intra-party election on Aug 3 and was 
defeated by Mian Azhar.

The application, which he submitted in the Election Commission, 
stated that he had formed political party on Aug 3 and its intra-
party elections were held on the same day.

<a name="scad">SC admits petition of PML-QA: Delimitation of constituencies</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: The Supreme Court admitted a petition 
challenging the delimitation of five provincial assembly 
constituencies of the Lahore district. The petition alleged that 
the constituencies were altered to favour a government-backed 
candidate of the PML(QA).

The bench - comprising Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui, Justice Qazi 
Mohammad Farooq and Justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal - heard Advocate 
Chaudhry Mushtaq before issuing notice to the election commission. 
The apex court required the election commission to submit comments. 
It, however, fixed no date for the next hearing.

The petitioner, Raja Munawar Ahmad, challenged the delimitation of 
PP 151, 152, 161, 168 and 169 on the grounds that it had been 
altered in such a way that Arshad Imran Sulehri, a likely candidate 
of the PML(QA), would take benefit of it.

The petitioner stated that PP-151 comprised a population of more 
than 300,000 against 247,857 prescribed by the election commission 
as the average population for a provincial assembly constituency.

It was stated before the apex court that the principle of 
compactness had been violated inasmuch as that not only the town 
forming PP-151 had been bifurcated, but the small administrative 
divisions had also been bifurcated. Meanwhile, Chief Election 
Commissioner Justice Irshad Hasan Khan told a press conference on 
Monday that to make the process of delimitation transparent, 
objections to the preliminary delimitation of constituencies were 
invited from entitled voters.

He said the election commission had received 945 representations 
against preliminary delimitation of 849 constituencies, out of 
which 307 pertain to the National Assembly and 638 to the 
provincial assemblies.

The objections, he said, were heard and disposed of by the election 
commission, members.

The CEC stated that 92 writ petitions were filed in the four high 
courts challenging the delimitation of the constituencies out of 
which 58 had been dismissed and 40 were pending adjudication.

<a name="defa">Defaulters cannot contest polls: EC </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 10: A bank loan default amounting to Rs2 million and 
of utility bills totalling Rs10,000 or more would rob a person of 
the chance to run for the upcoming polls, the Election Commission 
of Pakistan notified on Saturday.

A candidate aspiring to contest the elections will have to submit a 
declaration with the nomination papers that no loan for an amount 
of two million rupees or more, obtained from any bank, financial 
institution, cooperative society or corporation body in his own 
name or in the name of his spouse or any of his dependents or any 
business concern mainly owned by them or the aforesaid, stands 
unpaid for more than one year from the due date or has got such 
loan written off.

A candidate in a separate declaration will have to state that he, 
or his spouse or any of his dependents or a business concern mainly 
owned by him or the aforesaid is not in default in payment of 
government dues or utility charges, including telephone, 
electricity, gas and water charges of an amount in excess of 
Rs10,000 for over six months at the time of filing of nomination 
papers.

According to some reports, the CEC has already obtained a list of 
loan defaulters from the State Bank of Pakistan and utility bills 
defaulters from the respective agencies.

The CEC said the Representation of the People (Amendment) 
Ordinance, 2002, promulgated on July 31, 2002, laid down these 
conditions for acceptance of nomination papers. Besides the 
aforementioned declarations, the candidates will have to state 
their party affiliations and submit a certificate from the 
political party establishing their party candidature from the 
constituency for which nomination papers are to be filed. Moreover, 
a candidate will have to declare that he fulfils the qualification 
specified in Article 62 and is not subject to any of the 
disqualifications specified in Article 63, or any other law for the 
time being in force, for being elected as member.

The candidates will have to submit statements of their assets and 
liabilities and those of their spouses and dependents as on the 
preceding 13th day of June.

Apart from these, the nomination papers should also be accompanied 
by a statement of educational qualifications, occupation, national 
identity card number and national tax number along with attested 
copies of these documents.

The CEC said the nomination forms were being printed and would be 
despatched to all returning officers shortly for onward supply to 
the prospective candidates of national and provincial assemblies' 
constituencies throughout Pakistan on payment of Rs10. These 
nomination forms are also available on the web site of the Election 
Commission - www.ecp.gov.pk.

<a name="pppc">PPP complains to CEC against govt's smear campaign</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 16: The Pakistan People's Party has lodged a 
complaint with the election commission against alleged pre-poll 
rigging and a smear campaign against its leader on the state-owned 
electronic media.

Through a letter, PPP acting secretary-general Raza Rabbani told 
the chief election commissioner (CEC) that the government was 
resorting to systematic pre-poll rigging and an adverse propaganda 
campaign on the electronic media despite his (CEC's) clear 
directives that no such campaign would be launched against any 
political party.

"The party has on a number of occasions pointed out to the election 
commission the use of the civil administration and the offices of 
the governors to further the political agenda of the regime in the 
said elections," he said.

Although the commission had taken note of the same, the regime 
continuously flouted those directives, he said.

Enlisting the incidents of the alleged propaganda campaign against 
the PPP on the electronic media, Mr Rabbani wrote: "On August 11, 
2002, a television show was telecast wherein a serving Maj. Gen 
namely Rashid Qureshi, who is in the service of Pakistan, made 
political comments, levelled false and fabricated charges, 
distorted facts and circumstances and maligned the chairperson of 
Pakistan People's Party with mala fide intent and purpose. The 
false imputation made by Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi amounts to 
influence the ongoing electoral process."

Mr Rabbani demanded of the CEC to take 0appropriate notice of the 
"violations" of the elections commissioner's directives by the 
regime.

<a name="cour">Court notice to AG on Benazir's petition</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 16: A division bench of the Sindh High Court put on 
Friday the attorney-general on notice for Aug 21, when a petition 
of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto challenging the Musharraf 
regime's measure to keep her out of political and electoral process 
came up for pre-admission hearing.

The bench comprised Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed and Justice Ali Aslam 
Jafferi. Ms Bhutto has made the Federation, Chief Election 
Commissioner, Returning Officer NA-207 and NAB Chairman respondents 
in the petition.

Arguing the petition, which was filed by Ms Bhutto's counsel Farooq 
H. Naek, Barrister Kamal Azfar contended that section 8D (2) (n) of 
the CE's order 21 of 2002 was unconstitutional while at the same 
time challenged the vires of section 31 of the NAB Ordinance.

It is the case of the petitioner that the military regime sees in 
the petitioner a threat to its power and is continuing her 
politically-motivated persecution. In this connection, the regime 
passed an absentee law in the shape of Section 31-A by amending the 
NAB Ordinance 1999 and malafidely and unlawfully applied it in the 
aforesaid three courts against the petitioner which is being 
challenged.

It is also her contention that the military regime repealed the 
Political Parties Act and made Political Parties Order 2002 
requiring parties seeking to contest the elections to hold intra-
party elections within a short period which the petitioner's party, 
the PPP, did. The Political Parties Order 2002 also lays down that 
a party leader disqualified from contesting election would be 
refused permission to file application for election symbol with the 
Election Commission.

As soon as the PPP elected the petitioner as party leader the 
regime passed a Benazir-specific amendment to the Chief Executive 
Order 7 of 2002 by way of the Chief Executive Order 21 of 2002 
disqualifying a person from contesting election, if convicted of 
non-appearance in court by the absentee law.

Kamal Azfar claimed that despite harassment and six references, the 
government had not been able to secure conviction of Ms Bhutto.

Barrister Azfar, who represented the petitioner along with Farook 
H. Naek, argued that the basic issue was the question of 
representative democracy in Pakistan: whether the people were 
sovereign to elect their representatives freely or the 
establishment would impose its own malafide solutions.

Ms Bhutto's counsel maintained that there was no question of 
absconcion and termed these amendments Bhutto-specific. He 
submitted that the apex court in Asif Ali Zardari case had quashed 
the conviction and there was no conviction against the petitioner.

Barrister Azfar argued that the Pakistan People's Party's self-
exiled chairperson, Benazir Bhutto, never absconded in terms of 
section 31-A of the NAB Ordinance of 1999, as the petitioner had 
left the country with the permission of the Lahore High Court. 
Thus, no question of disqualification under clause 2 (n) of article 
8D of the CE Order No7 of 2002, as amended, arose

Even otherwise article 8D 2 (n) only applied where a person had 
been convicted of absconcion. Under section 31-A, the guilt was 
determined by operation of law and not as a result of conviction. 
Thus, the disqualification envisaged under article 8D 2 (n) did not 
apply in the case of the petitioner, he submitted.

It is her case that even otherwise section 31-A of the Ordinance of 
1999 only applies where a person absconds to avoid being served 
with any process. The petitioner has not absconded to avoid being 
served with any process.

The petitioner has maintained that the very concept of automatic 
conviction without even a trial is completely subversive of the 
cardinal principle of due process of law and is inconsistent with 
the norms of civility and justice.

It is her contention that article 8D 2 (n) of CEO 7 of 2002, as 
inserted by the CEO No 21 of 2002, is violative of articles 4 and 9 
of the constitution as a person is disqualified from being elected 
to parliament against the doctrine of due process of law and the 
principle of natural justice.

She claims that passing sentence of imprisonment for any term is 
basically a judicial function. Section 31-A of the NAB Ordinance of 
1999 is violative of article 175 of the constitution as it 
interferes with the judicial functions which the courts are 
required to perform in accordance with, inter alia, the CrPC, while 
dealing with cases of absconcion. The legislative fiat reflected by 
section 31-A of the Ordinance of 1999 flouts the independence of 
judiciary.

The petitioner maintains that section 31-A of the Ordinance of 
1999, which automatically convicts a person is violative of 
articles 4 and 9 of the constitution, which guarantee the right of 
every citizen to be dealt with in accordance with law. Conviction 
of a person without any trial whatsoever is a mockery of due 
process of law.

Section 31-A of the Ordinance of 1999 which automatically finds a 
person guilty for reason of absconcion regardless of the individual 
circumstances of each case, is manifestly arbitrary and 
discriminatory.

Article 8D 2 (n) of the CEO 21 of 2002, as amended, is inconsistent 
with articles 63 (h) and (l) of the constitution, which already 
provide for convictions resulting in disqualification of a person. 
This provision also maintains distinction between "guilt" and 
"conviction." Article 63 does not cater for disqualification based 
on section 31-A of the Ordinance of 1999, the petitioner claimed.

Article 8 D 2 (n) of the CEO of 21 of 2002, as amended, is outside 
the parameters of limited power to amend the constitution for the 
welfare of the people which has been circumscribed in Zafar Ali 
Shah's case.

She has therefore prayed for declaring section 31-A of the NAB 
Ordinance of 1999 ultra vires of the provisions of the constitution 
and that it be struck down. She has also prayed for declaring 
article 8D 2 (n) of the CEO 7 of 2002, as inserted vide the CEO 21 
of 2002, inter alia, ultra vires of the provisions of the 
constitution, and that it should be struck down.

Her prayer is also to declare that the petitioner is qualified to 
contest the forthcoming elections, and so the respondents should be 
directed to accept her nomination papers.

KARACHI, Aug 15: The chairperson of Pakistan People's Party, 
Benazir Bhutto, challenged the Musharraf government's attempt to 
keep her out of political and electoral process.

A constitutional petition questioning the legality of amendments to 
section 31 A of the NAB Ordinance and Chief Executive's order 21 of 
2002 was filed in the Sindh High Court on her behalf by Farook 
Naek, advocate.

These amendments pertain to presence of defendants during trial and 
making absentee defendants ineligible to contest the October 
elections. Ms Bhutto's counsel termed these amendments "Bhutto-
specific" and against the constitutional guarantees.

The petition is fixed to come up before a division bench comprising 
Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed and Justice Ali Aslam Jafferi on Friday. 
Ms Bhutto has made the Federation, Chief Election Commissioner and 
Returning officer NA-207 respondent.

"She has been implicated in politically-motivated false cases by 
the Musharraf government," Mr Naek said, adding that "Benazir 
Bhutto has a right to contest the elections and that is why this 
petition has been filed." In view of the government laws, the PPP 
had to launch its Parliamentarians group to remain in contention.

<a name="bena">Benazir ready to work with Nawaz</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: Pakistan's two main opposition parties agreed on 
Thursday to cooperate in October elections. A spokesman for 
Pakistan People's Party said she had given the go-ahead to 
cooperate with Nawaz Sharif's Muslim League (N), for long her arch 
rival.

Farhatullah Babar told Reuters the idea was to make sure the two 
parties, both of whose leaders are barred from contesting the Oct 
10 polls, did not cancel out each other's votes. "That means where 
PML candidates are strong, the PPP will withdraw its candidate and 
vice-versa," Babar said. "It further cements political opposition 
against the government and acts as an impetus for the restoration 
of democracy."

PML spokesman Siddiq-ul-Farooq told Reuters the objective of both 
parties was to defeat military ruler President Pervez Musharraf.

"Though we are traditionally rival parties, I don't rule out 
election adjustment with the PPP on some seats," he said.

The law promulgated by the government effectively excludes both 
Sharif and Bhutto from the running and both are also disqualified 
under a law banning people convicted of crimes.

Benazir has been living in self-imposed exile in London, while 
Nawaz and his family are in exile in Saudi Arabia.

<a name="ands">Benazir and Shahbaz to face law, says minister</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

HYDERABAD, Aug 13: Federal Minister for Law Khalid Ranjha has 
categorically stated that Ms Benazir Bhutto and Shahbaz Sharif 
would be arrested as soon as they arrived in the country and the 
government was not bound to give any special concession to 
facilitate them to go to the relevant court of law directly from 
the airport.

He said that it never happened that an accused was allowed by the 
investigating officer or police to seek pre-arrest bail. He said 
that the law would take its own course when they returned to the 
country, and added that normally the accused do not seek pre-arrest 
bails with the help of the police.

He said that it was, however, upto the court to give any relief to 
the accused Benazir Bhutto and Sharif family. He said that a 
convict was disqualified to contest the polls till his sentence was 
set aside by the court.

Mr Ranjha disclosed that the prosecution of the Sharif family would 
be started from where it was left when they signed a deal and opted 
for Saudi Arabia. He said that Benazir Bhutto, the Sharif family, 
and so many other people who had cases pending against them in the 
court had left the country of their own free will and there was no 
ban on their return.

He said that the government was going to introduce only those 
amendments in the Constitution which were inevitable for the 
continuity of the on-going process, adding that the rest of the 
amendments that deal with the provincial autonomy, council of 
common interest, and other issues would be left to the new 
parliament.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: The Supreme Court adjourned hearing an appeal 
filed by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto challenging the 
inclusion of her name in the accountability reference in which it 
is alleged by the prosecution that she made illegal appointments in 
PIA when she was prime minister of the country.

The three-judge bench, comprising Justice Nazim Hussain Siddiqui, 
Justice Qazi Mohammad Farooq and Justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal, 
adjourned the hearing of the case till the third week of September.

Farooq H. Naik, appearing on behalf of Ms Bhutto, requested for 
adjournment on the ground that another counsel of the petitioner, 
Hafeez Lakho, who had been representing her in the accountability 
reference, was on general adjournment and was out of country.

Deputy Attorney General Sardar Aslam, however, did not raise any 
objection on the contention of Ms Bhutto's lawyer.

Ms Bhutto had challenged the inclusion of her name in the Sindh 
High Court. The SHC, however, dismissed her appeal against which 
she filed leave to appeal in the Supreme Court.

<a name="lhcs">LHC seeks order against Shahbaz</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, Aug 16: The Lahore High Court asked a federal law officer 
to produce the government order or notification, if any, barring 
Mian Shahbaz Sharif's entry into Pakistan and adjourned further 
proceedings in a writ petition seeking the Pakistan Muslim League 
leader's unhindered return home to August 20.

Justice Tasadduq Husain Jilani, who would be availing his summer 
vacation next week, referred the petition to the chief justice for 
consideration by another judge.

The petitioner, a PML (Nawaz) worker, says that Shahbaz Sharif has 
a constitutionally-guaranteed right to return home and lead his 
party in the forthcoming electoral contest. His counsel, Advocate 
AK Dogar, vehemently argued in favour of the petition and contended 
that Shahbaz Sharif was exiled against his wish. "If there is a 
deal as claimed by the government, what are its contents and why 
should they not be made public?" he asked.

Deputy Attorney-General Khwaja Saeeduz Zafar, who was present in 
another case, was asked by Justice Jilani whether the issue had 
been agitated before the court previously and, if so, what was the 
outcome.

The DAG said two petitions were filed for publication of the so-
called deal and for cancellation of the citizenship rights of the 
Sharifs. Both were dismissed by the Lahore High Court. In any case, 
he said, the petition was not maintainable in asmuch as the 
petitioner had no locus standi in the presence of Mr Sharif and 
members of his family, one of whom (Hamza Shahbaz) permanently 
resides in Lahore. What if they disown the averments made in the 
petition? the law officer asked. Let the aggrieved party come 
forward, he said.

Mr Dogar said Hamza was too busy looking after the family business 
and it was basically for the party workers to seek their leader's 
return. The petition has the sanction of PML's Punjab chief 
Zulfiqar Ali Khosa. Besides, public interest petitions could be 
filed by any citizen as held by the Supreme Court.

Mr Saeeduz Zafar said the Supreme Court had wider powers than a 
high court. Only petitions for writs of habeas corpus and quo 
warranto can be moved by non-aggrieved persons.

The court asked the law officer to find out whether there was any 
order barring Mr Sharif's entry and adjourned the hearing.

LAHORE, Aug 15: The Lahore High Court was requested on Thursday to 
restrain the government from barring the entry of PML(N) President 
Mian Shahbaz Sharif to Pakistan.

A writ petition filed by a PML(N) primary unit president, Gulzar 
Malik, through Advocate A.K. Dogar said Shahbaz Sharif had a 
constitutionally-guaranteed right to return to Pakistan because his 
exile from the country was unconstitutional. 

He also had a fundamental right to contest the polls, conduct his 
party's election campaign and form a government of if it won.

The petition said Islam does not recognize forcible seizure of 
power or the law of necessity nor does it empower the judiciary to 
uphold or validate either. This aspect of the 1999 military 
takeover was not decided by the Supreme Court in the Zafar Ali Shah 
case.

Pending the disposal of his petition, the petitioner sought an 
interim declaration in favour of the PML(N) leader's return and 
participation in the electoral process.

<a name="shar">Sharif family won't be allowed to return: ISPR</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 10: Inter-Services Public Relations director-general 
and government spokesman Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi said that the 
government will not allow any member of the Sharif family to 
return.

Speaking in the Pakistan Television program "Encounter", he said 
there was no doubt that the Sharif family could not return to the 
country before the lapse 10 years.

He said the Sharif family went outside the country on its own 
request and under an arrangement. The Saudi government, which was a 
party to the deal, would also not allow them to leave its land, he 
said. The decision to send the family to exile was taken in the 
national interest, he claimed.

Gen Qureshi said Pakistan Muslim League and its chairman, Raja 
Zafarul Haq, were not even aware when the Sharif family was leaving 
the country.

The family held talks with the government for a deal for a long 
time and Kulsoom Nawaz was holding meetings while carrying out 
negotiations for an arrangement to get out of the country, he said.

He said that due to sensitive nature of the deal, the government 
could not divulge its details. However, in the future, the 
government might come up with aspects of the deal, he said.

The family had signed some papers to conclude the deal, he said.

He said people should remember that former prime minister Nawaz 
Sharif had an aeroplane case against him and the punishment awarded 
by the courts to him stood valid. He said there were also many 
other cases of loot and plunder against the Sharif family.

He said former prime minister Benazir Bhutto would have to face 
cases if she decided to return.

Replying to a question, he said Ms Bhutto had fled the country to 
evade corruption cases before the government took over. 

At least 12 cases of loot and plunder were pending against her and 
her husband Asif Ali Zardari, he said. He said a court had 
convicted Benazir Bhutto for absconding from the law.

He claimed that the people did not want Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz

commit corruption.

He said President Gen Pervez Musharraf did not believe in personal 
agenda.-APP

ISLAMABAD, Aug 11: Human Rights Cell of Pakistan People's Party in 
a letter to the Secretary-General of Commonwealth Don McKinnon has 
apprised him of the government's measures to prevent Benazir Bhutto 
from contesting the elections.

The letter, written by Central Coordinator of the cell, Fauzia 
Wahab, enlisted five ordinances promulgated by the military which 
she said were aimed at sidelining Ms Bhutto.

"The PPP being a responsible political party fulfilled all the 
cumbersome requirement under the new laws, the regime, however, has 
come out with another trick to create hurdles and that is the re-
allocation of the election symbol. It had asked the political 
parties to submit their application for election symbol," she said. 
"We apprehend that the EC would again change our symbol and create 
hurdles for our voters," she stated.

<a name="govt">Govt flayed for 'pre-poll rigging'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 10: Pakistan Awami Tehrik (PAT) chairman Tahirul 
Qadri has said that the upcoming general elections will most likely 
be engineered in view of the fact that the government has already 
started "pre-poll rigging" by not allowing political parties to 
start election campaigns.

He was talking to reporters at the party's office here after his 
meeting with the chief of European Union team of election 
observers, John Cushnahan.

"It looks as if the present military government has become a party 
and is using all the state resources to monopolise the results of 
the upcoming general election," he said.

He pointed out that with less than two months to go, the government 
was yet to lift the ban on political activities. Lifting the ban is 
a must for impartial elections, he maintained. "Until people are 
not aware of the true picture of the country's political scene, 
they will not be able to elect true leaders to the elected 
institutions," he remarked.

Election rigging is not just restricted to the polling day only, Mr 
Qadri said and added: "It rather starts with the announcement of 
general election when unwanted political parties are subjected to 
certain calculated obstacles." Commenting on his meeting with Mr 
Cushnahan, the PAT chief said that like other political parties, 
the PAT had also shared its apprehensions with the EU 
representative.

Asked if he was in favour of EU interference in the election 
process, he said there was no harm if somebody wanted to observe 
the election process.

In response to a question, Mr Tahir expressed his regrets over his 
party's support to the referendum to allow President Gen Pervez 
Musharraf another five-year term as president.

The PAT was of the view that reforms started by the military 
government would bring about a positive change, hence it had 
decided to support Gen Musharraf, he said. But to PAT's utter 
disappointment, the present military government followed in the 
footsteps of its predecessors in working on an agenda to prolong 
its tenure rather than mitigate the sufferings of general public, 
he added.

<a name="imra">Imran opposes return of Benazir, Nawaz </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

KHAIRPUR, Aug 13: The Chairman, Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf, Imran 
Khan, has said that the economic conditions of the country are 
critical and asked what impression the PML and PPP are trying to 
create by demanding the return of Nawaz Sharif and Ms Benazir 
Bhutto.

He said that the two former rulers took loans and looted the 
national exchequer worth millions of rupees, and added that how 
they could be allowed to come back and lead the nation.

He said that to the best of his knowledge, the government was not 
hammering out any deal for the return of Nawaz Sharif and Ms 
Benazir and such news were creating the wrong impression in the 
minds of the general public.

He supported the reforms saying that the educational and judicial 
systems should be improved.

He observed that in a country where the judicial system was 
powerful, there would be no political crisis.

He suggested a national council consisting of retired judges, 
lawyers, journalists, intellectuals, and other responsible people 
for the accountability of the whole system.

Mr Imran said that successive elected governments had been 
providing an opportunity to the army to take over by creating a 
crisis-like situation in the country where the army was left with 
no other option.

Talking about the elections, he said he was sure that the elections 
would be held as per schedule and there was no reason for its 
delay.

Defending the reason for supporting the referendum of President 
Pervez Musharraf, Mr Imran said that there had been a meeting of 
political parties where all had agreed to support the referendum, 
but later some of them backed out.

<a name="vows">Imran vows to ensure justice and self-respect</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Habib Khan Ghori

KARACHI, Aug 11: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan kicked 
off his election campaign by announcing three main points of his 
party's election manifesto - provision of justice, promotion of 
human values and ensuring self-respect.

Addressing a public rally at Nishtar Park he said that he was 
launching his election campaign from Karachi as the city had always 
remained a centre of politics and democracy and any movement which 
began from the metropolis had soon taken the country into its grip. 
But he lamented that from the last few years this role had been 
denied to the city, which is a mini- Pakistan.

He recalled that in the past, the two main parties which remained 
in power one after the other had failed to implement their election 
manifestos because of lack of determination. But, Imran Khan said, 
for the last 25 years the nation had remained aware of his role as 
whatever he had promised he had honoured his commitments.

Imran Khan said he had derived the three points from Islam and 
added that the country could not be put to progress unless we are 
prepared to do justice with its ideology for turning Pakistan into 
a welfare Islamic state.

He said that all our crises were a result of our failure to do 
justice with our people. He said in our country only the weaker 
section of society was being made a victim of all repression and 
oppression while the powerful enjoyed immunity even after 
plundering the nation's wealth.

In this connection, he referred to a report published in Dawn, in 
which names along with cheque numbers of those who had benefited 
from Rs500 crores of the Mehran Bank were published. He said these 
people were again in the field to contest the elections. The case 
of plundering the wealth has been pending in the court and was not 
being proceeded because of the influence of those involved in 
corruption, he maintained.

He pledged that his party would never involve in politics of power 
and would not make alliance with any party whose leader had been 
involved in corruption.

"Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf believes in fair and free elections and 
will ensure the election to be conducted by a neutral umpire as I 
was the person who first introduced neutral umpire in the cricket 
world."

He said the government had been trying to reform the system of 
education in religious institutions but was not paying heed to the 
English medium institutions, which had been producing Westernized 
youths devoid of Pakistani spirit.

He said no society could progress without giving due status and 
respect to its teachers, judges and religious scholars.

Spelling out the third point of the manifesto, he said the 
government had been acting on the dictates of the IMF and the World 
Bank and if Allah gave him an opportunity to serve the people, he 
would certainly repay their loans but would not take dictation from 
them.

The others who spoke on the occasion including Mairaj Mohammad 
Khan, Dr Arif Alavi, Zahid Bhurgari, Mir Haider Talpur, Tehmina 
Khattak, Bismillah Khan, Ashraf Quraishi, Fauzia Khan, Tufail Abbas 
and Amanullah Paracha.

<a name="gran">Grand National Alliance formed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter 

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: The Pakistan Muslim League (Q) and the National 
Alliance formed a Grand National Alliance with an understanding to 
contest the October elections on seat-to-seat adjustment basis and 
to jointly work in the future parliament.

"The alliance has been formed to promote stability in the 
democratic process," General Secretary PML(Q) Zafarullah Jamali 
said at a press conference, which was jointly addressed by General 
Secretary of National Alliance Muhammad Ali Durrani.

Though the leaders of the two pro-government political groups 
agreed after overnight consultation on forming the alliance, the 
issue as to who would head this new conglomerate remained 
unresolved.

A brief statement made by the two general secretaries made no 
mention of the office-bearers of this alliance, which would go 
beyond elections.

The parliamentary party to be formed after the elections would 
settle the issue of leadership by electing any one from amongst 
themselves to lead the alliance.

A plain and straight "no" was the reply of Mir Zafarullah Jamali 
when anxious reporters shouted question whether they had elected 
any chairman or president of this alliance.

A brief meeting between the leaders of PML(Q) and the National 
Alliance, which lasted for less than half an hour, was held at a 
local five-star hotel, prior to the formal announcement of the 
alliance.

Former president Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari, President of National 
Awami Party Ajmal Khattak, former prime minister and head of 
National People's Party Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi and Muhammad Ali 
Durrani represented National Alliance, while Mian Muhammad Azhar, 
Chaudhry Shujaat and Ghulam Sarwar Cheema represented PML(Q) at the 
talks.

The idea of forming a grand alliance among the pro-government 
parties had been under consideration since the formation of 
National Alliance. However the agreement on Monday was reached 
after behind-the-scenes deliberations that had been going on for 
the last 24 hours.

The GNA would also contact other parties to make seat adjustments 
with the alliance, Mr Durrani said. On a question whether GNA 
component parties would contest elections under one symbol, Mr 
Durrani said that NA and PML(Q) had already applied separately for 
the election symbols and would contest election under their 
respective symbols.

"The alliance has been formed keeping in the view the bitter 
experiences of the past," Mir Zafarullah Jamali said. He brushed 
aside reports that the alliance had been cobbled together by the 
invisible forces which had also formed the Islamic Jamhori Ittehad 
(IJI) in 1999.

"We have reached broader understanding. Actual adjustment would be 
done later," a NA source said.

The source disclosed that a delegation of GNA would proceed to 
Peshawar on Tuesday to hold negotiations with Aftab Ahmed Khan 
Sherpao on extending seat-to-seat adjustment.

In the provinces of Sindh, the Sindh Democratic Alliance and Ghinwa 
Bhutto have already been part of the alliance.

Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: Makhdoom Amin Fahim, chairman of People's 
Parliamentarians Group (PPG), held a meeting with Jamaat-i-Islami 
chief Qazi Hussain Ahmed at the latter's office and the two reached 
a consensus on creating an atmosphere of national reconciliation. 

Both declared that they had agreed to protect the 1973 constitution 
against amendments and to create an atmosphere of democratic 
reconciliation on the basis of fundamental rights and objective 
resolution.

They, however, denied that they had discussed seat adjustments in 
the coming polls in their hour-long meeting.

Talking to newsmen, Makhdoom said our decision to create a new 
entity was to ensure that we were not thrown out of the election 
process. "We have submitted our registration papers, etc., with the 
Election Commission today," he added. He said his group had applied 
for the symbol of "arrow" and it was now up to the EC to decide.

Replying to a question about his party's future relations with the 
army, Makhdom said: "We want the army to have an honorable exit, 
resume its original work and let the politicians run the country's 
business."

Qazi Hussain Ahmed said: "We both have agreed that we must work 
together to protect the 1973 constitution against any amendments by 
an individual and to create a truly democratic atmosphere conducive 
to the conduct of free, fair and independent elections."

He reiterated his party's demand that the Election Commission be 
reconstituted and an undisputed personality brought in in place of 
Irshad Hasan Khan.

Makhdoom Fahim said nothing was final in politics and "we can take 
joint steps in a number of areas in the future."

When a questioner made reference to mistakes committed by the party 
in the past, the PPG leader said: "Let us bury our past and take a 
new start, with a determination not to repeat the mistakes which 
had resulted in military takeover."

To a question whether his party had pardoned the blood of its 
workers shed during the PPP government, Qazi said: "It was a matter 
to be decided by the court where it was pending."

The JI chief said that "we have agreed in our discussion that 
taking out processions and staging sit-ins were democratic rights 
of the people and there must not be any use of force against such 
demonstrations in the future."

<a name="shct">SHC to hear Omar's appeal in Karachi</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 13: The appeal of Ahmad Omar Saeed Shaikh against the 
death sentence awarded to him in the Daniel Pearl kidnapping/murder 
case by an anti-terrorism court was admitted on Tuesday for regular 
hearing in Karachi by a division bench of the Sindh High Court.

The bench, comprising Justice Roshan Essani and Justice Mujeebullah 
Siddiqui, announced this when the appeal of Omar, filed by Abdul 
Waheed Katpar, came up for pre-admission hearing. Mr Katpar and 
Mohsin Imam advocates were present for the convicted appellant, 
whereas Sindh Advocate-General Raja Qureshi represented the State.

Similar orders were also passed on the appeals of the three 
accomplices of Omar against life terms awarded to them by the ATC, 
and on the State's appeal for enhancement in their sentences.

On July 15 the Special Judge in Hyderabad had awarded death penalty 
to the British-born Omar, whereas his three accomplices - Fahad 
Nasim, Syed Salman Saqib and Shaikh Mohammad Adil - were given life 
terms. Their appeal was filed by Rai Bashir Advocate.

On Mr Katpar's plea for hearing in Karachi, the advocate- general 
had contended that the Supreme Court had directed the matter to be 
heard in Hyderabad. However, Mr Katpar sought refuge in clause 7 of 
the notification of the SHC, dated February 19, according to which 
appeals, revision applications and miscellaneous applications, 
arising out of or involving a sentence of death, shall be heard at 
the principal seat of the SHC.

Justice Essani, however, observed that another bench had already 
decided that all appeals would be heard in Karachi. The court was 
of the view that contents of the memo of appeal required 
consideration and the parties should be put on notice.

Mr Katpar has claimed his client's total innocence in the memo of 
appeal. He claimed that the impugned "judgment is against law and 
facts" and, therefore, should be set aside.

Counsel for the three co-accused claimed that the trial court had 
adopted "pick and choose" method and had considered only those 
points "which were favourable to the prosecution."

The counsel has contended that neither the complainant, Marriane 
Pearl (widow of Daniel Pearl) nor any other witness appeared before 
the trial court to prove the contents of the FIR and signature of 
the complainant on it.

The State was first to file appeal for enhancement of sentence of 
the co-accused, who were convicted and sentenced under section 7 of 
the anti-terrorism act 1997 to suffer imprisonment for life.

Being aggrieved and dissatisfied with the judgment, Raja Qureshi 
had claimed that "overwhelming incriminating evidence has actually 
come on record" in respect of the three persons who have been 
awarded a lesser punishment than what is prescribed by law being 
normal punishment.

It is the contention of the State that the case set up by the 
prosecution was and is based on the conspiracy hatched by the four 
accused, in furtherance of which they committed separate acts with 
the common intention as well as with a meeting of minds, falling 
within the concept of criminal conspiracy. "Hence the accused would 
not in any manner deserve a punishment lesser to what has been 
awarded to the principal accused."

With consent of the parties, the matter was adjourned to a date-in-
office.

<a name="sear">Search for Al Qaeda men launched </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Musaddiq Ali

MANSEHRA, Aug 13: A search operation was launched in the tribal 
belt of Kala Dhaka by the law enforcement agencies for Al Qaeda men 
on the directives of the interior ministry.

The police in the district are on alert and the doctors and 
paramedical staff at the hospitals have been asked to remain on 
duty round the clock to meet any emergency.

Heavily armed contingents of the frontier constabulary have 
encircled the tribal belt along the Indus River and reports 
reaching here reveal that the tribesmen have blocked the Dour Maira 
road, connecting the area with Mansehra district.

It is learnt that 22 Al Qaeda suspects arrested in Peshawar have 
disclosed that they have their hideouts in Kala Dhaka where some of 
their companions are getting training.

A police officer said a sensitive agency had found clues that some 
suspects involved in attacks in different parts of the country had 
taken shelter in the tribal belt.

When contacted, Mansehra District Nazim Mohammad Azam Khan Swati 
said the NWFP governor had phoned him on Sunday night and asked him 
to make vehicles and logistics arrangement for the paramilitary 
troops carrying out the operation. He said the governor had 
received a fax message from the interior ministry on Sunday in this 
regard.

Asked if he was taken into confidence about the operation, Azam 
Swati said the matter was sensitive so it had been kept secret and 
the operation was being carried on the directives of the federal 
government.

Replying to another question, he said he did not know whether the 
officials of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation or 
any other foreign agency were helping the troops in the operation.

The police on Aug 9 raided a house here in Ghazikot township, 
arrested 10 people and took into possession a jeep (RIP-8144), but 
they proved their identity as officers of a secret agency and were 
released. The officers, according to a source in the police, were 
on a mission for tracking the Al Qaeda men in Kala Dhaka. Senior 
superintendent and deputy superintendent of Mansehra police were 
not available for comments.

Sources said the FC troops had taken positions along the Indus and 
were facing difficulty in making advance as the tribesmen had 
blocked the Dour Maira Road. They said the situation was tense.

The Kala Dhaka area has a population of 300,000, mostly comprising 
theBassi Khel, Mada Khel, Nusrat Khel, Akazia and Hassanzai tribes. 
The area borders Mansehra, Buner, Swat, Mardan, Batagram and 
Haripur districts. The sources said the entry points of the area 
had been kept under strict surveillance by the law enforcement 
agencies to check the movement of the suspects.

<a name="defe">Defence closes evidence today: Meerwala case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Nadeem Saeed

MULTAN, Aug 16: The defence in Meerwala gang-rape case has assured 
Dera Ghazi Khan anti-terrorism court that it will complete series 
of its witnesses today (Saturday).

When the ATC reassembled on Friday to take up the case being tried 
in-camera on day-to-day basis, Jatoi police station in-charge 
Inspector Abdul Lateef Chandia told the court that Fayyaz Husain of 
Meerwala could not be traced out. He said the notables of the area 
had told the police that he (Fayyaz) had been missing since the 
registration of the case on June 30 last.

The court on Aug 10 summoned Fayyaz Husain to appear as a defence 
witness on Aug 15 on the request of defence counsel Malik Muhammad 
Saleem. He was supposed to record his statement as a witness to the 
alleged nikah of Mukhtaran Mai with accused Abdul Khaliq.

Moreover, the defence had also pleaded that he was the accused 
named by the complainants but the police had arrested and were 
prosecuting one Fayyaz Husain of Rampur village. The arrested 
Fayyaz had no relationship with the accused while the other Fayyaz 
was the first cousin of main accused Abdul Khaliq.

Fayyaz did not appear in the court on Aug 15 and the police told 
the court that he was missing. At this, the court had issued his 
non-bailable warrants for Aug 16. The police had also informed the 
court that Fayyaz was wanted in a case registered by Alipur police 
station under section 337 PPC on Feb 16, 2002. The court had sought 
the record of the case as well on Thursday.

The record of the case that was produced before the court on Friday 
revealed Fayyaz was on bail in the Alipur case and trial of the 
case would be initiated for the first time on Sept 16, 2002, by an 
area court. While reissuing warrants of Fayyaz, the court directed 
the police to contact the guarantors of Fayyaz in the Alipur case 
to ensure his availability.

The other witness of the alleged nikah of Mukhtaran Mai, Ghulam 
Husain was present in the court. However, the prosecution team, 
headed by special public prosecutor Ramzan Khalid Joiya, informed 
the court that they wanted to examine the statements of both the 
witnesses of the alleged nikah once on a same day.

The defence assured the court that it would not use delaying 
tactics and would complete its series of witnesses on Saturday even 
if the police failed to serve the court notice on Fayyaz.

Sub-Inspector Shabbir Kithran of the Jatoi police station was 
present in the court on Friday. It may be recalled the court had 
issued his bailable warrants for not coming to the court on 
Thursday. He was assigned the duty of serving court notice on 
Fayyaz Husain.

The court also issued bailable warrants of Jatoi's local daily's 
correspondent Mureed Abbas. He was summoned on Friday to testify 
non-compliance of the court notice issued to Fayyaz Husain.

The court adjourned proceedings of the case for Saturday.

<a name="more">More defence witnesses depose: Meerwala gang-rape case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

MULTAN, Aug 15: The Muzaffargarh district coordination officer has 
instructed the Alipur branch of the National Bank not to make 
payments through the joint account of Mukhtaran Mai, the Meerwala 
gang-rape victim, and her father without his consent.

This was stated by bank manager Muhammad Younas while deposing 
before the local anti-terrorism court on Thursday as defence 
witness. He was called as witness by the court on the request of 
defence council Malik Saleem in order to give details of the 
account jointly managed by Mukhtaran Mai and her father, Ghulam 
Farid.

The manager said an account was opened in the name of Ghulam Farid 
on July 5, 2002, and a cheque for Rs500,000 issued by the 
President's Secretariat was deposited by him on July 10. Another 
cheque issued by a local public school was also deposited by the 
account holder on July 15, he said. In the meanwhile, a joint 
account in the name of Ghulam Farid and Mukhtaran Mai was also 
opened in the same branch and Rs500,000 were transferred to this 
account from the account of Farid. He said Rs30,000 and Rs15,000 
had been withdrawn from the account of Farid on July 15 and Aug 12, 
respectively.

He said the joint account was opened on the directions of the 
Muzaffargarh DCO who had instructed the bank that no payment should 
be made through the joint account without his consent as Mukhtaran 
Mai had announced that she would open a school with this grant.

The defence called the bank official because the victim had deposed 
before the court that she had not received even a single penny from 
anybody and that she had donated the presidential grant of Rs0.5m 
for the construction of a school in the area.

Dawn's correspondent Nadeem Saeed deposed his statement as defence 
witness two. He said he visited Meerwala on July 11 last and the 
victim's brother, Hazoor Bakhsh, told him that the police had 
arrested one Fayyaz Husain of Rampur instead of the actual rapist, 
Fayyaz Husain, of Meerwala. Molvi Abdul Razzaq also endorsed the 
statement of Hazoor Bakhsh.

The version of Hazoor Bakhsh was quoted in the story "Police, 
feudals trying to save the chief juror" published in this paper on 
July 12.

On cross-examination by the prosecutors, the DW2 said neither he 
knew Hazoor Bakhsh and Molvi Razzaq before July 11 nor they showed 
their identity cards to him to prove their identities. He said 
Abdul Shakoor, the younger brother of the gang-rape victim, 
introduced Hazoor Bakhsh to him as his elder brother. He said he 
had recognized Shakoor easily because of his pictures published in 
newspapers. Defence counsel Malik Saleem objected to the 
prosecution query about the version of the accused published in the 
July 12 story regarding the Meerwala incident. At this, the court 
advised the defence counsel to refrain from frequent interruptions.

Replying to another query, the DW2 said he could not get official 
response to the Hazoor Bakhsh's claim regarding the arrest of 
accused Fayyaz on the same day. However, on July 15 he succeeded to 
contact Dera Ghazi Khan range DIG Asif Nawaz who expressed a 
surprise over the complainants' accusation, saying the police 
produced the accused before them while recording their 
(complainants) statements under Section 164 CrPC and that they duly 
recognized all of them, including Fayyaz.

He denied that his late father, Mustafa Saeed, had friendship with 
defence counsel Malik Saleem and that the latter convinced him to 
appear before the court as witness. He said he was only complying 
with the court orders. He admitted that one of the defence counsel, 
Muhammad Yaqoob Khan, was his friend and that he provided him the 
unattested copies of the day-to-day proceedings of the in-camera 
trial of the Meerwala case.

Jatoi police station muharrar head-constable Akbar Ali deposed 
before the court as DW3. He said no case was registered against 
Molvi Razzaq during the last Muharram on the basis of information 
that he had links with the banned Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan.

A sub-inspector of the Muzaffargarh city police station, Muhammad 
Ashraf, while recording his statement as DW4 admitted that he 
brought out Fayyaz Husain from jail on July 14 last for 
interrogation in a case registered under sections 380 and 458 PPC. 
The case was registered against unidentified accused on Feb 10, 
2002. He denied that he was directed by the authorities to replace 
the arrested Fayyaz with the actual accused. He admitted that no 
accused had so far been challaned in the case. He said Fayyaz was 
again sent to jail after two days of interrogation when his 
involvement in the case could not be established.

Earlier, when judge Malik Zulfiqar Ali resumed the trial of the 
case, the defence counsel informed the court that they wanted to 
give-up Muzaffargarh district Nazim Sultan Hinjra to appear as DW. 
The court granted them the permission.

It may be noted that Sultan Hinjra was summoned by the court on 
Saturday last on the request of the defence to clarify his 
interview published in a local Urdu daily on Aug 12 last in which 
he was quoted to have said that women had never come up to the 
panchayats to seek pardon.

It is learnt that the district Nazim reportedly denied outside the 
court on Thursday that he had even given any such interview. At 
this the defence thought it better to give-up him as DW. Earlier, 
Hinjra had appeared as court witness (CW1) in the Meerwala case.

Jatoi SHO Abdul Latif Chandia informed the court that Fayyaz Husain 
of Meerwala could not be traced to serve him the court notice to 
appear as defence witness to testify that a 'nikah' was actually 
solemnized between Abdul Khaliq and Mukhtaran Mai. Fayyaz of 
Meerwala is a cousin of Khaliq, and the defence was pleading that 
he had been replaced with Fayyaz being prosecuted wrongly. The 
court issued non-bailable warrants for Fayyaz Husain for Aug 16.

The other 'witness' of the 'nikah' was present in the court but the 
prosecution refused to cross-examine him separately. At this, the

<a name="atcs">ATC summons six more witnesses: Meerwala gang-rape</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

MULTAN, Aug 10: Dera Ghazi Khan anti-terrorism court's judge Malik 
Zulfiqar Ali summoned three more court witnesses and as many 
defence witnesses in the under-trial Meerwala gang-rape case.

Those summoned as CWs are Muzaffargarh district Nazim Sultan 
Mahmood Hinjra, Dawn correspondent Nadeem Saeed and Jatoi police 
station's Sub-Inspector Ashraf. Sultan Hinjra had already appeared 
before the Dera ATC as CW1 in the case.

Among the summoned DWs are Jatoi police station's Muharrar, accused 
Abdul Khaliq Mastoi's maternal uncle Ghulam Husain and his paternal 
cousin Fayyaz Husain. Both the CWs and the DWs have been called on 
the request of the defence.

Sultan Hinjra (CW1) has been recalled in connection with his 
interview published in a local Urdu daily on Aug 2 last in which he 
claimed the women had never turned up to the Panchayats under the 
local traditions to seek pardon.

This correspondent has been summoned to verify one of his 
dispatches published in Dawn on July 12 last under the caption 
'police, feudal trying to save chief juror'.

Quoting gang-rape victim's brother Hazoor Bakhsh, the report said 
the police had arrested one Fayyaz Husain of Dunni (Rampur village) 
instead of actual rapist Fayyaz Husain of Meerwala.

Sub-Inspector Ashraf has reportedly been called to explain why the 
arrested Fayyaz was brought out of the jail on July 14 last on two-
day remand in police custody in a case registered on Feb 10 last 
under section 458 and 380 against some unidentified people.

The Muharrar of the Jatoi police station would bring with him an 
alleged report recorded against Maulvi Abdul Razzaq (PW) on March 
26 last during Muharram for the latter's alleged link with the 
banned Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan.

While DWs, Ghulam Husain and Fayyaz Husain, have been called 
because the defence in the Meerwala case has claimed that they were 
the witnesses to the Sharae Nikah of Mukhtaran bibi and accused 
Abdul Khaliq.

All the CWs and DWs have been directed to appear before the court 
on Aug 15 (Thursday).

<a name="lash">Lashkar-i-Jhangvi blamed for attacks </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: The government identified the outlawed militant 
network Lashkar-i-Jhangvi as the group suspected of launching two 
attacks on Christian targets last week in which 11 people died.

"We strongly suspect the attackers to be part of Lashkar-i-Jhangvi, 
one of its main factions," interior ministry spokesman Iftikhar 
Ahmed told AFP. "There are strong connections between those two 
attacks."

Lashkar-i-Jhangvi has also been linked to the suicide car-bomb 
attacks in Karachi outside the Sheraton hotel in May and the US 
consulate in June, and the murder of abducted US journalist Daniel 
Pearl this year.

Police have detained "six or seven" people for questioning over 
Friday's grenade attack on the Christian Hospital chapel in Taxila, 
25km from Islamabad, he said. "They've made different arrests, not 
of the culprits, but rather their associates," the spokesman said.-

<a name="bann">Banned groups behind attack</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 11: Pakistani investigators said that the three men 
behind Friday's grenade attack on a hospital chapel were believed 
to belong one of two banned Islamic militant groups.

One of the three died in the attack, in which grenades were lobbed 
into a crowd of women filing out of a Presbyterian chapel, killing 
three nurses and injuring dozens more.

"After identifying the accused who was killed in the attack, we 
have information that the attackers were members either of the 
banned Jaish-i-Mohammad or Harkat-ul-Mujahideen groups," Rawalpindi 
District Mayor Tariq Kiani told Reuters. "Or they may be members of 
splinter or breakaway groups of these banned outfits," he said. "We 
believe we will track down the remaining two...we are pretty sure 
we will arrest them."

On Monday, three men raided a Protestant missionary school for 
foreign students in Murree killing six Pakistanis. The three later 
blew themselves up after being challenged by police.

Investigators said an autopsy on the attacker who died on Friday 
showed he was hit by a piece of shrapnel from a grenade.

Kiani identified the killed attacker as Kamran Butt, a resident of 
Rawalpindi. "The police are questioning his friends and relatives 
to find more details so as to reach the remaining two attackers." 
An officer said Butt had fought alongside mujahideen in occupied 
Kashmir.-Reuters

<a name="watt">Wattoo seeks release in pending reference</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 15: Former chief minister Manzoor Wattoo submitted an 
application before an accountability court for his release in a 
corruption reference pending for adjudication. The court issued 
notice to the NAB on the application for Aug 17.

Wattoo in his application pleaded that he had been acquitted in two 
NAB references by the Lahore High Court last week and he was still 
in NAB detention at the Punjab Institute of Cardiology.

He stated he had been implicated as co-accused along with former 
provincial food minister Tikka Muhammad Iqbal in a corruption 
reference filed before the accountability court in March 2001.

He claimed he had not been formally arrested by police on the 
charges levelled in the reference, and he was simply being summoned 
by the court as a co-accused. He offered to furnish surety bonds 
with the court as a token of guarantee for not absconding the court 
proceedings following his release.

In the reference, Tikka along with the former chief minister has 
been held accused of causing a Rs44.7 million loss to the national 
exchequer.

According to the prosecution, Tikka in connivance with Wattoo 
forced the Food Department to purchase 3,000 bales of jute bags 
worth Rs29.2 million following the expiry of procurement season.

It has been alleged in the reference that the payment of Rs29.2 
million resulted in a six-month delay in repayment of loans to 
banks and the Food Department had to pay an interest of Rs22.2 
million.

The investigations further revealed that the jute bags were 
purchased at an excessive rate of Rs2.50 per bag for which an 
additional payment of Rs22.50 million had to be made to the mills 
owner bringing the quantum of total loss to Rs44.7 million.

Tikka has already been allowed by the LHC to leave for the US for 
medical treatment.

<a name="nodi">No disqualification on me: Wattoo</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 11: Former Punjab chief minister Manzoor Ahmed Wattoo 
claimed that there was no disqualification imposed on him for 
contesting next general elections.

Talking to Dawn, Mr Wattoo said he did not accept the 10-year 
disqualification for contesting elections imposed on him by an 
accountability court in June last in three Baitul Maal references.

"The court simply dismissed my application for exemption from 
section 15 (1) of the NAB Ordinance imposing 10-year 
disqualification from contesting elections and did not issue a 
formal order while concluding the case," Mr Wattoo claimed.

According to the former Punjab chief minister, the cases had been 
filed against him under the Ehtesab Act 1997 which did not 
prescribe any disqualification for an accused striking a plea 
bargain deal. 

He alleged the three references were outcome of a grudge which Mian 
Nawaz Sharif had against him. "I did not move an application for 
plea bargain in these three references because I did not misuse 
Baitul Maal funds," he claimed.

He said the other five accused had deposited Rs10.07 million with 
the NAB and had moved an application for plea bargain.

Replying to a query, former Punjab chief minister acknowledged that 
he should have moved an application for his pre-mature acquittal 
before the accountability court instead of pleading for his 
exemption from Section 15.

Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 10: Two accountability courts issued formal orders for 
former Punjab chief minister Manzoor Wattoo's release from jail 
provided he had not been arrested in any other case.

The orders were issued by two trial courts following Mr Wattoo's 
acquittal by the Lahore High Court in two references.

In the reference decided by judge Mahmood Akhtar Siddiqui on Jan 6, 
2001, Mr Wattoo had been awarded three years rigorous imprisonment 
and fined Rs10 million for misusing his authority as chief 
minister. He had been charged with paying without legal authority 
Rs1,061,125 to a firm, Messers Design Tex.

In the reference decided by judge Rafique Goreja on Apr 4, 2000, he 
was sentenced to four years rigorous imprisonment and fined Rs4 
million. In this reference he had been charged with having issued 
110 plot allotment orders in housing schemes of the Lahore 
Development Authority on the last date of his tenure as chief 
minister. The prosecution alleged that 63 of these plots were 
allotted without formal applications.

<a name="amer">American school may be closed down</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: The administration of American International 
School has threatened to close down its institution, if the 
government fails to provide adequate security cover in the wake of 
recent terrorist attacks, an official source said.

The school administration held a session with the Interior Minister 
Moinuddin Haider on Tuesday and apprised him of their security 
concerns.

Shortly after the meeting, the chief commissioner and inspector 
general of police Islamabad went to the school and assured the 
administration that they should not worry as the police were taking 
all possible measures for their security.

The source said the school staff who was expected to return on 
August 15 have deferred their arrival for an indefinite period.

The school management held a meeting with the interior minister on 
Tuesday and expressed their security concerns.

The source said in view of the security concern shown by the 
American School administration 'Black Tiger' police squad had been 
formed and deployed at the school. The well-equipped squad will be 
stationed in the school building and also escort the school van 
during pick and drop service, the source said.

When a senior police official of Islamabad Capital Territory police 
was contacted, he confirmed the formation of Black Tiger squad and 
said that it was formed after the terrorist threat.

In another move, the secretary interior has sought explanation from 
the chief of Islamabad police (IGP) about allegations of 
misbehaviour and indifference of the police officials towards 
foreigners seeking security cover, the source said. The interior 
secretary's move came after a diplomat complained that neither the 
capital police IGP nor the SSP responded when he expressed his 
security concerns and asked the police to take effective security 
measures, a source in the interior ministry said.

When a senior police officer was contacted, he confirmed that 
complaint had been lodged and the police had responded. 
"Unfortunately, the reply was missed somewhere in the mail".

Diplomats in Islamabad have been advised to refrain fromgoing to 
deserted places and offered to take police guards, if they so 
desire for their protection, following the recent attacks in Murree 
and Taxila.

<a name="seve">Several groups vying to be king of country's financial sector</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Dilawar Hussain

KARACHI, Aug 13: First Leasing Corporation Limited told the stock 
exchange that three nominee directors of Pak Libya Holding Company 
had been replaced by nominees of the Crescent group.

The decision of the Board taken at the meeting on Monday, went to 
confirm the July 23 report by Dawn that the Cres Group had 
purchased strategic equity interests held by Pak-Libya Holdings 
Limited in two leasing companies - First Leasing Corporation and 
Paramount Leasing Company for cash consideration of Rs175 million. 
Probably unaware of the undercurrents, the local management of 
First Leasing had expressed ignorance about the transaction to an 
earlier query by the stock exchange. Paramount Leasing had said 
that the matter was under discussion.

Dawn has learnt that similar changes on the Board of directors of 
Paramount would be made at the meeting of its board scheduled for 
August 27.

Both publicly traded companies - First Leasing Limited and 
Paramount Leasing Limited - are in advanced talks for merger, which 
would create "First Paramount". Cres Group, is understood to have 
paid Rs5 per share to Pak-Libya for its 36 per cent stake in First 
Leasing, while acquiring the 56 per cent majority holding in 
Paramount Leasing at Rs10 per share. The group would probably be 
able to induct four nominees on the seven-member board of directors 
of Paramount, on August 27. When the proposed merger of Paramount 
with First Leasing is completed, the Crescent group would go to 
hold 52 per cent equity in the merged company - First Paramount 
Leasing Company.

Paid-up capital of First Leasing is Rs272 million and that of 
Paramount Rs250 million, which takes the combined capital of 'First 
Paramount' to Rs522 million - largest among 32 companies listed on 
the leasing sector. Interestingly, over 80 per cent equity in both 
leasing companies was vested in financial institutions, which was 
why acquisition of majority stake looked both an easier and a 
timely strategic move.

At separately held extraordinary general meetings on August 6 at 
Lahore, shareholders in two other listed entities - Altowfeek 
Investment Bank and First Crescent Modaraba gave their approval to 
the scheme of arrangement for amalgamation of the two companies 
into the "First Standard Investment Bank Limited". 

Cres group would hold 35 per cent shares and place three nominees 
on the seven member board of the First Standard Investment Bank 
Limited. The strategy of the Cres group appears to be to combine 
the modaraba, investment bank and the two leasing companies, into a 
kind of financial super market: "Altowfeek Bank" which would hold 
three-quarters of a billion rupees in capital and more than Rs8 
billion in assets. Things appear to be progressing according to 
plans for the group. But in the race to be the biggest in the 
financial sector, there are other equally fierce competitors: PICIC 
and the Mansha group are the two more openly in the race.

Through mergers & acquisitions including aggressive biddings on 
privatization of state-controlled banks, major groups and business 
houses are vying to tower above the rest in the financial sector. 
As regulators push for consolidation by prescribing huge equity 
deadlines, more mergers and takeovers among investment banks, 
modarabas and leasing and insurance companies would be inevitable. 

If the Privatization Commission is able to keep up to its targeted 
sale of UBL, HBL, NIT and ICP before the year is out, it won't be 
too long before the dust settles and from among the various 
contestants, the group that is to be the king of the country's 
financial sector, emerges fully into view.

<a name="hbls">HBL sell-off attracts local, foreign investors</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawaid Bokhari

KARACHI, Aug 10: State-run Habib Bank is a "jewel" that has been 
offered for sale as Dr Ishrat Husain, Governor of State Bank, puts 
it and sources say it has attracted domestic strategic investors as 
well as multilateral agencies, interested in acquiring stakes in 
the bank.

A consortium of leading local businessmen - the Aga Khan 
Foundation, Habib Bank A.G. Zurich and Bestway Holdings Group of 
Abu Dhabi - are among those who have submitted EoIs (Expressions of 
Interest) to the Privatization Commission. The last date for 
submitting EoIs was July 31 and the process of pre-qualification of 
prospective bidders is expected to be completed by August 15.

And outside the formal sale process, World Bank's affiliate 
International Finance Corporation, Asian Development Bank and 
Commonwealth Development Corporation are looking at the bank and 
the proposed deal with an aim at acquiring stakes jointly with the 
winner in the bid. the representatives of these institutions have 
been sounding some of the prospective bidders.

Road shows have also been held for 2-3 possible buyers in the 
Middle East and the UK, which were conducted by HBL president Zakir 
Mahmood and an official of the Privatization Commission.

Whereas Pakistan is currently not a destination for large 
investments from the West required for purchase of HBL, the 
domestic investors have been activated by the restructuring and 
privatization of the financial sector. Some of the locals have 
joined hands with Arab investors.

The entry of Mian Mohammad Mansha, a top textile industrialist into 
banking, his acquisition of MCB and bid for UBL has perhaps 
inspired a group of Karachi businessmen that includes leading 
textile barons Bashir Ali Mohammad and Tabba to bid for Habib Bank. 
They are progressive businessmen, who have been modernizing their 
plants depending more on their own equity rather than bank 
borrowing to face global competition. And they have a track record 
to impress the Privatization Commission. Whether they would be able 
to raise the kind of money that is needed to buy at least 26 per 
cent of the stakes, is the moot question. Their interest in HBL 
also indicates that textile owners are exploring fresh avenues for 
investment, not for new projects but acquisition of running 
enterprises.

Currently, the State Bank is looking at the sources of funds, which 
MCB would use to buy the UBL. If Mian Mansha gets UBL, he would 
benefit from synergies created by the merger of UBL and MCB, and 
the merged unit would also have global reach, which his bank 
currently does not have. Pakistan needs large banks to have a 
presence in the global market and compete with leading foreign 
banks. The merger would lead to cutting of overhead costs, saving 
on closure of competing branches and the merged unit would benefit 
from UBL's foreign subsidiaries, branches and joint ventures. 
Barring a major upset, Mian Mansha would emerge the winner.

Among those who have submitted EoIs for HBL to the Privatization 
Commission is Geneva-based Habib Bank A.G. Zurich, which was 
launched by the owners of the Habib Bank when HBL was nationalized 
by Bhutto's government. As former owners, they would expect that 
the HBL should be returned to them as it was being privatized. The 
right of first refusal was not given to Adamjees in case of MCB 
sell-off. It is unlikely that the government would concede on this 
point. Although some experts believe that the former owners should 
have the first right of refusal if they can match the highest bid.

But not all the bidders would be able to mobilize resources for 
acquiring the kind of money that is required to buy 26-51 per cent 
stakes in the HBL. The government may prefer a buyer acquiring 51 
stakes to the offer made for a mere 26 per cent stakes. Herein 
comes the advantage of the Aga Khan's resources and his 
creditability with the international agencies like IFC and CDC. 
Normally, IFC takes a maximum of 25 per cent stakes in any venture.

How the Bestway group of Abu Dhabi would fare is difficult to 
forecast as was the unpredictable course they took in case of bid 
for UBL. But they do indicate that investors from the Middle East 
are continuing showing interest in acquiring stakes in the 
financial sector. The latest example is the interest of Pak-Kuwait 
to buy IDBP, which has a licence for commercial banking. Sources 
say that the State Bank would like the IDBP to be run as a SME 
bank. Initially, as market reports go, Pak-Kuwait may acquire the 
bank on a two-year management contract.

Muhammad Aslam

The KSE 100-share index attained the coveted level of well over 
1,800 points at 1,815.76 as compared to previous 1,779.40,pushing 
the market capitalization to a respectable figure of Rs423 billion. 
The net rise in the index being 36.36 points or 2.5 percent over 
the week.

After a month of low volumes including a record low of 17m shares 
in a single-session, the turnover figure swelled to a respectable 
total of 95m shares but still below the average daily to total of 
100 million shares in normal trading sessions. 

The buying support was so strong that it breached through the 
circuit breaker, leading the way for other blue chips to follow its 
lead and it was promptly picked up by some others including PSO. 
According to market sources the MCB group led by Mian Muhammad 
Mansha has, over the last two years, cornered about 40 percent of 
its floating stock and is planning for a hostile take-over after 
buying its floating stock.

In an identical hostile take-over bids, its 10.00-rupee share had 
touched the peak level of Rs.105.00 and Rs.70.00 a couple of years 
back as speculator joined to race for capital gains.

Opinions are however still divided over the future market outlook 
but some stock analysts predict the lean period may be over and 
consolidation forces are in to restore credibility to stock 
trading. Next couple of sessions will show how the market behaves.

Plus signs dominated the list,major gainers being Shell Pakistan, 
Century Papers, Clover Pakistan, Kohinoor Weaving, Adamjee 
Insurance, PSO, Pak Reinsurance and Wyeth Pakistan Arif Habib 
Securities, International Industries, Anwar Textiles, Dawood 
Hercules after an interim dividend of 55 percent, Ghani Glass, 
Abbott Lab, Kohinoor Weaving, PSO, Shell Pakistan and several 
others. The largest rise was, however, noted in Wyeth Pakistan, 
which rose by Rs10.00 to 20.00 in each session.

Losers were led by Spencer & Co, Al-Ghazi Tractors, Shafiq Textiles 
and New Jubilee Insurance, Attock Refinery, IGI Insurance, Glaxo-
Wellcome Pakistan, Aventis Pharma, Shell Gas and Nestle MilkPak and 
some others.

Trading volume rose to 238 million shares from the previous weekly 
low level of 163m shares, bulk of which was contributed during the 
last three sessions of the week including 95 million shares on 
Friday.

Hub-Power, PTCL, PSO were leading among the volume leaders and 
accounted for 70 per cent of the total followed by ICI Pakistan, 
MCB, National Bank, Sui Northern, Adamjee Insurance, Engro 
Chemical, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, WorldCall, Pak PTA and several 
others.

FUTURE CONTRACTS: After early weakness, speculative issues on the 
forward counter also rose in sympathy with their counterparts in 
the ready section. PSO was the top performer as gainers, while Hub-
Power topped the list of volume leaders followed by PTCL, ICI 
Pakistan, notably after the announcement of interim profit, MCB and 
Engro Chemical, finishing on-balance steady amid active two-way 
trading.

<a name="wene">We never learn from history-3	</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

The contents of my two previous columns in this series are not 
revelations; they are a narrative of facts on record in our Supreme 
Court and as reported in our press, dating back to 1994, and for 
these past eight years there has been no public refutation of any 
accusation levelled against the politicians who accepted the 
people's money or were involved in one way or another in the 
shenanigans of the ISI.

Now, my friend Roedad Khan, perpetual bureaucrat steeped in the art 
of bureaucracy, yet again ready to serve his country, has reacted 
in a letter printed in this newspaper on July 26. Apparently, his 
innocence has been injured. He denies having had any connection 
with those in President Ghulam Ishaq's secretariat who were paid to 
'fix' the 1991 elections. He has, however, said that though he does 
not wish "to comment on the substance of the matter," he "will do 
so at the appropriate time," which, hopefully, will be soon. His 
secretariat colleague, General Rafaqat, is listed as having 
accepted ISI funds to do the job. So it should seem unlikely that 
the other secretariat members such as Roedad Khan, Ijlal Zaidi and 
Chaudhry Shaukat would not be in the know. (Oddly enough, when last 
month President General Pervez Musharraf met a band of 
'intellectuals' with whom to discuss the coming elections, the 
strategy to be adopted, and the constitutional amendments, these 
four retired members of Ghulam Ishaq's special assignment cell were 
amongst those summoned.)

One other to respond, whose letter was printed on August 8, was 
Kunwar Khalid Yunus of the MQM, who has spent well over two years 
in jail on various occasions during the last decade and who, when 
he is out and about, is the press spokesman for his party. He 
categorically states that the MQM has never received any illegal 
amounts on behalf of its founder and leader, Altaf Hussain. Listed 
amongst the recipients of ISI funds was "Yusuf Haroon, Rs 5 million 
[he confirms having received this for Altaf Hussain of the MQM]" 
which Khalid does not refute. Yusuf, now in Karachi, has 
reconfirmed that he handed over the money to Altaf Hussain at Nine-
zero. Obviously Khalid was not privy to the transaction.

Last week, I was reminded by General Naseerullah Babar that I had 
ommitted certain names from the list of those 'anti-PPP 
politicians' who received payments from the ISI during the run-up 
to the 1990 elections rigged in favour of the IJI and Nawaz Sharif. 
These were: Jamaat-i-Islami Rs 5 million; Altaf Hussain Qureshi and 
Mustafa Sadiq Rs 0.5 million; Arbab Ghulam Aftab Rs 0.3 million; 
Pir Noor Mohammad Shah Rs 0.3 million; Arbab Faiz Mohammad Rs 0.3 
million; Arbab Ghulam Habib Rs 0.2 million; Ismail Rahu Rs 0.2 
million; Liaquat Baloch Rs 1.5 million; Jam Yusuf Rs 0.75 million; 
Nadir Magsi Rs 1 million; Ghulam Ali Nizamani Rs 0.3 million; Ali 
Akbar Nizamani Rs 0.3 million.

Yet more payments: During the Mehrangate investigations of 1993 
which led up to the Supreme Court case, Younas Habib of HBL/MBL, as 
per his statement filed in court (recorded in Karachi under section 
161 Cr.P.C), disclosed that the following political and other pay-
offs were made between 1991 and 1994: "General Mirza Aslam Beg Rs 
140 million; Jam Sadiq Ali (the then chief minister of Sindh) Rs 70 
million; Altaf Hussain (MQM) Rs 20 million, Advocate Yousaf Memon ( 
for disbursement to Javed Hashmi, MNA, and others) Rs.50 million; 
1992 - Jam Sadiq Ali Rs 150 million; 1993 - Liaquat Jatoi Rs .01 
million; 1993 - chief minister of Sindh, through Imtiaz Sheikh Rs 
12 million; Afaq of the MQM Rs 0.5 million; 1993 chief minister of 
Sindh, through Imtiaz Sheikh, Rs. 01. million; 1993 - Ajmal Khan, a 
former federal minister, Rs 1.4 million; 1993 - Nawaz Sharif, 
former prime minister, Rs 3.5 million; 27/9/93 Nawaz Sharif, former 
prime minister, Rs 2.5 million; 26/9/93 Jam Mashooq Rs 0.5 million; 
26/9/93 Dost Mohammad Faizi Rs 1 million; Jam Haider Rs 2 million; 
Jam Mashooq Rs 3 million; Adnan, son of Sartaj Aziz, Rs 1 million; 
Nawaz Sharif and Ittefaq Group of Companies Rs 200 million 
(photocopies of cheques and deposit slips, etc, already attached 
with affidavit at page nos. 42 to 73); Sardar Farooq Leghari 
12/12/93 (payment set/off) Rs 30 million - 6/1/94 Rs 2.0856 million 
- 19/3/94 Rs 1.92 million."

In 1997, in the Supreme Court, during the hearing of Human Rights 
Petitition 19/96 filed by Air Marshal Asghar Khan against the 
illegal distribution of the people's money by the ISI for political 
purposes, and also seeking the post-retirement court martial of 
General Mirza Aslam Beg, accusing him of gross misconduct by 
ignoring while he was chief of staff of the Pakistan Army such 
illegal distributions, Aslam Beg made the following statement: "I 
hereby take oath, and knowing fully well that I am saying this in 
the presence of Allah Almighty and this Honourable Court, submit 
that:

"ISI is Inter-Services Intelligence organization cretaed by the 
government of Pakistan and had been directly answerable/responsible 
to the three Services through JCSC till 1975. In 1975 the then 
prime minister of Pakistan, through an executive order, created a 
political cell within the organization of ISI and by virtue of this 
change in the working of ISI it came directly under the control of 
the chief executive, particularly on political matters and for all 
the security matters concerning the armed forces ISI reported to 
the Joint Chief of Staff Committee. This status continues till 
today. ISI is virtually divided into two parts, one is [the] 
political wing and [the] other concerns matters relating to counter 
and strategic intelligence of the armed forces. During the days of 
Zia martial law, the ISI was reporting in all matters to the 
president, who, by virtue of his office as chief martial law 
administrator and president of Pakistan, controlled its office.

"After the general elections of 1988, ISI was free completely from 
the influence of the army and since then ISI is virtually under the 
control of chief executive while remaining responsible to JCSC. In 
1990 when the money was donated by Younas Habib, ISI was acting 
under the directions of higher authorities. As chief of the army 
staff at that time, when I was informed of this matter my only 
concern was that the money received by the ISI was utilized 
properly and an account was maintained and beyond that I had no 
concern with the money.

"Although the director-general, ISI, is an officer in uniform but 
the chief of army staff has no authority to take action against 
him. The head of ISI was a person from army of which I was head at 
the relevant time."

During the hearing of the Supreme Court case, General Babar filed 
an affidavit recording that Rs.140 million was collected by the 
political cell of the ISI from Younas Habib at the instance of 
General Beg, the then COAS. When the then head of the ISI, Lt 
General Asad Durrani, was approached, he provided certain details 
in an affidavit, but approached the then prime minister, Benazir 
Bhutto, asking her to 'shelve' the case. The affidavit was obtained 
by Rahman Malik of the FIA who was sent to Germany, where Durrani 
was then the Benazir-appointed ambassador, with stamped papers for 
him to sign. In the affidavit, Durrani confirmed that he had 
received instructions from COAS General Beg to provide 'logistic 
support' for the disbursement of donations made by certain 
'businessmen of Karachi' to the IJI election campaign of 1990, and 
was told that the operation had the blessings of the government.

The former attorney-general of Pakistan, Iqbal 'Groovy' Haider, 
representing General Babar in the Supreme Court, informed the court 
that the money was distributed not to political parties but to 
political individuals. It was common knowledge, he said, that the 
ISI was involved in politics. Lt General Hameed Gul, a former ISI 
chief, was on record as having boasted that it was he who created 
the IJI, and another ISI chief, Lt General Javed Nasir, had taken 
credit for creating the MQM Haqiqi.

Air Marshal Asghar Khan's pending petition involving illegal 
payoffs and corruption during the run-up to one of our previous 
elections should be heard now by the Supreme Court before the next 
round of elections. It will then be up to our honourable election 
commission to ensure that if any of the personalities involved in 
the ISI payoff and Mehrangate scandals are filing to stand once 
again for election to our assemblies they are disqualified from so 
doing.

This human rights petition has apparently been consigned to the 
Supreme Court morgue (for whatever reason). The air marshal has 
consistently written to all our successive chief justices of 
Pakistan asking that the case be heard, but nothing has happened. 
The last chief justice to show any interest in hearing the case was 
Sajjad Ali Shah who prematurely retired in December 1997 after 
having lost his battle with prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Since 
then, no chief justice has responded to the air marshal's repeated 
requests. We must hope that the next request that is being made 
this coming week will not be ignored by Chief Justice Sheikh Riaz 
Ahmed, who, in 1994 was the federal law secretary and undoubtedly 
remembers the SROs he issued in this matter.

<a name="bewi">Bewildered: the cavalry under siege</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

The wagons have been drawn into a circle and the cavalry's 
sharpshooters, anxious eyes peering through slit-holes, await with 
beating heart the attack of the Red Indians. We can see the 
dismounted cavalry behind the wagons. But where exactly are the Red 
Indians? Hidden behind which high mountains?

Each passing day reveals in clearer outline a startling paradox: in 
an uncertain situation the only thing certain is the anxiety of a 
befuddled government. A government prone to inventing dangers or 
seeing dangers where none exist. Or which exist only in the 
insecurities of the military mind.

No other explanation suffices for the government's actions in the 
political sphere. Of what is it afraid? What Red Indians is it 
fortifying itself against? The president is all set to be the most 
powerful figure in the new political set-up being designed by his 
various constitutional technicians, chief among them the much 
commented-upon General Naqvi. 

The prime minister will walk in his shadow, having no other choice 
knowing that he will serve at the president's pleasure.

Over the National Assembly will perpetually hang the sword of 
dismissal. Even otherwise that body will be packed with loyalists. 
Somewhere on top will hover the National Security Council, with the 
service chiefs sitting in it, keeping a beady eye on civilian 
goings-on. So what are Pakistan's generals afraid of?

Not to forget another factor, President Musharraf will also keep 
riding his other horse as army chief. This is the ultimate 
guarantee of his security and survival, the one plank against which 
political parties find themselves helpless. And yet even after 
fitting himself with all this armour, General Musharraf seems to be 
walking in dread of the future. At least this is the impression his 
actions betray.

Forget about the extraordinary shroud of security which has come to 
surround his person, the double and triple sets of Mercedes cars in 
which he now usually travels. That is, when he travels at all 
because he has cancelled several travel plans lately out of 
security concerns. These precautions are related to the terrorist 
backlash the country is facing as a result of the war against 
extremist elements. If religious extremists can strike at churches, 
consulates and schools, they will not stop short of hitting other 
targets given half the chance. So it is only natural that the 
president's security should be upgraded.

But the slaughter we are seeing in the constitutional arena has 
nothing to do with jihadi concerns or any war on terror. It is 
related to the terror about the future lurking in the minds of the 
present holders of power. That this is irrational hardly needs 
emphasizing. 

Taking precautions against the followers of Shaikh Omar or any 
jihadi organization is one thing. Taking extraordinary precautions 
against the people of Pakistan is an altogether different matter.

The fear arising from the motives or actions of the jihadi 
organizations can be put in quantifiable terms. There are hard-core 
elements who are terribly upset by Pakistan's collaboration with 
the United States in its war against Al Qaeda and its supporters. 

To vent their anger and undermine the Musharraf government, these 
elements can be expected to do anything. This is a tangible threat 
and to meet it tangible precautions can be taken. Hence, among a 
whole range of other measures, the heightened security around the 
president's person. But the fear consuming the military government 
regarding the future and the uncertainties of the political process 
is harder to define because it is a form of paranoia. 

Hence the difficulty in deciding when enough is enough. Starting 
with the referendum and then going on to the projected amendments 
in the Constitution, layer upon layer of precaution is being 
devised to keep the future in check, to see that it does not get 
out of hand. Still the germs of doubt and insecurity lodged firmly 
in the military mind are not being eradicated.

This is a pity because by suspecting the Pakistani people and 
falling prey to nameless anxieties, the military government has 
already blown what might have been an historic opportunity. By 
holding open elections and allowing everyone to participate (what 
castles would Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto have demolished?) and 
then, even as Gen Musharraf remained president, allowing for a 
transition to civilian rule would have given Pakistan the stability 
which has so long eluded it.

Referendum or no referendum, there is no real dispute across the 
political spectrum about Gen Musharraf continuing as president 
armed with substantive powers. Musharraf as president, a popularly-
elected leader as prime minister. The political parties chastened 
and therefore acting with greater responsibility. The National 
Assembly restored to its position as the fount of executive 
authority but, heeding the lessons of past failures, acting more 
wisely than in the past. The armed forces back to where they 
belong. The nation united and collectively turning its back upon 
the follies and extremist aberrations of the Zia years.

Given a modicum of vision, this was the choice the military 
government could have made. Instead of which it has opted for the 
easier solution: battening down the hatches and tightening controls 
on the political process. In other words, reaching into the past 
and seizing some of its failed nostrums. It might have been 
supposed the army leadership would have learnt from experience. But 
clearly old habits die hard and vision is not a commodity you can 
buy off a supermarket shelf. Thus the shambles of the Naqvi reforms 
which are destined to drive another stake through the heart of a 
sorely-tried nation.

There is a class of Pakistanis mostly living abroad who, depressed 
by gloom-and-doom stories from home, want desperately to hear 
something good about their country. Their concerns are 
understandable but they should ask themselves about the wisdom of 
painting a fundamentally unwholesome situation in bright colours. 
Will the paint job alter the underlying reality? Bad tidings no one 
likes but the answer to this is to change the nature of the tidings 
not shoot the messenger.

Whatever the reasons for Gen Musharraf's coup three years ago - 
there being no point in raking up old arguments - the necessity 
before Pakistan is to move ahead, leaving the discontents of the 
past behind. There is no quarrel between the army and the people.

Neither ideological nor political. Why must then the army command 
discover enemies behind every bush? Why must it conjure up threats 
where none exist? Why must it think of the political parties as 
adversaries when these should be looked upon as partners in the 
business of national consolidation?

That the political parties need to get their thinking straight is 
clear. In their behaviour there should be no room for the 
shenanigans of the nineties, the mutual bloodletting and the poor 
performance in government which paved the way for the present 
military takeover. But the army command has to clear some cobwebs 
from its mind too. 

The army in government is a doomed enterprise, destined to fail. 
There is no scope for the Indonesian model here, a model which has 
been Indonesia's ruin. Where lies Indonesia's oil wealth? 
Squandered by a corrupt elite. Pakistan doesn't even have any oil 
to squander. All the less reason for it to emulate a bad example 
and give the service chiefs a permanent role in government.

The political parties have to be given space to breathe. They'll 
keep making mistakes but that's the way democracy advances - 
through trial and error. 

There are no short-cuts to its golden fruits. As for the army, it 
has to return to its primary duty of soldiering and keeping its 
guns clean. Trying to fix organizations like Wapda and the KESC 
should be a chastening experience. Have these white elephants been 
turned around? If not, what justification for uniformed mahouts to 
sit on top of them?

Or take the most recent example of military brightness. A former 
army top gun, now communications czar, imports railway carriages 
from China only to discover that our railway platforms are six to 
nine inches too narrow to take them. 

Hence the loud sound of hammers right from Karachi to Rawalpindi as 
railway platforms are broken down to accommodate the new custom-
built carriages. Before such hilarious lunacy it is hard to decide 
whether to laugh or cry.

<a name="pree">Pre-emption as a principle not in US interest</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Henry A. Kissinger

As the anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Centre draws 
near, the administration is facing the most consequential foreign 
policy decision of the George W. Bush presidency. The president and 
Secretary of State Colin Powell have repeatedly stated that the 
United States insists on regime change in Iraq.

In an eloquent address in June at West Point, President Bush 
stressed that new weapons of mass destruction no longer permit 
America the luxury of waiting for an attack, that we must "be ready 
for pre-emptive action when necessary to defend our liberty."

At the same time, the administration's formal position is that no 
decision to resort to force has yet been taken. Ambiguity often can 
help create awareness without encumbering the discussion with the 
need for decision. But when ambiguity reaches the point of inviting 
leaks concerning military planning, congressional debate and allied 
pressures, the time has come to define a comprehensive policy for 
America and for the rest of the world.

The new approach is revolutionary. Regime change as a goal for 
military intervention challenges the international system 
established by the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which, after the 
carnage of the religious wars, established the principle of 
nonintervention in the domestic affairs of other states. And the 
notion of justified pre-emption runs counter to modern 
international law, which sanctions the use of force in self-defence 
only against actual, not potential, threats.

Therefore, an American military intervention in Iraq will be 
supported only grudgingly, if at all, by most European allies. The 
Middle East will be split into an inarticulate group, which will be 
weighing relief from radical pressures authored by Baghdad against 
the rising dangers from the local Arab street, and radical 
Islamists, already enraged by the American presence in the region. 
As for other nations, Russia will balance the blow to Arab 
radicalism against its economic stake in Iraq and the benefits of 
American goodwill against its fear of being marginalized.

China will view pre-emptive action in terms of its reluctance to 
justify intervention in its own country against its desire for a 
cooperative relationship with the United States during a period of 
political succession and integration into the world economy via the 
WTO. The most interesting, and potentially fateful, reaction may 
well be India's, which will be tempted to apply the new principle 
of pre-emption against Pakistan.

To find our way through this thicket, the administration needs to 
establish a comprehensive strategy for itself and a clear 
declaratory policy for the rest of the world. Nor can a conflict of 
such import be sustained as an expression of executive power alone. 
A way must be found to obtain adequate congressional and public 
support for the chosen course.

The administration should be prepared to undertake a national 
debate because the case for removing Iraq's capacity of mass 
destruction is extremely strong. The international regimen 
following the Treaty of Westphalia was based on the concept of an 
impermeable nation-state and a limited military technology which 
generally permitted a nation to run the risk of awaiting an 
unambiguous challenge.

But the terrorist threat transcends the nation-state; it derives in 
large part from transnational groups that, if they acquire weapons 
of mass destruction, could inflict catastrophic, even 
irretrievable, damage. That threat is compounded when these weapons 
are being built in direct violation of U.N. resolutions by a 
ruthless autocrat who sought to annex one of his neighbours and 
attacked another, with a demonstrated record of hostility toward 
America and the existing international system. The case is all the 
stronger because Saddam expelled U.N. inspectors installed as part 
of the settlement of the Gulf War and has used these weapons both 
against his own population and against a foreign adversary.

This is why policies that deterred the Soviet Union for 50 years 
are unlikely to work against Iraq's capacity to cooperate with 
terrorist groups. Suicide bombing has shown that the calculations 
of jihad fighters are not those of the cold war principals. And the 
terrorists have no national base to protect. Therefore, the concern 
that war with Iraq could unleash Iraqi weapons of mass destruction 
on Israel and Saudi Arabia is a demonstration of self-deterrence. 
If the danger exists today, waiting will only magnify possibilities 
for blackmail.

There is another, generally unstated, reason for bringing matters 
to a head with Iraq. The attack on the World Trade Centre had roots 
in many parts of the Islamic, and especially the Arab, world. It 
would not have been possible but for the tacit cooperation of 
societies that, in the words of George W. Bush, "oppose terror but 
tolerate the hatred that produces terror." While long-range 
American strategy must try to overcome legitimate causes of those 
resentments, immediate policy must demonstrate that a terrorist 
challenge or a systemic attack on the international order produces 
catastrophic consequences for the perpetrators, as well as their 
supporters, tacit or explicit.

The campaign in Afghanistan was an important first step. But if it 
remains the principal move in the war against terrorism, it runs 
the risk of petering out into an intelligence operation while the 
rest of the region gradually slides back to the pre-9/11 pattern, 
with radicals encouraged by the demonstration of American 
hesitation and moderates demoralized by the continuation of an 
unimpaired Iraq as an aggressive regional power.

The overthrow of the Iraq regime and, at a minimum, the eradication 
of its weapons of mass destruction would have potentially 
beneficent political consequences, as well: the so-called Arab 
street may conclude that the negative consequences of jihad 
outweigh any potential benefits. It could encourage a new approach 
in Syria; strengthen moderate forces in Saudi Arabia; multiply 
pressures for a democratic evolution in Iran; demonstrate to the 
Palestinian Authority that America is serious about overcoming 
corrupt tyrannies; and bring about a better balance in oil policy 
within OPEC.

For this reason, the objective of regime change should be 
subordinated in American declaratory policy to the need to 
eliminate weapons of mass destruction from Iraq as required by the 
U.N. resolutions. The restoration of the inspection system existing 
before its expulsion by Saddam is clearly inadequate. It is 
necessary to propose a stringent inspection system that achieves 
substantial transparency of Iraqi institutions. Since the 
consequences of simply letting the diplomacy run into the ground 
are so serious, a time limit should be set. The case for military 
intervention will then have been made in the context of seeking a 
common approach.

At that point, too, America's allies will be obliged to face the 
choice they have thus far evaded: between their domestic opposition 
or estrangement from the United States. Dissociation from U.S. 
actions will not save the allies from the consequences of 
abdication in a world of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction 
and distancing themselves from an ally of half a century.

Special attention must be paid to the political and psychological 
framework vis-a-vis the Arab world. An explanation is needed of why 
Iraqi weapons of mass destruction impede the solution of all 
matters of concern in the area - not in Western categories of 
security but in terms relevant to upheavals in the region. This is 
why it is so important to couple military pressures with a program 
of economic and social reconstruction in which allies and moderate 
Arab regimes should be invited to participate.

At the same time, the administration should reject the siren song 
that an Iraqi intervention should be preceded by a solution of the 
Palestine issue. It is not true that the road to Baghdad leads 
through Jerusalem. Much more likely, the road to Jerusalem will 
lead through Baghdad. The president has committed his 
administration to a three-year program for the creation of a 
Palestinian state. He has left no doubt about his determination to 
bring progress on this timetable. But that timetable should not be 
used to defer decisions that cannot wait.

In the end, however, Iraq policy will be judged by the way the 
aftermath of military operations is handled politically. Precisely 
because of the precedent-setting nature of this war, its outcome 
will determine the way American actions will be viewed 
internationally far more than the way we entered it. And we may 
find many more nations willing to cooperate in reconstruction than 
in warfare if only because no country wants to see an exclusive 
position for America in a region so central to energy supplies and 
international stability. This could be the way to relate unilateral 
American action to an international system.

Military intervention should be attempted only if we are willing to 
sustain such an effort for however long it is needed. For, in the 
end, the task is to translate intervention in Iraq into terms of 
general applicability for an international system. The imminence of 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the huge dangers it 
involves, the rejection of a viable inspection system, the 
demonstrated hostility of Saddam combine to produce an imperative 
for preemptive action. But it is not in the American national 
interest to establish preemption as a universal principle available 
to every nation.

And we are only at the beginning of the threat of global 
proliferation. Whatever the views regarding Iraq, the nations of 
the world must face the impossibility of letting such a process run 
unchecked. The United States would contribute much to a new 
international order if it invited the rest of the world, and 
especially the major nuclear powers, to cooperate in creating a 
system to deal with this challenge to humanity on a more 
institutional basis. - Los Angeles Times Syndicate

<a name="vend">Vendettas, victims and victors</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

The United States has long expected friends and allies to share its 
belief in values and concepts like democracy, secularism and 
capitalism. To this short list, you can now add an unquestioning 
and uncritical support for Israel.

For decades, American governments have stood by the Zionist state 
more as a moral imperative than an expression of a foreign policy 
objective. In its earlier, formative years, Israel was admired as a 
David beset by Goliath and drew much support from the American 
left, specially as so many Jewish intellectuals were themselves 
left-wing radicals. In addition, memories of the Nazi Holocaust 
were still fresh, and the fledgling state enjoyed the good wishes 
of many Europeans who bore a heavy burden of guilt for what had 
been done to millions of Jews.

The founding fathers of Israel included many idealists who were 
dedicated to the concepts of humanism and equality. Ranged against 
this small island of democracy was a collection of venal local 
despots with unsavoury images in the West. In terms of public 
relations alone, it is easy to see why so many intellectuals and 
idealists identified with Israel.

But years of occupation, combined with the plight of the 
Palestinian refugees and the growing arrogance of Israel with its 
elevation as the region's paramount military power have taken their 
toll. It is now seen as the regional bully, not the victim. Ever 
since the second intifada began over two years ago, the sight of 
Israeli tanks and helicopters wreaking death and destruction among 
defenceless Palestinians has angered people around the world. Even 
erstwhile European supporters have been repulsed by these televised 
images, and their governments have become increasingly critical of 
Israeli policies.

American support, however, has been reinforced by the events of 
9/11: identifying with Israel as fellow-victims of (Islamic) 
terrorism, the Bush administration has assailed the Palestinian 
freedom struggle as none of its predecessors has ever done. 

So much so that the American establishment, led by an influential 
coterie of neo-conservative Jewish columnists, has charged 
Europeans of anti-Semitism because of their relatively even-handed 
approach to the Middle East imbroglio.

Indeed, American annoyance and contempt for its European allies are 
also reinforced by a growing reluctance to get dragged into a war 
with Iraq. To Bush's inner circle of advisers, this is all evidence 
of European cunning that took advantage of American defence against 
the Soviet threat for decades, but now balks at supporting the 
United States against its enemies.

In Europe, it is the charge of anti-Semitism that stings most. In a 
recent article in the Financial Times, John Lloyd quotes George 
Will, a Washington Post columnist and a fervent supporter of 
Israel: "Anti-Semitism is a stronger force in world affairs than it 
has been since it went into a remarkably brief eclipse after the 
liberation of the Nazi concentration camps. Today, many people say 
that the Arabs and their European echoes would be mollified if 
Israel were to change its behavior. People who say that do not 
understand the centrality of anti-Semitism in the current crisis. 
The crisis has become the second - and final? - phase of the 
struggle for a final solution to the Jewish question."

Lloyd then quotes William Kristol, a former foreign policy adviser 
in Bush Senior's presidency and at present editor of the Weekly 
Standard: "We are sympathetic to Israel generally because they seem 
so much like us. They take religion seriously. They are willing to 
fight their enemies. They are patriotic and proud of their state. 
They are a settler society with a dangerous frontier." 

In a conversation with Lloyd, Gideon Rose, editor of the 
prestigious and hugely influential Foreign Affairs says: "It's 
clear that there is an anti-Israel bias in Europe. I don't think 
it's necessarily anti-Semitic. Anti-Semitism is a very serious 
charge. The Israelis believe that the Europeans would not lift too 
much of a finger to help them. If they had to rely on the Europeans 
to protect them they wouldn't be around today."

It is true that despite holding the military whip in hand in its 
fight against the Palestinians, Israel and its supporters are 
feeling isolated. In an impassioned article in a recent issue of 
France's most respected daily Le Monde, Arno Klarsfeld writes: 
"Israel is one of the rare - if not unique - countries that does 
not respond to barbarism with barbarism. Who is there to recognize 
this? Nobody.

But most countries, and particularly those who have always answered 
barbarism with barbarism, are ready to denounce self-defence 
measures Israel is forced to take for the sake of its people... Is 
it the same thing to wish to eliminate as many Jews as possible as 
to want to destroy those who organize the crimes against humanity 
that are committed nearly every day in Israel?... But European 
public opinion-makers are impervious to logic in the case of Israel 
as they are so accustomed to view Jews as passive victims..."

Ever since the escalation of violence in the Middle East, there has 
been a tendency among the supporters of Israel to silence criticism 
of the Zionist state by accusing the critics of anti-Semitism. 
Although I have long been critical of Israeli policies, I resent 
this gross oversimplification as it greatly reduces the space for 
rational debate. It is almost as if criticizing Robert Mugabe's 
policies in Zimbabwe made one a racist.

In any case, I have many Jewish friends and have long admired the 
accomplishments of this remarkably gifted race, apart from 
sympathizing with it for its trials and tribulations over the 
centuries. To be branded an anti-Semite for opposing the suicidal 
policies of successive governments in Tel Aviv is ridiculous.

The fundamental and central problem Israel and its supporters fail 
to recognize is that it is viewed by its neighbours as a colonial 
outpost, and not as an indigenous entity. Its citizens are seen as 
foreigners who have dispossessed millions of Palestinians and wish 
to grab even more land. Israel has done little to address these 
concerns: in the name of a flexible definition of 'security', it 
has steadily expanded its 1948 frontiers, and given the 
Palestinians little to hope for beyond a moth-eaten and non-viable 
state at some undetermined point in the future.

To mitigate the sufferings caused by one historical injustice - the 
Holocaust - another injustice was committed - the creation of 
Israel in a land populated by a people who were understandably 
unsympathetic to the enterprise as they had nothing to do with the 
suffering of the Jews of Europe. But life has to go on, for both 
the Israelis and the Palestinians; we cannot forever fight old 
battles whether in Kashmir or the Middle East. Sooner or later, 
Israel and the United States will have to recognize that the 
occupation of land causes resistance, and the only way to end 
violence is to evacuate the occupied territories.

<a name="pcbs">PCB's financial misdeeds exposed </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ali Kabir

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is playing a very sensitive game 
of maligning Patron-in-Chief of the PCB by misinforming the general 
public of it's financial wrongdoings.

Dawn carried a story on the financial mismanagement in the PCB on 
July 5, 2002, bringing out some facts to limelight. The PCB through 
it's Media Manager, tried to misguide the public by totally giving 
false information, forgetting that his statement will directly or 
indirectly bring the patron of PCB into some controversy. But 
showing total disregard to the patron, the PCB showed guts to 
contradict the story.

Dawn has received photo copy of the letter sent by the Manager 
Finance, Mushtaq Ahmad, which itself explains the whole truth. Dawn 
carried the story that the CBFS had not paid even appearance money 
for the last two events.

It was just a strange coincidence that just on July 4, 2002, a day 
earlier than the story appeared, the Manager Finance sent a letter 
to the CBFS urging them to arrange immediate payment of US$919,032 
which was outstanding against them.

The Finance Manager also sought clarification of the amount charged 
by the CBFS for arranging the Pakistan-West Indies series which was 
beyond imagination. The clarification was sought on the expenses 
incurred such as: Visa fee $41250, One would like to know how many 
people went to Sharjah on PCB account.

The CBFS charged the PCB an amount of $247,500/- as hotel 
accommodation for the Test series duration.

The PCB letter shows that the CBFS owes 1,319,032 out of which the 
PCB received $200,000 from the CBFS and another $200,000 from the 
Ten Sports.

How the PCB got any amount from Ten Sports is anybody's guess as, 
it has no official link with it till March 2003, when the PCB's 
contract with TWI expires.

The PCB Media Manager claimed that there is total transparency in 
finalising the bid for fresh contract. How then, Ten Sports has 
figured in financial dealing with the PCB is anybody's guess.

The PCB clarification had claimed that the accounts of the board 
were audited by renowned accounting firms till 2000-2001.

If the claim of the PCB has any credibility can it justify the 
letter of the Manager Finance has taken into account the travel 
expenses of PCB officials for April 2001 which shows that the CBFS 
spent US$1457 the travel of Mr Mohammad Bashir to Morocco and 
travelling expenses of Mr and Mrs Zakir Hussain Syed. One wonders 
since when employees wife have become entitled to travel on 
organizations expenses.

It will be better if the PCB puts it's house in order and atleast 
save the patron from such controversies with which he has nothing 
to do. He is simply figure head of the PCB by the virtue of his 
office. 

The PCB will do well by trusting people of integrity which is of 
great significance in promoting the credibility of the institution 
and should avoid mud slinging. Only men who have no credentials, 
try such methods to cover up their misdeeds.

<a name="sign">PCB signs three-year contract with CBFS</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Representative

TANGIERS, Aug 11: The Cricketers Benefit Fund Series (CBFS) said 
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has signed a three-year contract in 
which it will play at least one tournament a year.

The chairman of the CBFS, Abdul Rehman Bukhatir, told reporters 
that Sri Lanka and South Africa have also signed similar agreements 
while he was in discussions with the West Indies, New Zealand and 
Zimbabwe.

He, however, clarified that signing the contract doesn't meant that 
Pakistan will have to appear every year here. "They can appear in 
Sharjah or in Morocco, depending upon their availability," he said.

He said he was in contact with the Board of Control for Cricket in 
India (BCCI) but added that there was no constructive development 
so far.

"BCCI is dependent on government approval. I can't understand why 
they are not coming but at the same time I am convinced that they 
would come one day. "I don't think their not coming to us has 
anything to do with Pakistan. It's a political matter and I believe 
it that to the politicians. But yes, India's not playing in Sharjah 
has certainly affected our budget. We have managed so far and 
hopefully will manage in the end," he said.

India has not played in Sharjah since October 2000 during which the 
CBFS organized four tournaments. But the frustration is evident on 
the CBFS officials' faces as there is clearly a sharp drop in the 
profits in the absence of sponsors who mostly are Indians.

Bukhatir said in India's absence, the other teams were demanding 
more money than they usually do. But he said he understood their 
stand and had no grievance. Bukhatir said Ten Sports was launched 
to provide a cushion to the CBFS, adding that the sports channel 
was still young and needed to first sustain itself before it can 
pamper the organizations. "But yes, Ten Sports and the CBFS are 
supporting each other."

He said he was ambitious to have Tests at his centres and also 
indicated that he was willing to host Pakistan's home Test series 
in Sharjah. But at the same time, he admitted that the reception 
for the West Indies Tests was poor.

The CBFS chief defended his decision to make Tangiers as the latest 
venue by saying it was done because of climatic reasons.

"We can't play cricket in Sharjah at this time. But the weather 
here is excellent. We are developing more facilities and hopefully 
in years to come, it will emerge as one of the best centres.

"I know there will be a small spectators turn-out but that is 
understandable because there are very few cricket educated people 
here," he said.

<a name="impr">Improved Pakistan outplay Sri Lanka</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

TANGIERS, Aug 15: Pakistan got back into their winning ways with a 
commendable 28-run victory over Sri Lanka in the second game of the 
Morocco Cup Wednesday.

Pakistan, beaten by South Africa Monday, earned their success 
through a disciplined performance that displayed their firepower 
with the bat, athleticism in the field, and bite and penetration in 
bowling.

Put into bat by Sanath Jayasuriya, Pakistan rode on excellent half 
centuries from Saeed Anwar,Inzamam-ul-Haq and Man-of-the-Match 
Younis Khan to post an imposing 279 for five.

Waqar Younis's men restricted Sri Lanka to 251 for eight after they 
had made a breezy start by putting on 82 for one in the first 15 
overs. Pakistan were, however, fined five per cent of their match 
fee for slow over-rate.

Saeed's return to his majestic best or Inzamam's ability to carry 
the innings through or Younis's and Abdul Razzaq's whirlwind finish 
with a ruthless slaughter of Sri Lankan bowlers in the death overs 
was no big surprise because they all are well capable of doing 
this.

Usually lethargic and lazy fielders were on their toes throughout 
the 50 overs. They backed their bowlers by cutting off ones and 
twos, held all the catches that came their way except Inzamam, who 
dropped Upal Chandana when the ball was lost in the sun, and Imran 
Nazir who grassed a sitter of Atapattu in the fifth over.

Also impressive was Pakistan's bowling in the absence of Shoaib 
Akhtar. After Jayasuriya (36 off 33) took the attack to Wasim Akram 
and Waqar Younis, the young guns in Sami, Razzaq and Shahid Afridi 
rose to the occasion and bowled intelligently, according to the 
field.

Sami's inclusion gave the attack the option that was missing in the 
absence of Shoaib Akhtar. Sami bowled almost regularly at 143kph 
that made it difficult for the batsmen to adjust and throw their 
arms around. Shahid made full use of a bouncy track by bowling to a 
teasing line and length while Razzaq was as mean as ever to end up 
with three for 36.

It was this young trio that tightened the screws around Sri Lanka 
when they conceded 111 runs from their 30 overs. Such was the 
accuracy of the three that when Chandana hit Shahid was a six in 
the 35th over, it was the first boundary in 81 balls. For a change, 
it was Wasim and Waqar who got the hammering. The two old war 
horses gave away 133 runs between them, with the skipper being hit 
away for 77 after grabbing five for 38 only a couple of days back.

In the batting, there was purpose, planning and strategy evident 
from the way they handled spin king Muthiah Muralitharan. None of 
the batsmen took chances against him and concentrated on keeping 
their wickets intact but missed no opportunity to punish bad balls.

Saeed showed his class and wristy elegance with some exquisite 
stroke-play. But he must be regretting the opportunity of missing 
his 20th century, his first in two years, when he was bowled by 
Chandana while trying to manufacture a single after having hit a 
six and four in three balls. Saeed scored 70 off 77 balls that 
included seven boundaries and a six.

Inzamam played the role of the most seasoned player with perfection 
while contributing 63 off 95 balls that included five fours and a 
six.

But it was Younis Khan's clean hitting that helped Pakistan collect 
99 off the last 10 overs, including 55 from the final five overs. 
The best stroke of the match also came from the willow of Younis 
when he swept fast bowler Dilhara Fernando for an incredible six 
over square-leg. Younis slapped five fours and two sixes in his 
unbeaten 39-ball 56.

Together with Razzaq, who scored 29 off 11 balls with two fours and 
as many sixes, Younis put on 50 runs for the unfinished sixth 
wicket from 22 balls. The two were also responsible for spoiling 
Chaminda Vaas's figures when they hit him for 35 runs in his last 
two overs, including 25 in the final over of the innings.

<a name="iccp">ICC, Pakistan reject Tangiers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TANGIERS, Aug 12: Pakistan turned down a proposal to host their 
Test series against Australia in Morocco and found themselves 
backed fully by cricket's world governing body.

Abdulrehman Bukhatir, the chief organiser of one-day cricket in 
United Arab Emirates and Morocco, had offered Tangiers as a 
possible neutral venue for the Test series in October after 
Australia declined to tour Pakistan for security reasons. But 
Pakistan captain Waqar Younis rejected the proposal, saying he 
wanted to play the series closer to home where the conditions and 
crowd support suited his team.

"Tangiers is a great venue for cricket, but since the Australia 
Tests are a home series for us, we would rather play at a place 
where the pitch conditions and crowd support us," Waqar said.

The Pakistani captain declined to state his preferred option, but 
the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka and the Gulf emirate of Sharjah 
are being touted as possible venues.

ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed, here to witness Monday's opening 
match of the Morocco Cup between Pakistan and South Africa, said it 
was too early to consider Tangiers a Test venue.

"I doubt if the wicket will last five days," said Speed. "I am very 
impressed by the facilities here, but we are only looking at one-
dayers for the time being."

Speed said a final decision on where the Tests will be played 
rested with the Australian and Pakistani authorities.

The keenly-awaited series between two of the best teams in modern 
cricket has been slotted for October, soon after the ICC Champions 
Trophy tournament in Sri Lanka in September.

It is still uncertain if the series will be held at all since 
Pakistani cricket authorities are reportedly angry at Australia's 
refusal to undertake the tour. But if the series goes ahead, a 
neutral venue is expected to be finalized within the next 
fortnight.

Speed said he was hopeful the series will take place. "Its an 
important event which we all are looking forward to."-Reuters

<a name="paki">Pakistan to lose domestic audience, money after Aussie pull out</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Aug 10: Pakistan cricket stands to lose much of its 
domestic audience and income essential for a healthy future of the 
game in the wake of Australia's decision to pull-out of a planned 
October tour, officials and former players said.

"We are disappointed and so are Pakistani cricket fans as 
Australia's pull-out will prompt a decline in local interest in the 
game and cause a loss in profits," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) 
director Chishty Mujahid told AFP.

Australia ended long-running uncertainty over the October Test tour 
Friday by announcing it was withdrawing over security concerns.

Pakistan's cricket crazy fans have watched only three Tests and as 
many one-day internationals on home grounds since December 2000 
following cancellations by India, the West Indies and now Australia 
to compete in the troubled Islamic republic.

New Zealand, having already postponed their scheduled tour of 
Pakistan a week after Sept 11 attacks, cut short their rescheduled 
tour when a suicide bomb blast killed 14 people outside their hotel 
on May 8.

India is the next team on Pakistan's home series calendar with 
competition due to take place in April. But the tour is unlikely to 
take place amid friction between the nuclear-armed South Asian 
rivals over Kashmir. This leaves Pakistan likely to host only 
minnows Bangladesh in September next year, a series which is 
unlikely to generate much interest. "Its very, very unfortunate for 
Pakistan cricket that we can't play cricket at home, but 
international events are beyond our control," said former captain 
Intikhab Alam.

"Australia's decision is understandable and we must realise that 
if, God forbid, any mishap had occurred when they were here, where 
would Pakistan cricket stand then?" he said.

Alam also rejected the idea of staging an Asian boycott of 
Australia. "Pakistan would not be able to achieve anything from a 
boycott," he said.

The Former secretary of Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Zakir Hussain 
Syed, said Pakistan's problems were serious.

"Pakistan's problems are serious and the International Cricket 
Council (ICC) and ACC must decide a course of action and sort out 
ways to help Pakistan," Syed said.

Since the United States began its war on terror in neighbouring 
Afghanistan last year, security fears have forced Pakistan and the 
West Indies to shift their series to Sharjah in February-March this 
year.

Pakistan also had to relocate its Golden Jubilee year tri-series to 
be played later this month and also involving Australia, to 
Nairobi.

"The PCB has various options after Australia's pull-out and playing 
at a neutral venue is one of them. After consulting with the 
government we will take a decision on that in a couple of days," 
the PCB's Mujahid said.

Bangladesh is one of three neutral venues suggested for the series, 
with Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates also offering their 
grounds for the series. On the monetary front, Pakistan has 
incurred losses of around 25 million dollars in the last two years.

Former captain Imran Khan said Australia's withdrawal was a serious 
financial blow to Pakistan cricket. "Pakistan is financially 
devastated and if we fail to stage a home series than the PCB could 
go bankrupt," Khan said. "You can't get prosperous by playing 
outside - in cricket only home series earn you good amounts," he 
said. But ICC finance committee head Ehsan Mani, a Pakistani, 
disagreed.

"There is no question of the PCB going bankrupt because constant 
funding are provided to member countries," said Mani, who will take 
over as ICC president next year.

"Pakistan will get around seven million US dollars from the 2003 
World Cup and then another nine million from the 2007 World Cup, 
besides various other funds like a share of the ICC Champions 
Trophy," he said.-AFP

<a name="jans">Jansher returns to big time squash</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, Aug 10: Former world champion Jansher Khan has decided to 
return to the international arena, withdrawing his retirement which 
he had announced some five years ago.

Announcing his decision at a press conference here Saturday, 
Jansher said "I have gained complete fitness and feeling eagerness 
to again appear at the court to earn glory for the country as well 
as myself".

Jansher announced his retirement in 1997 after the British Open. He 
again tried to make a come back two years later when appeared in 
the Dutch Open but a nagging knee forced him to to quit for the 
second time.

"I have got my knees operated and now I am playing squash for the 
last three months without any problem. It boosted my morale and 
prompted me to make come back", Jansher winner of eight World Open 
and six British Open titles said.

Elaborating his plan, Jansher said that before playing abroad he 
would appear in three international tournaments to be held in 
Pakistan this year.

The PNS tournament which is being held in Karachi from Sept 18 will 
be the first appearance of Jansher followed by Chief of Air Staff 
tournament in Peshawar and another in Lahore.

Jansher who dominated world squash for nearly a decade, was 
optimistic about winning the three home events. "Competing in these 
tournaments will bring him in top world ranking of around 40. It 
will also boost my confidence, a necessary factor to deliver goods 
out of the country" he added.

While replying to a question, Jansher said that he had no plans of 
making a come back, but it was his complete fitness which prompted 
him to take the decision.

The 34-years old Jansher said that in past he had been winning 
international tournaments even with the fitness problems. He said 
that during his long absence of five years no Pakistani player 
could attract the international circuit which showed that he would 
face little difficulties in winning the local tournaments.

Jansher said that he would also continue with his job in setting up 
an academy in Pakistan and claimed that there was lot of talent in 
Pakistan and with proper coaching quality players could be produced 
in abundance.

Jansher who was recently retired by PIA alongwith another squash 
great Jahangir Khan and cricket legend Zaheer Abbas declared that 
he was not facing any problems in getting sponsorship for him.

<a name="mayg">Jansher may get wildcard</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 11: Former world squash champion Jansher Khan, who 
announced Saturday he was returning to the court after quitting 
almost five years ago, is likely to be granted a wildcard for this 
October's CAS Open in Peshawar.

Although Jansher has not officially intimated the Pakistan Squash 
Federation (PSF) of his plans, it is understood that he will be 
requesting the squash managers for a wildcard soon.

Jansher, who held news conference in Lahore to announce his 
comeback, said that he would first be competing in the CNS Open in 
Karachi that precedes the CAS tournament. But an official of the 
PSF, requesting anonymity told Dawn that if he does not re-register 
himself with the Professional Squash Association (PSA) before the 
closing date of entries for the CNS championship, he will have to 
qualify for the main round.

Jansher, 34, effectively dominated the sport for almost a decade 
during which he won eight World Open and six British Open titles.

He quit in 1997.
