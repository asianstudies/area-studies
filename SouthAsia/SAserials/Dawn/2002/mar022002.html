<a name="paki">Pakistan asks India to explain position</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Khaleeq Kiani

ISLAMABAD, Feb 26: Pakistan has sought a report from India on an
alleged construction of a gate-structure on the Chenab river for
diversion of its water in violation of the Indus Basin Treaty,
1960. This is for the first time since the inception of the treaty
that a water-related issue other than Wullar Barrage is being taken
up at the official diplomatic level instead of relevant agencies
like the Permanent Indus Commission (Pic) or the Federal Flood
Commission (FFC).

The Foreign Office has formally asked India to provide details
about the gate-structure on the Chenab that is apparently meant for
the construction of a 450-mw Baglihar Power Project in occupied
Kashmir. A senior government official told Dawn that the Foreign
Office has officially expressed concern over the alleged violation
of the Indus Basin Treaty with India and has asked for a report.

The Foreign Office was asked by the Ministry of Water and Power
that India was not responding to the relevant channels of the Pic
that had expressed concern over the reports that the decades-old
treaty was being violated through a gate-structure.

A visit of the Pakistan commissioner on Pic scheduled for December
2001 was cancelled at the last moment following refusal by the
Indian Pic commissioner to arrange his visit of the areas in the
Kashmir region for the inspection of rivers, particularly the
Chenab. A senior official of the power ministry said India was
quoting prevailing tense situation and military build-up at the
Line of Control as an excuse to show its inability to facilitate
the visit and subsequent inspection.

The two sides had agreed in May last year during annual meeting of
the Pic in Islamabad that Pakistan commissioner would visit the
river areas for verification and till then India would not proceed
on the proposed project unless cleared by Pakistan. "At least that
commitment has not been honoured by the Indian side," said a power
ministry official.

He said there was no official word available from India despite
repeated requests on Baglihar project for quite some time but media
reports obviously emanating from across the border suggest India
had started proceeding on the hydel power project. "We had asked
the Foreign Office to use its offices and sources for a report on
the Chenab waters diversion since we have not been able to have
Indian response," the official said.

In May last year, Pakistan had formally registered its concern over
the construction of Baglihar project with unequivocal stand that
the existing project design was unacceptable to it. The Chenab
River belonged to Pakistan but India could construct run-of-the
river power projects and the ones that did not divert or reduce the
water flow. India had agreed to come up with a revised design and
data for further discussion and facilitate the visit of Pakistani
engineers to inspect the site.

On the question of the gate-structure, the treaty says: "If the
conditions at the site of a plant make a gated spillway necessary,
the bottom level of the gates in normal closed position shall be
located at the highest level consistent with sound and economical
design and satisfactory construction and operation of the works."

Under the treaty, Pakistan has exclusive rights to use water of
western rivers - Indus, Jehlum and Chenab - while eastern rivers -
Ravi, Sutlej and Beas - have been assigned to India. Brokered by
the World Bank, that is also a guarantor, the 1960 treaty had
helped resolve a severe resource distribution problem in the
aftermath of partition.

In early 1980s, too, India breached the treaty and tried to
construct Wullar Barrage over Jehlum river. Though the Indian
attempt was thwarted yet the issue continues to be on the bilateral
agenda for monitors. Except this and some minor differences from
time to time, the river-sharing arrangement has, so far, worked
well and survived wars and periods of high tension.

Under Article VIII of the treaty: "If either party plans to
construct any engineering work which would cause interference with
the waters of any of the Rivers and which, in its opinion, would
affect the other party materially, it shall notify the other party
of its plans and shall supply such date relating to the work as may
be available and as would enable the other party to inform itself
of the nature, magnitude and effect of the work."

<a name="noar">No arms race with India: Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Feb 28: Pakistan may reassess its defence requirements
in the light of the proposed big increase in the allocation for
armed forces in the Indian budget, Director-General of the Inter-
Services Public Relations (ISPR), Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi said at a
joint news briefing at the Foreign Office, though reiterating
Islamabad was not in arms race with its neighbour.

He said: "Just because India has raised its defence budget is no
reason for Pakistan to react, or follow suit."

<a name="nara">Narayanan's remarks unfortunate, says ISPR</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Feb 25: The spokesman for President Musharraf, Maj-Gen
Rashid Qureshi, termed Indian President K.R. Narayanan's speech in
the Indian Parliament "unfortunate and disappointing." When asked
to comment, ISPR director-general said Mr Narayanan in his speech
before the Indian parliament "had spoken in aggressive and hostile
language."

He said: "Pakistan rejects these allegations with all force, at its
command. Pakistan wants to make it clear that it would never
deviate from its principled stand in its fight against terrorism
and curbing of extremism," he said, adding emphatically: "No
tactics of India would ever succeed in intimidating Pakistan."

The international community, he said, had already condemned the
aggressive posture adopted by India, by always advising New Delhi
to enter into dialogue with Pakistan, and desist from escalating
tension or resorting to any act of adventurism.

Mr Qureshi said India should face the reality and desist from
resorting to the state terrorism. He emphatically declared that
Pakistan would never hold talks on the terms dictated by India.
Such conditions, he said, did not reflect sincerity of India,
rather it carried vested interest of New Delhi. Gen Qureshi said
the BJP had conducted election campaign in the recent polls by
carrying out baseless propaganda against Pakistan. "But, it
suffered a humiliating defeat in these elections which included the
largest Indian State of Uttar Pradesh."

He said: "This amply proved that the people of India had rejected
the hostile posture of the BJP leadership." The Indians, he added,
had thus proved to the BJP government the need for resolving the
Kashmir dispute and other issues with Pakistan. "But, it seems, the
Indian leadership have not learnt any lesson from their defeat and
rejected the sentiments of their own people."

The spokesman said: "In fact, the expectations of the Indian people
stand outrightly frustrated on the basis of the actions of the BJP
leadership." He said if the Indian government had any interest in
the peace and stability of South Asia, the Indian President would
have advised his government to withdraw its forces from the borders
and immediately resume talks with Pakistan on Kashmir dispute. -APP

<a name="nota">No talks unless demands fulfilled: Indian president</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Feb 25: The Indian government responded to an arriving
political crisis with calls for a military preparedness that would
deter Pakistan and some other unnamed countries that may threaten
its security, and said a massive troop deployment on its western
borders was there to stay until Islamabad met some key conditions.

President K.R. Narayanan, opening the parliament's budget session a
day after the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was declared routed in
key state polls, said there could be no talks with Pakistan unless
Islamabad gave evidence of steps to stop cross-border terrorism in
Kashmir. Narayanan accused Pakistan of having helped the terrorists
who it says attacked the Indian parliament on Dec 13 with the aim
of eliminating politicians and MPs present there.

Spelling out the measures against Pakistan, Narayanan said: "The
necessary level of military strength and preparedness will be
maintained to deter any aggression. On a parallel track, we have
taken several diplomatic and political measures against Pakistan.
The Indian president, who is due to retire in August if he does not
seek a second term, spelt out conditions for resuming talks with
Pakistan.

"We keep hearing calls of resumption of dialogue with Pakistan.
Terrorism and dialogue cannot go together. Recent history is
witness to the fact that, whereas India has always been ready for
meaningful and fruitful talks with Pakistan, it is Pakistan that
has ensured their failure with its acts of betrayal."

He said India was prepared to resume the dialogue process with
Pakistan, provided Islamabad satisfies New Delhi "that it has
indeed taken effective steps to end the training, equipping and
financing of the terrorists and stop their infiltration into Jammu
and Kashmir and other parts of India.

"We also demand that Islamabad hand over to us the 20 terrorists
who have committed grave crimes in India and who continue to
receive shelter in Pakistan. Positive action by Islamabad on these
demands is the test of its sincerity to end its hostility against
India and to pave the way for discussing all the outstanding
issues, including that of Jammu and Kashmir, in a peaceful manner,
through bilateral dialogue," Narayanan said.

Narayanan spoke of some other problems India was having with its
neighbours but did not name them. He said the recent test-firing of
the nuclear capable Agni missile was a step towards checking these
threats. Narayanan also spoke of domestic problems brewing in the
town of Ayodhya where Hindu zealots tore down a mosque in 1992.

"The Ayodhya dispute is one of the contentious issues before the
nation. Its amicable and speedy resolution is crucial for communal
harmony and national integration. The government is firmly of the
view that this dispute can be resolved, either through mutual
agreement among all the parties concerned, or through a verdict of
the judiciary," Narayanan said.

"The government of India, being the statutory receiver, is duty-
bound to maintain the status quo at the disputed site in Ayodhya.
It will also ensure that all necessary measures will be taken to
ensure the preservation of law and order," he said.

Narayanan said militancy and extremism in India's north-eastern
states were the chief obstacles to tranquillity, prosperity, and
welfare in the region. He also offered India's help to Nepal to
help fight a raging Maoist insurgency in the kingdom.

<a name="5mre">$5m reward for Pearl's killer's clue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Feb 27: Pakistan was considering the US requests to
extradite British-born militant Sheikh Omar, the confessed
mastermind of slain US reporter Daniel Pearl's abduction, as
Washington offered a five-million-dollar reward for information on
the journalist's killers.

"Today we are announcing a five-million-dollar reward for
information leading to the arrest or conviction in any country of
who is responsible for the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl,"
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters in
Washington.-AFP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
TOKYO, March 1: Government said it reserved the right to put the
confessed mastermind behind the abduction of murdered US journalist
Daniel Pearl on trial in one of its own courts. Pakistan Foreign
Secretary Inam-ul-Haque said his government was still considering
US request to extradite British-born militant Shaikh Omar, the
confessed organiser of Pearl's kidnapping.

"I am not ruling out the possibilities of extradition," Haque told
a news conference at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan.
"The government is examining the request." But he added Pakistan
has "the first right" to try to punish Omar in a domestic court.

Washington has stepped up pressure on the Pakistan government to
extradite Omar, while offering a five-million-dollar reward for
information on the Wall Street Journal correspondent's killers.

Britain said it would not object to the London-born Omar's
extradition. Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan
confirmed on Thursday that extradition "has been discussed" between
Islamabad and Washington, but added: "For the moment we will
continue with our investigations." In the wake of Pearl's abduction
and gruesome murder, Haque also promised his government would make
"maximum efforts to provide protection for all Pakistanis and non-
Pakistani residents in Pakistan."

But he continued: "Certain basic precautions should also be taken
by those who are living in Pakistan because the threat certainly
has not disappeared completely." Haque, Pakistan's most senior
foreign ministry mandarin, was visiting Tokyo to prepare a visit to
Japan by President Pervez Musharraf later this month.-AFP

<a name="mayb">Omar may be handed over to US, says official</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Feb 26: According to the extradition treaty with the
United States which Pakistan adopted in 1947, British-born militant
Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, main suspect in Pearl's kidnap and murder
can be handed over to the US if his Pakistani citizenship is
established, as authorities are not sure whether he is Pakistani
national.

"It is not confirmed that he (Omar Sheikh) is a Pakistani national,
this has to be checked," Abdur Rashid Khan, additional secretary
and official spokesman for the Interior Ministry told Dawn. He
said: "Unless he renounces his Pakistani citizenship, the
presumption is that he is holding double nationality."

Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, whose parents hail from the occupied
Kashmir, was born and educated in England, entered into Pakistan in
1999 from Afghanistan along with Maulana Azhar Masood- both were
brought in Kandhar by Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh for the
release of Indian hijacked plan.

Contrary to reports emanating from the United States that no
extradition treaty exists, Pakistan has extradited about 20 persons
in last 10 years. Majority of those so far extradited were alleged
drug smugglers.

<a name="mush">Musharraf, Chamberlin discuss Omar extradition</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Feb 26: President Pervez Musharraf and the US ambassador
to Pakistan Wendy Chamberlin discussed the possible extradition to
the United States of the suspected mastermind of the kidnap of
murdered American reporter Daniel Pearl, a US spokesman said.

The meeting comes a day after President Bush said Washington wanted
to put the British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh on trial in the
United States and could use a colonial era treaty to extradite him.
"The ambassador thanked the Pakistan president for the ongoing
police cooperation and further movement on the Pearl case," a US
embassy spokesman said in Islamabad. "The other subject that was
raised was the question of extradition," the spokesman said,
adding, "there are no details".

Asked if President Musharraf expressed support for extradition, the
spokesman said: "This is an ongoing investigation. There is not a
whole lot we can say on this." In Washington, law-enforcement
officials said the US Justice Department was strongly considering
bringing criminal charges in Pearl's kidnapping and murder.

US officials said Washington considered a 1931 extradition treaty
with Britain - then the colonial ruler of the territory on which
Pakistan was established in 1947 - was still in effect. The US
embassy spokesman confirmed extraditions from Pakistan to the
United States had occurred in the past under the treaty, but
declined to give details of the cases. -Reuters

<a name="anot">Another accused records statement: Daniel Pearl case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, March 1: Judicial magistrate Karachi, South, Ms Erum
Jehangir, recorded the confessional statement of another accused in
the U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl's abduction and murder case.

The accused, Syed Salman Saqib, was produced before the court amid
tight security.  His confessional statement ended at about 1:10 pm
and he was sent to jail in an armoured personnel carrier.

According to the prosecution, the accused acted as a contact
between the main accused Ahmed Omar Shaikh and the co-accused Fahad
Naseem who allegedly sent emails regarding the abduction of Daniel
Pearl. No details were available regarding the confessional
statement. However, the counsel for the accused, Khwaja Naveed
Ahmed, told newsmen in the premises of the City Courts that the
accused had perhaps stated his role in the crime.

According to Khwaja Naveed Ahmed, the magistrate had refused to
supply to him and the police the copies of the confessional
statement and directed him to get the copies of the statements of
the accused Fahad and Salman from the trial court, on the beginning
of the trial. "This time the magistrate did not allow me to read
the statement saying that I had disclosed the confessional
statement of the accused Fahad Nasim to the media", he said.

The defence counsel also stated that the accused had complained to
the magistrate that he was not feeling well due to his old
injuries. The magistrate ordered the jail authorities to provide
the accused with all basic medical facilities. She also directed
Khwaja Naveed to file an application before the administrative
judge of the Anti-Terrorism Courts regarding the medical treatment
of the accused.

Khwaja Naveed said that Salman had been in custody since February
11, 2002, while his statement was recorded now. He added that any
statement made after such a long period had no value. The
administrative judge for the ATCs on February 25, 2002, had
extended the police remand of three accused, Salman Saqib, Shaikh
Muhammad Adil and Ahmed Omar Saeed Shaikh, till March 12, 2002. The
fourth arrested accused, Fahad Nasim, had earlier recorded his
confessional statement.-PPI/APP

<a name="cour">Court extends remand of suspects in Pearl case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 25: The prime suspect in the Daniel Pearl case, Ahmed
Omar Saeed Shaikh, and two others told the Administrative Judge of
the anti- terrorism courts that police had forcibly obtained their
signatures on blank papers, while police obtained their further
remand for 14 days, till March 12. Justice Shabbir Ahmed in his
order directed police not to coerce the accused for obtaining
confessions nor signatures on blank papers during custody.

Ahmad Omar Saeed Shaikh, Mohammed Salman and Mohammed Adil were
brought to the Sindh High Court amid tight security with their
faces muffled with white cloth, to obtain their further remand from
Justice Shabbir Ahmed, who is also the Administrative Judge of the
anti-terrorism courts.

Raja Qureshi, the Advocate-General Sindh, who was accompanied by
the SP investigations II, Manzoor Mughal, and the investigation
officer, told newsmen that police obtained a further remand for 14
days under sub-section 5 of section 19 of the amended ATA laws.

The police remand had been obtained to enable them to find the dead
body of Daniel Pearl and recover weapons, he said. Answering a
question, he said it would not be an indefinite process. He claimed
that the prosecution had discovered a new piece of evidence but did
not present it today before the Administrative Judge. It would be
presented in the final challan, he said.

He claimed that the suspects told the Administrative Judge that
they were not manhandled or tortured during custody. While granting
the remand, Justice Ahmed in his order said one of the accused,
Ahmed Omar Shaikh, had stated that during custody police had been
pressured to obtain his confession and his signature on blank paper
which had been obtained. So was the statement of the two other
accused.

Justice Ahmed in his order also directed police not to coerce the
accused and not to obtain their signatures on blank paper during
the remand.

Khawaja Naveed Ahmed, counsel for Salman and Adil, told newsmen
after police obtained remand that Omar Shaikh told Justice Ahmed
that "he has been in police custody for 20 days and now they are
seeking my signatures for extracting my confession, which I do not
want to make. Yesterday I was forced to sign blank papers." The
other two accused complained of the same, he said.

The prime suspect in the Daniel Pearl kidnapping case, Ahmed Omar
Saeed Shaikh, had on Feb 14 stated before an ATC judge that as far
as he understood the US journalist was dead. He had also stated
that "I did kidnap him," adding: "I don't want to defend the case."
Khawaja Naveed told newsmen that police had shown Ahmed Omar Saeed
Shaikh, Syed Salman Saqib, Mohammed Adil and Fahad Naseem in
custody. Fahad has been remanded in jail custody after recording
his section 164 statement.

The names of the absconders are Amjad Husain Farooqi alias Hyder
Farooqi alias Hasan Mansoor, Asim alias Qasim, Hashim alias Arif,
Hasan, Imtiaz Siddiqui, Ahmed Bhai and an unknown person who took
photographs of Daniel Pearl in captivity with camera and sent these
through e-mail to the international media.

WASHINGTON, Feb 26: The pregnant widow of Daniel Pearl said she
still had great affection for Pakistan despite her husband's murder
and praised investigators who tried to rescue him. In her first
interviews since her husband's videotaped killing by his captors
was disclosed last week, Mariane Pearl said the Pakistani people,
and especially investigators, had shown her great compassion and
empathy during the ordeal.

"My feelings and my affection for this country have not changed
because of what happened here.  On the contrary, the people have
shown tremendous support to me. They have shared my sorrow," said
Mrs Pearl in an interview with CNN from Karachi. "I know they feel
bad, ashamed, sad about what happened," added Mrs Pearl, a French
national.

Mariane Pearl, who is seven months pregnant with the couple's first
child, said Pakistani investigators had shown unlimited amounts of
courage despite having limited resources. -Reuters

ISLAMABAD, Feb 28: Pakistan is considering the release of some of
2,060 Muslim militants detained in a sweep last month despite its
current crackdown on such activists, a senior government official
said. The militants are from five banned Islamic groups, including
two India accuses of carrying out a Dec-13 suicide raid on the
Indian parliament. "We are in the process of categorising these
people to see who are innocent and who are dangerous," Brig Javed
Iqbal Cheema, head of the Interior Ministry's Crisis Management
Cell, told Reuters.

The cell oversees the crackdown on Muslim militants ordered by
President Gen Pervez Musharraf in his address on Jan 12. "We are
working on a policy to deal with them. It will take some time to
finalise this policy," Cheema said. "We may ask them to fill a

Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Feb 28: Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) Amir Qazi Husain Ahmad was
formally released following acceptance of his bail bonds by Judge
Maqbool Mahmood Bajwa of the anti-terrorist court. The release was
delayed on account of rejection of his first bail bonds on the
ground that registration deed accompanying the same was old. Fresh
bail bonds were then furnished with another registration deed.

As a result, the JI leader could not address the Jamaat workers
gathered in the morning at Mansoora to greet him. Instead, JI
(Punjab) Amir Hafiz Muhammad Idrees read his message issued from
the hospital where he awaited release.

<a name="spec">Special court releases Qazi Husain on bail</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Feb 27: Jamaat-i-Islami amir Qazi Husain Ahmed was released
following the acceptance of his bail application by Anti-Terrorist
Court Judge Mahmood Maqbul Bajwa. He will leave his hospital bed
for a few hours to visit Mansoora to meet Jamaat workers. He will
return to hospital after the meetings.

The court ordered the release of the JI amir on furnishing two bail
bonds of Rs100,000 each which were furnished accordingly. Qazi
Husain Ahmed was not produced in the court because he was
indisposed and admitted to hospital. Qazi Husain Ahmed had been
arrested on Jan 28 in a case registered against him and several
others in connection with the protest demonstrations on arrival of
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpaee in the provincial
metropolis in 1999. All the co-accused named in the FIR had been
granted bail.

The court heard arguments on his bail application and reserved
judgement. His judicial remand, which was ending, was also extended
by one day. Meanwhile, Qazi Husain Ahmed has proposed observing of
a national solidarity day by all religious factions to combat
terrorist activities of enemies of Islam.

In a statement issued from the Johar Town hospital before being
released on bail on the orders of the Anti-Terrorist Court, the JI
amir said that the firing on the Rawalpindi mosque was an anti-
Islamic act but the imperialist agents were trying to bring a bad
name to the religious elements by giving it a sectarian colour.

He said that the government officials served the interest of the
enemy and brought a bad name to Islam by giving a sectarian colour
to the acts of terrorism. He called upon the ulema of all the sects
to forge unity in their rank and file to face the conspiracy to
divide the Muslims by giving a sectarian colour to acts of
terrorism.

<a name="10sh">10 shot dead in mosque attack</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohammad Asghar and Baqir Sajjad Syed

RAWALPINDI, Feb 26: Ten people were shot dead and 16 others
critically injured in a sectarian-related terrorism, hospital and
police sources told Dawn. The hospital authorities feared that the
death toll may rise as the condition of around four injured was
serious. The injured and the dead were taken to the Holy Family
Hospital and later some of them were removed to the Rawalpindi
General Hospital.

According to the eyewitnesses, three terrorists on a motorcycle
came outside Shah-i-Najaf mosque, when the Maghrib prayers were
being offered. Two of the assailants walked into the mosque and
locked the door from inside and the third one stood outside.

"The two men, wearing shalwar kameez, first started hurling abuses
and then sprayed bullets on the Namazis," Shabir Zaki one of the
injured told Dawn. Another eyewitness said one of the attackers
fired shots at the worshippers while the other loaded the empty gun
and continued targeting. One of the injured, describing from the
hospital bed the appearance of the assailants, said they were fair
colored and well-built and approximately five-and-a-half feet high.
They were having well-trimmed beards, he added.

As soon as the shooting started, the Namazis, who were around 40 in
number, fell on the ground and their screams and groaning could be
heard loudly, an eyewitness said.

"It was a horrible scene, bodies were lying in a pool of blood as I
rushed to switch on the public address system of the mosque to seek
the help of the neighbours," Mr Zaki, in charge of the mosque said.
The private guard of the mosque, who was supposed to be on duty,
was himself saying prayers and was killed in the attack. Moving
scenes were witnessed in the hospital as the heirs came to identify
the bodies of the victims.

The charged heirs of the deceased and injured who had gathered in a
large number outside the emergency ward of the HFH, chanted slogans
against the government and accused the police and district
administration of not making adequate preventive measures that led
to the massacre. They said the administration had refused to allow
them to construct a boundary wall around the mosque, which could
have prevented the incident.

Police guards had been removed from the city's worship places few
days back. The newly appointed Rawalpindi Senior Superintendent of
Police, Morawat Shah, said it was almost impossible to depute
police guards at each and every mosque and Imambargah. "We cannot
term it police negligence," the SSP said.

Rawalpindi Range Deputy Inspector-General of Police Fareed Nawaz
said the killing appeared to be sectarian motivated, and it was
most probable that the killers had fled to neighboring Islamabad.
"They might have crossed over to Islamabad. We have alerted the
federal capital administration in this connection and have asked
them to keep an eye on suspicious persons," the DIG further said.

After a session with the commander of the 111 brigade, Brig
Shafquat Ahmed, the DIG said they had decided to conduct raids at
the places of known sectarian activists to track down the killers.
But Brig Shafquat, who had been monitoring police performance,
refused to comment on the gory incident.

He ruled out the possibility of calling in troops for maintaining
law and order, and said their role would only be limited to the
investigation side of the tragedy. The weapon used in the attack
has been identified by the police as Kalashnikov. However, no
arrest had been made by the police till the filing of this report.
It was the first major attack of this kind since President Pervez
Musharraf announced a crackdown on extremist and sectarian groups
last month. The IG of Punjab Police, announced Rs500,000 reward for
giving information about the assailants of the incident.

<a name="scuf">Scuffle at PAF base: 6 airmen killed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporters

ISLAMABAD, Feb 27: Air Chief Marshal Musaf Ali Mir presented a
report to President Gen Pervez Musharraf about the tragic killing
of six airmen at Sargodha airbase. The air chief apprised the
President that special investigation bureau of Pakistan Air Force
had already been detailed to conduct thorough investigation into
the incident.

According to a PAF source, one airman belonging to Kohat opened
fire with his service weapon on fellow colleagues following a minor
scuffle while playing an indoor game.

"While playing indoor games at PAF base Sargodha, a scuffle took
place amongst the airmen. In this unfortunate incident one of them
started indiscriminate shooting which resulted in the death of six
airmen," a PAF press release said. The accused has been arrested
and a court of inquiry has been convened by the PAF authorities to
establish the facts of the incident, it added. The PAF public
relations wing when contacted said that they had no information
about the number of injured. According to reports the men were
playing a board game when the fight broke out. Sources said four
people died.

FGCM: The PAF authorities are considering the option of holding a
Field General Court Martial of the airman who killed his six
colleagues, senior officials told Dawn. The matter would be decided
in a few days, Air Commodore Qadeer Hashmi said. About probable
causes, he said: "The initial investigations into the incident
ruled out the possibility of sectarian or ethnic causes." The
officials said the Special Investigation Bureau is looking into the
possibility if there was an enmity among the airmen or was the
tragedy simply an act of a man who lost his cool and went berserk.
The actual causes would be clear in a day or two, he said.

<a name="newl">New law on reserved seats soon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Feb 25: The government is all set to introduce a law
under which the political parties getting less than 10 per cent of
votes for the general seats, will not be entitled to contest
elections for the seats reserved for women and technocrats.

Official sources said that an ordinance had been sent to President
Pervez Musharraf for signature and it would be promulgated within
days. Any political party securing less than 10 per cent of the
total votes in the general seats will not be entitled to contest
for any reserved seats. However, an exception is likely to be
created for a situation in which only one party secured 10 per cent
of votes. In that case the next party with five per cent of votes
will be entitled to nominate candidates for reserved seats on the
basis of votes it secured in the national and provincial assembly
elections.

Election to general seats of National Assembly and provincial
assemblies will be held on the basis of single member territorial
constituency method and they will be elected by a direct vote. The
whole province will be a constituency for the reserved seats of
women and technocrats. Such seats will be allocated on the basis of
population.

The National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB) is at present working on a
definition of the technocrat which shall be acceptable to all
quarters. The NRB definition says a technocrat means a person with
at least masters' degree or equivalent professional qualification
and is a person of distinction, recognized nationally and
internationally for his professional competence and has a minimum
of 15 years' experience at a high level, either in administration
or management or in the field of his specialization.

The NRB definition so far is being opposed by certain quarters who
think that it will generate a lot of controversy. According to the
NRB definition very few prominent lawyers, engineers or scientists,
having national and international recognition, will qualify for the
reserved seats. "Even persons like Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan will not be
qualified for a technocrat's seat," the official source said.

<a name="elec">Electronic media rules spelt out</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 1: The President promulgated ordinance
establishing Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority which
has been empowered to issue licences for establishment of radio,
television, cable television, and closed circuit television.

The ordinance called Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority
Ordinance, 2002, would issue licences for establishing and
operating broadcast or CTV stations. Broadcast media has been
defined by the law as "broadcast by radio, television, including
cable television, closed circuit television, direct broadcasting,
multi-point multi-channel distribution system for radio and
television."

No foreigner or foreign company would be entitled to apply for
licence. The objective of the law is stated to be improvement in
the standards of information, education, entertainment and to
enlarge the choice available to the people of Pakistan in the media
for news, current affairs, religious knowledge, art, culture,
science, technology, economic development, social sector concerns,
music, sports, drama, and other subjects of public and national
interest.

The principal office of the authority will be at Islamabad. The
PEMRA will be responsible for regulating the establishment and
operation of all broadcast and CTV stations in Pakistan established
for the purpose of international, national, provincial, district,
local or special target audience.

The law empowers the federal government to issue directives to
PEMRA on policy matters and such directives would be binding on the
authority. If a question arises whether any matter was a matter of
policy or not, the decision of the federal government would be
final.

The authority will consist of a chairman and nine members to be
appointed by the President. The chairman will be an eminent
professional of known integrity and competence having substantial
experience in media, business, management, finance, economics or
law.

Out of nine members, one will be nominated by the federal
government on full time basis and five would be eminent citizens
chosen to ensure representation of all provinces. Federal
information and interior secretaries will be ex-officio members.
The law requires that chairman and members of the authority will
not associate themselves with any person or entity engaged in
applying for a licence or operating a broadcast station established
within the purview of the authority or in providing services or
products to the authority. A PEMRA fund would be established with
the seed money by the federal government, fees for issuance of
licences of operating.

<a name="allh">All hospitals put on high alert: Kasi: 'Congo fever' outbreak</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 1: All federal and provincial hospitals have been
put on high alert after the outbreak of 'Congo fever', the federal
health minister, Dr Abdul Malik Kasi, said. The Punjab health
department has been asked to involve animal husbandry to check the
epidemic, Mr Kasi said. The federal health authorities have
requested the Punjab government to destroy 'ticks', the apparent
source of Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), by asking the
animal husbandry department to spray chemicals.

Dr Kasi told reporters here at his Secretariat that Congo fever was
under control as both the federal as well as the provincial
governments had taken appropriate preventive measures. Besides,
efforts were also being made to acquire 20 doses of intravenous
vaccines as the present stock of six had depleted to two only. The
medicine is very expensive with each course costing $10,000.

He also appealed to the people not to be scared as the disease's
early warning system was fully operational at the National
Institute of Health (NIH) and was monitoring the entire situation
in the country.

The minister was talking to reporters in the wake of four recent
deaths due to Congo virus in Rawalpindi. The director-general,
Health, Rear Admiral Mohammad Aslam, NIH's executive director, Dr
Athar Saeed Dil, Pims' executive director Prof Azhar Mahmood
Qureshi, Medical Superintendent (MS), Federal Government Services
Hospital (FGSH), Dr Javaid Chaudhry and MS, Holy Family hospital
(HFH), Rawalpindi, Dr Nisar Cheema were also present.

The reporters were told that a team of specialists had been sent to
Bagh in Azad Kashmir from where the first patient came to the HFH.
Dr Athar Saeed Dil informed that the blood samples of 15 affected
Congo virus patients had been dispatched to laboratories in South
Africa, as Pakistan, like many other countries, lacked a
sophisticated laboratory which required P-3 level facilities.
However, the NIH was trying to develop such a sophisticated
laboratory at its premises.

Similarly, the hospital staff has been informed about the
preventive measures. The report from South Africa is likely to
arrive in a week's time. Meanwhile, Prof Abbas Hayat Baloch,
professor of pathology in the Rawalpindi Medical College (RMC),
said 49 people were under strict surveillance as they had direct or
indirect contacts with the Congo virus-affected patients, who died
in the hospital.

The HFH management had a list of 131 people who came into close
contact with the Congo virus patients. It has admitted 12 patients
who have been kept under isolation which also includes two doctors.
They have been put on prophylactic treatment which costs Rs4,115
per patient.

To a question, Dr Athar warned the people not to take oral anti-
virus medicines, as these were very strong medicines though cheap
and manufactured locally. He also suggested that the doctors,
especially the paramedics, should take extra care and insist on the
history of a patient before treating him or her because the
symptoms of CCHF were quite similar to that of common flu. He also
assured that the virus could be treated if detected at an initial
stage.

Giving details, he said 192 cases of the CCHF had been reported
from 1976 till date, out of which 63 people died with 30 per cent
mortality rate. The first case was reported in 1976 in Chaghi and
Loralai (Balochistan). The Pims' executive director also informed
that the blood bank and the hospital's pathology laboratories,
which the management had sealed, would soon be reopened after NIH
certification.

KARACHI, Feb 28: Two persons, a policeman and a prisoner, died and
11 others, including police officials, prisoners and a shopkeeper,
were wounded when unknown assailants ambushed a prisoner van in the
built-up area of Bhorapir.

It seemed that the ambush had been aimed at freeing some of the
prisoners, a senior police official observed.

A senior police official told Dawn that the firing had been so
intense that the policeman sitting in the back of the van could not
return the fire. Two police officials present at a police picket
located near the Chuna Chowk returned the fire, forcing the
assailants to flee, said SSP Manzoor Mughal. He said the assailants
had been travelling in a yellow cab.

At least 28 bullet holes had been spotted on the prisoner van, on
the back side alone, he added. "Had the two policemen not returned
the fire, the assailants could have freed some of the prisoners,"
the SSP maintained.

<a name="heav">Heavy buying in PTCL features stock market trading</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 1: Blue chips maintained their upward drive and
mostly finished further higher under the lead of PTCL and some
other pivotals barring PSO, which ran into profit-selling at the
inflated levels. The KSE 100-share index gained another 8.55 points
at 1,774.51 amid another massively traded session.

The rising volumes though in selected shares, notably those which
are under the process of privatization, show that buying interest
is expanding to the broader market, which well mean that investors
are taking long positions and for good reasons too.

Heavy buying in PTCL featured the trading on the stock market where
current favourites managed to finish the weekend session on a firm
note despite larger unloading by jobbers and sundry speculators.

The KSE 100-share index eying the next chart point of 1,800,
maintained its upward steady drive on the strength of leading base
shares notably the PTCL and ended with a fresh rise of 8.55 points
at 1,774.51 as compared with 1,765.96 a day earlier.

Big gainers were led by Javed Omer, Sapphire Fibre, Attock
Refinery, Rupali Polyester, Dawood Hercules, Clariant Pakistan,
Pakistan Gum Chemicals, Murree Brewery, EFU Life Insurance, IGI
Insurance and Security Papers, which posted gains ranging from
Rs1.20 to Rs2.95.

Losers were led by PSO, Shell Pakistan, Siemens Pakistan, Burewala
Textiles and Nestle MilkPak, falling by Rs2.05 to Rs6.95, the
largest decline being in Nestle MilkPak. Chashma Sugar, Dewan Sugar
and Engro Chemical also fell by Rs1.40 to Rs1.55 and so did some
others.

Trading volume was maintained on the higher side thanks to heavy
turnover in the pivotals totalling 263m shares as gainers held a
fair lead over the losers at 107 to 92, out of the 238 actives.

PTCL topped the list of most actives, up 40 paisa at Rs19.55 on
110m shares followed by Hub-Power, also up by the same amount at
Rs29.50 on 77m shares, Sui Northern, firm by 15 paisa at Rs14 on
16m shares, PSO, off Rs2.25 at Rs146.25 on 15m shares and FFC-
Jordan Fertiliser, steady by five paisa at Rs5.60 on 10m shares.

Fuaji Fertiliser followed them, firm by 10 paisa on 6.356m shares,
National Bank, up 25 paisa on 4.220m shares, KESC, lower 25 paisa
on 3.480m shares, ICI Pakistan, off 50 paisa on 2.696m shares and
Maple Leaf Cement, up 60 paisa on 2.532m shares.

FUTURE CONTRACTS: Forward counters showed easy trend where leading
shares notably, ICI Pakistan, PSO and Engro Chemical came in for
active selling and finished with losses ranging from 45 paisa to
Rs1.55, the largest Rs2.10 being in PSO at Rs145.90. Engro Chemical
fell by Rs1.45 at Rs72.70.

Hub-Power again proved one of the most active scrips, up 20 paisa
at Rs26.05 on 4.750m shares. The interesting feature was that the
spread between the ready and forward rates widened to Rs3.45,
giving a massive manoeuvring leverage to investors for rolling of
either-way positions.

PTCL was also actively traded in line with its ready delivery and
rose by 45 paisa at Rs19.65 on 5.774m shares.

DEFAULTER COMPANIES: Shares of three companies came in for modest
support under the lead of Automotive Battery, up five paisa at
Rs5.00 on 2,000 shares followed by Pangrio Sugar, unchanged at
Rs1.00 on 1,000 shares and Mehran Jute, lower 25 paisa at Rs0.25 on
500 shares.

DIVIDEND: Shadman Cotton cash 20 per cent, Nagina Cotton 25 per
cent, Premier Sugar 37.5 per cent and Ellcot Spinning 20 per cent.

a shortage but of potential Napoleons we obviously have none.

Once upon a time (how long ago it seems) generals were a rarity in
the Pakistan army, figures of awe and not a little mystique.
Nowadays, as the long line of cars streaming out of General
Headquarters in Rawalpindi at close of day so eloquently testifies,
they are close to becoming a demographic wonder. How many are they
in all?

Of four-star generals, the heaviest artillery going, the Pakistan
army has three: the Chief himself, Gen Aziz and Gen Yousaf.
Lieutenant generals, over 25 (at last count 29, including several
doctors). Major generals, over a hundred. No doubt some retire but
like the national birth-rate is more than the economic growth rate,
promotions outstrip retirements.

Moreover, since soldiers never die, and in Pakistan they do not
even fade away, a general's retirement does not mean his being put
out to grass. A hundred sinecures ensure his profitable re-
employment. A look into the masonic underworld of retired generals
holding grimly on to top positions in government and semi-
government organizations would make a fascinating subject for a
doctoral thesis.

Of course a large body of troops requires an adequate number of
commanders. If my counting is correct we have 14 armoured brigades
and 19 infantry divisions. Which makes for a large army. Even so, a
hundred and twenty generals of all stripes would beggar any
military force, no matter how large. How many generals did Hitler
have? How many the Red Army? Proportion-wise I am sure we beat both
these examples hollow.

The air force and navy do not lag behind in this respect. At one
time the air force was happy with one air marshal (Asghar Khan) and
Pakistan Airlines with another (Nur Khan). In Ayub Khan's time the
navy got by with a rear admiral (A. R. Khan). Nowadays getting an
accurate count of all the air marshals, air vice marshals, admirals
and rear admirals strutting about in uniform would qualify as a
major undertaking.

Real command positions being few, it is no wonder if more and more
senior officers on the active list are looking for lucrative jobs
in other government organizations. For the past three years Wapda
is being run by what is virtually a corps formation. The boss is a
lieut gen (a genial and helpful man but that is beside the point).
The various sectors are under the command of brigadiers. Ogdc is
the same--serving officers filling the most important jobs. Indeed
serving and retired military officers are everywhere including the
Federal Public Service Commission and the Punjab Public Service
Commission, both headed by retired military officers. The Railways
have not been spared. Nor the hapless Post Office, one of the last
remaining success stories of Pakistan, which has passed into the
care of a retired maj gen.

Even the fresh list of major generals makes for instructive
reading. Of the 15 who have so far received posting orders, nearly
half have got command appointments in the fighting arms while the
rest have been posted in such places as Military Land and
Cantonments, the Accountability Bureau, the Research Wing of the
National Defence College and, yes, the real centre of power, the
Chief Executive's Secretariat. An army of course needs desk jobs
but the impression here is of excuses being found to accommodate an
ever-increasing mass of brass. Who is serving whom? The military
serving the country or the country at the service of the military?

No doubt all bureaucracies are greedy and tenacious, their instinct
being to proliferate and suck life out of other organisms. But the
bureaucratization of the military leaves even the earlier exploits
of the CSP cadre in the shade. No longer is the military relying on
the bureaucracy for advice and the implementation of policy. It is
doing everything itself, both macro and micro-management (apart
from financial matters which it does not understand). As a result,
the old mandarin-military coalition which dominated Pakistan's
skyline lies broken. With the babus eclipsed (and good riddance to
them) the military is sole arbiter of national affairs.

>From this hegemony three questions arise. First, what makes the
military think it has a monopoly on wisdom and competence? History
certainly lends no support to this illusion, major disasters having
struck the country during military rule. Nor is this fiction
supported by current performance.

Speed and decisiveness are the only things that justify military
rule. Steps which slow-moving civilian rulers balk at, a military
strongman takes. This is the theory. This the example of Alexander
who when told at Delphi that he who 'untied' the Gordian Knot would
rule the world, simply 'slashed' it with his sword.

In two-and-a-half years Napoleon had reformed the administration of
France and conquered half of Europe. In two and a half years
Ataturk had expelled the Greek army from Turkish soil and laid the
foundations of modern Turkey. In two and a half years Hitler's
armies stood at the gates of Moscow and Leningrad. In two and a
half years what have Pakistan's lieutenant and major generals - all
one hundred and twenty of them--accomplished?

Rhetoric of reform aside, Pakistan is much the same place as
General Musharraf discovered when he seized power. Little has
changed: not the judicial system, not the legal system, the police
system or the education and health systems. To be sure, the foreign
policy agenda has shifted, mainly because of external pressure. But
the life of the ordinary Pakistani remains much as before, living
on hope and feeding on false promises. What does the government
then have to show for the time it has been in power?

The second question has to do with the military's effectiveness as
a fighting force. Do officers who get a taste of civilian life,
with its perks and privileges, remain fit to command troops in the
field? Does their fighting spirit remain unimpaired? Soldiering is
a hard profession which requires single-minded devotion. Nothing
blunts it so much as civilian distractions. Just as a conflict of
interest leads to bad ethics, a conflict of purpose leads to bad
soldiering.

So many generals on the active list, a battalion of generals on the
retired list, serving and retired officers seeking jobs and good
housing: this is a vast system of perks and privileges. A poor
nation cannot afford this. If it affords this, it must forgo other
things, usually education and health for the masses. The necessity
of an effective fighting force is not in question. A predatory
neighbourhood leaves us with no other choice. The point is
altogether different: can we afford a cake whose icing is heavier
than the rest of the cake?

Can the frontiers of military privilege be rolled back? Can
military expenses come under public scrutiny? It seems unlikely
because no class likes losing its privileges, least of all a class
holding a monopoly of coercive power. So the third question arises
which relates to democracy. Can democracy survive, let alone
prosper, in such a climate? A strong and growing military caste
jealously guarding its privileges and a vibrant, self-confident
democracy are antithetical concepts.

That is why it takes no clairvoyant to see that what we are headed
for is an experiment in Indonesian democracy: where the president,
anchored firmly in his military constituency, calls the shots while
prime minister and parliament walk dutifully in his shadow. We have
been here before. Since we are again preparing to revisit familiar
haunts, these are not happy tidings for the future.

<a name="isth">Is the US becoming a 'rogue' state?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Eric S. Margolis

'The world now thinks the US has lost its mind.' This response to
President George Bush's bombastic state of the union address did
not come from 'axis of evil' Iraq, Iran, or North Korea, but from
former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She is dead right.

America's allies and friends were initially reluctant to openly
criticize Bush's Philippic, but in recent days the president's
aggressive, triumphalist policies have come under fierce attack
around the world, and particularly so in Europe.

France's normally cautious foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, called
Bush's views on terrorism 'simplistic.' He warned about Bush policy
that 'reduces all problems in the world to the struggle against
terrorism,' predicting Europe would go its own way if the US
maintained its policy of unilateralism.

More sharp criticism came from Germany, Italy, Spain, the EU, Asia
and US Mideast allies. Even Britain, America's most faithful
satrap, warned against attacking Iraq or Iran. South Korea's
government angrily blasted Washington for derailing efforts to
promote better relations with North Korea.

European leaders also took aim at American-Israeli efforts to
eclipse Yasser Arafat and crush Palestinian resistance. 'European
countries do not agree with the White House Middle East policy and
think it is a mistake to support Ariel Sharon's purely repressive
policies,' said Vedrine, speaking for the entire European Union.

Bush Administration spokesmen reject all foreign criticism.
Secretary of State Colin Powell increased war fever by blasting
Iran for 'meddling' in Afghanistan. This is rich, coming from the
US, which just invaded Afghanistan, overthrew its government,
installed a client regime in Kabul, and is setting up permanent
military bases there.

Threatening war against Iran for seeking to advance its interests
in neighboring Afghanistan shows just how irrational and imperially
arrogant the Bush Administration is becoming. India and Russia are
also deeply involved in Afghanistan; in fact, Russia has virtually
taken over the north. Yet there was not a peep from Washington
about these interlopers.

As part of the growing merging of policy between Washington and
Jerusalem, the Bush Administration's super-hawks have adopted two
longstanding Israeli arguments to justify aggressive actions.
First, 'we have suffered enormously. This gives us the absolute
right to attack anyone we deem a threat, including assassinating
potentially dangerous individuals.' Second, 'we are faced by a
mortal threat from terrorists. To hell with world, we'll do
precisely as we see fit. The UN, the EU, the Geneva Convention,
international law - all of them be damned.'

Fifty years of painful efforts to build a framework of
international law are being swept away by the Bush crusaders, who
seem to have convinced themselves that they are re-fighting World
War II rather than dealing with a dangerous criminal conspiracy
made up of a few thousand individuals.

Listening to the Bush people preach about the need to liberate
Iranians and Iraqis from oppression is Olympic-class hypocrisy. If
Bush really wanted to promote justice and human rights abroad, he
should begin with those nations that are American protectorates.

While most Americans continue to cheer Bush's bellicose, adolescent
rhetoric and crusading zeal, quiet opposition is developing,
particularly among the thinking classes. Given the current climate
of war fever, few Americans are ready to criticize government
actions.

<a name="dang">Dangerous liaisons</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

As we come to terms with the unfortunate Daniel Pearl's brutal and
cold-blooded murder, we should be honest enough to accept that a
major part of the blame must rest with our unstated but official
policy of permitting terrorists the run of the land.

Sheikh Omar Saeed, the main suspect and the self-confessed
organizer of the American journalist's kidnapping, was one of those
released from an Indian jail as part of the deal to end the 1999
hijacking of an Indian Airlines airliner. Having spent five years
in prison on a kidnapping charge, surely he was not somebody to
whom our government should have given sanctuary.

As a British citizen, he could simply have been deported to the
country of his birth without any legal complications. Had this
normal, civilized path been followed, Daniel Pearl might still have
been alive.

Another Indian prisoner who was released as a result of that
hijacking is Maulana Azhar Masood who, upon reaching Pakistan was
soon seen at public rallies (at a time political activities were
banned by the military government of General Musharraf), surrounded
by armed guards, fulminating against India and the United States.
Indeed, his strident threats soon drew a formal protest from
Washington. When his Harkatul Mujahideen was declared a terrorist
organization by the American State Department, he launched the
Jaish-i-Mohammad, the jihadi outfit that initially claimed credit
for the attack on the Kashmir assembly building in Srinagar last
September.

Had it not been for the events of September 11, he would have still
been running loose today, and the government would still have been
covertly sponsoring the Maulana and his ilk. As it is, he and
several hundred of his followers are in custody, but how long will
they stay there is not clear. Several dozen extremists were
released recently for 'lack of evidence', so it is entirely likely
that Maulana Azhar will soon be free. It seems that preaching
hatred is not enough to convict anybody. There is already talk
about releasing most of the two thousand zealots arrested a few
weeks ago in the wake of General Musharraf's 'historic' speech.

I have just finished reading "Holy War, Inc" by Peter Bergen, a
fascinating account of Osama Bin Laden and his al Qaeda, as well as
sundry Islamic terrorist organizations. As a Pakistani, I found it
deeply troubling to read how much this country has become an
integral part of the global terrorist nexus.

Although hardly surprising, given the events of the last couple of
decades, the author details the comings and goings of dozens of
Arab and other foreign terrorists to Afghanistan and Pakistan. On
several visits to Afghanistan, he discovers that thousands of
Pakistanis were fighting alongside the Taliban, and hundreds more
were being trained in al Qaeda camps.

Surely none of this could have taken place without the full
knowledge and connivance of successive Pakistani governments.
Firstly, tourist visas were given to all kinds of shady characters
who had been in and out of the country on many occasions. Most of
these people travelled to Afghanistan from Peshawar without let or
hindrance. Hundreds of young Pakistani men went across the border
when it was common knowledge that they were going for training in
camps operated by al Qaeda, as well as to fight against the
Northern Alliance. If the present Afghan government feels aggrieved
against Pakistan, it is with good reason for we helped prolong the
civil war next door.

According to a brief paper on terrorism in Pakistan circulated by
the American Information Resource Centre of the US Consulate-
General in Karachi, "... Pakistan's intelligence services - known
as the Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI - have provided covert
but well-documented support to terrorist groups fighting against
India in the disputed territory of Kashmir..." The report goes on
to say: "... The New York Times reported in October 2001 that ISI
had an 'indirect but longstanding' relationship with al Qaeda and
has used al Qaeda camps to train operatives for terrorist attacks
against India..."

But we don't really need the American Consulate to tell us these
unpleasant home truths: our media has been covering these realities
for years. A year or so ago, the monthly Newsline ran a cover story
giving details of training camps being run for jihadis in Punjab
and the Frontier province. Outfits like the Lashkar-i-Tayaba and
the Jaish-i-Mohammad, to name only two, have been openly collecting
funds for the 'Kashmir jihad'.

When a state permits and encourages the training of its young men
to take part in illegal military operations abroad, it should
expect these terrorists to target its enemies within its borders as
well. This is specially true when these groups accuse the state of
not being sufficiently 'Islamic', and hence a legitimate target.
The surge of sectarian and religious violence we have witnessed
over the last decade is a direct result of the encouragement the
militants have received from state institutions.

General Musharraf's U-turn in the government's attitude towards
jihad and jihadis is more a declaration of intent than a call to
arms against these organizations. So far, those militants who have
been locked up have not been charged. Indeed, it is not clear what
offence they can be charged with, other than being members of
outfits that have now been banned. The recent slaughter of ten
Shias in a mosque in Rawalpindi is a chilling reminder about the
power of these sectarian groups and the weakness of the state in
confronting them.

Terrorism flourishes where the writ of the state is neither
enforced nor respected. It is no coincidence that countries like
Afghanistan, Pakistan and Yemen are considered as safe havens for
groups like al Qaeda. When the laws of the land are ignored by both
citizens and those charged with their enforcement, a vacuum of
authority is created and quickly filled by criminals of every kind
ranging from drug smugglers to a wide range of terrorists. Thus,
there are around 1500 kidnappings in Yemen every year. Heroin and
marijuana are an integral part of Pakistan's underground economy.
And food convoys are being routinely looted in Afghanistan.

In order to restore the writ of the state, tough decisions have to
be taken and implemented. Pious intentions are not enough. Although
Pakistan's many holy warriors are currently subdued after the
Taliban's abject surrender, it is only a matter of time before they
reassert themselves. Their cause in Afghanistan is lost, and they
will soon turn their attention to Kashmir, despite General
Musharraf's reversal of policy about supporting the jihad.

The root cause of so many of our policies that haunt us today is
the Kashmir conflict; the sooner we resolve it, the sooner we can
return to a normal existence.

<a name="auss">Aussie officials play down security concerns</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, March 1: The Australian Cricket Board (ACB) played down
security concerns in Pakistan but admitted that September's ICC
Champions Trophy would take the chunk out of October's tour.
"Pakistan is no different from anywhere in the world. We don't
treat Pakistan as any different from Sri Lanka or England or South
Africa," ACB's operations chief Richard Watson told reporters at
the National Stadium.

"We don't pick one country from another. Every country is treated
the same. Everywhere the Australian team now plays, we send our
representatives to do a pre-tour visit," Watson said.

Tim May, the chief executive of the Australian Players Association,
said: "This is normal that some places are different from others.

"There is no feedback from the ACB and we are here to take the
feedback," he said, adding: "We are here for one day and are very
impressed with everything that is set." The three-man ACB
delegation arrived and inspected the facilities at the National
Stadium. The visitors will gauge the players facilities, training,
food and security of the players - off and on the field - at
Faisalabad, Multan, Sheikhupura, Lahore besides Karachi.

New Zealand cancelled their tour in September while the West Indies
refused to tour Pakistan but honoured its commitment in Sharjah.
"We are doing our pre-tour check on the basis that the tour will go
ahead and once the facilities and security of our players is
confirmed, there will be no cause of concern for us," Watson said.

May said Australian captain Steve Waugh, who has vehemently
advocated for players security, had no specific thoughts about the
tour. "He (Steve Waugh) knows my position as chief executive of the
ACA and understands that I would look at all the aspects."
Nevertheless, Watson agreed that the ICC Champions Trophy would
affect the tour schedule.

"The ICC Champions Trophy has taken the whole chunk out of what
would normally be our touring time. We have to arrange with the PCB
to fit in our criterion of matches - three Tests and one-dayers.
"If we can fit three Tests and three or five one-dayers, that's
what we would do. The schedule is tight but we will do our best,"
Watson said.

The ICC Champions Trophy is proposed between Sept 13 and 30 at Sri
Lanka while the first Ashes Test begins from Nov 7. That
practically leaves only 39 days between the two events in which
Australia and Pakistan will try to squeeze the series.

The Pakistan Cricket Board plans a double league tri-series also
involving New Zealand. Watson, unlike the NZC, said his board
trusted the PCB and would not demand for additional assurances from
the government on players security.

<a name="wasi">Wasim Raja in match referees panel</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, March 1: Pakistan's Wasim Raja was named in the
International Cricket Council's match referees panel that was
released. India's Gundappa Viswanath, South African Mike Proctor
and West Indian Clive Lloyd also earned two-year full time
contracts with the ICC. Sri Lankan Ranjan Madugalle is the fifth
official who is also the chief referee.

The panel comes into effect from April 1. There are three Asians in
the panel and if Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is to
be trusted, Proctor is also part of the Asian alliance. However,
Wasim's appointment came out of the blue as the former Test star
was neither Pakistan's representative in the defunct panel nor ever
served as match referee in country's domestic circuit.

Wasim played in 57 Tests and 54 one-day internationals for
Pakistan. He was also appointed Pakistan coach for a brief period
in 1999. Wasim was selected ahead of Naushad Ali and Talat Ali who
served as Pakistan's representative in the outgoing match referees
panel.

The five were selected out of 30 nominations the 10 Test playing
countries had sent. The list was finalized by ICC chief executive
Mal Speed and Sunil Gavaskar (ICC cricket management committee-
playing) after Madugalle had trimmed the tally of candidates to 12.
The ICC will release the eight members of the elite panel of
umpires on March 4.

PCB DELIGHTED

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was delighted with the selection
of its candidate in the match referees panel and said the game's
controlling body have proved that it was a neutral body. The
chairman of the PCB, Lt Gen Tauqir Zia, further said from
Rawalpindi that it was very nice of the ICC to include Wasim Raja.

"Wasim was a late inclusion. We added his name after we came to
know that he was free in the next two years. But I must thank the
ICC that they considered Wasim for selection and eventually picked
him," Tauqir said. He added: "I am delighted and happy because now
there is a Pakistani in the mainstream of the ICC.

"It shows the neutrality of the ICC. It has shown that the origin
of the candidate is of no consequence when it comes to picking the
best men for the toughest jobs." Tauqir, who is also the chairman
of the Asian Cricket Board (ACC), hoped that the latest ICC
decision would help defuse the tension between the two
establishments. "We have never challenged the authority of the ICC.
It is the supreme body and we respect and trust it.

<a name="axew">Pakistan axe Wasim for Asian final</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 26: Barely 24 hours after Allan Donald announced his
retirement from Test cricket, the end of an illustrious career of
another great name of the game was signalled when Pakistan
selectors dropped Wasim Akram from the Asian Test Championship
final against Sri Lanka.

The match will be played at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium between March
6 and 10. In an another surprise decision, the selectors overlooked
wrist spinner Danish Kaneria but named two finger spinners in
Shoaib Malik and Saqlain Mushtaq.

Danish has 32 wickets in seven Tests. But in the last two Tests, he
picked up three wickets while his 25 wickets have come in three
Tests against Bangladesh. "Shahid Afridi is a utility wrist spinner
and can be used," a PCB spokesman said. Interestingly, that theory
was not followed until Afridi was picked for the second Test
against the West Indies (after missing eight matches) in which he
scored a century and picked up a few wickets.

Wasim's exclusion is the third biggest cricket news this month.
Earlier, Steve Waugh was sacked as Australia's one-day captain and
Donald decided to hang in boots after hobbling off the ground in
the first Test between Australia and South Africa.

Wasim, who had made himself available for the match, was not in the
country to hear the news of his dropping. But when the news gets to
him, he would only blame his lack of form and fitness that has
deserted him in the last couple of years. Wasim, the 36-year-old
veteran has 414 Tests and 447 one- day wickets missed the final
Test against England in 2000 because of hamstring injury and then
skipped the three-Test series against New Zealand two months later.

He made a lacklustre comeback against England in England and then
went wicketless in the Asian Test Championship match against
Bangladesh at Multan. He made it for the tour to Bangladesh earlier
this year but his trip was restricted to just 20 balls before he
limped off with a hamstring injury.

In the last six Tests, Wasim has captured just seven wickets, which
confirms the fact that the Sultan of Reverse Swing has surely past
his brilliant best. It has been an amazing turn-around for Wasim
who captured successive hat tricks against Sri Lanka - at Lahore
and Dhaka - when the two teams clashed in the inaugural
championship in 1999.

The selectors retained Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami and also named
Mohammad Zahid whose comeback to international cricket was derailed
with the sad demise of his father. He had to return from Sharjah
after joining the team a day later owing to delay in completion of
his travel formalities.

However, Pakistan captain Waqar Younis disagreed that the world had
seen Wasim for the last time in Tests. "He is a great cricketer and
still has (Test) cricket left in him. He has not been picked solely
because he lacks fitness.

"It's a one-off Test against Sri Lanka but I am sure if Wasim
regains complete fitness and form, he would be back for the series
against New Zealand," Waqar said. Waqar hoped that the forthcoming
domestic one-day matches would help Wasim regain the lost magical
touch. Waqar further said the management has not decided to play
Wasim in selected matches. "If he is fit, he will play in Tests and
one-dayers."

However, the chairman of the PCB Lt Gen Tauqir Zia said Wasim was
being saved for next year's World Cup starting Feb 9. Pakistan
plays opener against Australia at Johannesburg on Feb 11. "We are
saving him for the World Cup. A lot of cricket has to be played
upto the World Cup but we will include him in crunch and selective
matches," he said. The PCB chairman added that Wasim's Test career
was far from over. The chairman of selectors, Wasim Bari was
unavailable for comments.

<a name="arge">Argentina stun Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Imran Naeem Ahmad

KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 28: Pakistan failed in what was their first real
World Cup test losing 1-2 to Argentina on the fifth day of the
tournament. Despite defending champions Netherlands and Spain doing
them a favour by drawing their game 1-1, Pakistan slipped to fourth
in the tough Pool A. The defeat left Pakistan with nine points from
four games, making their task of qualifying for the semi-finals
more difficult.

Their remaining games are now against top teams in the group
Netherlands, runner-up of the 1998 World Cup Spain and title-
favourites Germany who leap-frogged to third place with a 3-0
victory against win-less Belgium.

Argentina's Matias Paredes dealt the body blow to Pakistan late in
the game, sending a shot past goalkeeper Muhammad Qasim to seal a
memorable victory over the four-time champions. Pakistan seized a
timely lead, Sohail Abbas shooting in from a short corner for his
fifth goal of the tournament. However Argentina then launched a
series of attacks forcing a number of penalty corners with marksman
Jorge Lombi making several attempts all of which did not produce
any goals.

Aregntina stepped up the pressure in the second half and were duly
rewarded with a goal from Tomas MacCormik before Paredes pushed in
the match-winner. Pakistan made desperate attempts in search of the
equalizer earning two late penalty corners but Sohail Abbas could
not save his side from defeat.

Although manager Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar used the cliche of
"missed chances", the primary reason for Pakistan's loss was that
their forwards did not click and seemed to lack commitment.

Shahbaz Ahmed, 34, who Pakistan still hope can help them get
through, made a few dangerous runs spraying several defence
splitting passes, only to see his ending in frustration. Midfielder
Waseem Ahmed had an outstanding match and worked really hard.

Argentina's coach, Jorge Ruiz, whose side had 12 short corners all
of them not utilized, joked at the post-match news conference that
it could be some sort of a record. "We wanted to win this game and
I am happy that we won." The Pakistan manager felt that his boys
did "alright" and added that it was a good competition. "Argentina
did very well, we had our chances but then a 1-0 lead is nothing."

Champions Netherlands who drew with Spain stayed at the top of
Group A with 10 points from four matches on goal difference. The
Dutch scored first through Karel Klaver in field play with 21
minutes gone but Spain bounced back with a 55th minute equalizer
from Jordi Quintana.

Spain, also with 10 points are second in the pool with Germany, who
beat Belgium, in third place. The European champions put in two
goals with Sebestian Biederlack and Sascha being on target in the
first half. Then a late third goal was scored by Bjorn Michel.
After four matches, Belgium remained without a point in the
tournament.

In another game New Zealand collected their first points in Pool A
with a 2-1 defeat of South Africa who are still to score a win.
After the Kiwis scored early in the first session, a goal from
captain Simon Towns, South Africa hit back to level the scores on
the stroke of half-time. New Zealand's winner came on the 59th
minute through a short corner. South Africa remain without a
victory after four matches.

<a name="aler">Alert Qasim comes to Pakistan's rescue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Imran Naeem Ahmad

KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 27: Pakistan continued their chase for a place in
the semi-finals of the World Cup thanks largely to veteran Shahbaz
Ahmed chipping in his first goal of the tournament and the heroics
of Mohammed Qasim under the bar for a 2-0 victory over pointless
New Zealand. But the win was unimpressive. The four-time champions
failed to score in the first half of play.

It required a determined 39th minute effort from Shahbaz for
Pakistan to step up a gear after a 'boring' opening session. The
34-year-old star of the 1994 World Cup, brought in all the
experience to flick in a Kashif Jawad pass while Khalid Saleem
scored Pakistan's second, his shot from the left deflecting into
the net off a defender's stick.

Although Pakistan picked up three more points they would have to
raise their game considerably as they bid to win the tournament for
a record fifth time.

There was nothing much in the first half in which both sides forced
a short corner each, with Sohail Abbas being blocked from a 23rd
minute set-piece. Minutes before, at the other end, goalkeeper
Muhammad Qasim was called upon to make a spectacular save off a
penalty corner shot taken by Hayden Shaw, rapidly developing into a
reliable short corner striker.

While the first half was listless there were some good moves in the
second half. After Shahbaz opened the scoring, the Kiwis went
defensive for a good while. But they woke up after going 2-0 down
and forced three penalty corners, two of them going wide and Qasim
springing into action to save the third. The New Zealanders could
have equalised on the 45th when Ryan Archibald's hit deflected onto
the cross bar.

With the forwards not making any impression, it was Qasim, who
stood out with his spectacular saves. The talented net-minder is
indeed fast becoming a life-saver for Pakistan.

KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 25: Pakistan, powered by a brace each from Atif
Bashir and Sohail Abbas, routed South Africa 5-0 for a cracking
start to the 10th men's World Cup Hockey Tournament. The four-time
champions after some initial hiccups that saw South Africa nearly
score with the game barely 10 minutes old, got their act together
and went one up, Atif Bashir chipping in from close range.

Returning to the team after missing the six-nation tournament here
in January, the professional doctor was set up by captain Muhammad
Sarwar who had weaved his way through with precision. Sohail Abbas,
Pakistan's top short corner striker put in the second on the 39th
minute to make the score look more respectable from his side's
second short corner.

Muhammad Shabbir sent in a rocket after combining well with Khalid
Saleem on the 54th minute while Atif sprang into action again to
score the fourth, result of some work done by Khalid on the left
flank.

An intelligent short corner drill earned Pakistan their fifth, with
Sohail firing in again. The South Africans, competing in only their
second World Cup after Sydney 1994, had looked good early on in the
game and came close to scoring at least four times. Their best
chance came at the start of play, their forward Greg Nicol hitting
the cross bar. The dangerous Nicol, got quite a few more chances
but some good keeping by Pakistan goalkeeper Muhammad Qasim spoiled
their efforts.

Pakistan manager Khalid Sajjad Khokhar terming the victory as
'satisfying' said the boys needed to put in more in the matches
ahead, the most immediate being the game against Belgium. He
conceded that defenders Tariq Imran and Sohail Abbas gave South
African forwards room to attack. "There were some lapses on their
part but since this was the first game, I am sure they'll settle
down quickly."

Shahbaz Ahmed, the architect of Pakistan's victory in the Sydney
World Cup, had a quiet game. Wearing sixties-style shorts, he did
make a couple of dangerous runs that unsettled the South African
defence.

"Shahbaz was an average player today but still he did what was
expected of him." he added. Pakistan, wary that it might come down
to goal average in the end, did well in firing home five although
they could have added at least two more but for some scrappy
finishing in front of goal.
