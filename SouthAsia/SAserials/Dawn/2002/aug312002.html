ISLAMABAD, Aug 30: The government has announced that all Pakistanis 
who are now citizens of the United States shall have dual 
nationality, a press release of the Ministry of Interior says.

The government has realized the difficulties and sense of 
deprivation among the Pakistanis who had acquired the American 
citizenship and in due course lost the Pakistani citizenship by 
virtue of the Pakistan Citizenship Act.

<a name="paki">Pakistan has evidence of air attack, says ISPR chief</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: The government told US Deputy Secretary of State 
Richard Armitage during his visit that the Indian air strikes on a 
Pakistani military post along the Line of Control last week were 
verifiable, informed sources said.

ISPR Director-General Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi told Dawn "We have 
evidence, and we are trying to get over it." He also indicated that 
Pakistan would soon unveil 'convincing evidence', but avoided 
giving specifics about it.

Sources attending talks with Mr Armitage said he had inquired about 
the attack during parleys with the officials here. He was on his 
way to New Delhi at the time of air strike. "He did not seem too 
clear or sure about it; he wanted to know more from us, so he was 
briefed by Foreign Affairs Minister Inamul Haq," said an official 
who attended the meeting.

Another source privy to the talks said it transpired during the 
discussions with Mr Armitage that there was a lot of confusion in 
the Indian official circles on the question of attack that Pakistan 
had claimed to have had repulsed.

The sources said Mr Armitage taking serious note of the incident 
had described the unprovoked air attack as 'irresponsible 
escalation'.

While the Indians continued to officially deny their escalatory 
move, they told Mr Armitage at the ministerial-level that something 
had happened at the LoC, Dawn learnt through well-placed diplomatic 
sources in Islamabad.

Gen Rashid Qureshi announced at a Press Conference on Friday that 
India had suffered heavy casualties after it had launched an 
unprovoked air attack on a Pakistani post in Gultari. India 
dismissed the claim by Pakistan as an 'outright lie'.

Interestingly, Star News and another Indian TV channel initially 
had quoted some defence sources as privately conceding that 
something had happened in which air power had been used. But later 
they aired the Indian spokesman version.

<a name="noin">No intention to grab power, says Musharraf</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 29: President Pervez Musharraf has said that the 
recent constitutional changes were not aimed at strengthening his 
position ahead of the general election in October. "This is a total 
misperception of whatever I am trying to do," he said in an 
interview with the BBC.

"I know the politicians say that, and the media, but nothing could 
be further from the truth."

The president also admitted Al Qaeda activists were operating in 
Pakistan.

"To a degree it causes anxiety because they (Al Qaeda) are coming 
into the cities... that is bad because they carry out 
destabilisation so yes, this is a worrisome act. "But I don't think 
it's widespread. I think they are more on the borders if at all 
they are there."

He added: "I can't specify the involvement in the terrorist acts. 
There is no surety as yet - there are some indications that maybe 
there was some foreign element involved ... but this is more our 
own extremists, I think."

EX-PREMIERS: To a question about former prime ministers, Gen 
Musharraf said no "sane" person would want either of the former 
prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto back in power. Both 
are barred from another term in office under new electoral rules.

"This nation has had these two for 11 years ... why should any sane 
person, why should one allow them to participate in this election?

"Should we take a chance that they should come back and again one 
of them become the prime minister?"

He defended the National Security Council, and denied he was trying 
to grab more power. "If I was to take power for myself, as a 
person, I would not make the National Security Council," he said. 
"I would just remove the 13th amendment and I would have the power 
to dismiss the assembly. "Why would I want 12 people to sit with me 
and decide that?"

Musharraf said the changes to the structure of government were 
forward-looking improvements. "This was futuristic because I am not 
a permanent feature of this country," he said. "Somebody else is 
going to become President some time in future who may be an 
impulsive man, over-reacting when things are not going wrong. So it 
was an endeavour to address such issues keeping in mind the 
environment in Pakistan that these amendments were evolved, he 
said.

He said: "Democracy does not have a set formula. The democracy in 
Britain's way is not received here. We need to adopt it to our own 
environment."

KASHMIR ISSUE: Responding to a question on Kashmir, he said: "I 
have said that nothing is happening across the Line of Control" But 
of course one could imagine that unless there is some progress or 
movement on Kashmir, some response, some reciprocation from the 
Indian side, how can one know that there is a lot of sympathy for 
Kashmiris here, lot of international support for Kashmiris, the 
president said.

ATTACK ON IRAQ OPPOSED: President Gen Pervez Musharraf warned the 
United States that it risked fresh turmoil in the Islamic world if 
it attacked Iraq. "This would have very negative repercussions 
around the Islamic world," Musharraf said.

"It is already dangerous that all political disputes at the moment 
all around the world are unfortunately involving Muslims," he said. 
"Muslims are feeling that they are on the receiving end everywhere. 
So there is a feeling of alienation in the Muslim world and I think 
this will lead to further alienation."

"We are on their side," Musharraf said of Washington. "But that 
does not mean we can start participating in activities all around 
the world. Let's deal with whatever is happening around our 
country."

He predicted greater Islamic militancy in Pakistan if Iraq came 
under fire.

The President said invading Iraq would increase support for Osama 
and trigger a huge increase in anti-American sentiment. He said the 
region had enough on its hands already, and could not afford to get 
involved in anything else.

OSAMA: Musharraf said he did not know the fate of Osama bin Laden 
and added his best guess was that Osama was dead but that either 
way he would expect to know if he was hiding on the Pakistan side 
of its border with Afghanistan. "Most likely he's dead," he said. 
"Most likely. It's a guess. I can't say." He said Osama was 
definitely not in Pakistan.

"The Al Qaeda leader's large contingent of bodyguards and the price 
on his head would certainly have led to the alarm being raised as 
soon as he crossed the border," Gen Musharraf said.

He said Al Qaeda itself had been dealt a mortal blow. "I don't 
think they can develop an infrastructure of the kind that existed 
before, specially, if there is stability in Afghanistan," he said. 

He dismissed, as "a perception in the media", claims that the 
United States wanted him to act more decisively against Al Qaeda.

"We are certainly assisting them all the way," he said. "We've 
suffered casualties."-Agencies

<a name="parl">Parliament can impeach president, says Ranjha</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 30: Federal Law Minister Dr Khalid Ranjha rejected 
the notion that checks in the constitutional amendments were aimed 
only for the prime minister. He was responding to a question from 
audience at a special program on the amendments on BBC World's 
current affairs weekly program, Question Time Pakistan.

Former information minister and Millat Party Senior Vice-President 
Javed Jabbar, prominent lawyers, ex-federal law minister Barrister 
Khalid Anwar, constitutional experts and former Sindh governor 
Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim were other panelists.

Ranjha said: "Though the president has checks on prime minister, 
Parliament and the Supreme Court have checks on the president."

He said that under the Constitution, the prime minister was going 
to be the chief executive of the country. "Everything which is to 
be done is to be done by him", he noted.

The minister said the president had no power whatsoever apart from 
two things: He could appoint the army chief and he was chief of the 
army. Referring to the checks on the president, the minister 
pointed out that the parliament could impeach him. Ranjha said the 
Supreme Court could overturn the presidential order when he would 
exercise 58(2) B to sack prime minister or the government. This was 
another check on the president, he added.

But other panelists, including Javed Jabbar and Khalid Anwar, did 
not agree with the minister, and said he could sack the prime 
minister and the government before impeachment.

The minister said the concept of checks and balances had emerged 
after several measures had been tried in the past.

"We tried the 1956 Constitution. It did not work; it was 
parliamentary form. We tried 1952 Constitution, presidential form. 
It didn't work. We tried 1972 Constitution, again a presidential 
didn't work, then we had 1973 Constitution, again parliamentary and 
all the powers of president were given to the prime minister. It 
didn't work. Then we had a concept of checks and balances, and 
security council was conceived as a check and balance which was 
then deterred by the then law minister in 1996-97. That was in the 
form of law. Now we have the National Security Council in the shape 
of constitution", he said.

To another question, Dr Ranjha said the amendments were aimed at 
peaceful transition, and this was the mechanism of reverting back 
to civil government under the Constitution of 1973.

Javed Jabbar said it was the duty of forthcoming parliament to look 
into these amendments. He said 12 of these amendment were positive. 
They increased the size of the parliament. They gave them the right 
to represent. They increased the role in the financial 
independence, he added.-APP

<a name="begs">Beg sees president, parliament clash</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 30: Awami Qiadat Party chief Gen Aslam Beg (retired) 
sees a president-parliament clash after the elections. Speaking at 
a press conference on Friday, he said there would be a clash 
between a powerful president, who would have power of amendments 
and judiciary and army on his side, and parliament trying to be 
sovereign.

There would be no arbitrator between the two. This clash, if go 
unchecked, could harm the country and democracy. "If the US sides 
with the unelected forces, as it has always done, it will end up 
hurting the US interests in this part of the world." For this 
reason alone, the US must try to find a mid path and choose the 
next prime minister as its partner, the former chief of army staff 
said.

"The future of dictators is getting bleak world over and Pakistan 
may not prove to be an exception. The US must cultivate elected 
prime ministers, instead of army dictators, if it wants relations 
with Pakistan build on a permanent basis."

Gen Beg also predicted another constitutional crisis afflicting the 
post-election scenario. The Supreme Court did not clarify whether 
the Provisional Constitutional Order would continue after the 
elections or the constitution would be restored. Gen Pervez 
Musharraf could again go to the Supreme Court to clarify this 
point.

Gen Beg said that the forthcoming elections post-polls scenario 
would be a test for the PPP and the PML-N. "Both parties have their 
vote bank intact and will form majority in the next parliament, if 
elections are held fair and free. They must play their cards very 
carefully so that no harm is done to the interests of the country 
and democracy."

The former COAS said apparently, the country was going through a 
political mayhem. "There is good omen in this seemingly bad 
situation; voters now have a clear choice between forces of pro and 
against reforms.

"On the one hand, there are people who are supporting the present 
set up along with its future plans. Though it is a big group and 
enjoy the support of government, but it may end up having desirable 
majority in the parliament.

"On the other hand, there are forces who oppose these reforms and 
are fighting for a sovereign parliament. This clear choice presents 
positive sign of the present political confusion," he said.

This has also helped political leadership mature along democratic 
lines. "The PML-N and the PPP are in a process of making 
adjustments on seats which is a healthy sign, so is MMA."Gen Beg 
said that his party would join hands with these parties and 
contribute its share in stabilizing future political set-up.

The AQP, he said, expected to become a parliamentary party during 
this elections. Around 69 of its candidates - 12 for national 
assembly and 57 for four provincial assemblies - were contesting 
the forthcoming elections.

More candidatures were being processed and the list can swell by 
Sept 12, he claimed.

<a name="rule">Pakistan rules out US troop operation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: Pakistan said that there was no question to 
allow the US troops to operate on its soil to carry out search 
operations for any hideouts of Al Qaeda or the Taliban fugitives 
who might have escaped to Pakistani border areas from Afghanistan.

The commander of the US Central Command, Gen Tommy Franks, 
reportedly said in Kabul that he would continue his mission against 
(Al Qaeda and Taliban remnants) hideouts in Afghanistan and its 
surrounding countries "until it's all done".

Although he avoided saying anything about the specifics of his 
mission, he was further quoted to have said the "relationships that 
we have with the surrounding states around Afghanistan, would 
permit us to do our work that the (US) troops suggest needs to be 
done."

Asked at his weekly news briefing whether Gen Franks' reported 
statement imply that the US troops might have access into Pakistan 
territory in their operation against Al Qaeda and Taliban 
fugitives, the foreign office spokesman, Aziz Ahmad Khan, said he 
did not view the US commander's statement in that light.

Mr Khan said the question to permit American troops to operate on 
Pakistani soil did not arise (because) "Pakistani forces are fully 
capable of operating against any eventuality or terrorism or 
aggression". Pakistan's cooperation with the coalition forces in 
Afghanistan, he said, was confined to "sharing of intelligence" 
from the US as far as tracking down these people (the fugitives) 
was concerned. He stressed that President George Bush and other 
leaders had applauded Pakistan's role in this regard.

<a name="trib">Tribal people warn against US hunt for Al Qaeda men</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PESHAWAR, Aug 28: Residents of tribal border belt have warned that 
US troops will face attack if they launched a hunt in their semi-
autonomous tribal region for Al Qaeda fugitives.

Speculation that a US military operation was in the offing was 
sparked by US Central Command chief Gen Tommy Franks' comments in 
Afghanistan on Sunday that the Al Qaeda hunt needed to be expanded 
into neighbouring countries.

Hundreds of Al Qaeda fugitives and Osama bin Laden are believed by 
US and Afghan officials to be hiding in Pakistan's remote tribal 
belt.

"The tribal people will resist US troops," said Iqbal Hussain, a 
merchant in Kurram Agency, one of seven agencies that make up the 
zone where Afridi, Shinwari, Wazir, Malagwi, and Shalmani tribes 
live under their own laws. "They will blockade the routes, they may 
create hindrances in their way, they may attack them with rocket 
fire, maybe missile fire, and they may carry out hit-and-run 
(attacks), hide and seek," Mr Hussain told AFP.

"So when you have hide and seek it's like a guerilla war, hit and 
run."

Tribal leaders said Pakistani troops, who had never entered their 
region until late last year, were welcome, but US troops were not. 
"We do not want Americans in our area. The people are against 
direct operations by Americans," Haji Bazeer, a trader in Miranshah 
in North Waziristan Agency, told AFP.

"Tribals in this area decided in a traditional jirga that if the 
Pakistan army and paramilitary forces, with the help of tribal 
elders, launch any search operation the locals will cooperate. But 
they do not like Americans in their area."

FBI agents stationed in Miranshah earlier this year came under 
rocket attack five times, though none were hurt.

Mohammad Ali Wazir, a businessman in the South Waziristan Agency's 
Wana town, predicted "a strong reaction" if US troops went to the 
tribal area.

"The tribal people here will not like any such operation and they 
will fight whatever type of fight they can. They have no 
helicopters or sophisticated arms, but what they can do they will 
do. Because there's no Al Qaeda here, and if they're going to 
search it will be a big problem for us," he said-AFP

<a name="octo">October polls will be a farce: PPP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 30: The Pakistan People's Party termed rejection of Ms 
Benazir Bhutto's nomination papers from NA-207 as part of mala fide 
game plan of the government and vowed not to give a walkover to the 
"King's Party".

"It is the blackest day in the history of Pakistan and a great 
setback to the struggle of democratic forces.

"Rejection of Benazir Bhutto's papers has established that October 
elections will be a farce because the largest political party is 
not being allowed to contest the elections freely," said Mian Raza 
Rabbani, acting secretary general of the Pakistan People's Party, 
during a news conference at Bilawal House.

Flanked by other central leaders of the party, Mr Rabbani kept all 
options open and said the decision of the Returning Officer of NA-
207 at Larkana was not in accordance with law, nor did it meet 
requirements of the constitution and natural justice.

Asked whether boycott of elections was on the PPP card, Mr Rabbani 
said: "This will suit the regime that the PPP gives a walkover to 
PML(Q) and SDA. This question is premature. We have not yet 
exhausted all legal options as yet."

He said that today's decision exposed the double standards and 
anti-PPP specific decisions of the regime, especially when a day 
earlier in Lahore papers of Mian Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted 
and banished from the country, were accepted. He, however, made it 
clear that the PPP had welcomed the acceptance of Mian Nawaz 
Sharif's papers with the hope that all political leaders would have 
the right to contest elections.

Raza Rabbani said that the PPP's criticism should not be taken as 
if it was grudging acceptance of Mr Sharif's nomination. He 
declined to comment on the question whether acceptance of Sharif's 
nominations was part of any deal with the government.

He said it was part of the government agenda to keep Ms Bhutto out 
of electoral and political dispensation.

Mr Rabbani said Gen Pervez Musharraf had categorically stated on 
many occasions that he would not let Ms Bhutto return to power or 
contest elections.

He claimed that the government initiatives were aimed at keeping 
democratic and liberal forces, who are against fundamentalism and 
Talibanisation of Pakistan, out of the electoral process.

The acting secretary general of the PPP also referred to Ms 
Bhutto's petition in the Sindh High Court and said his party would 
"exhaust all legal and political options" and the future course of 
action would be clear during the next few days.

He hoped that the Benazir Bhutto would eventually be allowed to 
contest and vowed that his party would put up a strong resistance 
to undemocratic and anti-people measures of the regime.

Mr Rabbani listed, what he termed as Bhutto-specific laws, which 
include amendment in Section 31-A of NAB ordinance and said it was 
in conflict with the provisions of criminal law.

He also referred to the graduation condition for holding a public 
office and for preventing a person from becoming prime minister for 
a third time, conviction owing to absconsion, amendment in article 
63 and inclusion of clause (p). He said that this clearly proved 
the regime's mala fide intentions.

He also criticised the amendments in political parties act, 
especially in which it has been said that a person who cannot be a 
member of the parliament cannot lead a political party. In this 
context, he specially mentioned the CE's Order No.21.

He also explained the raison d'etre for the formation People's 
Party Parliamentarian following amendment in section 32 of the NAB 
ordinance.

President Sindh PPP Nisar Khuhro said the rulers have repeated the 
history of 1979 and has made restoration of democracy a far cry.

Syed Qaim Ali Shah, who was present with Aftab Shahban Mirani, and 
Taj Haider, said the LFO 2002 has put the country in the same 
situation in which Yahya Khan had plunged the country in the 1970 
which culminated in the separation of East pakistan. 

Munawar Suhrawardy claimed it had created great dangers for the 
federation.

Agha Siraj Durrani whose papers for the provincial seat from Garhi 
Yasin were rejected said the decision was in flagrant violation of 
the Supreme Court order which he claimed had set aside his 
conviction.

<a name="itsg">It's govt game, says Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Amanullah Ghilzai 

LONDON, Aug 30: The chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party, 
Benazir Bhutto, has termed the rejection of her nomination papers 
from Larkana "a part of a game plan" by the Musharraf government to 
divide the ARD.

In her reaction, she said here on Friday: "I will challenge this 
decision by the election commission and will wait for the result of 
my two other nomination papers filed for the October elections".

She accused the election commission of double standard by, what she 
said, allowing Nawaz Sharif to contest the elections though he was 
already convicted by the Supreme Court of Pakistan and rejecting 
her nomination papers on the grounds that she was accused of 
corruption though not convicted yet.

Ms Bhutto said the only conviction she had was of the absentia 
which, she said, was a new law and that this conviction was not a 
crime. "I know that the government wants to divide the opposition 
parties (and) that's why my nomination papers were rejected."

She warned the authorities that the PPP would keep its seat-to-seat 
adjustment policy with the Pakistan Muslim League (N) despite the 
rejection of her nomination papers. She said she was glad that Mr 
Sharif's nomination papers from Lahore were accepted. Ms Bhutto 
said she was indirectly in touch with Mr Sharif while her party is 
in direct contact with the PML (N).

LARKANA, Aug 30: The returning officer for NA-207 (Larkana-IV) on 
Friday rejected the nomination papers of PPP chairperson and former 
prime minister Benazir Bhutto, giving the reason that she had been 
convicted in three references of the National Accountability Bureau

Ayaz Soomro, president, District Bar Association, appeared on 
behalf of Ms Bhutto and prayed that when the forms of former prime 
minister Nawaz Sharif had been accepted, the nomination papers of 
Ms Bhutto should also be accepted. But over ruling his arguments, 
returning officer Akhlaque Hussain Larik, the additional sessions 
judge, Ratodero, rejected the forms of Ms Bhutto.

When contacted, the returning officer told Dawn that Ms Bhutto had 
been convicted in three NAB references and, therefore, she stood 
disqualified under Article 63(P) as amended by the Legal Framework 
Order 2002. He said further that similarly she was disqualified 
under Section 8-D, sub-section 2-clause (N) of ECO No: 7 of 2002.

Documents pertaining to the NAB references were available with the 
returning officer and those were 41/2001, 23/2000 and 26/2000. The 
references had been decided on May 21, 2002; July 7, 2002; and June 
9, 2001, respectively, he said. About the NAB documents available 
with him, the returning officer said that those were with him as Ms 
Bhutto had filed a petition (No B-147/2002) wherein she had 
challenged the vires of Section 31 of NAB ordinance.

Former deputy speaker of the National Assembly Dr (Mrs) Ashraf 
Abbasi, Ms Bhutto's political secretary Dr Safdar Abbasi and former 
Sindh minister for local bodies Haji Munawar Ali Abbasi were 
present when the decision rejecting the papers of Ms Bhutto came.

They later led a procession that converged on the press club here 
after marching through the main streets of the town. They told 
newsmen they would follow the legal course. Ayaz Soomro, advocate 
for Ms Bhutto, told Dawn that an appeal against the decision would 
be filed shortly.

He called it "double standard," saying Mr Sharif's forms were 
accepted though he too was a convict. Ms Bhutto had been informed 
in London of the matter, he added.

<a name="hear">Hearing of Benazir's petition put off</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 29: A full bench of the Sindh High Court adjourned the 
hearing of a constitutional petition filed by Ms Benazir Bhutto 
till Sept 11.

The full bench comprising Chief Justice Saiyed Saeed Ashhad, 
Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed, Justice Ghulam Rabbani, Justice Anwar 
Zaheer Jamali and Justice Musheer Alam, adjourned the petition on 
the request of PPP chairperson's attorney.

The former prime minister has challenged the government measures to 
keep her out of political dispensation and electoral process. The 
bench, however, did not accede to Ms Bhutto's attorney for staying 
scrutiny of her nomination papers until her petition was decided.

The full bench was constituted on the request of the government on 
the premise that in the matter vires of two laws and a 
constitutional amendment had been questioned.

AG Punjab Maqbool Elahi Malik had filed the application on behalf 
of the federation, in which he had prayed for a larger bench on the 
premise that questions of territorial jurisdiction, locus standi, 
and the entitlement of the petitioner to relief arise.

When the matter came up for hearing, Farooq H. Naek requested for 
adjournment because the leading counsel, Barrister Kamal Azfar had 
fallen sick and was not in a position to argue.

Attorney General for Pakistan Barrister Makhdoom Ali Khan did not 
oppose the adjournment, but he did not agree to the date sought by 
Ms Bhutto's counsel because of his commitment abroad. The AGP would 
not be in the country on Sept 5 as he would be leaving for abroad 
to represent Pakistan in an international moot.

Farooq H. Naek said even in the absence of AGP, the federation can 
be represented as the counsel for federation Maqbool Illahi Malik, 
any DAG and Prosecutor NAB would be present.

He said that once an adjournment has been sought, the urgency has 
been lost. If it is resumed on 5th, the time for scrutiny would 
expire.

The bench observed that the entire constitutional package has been 
challenged before Lahore High Court and it would not be appropriate 
for this bench to hear the matter as there could be two conflicting 
judgments.

Farook Naek submitted that the petitioner has also challenged NAB 
Ordinance's 31-A which is not the subject matter of the petition 
referred to by the bench. He contended that constitutional 
amendments do not cover this specifically and only wording 
"conviction by a competent court" is given. He also referred to 
objections raised, vis-a-vis amendments in article 63 (1) (p) of 
the constitution.

As there was dispute over timing, the AGP suggested Sept 11 as next 
date of hearing, and the court directed the counsel of both the 
sides to reassemble after tea break.

When they met, the bench in the chamber of the CJ, Sept 11 was 
finally fixed for the hearing of the petition by the same bench.

In the amended petition, Ms Bhutto has termed the Legal Framework 
Order as illegal and contended that amendments, especially in 
Article 63 (p) of the constitution, were mala fide and intended to 
keep the petitioner out of political dispensation.

The former prime minister has prayed for enforcement of the right 
to contest elections to NA-207 and has challenged government's 
measure to keep her out of political and electoral process.

These amendments were termed illegal and mala fide and outside the 
ambit of powers conferred by the Supreme Court in Zafar Ali Shah's 
case.

The exercise is aimed at seeking an order from the court, allowing 
the petitioner to contest elections and that her nomination papers 
should not be rejected until the disposal of this petition. 

It should be left to the voters once again to decide who should 
represent them.

<a name="stat">State counsel opposes Benazir's petition</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 29: Counsel for the federation has maintained that Ms 
Benazir Bhutto's petition is not maintainable because the 
petitioner is an absconder and a fugitive, and, therefore, cannot 
seek benefit in equity jurisdiction.

This is stated in the written reply to Ms Bhutto's contentions, 
filed in the Sindh High Court by counsel Maqbool Elahi Malik, who 
is also advocate-general, Punjab.

It is his contention that the matter being agitated through the 
present constitutional petition is already under consideration by 
the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench, where writ petitions are 
pending adjudication. These petitions challenge what is also being 
challenged through the present petitions and since the law and the 
courts abhor multiplicity of proceedings, this petition merits to 
be dismissed, he claimed.

He maintains that the petitioner wants the SHC to sit in judgment 
over an order passed by the Lahore High Court in writ petition No. 
26421/98 and to interpret the same. He claimed that the SHC lacks 
territorial jurisdiction to sit in judgment over an order of the 
Lahore High Court.

Considerations of equity and fair-play demand that the court should 
not exercise its equitable jurisdiction in favour of an 
absconder/fugitive from law, he claimed.

The fact that the apex court has twice upheld the dismissal of the 
petitioner's government on charges of corruption etc. is enough to 
belie the self-projection campaign unleashed through the present 
petition. The petitioner, while narrating events, has challenged 
section 31-A of the NAB Ordinance as also Article 8(d)2(n) of Chief 
Executive Order No.7, amended by Chief Executive Order No.21 of 
2002 as being malicious, discriminatory and arbitrary and has 
attributed abuse of legislative authority to the law-maker.

Counsel Malik has maintained that the petitioner wants to avoid 
punishment and likewise the court of competent jurisdiction, which 
is the National Accountability Court which in the present case had 
adjudged the petitioner guilty of an offence; therefore, it is not 
correct to say that the petitioner has not been connoted.

With regard to Ms Bhutto's conviction, the federation's counsel has 
submitted that by virtue of section 31-A, the court has convicted 
the petitioner and sentenced her to imprisonment on account of 
operation of the law in question.

It has also been averred in the petition that the petitioner has 
been disqualified without being convicted for any substantive 
offence. This, he said, is fallacious and unwarranted because the 
substantive offence for which the petitioner has been convicted, is 
the offence contained in Section 31-A of the NAB Ordinance.

The petitioner has maintained that she never absconded but went 
abroad with the permission of the court.

It was Maqbool Illahi's contention that since the NAB Ordinance 
contains Section 31-A, which was not there in the earlier 
Ordinance, it follows that the order of the Lahore High Court, 
whereby the petitioner was allowed to proceed abroad and whereby 
the trials were allowed to proceed in her absence, is no more in 
the field since it has been taken over by Section 31-A of the NAB 
ordinance.

He did not agree with the contention of petitioner that the guilt 
under section 31-A is determined by operation of law and not as a 
result of conviction.

With regard to the petitioner's contention that the impugned 
provisions are violative of Article 4 and 9 of the Constitution, 
the federation's counsel contended that the petitioner had over- 
looked the provision of Article 63(P) of the Constitution. Article 
63tP) provides that a person shall be disqualified if he is for the 
time being disqualified for election under any law, for the time 
being in force. Section 31-A of the of	the NAB Ordinance is such 
a law in force, and, therefore, this argument be consigned to the 
dustbin.

It would be important to mention here that Article 8 (d) 2(n) of 
Chief Executive Order 7 of 2002 has been introduced to bring the 
accused to the book. If the accused cannot face the trial, how and 
why should she be allowed to contest elections in the country?

The petitioner contends that section 31-A violates Article 175 of 
the Constitution insofar as it interferes with judicial functions 
to be performed by the court, in accordance with the Cr.P.C. But 
the counsel for the federation disagreed wit the contention and 
said that while dealing with the similar arguments about section 
17-C of the NAB Ordinance, the Supreme Court has held in the 
Asfandyar Wali's case that no vested rights exist in the matters of 
procedure.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 28: Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto has asked 
the Chief Election Commissioner, Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, to take 
notice of the of violation of election laws by the government to 
rig the elections.

She drew the attention of the CEC to the suggestions by the PPP to 
the government to induct a national consensus government to ensure 
a fair administration; transfer power to the judiciary for the 
holding of elections as in Bangladesh; replace the politically-
motivated officials with neutral ones.

Bhutto, in a letter addressed to the CEC, has referred to the 
report published in South Asia Tribune dated Aug 26.

"I draw your attention to the report in the South Asian Tribune 
(Aug 26-Sept 1, 2002 - copy enclosed) which discloses the pre-
electoral rigging taking place in violation of the Constitution and 
laws of the land. The PPP had earlier stated the need to replace 
politically motivated officers with a neutral administration.

"The continuation of the politically motivated officials affects 
the fairness of the elections and subverts the will of the one 
hundred and forty million people of Pakistan. The confidence in the 
electoral process can be restored by concrete steps failing which 
the electoral turnout could be low as voters boycott a process with 
pre-judged conclusions."

The South Asian Tribune obtained evidence from top Pakistani 
bureaucrats visiting the United States about Musharraf regime's 
plan to rig the elections, she pointed out.

LARKANA, Aug 28: The returning officer for NA-204 (Larkana-I), 
Abdul Ghani Soomro, rejected on Wednesday the nomination papers of 
the chairperson of the PPP(SB), Ghinwa Bhutto, on the ground that 
she was not a graduate.

She had filed nomination papers to contest from NA-204 from where 
PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto, has also filed nomination papers.

The returning officer rejected the papers after he got the reply 
from the director accreditation and coordination of the University 
Grants Commission (UGC) of Pakistan.

The UGC said the mark sheets of the Technical Baccalaureate Part I 
issued by the president, directorate of examinations, Hanna Karam, 
Lebanon, was not equivalent to Bachelor's degree of Pakistan. The 
same returning officer also rejected nomination papers of Hafiz 
Ahmed Ali Abbasi, a candidate of the Mutahidda Majlis-i-Amal, from 
NA-204 (Larkana-I).

BENAZIR: Meanwhile, it was learnt that the UGC had maintained that 
the degree of Benazir Bhutto, which she had submitted with her 
nomination papers, was equivalent to Master's degree of Pakistan.

Earlier, the returning officer had given a two-page questionnaire 
having 66 questions to Ayaz Soomro, Benazir's advocate, for 
verification of her degrees.

Soomro told Dawn on Wednesday that after receiving the fax from the 
UCG that it had accepted Benazir's degrees, there was now no need 
to submit the questionnaire that had been sent to her in London.

The scrutiny of Benazir's nomination papers for NA-207 (Larkana-IV) 
and NA-204 (Larkana-I) would be held on Aug 30 and Sept 1, 
respectively, in Ratodero and Larkana.

By Our Correspondent

LONDON, Aug 28: The British government has said the Pakistan 
authorities have not approached Britain to extradite Benazir 
Bhutto.

Official sources told Dawn here on Wednesday that there was no 
extradition treaty between the two countries, therefore, the 
extradition of any person from either countries was not possible in 
the present circumstances.

Commenting on reports suggesting that the Pakistani authorities 
were in touch with the British government seeking extradition of 
Benazir Bhutto to Pakistan, officials said there was no such move.

Benazir Bhutto, who at present is living in London in self-exile, 
denies that she was ever involved in corruption, saying "the 
allegations against her are politically motivated."

Ms Benazir says she was planning to return to Pakistan before 
October elections. The exact date of her return is not known, 
however the PPP sources in London told Dawn that the decision about 
her return to Pakistan could be made within 10 days.

<a name="pppc">PPP complains of pre-poll rigging</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 28: The Pakistan People's Party has drawn the 
attention of the chief election commissioner to "pre-poll rigging" 
by the authorities.

It said false and exaggerated demands were being made for payment 
of government dues, income tax and utility charges at the nick of 
time.

In a communication addressed to the CEC, the acting secretary-
general of the PPP, Raza Rabbani, termed such demands unique method 
of seeking disqualification of candidates.

Candidates are being asked to make payments and prefer appeals 
subsequently. Further cumbersome details and additional 
documentation is being sought with regard to degrees that have been 
filed. This, he said, is yet another face of pre-poll rigging being 
indulged by the regime. 

It not only brings financial pressure on the intending candidate 
but his failure to comply exposes him to disqualification, he 
maintained.

He also drew the attention of the CEC to alleged pre-poll rigging 
in Jacobabad district and said it was an attempt to provide undue 
advantage to the candidates of the "Kings Party".

In this context, he said 42 polling stations for Thul STC, Misripur 
STC and Muradpur STC of Thul Taluka have been prepared under the 
supervision and instructions of a member of the Sindh Cabinet.

The said polling stations have been proposed in the area of one 
tribe alone, despite the fact that government buildings are 
available, 18 polling stations have been improvised. 
These polling stations remained unchanged in five general elections 
namely, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1993 and 1997.

Meanwhile, PPP's top leadership was engrossed in late night session 
at Bilawal House to workout strategy on the outcome of scrutiny of 
Ms Benazir Bhutto's nomination papers from two Larkana 
constituencies - NA-204 and 207 - which is to coincide with the 
hearing of her petition challenging certain measures to prevent her 
from contesting elections.

For the PPP, the outcome of scrutiny would have decisive bearing on 
the election campaign of the PPP Parliamentarians.

The kind of information she was asked to provide in a short span 
pertained to source of financing, the studies abroad, normal 
duration of course actual period in which the degree was obtained, 
mode of study, whether it was obtained through research or course 
work, number of credit hours. 

The long list is part of the UGC application form for equivalence 
of qualification certificate. But the ordeal of candidates is not 
confined to educational degree and the clearance of utility bills. 

They were being grilled by the returning officers on minor details 
of religious knowledge. Many of the ROs were asking Islamic 
philosophy, which made the candidates very nervous.

<a name="shar">Sharifs' banishment challenged</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LAHORE, Aug 30: A senior lawyer challenged banishment of deposed 
prime minister Nawaz Sharif, saying there was no legal bar on the 
exiled leader's return from Saudi Arabia.

"The law of the land does not have the sentence of exile," lawyer 
Khwaja Sultan Ahmad told AFP, arguing that there was no written 
agreement between the Sharifs and the government on the issue.

Sharif was convicted of tax evasion and plane hijacking in 2000, 
several months after Musharraf overthrew and jailed him in a 
bloodless coup in October, 1999.

The sentence was then waived under an alleged agreement between the 
government and Sharif which allegedly stipulated he and members of 
his family would not return to Pakistan for 10 years.

The statement of Ahmed, who served as defence counsel during 
Sharif's trial, came after election authorities gave preliminary 
approval to nominations filed by Sharif, brother Shahbaz and wife 
Kulsoom for the October polls.

Ahmed said when Sharif and his close relatives were sent into exile 
in December 2000, Muhammad Rafiq Tarrar was president of Pakistan 
but he has expressed his "ignorance about the existence of any 
contract" between the government and the Sharifs. The PML-N also 
insists that no such agreement exists.

"It appears there is no written agreement or contract for the exile 
of Nawaz Sharif," Ahmed said. "Moreover, Pakistan's constitution 
does not allow the government to send its nationals into exile," he 
said.

He also stressed that the pardon granted to Sharif renders him 
innocent and his criminal conviction now stands invalid.

"If there is nothing on the record, then the pardon will be 
presumed a pardon within the meaning of law of the land.

"After a pardon, the conviction and disqualification stands nowhere 
and the accused shall be deemed as innocent," he said.-AFP

Nawaz for NA-119 will be held on Friday (today).

However, the Muslim League (QA) suffered its first setback when the

LAHORE, Aug 28: The PML(N) will put up its candidates on all seats 
to defeat those who had betrayed the party, a statement issued 
quoted Mian Nawaz Sharif as saying.

The statement has been issued by former deputy mayor Mian Muhammad 
Rashid, who has just returned after meeting the deposed prime 
minister in Saudi Arabia.

Mr Sharif, who is now Quaid of his party, reiterated that he had 
struck no deal with the military regime. Similarly, he said, he 
himself had decided to elevate his brother Mian Shahbaz Sharif as 
party president. The rest, he said, was all propaganda.

He pointed out that the party had reposed confidence in him but it 
was on his insistence that they had accepted the decision to make 
Shahbaz Sharif as their president.

The former prime minister said his party would continue to 
cooperate with the PPP from the platform of the ARD. He said it was 
premature to say whether his party would be willing to form 
coalition with the PPP.

Mr Sharif said the basic issue at present was of the restoration of 
democracy, not formation of coalition.

activities with effect from Sept 1, allowing political parties 39 
days for election campaign before polling, scheduled to be held on 
Oct 10.

Announcing the decision, the government over-ruled the code of 
conduct issued by the Election Commission and maintained 
restriction on rallies and processions. "Rallies and processions on 
roads, streets, railway stations, etc., shall not be allowed as 
part of the political activity," said the order issued by the 
federal government.

Earlier, the code of conduct issued by the Election Commission had 
said that processions and public rallies would be allowed during 
the election campaign but specified certain conditions for holding 
such rallies so that it could not disrupt the normal public life.

For the public meeting too a number of conditions were spelt out in 
the order, which the political parties would have to observe in 
their election campaign.

Advance permission from the district and provincial governments for 
holding such gatherings would have to be sought by the political 
parties and the candidates, so that the campaign could progress in 
an orderly manner.

"Political meeting shall only be organized at places or areas 
specified by the district and provincial governments in order to 
prevent public inconvenience and to maintain normal public life. No 
traffic disruption and hindrance shall be allowed," it added.

It further said the time, place and other details of meetings would 
be decided by the district and provincial governments in 
consultation with the political party concerned well in advance and 
ordinarily no deviation in the agreed program should be allowed.

The restrictions, it said have been imposed to ensure peaceful and 
uninterrupted conduct of general elections and to avoid 
inconvenience to the general public.

The political activities in the country were banned by President 
Gen Pervez Musharraf soon after takeover on Oct 12, 1999. During 
this period the country barring only a few the country did not see 
any major political activity.

President Gen Pervez Musharraf in his recent press conference had 
said that processions and rallies would not be allowed during the 
election campaign.

Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal had announced that a train march would be 
launched from Rawalpindi on Aug 28 which had reportedly been 
disallowed by the government.

The Chief Election Commissioner Justice Irshad Hassan Khan last 
year as the Chief Justice of Pakistan had taken suo motu notice of 
the ban on political activities. The court had also sought an 
explanation from the government for keeping a ban. However the case 
is still pending before the apex court.

<a name="warr">Warrants for Benazir sent to all provinces</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohammad Asghar

RAWALPINDI, Aug 27: Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's 
"perpetual arrest warrants" issued by the National Accountability 
Bureau has been sent to the IGPs of the four provinces and the 
federal capital directing them to arrest her on her arrival, a 
source said on Tuesday.

Benazir's arrest warrants had been issued by the Accountability 
Court judge last year. Due to her absence, the warrants had been 
sealed by the NAB. But on Tuesday, the NAB authorities dispatched 
the warrants to the provincial governments and IGP Islamabad for 
their compliance, the source said.

The SP of Clifton Karachi, where the former prime minister's 
residence is located, has also been directed to arrest her, if she 
comes to her house.

The source said the warrants (4119) which had been sealed due to 
Benazir's self exile were opened on Tuesday in the wake of 
intelligence reports that she may reach Pakistan any time, the 
source said.

The government is reportedly seeking Interpol assistance for 
getting Benazir Bhutto arrested while she is abroad, the source 
added.

<a name="govt">Govt-Sharifs pact 'be made public'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 27: Chaudhry Shujaat Husain demanded that the 
government should let the nation know whether it had made any 
change to the agreement under which the Sharif family had been 
exiled to Saudi Arabia and barred from taking part in politics for 
10 years.

Talking to newsmen at his residence, the PML-QA leader said such a 
clarification was necessary in view of the gradual involvement of 
the Sharifs in politics, filing of nomination papers by them in 
various Lahore constituencies being the first step.

Nomination papers of Shahbaz Sharif from PP-141 (Lahore) have 
already been found in order on scrutiny.

Mian Nawaz Sharif and his wife, Kulsoom, have also filed nomination 
papers from various city constituencies and would be scrutinized 
according to the schedule.

Chaudhry Shujaat recalled that the nation had been told by 
President Musharraf that the Sharifs would stay away from the 
country as well as politics for 10 years. Now that the agreement 
was being flouted, the government should explain the actual 
situation to the nation, he added.

He told a questioner that his party would not file any appeal 
against the acceptance of Shahbaz Sharif's nomination papers.

Asked to explain the services of former PPP leader Sheikh Rohail 
Asghar and Mian Azhar's brother, Ashraf, on the basis of which they 
had been awarded PML-QA tickets, he said so far nobody had been 
awarded ticket and the party was likely to take a few more days to 
take final decisions to be able to make adjustments with other 
parties.

Chaudhry Shujaat is scheduled to meet the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal 
leaders in Islamabad on Wednesday to discuss mutual adjustments.

"How will the PML-QA justify electoral cooperation with the MMA 
when the two have divergent views on the presidency of Gen 
Musharraf, his competence to amend the Constitution and several 
other issues?" he was asked.

Chaudhry Shujaat said commitment to safeguard the Islamic 
provisions of the constitution was the common denominator. Gen 
Musharraf had given him a personal undertaking that he would not 
touch the Islamic provisions of the Constitution. In case he did, 
the PML-QA would turn against him, he warned.

He answered in the affirmative when asked if party ticket could be 
awarded to somebody who had just crossed into the PML-QA, or had 
not appeared before the parliamentary board nor made a formal 
request for the ticket. But, he made it clear that such cases would 
not be accorded priority when the party had its own electable 
aspirants.

He said Nazimeen who had resigned to be able to contest the 
elections had not been promised any party ticket.

He did not agree with the suggestion that an interim government 
could be formed or the elections might be delayed. "Such a course 
will be very dangerous for the military rulers," said the former 
minister.

Chaudhry Shujaat was critical of Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaaf chairman 
Imran Khan for his unkind remarks against the PML-QA.

He said the former cricket star should let the nation know his 
sources of income and from where he is receiving funds for his 
media campaign. "Is it Zakat money? Is it donation or Jewish 
money?"

He said in case the PTI chief failed to come up with satisfactory 
answers, it was the responsibility of the government to take notice 
of the matter.

Also, he said the PTI chief should explain whether Zakat money or 
donations could be used for organizing political gatherings.

The PML-QA leader said the PTI chairman had also met the Punjab 
governor after which he was left with no justification to criticize 
others calling on the chief executive of the province.

<a name="file">Papers filed for Nawaz, family members</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Zeeshan Siddique

LAHORE, Aug 26: The nomination papers of former prime minister 
Nawaz Sharif, his wife Kulsoom Nawaz and PML-N president Shahbaz 
Sharif were filed for six different constituencies of the city.

Nawaz's papers were filed for two National Assembly constituencies 
(NA-120 and NA-121) and those of Kulsoom for three National 
Assembly seats (NA-119, NA-120 and NA-122). Shahbaz's papers were 
submitted for one National Assembly seat (NA-119) and two Punjab 
Assembly constituencies (PP-141 and PP- 142).

The nomination papers of the Sharifs, living in exile in Saudi 
Arabia since December, 2000, were submitted by their 
representatives. While the nominations of Kulsoom and Shahbaz were 
filed in the afternoon, those of Nawaz were submitted in the 
evening at 5:30pm.

Returning Officer Mustafa Tanveer Safwat receiving the nomination 
papers of Nawaz Sharif and Kulsoom for NA-120 raised an objection 
that the papers of both had not been attested by the Pakistani 
embassy in Riyadh with regard to authorization of their respective 
representatives. The RO said there was nothing on record to satisfy 
the court that the papers had actually been signed by the 
candidates themselves or that they had authorized the 
representatives in writing.

The court observed that the attestation of a local notary public 
was not sufficient and in case the nomination papers of both the 
candidates duly attested by the Pakistani embassy were not filed by 
Sept 1, the court would reject them. Advocate Nasir members Ahmad 
Bhutta, submitting the papers, assured the RO that the attestation 
demanded by the court would be filed before the date of scrutiny.

The nomination papers with Urdu version had been used by the three 
Sharif family members.

The candidature of Nawaz Sharif for NA-120 had been proposed by 
Dilshad Ahmad while Hafiz Adil Abbasi had seconded him. A 
certificate of a BA degree with second division issued by the 
Government College, Lahore, had also been attached with his

(Rs606,000). Hussain Nawaz, Asma Nawaz and Kulsoom Nawaz had been 
shown as dependents of the former president of his own faction of 
the PML.

The candidature of Kulsoom had been proposed by Hafiz Mohammad 
Ayyaz and seconded by Mohammad Ejaz Butt. Her educational 
qualification had been mentioned as MA but a degree of BSc issued

<a name="lfoa">LFO aims to perpetuate dictatorship, says PPP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 26: The People's Party Parliamentarians said the Legal 
Framework Order 2002 is an attempt to give protection to 
dictatorship through a democratic facade.

Speaking at a news conference, PPP Parliamentarians chief Makhdoom 
Amin Fahim said if transparent, free and fair elections were held 
and Benazir Bhutto's path was not obstructed, then she would be the 
leader of the house in the future parliament. 

Amin Fahim said he was anxiously waiting to see "how Gen Pervez 
Musharraf honors his promise of free, fair and transparent 
elections. Let the elections be felt and seen on the ground to be 
free, fair and transparent," he added.

He said his party did not recognize the right of an individual or 
the Supreme Court to amend the constitution. The LFO 2002 is beyond 
the ambit of the apex court's judgment in Zafar Ali Shah's case, he 
maintained.

He warned that efforts to mutilate and finally do away with the 
1973 Constitution were fraught with grave danger because in the 
days ahead it will not be possible to have a similar consensus 
document. It is, therefore, necessary for the political forces to 
defend the 1973 Constitution.

Asked how the PPP would behave in view of the regime's declared 
stand that the future assembly would not have the authority to 
amend the amendments and reforms introduced by it, Amin Fahim said: 
"after winning mandate of the people we will have the right to 
review and amend according to the wishes and aspirations of the 
people."

He said whatever laws the regime had enacted, their objective was 
to block the way of the PPP and Ms Bhutto. In this context he 
particularly mentioned the amendments introduced on Aug 2. He urged 
the rulers to understand that transparent, free and fair elections 
were the need of the hour because, he added, the country was 
passing through a very critical juncture.

Amin Fahim said despite years of repressive policies adopted by the 
rulers against the PPP, it had chosen the course for restoration of 
democracy and protection of people's sovereignty.

He said in view of external threats and precarious security 
environment on our eastern and western borders, depressing economic 
situation, proliferation of sectarianisms amid deteriorating law 
and order situation, it was necessary to address these problems 
urgently through national reconciliation and by respecting people's 
will.

He did not rule out the possibility of seat adjustments and said 
this was part of electioneering but emphasized that his party would 
contest on its own agenda.

Asked whether at any stage Gen Musharraf had offered him a 
lucrative post if he quit the PPP, Makhdoom Amin Fahim instead of 
saying a categorical no said "I cannot leave the party."

PPP acting secretary general Raza Rabbani said his party was not 
prepared to empower any individual or institution to dictate as to 
who should contest the elections and who should not. In the past 
too, despite state repression against the party, it had never left 
the path of democratic struggle.

Doubting the assurances of free, fair and transparent elections, 
Mian Raza Rabbani said the voters' list, delimitation of 
constituencies and selective application of NAB laws and measures 
taken by Gen Musharraf during referendum amounted to pre-poll 
rigging. He pointed out that during referendum campaign Gen 
Musharraf had declared that those parties which supported him would 
emerge victorious in the general elections.

As part of this policy, he alleged, the National Alliance and the 
SDA were propped up to block the way of the PPP.

He also referred to discrimination against Sindh and referred to 
the appointment of what he termed as politically motivated 
ministers in the provincial cabinet. Three ministers, he said, did 
not even fulfil the graduation requirement and one of them was bank 
loan defaulter. He repeated his concern over the Governor Houses 
being used for electioneering of the king's party.

Rejecting the Benazir-specific laws he termed the Legal Framework 
Order as ultra vires and in confrontation with the constitution.

He said the LFO is neither federal parliamentary nor democratic. It 
is an attempt to protect democracy trough a facade of democracy. He 
was of the view that in view of undemocratic measures being adopted 
by the regime, political instability would increase if elections 
were not free, fair and transparent. There is bound to be a 
conflict between the parliament.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 25: The acting secretary general of Pakistan 
People's Party, Mian Raza Rabbani, has apprised the Chief Election 
Commissioner of the support of the government for the candidates of 
the 'king's party' and urged him to take notice of the matter.

In a letter addressed to the CEC, Mian Rabbani wrote, "the Pakistan 
People's Party has continuously brought it to the notice of the 
Commission that the governor houses particularly in Sindh and 
Punjab have been virtually converted into the election offices for 
the candidates of the "king's party".

The resources and machinery of the provincial administration are 
being used to put at serious disadvantage the contesting candidates 
being supported by the PPP, he said.

Apprising the CEC of the newspaper report he wrote: "on Aug 23, 
PML(QA) leaders Mian Muhammad Azhar, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and 
Chaudhry Pervez Ellahi met at the Governor House, Punjab, to 
finalize their list of candidates. The newspaper cutting of the 
daily Dawn dated Aug 24 is attached and mark annexure-A".

Asking the CEC to take notice of the government's illegal 
involvement in elections, Mian Rabbani wrote: "it is evident that 
when candidates are decided in the Governor House, then the result 
of the October elections particularly in the province of Punjab 
becomes a foregone conclusion. Such blatant support to a political 
party vitiates the atmosphere for free, fair and transparent 
elections".

<a name="nabi">NAB inquiry against former ETPB chief put off </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 24: The investigations initiated by the National 
Accountability Bureau against the former chairman of Evacuee Trust 
Property Board, Lt Gen Javed Nasir, who has allegedly swindled Rs3 
billion have lately been put off for "unknown reasons," a NAB 
official said.

"Yes investigations were going on against Mr Nasir but no case was 
pending against him," a colonel at NAB's office in Lahore told Dawn 
by phone.

The colonel did not comment on the reports that Mr Nasir had 
slipped out of the country after pocketing a sum of Rs3 billion in 
several shady land deals of EPTB. However, a NAB official at the 
headquarters here denied that Mr Nasir had left the country.

The official could not give any reason why the investigations 
against Mr Nasir had been put off and not pursued by the 
Accountability Bureau as it had been doing in the cases of 
corruptions against opposition politicians particularly former 
prime minister Benazir Bhutto and her spouse.

The NAB official also refused to disclose the nature of 
investigation pending against Lt Gen Javed Nasir who was also the 
head the country's prime intelligence agency during the tenure of 
former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

Political parties had expressed their condemnation over the 
government's attitude towards the corruption rampant in other state 
institutions. "This has shown once again that the serving and 
retired officers of army have been kept beyond the preview of 
accountability," PPP spokesman Farhatullah Baber said.

The reports that government was turning a blind eye towards the 
corruption of Mr Nasir in his capacity as the chairman of ETPB has 
exposed the accountability drive of the present government. "It is 
now clear that the on-going process is political motivated aimed at 
keeping political opponents out of election contest," he added.

The PPP which had been facing brunt of accountability would lodge a 
formal complaint with the NAB chairman Munir Hafeez to investigate 
this scam and apprehend all those involved in it irrespective of 
their rank or position.

Mr Nasir who after his retirement from service had been appointed 
as the Chairman of Evacuee Trust Property Board reportedly made 20 
land deals.

In one deal of five kanals and 16 marlas of land on main Ferozepur 
Road Mr Nasir siphoned off over Rs4 million as the land was sold at 
a throw away price of Rs348,000 against the market price of Rs4.5 
million. In another deal of land in Karachi, a plot of market value 
of Rs267m was sold at Rs5.6m.

Mr Nasir who had relinquished the charge of ETPB on July 16, 2001 
on being denied the extension allotted 916 kanals of land in Lahore 
to 11 different persons causing an estimated loss of Rs243 million.

Another plot of 48 canals on Super Highway Karachi was disposed of 
by him at Rs48m against its actual price of Rs240m.

The saga of land deals of Mr Nasir did not end here, in yet another 
deal of 100 kanals on main Raiwind Road Lahore, he made over Rs40m 
as the plot was sold at Rs46m whereas it market price was Rs90m.

A piece of land between Lahore Airport and Defence Housing Society 
was sold for Rs8.01m. At the time of deal it carried a market price 
of Rs91.85m.

Mr Nasir also made huge amount of money in leasing out PASSCO 
godown in Lahore and in construction of ETPB complex and Trust 
Plaza here in the federal capital.

In serious misappropriation in the construction of ETPB complex the 
former chairman caused a loss of Rs320m in the civil works alone.

<a name="nabc">NAB chief denies action against certain politicians</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 24: National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman Lt-
Gen Munir Hafiez said no-one involved in corruption or plunder of 
public wealth could or would escape accountability.

Speaking to reporters at a press conference, the chairman sought to 
dispel general public perception that the NAB had been acting 
"partially" against politicians opposing the military regime while 
ignoring corruption of those supporting it. "I do not agree with 
this perception."

However, he utterly failed to satisfy the reporters present there 
who wanted to know how many "corrupt" from the PML-QA had been 
nabbed. "Are those belonging to the PML-QA clean and honest and 
those from the PPP and the PML-N dishonest and corrupt," some of 
the journalists present wondered, quite loudly.

"The PML-QA has just been formed," the general defended the NAB, 
adding some 24 cases were at different stages of probe, 
investigation and prosecution against those belonging to the PPP, 
30 against those from the PML-N and 33 others. However, he could 
not name any pro-regime politician arrested by his organization. 
But he promised that he would do his homework before he again meets 
the press in future.

Replying to a question, he said all those politicians who had 
actually been convicted by the court in accountability cases would 
be barred from participating in the October polls. However, he was 
unable to tell the number of such politicians.

In reply to another question, the general stated that the cases 
against the members of the Sharif family exiled to Saudi Arabia had 
been "adjourned sine die". "If they try to return, the same cases 
would be reopened for prosecution," he said.

He said the government was making "normal" efforts for the 
extradition of PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto. "We are not focusing 
on her extradition or making any special attempts for it."

The chairman said the NAB law was there to stay (even beyond the 
October polls). However, he indicated that the government was 
looking at it to make changes to improve it in the light of its 
past experience and judgments given in the NAB cases by the courts. 
"Attempts to improve the laws should continue to update and improve 
them according to the needs of changing times. We have attained 85 
per cent conviction and want to raise conviction rate to 100 per 
cent," he added. He said the law had been validated by the Supreme 
Court and given constitutional cover and made part of Schedule VI. 
Though parliament (coming into existence after the general 
election) would be the supreme institution, it would not be able to 
repeal or change the law because presidential approval would be 
required for it. "The process of accountability must continue after 
the polls. The politicians would have to pledge for it," he said.

He stated the delays caused in the finalization of a case were due 
to long time taken to investigate them to fulfil the needs and 
requirements of the law and justice. "We don't want to file 
uncooked references against anyone or implicate any innocent 
person. That's why we take quite long to complete investigation and 
collect concrete evidence against the accused. It is a wrong 
impression that it is done to harass someone. We want to achieve 
100 per cent conviction rate."

Speaking of the cases against Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif 
Ali Zardari, he said the decisions in those references were delayed 
due to adjournments sought by the defence and not because of lack 
of evidence and proof. "We have ample evidence against them. The 
defence counsel are employing tactics to delay them."

The general said the NAB had never offered the choice of plea 
bargain to any accused. "It is the accused who confesses to his 
crime and agrees to return the amount plundered by him through plea 
bargain. First the application goes to the regional NAB committee 
and then to a central committee for decision. If the committee 
considers that the accused is offering to return all the amount 
looted by him, it is referred to the court for a decision for the 
purpose of transparency. We, the NAB, have nothing to do with it."

The chairman did not agree that the NAB had adversely affected the 
business climate in the country. He said the NAB had helped the 
banks recover Rs7 billion from the defaulters and created a "clean 
business environment". "Foreign investment is increasing in the 
country and stock markets are booming because of our drive to root 
out corruption and recover the looted public money," he insisted.

He said the NAB had proposed to the government to merge anti-
corruption and economic crime wings of the FIA with it. He said the 
NAB had demonstrated its ability to deal with these crime which was 
why it had put forward this proposal to the government. Besides, he 
said, such cases should be registered, probed and prosecuted under 
a uniform law. At present, the punishments awarded under the NAB 
law were more strict than the laws under which the FIA registered 
the cases. He said the final decision in this regard would be taken 
by the government.

He said no political party had so far refused to participate in the 
National Ehtesab Conference being organized by the NAB. However, he 
added, the heads of parties might not be able to attend the

<a name="msbe">Ms Bhutto 'qualified' to contest polls</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Majeed Gill

BAHAWALPUR, Aug 24: PPP chairperson Ms Benazir Bhutto is qualified 
in every respect to contest the elections and even the rules framed 
by the government do not disqualify her in any way. This was stated 
by PPPP leader Aitzaz Ahsan, who filed his nomination papers from 
NA-187 (Bahawalpur five), while talking to Dawn.

He said the government's contention was entirely wrong because Ms 
Bhutto was convicted for not appearing in NAB courts. He said the 
NAB Ordinance could not be applied to Ms Bhutto till she returned 
to the country.

According to the NAB Ordinance, he said, it was only applicable to 
only such Pakistanis abroad who had been in the government service. 
But, Aitzaz said Ms Bhutto had never been in the government service 
for a single day.

He said under Article 260, a prime minister or MNA was never 
considered and treated as a government servant. Hence, he said, 
that under Section 31(A) of the NAB Ordinance whatever sentences 
had been passed against Ms Bhutto had no legal binding and that her 
nomination papers could not be rejected.

Secondly, he said, in the light of a Supreme Court judgment in the 
case of Liaquat Hussain in 1999, the trial against anybody in 
Pakistani courts could not be initiated in any offence in his/her 
absence.

This ruling of the Supreme Court was applicable to all cases and 
offences and none of them was exempted from it, he said. If any one 
was accused of absence from court or was absconding, then in 
accordance with the SC judgment, the trial against such person 
could only be initiated when either he was arrested and brought to 
court or surrendered himself to court. He said in that case the 
alleged accused could also produce the reason of his absence from 
court.

Mr Ahsan said that as the convictions to Ms Bhutto were announced 
in absentia, hence legally and constitutionally, these did not 
exist. He said on this ground and other legal basis, the PPPP was 
of the firm view that neither Ms Bhutto could be prevented from 
returning to Pakistan nor her nomination papers could be cast away.

To a question, Mr Ahsan said that if the RO rejected her papers, it 
would be challenged in the Supreme Court. But, he said, we were 
confident that courts would admit our point of view.

He said if Ms Bhutto's papers were not accepted, then party's CEC 
and ARD would meet and decide the future course of 
action.Meanwhile, Mian Riaz Hussain Peerzada (Millat Party) and 
Syed Tasneem Nawaz Gardezi (PML-QA) filed papers from NA-186 
(Bahawalpur four), Rizwan Akhtar from (PP-273) and Dr Muhammad 
Afzal (PPP) from PP-276.

<a name="mush">Musharraf has enslaved Pakistan, says Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Amanullah Ghilzai 

LONDON, Aug 24: The PPP Chairperson, Benazir Bhutto, has accused 
President Pervez Musharraf of enslaving the Pakistani nation to 
foreigners to promote his dictatorial rule.

Addressing a big rally to mark the start of the party's election 
campaign here in the famous Trafalgar Square in Central London, Ms 
Bhutto specifically termed president Bush's support for Musharraf 
as deplorable. She said the world community should treat "the 
Pakistani dictator" in the same manner as it deals with President 
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, and Saddam Hussain of Iraq.

In her bilingual speech - Urdu and English - Ms Bhutto mostly 
focused on Pakistan's foreign policy, though occasionally, she 
touched on domestic issues as well.

She said, as the situation in the South Asian region is tense, 
Pakistan needed a democratically-elected government to help ease 
the recent tension in the region.

"History shows that democracies never go to war against other 
democracies," she said.

She compared President Musharraf with Mulla Omar of Afghanistan. 
"Musharraf wants to become the king and Amirul Momineen of Pakistan 
as Mulla Omar.

"Omar's policies resulted in the destruction of his country, but 
the people of Pakistan would not allow Musharraf to let their 
country be ruined by their own dictator," she added.

Ms Bhutto expressed sadness over the death of many Pakistani youths 
who suffered and died in Afghanistan and deplored the attitude of 
several religious leaders and the government for what she said, 
were doing very little to secure their safe release.

Referring to the corruption charges against her, she said: "The aim 
of the military government is to keep me away from politics. 

The corruption charges against me and many other political leaders 
are politically motivated," she added. She also accused President 
Musharraf of buying 300 acres in Bahawalpur.

Referring to the recent amendments by President Musharraf, she 
said: "These amendments are an insult to 140 million Pakistanis."

<a name="nonm">Non-Muslims not barred from becoming judges: SHC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 27: The Sindh High Court has held that there is no 
constitutional bar to prevent a non-Muslim from becoming a judge of 
the High Court. This has been held by a bench of the SHC which 
disposed of a constitutional petition in which, among other things, 
appointment of Justice Rana Bhagwandas was challenged.

The bench comprised Justice Zahid Kurban Alavi, Justice Shabbir 
Ahmed and Justice Ghulam Rabbani.

Petitioner M. Shafi Muhammadi, who is a practising advocate, 
through a constitutional petition (No D-412/1998), had prayed that 
the respondent had no authority to appoint any judge in violation 
of the Islamic points deduced in the judges case and/or to act on 
un-Islamic points in violation of the Qadiani's case with reference 
to the points decided by the Federal Shariat Court (FSC).

It was his contention that the respondent had no authority to 
appoint Rana Bhagwandas, a Hindu, in violation of Islamic concept, 
otherwise it should be amounting to declare the Qadiani's case to 
have been decided on self-made presumption.

It was also his contention that the respondent had no authority to 
appoint Ms Majida Rizvi, former judge of the High Court, to deal 
with each and every kind of case, including Hudood and Qisas cases.

The petitioner had also questioned the respondent's authority to 
issue the notification dated September 30, 1996 to regularize the 
appointment of Justice Rana Bhagwandas, in violation of the Islamic 
concept or in violation of Verse 141 of Surah Al-Nisa of the Holy 
Quran or to regularize the appointment of former Justice Majida 
Rizvi, without clarifying that she could not sit over Hudood and 
Qisas cases.

It was also his prayer not to regularize the services of any judge 
already appointed in violation of the Islamic points which were 
highlighted in the Judges cases; to restrain Bhagwandas from 
working as judge of this Court; and to restrain retired Justice 
Majida Rizvi from sitting over the cases involving Hudood and Qisas 
matters.

The petitioner had further alleged that under the garb of the 
Judges case, Justice Sajjad Ali Shah (as he then was the chief 
justice of Pakistan) followed the first point to get persons of his 
own choice appointed in Sindh by ignoring the criteria which was 
set in "the Judges case; Rana Bhagwandas, J., was not confirmed by 
the government of Benazir Bhutto, like other judges, but was got 
confirmed by the chief justices concerned after the Judges case as 
per notification dated 30.9.1996. 

A question arises whether Rana Bhagwandas, J., a Hindu, who is not 
a Muslim by his own belief, can keep the sacred book of the Holy 
Quran in his hand particularly in the light of the judgment in the 
Qadiani's case who claim to be Muslims but are not treated as 
Muslims by any other Muslim sect in Pakistan, and the government 
has failed to treat the appointment of Bhagwandas to be un-Islamic, 
illegal and unconstitutional because he would have no right to keep 
the Holy Quran in his hands to decide cases in accordance with the 
Islamic principles.

It was also the petitioner's contention that to some extent the 
appointment of former justice Majida Rizvi also fell within the 
ambit of certain important points which were not disputed by 
different Muslim jurists.

It was further urged in the petition that Bhagwandas's appointment 
as a judge of the SHC was against the provisions of the 
Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, he being not 
qualified to be a judge, all his decisions from the date of 
appointment as judge of the SHC were void without jurisdiction, 
hence corum non judice and he was again guilty of misconduct. His 
appointment and the notification issued in this regard were both 
void and invalid.

After hearing counsel, the bench held that article 193 of the 
constitution dealt with the appointment of High Court Judges. There 
was no bar specifically mentioned in the articles which would 
prevent a non-Muslim from becoming a judge of the High Court.

In fact, the bench held, under article 203-A qualification as 
regards a judge of the FSC was concerned, it was clearly mentioned 
that a person should be an Aalim well versed in the knowledge of 
Shariah. The constitution also specifically mentioned Muslim 
judges, therefore it would be logical to conclude that a non-Muslim 
could not be a judge of the FSC. There was no such bar or a 
specific mention that there had to be a Muslim judge in respect of 
the High Court.

In the judgment authored by Justice Zahid Kurban Alavi, the bench 
was also of the view that various Fiqhs and observations of most of 
scholars, especially in respect of the qualifications of a Qazi did 
acknowledge that all services would be open to Muslims and non-
Muslims alike. There was definite emphasis on the fact that for a 
Qazi to sit and adjudicate on a dispute requiring interpretation of 
Shariah it would be necessary for the Qazi to be not only well 
versed in the knowledge of Islam, but also he should have full 
faith in the religion.

Justice Alavi observed that it would be appropriate to note that 
wherever the makers of the constitution had intended to debar a 
non-Muslim from holding any public office then explicit and 
specific provision to that effect had been incorporated in the 
constitution.

"We have no authority or power to pass a restraining order against 
a judge of the Supreme Court," held the bench.

<a name="agos">Agosta launched; ship deal on cards</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, Aug 24: As Pakistan Navy launched the first indigenously 
built Agosta 90B submarine on Saturday, six months ahead of sea 
trials, it announced to negotiate a similar deal with China for the 
construction of four surface ships.

"We have achieved a very big (defence) capability," said Chief of 
the Naval Staff, Admiral Abdul Aziz Mirza, at the launching 
ceremony at the Naval Dockyard here.

"Pakistan Navy today joins the elite club of a very few countries 
which have the ability to build submarines," said the naval chief.

The launching of submarine "SAAD" is Pakistan Navy's biggest 
achievement and contribution towards indegenization and self-
reliance. With this launch, PN's submarine strength has increased 
to nine, said the naval chief.

The submarine is equipped with four bow torpedo tubes and missiles, 
with its fighting capacity coordinated by the French-made Submarine 
Tactical Integrated Combat System (STICS).

According to Pakistan Navy, the Agosta 90-B has been designed to 
operate as an anti-submarine, anti-surface and intelligence 
gathering platform and is also capable of diving deeper than 300 
meters (about 1,000 feet) with a maximum sprint speed of 20 knots 
(40 kilometres per hour).

Presence of the Chairman of Direction des Constructions Navales 
(DCN), France, at the launching ceremony, whose 11 engineers were 
killed and 12 were injured in a car bomb explosion here on May 8, 
symbolized the continuation of cooperation between the two 
countries.

He said the third Agosta 90B, being built indigenously, will be 
launched sometimes next year. Admiral Mirza later told newsmen that 
for the third Agosta, 70 per cent of construction work would be 
carried out here whereas some sections would be imported from 
France.

The contract for the construction of three such submarines was 
signed in 1995 but the work on the project was initiated in 1997. 
The first submarine, KHALID, built in France, was inducted in the 
PN fleet in 1999.

About the future plans of shipbuilding in Pakistan, Admiral Mirza 
said the government has okayed plan for the construction of four 
surface ships for which we want to negotiate a deal with China on 
transfer of technology basis.

One of the four F-22 P type 2,500-ton frigates will be built in 
China while the remaining three will be built in Pakistan in the 
existing facilities, said Admiral Mirza.

He said that acquisition and construction of surface ships was also 
a priority for the Navy. It is necessary that after the 
construction of these three submarines this program should continue 
in the future, he emphasized.

Replying to a question, he said that despite the presence of a 
large number of submarines in the Indian fleet, Pakistan has an 
edge as far as the submarine capability - weapon systems, sensors 
and missile system - is concerned.

He dispelled the impression that India could mount a blockade of 
Karachi and said there is a lot of difference between the 1971 
situation and the current circumstances. He stated that our 
aviation assets also have missiles. So now the enemy cannot even 
think of anything like the blockade of Karachi. If their ships do 
come near Karachi then we will get the best target, he added.

Referring to the incident in which French engineers fell victim to 
terrorist attack in Karachi, Admiral Mirza said that though this 
could have inflicted irrevocable damage, the Agosta project 
remained on track, "thanks to the excellent cooperation between 
France and Pakistan."

"This is a message to those who committed the cowardly act of 
terrorism that such incidents will not deter or dissuade the two 
countries from achieving the common desired objectives," said 
Admiral Mirza.

<a name="bena">Benazir's media trial plea disposed of</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 26: The petition filed by PPP chairperson Benazir 
Bhutto on Oct 16, 1997, against her media trial came up for 
rehearing before a special division bench, comprising Justice S. 
Ahmed Sarwana and Justice Mujeebullah Siddiqui.

The petition related to the media campaign initiated by former 
senator Saif-ur-Rehman, the then chairman of the Ehtesab Cell, at 
the behest of Nawaz Sharif through government controlled electronic 
media - Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation and the PTV.

Counsel for the petitioner, K. M. Nadeem; deputy attorney general 
Nadeem Azhar for the federation and Azam Lone, counsel for the PTV, 
were present. Mr Jawed advocate for PBC was noted absent.

Counsel K. M. Nadeem referred to ground No 5-A of the amended 
petition, which says that "Respondents No 5 and 6 (PBC & PTV) by 
the nature of their organizational structures are designed to be 
public service institutions. They are required to be fair, correct, 
impartial, and balanced in dissemination of information/news 
through broadcasting or telecasting. Particularly such information/ 
news which is likely to affect the good name and reputation of a 
citizen.

"The two respondents, although controlled by the government, are by 
constitution and law required to act accordingly in case any 
adverse material/information is being broadcast or telecast.

"The affected party, on the basis of principles of natural justice 
and constitutional and legal guarantees, is entitled equally to 
comment or contradict the allegations, which opportunity has to be 
afforded to the affected party by the respondents. Such has not 
been done in the case of the petitioner who has been maliciously 
victimized selectively and singularly."

He also drew the court's attention to prayer clause G, in which the 
petitioner had sought court's indulgence in prohibiting "the media-
trial' of the petitioner, directly or indirectly, without proof and 
without affording her due opportunity to comment upon or contradict 
the false and baseless allegations and to direct the respondents No 
5 and 6 to be fair, correct, impartial and balanced by providing 
equal opportunity to the petitioner affected by the news as and 
when telecast or broadcast affecting or likely to affect the person 
and/or property of the petitioner."

Counsel for PTV, Azam Lone, claimed that he had not received 
Rs5000.00 by way of costs as ordered by the court. The cost was 
forthwith paid by the counsel for the petitioner, K. M. Nadeem, who 
submitted that the petitioner had already paid a sum of Rs10,000 by 
way of cost and deposited the same with the high court bar library 
as ordered.

With the consent of the parties, the prayer clause 'G' has been 
allowed with the direction that the PBC and the PTV shall remain 
balanced, fair, and impartial in their broadcasting and telecasting 
in respect of the petitioner. With these directions the petition 
was disposed of.

refused to give security clearance for the shifting of Mr Zardari 
to the police line hospital, therefore, the interior division 
decided to remove Mr Zardari to Pims , the source said.

<a name="scre">SC rejects Wattoo's poll plea</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: The Supreme Court dismissed three petitions 
filed by politicians convicted on the charges of corruption, 
seeking permission to contest forthcoming general elections.

Two petitions were filed by Mian Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo, former chief 
minister of Punjab and by Makhdoom Ali Raza Shah, former MPA of 
Punjab.

Senior counsel, S. M. Zafar, represented Mian Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo 
and contended that disqualifying a politician was equivalent to 
awarding death sentence to an accused of murder.

He asked the apex court to set aside the LHC order wherein it had 
turned down the request of convicted politician, to hear his appeal 
at urgent basis.

Manzoor Wattoo had approached the LHC to take up his petition at 
urgent basis. The request was turned down by the LHC office. When 
it was challenged before the judge, he upheld the office order.

The SC bench comprising Justice Qazi Mohammad Farooq, Justice 
Deedar Hussain Shah and Justice Mohammad Nawaz Abbasi, after 
hearing S. M. Zafar and NAB prosecutor general Naveed Rasool, 
dismissed the petitions.

Makhdoom Ali Raza Shah, another petitioner, was convicted on the 
charges of building community centre at his personal property with 
the government funds of Rs 260,000. He stated that he had returned 
the amount to the government and even then his case was sent to the 
court which convicted him. He also sought permission to contest 
forthcoming election which was denied to him.

<a name="mans">Mansur's petition hearing on 28th</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 25: A division bench of the Sindh High Court would 
take up on Aug 28 Mansurul Haq's constitutional petition 
challenging the fresh reference instituted against him by NAB 
authorities, despite a plea bargain.

The petition was filed by his counsel Iqtidar Ali Hashmi after he 
had requested a division bench to stop proceeding on his petition 
for enlargement of his client on bail in the reference which he 
termed illegal and based on malafide intentions.

The petitioner has prayed for declaring that filing of fresh 
references against him, including reference No 25 of 2002 filed 
recently at Karachi by the National Accountability Bureau, illegal 
and without any legal force.

He also prayed for restraining the respondents from instituting any 
further inquiries /proceedings and references against him in view 
of the plea bargain settled before an accountability court at 
Rawalpindi in the reference No 43/20001 wherein more than double 
the amount alleged against the petitioner was paid.

It is also his prayer that compliance with the accountability court 
No III Rawalpindi Order of June 15, which envisages return of his 
assets as well as those of his relations, be ordered.

It is the petitioner's case that institution of inquiries by the 
chairman of the Ehtesab Bureau, Saifur Rahman, in spite of firm 
commitments made by the then prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, who has 
asked the petitioner to resign, was absolutely against the ethical 
norms.

It is his case that in any case the plea bargain settlement in the 
earlier reference No 43/2001 wherein he had paid 7.5 million US 
dollars instead of 33, 69,383 US dollars the total amount alleged 
to have been taken as share of kickbacks and commission, in any 
other proceeding by way of reference or inquiries and allegations 
is illegal and without any force of law.

It was also against the firm assurances made by the NAB chairman 
personally, who at his own will had contacted the petitioner, for a 
plea bargain during pendency of the reference. It is his case that 
the statement of the highest functionary of NAB was recorded during

<a name="meer">Meerwala case verdict on 27th</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

MULTAN, Aug 24: The Dera Ghazi Khan anti-terrorism court will give 
its verdict on the Meerwala gang-rape case on Aug 27 as both 
prosecution and defence concluded their arguments.

In his final arguments, special public prosecutor Ramzan Khalid 
Joiya demanded exemplary punishment for the 14 accused while 
declaring them guilty of a 'planned' gang-rape.

Replying to the arguments of the defence counsel, Mr Joiya admitted 
that two real brothers could not commit 'zina' (rape) in each 
other's presence if it was a matter of compromise. When it came to 
revenge, he said even a father and son could commit 'zina' 
together.

"Wasn't it astonishing that accused Abdul Khaliq met the shock of 
his life after seeing Shakoor in an objectionable condition with 
his sister Salma in the afternoon and at night the same day he 
(Khaliq) had garlanded himself as a groom," said the prosecutor.

He expressed surprise that the accused again locked Shakoor and 
Salma in a room. He pleaded, in fact, the accused staged a drama to 
cover up the sodomy committed to Shakoor by his (Khaliq's) brother 
Punnu and his accomplices Manzoor and Jamil.

On substitution of Fayyaz, he said this accused was arrested in the 
second week of July last and the challan was submitted in the case 
of July 18. But, he said none of his relatives had during this 
period pointed out that he had been arrested instead of the actual 
culprit. The same was the situation with accused Ghulam Farid, he 
added.

He asked why didn't the defence got them identified from any of the 
prosecution witnesses, including the victim, despite having doubts 
over their identity.

The prosecutor said Mukhtaran Mai had identified them as among her 
tormentors. He said accused Khaliq in his statement at first 
instance said he only took the girl (the victim) away from the 
Panchayat but did not mention any 'nikkah' with Mukhtaran Mai. He 
argued that the 'nikkah' story was a 'concocted statement' of the 
defence.

Concluding his remarks, Mr Joiya argued that it was the theory of 
law that time, place and mode were important regarding the 
occurrence of a crime. He said the defence had admitted facts about 
time and place as described by the prosecution.

He also pleaded that the defence in its final arguments had tried 
to confront PW11, PW13 and PW14 with their alleged statements given 
to the Dera Ghazi Khan Range SP (crime) Mirza Abbas, whom the 
defence had first called as its witness and then declared him 
'hostile'. The prosecutor asked what moral and legal authority was 
left with the defence that it mainly relied on the file of an 
official against whom it expressed distrust in the court.

He said the SP crime was entrusted with a task to probe only 
inefficiency, irregularities and corruption among the Jatoi police 
ranks and that he had nothing to do with the case under trial at 
the court. He pointed out that the SP's inquiry had no mention of 
the police malpractices.

Earlier, the defence completed its arguments before the court. On 
the third-day running, defence counsel Malik Muhammad Saleem said 
on June 22 last only the complainants (Gujjar family) were anxious 
to strike a compromise with the Mastois because Shakoor had been 
taken by the police after he was caught red-handed with Salma while 
committing 'zina'.

He said, therefore, the complainants agreed to the demand of Abdul 
Khaliq for his instant 'nikkah' with Mukhtaran Mai as a patch-up 
for the release of Shakoor from the police custody. Otherwise, he 
said it was unnatural to assume that Sabir went to the police 
station along with Abdul Khaliq to get released Shakoor, though, a 
short while ago four persons including Khaliq had gang-raped his 
(Sabir's) niece.

Concluding his arguments, the defence counsel reiterated man-made 
laws were no match for Allah's divine law which called for 
testimony of four eye-witnesses to award punishment to the accused 
in a rape case.

He alleged the Meerwala incident was the outcome of the 'villainy' 
of Maulvi Abdul Razzaq (PW11) and a conspiracy against Islam.

<a name="piat">PIA to buy 10 aircraft</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: Pakistan International Airlines Corporation 
(PIAC) will purchase 10 new or slightly used aircraft by 2003 to 
modernize its fleet.

"We have just purchased six used B747-300 aircraft from Cathay 
Pacific and now we have been allowed by the federal authorities to 
induct 10 more aircraft into PIA fleet for which $150 million was 
also offered by the government", said secretary defence and 
chairman PIAC, Lt-Gen(retd) Hamid Nawaz Khan.

Speaking at a news conference he said Aircraft Acquisition 
Committee headed by Vice Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Salim 
Arshed was holding indepth discussion with Boeing and Airbus 
companies to acquire 10 aircraft for PIA on competitive prices and 
without allowing anyone to indulge in kickbacks and commission.

He said the committee has worked out a 10-year fleet replacement 
plan covering in detail financial, operational and marketing 
aspects as an integral part of the PIA's business plan to set the 
strategies and competitive direction for the next decade. The vice 
chief of air staff and managing director of PIA Chaudhry Ahmad 
Saeed were also present on the occasion and talked to newsmen.

The PIA chairman said that three B-777 family of aircraft will be 
purchased by 2003. Similarly, he said the PIA will acquire 7 
Turboprop aircraft by 2003 to replace F-27 aircraft.

Responding to a question he said that since prices of aircraft have 
declined substantially due to events of Sept 11, PIA was likely to 
go for new aircraft. "But we do have option, either to purchase new 
aircraft directly from Boeing or to consider leasing of new/used 
aircraft", he said adding that purchase/lease of slightly used 
aircraft from United Airlines or the combination of new and used 
aircraft could also be considered.

<a name="orde">Order on Zardari's release plea reserved</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Aug 28: A bench of the Sindh High Court reserved its order 
on a miscellaneous application filed by Hakim Ali Zardari, seeking 
release on bail on medical grounds, suspension of impugned sentence 
and fine awarded to him by an accountability court.

The bench comprised Justice Mohammed Roshan Essani and Justice 
Mohammed Mujeebullah Siddiqui.

Counsel for Mr Zardari, Barrister Azizullah Shaikh, submitted that 
the applicant is an old man of 76 years. He relied on a medical 
report of a special medical board which had examined the applicant 
on the orders of a SHC bench, dealing with the bail application of 
the applicant.

The accused has been suffering from Osteoporosis and Arthritis and 
has been under medical care, he added.

The counsel relied on a number of judgments by the Supreme Court, 
including Manzoor Watoo versus the state and Mohammed Saeed Mehdi 
cases.

Deputy prosecutor general, NAB, Anwar Tarique, relied on the 
judgement in Usman Farooqui case and said that bail was denied even 
after medical grounds were agitated.

"The applicant has been convicted and what is the guarantee that he 
will return to the country after treatment," he maintained. The 
court said the accused can be asked to submit sufficient security.

The NAB counsel objected to the prayer by the applicant for 
suspension of fine and forfeiture of immovable assets of the 
applicant.

Barrister Shaikh submitted that it would be sufficient if the court 
ordered that no third party interest was created in respect of 
property owned by the applicant.

The bench observed that auction of the said property could be 
stayed and then reserved the orders.

<a name="newr">New rules for US student visa</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Aug 29: Students intending to acquire an education in the 
United States have been advised to apply two to three months in 
advance for the visa. This was stated by an official of the US 
government here.

He said that the US has been changing the manner in which it 
processes the visas for many people around the world.

The official said that the US has been known for years as one of 
the freest country's in the world, and that it welcomes visitors, 
students and others from outside the US. "Unfortunately, some 
people have abused our welcome and they conducted acts of terrorism 
against the United States last year. As a result, (the) United 
States government has been reviewing the visa process and has added 
some additional steps for certain categories of people before a 
consular officer can issue a visa," he added.

He said that prior to Sept 11, consular officers had the right to 
interview a person and make a decision almost immediately regarding 
the issuance of visas.

The official said that now, in addition to the responsibility of 
the consular officer to determine someone's eligibility for a visa, 
information about the applicant needs to be sent back to the US for 
additional checks and processing before a visa can be issued.

He made it clear that this is not a requirement that has been 
levied against Pakistanis alone. The requirement has been levelled 
against many people in the world. The official said that this is 
just one of the costs that is a result of the events of Sept 11.

He maintained that the additional checks are aimed at knowing who 
is in the US, and for what purpose they are coming.

The official said that though visa functions still stay with the US 
department of state, the policy in regard to visas and processing 
is going to be set by the department of homeland security - the new 
government department that has been created by US President Bush.

Homeland security will set the policy, and the department of state 
will execute this policy.

The official pointed out that there have been some additional 
regulations passed by the US immigration service during this 
period. Now, no one who is in the US on a tourist visa can start 
studying in an institution unless they go outside the US, obtain a 
proper student visa and then reenter. They cannot change their 
status.

Universities in the US and other institutions need to report to the 
government which students have shown up and which ones have not, so 
that the government can look for those persons in the US who were 
issued student visas and have not joined their schools.

The official was of the view that some people thought that it was 
an easy way to enter the US with student visas, and they were using 
this method. So the government cannot exempt students from these 
checks, he added.

He said that citizens of up to 24 countries were included in the 
list of students that require checks.

The official said that he cannot give a specific time for the 
processing of visa applications, and that it may take at least 30, 
60 or 90 days time before clearance can come. It would be on a case 
by case basis.

He said that they have been telling people in Islamabad to plan two 
to three months in advance, as this is the time needed for 
clearance - whether the application is for a tourist visa or 
student or exchange visits - it is the same clearance process one 
has to go through. The US is not isolating students and 
discriminating against them. This is the procedure for a whole 
class of people unless they are going on an official government 
visit. In that situation, they are exempted from security checks, 
he remarked.-APP

<a name="writ">Writ filed in LHC to exhume Masih's body</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Nadeem Saeed

MULTAN, Aug 29: The Anjuman Mazareen Punjab (AMP) has filed two 
separate writ petitions in the Lahore High Court, one for the 
exhumation of the body of Suleman Masih and the other for the 
recovery of tenants' leader Anwar Javed Dogar.

AMP President Chaudhry Abdul Jabbar told Dawn by telephone from 
Okara that the petition for the exhumation of Suleman's body to 
conduct autopsy was filed by his father Pitras Masih and the habeas 
corpus petition for the recovery of missing AMF chairman Anwar 
Javed Dogar by his wife.

The body of Suleman Masih, 20, was handed over to his family by the 
Rangers on Aug 25, a day after the paramilitary force and police 
opened fire at a gathering of Okara military farm tenants. It is 
believed that Suleman was among the tenants rounded up by the 
Rangers on Aug 24 during the operation to crush tenants' revolt for 
ownership rights over the lands they had been cultivating for 
nearly a century.

The Rangers authorities had forced the family of Suleman to bury 
his body without performing autopsy and other legal formalities.

The LHC issued notice to the Punjab advocate-general for Friday on 
the habeas petition to inform the court about the whereabouts of 
Dogar and detail of the charges, if any, against him.

Dogar has been missing since the Rangers and police opened fire at 
the tenants' gathering in Okara on Aug 24. The authorities 
expressed ignorance about his whereabouts while his wife alleged 
that he had been arrested by the Rangers.

SIEGE CONTINUES: On the other hand, the Rangers and police had been 
keeping on the siege of the villages of Okara military farms for 
the sixth day running on Thursday.

Anyone wanting to go to the besieged villages was said to be 
roughed up by the law enforcers at the entry points.

The authorities had deployed more contingents around Chak 10/4L 
ahead of the memorial service of deceased Suleman Masih, scheduled 
to be held on Friday at his native village.

Top priests of Catholic sect of the Christian community, tenants' 
representatives from all the 21 state-managed agricultural and 
livestock farms of Punjab and human rights activists are likely to 
attend the memorial service.

AMP general secretary Younas Iqbal told Dawn that the Rangers and 
police were creating hurdles to check a large gathering at the 
memorial service. He claimed that several residents of Chak 10/4L 
had been arrested on various pickets of the 'law enforcers.'

Meanwhile, the Okara police had shifted injured tenants Mohammad 
Akram, Mohammad Jameel and Ghulam Rasool to Sahiwal central jail 
from the Okara DHQ hospital where they were under treatment after 
sustaining bullet injuries on Aug 24. They have been charged with 
killing Suleman Masih.

<a name="imfc">IMF calls for PIA privatisation </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: The IMF has called for privatising PIA to reduce 
its losses and make it more competitive, says secretary defence Lt 
Gen Hamid Nawaz Khan.

"We had recently met the IMF mission members when they were here 
and told them that we are not against the privatisation of the 
PIA", he further stated.

Mr Khan who is also the chairman of PIA told a news conference that 
a number of steps had been taken to improve the performance of the 
organization. However, he said the PIA management will welcome some 
organized disinvestment of the national airlines.

Managing Director of PIA Chaudhry Ahmed Saeed who was also present 
on the occasion said that he was also not against the privatisation 
of PIA.

Responding to a question Mr Khan said that trade union activities 
had been banned in the PIA to run the organization efficiently and 
without any interference.

Asked what was the guarantee that the union in the PIA will not be 
restored when the new government took over after October polls, he 
said that he was not against certain healthy trade union 
activities. But he said that these activities should not be allowed 
to disrupt the normal functioning of the airlines.

The managing director said that personally he was in favour of the 
revival of the trade union activities in PIA.

Both the officials also said that the government was not 
encouraging unnecessary retrenchments in the national carrier. 
However, they said that they will have to induct private sector 
professionals in the PIA to improve its performance. "But for this 
purpose we will have to offer huge salaries", Mr Saeed said adding 
that presently a director in PIA drew roughly Rs50,000 per month 
but in case someone from the market was hired, he will have to be 
given about Rs300,000 per month.

"Those who are experts in the private sector seek better salaries 
and better perks", the managing director of the PIA said.

<a name="asia">Asian Bank to provide $2.4 billion </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: The Asian Development Bank has formulated a $2.4 
billion Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Pakistan to support 
a number of initiatives, including poverty alleviation, good 
governance and targeted projects for women.

"We will be extending average $800 million annually for ensuring 
good governance, agriculture, rural development, energy 
development, transport, finance, health and education, and water 
supply and sanitation in both urban and rural areas," said ADB 
Country Director for Pakistan, Murshuk Ali Shah.

Speaking at a news conference here on Monday, he said out of $2.4 
billion proposed assistance, 60 per cent had been earmarked 
specifically for programs that have a direct impact on poverty 
reduction. In terms of projected allocations for the various 
sectors, 27 per cent is for the social sector, 22 per cent for 
governance and finance, and 13 per cent for agriculture and rural 
development.

In addition, a technical assistance program worth $5-6 million 
annually, supporting project processing and advisory/capacity 
building assistance had been programmed. 

As part of the ADB's Economic Sector Work Program, the country 
strategy and program would support research, analysis, and dialogue 
on key economic policy issues and concerns such as public 
expenditure and resource management, regional cooperation, rural 
livelihood enhancement strategies, and support for devaluation.

Murshuk Shah said while the ADB's assistance had previously been 
coursed through the federal government, the Local Government Plan 
of 2000 provided an opportunity to provide assistance directly to 
the provincial and local governments.

"Because of its potential to greatly enhance the impact of 
development assistance, ADB's strategy will be to increasingly 
provide assistance directly to the provincial and local 
governments. As a step in this direction, ADB will assist in the 
improvement of provincial public resource management frameworks and 
build the necessary institutional capacity at the local level," he 
added.

He said ADB endorsed the government's poverty reduction' strategy 
and that the ADB's operational strategy for Pakistan would 
complement the government's efforts. However, the ADB's operational 
strategy would be selective and would focus on interventions aimed 
at addressing critical bottlenecks, and promoting growth in sectors 
or activities that have the maximum poverty reduction impact.

The main thrust of the CSP is to support poverty reduction in 
Pakistan through assistance in priority areas of shared strategic 
importance.

<a name="fres">Fresh bidding for UBL on Monday</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 29: Growing confusion and uncertainty about the UBL 
privatisation was removed when the Cabinet Committee on 
Privatisation (CCOP) decided to invite all three prequalified 
bidders to offer their fresh bids and the highest bidder will be 
issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) on the spot.

"There is going to be Rs 12.3 billion floor price for seeking 
government's majority shares in the United Bank Limited (UBL) and 
the minimum jump will be of Rs 50 million to increase the bid and 
this is how the highest bidder will be issued LoI at the spot," 
Minister for Privatisation Altaf M. Saleem said.

Talking to Dawn after the CCOP meeting, he said a benchmark price 
of Rs 12.3 billion has been decided on the basis of which LoI will 
be issued to the highest bidder.

Answering a question he said since all the three parties had been 
cleared by the State Bank, there was no need to seek any fresh 
query from them. He said unless there was any logistic problem to 
any bidder, the UBL transaction will be finalised on Monday next.

Earlier, the Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB) group had offered the 
highest bid of Rs 12 billion followed by Abu Dhabi and Bestway 
Consortium and Union Bank group who submitted their Rs 4.8 billion 
and Rs 4.5 billion, respectively. Later, the issue remained with 
the State Bank for quite some time.

Mr Altaf Saleem, who is also the chairman of Privatisation 
Commission, said there was also no need to seek any revised funding 
plan from any party.

To a question he said the MCB group has given assured that it was 
ready to meet any financial shortfall if asked by the central bank. 
They have also assured that it would not use the depositors money 
to buy 51 per cent majority shares of the UBL.

The UBL is a major transaction in the financial sector, to be 
followed by the privatisation of Habib Bank Limited (HBL), National 
Bank of Pakistan and other Financial Development Institutions 
(FDIs) including the National Investment Trust(NIT).

<a name="deci">Decision on UBL deal within two weeks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 24: The Privatisation Commission Board was informed 
that the lingering issue of privatising United Bank Ltd will 
definitely be decided within the next two weeks.

Informed sources said the board meeting, presided over by 
Privatisation Minister Altaf M. Saleem, was taken into confidence 
about the delay that was occurring to finalize the much awaited UBL 
deal. But Mr Saleem assured the meeting that the sanctity of the 
privatisation process for UBL will be maintained along with 
ensuring maximization of the transaction.

The sources said the State Bank had eventually evaluated the new 
funding plan submitted by the MCB group to acquire 51 per cent 
shares of UBL. However, the central bank has asked the 
Privatisation Commission through a letter to further clarify some 
issues from the MCB group, including the capital adequacy.

"There will be a merger of MCB and UBL if Mian Mansha group's Rs12 
billion bid is accepted and as such this issue requires serious due 
diligence," a source in the Ministry of Finance said.

The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) is expected to meet 
next week where the officials of the Privatisation Commission will 
brief the participants about the latest situation regarding the UBL 
privatisation. 

"From our point of view the field is still open for everyone," a 
source said, adding the representatives of Mian Mansha group, and 
Union Bank group (the third highest bidder of the UBL) had met the 
Privatisation Commission officials this week and discussed with 
them various issues relating to the deal.

The representatives of Abu Dhabi and Bestway consortium are 
expected to meet the Privatisation Commission officials to give 
their point of view. They had created an excitement by increasing 
their bid from Rs4.8 billion to Rs12.3 billion, which was 
considered "out of process" increase in bid money. However, the 
privatisation minister was on record having said that both the 
revised bids offered by the first and second highest bidders would 
be taken to the federal cabinet for any decision.

Some people believed that Abu Dhabi group's management consisted of 
former BCCI group, which had been indicted in the past and as such 
could cause severe reaction from the New York and London based 
bankers and financial experts if offered UBL. "But if that is the 
case then we must know that Bank Al-Falah is owned by Abu Dhabi 
group, which is efficiently running it," argued an official of the 
Ministry of Finance.

The sources said that there was a remote possibility that a 
decision about the UBL deal could be left on the future government 
as nobody was willing to take any blame for accepting MCB group's 
offer, though it was in accordance with the criteria set by the 
Privatisation Commission. 

On the other hand Abu Dhabi group's written offer of Rs12.3 billion 
and further verbal assurances that it could even go beyond that was 
stopping the people concerned to take any decision to avoid 
criticism and fear of National Accountability Bureau's involvement 
over the issue at a later stage.

The cabinet body also accorded approval to the inclusion of 
Peshawar Electric Supply Company Limited in the privatisation plan.

September. He expressed hopes that the Privatisation Commission 
would achieve the objective of getting maximum proceeds through a 
very transparent process.

The meeting was also attended by ministers for communications, 
labour and man power, industries, privatisation, State Bank 
governor, Planning Commission deputy chief and other senior

<a name="worl">WorldCom up-to-date in PTCL dues</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 24: WorldCom has paid amount due to Pakistan 
Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) on time in June 2002 and 
the payment for the next quarter would be due at the end of 
September.

Brokerage firm, Taurus Securities, quoting sources at PTCL said in 
a report that the telecom management did not foresee any risk of 
default, following the filing for bankruptcy protection (Chapter 
11) by WorldCom.

PTCL has interconnection arrangements with three US long-distance 
carriers, namely AT&T, WorldCom (MCI) and Sprint, to carry voice 
traffic between US and Pakistan. The US carriers collect the 
tariff- called the International Accounting Rates (IAR)-from its 
customers on the US side on incoming traffic, i.e. on calls 
originating in the US and terminating in Pakistan; and PTCL 
collects tariffs from its domestic customers on outgoing calls.

The carrier collecting tariff then pays half the collected amount-
known as the Settlement Rate-to its counterpart.

Taurus Securities said that the PTCL's incoming traffic, from US 
and in total from the rest of the world, far exceeded outgoing 
calls. PTCL had a large annual receivable settlement balance on its 
international operations, which was an important part of its total 
revenue base. Its revenues from international operations in 
financial year 2001 stood at Rs18.9 billion, or $325 million, while 
for financial year 2002, the projected balance was Rs18.4 billion 
or $307 million. Despite the higher incoming traffic, international 
revenues had been under pressure in recent years due to scheduled 
sharp reduction in the IAR, imposed by the US Federal Communication 
Commission, i.e from $2.2/min in financial year 1996 to $0.46/min 
in financial year 2003.

Settlement receipts from WorldCom currently account for 22 per cent 
of PTCL's total annual international revenues, which was equivalent 
to $65 million, said the analysts, adding: "Payments were settled 
quarterly, so PTCL's maximum receivable from WorldCom at any point 
in time would be around $16 million or Rs960 million."

<a name="stoc">Stocks gain 24 points on speculative buying in PTCL, Hubco</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 30: The KSE 100-share index posted a fresh rise of 
23.79 points at 1,974.59, reflecting the strength of leading base 
shares including PTCL and Hub-Power.

Bulk of the support remained confined to Hub-Power and PTCL as 
investors continued to make extensive buying followed by reports of 
higher earnings and hopes of enhanced dividend.

Energy, cement and chemical sectors remained in active demand where 
prices generally rose in some cases sharply higher but food, 
investment and textile shares showed fractional fall in the absence 
of strong demand and profit-selling at the higher level in the food 
shares, notably Nestle MilkPak and Rafhan Maize Products.

Leading gainers were led by Pakistan Oil fields followed by reports 
of its early sell-off and Shell Pakistan, which rose by Rs10.50 and 
Rs17.75 respectively. Heavy buying in Shell Pakistan is attributed 
to keep its share value well above that of PSO, which has during 
the last couple of sessions had risen above the Rs200 mark.

Shell Pakistan apparently in a bid to keep its premium over PSO was 
quoted at Rs254.70 on a business of 0.268m shares. But on the other 
hand the recent upturn was halted in PSO at Rs202.65.

Other prominent gainers were led by Adamjee Insurance, Shafiq 
Textiles, Lakson Tobacco, BOC Pakistan, Noon Sugar and some others, 
up Rs2 to Rs3.30.

Losers were led by Shell Gas, Attock Refinery, Clover Pakistan, 
Siemens Pakistan, Rafhan Maize and Nestle MilkPak, off Rs1.50 to 
Rs9.55, the largest fall of Rs25 being in Wyeth Pakistan. Trading 
volume rose to 232m shares from the previous 226m shares as the 
advancing shares maintained a strong lead over the losing ones at 
146 to 96, with 53 shares holding on to the last levels.

The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, higher 35 paisa at 
Rs28.75 on 82m shares followed by PTCL, up 40 paisa at Rs20.15 on 
69m shares, PSO, easy 15 paisa at Rs202.65 on 22m shares, D.G. Khan 
Cement, firm by 25 paisa at Rs11.65 on 9m shares and Sui Northern, 
steady 15 paisa at Rs15.65 on 8m shares.

Engro Chemical led the list of other actives, lower 20 paisa on 5m 
shares, ICI Pakistan, steady five paisa on 4m shares, Dewan Salman, 
firm by 20 paisa also on 4m shares, Adamjee Insurance, higher by 
Rs2 on 3.769m shares and National Bank, off 40 paisa on 3.666m 
shares.

CLEARED LIST: Steadier conditions prevailed on this counter as 
speculative forces remained active buyers and sellers in most of 
the pivotals. Hub-Power accounted for about 13m shares in both the 
settlements up 25 to 39 paisa, followed by PTCL, higher by 45 and 
39 paisa on over 7m shares. PSO fell modestly by 15 paisa for the 
August settlement, while rose by 25 paisa for the September 
delivery on over 3m shares.

DEFAULTER COMPANIES: For the second session in a row, the activity 
on this counter remained slack as investors were busy in the 
forward counter. Suzuki Motorcycles again came in for stray selling 
and fell 15 paisa at Rs4.60 on 9,000 shares, while Allied Motors 
attracted selling at Rs10.25, lower 25 paisa on 3,000 shares.

DIVIDEND: Arpak International, cash five per cent for the year 
ended June 30, 2002.

<a name="divi">Dividend-driven support adds Rs20bn to market capitalization</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Aslam

The KSE 100-share index breached through the psychological barrier 
of 1,900 points at 1,925.75 points, adding Rs20 billion to the 
market capitalization.

Just on the heels of handsome payouts by the leading MNCs, notably 
the Lever Brothers and the Shell Pakistan, and the predictions of 
an identical final by the Hub-Power next month, the PSO came out 
with an enhanced final of 80 per cent, plus bonus shares at the 
rate of 20 per cent, intensifying the current bull-run. It has 
already paid two interims totalling 50 per cent on massive after 
the tax profit of Rs32 billion.

An interim dividend at the rate of 116 per cent by the Lever 
Brothers Pakistan, seems to have signalled that the other MNCs may 
follow it allowing the bulls to push the index to a new peak level 
before the national elections.

The management of the Hub-Power, which has already paid an interim 
at the rate of 40 per cent a couple of months back could give a 
pleasant surprise to its shareholders next month when its board 
meets.

Plus signs dominated the list, major gainers being the Bannu 
Woollen, the Lakson Tobacco, the PSO, the Clariant Pakistan, Bata 
Pakistan, the Lever Brothers and the Treet Corporation, the largest 
gainer being in the Wyeth Pakistan, the Shell Pakistan, the 
Pakistan Oilfields, Millat Tractors, Dawood Hercules, the ICP SEMF, 
which resumed its upward drive after the last week's recessionary 
cycle. The ICI Pakistan, the Pak Reinsurance Company, the Engro 
Chemical, Honda Atlas and many others also rose.

Losers were led by the Orix Leasing, the Abbott Lab, the Security 
Papers and, the SK&F, the Siemens Pakistan, the Kohinoor Weaving, 
the Exide Pakistan, the Packages, the Berger Paints, the Pakistan 
Tobacco, and some others.

Trading volume swelled to over billion-share mark after several 
months, having fallen to a meagre total of 163 million shares a 
week earlier.

Massive activities in the Hub-Power after the mid-week, notably 
after the Shell and the PSO dividend was the week's highlight as 
bulk of the total turnover went to its credit.

Other actives were led by the PTCL, the PSO, the Engro Chemical, 
the ICI Pakistan, the Sui Northern Gas, the Fauji Fertiliser, the 
National Bank, the MCB, the ICI SEMF, the D.G.Khan Cement, the FFC-
Jordan Fertiliser, Dewan Salman, Adamjee Insurance and several 
others.

<a name="wene">We never learn from history-5</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

Air Marshal Asghar Khan's human rights petition (HRC 19/96) remains 
unheard. Chief Justice Sheikh Riaz Ahmad is currently in South 
Africa, and when he returns he will preside over this country as 
its acting president in the absence of the president who will be 
away in the United States.

He may, therefore, not have the time or inclination to form a bench 
to hear Asghar's case, to order that it be decided quickly, or to 
order that pending the decision handed down, those who are prima 
facie guilty of rigging elections in the past be disqualified for 
the time being from contesting the upcoming elections.

Our former Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sajjad Ali Shah, in his book 
'Law Courts in a Glass House', (OUP 2001) touches upon the Inter-
Services Intelligence department's role in this country's electoral 
process.

On June 11 1996, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's interior minister, 
retired Lt General Naseerullah Babar, announced on the floor of the 
National Assembly that the former chief of army staff, General 
Mirza Aslam Beg had, in 1990, during the run-up to the elections 
held that year, withdrawn an amount of Rs.140 million from Mehran 
Bank, handed it over to the Inter Services Intelligence chief, Lt 
General Asad Durrani, and asked him to suitably disburse the amount 
to a selection of anti-PPP politicians and thus rig the elections 
in favour of the ISI- tailored IJI and Nawaz Sharif (who himself 
was given three million rupees).

Shortly thereafter Justice Shah received a letter from Air Marshal 
Asghar Khan, copied to the then COAS, General Jehangir Karamat, 
drawing his attention to the matter. On the basis of this letter, 
the attached press clippings and an affidavit signed by Asad 
Durrani listing the politicians to whom money had been paid, the 
Supreme Court decided to register a case under Article 184(3) of 
the Constitution.

The petitioner, Asghar Khan, requested that Beg, Durrani and Younus 
Habib of Habib and Mehran Banks be named as respondents. The ISI 
requested that the hearing be in camera and the court agreed to the 
request in so far as proceedings regarding the legal position of 
the ISI were concerned.

Hearings commenced in February 1997 and continued through the year. 
On November 6, the statements of Babar and Durrani were to be 
recorded, and Justice Shah recounts how his court was faced with 
the awkward question as to the law under which the ISI and its 
political cell had been set up. Beg's counsel, the weighty Akram 
Shaikh, after fulsome praise of the agency and its great 
achievements - greater than those of RAW, the KGB or MI-5 - 
explained how the political cell had been established in 1975 under 
the orders of the then prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

The court asked the attorney general (Nawaz's lawyer Chaudhry 
Mohammed Farooq) to provide the relevant documentation as to the 
scope of the activities of the political cell and to clarify 
whether, under the law, part of its duties was to distribute funds 
for the purpose of rigging elections. The AG, of course, wriggled 
out of that one by stating that the matter was of such a 
'sensitive' and 'delicate' nature that it could not be heard in 
open court.

Asghar Khan's lawyer, Habibul Wahabul Khairi, countered by saying 
that as the entire matter had been aired in the press, with all the 
names involved fully listed, there was little left to warrant in-
camera proceedings, and besides, the people had every right to know 
how their money had been used and whether the use in question was 
permitted by law. The court, however, allowed the recording of 
Babar's and Durrani's statements and their cross-examination to be 
held in camera, which were done on November 19 and 20.

That was the last hearing of this important case. Eight days later, 
on November 28, 1997, the Supreme Court was stormed by men of the 
government of Nawaz Sharif. A group of judges of the Supreme Court 
(whose intention for some months had been to oust Sajjad Ali Shah) 
via a series of orders issued by the Peshawar and Quetta benches 
forced him to step down as chief justice. Sajjad went on leave 
prior to retirement and Justice Ajmal Mian took his place.

The Herald, the monthly magazine of this newspaper's group, in its 
issue of April 2000, published a report by Mubashir Zaidi ('Forging 
democracy') which made a mention of Asghar Khan's petition: "The 
case has since been heard and on October 11, 1999, just a day 
before the military overthrew the 'heavily mandated' Sharif 
government, the sitting chief justice, Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, 
announced that he had reserved judgment on the ISI case."

Justice Siddiqui, the presiding judge, now off the bench as he did 
not take the oath under the January 2000 PCO, confirms that he did 
make such an announcement. Before he could write his judgment, 
General Babar saw him in his chamber and prevailed upon him to send 
notice to and examine Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari and others 
mentioned on the lists before announcing his judgment. In the 
interest of justice, he ordered that the desired notices be issued.

Thereafter, the case was apparently 'morgued'. Asghar Khan on 
several occasions reminded Saiduzzaman's successor, the new Chief 
Justice, Irshad Hasan Khan (now our chief election commissioner), 
and requested him to take up the case but he received no response. 
Justice Khan was far too busy attending to more vital affairs.

So, the important issues remain unresolved. Those accused of the 
giving and taking of the people's money for illegal and unlawful 
purposes (unless the relevant ISI law states otherwise) are prima 
facie guilty, but they have not been convicted and are free to rig 
and contest elections, possibly be elected and will be again 
allowed to rob the nation. Should the givers and takers not be 
brought to book and disqualified? There is still time.

There is one lesson we should learn from history. The last time we 
had free and fair elections was in the days of General Agha 
Mohammad Yahya Khan, as a consequence of which we lost half our 
country. We must ensure by whatever means we can command that the 
free and fair elections which are scheduled to be held in October 
do not result in the loss of the remaining half.

<a name="anel">An election alliance to beat all others</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

"He's still tight with us in the war against terror and that's what 
I appreciate. He understands that we've got to keep Al Qaeda on the 
run...and I appreciate his strong support."- President Bush about 
his friend General Musharraf.

No, the strongest alliance is not between the quislings of the Q 
League and General Headquarters. It is not between this or that 
political party. Dominating the national as much as the election 
scene is the strategic partnership between the Bush White House and 
the Musharraf Presidency. Everything else in Pakistan is 
subordinate and secondary to this overwhelming equation.

Only the very gullible will be taken in by the mild queasiness the 
State Department every now and then expresses about General 
Musharraf's cavalier treatment of such things as the Constitution. 
Cutting through the fog it should be clear even to non-conspiracy 
theorists that the Americans are backing Musharraf to the hilt. 
Why? Because he is their man and his presence at the helm of 
affairs remains vital to the Americans' unfinished business in 
Afghanistan.

Who else could match the zeal of the Pakistan army in keeping such 
a watchful eye on the Pak-Afghan border, largely at American 
behest? Which other country would have given such a free run to the 
FBI and other American agencies to set up shop within its borders 
and help catch, again with unmatched zeal, America's putative 
enemies?

No wonder American officials are so effusive. "We think they are 
doing a very splendid job in the very difficult tribal areas... I 
was able to again thank President Musharraf and his very excellent 
army and the police forces." This from the US deputy secretary of 
state, Richard Armitage, after meeting General Musharraf in 
Islamabad last week. In New Delhi he didn't meet the prime minister 
or couldn't. No such problem here in Islamabad where the usual red 
carpet for American officials, no matter what their status, was 
rolled out for him.

Now comes the clincher, General Tommy Franks' rather candid 
statement at the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan that over time the 
'war against terrorism' may need to be extended beyond the 
frontiers of Afghanistan. To Iran or the states of Central Asia? 
You must be kidding. The country that fits the job description can 
only be Pakistan. His next sentence made this clear: "The 
relationship we have with states surrounding Afghanistan will 
permit us over time to do (this) work. "Pakistan has a strong claim 
to being the strongest American client in the region. Karzai of 
course is the most obvious puppet. But then he can't take care of 
his own security. How can the Pentagon entrust him with anything 
bigger?

>From Islamabad have come furious denials: there was no need for 
American or other foreign troops to enter Pakistan in pursuit of 
the elusive shadows of Al Qaeda, the implication being that 
Pakistan's own troops were sufficient for the job. But a peep into 
the Pentagon's thinking has been provided. Pakistan is being 
thought of as a possible theatre of future operations. Pakistan had 
better be on its guard. There is a Punjabi saying that the 
friendship and enmity of the police are equally bad. You lose out 
in both ways. Is it more dangerous to be America's friend or its 
enemy?

Yet the cruel paradox remains that for all its back-bending 
services, Pakistan has not received the recognition and 
appreciation it deserves. Look at Israel, fixed firmly and 
permanently in the eye of American favour. Look at Pakistan, 
treated so shabbily. Dollops of aid, yes, patronizing words of 
praise, certainly, but hardly adequate to the great services 
Pakistan's military rulers have rendered.

Look at the way Pakistan is treated. In deciding between India and 
Pakistan in recent months it is India that the US has favoured and 
Pakistan on whom it has leaned. Every time an American official 
comes calling Pakistan has to put up with lectures on cross-border 
infiltration. Not a word about the fundamentals of the Kashmir 
dispute.

Am I suggesting that Pakistan be treated like Israel? Well, we have 
graduated to a class of loyalty where our services should be put at 
par with those of America's closest allies. For such services, why 
not Israeli wages? But we remain stuck in the scullery, just next 
to the servants' quarters.

Consider again the mellifluous phrasing of Armitage's latest 
certificate of approval: "I was able to again thank President 
Musharraf and his very excellent army and police forces." Any red 
faces in the higher echelons of command? I doubt it. We took care 
of such minor matters as injured honour or qualms of conscience a 
long time ago.

There is no denying the national security apparatus's extraordinary 
talent for excess. In the heyday of Pakistan's Afghan involvement 
this apparatus oversold the extent of its prowess. Just as it 
oversold the capabilities and implications of the country's nuclear 
program. In the aftermath of September 11 the same establishment 
has undersold Pakistan, allowing itself to be fobbed off with small 
change.

Any surprises in this? Hardly. The pattern is depressingly familiar 
and consistent. What did Pakistan get for being the major factor in 
the American-sponsored coalition (back in the eighties) which 
fought the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan? What did it get for 
acting as the bridge between the US and China in 1971? What did it 
get for being America's most allied ally during the cold war when 
anti-communist alliances were all the rage and Pakistan was a 
member of CENTO and SEATO?

It's the same story again but no matter. By going the whole hog 
with the Americans in their "war on terror" Musharraf ended his 
international isolation. At the end of it all Pakistan may be left 
wondering what it has got for its pains but Musharraf's own 
position as an internationally-accepted leader has been secured. 
Collective confusion, individual gain.

No doubt gaffes like the referendum have been committed, acting 
upon bad political advice being one of this government's foremost 
problems. Open-heart surgery has been done on that sorely-abused 
document, the Pakistan Constitution. But Musharraf has got away 
with them because of two decisive factors: the command of 
Pakistan's divisions and American approval. This is a deadly 
combination, proof against all forms of domestic opposition.

Imagine if Musharraf had been Robert Mugabe. He would have been 
dragged over the coals for much less.

The bargain then is this: external dependence, internal autonomy. 
We are your devoted fellow-travellers abroad but leave us free to 
do what we want at home. This has always been American policy in 
the Middle East towards its Arab allies. It has been American 
policy towards Pakistani strongmen in the past and it is the 
American approach to Musharraf now.

The October elections are just a blip on the US's radar screen. The 
Americans want them to take place not so much for the sake of the 
Pakistani people - such altruism not entering imperial calculations 
- as for keeping their friend Musharraf on a short leash. It helps 
to have a friendly strongman in place. But it also helps to keep 
his power circumscribed so that he does not step too far out of 
line.

The US wants a democratic facade in Pakistan. This is what the 
October elections are set to deliver. But the US is not exactly 
overwhelmed by democratic scruples. Like any other power, it 
pursues its interests. If democracy happens to coincide with those 
interests, fine. Otherwise, too bad for democracy.

How many divisions does the Pope have? Stalin asked. As army chief 
General Musharraf remains master of many divisions. On their 
strength and the psychological lift that comes from his American 
connection, he has already determined the contours of Pakistan's 
future political map. The political parties are just fighting for 
some space in between. That's all the freedom they are being 
allowed. The script and music score have been written and the 
nation is expected to march to the tune of this martial music. This 
at least is the staff solution. But as often happens with the best 
laid-out plans, there is one flaw in it. Will the Pakistani people 
go along? Will they be the asses the government expects them to be 
or will they use their minds when it comes to expressing their 
opinion? This is the big question waiting to be answered.

<a name="awar">A war America's allies oppose</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Eric S. Margolis

US forces are rapidly massing in the Gulf to invade Iraq. Four 
heavy brigades have been positioned near Iraq, a huge new air 
complex is now operational in Qatar, and American special forces 
are active in Iraqi Kurdistan.

The White House is hoping its threats of war will provoke a coup 
against Saddam Hussein by the Iraqi army. But if one does not come, 
the Bush administration shows every sign of plunging into an 
unprovoked war that the rest of the world will view as blatant 
aggression.

Even America's closest allies are appalled by the tide of 
warmongering and jingoism that has engulfed the United States. 
Bush's recently proclaimed doctrine of 'pre-emptive intervention' 
anywhere on earth is nothing less than a frightening revival of the 
old imperialist Brezhnev Doctrine of 25 years ago that called for 
Soviet intervention wherever socialism was threatened.

'Bush, himself the most intellectually backward American president 
of my political lifetime, is surrounded by advisers whose 
bellicosity is exceeded only by their political, military and 
diplomatic illiteracy.' Such were the stinging words of Gerald 
Kaufman, the highly respected former foreign affairs spokesman of 
Britain's ruling Labour Party, America's closest ally.

Bush's accelerating campaign to invade Iraq and turn it into 
another US oil protectorate is also provoking a storm of outrage 
across Europe, the Mideast, and Asia where people believe pollution 
and climate change are far bigger and more urgent threats than the 
boogeyman of Baghdad.

There are two important exceptions. First, Israel. Some days ago, 
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, sounding like he was giving orders to 
a subordinate, demanded Bush speed up plans to attack Iraq. Right 
on cue, American supporters of Sharon's far-right Likud Party, led 
by the Bush administration's Rasputin, Richard Perle, intensified 
their clamour to send American GIs to fight Iraq. 

These bloodthirsty 'neo-conservatives' - most of whom evaded 
military service in their own country - currently dominate the 
Pentagon and exercise a virtual monopoly on US media commentary of 
the Mideast. They are ardently backed by Armageddon-seekers of the 
Christian loony far right.

Senior Republican Senator Chuck Hagel spoke for many when he asked 
if Perle was so eager to attack, why didn't he join the first 
assault wave against Baghdad. Former national security adviser to 
Bush's father, Brent Scowcroft, warned an attack on Iraq would be a 
disastrous mistake.

Meanwhile, in Congressional hearings recently, former UN Iraq arms 
inspector Scott Ritter courageously stated what many Americans 
believe, but dare not say: "A handful of ideologues have hijacked 
the national security policy of the United States for their own 
ambitions." Ritter insisted Iraq was totally disarmed and no threat 
to the US or Mideast. The Bush administration - more precisely, the 
people pulling its strings - do not want renewed inspections of 
Iraq, Ritter said, they only want war.

A torrent of propaganda, lies and half-truths about Iraq have been 
pouring from the White House in a campaign reminiscent of old 
Soviet agitprop. The government-appointed 'defence' team 
representing accused 9/11 plot member Zacharias Moussaui, 
reportedly urged him to falsely claim that Iraq was behind the 
attack. Moussaui refused. The head of Czech intelligence said there 
were no contacts in Prague between Iraq and Al Qaida, a key Bush 
reason for attacking Iraq. CIA veterans and European intelligence 
officials scoff at White House claims that Iraq is a threat to the 
world.

The other exception to worldwide outrage over America's Mideast 
policies was Osama bin Laden's Al Qaida. In 1998, Osama carefully 
outlined his grand strategy to: a) liberate Palestine; b) drive the 
US occupying troops from Saudi Arabia; and c) end the punishment of 
Iraq's people. To attain these goals, Osama bin Laden planned to 
provoke the US into a large number of fruitless military 
involvements that would wear out the US and bleed its military and 
financial power.

Afghanistan, which costs American taxpayers five billion dollars 
monthly, is the first step. Iraq, whose leader is hated by Osama 
bin Laden - a hatred equally returned by Saddam - will be number 
two. Then, Iran, Syria, Libya - all also on Perle's hit list - and 
so on until a host of Lilliputian conflicts tie down the American 
imperial giant.

George Bush, who takes pride in not reading books, and calls Greeks 
'Grecians,' is charging like a Texas bull into the trap set for him 
by both Osama bin Laden and General Sharon. Israel has been trying 
for 20 years to get the US to go to war against the Arabs and Iran, 
knowing this will permanently enlist America's vast wealth and 
power in its cause, and permanently alienate the US from the 
Islamic world.

The extremists in both camps need one another. The main beneficiary 
of the 9/11 attacks on the US was Israel's Sharon. Bin Laden would 
never have achieved notoriety and a wide following without Israel's 
oppression of the Palestinians.

If ever the United States needed real friends, it is now. Real 
friends, like Canada, Germany, and France, are trying to deter the 
empty, misled George Bush and his hijacked cabinet from committing 
an outright aggression that risks plunging the Mideast - into 
chaos, even nuclear war.- Copyright Eric S. Margolis, 2002.

<a name="stic">Sticking to Plan A</a>	
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

When in France, I am often asked where I come from, and when I say 
"Pakistan", more often than not the response is "Ah, Pakistan! 
Beaucoup de problemes la!"

In part, the perception that Pakistan is, first and foremost, a 
country with many problems is due to the recent terrorist attack in 
Karachi that left a dozen French engineers dead. But more than any 
single incident, the last quarter century has been a period of 
mounting crises in Pakistan, most of them self- created. A 
combination of political ineptitude and short-sighted and self-
serving military rule has generated new contradictions and made the 
old ones more difficult to resolve.

The recent series of attacks against Christian and western targets 
provides us with a glimpse of the hellish black hole we have 
reached. While many Pakistanis resent the increasingly negative 
image we have abroad, the fact is that for much of the world, 
nothing good is associated with our country which is, more than 
ever before, seen as a centre of religious intolerance and violent 
extremism. The two murderous attacks against Christian 
establishments in Murree and Taxila recently have only reinforced 
this view.

In the aftermath of 9/11, many of us supported Musharraf's forced 
conversion to the American anti-Taliban cause in Afghanistan 
because we felt that finally we would see a much- needed cleansing 
of extremist, jihadi elements from our society. As violent events 
over this last year have reminded us, fanaticism is not easily 
managed and directed: jihadi groups have their own agenda and play 
along with intelligence agencies only to the extent it suits them. 
To imagine that they would support Gen Musharraf's pro-American 
stance and lower their profile in Kashmir at the same time displays 
an alarming naivete.

Ever since they regrouped after the hammering they took in 
Afghanistan, they have been driven by a burning desire for 
vengeance. Since the Americans are too powerful and too far from 
the region, Musharraf and his government are the obvious target. By 
attacking soft western and local Christian targets, they have 
sought to destabilize a government they see as their foe. Their 
calculation seems to be if they can topple the Musharraf 
government, the ensuing chaos would give them the opportunity to 
regroup and carve out a base in Pakistan, much as they had in 
Afghanistan.

In order to counter the jihadis and their politics of violence, one 
would have thought the obvious move for the army would be to seek a 
united front with all the mainstream political groups and leaders. 
Unfortunately, with elections around the corner, Musharraf and his 
minions are still playing power games by hobnobbing with minor 
parties in a bid to keep the two major political groupings out in 
the cold. This fixation with individuals at the cost of national 
interests could cost us very heavily indeed.

The political vacuum that might result if the government succeeds 
in its aim of denying power to Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif 
despite their demonstrable popularity will give the religious 
parties an opportunity to do far better at the polls than they have 
ever done in the past. Such a showing will provide them with the 
legitimacy and credibility they have always lacked in previous 
elections where they have rarely managed to get over five per cent 
of the popular vote.

In the West, there is a genuine fear today that Pakistan might go 
the way of Algeria where a major civil war has been raging for over 
a decade between the army and religious elements. But these 
analysts miss a serious difference: in Algeria, the religious right 
had won the elections but was denied power by the military. 
Mercifully, in Pakistan, these elements have never been even close 
to electoral victory. On the other hand, the Algerian army and the 
ruling party, the revolutionary FLN, are both secular in outlook 
whereas the Pakistan army now contains many officers in Ziaul Haq's 
mould who would be happy to see Pakistan following the Taliban 
route.

Had Gen Musharraf used the momentum of the Taliban defeat to roll 
back extremist groups in Pakistan, he would have had a far better 
chance of success. Elements of Al Qaeda who have filtered down to 
Pakistan have had the time to establish links with local groups and 
plan elaborate and vicious attacks. Suicide bombers, unheard of in 
Pakistan until recently, now ply their deadly trade at regular 
intervals.

Ever since the events of 9/11, Gen Musharraf has been sending out 
mixed signals: after jailing hundreds of extremists earlier this 
year, his government released most of them within weeks. Time and 
again, he has backed off after making sane, secular pronouncements. 
This has emboldened the zealots who see his equivocation as a sign 
of weakness. It seems that all his tough talk and action are 
reserved for those he sees as his principal enemies, Benazir Bhutto 
and Nawaz Sharif. He needs to understand that he has far more in 
common with them than he does with the religious fanatics who are a 
much greater danger to him and the entire country.

As his three-year tenure draws to a close, Gen Musharraf should 
remember that all the great generals were flexible enough to change 
their plans during the course of a battle if the situation so 
demanded. A blind adherence to Plan A is often a recipe for 
disaster. Just because he began his stint with a strong (and 
understandable) aversion to Pakistan's two major politicians does 
not mean that he should not now recognize that the bigger threat 
comes from elsewhere.

In Pakistan, as anywhere in the world, we are so caught up in our 
day-to-day problems that we don't bother how the rest of the world 
sees us. We also forget how important this international perception 
is. But it counts for a great deal, specially if we are an 
economically fragile country that requires not only foreign 
assistance but a great deal of foreign investment. 

Currently, few outsiders would visit our shores for love or money. 
How many would invest a single dollar in a country where church-
goers are regular targets?

<a name="waqa">Waqar's gutless men suffer worst defeat</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI, Aug 30: Matthew Hayden scored faster than a run-a-ball to 
lash 146 and Jason Gillespie took five for 22 as Australia crushed 
Pakistan by 224 runs in the second match of a triangular tournament 
on Friday.

Pakistan won the toss but little else all day as Australia amassed 
332 for five, Hayden's innings coming off 128 balls to set his side 
up for the fourth biggest winning run margin in one-day 
international history.

It was Pakistan's heaviest defeat, eclipsing their 198-run defeat 
against England at Trent Bridge in 1992.

Strike bowler Gillespie then took wickets with his second and 
fourth balls, opener Imran Nazir caught for a single by 
wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist and Shahid Afridi for a duck, to send 
Pakistan slumping to 13 for four by the seventh over.

None of the top four made more than five as Pakistan were dismissed 
for 108 in 36 overs.

It was Pakistan's lowest ever score against Australia in one-day 
internationals following the previous record low at the 1999 World 
Cup in England when the Aussies won by 132 runs.

"We didn't expect such a sensational victory," Australia captain 
Ricky Ponting said. "It is surprising because we thought we would 
have to work hard.

"Pakistan bowled too many lose balls. They did not have a good 
day."

Hayden said patience had paid off for him. "I was patient and just 
wanted to bat for as long as I would stay on and let the scoreboard 
take care of itself," Hayden said with a grin. "We are here to 
improve our cricket and play like professionals."

Pakistan captain Waqar Younis was gracious in defeat. "It was a 
disastrous game for us," he said. "We bowled poorly, batted and 
fielded poorly. We gave away far too many extras. I thought winning 
the toss was good for us but we just couldn't put the ball in the 
right place."

After Gillespie's early burst, Glenn McGrath continued the 
procession as Abdur Razzaq returned to the pavilion for five, clean 
bowled, and Saeed Anwar followed for three off 13 balls after being 
trapped lbw.

Gillespie returned with the last three wickets of Wasim Akram, 
Waqar Younis and Shoaib Akhtar, the final man falling to the last 
ball of his 10th and final over.

Earlier, the 31-year-old left-handed Hayden cemented his new 
opening role with a devastating display of hitting in an innings 
including six sixes and 12 fours.

Ponting scored 50 off 57 balls, which included five fours and two 
sixes, in putting on 128 with Hayden for the second wicket.

Hayden, previously seen as a test specialist but who displaced Mark 
Waugh in the one-day side, had his most productive spell in the 
44th over when he struck 21 off strike bowler Shoaib Akhtar, 
including a towering six and three fours.

<a name="stru">Pakistan struggle to defeat Kenya</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI, Aug 29: Pakistan made heavy weather of beating Kenya in 
the opening match of the triangular tournament, losing six wickets 
on the way to overhauling Kenya's total of 133.

Pakistan, who dismissed their opponents in 30.3 overs after Man-of-
the-Match Abdur Razzaq took four wickets and Wasim Akram took 
three, lost their first wicket in the first over of their reply 
when Saeed Anwar fell to Martin Suji's fifth ball without a run on 
the board.

Kenya's vice-captain Thomas Odoyo bowled Imran Nazir in the fourth 
over and Suji, who took two for 22 off his 10 overs, added Shahid 
Afridi (27 off 22 balls with three fours and two sixes) to his 
victims in the ninth over when Odoyo caught him at third man.

Pakistan had slumped to 97 for six before vice-captain Inzamam-ul-
Haq (14 not out) and Rashid Latif (28 not out off 23 balls with 
three fours and two sixes) saw them home to a four-wicket victory 
with 16.3 overs to spare.

"We bowled and fielded pretty well but you just don't win a match 
by good fielding and bowling. You need to bat equally well," said 
Pakistan captain Waqar Younis.

"Our batting collapsed and we shall have to correct this for 
tomorrow's match against Australia."

Opener Kennedy Obuya top-scored for Kenya with 36 - the highest 
individual score of the game matched only by Younis Khan, who hit 
six boundaries in his 75-ball knock - while the next four batsmen 
managed just six runs between them after Pakistan had won the toss.

Kenya's top order was swept away in overcast conditions by captain 
Waqar Younis and left-armer Wasim who combined to claim four 
wickets between the fourth and eighth overs. Razzaq finished with 
four for 35.

Waqar removed Ravindu Shah in the fourth over before Wasim trapped 
Kenyan captain Steve Tikolo (0) and his deputy Thomas Odoyo (4) lbw 
in the fifth and seventh overs.

Maurice Odumbe, one of Kenya's most prolific batsmen, went for a 
three-ball duck to give Wasim his third wicket.

"We did not play well but don't forget that we were playing the big 
boys," said Tikolo.

"We want to improve with every game and we will certainly play a 
better game on Sunday against them," he added in reference to the 
Sept 1 match against Pakistan.

Australia are the other team in the tournament. They play Pakistan 
on Friday.

<a name="ptfh">PTF has no intention of slapping ban on Aisam</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 27: Pakistan tennis chief Syed Dilawar Abbas said 
that Aisamul Haq's pairing with Israel's Amir Hadad abroad was 
something out of the federation's orbit and an official ban 
therefore could not be slapped on him.

Speaking following reports that Aisam was to team up again with 
Hadad, this time in the US Open, Dilawar said that there were 
certain decisions that had to be taken as a professional. "Aisam 
has got a wildcard for the Open and only he knows best what is 
right for him."

Aisam, 22, along with Amir, a 24-year-old Jew, had made it to the 
third round of the Wimbledon Championships but his achievements 
were overshadowed because of his controversial partnership. 
Pakistan and Israel have no diplomatic ties.

"During the Wimbledon, the PSB (Pakistan Sports Board) had asked us 
about this partnership and we told them that as a professional 
player he was not in our orbit," said Dilawar who is only into his 
fifth month in office.

Dilawar denied ever being under pressure from the International 
Tennis Federation (ITF) not to ban Aisam. "We have had no 
correspondence with the ITF on this subject and besides we never 
considered imposing a ban on him."

Aisam is Pakistan's best hope in the upcoming Davis Cup Asia 
Oceania Group II final against China next month in Peshawar, a tie 
Dilawar hopes can be won. "I think we have a good chance of 
winning."

Dilawar dismissed calls from certain quarters for moving the tie to 
Lahore. "I don't think there is any need to change the venue 
because we want to give equal opportunity to all the provinces."

"Why is the Davis Cup have to be staged each time either in Lahore 
or Islamabad," he questioned. "It is very fair that Peshawar 
organises the competition."

While backing Peshawar all the way, Dilawar also expressed his 
intentions of supporting the players. "Whatever money the NWFP 
association generates and gives us, it will be shared with the 
players." The PTF also gives a portion of money it receives from 
the ITF for holding Davis Cup ties.

The PTF, Dilawar pointed out was in the process of asking the ITF 
to support two of their upcoming players, Wasif Cheema and Shahzad 
Khan. "We want that each year we are able to discover at least two 
new players capable of competing at the top level so that we can 
broaden our Davis Cup base."

Offering associate membership to multi-national companies for Rs 
0.175 million each is also on Dilawar's 'things to do' list. "They 
will have no voting rights but would become members of the Council 
for four years," he explained. "We will give them subsidised 
tournaments so that they get publicity."

<a name="youh">Youhana sent home from Kenya</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohammad Yqoob

LAHORE, Aug 27: Pakistan batsman Yousuf Youhana refused to comment 
on his expulsion from the team on alleged disciplinary ground.

Youhana was sent packing from Nairobi, Kenya, where the Pakistan 
team is preparing for the tri-nation golden jubilee tournament 
starting Aug 29.

"I can't say anything until I meet chairman of the Pakistan Cricket 
Board (PCB) Lt Gen Tauqir Zia," he said.

Youhana said his meeting with the PCB chairman was scheduled for 
Wednesday.

Youhana is the second Pakistan cricketer to have been sent packing 
from a tour. In 1984-85, leg-spinner Abdul Qadir was also flown 
back after violating the code of conduct.

In 1997-98, two players - Shoaib Akhtar and Fazle Akbar - managed 
to stay on tour in Zimbabwe after Rashid Latif had decided to send 
them back for indiscipline.

<a name="jans">Jansher gets offer from Holland</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, Aug 30: Jansher Khan has received an offer from a club in 
Holland to represent it in the Dutch League and to conduct a 
coaching clinic there.

The Squash World Club has offered free travel expenses to Jansher 
and also asked about his remuneration per match.

Jansher on Friday expressed his availability for four matches of 
the Dutch League to be held between Nov 19 to Jan 28, 2003, but did 
not confirm his availability for a Oct 22 match as the date would 
clash with the CAS tournament which is to be held in the same month 
in Peshawar.

Jansher has demanded a wild card entry from the Pakistan Squash 
Federation (PSF) for the CAS tournament. A decision in this regard 
is yet to be finalised. Jansher has demanded 4,000 dollars per 
match and 1500 dollars per day for coaching in the clinic.

Jansher who had announced retirement from the international circuit 
five years ago due to a knee injury withdrew it on Aug 10. He had 
plans to play in three international competitions which are 
scheduled to be held in Pakistan from Sept to Dec.

The PSF did not allow Jansher a wild card entry for the next month 
international competition to be held in Karachi.

"I will confirm to the Dutch Club for Oct 22 tie in next 10 days 
after getting a final decision from the PSF about the wild card 
entry", he said.

Jansher said that he had lot of opportunities to play any where in 
the world but he desired to start his campaign for international 
circuit from Pakistan.

The former World champion said that to prepare himself for these 
competitions and for regular medical check up of his operated knees 
he had decided to stay in London.

<a name="toge">Jansher to get wild card</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, Aug 25: World squash legend Jansher Khan will get a wild 
card entry for the CAS Open tournament to be held in Peshawar in 
October. The Pakistan Squash Federation (PSF) vice president Air 
Martial Qaiser Hussain said that if Jansher would apply for the 
wild card he would get it for the said tournament. 

The federation had earlier denied a wild card to Jansher for the 
CNS tournament to be held in Karachi in September. 

Jansher had announced his retirement some five years ago, mainly 
due to a knee injury. He made headlines by withdrawing his 
retirement early this month. 

Jansher announced that he would compete in three international 
tournaments being held in Pakistan this year. But his return to the 
arena was disturbed when the PSF denied a wild card entry for the 
first competition namely CNS tournament.

The PSF allowed Jansher to compete in the qualifying round instead 
of demanding a wild card entry. But Jansher refused to play in the 
qualifying round saying it would be a disgraceful for him.

Qaiser clarified that a wild card entry to Jansher was denied for 
the Karachi's event because it would deprive any of the upcoming 
talented boys. He said that the youngsters were attending the 
training camp for the last many months and a wild card entry was 
their right. He said that the time was also short to make a final 
decision of Jansher's request. 

The PSF has given the wild card entry to Khayal Mohammad for 
Karachi competition.

The disgusted Jansher recently announced in Dubai that he would 
compete in smaller competitions in Europe in order to get himself 
in the international circuit.

<a name="hope">Waqar hopes contract issue will be resolved</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NAIROBI, Aug 24: Pakistan captain Waqar Younis, who is preparing 
for the triangular series involving Australia and hosts Kenya, is 
confident the International Cricket Council (ICC) contract row will 
be quickly resolved.

"We've not even spoken about it as we have been very busy ...but 
I'm sure that after working out for Australia, it should work out 
for all teams," Waqar told reporters after the team's practice 
session at the Sir Ali Muslim Sports Club on Saturday.

"I know players are not happy with certain aspects of the clause 
but I am sure the ICC will come up with some good decisions for all 
teams around the world so things should be alright in the next few 
days."

A row involving several top cricketers erupted after the ICC 
introduced a controversial contract.

Top players, including India's Sachin Tendulkar and captain Saurav 
Ganguly, have refused to sign the contract because of a clause 
protecting sponsors which prevents them from endorsing products of 
rival companies 30 days either side of ICC events such as next 
year's World Cup.

The stand, backed by players from other Test countries, had 
threatened a mass boycott of the Sept 12-29 tournament in Colombo, 
but that prospect receded Thursday when Australia reached an 
agreement and said they planned to send a full-strength team.

England and South Africa have also indicated that they are close to 
ending the dispute with their players.

Pakistan jetted into Nairobi from Morocco on Friday for the series 
which was moved from Lahore due to security concerns. New Zealand 
were also supposed to take part but withdrew from the event.

Waqar admitted Pakistan failed to live up to their potential at the 
Morocco Cup, where they finished last after failing to qualify for 
the final.

Sri Lanka beat South Africa by 27 runs Wednesday to win the Cup.

"We struggled in the middle order but we will correct such mistakes 
here," Waqar said. "After all we've been playing well in the last 
one year where we had a great series in Pakistan against New 
Zealand, we played well in Australia and Sharjah.

"It was just unfortunate that the team failed to click in Morocco. 
We are still a very good team capable of beating any good side.

"The return of pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar is especially handy. 
Having him striking for us is positive and very handy. We welcome 
him back.

"We take this tournament very seriously as it serves as our home 
series. With the World Cup around the corner, we will play 
professionally, especially against Australia who are the greatest 
opponents and event against Kenya who have come up pretty well in 
the past two years." he added.-Reuters
