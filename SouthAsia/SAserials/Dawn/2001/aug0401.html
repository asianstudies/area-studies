<a name="revi">Revival of democracy next year: Musharraf</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, July 31: President Gen Pervez Musharraf reaffirmed his 
resolve to abide by the Supreme Court directive regarding the 
restoration of democracy by October next year.

The reaffirmation came during talks between the president and US 
assistant secretary of state for South Asia Christina Rocca. The 
discussions focused on bilateral relations. 
Issues relating to regional peace and security, including the 
initiatives taken at the Pakistan-India summit at Agra, and the 
Afghanistan situation also came under discussions during Ms Rocca's 
meeting with the president and later separate talks with many 
ministers, particularly Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar.

The US assistant secretary and her aides also held formal 
discussions with the foreign ministry officials headed by the 
additional secretary for Americas, Ali Sarwar Naqvi. The topics 
discussed included the latest developments in Pakistan-India 
relations, nuclear non proliferation and the US sanctions. 

At her meeting with Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider, Ms Rocca 
said that the United States believed in bilateralism and close 
cooperation with Pakistan in the interest of promoting regional 
peace and security. The interior minister briefed her on internal 
security, efforts to check narco-traffic, sectarianism, terrorism 
and other issues of mutual interest. Economic situation came under 
review at the US official's meeting with Finance Minister Shaukat 
Aziz.

<a name="paki">Pakistan's claim to Jinnah House may never be accepted</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, July 30. Pakistan's claim to the Jinnah House in Mumbai may 
never be accepted because of a counter-claim by the founder of the 
nation's ageing daughter, Dinah Wadia, and her millionaire son, 
Nusli Wadia.

During his recent visit to India, President Gen Pervez Musharraf 
had renewed Pakistan's claim to the house which was built by the 
Quaid-i-Azam in 1936 when he returned to Bombay from England to 
take charge of the Muslim League. The president had suggested to 
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee that it should be given 
to Pakistan so that it could be turned into a consulate. But only 
last week, Dinah Wadia who lives in New York, wrote to the Indian 
prime minister demanding that the house on the Malabar Hill, now 
worth $15 million, be given to her.

According to The Observer, London, the daughter of the Quaid-i-
Azam, and his grandson, Nusli Wadia, who lives in Mumbai, have made 
it very clear to the Indian government that they consider President 
Musharraf's claim to the house " inappropriate".

Nusli Wadia said last week :"Jinnah's house has absolutely nothing 
to do with Pakistan. It was my grandfather's personal residence and 
one that he loved dearly. How does that involve Pakistan?" 
According to the newspaper, Nusli had recently hinted that his 
grandfather, who believed in democracy, would be less than 
delighted at the way his beloved Pakistan had turned out.

The daughter and the grandson's claim to the historical house has 
been endorsed by the ultra-nationalist Hindu Shiv Sena leader, Bal 
Thackeray, who has said: "Today they(Pakistan) are asking for the 
Jinnah House. Tomorrow they may want Taj Mahal and the day after 
Qutub Minar."

The house was built by a British architect, Claude Batley, a Muslim 
contractor,a Hindu plumber and Italian stonemasons. The total cost 
in 1936 had come to Rs 200,000.The two- and-a-half acre property, 
overlooking the sea, is at a prime location, and in 1948 was leased 
to the British High Commission which occupied it till 1982. Indian 
government sources say that the claim by the Quaid's heirs will be 
treated sympathetically. " We have no intention of handing it to 
Pakistan,' said a spokesman.

<a name="vajp">Vajpayee says he will visit Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, July 29: Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee 
distanced himself from claims by party colleagues and reports that 
he would not or should not visit Pakistan nor meet President Pervez 
Musharraf elsewhere for the moment.

Mr Vajpayee told an impromptu news conference during a tour of 
flood-ravaged Orissa state that his visit to Islamabad was very 
much there, and emphasized that the question was not if, but when, 
he would find the time to return the call here by Gen Musharraf.

Restating that he had already accepted the invitation to visit 
Pakistan, Mr Vajpayee said: "I will surely meet President Musharraf 
but the date and venue for the meeting are yet to be decided."

In his only on-camera comment on the issue since last week's 
parliament statement on the Agra summit, the prime minister said 
there was no pressure from the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya 
Swayamsewak Sangh against his proposed meeting with President 
Musharraf.

<a name="mush">Musharraf not serious about peace: Vajpayee</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring desk

NEW DELHI, July 28: Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said that 
President Pervez Musharraf came to the Agra summit "as a military 
man with a specific self-serving goal and was not serious about 
restoring peace" between the two nations.

Mr Vajpayee said that "from day one (of the summit), it appeared 
that the talks were going to break down because of Musharraf's 
attitude. He (Musharraf) even refused to acknowledge the Simla 
Agreement of 1972 and the Lahore Declaration of 1999." "By 
afternoon on the second day, Musharraf became quite desperate as he 
realized he would have to return to Islamabad empty handed," Mr 
Vajpayee said.

The prime minister remarked that Gen Musharraf often appeared 
"ignorant" about Indian politics and history. India, he felt, had 
not lost anything from the Agra summit. "The world has seen India's 
resolve to achieve peace in the sub- continent," he pointed out.

Mr Vajpayee's 30-minute speech was laced with humour and also 
contained a strong message that his government was not going to 
compromise on Jammu and Kashmir. "We have given a message to the 
world that India can never compromise on Jammu and Kashmir. It is 
an integral part of our country."

The national executive also passed a resolution on the Agra summit, 
saying that "it must be clearly understood that no meaningful 
dialogue with Pakistan can be conducted as long as the Jihadi 
mentality dominates the Pakistani establishment."

The resolution further warned that "if Pakistan continues to adopt 
a negative posture, the government of India should draw appropriate 
conclusions and plan for the future accordingly." During the 
discussion on the resolution, some members opposed the opening of 
additional points on the India-Pakistan border for issuing visas, 
which is one of the confidence building measures announced by India 
on the eve of the Agra summit. Said a delegate from Rajasthan: "If 
we allow easy passage for Pakistanis in India, very soon Jodhpur 
and other cities in Rajasthan will turn into another Kashmir."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, July 28: Benazir Bhutto has said that the military 
regime is diverting domestic and international opinion by 
exploiting foreign policy issues while the domestic and regional 
situation becomes more critical. She was talking to the second 
Pakistani British elected to the House of Commons, Khalid Mahmud, 
says a press release. 

The PPP leader briefed Mr Mahmud on the political situation in 
Pakistan. She praised Britain's support for the restoration of 
democracy and highlighted cases of human rights abuses in the 
country. She said that her family and forty per cent of the PPP 
Central Executive Committee members were facing persecution at the 
hands of the generals because of their political beliefs. The 
former prime minister said the atmosphere of persecution in the 
country had affected the ordinary Pakistanis as law and order had 
worsened and the economy had continued to decline.

<a name="40in">40 Indian army men face inquiry</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 3: At least 40 Indian army men face Courts of 
Inquiry on charges ranging from failure of command and control to 
cowardice and desertion, during the Kargil operations. A report in 
the Indian magazine Outlook, under the caption "War and witch-
hunts", says that the army men include majors, junior commissioned 
officers and jawans.

The magazine says: "None of the generals, whose duty it was to 
conduct the war is facing any official inquiry for their flawed 
leadership. Instead, two of them have been decorated and awarded 
with plum posting. "This has triggered enormous resentment among 
the junior officers and men. This is the first time in the history 
of the Indian army that such a large number of inquiries have been 
initiated against officers and men. "But when allegations in the 
press and parliament surfaced that the top brass had mismanaged the 
Kargil operations, the generals concerned were quick to launch a 
cover-up operation.

"The ploy they used was to selectively target battalions entrusted 
with the most difficult of tasks- charging up the mountain to evict 
the 'freedom fighters' perched atop, a strategy built around high 
human cost. "Other top targets are officers and men of those 
battalions charged with failing to detect the takeover while the 
top brass ignored the early warnings of heightened enemy buildups. 
The blame has been placed solely on those deployed in Kargil. Even 
the Subrahmanyam Committee talks of overall intelligence failure".-

<a name="west">West mulls proposals for resolving Kashmir issue </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, July 30: Pakistan and India will have to find out an 
amicable resolution of Kashmir dispute to ensure peace and 
stability in the region. Diplomatic sources told Dawn that the 
United States and the European Union (EU) were closely monitoring 
the latest developments in the region to resolve the half-a-
century-old Kashmir dispute.

They said that time had come when the Kashmir issue could not be 
allowed to linger on for an indefinite time and that its resolution 
was now one of the top priorities of USA and the West. The visit of 
US Assistance Secretary of State Christina Rocca is being termed 
very significant by the sources.

"We hope she would also have fruitful talks with Pakistan officials 
as was done last week in New Delhi for settling the Kashmir issue," 
said a senior western diplomat. He said that various proposals were 
being discussed to settle the Kashmir issue.

"One of the proposals is that India and Pakistan should jointly 
manage both sides of Kashmir," he said, adding that France and 
Spain had overcome their territorial dispute over Andorre region 
over 500 years ago by agreeing to run its affairs jointly. To a 
question he said that the proposal might not be accepted by both 
India and Pakistan but hastened to add, "If they can manage Wahga 
border jointly why cannot they do the same in Kashmir?"

The sources lauded President Gen Pervez Musharraf's efforts to 
resolve the Kashmir dispute and said that centrality of the Kashmir 
problem was now being recognized by everyone including India.

They expressed the hope that with the US Assistance Secretary of 
State visiting both the countries, Indian Prime Minister Atal 
Behari Vajpayee's forthcoming visit to Islamabad would be 
significant to address the Kashmir issue in its true prospective.

"A European Union (EU) delegation visits Indian-controlled Kashmir 
once a year and some time twice a year and it is very much 
concerned about human rights violations there and as such the issue 
is not going unnoticed as many people believe in Pakistan," the 
sources said.

They said that both Pakistan and India had unofficially been 
recognized as nuclear powers and if they went to war it would be 
disastrous for both the countries. "The US and West have come to 
the conclusion that India and Pakistan cannot have any territorial 
gain in case of war because both have formidable nuclear arsenals," 
they added. Therefore, they said, the two countries would have to 
hold talks to resolve their dispute peacefully.

About the situation in Pakistan, they said President Musharraf had 
successfully improved the economy for which international donors 
would offer all possible assistance. However, they said, the 
president would get the legitimacy when he held general elections 
and help return the country on the path to democracy as he had 
himself promised on a number of occasions.

The sources said that Pakistan's Afghanistan policy needed to be 
reviewed as the West was afraid of fundamentalism and spread of 
drugs and illegal weapons in the region as well as their exports to 
western countries. They said that Islamabad enjoyed a certain 
degree of influence on Taliban which should be used to get the 
desired results.

<a name="lift">Lifting of sanctions linked to democracy: Rocca</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Syed Talat Hussain

ISLAMABAD, Aug 2: The US Assistant Secretary of State for South 
Asian Affairs, Christina B. Rocca, said that the United States 
wanted to find a way to re-engage with Pakistan.

Talking to reporters at the end of a three-day visit to Pakistan, 
Ms Rocca said part of the purpose of her visit to Pakistan was to 
see where these relations could be fixed, which she said, had not 
been the best in the last couple of years. "We want to find a way 
to re-engage with Pakistan because Pakistan is important to us. We 
have got a lot of interests in common and we need to find a way to 
build on that," she said.

The US official said all the nuclear-related sanctions against 
Pakistan were still being discussed. She said section 508 or 
democracy-related sanctions could only be lifted when democracy was 
fully restored. The US official said both Pakistan and India were 
important to the US and the US relations with them were not a zero-
sum game for either.

<a name="join">Joint screening of Afghan refugees: Accord signed with UNHCR</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ahmed Hassan

ISLAMABAD, Aug 2: The United Nations High Commission for Refugees 
(UNHCR), after showing considerable resistance, has finally reached 
an agreement with Pakistan government on the screening of Afghan 
refugees who have fled to Pakistan to escape drought and war in 
their homeland.

Both the sides signed what the UNHCR representative in Pakistan 
described as a "landmark agreement" which will set in motion a 
screening process for the Afghans who had fled their country in the 
past couple of years and are now living in Pakistan without being 
registered. Earlier, the UNHCR was adamant on screening of fresh 
Afghan arrivals on the grounds that no refugee under the 
conventional law could forcefully be repatriated while Pakistan 
insisted repatriation of such unauthorized Afghans.

The government of Afghanistan, seeing no flexibility in Pakistan's 
stand, had announced to establish tent villages inside the country 
for those repatriated from Pakistan and Iran. The UNCHR 
representative in Pakistan Hasim Utkan said: "It was a major 
breakthrough and a significant step forward which will ensure 
proper protection to all those Afghans who deserve it." The UN 
Resident Coordinator Onder Yucer assured full support to the 
agreement and hoped that it will facilitate assistance to the 
refugees.

Under the agreement, 30 joint UNHCR/Pakistan teams will begin 
screening of the Afghans in Jalozai and Nasir Bagh in the NWFP and 
within three weeks the teams will be increased to 55 who will 
eventually also cover new Shamshato refugee amp. 

Under the programme, an information campaign targeting the 
residents of Jalozai and Nasir Bagh will start immediately, to be 
followed by a data-gathering exercise for 20 days. During this 
phase, the Afghans will be asked for general family information. 
They will also be asked if they wished to return home. Those who 
will opt for going home would receive a voluntary repatriation 
grant.

The Afghans opting for joining in the joint screening exercise will 
be interviewed to determine their status and those found to be 
needing protection will be allowed to stay in Pakistan and will be 
relocated to settlements specified by the authorities and will 
receive assistance from the UNHCR. The Afghans whose cases will be 
rejected would have the right to appeal. However, once a final 
decision is taken, they would have to return home.

The UNHCR has urged the authorities to treat those screened out in 
accordance with international human rights standards and allow for 
the phased return of vulnerable ones. At present Pakistan hosts 
some two million Afghan refugees of whom 1.2 million lived in 203 
villages grouped into 127 key refugee clusters - 105 in NWFP, 21 in 
Balochistan and one in Punjab.

<a name="unop">UN opposes forced repatriation of DPs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Abdul Sami Paracha

KOHAT, July 29: The UNHCR and the ministry of state and frontier 
regions (SAFRON) have once again failed to reach an agreement on 
the criteria for screening two million "registered" Afghan refugees 
residing in different cities of the country.

Dawn has learnt that UNHCR officials are adamant that, under the 
international law, the refugees cannot be forced to go back to 
their country unless normality returns there. They say that 
Pakistan officials' claim that these Afghans have, in fact, crossed 
the border to escape harsh economic conditions prevalent in their 
country, is not true because there are reports of heavy fighting 
going on between the Taliban and the forces of Northern Alliance.

A senior UN official told Dawn on Sunday that" we are certainly not 
against the screening of those Afghan refugees who are willing to 
go back to their native towns, where peace has returned, but we are 
against forced repatriation of refugees who have been living here 
for the last 16 years.

" The meaning of the word' refugee' is very clear and those falling 
in this category enjoy certain legal rights ensured by the UN. So, 
we hope that there will be no confusion about it in future talks 
over the screening of refugees."

The official said:" The United Nations is aware of the problems 
faced by the government and the people of Pakistan due to the 
presence of such a large number of refugees and that is why it has 
started phase-wise repatriation from NWFP." He said billions of 
rupees were required for the rehabilitation of refugees in their 
country, whereas the response from the world powers, which were 
party to the Afghan war and responsible for bringing misery to that 
country, was very poor. 

The UN could not go the whole hog without monetary support from 
these countries, he added.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 3: The acting president of Pakistan Muslim League,

of local bodies election by the military rulers had caused 
irreparable damage to the army's image among the masses.

"We still regard the army as a very sacred institution," Mr Hashmi 
said at a press conference, held at the party secretariat. He said 
the rulers were out to destroy the army's image. "The biggest crime 
of the rulers is that they have damaged the military's image beyond 
repair."

He said military intervention in politics was not something new, 
but it used to be on a very high level. This time even the officers 
of major rank intervened and influenced candidates, he claimed. He 
said the overwhelming success of candidates backed by political 
parties was a major setback to the government's designs. "The new 
system has, in fact, broken down even before take off."

He said the government had miserably failed to eliminate two major 
opposition parties from the political horizon of the country. 
Commenting on the election result, he said the PML had boycotted 
the election and had not fielded any candidate. However, he added, 
it had allowed its workers and leaders to make adjustments at the 
local level.

<a name="chan">Changes in NAB law: draft sent for approval</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, July 30: National Accountability Bureau has suggested 
changes in the NAB ordinance and submitted draft amendments to the 
federal government to bring it in conformity with the Supreme Court 
judgment.

Speaking at a press briefing, NAB chairman Lt-Gen Khalid Maqbool 
said: "NAB has sent a package of amendments in the NAB ordinance to 
the federal government for approval. The package has been so 
drafted that it will fulfil the directives of the Supreme Court 
judgment." In reply to a question, Lt-Gen Maqbool said these 
amendments would make the whole process more efficient, help in 
combating economic crimes and facilitate the procurement of 
corruption evidence from abroad.

The chairman declined to go into the specifics of the proposed 
amendments but denied reports that one of the proposed amendments 
had been prepared to target Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari in 
the SGS case. "The proposed amendment has not specifically been 
drafted with reference to the SGS case," he explained, adding, "we 
have suggested things that would enable us to put before the court 
evidence received from abroad."

The General said the accountability process had received 
international recognition and many countries were now cooperating 
with Pakistan in extradition and provision of documentary evidence 
against the corrupt. He said the British attorney-general had 
provided to the Pakistan government volumes of evidence comprising 
22,000 papers against Ms Bhutto and her spouse. The evidence, he 
said, contained documents about the famous Rock Wood Estate. "Now 
we are taking our investigations beyond our borders."

He revealed that NAB was investigating big corruption cases in the 
PTCL, Pakistan Steel Mills, Karachi Development Authority, Lahore 
Development Authority, ministry of petroleum and allied 
organizations, including the OGDC and Pakistan State Oil. In the 
NWFP, he said, NAB was looking into the Ring Road scam and Ghazi 
Barotha project in which, he added, land had been bought at 
exorbitantly higher prices.

The three financial institutions in which investigations had been 
launched were: Bankers Equity, Indus Bank and the Prudential Bank. 
He said the State Bank was cooperating with NAB investigations.

KARACHI, Aug 1: The deputy convener of the Muttahida Qaumi 
Movement's coordination committee, Aftab Ahmed Shaikh, has said 
that government agencies' personnel were resorting to torture his 
party workers in order to get their loyalty changed.

Speaking at a press conference Mr Aftab deplored the alleged 
barbaric torture to a Muttahida member, Mohammad Naeem, in 
Hyderabad, and stated that due to extreme infliction of pain and 
injury Naeem was compelled to attempt suicide in police custody. He 
also praised Naeem and maintained that his attempt to kill himself 
was just to keep his party loyalty intact.

Muttahida's deputy convener said that the higher authorities were 
kept informed about the arrests of party workers, their 
victimization and torturous actions against them, but no 
encouraging reply was available from them. "In fact there is no 
acceptance of Muhajir people's human rights by the people at the 
helm of affairs and now we are informing the national and 
international human rights organizations about the injustices and 
damages being done to the Muhajirs," he said.

<a name="mini">Ministries to be rightsized</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, July 28: The government has decided to substantially 
reduce the size of the federal structure to be unfolded by 
President Gen Pervez Musharraf on August 14 this year. Official 
sources said that a big downsizing and rightsizing of federal 
ministries and divisions were currently being finalised with a view 
to improving the economy.

"There is no justification for those ministries and divisions which 
are performing equal functions," a ministerial source said. He 
added that President Musharraf had called for closing down those 
ministries and divisions which were performing equal functions and 
hence becoming a great burden on the public purse. He said the 
present 34 divisions were likely to be cut to half by having their 
mergers. In some cases, few of the divisions will be totally 
dissolved.

The World Bank and the IMF have also reportedly called for reducing 
the strength of the federal government specially by removing the 
dead wood and those appointed on political considerations by both 
the PPP and PML governments.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, July 28: Pakistan has called upon the five permanent 
members of the UN Security Council to prevent Israel extremists 
from laying the foundation-stone of the Solomon Temple on July 29, 
2001.

Following is text of the government statement: "The government of 
Pakistan has received the extremely disturbing news that a group of 
extremists in Israel intends to lay the foundation-stone of the 
Solomon Temple, possibly on Sunday, July 29, 2001, threatening to 
destroy the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Holy Al-Quds.

"Such a criminal act violative of the sanctity of one of the 
holiest Islamic places which is heritage also of human 
civilization, would be bound to trigger a strong reaction 
throughout the Muslim world, with grave and incalculable 
consequences for the maintenance of international peace and 
security.

"The government of Pakistan calls upon the UNSC to take immediate 
cognizance of the criminal action planned by Israeli extremists, 
and to urge the Government of Israel to take prompt and effective 
measures to prevent violation of its international obligations 
under resolutions of the UNSC and principles of international law 
governing occupied territories.'' "The government of Pakistan also 
appeals to the Security Council of the United Nations to take 
appropriate action without loss of time in order to protect the 
sanctity of the Al-Aqsa Mosque," the statement concluded.

<a name="unte">UN team to operate from Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Syed Talat Hussain

ISLAMABAD, July 31: Majority of the 15 members of the special team 
to monitor arms embargo enforcement against the Taliban will 
operate from Pakistan, diplomatic sources told Dawn.

The Sanctions Enforcement Support Team, which has been approved by 
the United Nations Security Council, will coordinate with a five-
member New York-based Monitoring Group. This group will work in the 
areas of counter-terrorism, financing of terrorism, money 
laundering, financial transactions and drug trafficking, diplomatic 
sources said. Most members of the Support Team, the field arm of 
the Monitoring Group, will be based in Pakistan, others will be 
sent to Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and China.

Diplomatic sources said the bulk of the operations of this team 
would be based in Pakistan because it had the longest border with 
Afghanistan (2430km) of all the other contagious countries. The 
other reason for basing the team's operations primarily in Pakistan 
is reports that the Taliban continue to get support from groups and 
entities based in Pakistan.

As part of the functions and mandate of the team, it will also 
render assistance and training equipment to modernize services and 
the capabilities of Pakistani agencies involved in effective 
control and monitoring of its border with Afghanistan.

The team members will not go inside Afghanistan, where the Taliban 
have already declared any such monitoring activity by the 
international community as enemy deployment. The members will have 
to rely considerably on the information gathered from all sources, 
including Non-Governmental Organizations and various embassies in 
Islamabad.

Diplomatic sources say that Pakistan has already agreed to hosting 
and fully cooperating with team members and abiding by all other 
obligations under the new UNSC resolution. Government sources, 
however, say that various aspects of the operations of the new 
sanctions monitoring embargo system are not known as yet and will 
be worked out when the mechanism becomes fully operational.

DECISION CRITICIZED: Pakistani officials on Tuesday slammed a UN 
decision to monitor sanctions against Afghanistan's Taliban 
militia, but promised Islamabad's cooperation, Reuters adds.

A foreign ministry official said the Security Council's decision 
was an "intrusion" on Pakistan's sovereignty. "Pakistan wanted the 
United Nations to negotiate on the issue and be soft. Pakistan felt 
such an arrangement would be an intrusion in its sovereign status," 
said the official who refused to be named.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ahmad Hasan Alvi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 3: Former prime minister and chairperson of Pakistan 
People's Party (PPP) Benazir Bhutto said that Pakistan was not 
progressing due to repeated martial laws in the country. According 
to PPP Media Cell, Benazir Bhutto was speaking at a news conference 
in Glasgow. 

She said martial law was giving bad name to the country. Recalling 
history, she said for five decades generals seized power and blamed 
the politicians for poor governance. Each time they became "dry 
cleaning machines to dry clean the politicians". She said the 
country had seen four military dictators and the generals should 
analyze the fact whether politicians were really responsible or 
something was wrong with "dry cleaning machines".

She said in fact politicians were being systematically undermined 
by some generals, who had led to humiliation through Tashkent 
Declaration, loss of East Pakistan, Siachen glacier, the 
humiliating withdrawal from Kargil and the collapse of economy. Ms 
Bhutto expressed her concern over failure of the military regime to 
enforce United Nations' decision, which led to the physical 
presence of UN monitors in Pakistan.

<a name="pilg">Pilgrims to pay more for Haj next year: policy announced</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 1: The federal cabinet approved the Haj policy for 
the year 2001-2002, increasing the total number of Haj pilgrims to 
120,000.

Announcing the salient features of new Haj policy, the Federal 
Minister for Religious Affairs, Dr Mehmud Ahmed Ghazi, told a news 
conference that due to sharp rupee devaluation the Haj expenses 
were increased to Rs105,500 for those going from Karachi and 
Rs109,000 for those going from four other stations.

He said the banks would start receiving applications for Regular 
and Sponsorship schemes from August 8. Dr Ghazi said 45,000 people 
would perform Haj under Regular Scheme and 75,000 under Sponsorship 
scheme who would be allowed to opt for government-arranged 
accommodation or privately-hired buildings.

He said an open Haj scheme had been launched which was a voluntary 
facility, designed to oblige those not interested in performing Haj 
under government arrangement. While explaining the justification 
for allowing PIA to raise fare by 15 per cent, the minister said 
last year dollar was available at Rs53, but now it was available at 
Rs66. Moreover, the PIA has increased its fares on all routes, he 
said.

He said the new Haj policy had been prepared after a series of 
consultative meetings between stakeholders, Haj Directorate 
officials, Saudi officials and Ulema in order to remove all the 
complaints received in the past due to poor arrangements.

The number of exit points for Haj pilgrims has been reduced to five 
- Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Quetta and Peshawar - while Sukkur, 
Multan and Faisalabad have been dropped for the time being due to 
insufficient facilities at smaller airports, the minister said.

The minister said personal exchange quota would likely to be $1200 
per pilgrim while the duration of stay in Saudi Arabia would remain 
40 days. Dr Ghazi said any individual or group who would like to 
make own arrangements for ticket and accommodation would be able to 
do so without needing the NOC from the ministry. He said those 
desirous of making their own accommodation arrangement would have 
to provide proof of accommodation before leaving for Saudi Arabia. 
Such applicants would have to intimate the Religious Affairs 
Ministry within a stipulated period enabling it to make proper 
arrangements.

The Haj pilgrims who fail to furnish documentary proof of their 
independent accommodation arrangements will be able to get the 
government arranged facility in case their request is received on 
time. He said efforts would be made to acquire accommodation in 
Makkah Mukarramah and Madinah Munawarah at the maximum limit of 
Rs1800 and minimum Rs1000 to ensure maximum comforts for pilgrims.

The facilities for Haj pilgrims, the minister disclosed, have been 
divided into three categories A, B and C. He said the PIA would be 
asked to prepare its schedule in such a way as would allow return 
of every Haji within 40 days.

The government has also decided to maintain the ban on all quotas 
except for labour organizations, benevolent fund and defence 
services quotas. The schedule of Haj applications under Regular and 
Sponsorship schemes and Open Hajj scheme will be as follows: 
Applications under Regular scheme would be received from Aug 8 to 
Aug 28. Application under Sponsorship scheme would be received from 
Aug 8 to Sept 8.

Applications with late fee of Rs5000 under Sponsorship scheme would 
be received from Sept 8 to Sept 21. Applications for open Haj 
scheme would be received from Nov 1 to Nov 14. Applications with 
late double fee of Rs10,000 under Sponsorship scheme would be 
received from Nov 15 to Nov 30.

<a name="iran">Iran turns down Pakistan request</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, July 28: Iran has politely refused to entertain 
Pakistan's request for giving its vehicles transit facilities to 
approach Central Asian Republics. Official sources told Dawn that 
Pakistan, at the Joint Ministerial Commission meeting held in 
Tehran last week, had sought that its vehicles carrying goods be 
allowed passage to Central Asian Republics through Iran.

The Iranian government responded that Pakistani vehicles would be 
permitted to travel deep into Iranian territory up to the CARs 
borders. However, they would not be allowed to cross CAS border as 
from that point goods would have to be transported in Iranian 
vehicles. Sources said that Pakistan had made the request for the 
transit facility last year as it wanted to take its fruits to CARs 
markets. The request was accepted by Iran but at a time when the 
season of citrus was already over.

The Iranian authorities conveyed to Pakistan in the second 
fortnight of February that its request had been accepted and that 
Pakistan would be free to transport its citrus fruit to CARs till 
the end of March. At the last week meeting, Pakistan had also 
raised the issue of Iran's "going slow" on the development of the 
railway track from Zahidan to Kirman, which would allow Pakistan to 
establish railway links not only with Economic Cooperation 
Organization states but also with Europe through Turkey.

Under the ECO decision in 1990, all the member states had to 
establish railway links. Iran, however, did not develop railway 
links from Zahidan to Kirman. Iranian authorities assured Pakistan 
delegation that the railway track would be ready by 2004. However, 
they asked Pakistan to upgrade its railway track from Quetta to 
Taftan, saying as it was not up to the mark.

Pakistan had asked the Iranian authorities to make efforts for 
narrowing the trade imbalance. Last year, Pakistan imported goods 
worth $130 million from Iran. In contrast, Iran imported from 
Pakistan goods worth $11 million only. 

Pakistan had also raised the issue of levy of taxes from its 
truckers and bus drivers, asking the Iranian government to 
eliminate the taxes.

The Iranian authorities assured that except $27 per truck, no other 
tax would be charged on vehicles coming from Pakistan. Iran is 
charging $27 from each truck up to Zahidan as fuel surcharge on the 
ground that fuel in Iran is available at prices lower than what 
they are in Pakistan.

<a name="tarb">Tarbela Dam's storage capacity decreases </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Intikhab Amir

TARBELA, Aug 1: Inability on the part of the Tarbela Dam's 
management to maintain the minimum operating level at 1,369 feet 
due to greater irrigation requirements during the Kharif season has 
decreased the life storage capacity of the dam, official sources 
told Dawn.

The sources said the pressing irrigation requirements down the 
stream necessitated to bring down the level to 1,369 feet twice in 
April last, which was against the recommendation of consultants.

The consultant firms, TAMS and HR Wailling Fort, in one of their 
three main recommendations under a study back in 1998, had 
suggested that minimum operating level (MOL) of the Tarbela 
reservoir should be raised by four feet every year to cope with the 
silt problem. It was recommended that MOL should be maintained at 
four feet higher than the preceding year. Besides, it was 
recommended that the MOL raised so (by four feet every year) should 
not be maintained beyond 15 days to avoid accumulation of silt in 
the reservoir.

"They had recommended that maintaining the reservoir level at the 
MOL for more than 15 days would lend a negative impact to the water 
storage capacity of the reservoir," said a senior official. The 
sources said the recommendation could not be implemented due to 
increasing irrigation requirements in Punjab and Sindh. Officers of 
the water and power department of the Tarbela Dam project said the 
country needed a new mega water storage project to cope with its 
future irrigation requirements. 

The under water delta of silt, which was at a distance of nine 
kilometers from the dam, moved three kilometers close to it last 
year after the reservoir level had to be brought down to 1,321 
feet. Official sources said by lowering the level to 1,321 feet 
last year the reservoir lost storage capacity equivalent to 10 
years.

Sources said the reservoir had lost 50 per cent of its dead storage 
capacity. After the reservoir lost three million acre feet (maf) of 
its total 11 maf water storage capacity, the minimum operating 
level was fixed at 1,369 feet in 1998, which was ignored on several 
occasions to meet the requirements of irrigation water in Punjab 
and Sindh.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, July 31: A spokesman for the Pakistan Muslim League(N) 
said that assassination of six persons, including government 
officials, politicians and a religious leader, in broad daylight 
within five days testified to the failure of the military 
government in protecting life of law-abiding citizens.

Taking exception to the unchecked killing spree of the terrorists, 
the PML spokesman said that on July 26, the managing director of 
Pakistan State Oil (PSO) Shaukat Mirza and his driver were 
assassinated in Karachi. Two days later, PML leaders Muhammad 
Siddique Khan Kanju and Aslam Joya were killed in Lodhran in a 
packed bazaar. He said that on July 30, the Ministry of Defence 
director, Zafar Hussain Zaidi, was murdered in Karachi, followed by 
the killing of a religious leader Syed Rizwan Shah in Lahore, the 
same day.

These recent incidents showed that the government was not capable 
of providing protection even to important government functionaries, 
what to talk about common citizens. The spokesman said the never-
ending incidents of terrorism, dacoities and abduction for ransom 
had tarnished the image of the country in the eyes of international 
community, strengthening their impression about Pakistan as a 
country without laws.

hollowness of the government's campaign to recover illegal weapons. 
She said that making the country weapons-free required political 
will and courage and could not be eliminated by hollow rhetoric. 
She asked the government to arrest all the terrorists involved in 
such heinous acts and give them exemplary punishment.

Rs7.1 million in a corruption case, by the Judge, accountability 
court III, Sakhi Hussain Bokhari.

The co-accused, Adnan A. Khwaja, was awarded two years' RI and 
fined Rs200,000 and Nadeem Imtiaz,son of the ex-IB chief, was 
sentenced to three years' RI under, section 31(a) of the NAB 
Ordinance, in absentia. The court directed Brig Imtiaz, who served 
as the director-general, IB, during the Nawaz Sharif government, to 
pay the fine within one month. He court also ordered forfeiture of 
all the properties, acquired in his name or in the name of his 
dependants, in favour of the government.

The Islamabad properties, which will be confiscated, include house 
No 286 F-10/4, unit No 2 and 9, at I-S Plaza, F-10 Markaz; house No 
7, Street No 20, F-7/2; and house No 6 on the 9th avenue, F-8/2.

The court granted the benefit of section 382(b) to both the 
convicts, which means that the conviction will be counted from May 
26, 2000, the day on which the former IB chief was arrested. Brig 
Imtiaz was charged with amassing assets, both movable and 
immovable, which were disproportionate to his known source of 
income. The properties were in his own name and in the names of his 
wife, son ( Nadeem) and his front men, including Adnan and 
approvers Abdul Ghaffar Chauhan and Shamshad Ali.

The accused had also acquired properties as Benamidars and 
possessed foreign exchange bearer certificates, worth Rs20 million, 
which had been encashed by him, according to the case. Later, Brig 
Imtiaz told reporters that he would challenge his conviction in the 
high court, and added that, in his view, the punishment awarded by 
the court was quite stringent.

He claimed that his conscience was clear as he had never committed 
any crime or compromised on principles. "During my 17 years of 
professional career, I served this country without fear or favour 
and countered both internal and external threats against the 
country and never allowed my personal interest or family matters to 
interfere in my duties," he observed. He said he had no remorse for 
the troubles he was in or hardships his family was facing, because 
he had always considered his job a sacred duty.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 2: The Al-Qaida organization, claimed to be 
affiliated to Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden, has warned America 
against launching an attack on Osama, "lest the Mujahideen will 
retaliate" by targeting its citizens the world over.

In a fax statement signed by the organization's self-proclaimed 
chief military commander, Naseer Ahmed, the Al-Qaida asked Pakistan 
not to cooperate with the US on the Osama issue as it was a 
conflict between Afghanistan and America.

It said the "get Osama mission" being undertaken by the American 
assistant secretary of state would never be fulfilled since the 
"Mujahideen were fully alert and were capable of replying the enemy 
in the same coin." It warned the US and India that the American 
embassies in India and Pakistan could be targeted by the Mujahideen 
any moment.

The statement said: "We have achieved balance of power by offering 
sacrifices, the Muslim Ummah should adopt a strong stand on Kashmir 
in order to secure its freedom, which will only be achieved through 
jihad and not negotiations."

"No Muslim could evade the duty of jihad and wherever the 
Mujahideen were busy in armed struggle they were performing their 
bounded duty," it said, and added, "all the rulers of Muslim states 
were working on the Zionist and American agenda." It said the 
criminal intention of Jews to construct "Solomon Temple" was a 
conspiracy and a challenge for the Muslims that could be thwarted 
only through complete unity among Muslims.

<a name="wbif">WB, IFC assessment under way: Private sector issues</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawaid Bokhari

KARACHI, Aug 2: the World Bank and its affiliate International 
Finance Corporation (IFC) are jointly carrying out an assessment of 
private sector issues and regulatory constraints to private sector 
development.

A joint World Bank-IFC team is also currently engaged in an in- 
depth review of five main industries - sugar, cement, textiles, 
fertilizer and steel - which according to bank are operating under 
a very distorted policy environment.

The World Bank has also initiated a firm-level survey to identify 
the constraints on the growth and performance of small and medium 
sized enterprises. These studies are part of the World Bank's 
Pakistan's assistance strategy (PAS). Simultaneously, the 
government has announced that it intends to set up a deregulation 
committee headed by an eminent personality from the private sector 
to identify problem areas and make recommendations for 
liberalization.

Helped by analyses carried out by the bank, the PAS progress report 
says that the government intends to deregulate the large protected 
industrial sector, including power, oil, gas and 
telecommunications. For building an environment for private 
investment and sustainable growth, World Bank's key prescriptions 
are trade liberalization, deregulation and privatization including 
banks, power, oil and gas and transport sectors.

The PAS report says that IFC's ability to do business in Pakistan 
has been constrained. The 1998 balance of payments crisis, large 
external indebtedness, political instability, disputes with 
investors (especially in the power sector) and loss of investors' 
confidence have increased the perceived risk and discouraged new 
investment. Moreover, distortionary policies, for example for 
cement, automotive oil and gas further deter private investment and 
handicap IFC's support.

The IFC delegation led by Ellen Iskenderian told finance minister 
Shaukat Aziz late last month that several projects were under 
consideration of the corporation. The IFC is considering further 
investment in the financial sector, the gas sector etc.

The World Bank report says that the pace of future IFC investment 
will depend on continued progress towards economic and political 
stability, a more transparent, non-discriminatory and market-based 
policy environment and privatization of banks and other public 
enterprises. Priorities for future IFC investment are to develop 
the financial sector to improve access to finance small and medium-
sized industries and micro-enterprises, improve efficiency of 
commercial banking, investment in gas production and 
transportation, support for private investment in infrastructure 
and investment in industries with growth prospects which can be 
competitive without dependence on the government protection and 
subsidies.

The IFC's investments in financial sector are, however, linked to 
removal of uncertainty regarding the implication and implementation 
of Sharia code on all financial transactions. So far, IFC has 
focused on restructuring its own portfolio and helping existing 
clients restructure and strengthen their companies's balance-sheet. 
This has led to cancellation of $260m in commitments to 23 
companies. As a result, Pakistan now ranks as IFC's eighth largest 
exposure, down from sixth in December 1998.

IFC's disbursed own account portfolio is currently $447m in 45 
companies, of which 38pc is in five IPP projects, all of them 
operational. The B Loan portfolio is currently $254m in 13 
companies, with a strong concentration (57 per cent) in power. Of 
the 45 portfolio companies, nine are not current, $64m are overdue 
and in non-accrual, while the reserves for loan losses are $80m.

<a name="imfm">IMF mission to open talks on PRGF: $596m SBA to end in Sept</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Aug 2: The IMF standby agreement or 10-month standby 
credit programe currently in operation in Pakistan would end in 
September, and any extension in SBA or its conversion into a long 
term program seems out of question.

Sources close to ministry of finance said that the IMF review 
mission due in Islamabad in mid-August would evaluate Pakistan's 
economic performance in fiscal 2000-01 besides holding talks on 
poverty reduction and growth facility.

They said there are no indications about Pakistan seeking an 
extension in SBA or its conversion into PRGF adding the IMF is less 
likely to weigh such prospects. Since Pakistan has met most of key 
performance criteria set for the last quarter of fiscal 2000-01 the 
mission should not have difficulty in recommending the release of 
fourth tranche out of the $596 million standby credit. 

Pakistan has so far received three tranches worth $457 million and 
the release of the fourth one is linked to its meeting the 
performance criteria set for April-June 2001. The previous three 
tranches were also released only after Pakistan had met quarterly 
performance criteria.

The sources said the five-member IMF mission would split into two 
groups: one would review the economic performance of Pakistan in 
line with the performance criteria attached to SBA, and the other 
would hold negotiations on PRGF. But they could not say how early 
the fourth tranche would come in.

It will depend on how quickly the mission wraps up its report and 
how early the IMF board of directors takes up the issue. The third 
tranche was released quite late-in mid-July-although the IMF 
mission had visited Pakistan as early as in May to assess if it has 
met the performance criteria set for January-March 2001.

The sources said since the 10-month SBA approved on November 30, 
2000 is going to expire in September there is naturally no 
performance criteria for Pakistan in July-September quarter. But 
they made it clear that indicative targets already set for this 
quarter would remain in place. If Pakistan meets the same it would 
help Islamabad improve its image and pave the way for PRGF.

The sources said the talks due in mid-August between Pakistan and 
the IMF review mission would be the start of a series of 
negotiations to be held in future at different levels. They also 
made it clear that the time-frame and the size of PRGF would be 
determined only after the IMF is satisfied that Pakistan can remain 
on track, a prescribed program stretched at least over three years. 
They further said that even before securing PRGF Pakistan would 
have to show its willingness to follow the IMF lead by taking 
certain specific actions.

These actions might include further liberalization of foreign 
exchange regime (read convertibility of the rupee on capital 
account); further documentation of the economy and withdrawal of 
the remaining subsidies and a whole bunch of measures to ensure 
good governance at all tiers of government and state-run bodies.

Pakistan is pinning high hopes on PRGF for bailing out the debt-
laden country and its economic managers have been saying that PRGF 
would be of the size of $2.5-$3 billion. They say that after being 
on track, a three-year PRGF the economy would be stabilized and 
would start to grow at a desired pace. But lately several leading 
economists have questioned the efficacy of the IMF prescriptions 
tagged with $596 million SBA that, according to them, have failed.

<a name="wbof">WB official warns against risks in banks sell-off</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawaid Bokhari

KARACHI, July 31: A World Bank official has cautioned authorities 
against the risks in process of privatization of state-run banks. 
In a presentation made before senior bankers on 'finance for 
growth' Patrick Honohan, lead economist, Development Research 
Group, Development Economies, said it should be ensured that the 
buyers put their own money "and it does not turn out to be a case 
of banks buying banks."

He also recalled that Mexico's experience showed that the funds of 
the privatized banks were used by interest groups acquiring state-
run banks "to channel resources to their (purchasers) own firms." 
Such a privatization is dangerous, he concluded.

Under the prudential regulations, the State Bank allows a bank to 
invest 30 per cent of the paid-up capital of a company or 
enterprise. Normally, in the first phase, about 26 per cent of the 
government stakes in any bank is divested. Patrick Honhan, however, 
favoured privatization of state-run banks as politicians influence 
bank decisions and affect their efficiency. 

First on the privatization agenda is United Bank, which is expected 
to be followed by Habib Bank. The Expressions of Interest received 
for the UBL include four banks - two Omanese and two Pakistani 
banks. The domestic banks are Muslim Commercial Bank and Union 
Bank. Privatization of MCB has been a success.

Market reports indicate that controlling group of MCB, led by Mian 
Mansha has acquired 38 per cent of the outstanding equity of the 
largest insurance company, Adamjee Insurance. Analysts at Merrill 
Lynch say that "we understand that the Mansha Group has given 
assurances to Adamjee's existing management regarding non-
interference; we believe that it is only a matter of time before 
the dynamic Mian Mansha begins to manifest his influence on the 
company." In that eventuality, these financial analysts see a scope 
for significantly broadening the product range of MCB via cross 
selling through Adamjee's policyholder base and vice-versa.

 The Union Bank headed by former HBL and Citibank country chief 
Shaukat Tareen recently acquired Bank of America branches. The bank 
has been looking for opportunities to expand. In the past, it had 
also indicated interest in privatization of Allied Bank. The 
authors of the World Bank Policy Research Report "Finance for 
Growth" concludes that privatization design is of second order 
importance compared with the need to create a competitive-oriented 
banking system that will allocate credit in line with commercial, 
rather than political practices.

<a name="32ml">$32m loan accord signed with Japan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, July 30: Japan's state agency for economic aid said that 
it would loan Pakistan up to 4.032 billion Yen (about $32 million) 
for the construction of Kohat Tunnel Phase-II. Agreement to this 
effect was inked in Tokyo by the governor of Japan Bank for 
International Cooperation, Kyosuke Shinozawa, and Ambassador of 
Pakistan to Japan, Touqir Hussain.

The initial Japanese assistance for the same project was provided 
in 1994. The fresh assistance was announced last year during the 
visit of the then Japanese prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, to 
Pakistan. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Shinozawa appreciated the 
economic reforms of the government and expressed the hope that the 
loan would contribute to the economic development of Pakistan.

The ambassador said that Kohat project would contribute to the 
development of the region. He hoped that the signing of the 
agreement would lead to a review of the sanctions by Japan. 

The loan will cover the second phase of the project to build the 
1,885-metre Kohat tunnel on the Indus highway, linking Peshawar and 
Kohat, a bank statement said. The latest loan will carry an annual 
interest rate of 1.8 per cent and be repayable in 30 years with a 
grace period of 10 years.-Agencies

<a name="cbrc">CBR cell to review task force recommendations</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mubarak Zeb Khan

ISLAMABAD, July 28: The government has established a Tax Reforms 
Cell at the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) to review the 
recommendations of the Task Force on Restructuring Tax 
Administration. Sources in the CBR told Dawn that the cell would be 
headed by the newly promoted member CBR M.S Lal formerly Chief, 
Income Tax Coordinator.

The proposed system of re-structuring the income tax, business 
process and organization would be implemented in three phases. The 
first phase, lasting about six months, would be devoted to 
extensive planning and budgeting, organizational restructuring, 
training, and reengineering of processes as preparation for the 
implementation of the proposed reform. In the second phase, 
beginning on January 2002, a pilot program would be run in two 
income tax regions - the proposed regions are the eastern region 
and Corporate Region, Karachi, the sources said.

It is proposed that the reform program is implemented in its 
entirety in the pilot regions, and simultaneously during this 
phase. A number of new systems and procedure are introduced in the 
other income tax regions. In the third stage, beginning on January 
2003, after learning lessons from the pilot, the system will be 
implemented in the other three regions as well, the source said.

To make the income tax machinery an effective one, the task force 
recommended that the fundamental responsibility for declaring 
income and assessing taxes should lie with the taxpayer, there 
should be selective and professionally conducted audit supported by 
survey and research capability and databases which would assist in 
the selection of cases for audit and in the quality of audit.

It was proposed that there should be stiff penalties, for taxpayers 
for willful tax evasion, there should be minimum direct contact 
between tax officials and taxpayers and information technology 
should play a central role in processing tax returns, selection of 
cases for audit and day to day work for tax officials.

There should be separation of functions to enable specialization, a 
critical mass of tax officials and technology specialists should be 
assembled in selected places to ensure effective and efficient 
service to taxpayers, the committee proposed to the government.

The task force recommended that the existing five regions, 
including the corporate region, be constituted as the nuclei of the 
organization, management, and systems of the reformed income tax 
organization. Each would be headed by a regional commissioner, 
responsible for all operational aspects of the administration of 
income tax in the region. It was recommended that under each RCIT 
there would be six divisions headed by CITs. These are management 
information system, operations and audit, legal and prosecution, 
survey and research, customer service, enforcement and collection 
and inspection and internal audit.

Elaborating further, the sources said that the management 
information system division would be responsible for data entry, 
processing, storage, up keep, access and security of all databases. 
This will allow efficient handling of a number of important 
functions in the department, in particular processing of tax 
returns, filing and record keeping, tax audit, and its supervision 
and monitoring of tax collection and policy analysis.

To make the audit less arbitrary and less discriminatory, the task 
force proposed to free all the auditors from all major non-audit 
responsibilities. This is the reason for creating a separate 
operations and audit division. The division, in addition to conduct 
income tax audits, would also be responsible for system audit for 
ensuring compliance to withholding taxes as well as compliance to 
audit of non-taxpayers.

It was proposed that the criteria used for selection of taxpayers 
for audit should be objective as some taxpayers should be selected 
purely randomly and others on the basis of risk profile of 
taxpayers.

The task force recommended that the Legal and Prosecution Division 
should first define precisely the probable offences discovered 
through the audit and prescribe penalties for them, handle appeals 
emanating from the audit process, and handle prosecution of cases 
of concealment and fraud.

It was proposed that the Customer Service Enforcement and 
Collection Division (CSECD) would be responsible for tax collection 
as well as taxpayer assistance and education. However, CSECD will 
also carry out the responsibilities of receipt of requests for 
registration and de-registration and passing them on to the central 
data centre with findings and recommendations, receipt of tax 
returns for transmission to the information management center, 
pursuit of non-filers, recording of appeal effects, receiving 
requests for extension of deadlines for filing of tax returns, and 
deciding on them with given guidelines, receiving applications for 
rectification and passing them to information management center, 
collection, taxpayer education.

The committee recommended that the Inspection and Internal Audit 
Division will carry out the responsibility of internal audit of the 
Operations and Audit Division, audit of tax refunds issued by MIS 
division, and reopening of cases under section 65 and revision 
under section 66 A.

It was proposed that the income tax process will start with 
taxpayers sending their returns to the customer service centers and 
from there these returns would be sent to the MIS division. At the 
MIS division, the return would be checked for arithmetic errors. 
When these errors are found, demand notices will be sent to the 
taxpayers.

The division will also send notices to non-filers. The tax 
enforcement and collection wing of the Customer Service, 
Enforcement and Collection Division will follow up on tax demand 
notices as well as track non-filers.

All tax returns will also be reconciled with withholding taxes at 
the MIS Division. In case refunds are due, refund voucher will be 
issued. Disputes regarding refunds, and requests for exemption 
certificates by the taxpayer will be handled through the 
appropriate wing of the Customer Service, Enforcement and 
Collection Division.

The selection of cases for audit will be handled by MIS division. 
Selected cases for audit will be assigned to CIT audit who will 
assign these audit teams some of which will be constituted around 
business specialization. After the audit is completed, the officer 
in charge of the audit team will issue the assessment order along 
with demand notice. Collection of tax demand will be the 
responsibility of the Customer Service, Enforcement and Collection 
Division. In cases of serious tax evasion, the matter will be 
referred to the legal department for prosecution.

It was also recommended that the taxpayer Assistance Wing of 
Customer Service Division would handle cases of taxpayer queries 
and complaints. The appeal against the decision of the department 
will follow the same process as in the present system with the 
first appeal lying with the Commissioner appeals and thereafter 
with the income tax tribunal, the High Court and the Supreme Court.

<a name="35co">35 cos suspension creates unrest among investors</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Dilawar Hussain

KARACHI, July 31: The decision by the Karachi Stock Exchange to 
'suspend' as many as thirty-five companies effective July 16, has 
created unrest among the small shareholders, who lament that all 
their investment in those companies may have gone down the drain.
But the managing director KSE, Noman Ahmed, justifies the move, 
which he says, was entirely in 'public interest'.

The number of companies suspended- 35- looks phenomenal, compared 
with only eleven companies that were suspended in the last three 
years, combined. KSE MD told Dawn that the 35 companies put under 
suspension in July, were picked up from among the 120 that are 
languishing on the 'defaulters' counter' for violations under 
section 32 (1) of the listing regulations. He cited host of reasons 
for their suspension: "Many of them have not responded to KSE 
notices; some such as Bankers' Equity are under liquidation, while 
many others simply do not exist," said Noman. He agreed that small 
investors who had taken stake in those companies could go to lose 
money- unless they get something on liquidation. And unfortunate as 
that was, it was the new unsuspecting investors that the stock 
exchange wanted to protect.

"If such companies remain listed, new investors not knowing their 
current status could dabble in those stocks and eventually find 
themselves trapped," the KSE MD said. 

The companies suspended by the KSE on July 16 include: 1st Tawakkal 
Modaraba; Hamraz Industries; Kohinoor Looms; Zahur Textile; 
Tawakkal Polyester; Mian Mohammad Sugar; Multipole Industries; Al-
Husainy Industries; Tawakkal Limited; Standard Insurance; Ayaz 
Textile; Mohib Export; National Silk; Data Agro Limited; Muslim 
Ghee; Crown Textile; Marr Fabrics; Sarhad Ghee; Sunflo Cit-Russ; 
Ittefaq Textile; Tawakkal Garments; Sadiqabad Textile; Pearl 
Fabrics; Sunrise Textile; Aswan Tentage; Nilom Nylon; Karachi Pipe 
Mills; Hyderabad Electronics; Adamjee Paper; Adamjee Floorings; 
Calico Cotton; Harnai Woollen; Bela Engineers; Nusrat Textile and 
Bankers' Equity.

</a>-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, July 31: The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of 
the cabinet here on Tuesday was informed by the governor of the 
State Bank that the country's foreign exchange reserves had reached 
$3.2 billion.

The ECC, which was presided over by Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz, 
was told that the $3.2 billion reserves included $1.7 billion that 
was being maintained by the State Bank and $1.5 billion with other 
commercial banks. The committee reviewed the sugar situation and 
noted that sugar supplies, both from local production and imports, 
were in adequate stock. It noted that there was stability in sugar 
prices.

The stocks failed to establish any set price pattern during the 
week. The KSE 100-share index suffered a fresh fall of about 18 
points at 1,242.84 points as compared to 1,260.59 points a week 
earlier. The breach of the jealously-guarded support index level of 
1,250.00 was taken as a bad omen for the market, which could lead 
to further price erosions, most floor brokers feared.

The market capitalization also suffered a fresh setback of Rs4 
billion at Rs314 billion as compared to Rs318 billion last week as 
all the heavily-capitalized shares, notably the Hub-Power, the PSO 
and the PTCL remained under pressure.

"The persistent foreign selling, notably in the PTCL appears to be 
the market's chief worry and its inability to absorb it even at the 
falling prices. Its price has already fallen to two-year low at 
Rs15.10 and may fall further", the stock analyst at the W.E 
Financials said.

The PSO share, did trigger panic selling, pushing it down to as low 
as Rs121.65 in early trading but the late support allowed it to 
finish partially recovered. The KSE 100-share index early was off 
but the mid-week saw it rising sharply on the strength of the 
leading base shares, notably the Hubco followed by the reports that 
its lenders would meet soon to approve 17 per cent interim dividend 
declared by its management.

It touched the week's highest at 1,276 points but ended at the 
lowest for the week at 1,243 points, as all the leading base shares 
suffered fall under the lead of the PTCL.

The stray flutters of the strong speculative activity were 
witnessed on the forward counters, notably in the PSO and the Hub-
Power but there were no signs of identical two-way trading in their 
shares in the ready section.

An interim cash dividend at the rate of 25 per cent by the Clariant 
Pakistan, for instance, was well-received in the market as was 
reflected by a smart increase in its share value.

Some of the leading shares managed to put on good gains under the 
lead of Fazal Textiles, which rose by Rs7.90. Other good gainers 
were led by the Lever Brothers, the Sitara Chemical, the Ferozsons 
Lab, the Cyanamid Pakistan, the Sindh Abadgar's Sugar and Ishaq 
Textiles with few others posting some good gains.

Losers were led by the Security Papers, the Glaxo-Wellcome, the 
Amin Spinning, the Adamjee Insurance, the MCB, the Alico, the Bolan 
Casting and the Aventis Pharma and several others but most of the 
price changes were two-way.

The trading volume fell to 274m shares from the previous half a 
billion shares, bulk of which was shared by the Hub-Power, the 
PTCL, the PSO, followed by the ICI Pakistan, the Engro Chemical, 
Fauji Fertiliser, the CB, Adamjee Insurance, the FFC-Jordan 
Fertiliser, Dewan Salman and some others.

<a name="twow">Two wrongs do not make one right </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

DELHI: Neither side can give the other what it wants. Very wisely, 
the inscrutable prime minister of India, Atal Behari Vajpayee, and 
General Pervez Musharraf have decided not to slam shut the door but 
to meet again. To dissipate rancour of fifty-four years standing 
requires far more time than fifty-four hours.

Pakistan should make no mistake in its perception. The other side 
is light years ahead of it in too many ways. For instance, take the 
lush green Delhi which, once ranked amongst the topmost highly 
polluted cities of the world, is now smoke and smog and diesel-
petrol fume free, thanks to the Supreme Court of India, and the 
Delhi administration which has implemented its order.

Karachi: Back to its on-going strife, sectarian and other murders, 
pollution, traffic snarls, fading diminishing greenery, and the 
headlines of this newspaper's Metropolitan section which told us 
last week - 'Epidemics feared as flies invade Karachi', 'Centers 
refuse dialysis for want of funds' (the government has still to 
denationalize the Kidney Center erroneously nationalized), and 
'Regularization to destroy town planning'.

The governor of Sindh and his cabinet have once more arisen and 
approved the passing of a resolution that will destroy whatever has 
been left intact in the overtly highly illegally overbuilt city of 
Karachi. Many people will recall how the building mafia in 1999 had 
approached Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz and misled him into 
believing that industries and employment would miraculously be 
revived were all the illegal buildings in Karachi to be 
regularized. The then governor, Air Marshal Azim Daudpota, was also 
highly elated with the mafia's fairy story. However, when the true 
position was explained to both Aziz and Daudpota they realized they 
had been duped.

In came Mohammadmian Soomro as Sindh governor, and he and his 
minister of housing and town planning, Dewan Yousuf, were once 
again revved up by the builders into believing that the 
regularization of all illegally constructed buildings was the 
answer to all Karachi's ills, and yet another committee was formed 
to examine the matter.

The Tasneem Siddiqui committee was asked to submit its report to 
the governor, which it has done. On July 24 of this year, Governor 
Soomro and his cabinet approved the passing of the Sindh Building 
Control (Amendment 2001) Ordinance sanctifying a building policy 
for the beleaguered city of Karachi that is supposed to jump-start 
the urban economy and provide a boost to the 'Program for the 
Economic Revival of Karachi' (PERK). Every citizen can now become a 
legal "illegal and prosperous builder."

The proposed liberal ordinance allows one, within the next 12 
months, to build a multi-storeyed commercial building on even a 
public park if one does not: use the structure for any 
environmentally degrading or hazardous activity; cater to the 
services sector to transport (whatever that means); convert parking 
spaces to other use; violate a road-widening cut-line reservation 
or property line; or, erect a seismically unstable structure.

One can, however: cover the entire compulsory open spaces all 
around (meant for the privacy of neighbors, sunlight and 
ventilation, access for emergency fire/ambulance vehicles, running 
of utility services, etc); construct unlimited excess built-up 
area, with unlimited additional floors; convert an amenity park 
plot into a commercial plot; not provide visibility chamfers on 
corner plots; not provide NOCs from the KESC, KWSB, and SSGCL; 
contravene the Civil Aviation Authority's 'flying gap' limitation; 
construct higher than the podium of Mohammad Ali Jinnah's mazar 
(within the prohibited 3/4th mile radius); and commit many other 
violations of the building regulations.

All one has to do is pay Rs. 300 per square foot (sft) of violation 
space as penalty charges. One can then sell the 'regularized' 
commercial space at a profit of over Rs. 1,300 per sft for offices 
and Rs. 19,000 per sft for shops.

The Tasneem Siddiqui committee report specifically states that 
land-use violations would not be regularized, but the cabinet-
approved ordinance allows the condonation of exactly such 
violations. It seems of no consequence that this conversion cannot 
be done under the SBCO ordinance as it contravenes multiple town-
planning laws and plot-lease covenants.

On October 5, 1999, the KDA governing body wisely cautioned the 
public through a KBCA notice published in newspapers of record that 
numerous unauthorized structures had been constructed in Karachi 
under the cover of court orders, and that the law did not permit 
the 'regularization' of such blatantly illegal and dangerous 
buildings. The KDA/KBCA went on to correctly clarify that 
"condonation is only possible when the deviations from the approved 
plans are still within the building regulations."

In an about-face, on May 3,2001, without debate the KDA governing 
body pushed through the Tasneem Siddiqui committee report 
recommending virtually blanket 'regularization'. Two public 
representatives, ex-Senator Syed Mazher Ali (himself a builder and 
founder-member of ABAD) and I, both present at the meeting, 
dissented strongly. I insisted that my detailed objection be 
attached to the report, along with my following note of caution: 
"These documents, without any specific recommendation of the GB, 
should confuse the governor, as they should any other reasonable 
man. It is not fair to throw the ball in the governor's court and 
make him take a wrong decision for which he will be held 
responsible, and for which he would have to face an inquiry which 
any subsequent government will hold. He would have to suffer the 
consequences, presuming that he would then be in Pakistan, not 
having absconded."

This 'regularization' policy has the whole-hearted support of 
businessman/builder-turned-vice-chairman of the Economic 
Development Council of Sindh, Shahid Firoz, who is committed to 
making Karachi "the most livable city in South Asia by 2007." 
Shahid spouts a smooth line of patter while explaining the details 
of his grandiose plans. He has been motivated by the builders of 
'Fortune Towers', 'Saima Trade Towers', 'Business Avenue', 'Clifton 
Shopping Galleria', and numerous other illegal structures on Sharea 
Faisal who explain how advantageous it would be to the government 
of Sindh if illegalities were to be condoned -- at a price.

All, however, is not lost. The High Court of Sindh is still acting 
as the guardian of the 'right to life' of the citizens and is 
delivering on issues brought to its judicial notice. Two cases in 
the High Court involving the built environment of Karachi have 
fared well over the past fortnight.

In the 'Karachi Playhouse' petition challenging a mammoth 
commercial structure being constructed on an amenity/public 
building plot reserved for a theatre at Teen Talwar, the division 
bench recognized the prima facie validity of the citizens' petition 
that Clifton Cantonment Board's building regulations could not 
override the original zoning/town planning of the KDA Kahkashan 
Scheme.

In the 'Saima Trade Towers' case, dealing with a grossly over-built 
structure on I. I. Chundrigar Road, the division bench placed a 
liberal interpretation on the concept of locus standi while 
recognizing that "certain individuals or groups have over the years 
proved their bona fides for championing the cause connected with 
certain aspects of the city." The court rejected the stand of the 
builders/interveners that such public interest cases could be heard 
only in the Supreme Court, and admitted the petition.

The lethal ordinance is still in the making with the law department 
of the Sindh government. Governor Soomro should take a second look. 
How much excess baggage can President General Pervez Musharraf 
carry?

<a name="real">Real democracy: the miracle at hand</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

With the election of corps headquarter-approved nazims and naib 
nazims, the spearmen of the real democracy that General Musharraf 
had promised to gift the nation are finally in place. They make a 
princely collection.

Monitored closely by the corps commanders who constitute Gen 
Musharraf's ruling college of bishops, this electoral exercise has 
been carried out with all the single mindedness of a military 
operation. Its objective has been a disarmingly simple one: the 
creation of a military-friendly civilian constituency (forget the 
contradiction in this phrase) for the latest in Pakistan's long 
line of distinguished saviours.

Given the importance of this objective, minor irritants such as 
those the tender-hearted would call democratic niceties have not 
been allowed to stand in the way of its fulfillment. It is a mark 
of this approach that the list of approved candidates was compiled 
in close consultation with the Like-minded or Sarkari League headed 
by Mian Azhar, Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain and Chaudhry Pervez Ellahi-
-the three luminaries who should now be taken as the leading 
apostles of the real democracy to whose tune the country is all set 
to march.

Where the corps commanders had no favourites, the wishes of Mian 
Azhar and the Chaudhries prevailed. But if, as we have seen most 
spectacularly in Rawalpindi, there was a military favourite, 
nothing could block his anointing as the certified candidate of the 
Official League.

It is instructive to dwell a bit on the 'Pindi contender. Before 
these free and fair elections who could have considered Tariq 
Kayani as the front runner? The Chaudhries first chose Raja 
Basharat as their man only to be told (face-to-face) by Commander 
10 Corps, Lt-Gen Jamshed Gulzar Kayani, that the national interest 
was better served by Tariq Kayani (the similarity of surnames being 
entirely coincidental) as Rawalpindi nazim. Not a man to miss the 
writing on the wall, Basharat withdrew his candidature, contenting 
himself with the consolation prize of tehsil nazimship for his 
younger brother.

Ten Corps is the formation whose responsibilities include the 
guarding of the Siachen passes. Hawk-eyed vigilance in the north 
and a keen civic sense in Rawalpindi: this is what is called 
versatility. No one can accuse the modern Pakistan army of not 
being protean in its capabilities.

Similarly illuminating has been the performance of the 6th Armoured 
Division based in Kharian whose commander, Maj-Gen Ghumman, has 
been closely watching the election scene in Chakwal. By now he 
should be as familiar with the political personalities of his 
diocese as with his troops and columns of armour. It is this facet 
of military training, or call it expertise, which gives the 
Pakistan army an edge over its Indian rival. The Indian army is 
narrow in outlook, concerned only with professional militarism 
whereas the Pakistan army with its multifarious responsibilities 
has a range truly Napoleonic in its reach and vision.

A clarification, though, is in order. In north Punjab, the heart of 
the martial belt and the region regarding whose nazim elections I 
can say something, the corps commanders have intervened only at the 
macro or strategic level (military officers being fond of these 
terms), ensuring that the mantle of official candidate fell on the 
right shoulders. They have been clear on one point: no PPP or Nawaz 
Sharif supporter should enter the hallowed circle of nazims, the 
future constituency of Gen Musharraf. Otherwise, to the best of my 
knowledge, there has been no micro-intervention in the form of 
majors or colonels pressuring the administration to get 'positive' 
results. To this extent this election has been free and fair.

But the point to examine is the outcome of this exercise in 
military planning. No better collection of yes-men could have been 
gathered for giving a civilian face to the present order or 
advancing Gen Naqvi's devolution plan--about which we have been 
told that it is the answer to all the country's problems. Are these 
men of straw, in awe of their respective corps commanders, the 
messiahs whose approach the nation has been awaiting?

Indeed, what Gen Musharraf and his knights are asking of the nation 
is nothing less than a total suspension of disbelief. We are being 
asked to forget the non-performance of the last year and a half and 
to believe that a revolution, a quick-fix for all our ills, is at 
hand. In other words, through Gen Naqvi's attempt at administrative 
restructuring, we have at last discovered the Holy Grail.

Credulity needs stretching to believe any of this. Consider the 
talent on offer. Can the army-vetted nazims who will be carrying 
the burden of Gen Naqvi's district engineering be the harbingers of 
a social upheaval? We might with equal assurance believe that 
gilded lilies will sprout from municipal cesspools.

The newly-elected nazims do not come from a crop of fools. Knowing 
the keen interest taken in their welfare by the corps commanders, 
they are all too aware of their real status: pawns in a larger 
power game. From creatures thus elected (or selected) is it at all 
fair to expect justice, impartiality and similar administrative 
wonders? Products of an exercise whose central principle has been 
the lack of even-handedness, are they now expected to discharge 
their district duties in an even-handed manner?

The Like-minded Leaguers are chips off the Nawaz Sharif block, 
people who took part in the loot, plunder and maladministration of 
the decade that Gen Musharraf likes to associate with 'sham' 
democracy. The same people, having been vetted by their respective 
corps commanders, are now being expected to play the role of 
knights in civic armour. We are all entitled to our day-dreams. But 
this one would leave even confirmed Freudians a bit out of breath.

Instead of administrative rigour, far more accurate to think of 
administrative vandalization. The western embassies and donor 
agencies pushing the devolution plan and saying it is the best 
thing to come Pakistan's way will have a lot to answer for. Wait 
till the nazims get into their stride. The mismanagement of the 
last year and a half will pale by comparison.

 Hitherto, politicians used the bureaucracy to win power and 
influence. Now it is the politico, in the form of the nazim, who 
will sit atop the bureaucratic pyramid. Who is to prevent him from 
misusing this power? Gen Musharraf and his mentor in this sphere, 
Gen Naqvi, take this change to be the key to the golden kingdom. 
Concentration of authority in any field has been the ruin of 
Pakistan. Is it likely to be any different in this instance?

Of course devolution of power is a good thing. Sure, the old 
administrative system needed a knocking. Equally certain, the old 
deputy commissioner and commissioner's offices had outlived their 
utility. But let us not forget the relationship between end and 
means. Are the likes of Mian Azhar and Chaudhry Shujaat going to 
lead the nation to the promised land? Are the nazims of what must 
now be called the Official League going to be the heralds of a new 
dispensation?

Let us not fool ourselves. At issue is not any question of 
administrative regeneration as the think-tankers of the regime 
would have the nation believe. At stake is the creation of a 
civilian base for the military government. Once the nazims assume 
control of their district baronies, attention will turn to the next 
stage of real democracy: the election of military-friendly 
assemblies, at the centre and in the provinces.

Nor, if we care to remember the Ayub model with its docile and 
quiescent legislatures, is this such an unlikely outcome. The 
valuable election experience gathered by the corps commanders makes 
it entirely possible for the Ayubian model to be replicated in the 
coming round as well.

But why quarrel with the inevitable? I for my part have pre-empted 
even the smartest gunslingers by being the first to offer my 
congratulations to Gen Musharraf for the successful outcome of the 
nazim elections.

On Wednesday morning as he met a group of us journalists who had 
carried the Pakistan flag at Agra I told him, full two days before 
the event, to rest easy because the right kind of nazims, their 
hearts in the right place, were being elected. To his credit, he 
did not take my remark amiss, his embarrassment lasting for no more 
than a passing second.

<a name="pcbn">PCB not to allow ICC sleuths to grill Inzamam</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Aug 3: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said it would not 
make Inzamam-ul-Haq available to International Cricket Council's 
Anti-Corruption Unit for interview.

"There is no question of allowing Inzamam to appear before Sir Paul 
Condon's unit when Pakistan has a packed and demanding 
international season," a top PCB official said. The ICC sleuths 
want to investigate Inzamam in connection with their probe against 
betting and match-fixing. The Pakistan vice- captain, fined 
Rs300,000 by Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum for hiding facts, has 
again been targeted by Condon's men and the English media.

The latest allegations against Inzamam revolved around his second 
ball duck against Australia in the tri-nation one-day tournament in 
England. Inzamam danced down the track against Shane Warne only to 
be stumped by Adam Gilchrist.

According to highly placed sources, Condon has reported the latest 
allegations against Inzamam to the PCB and has urged Pakistan 
authorities to allow his unit to question him. PCB chairman Lt Gen 
Tauqir Zia neither confirmed nor denied the report but admitted 
that three Pakistan players were grilled by ICC sleuths during 
Pakistan's tour to England that concluded in June.

"Saeed Anwar, Shahid Afridi and Waqar Younis were questioned by ICC 
investigators who were also supposed to examine Inzamam but he was 
not available. After the England tour, Inzamam proceeded to United 
States and has just returned," Zia said. But the PCB boss said he 
would not like his senior most batsman to pass through mental 
trauma of facing investigators at a time when Pakistan has to play 
12 Tests and around 20 one-day internationals.

Inzamam, talking to Dawn from Multan, said he would wait for 
instructions from PCB before proceeding to England to face ICC 
investigators. But he minced no words to express his frustration. 
"Every player is sick of these allegations and I am no different. I 
am fed-up. I just don't understand why every dismissal or team's 
defeat is linked to ungamely tactics.

"Naturally, these allegations affect the concentration of the 
player because every time he walks out in the centre, he has it in 
the back of his mind that if he fails to deliver, he will be under 
suspicion," Inzamam said.

The PCB, which has come down hard when it comes to defending 
players for the right reasons, further said it would not get the 
allegations investigated by its inquiry committee. "There is no 
need to toe the line of media allegations and start inquiries," Zia 
said. However, the general said Justice Bhandari's inquiry into 
World Cup allegations which had to be submitted to the ICC has been 
delayed.

"Although the President has appointed Justice Bhandari, the Law 
Secretary has yet to release a notification," he said, adding that 
the inquiry was unlikely to be completed before the start of fresh 
season. "I would have liked to close this chapter before the season 
starts. But now, either Justice Bhandari's inquiry will be held 
between a six-week gap after the Sharjah tournament and tour to 
Bangladesh or after the conclusion of the season in March-April.

"I will be meeting Justice Bhandari on Saturday and will seek his 
plan of action. But frankly speaking, I would not like to bother my 
players during the season," Zia said. Justice Bhandari will be 
probing the allegations levelled by former South African board's 
managing director Ali Bacher that Pakistan deliberately threw World 
Cup matches to Bangladesh and India. Bhandari will also be probing 
Bacher's claims that retired Test umpire Javed Akhtar had been on 
the pay-roll of the bookies.

<a name="waqa">Waqar retained captain for home series against Kiwis </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 3: Paceman Waqar Younis was retained as Pakistan 
captain for a three-Test and as many one-day internationals home 
series against New Zealand starting Sept 19.

The chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Lt Gen Tauqir Zia 
told Dawn from Lahore that although his establishment would like 
Waqar to continue till the 2003 World Cup, decision on his future 
would be made after analyzing his form and fitness. "According to 
our policy, Waqar has initially been appointed captain till the 
home series against New Zealand. Inzamam-ul-Haq will continue to 
serve as vice-captain," Zia said.

Waqar replaced an out of favour Moin Khan for the Sharjah and 
England tours in March where Pakistan put up a mixed performance. 
Nevertheless, Waqar's own performance remained outstanding when he 
finished with 17 wickets in the England tri-nation one-day 
competition.

After the New Zealand tour, Pakistan are to play in a three- nation 
tournament in Sharjah and then proceed to Bangladesh for a two-Test 
series before hosting West Indies for a three-Test series. "Waqar 
will be conveyed about his additional responsibilities for the 
second half of the international season in advance," Zia said, 
hinting that the pacer would be entrusted with captaincy for the 
entire season during the New Zealand series.

The appointment means Waqar will also captain Pakistan in the 
icebreaking Test against India at Lahore in the Asian Test 
Championship between Sept 12 and 16. Waqar made his Test debut 
against India at Karachi in 1989-90. The PCB chief said he was 
pleased with Waqar's individual performance and the way the team 
had responded under his leadership. "But we don't like to jump the 
guns. Although I am confident that Waqar will maintain the highest 
standards of fitness, we have to stick to our policy of appointing 
captains on series-by-series basis," he said.

Zia admitted that Pakistan lacked Waqar's replacement as captain. 
"Inzamam is the vice-captain but that doesn't necessarily mean that 
he is the future captain. We have Saeed Anwar and Rashid Latif but 
I don't want to hand over the charge to Rashid because he has just 
forced his way into the team. "He (Rashid) still requires time to 
adjust to the rigors of international cricket. It would be 
unjustified if he is handed over this demanding job. "Besides this 
senior trio, the others are inexperienced."

The PCB supremo said the decision to retain Waqar was not difficult 
in the backdrop of his and team's performance in Sharjah and 
England. The general said the PCB would award contracts to a select 
group of players before the international season begins with the 
Test against Bangladesh at Multan from Aug 29.

He said half a dozen players would be awarded contracts but didn't 
promise that the players would be from the 27 named to attend the 
training camp starting in Karachi from Aug 6. "Before we award 
contracts, two things have to be gauged. Firstly, do we have enough 
funds in our coffers and secondly, will our players be at par with 
other teams.

"The basic objective of awarding contracts is to avoid the 
embarrassment of players entering into individual deals with PCB 
sponsors competitors," he said, with reference to players agreement 
with Coca Cola which put the PCB in an awkward situation as Pepsi 
is the team's sponsor.

NEW DELHI, July 30: Government reiterated its stand that bilateral 
cricket series with Pakistan could not be allowed under 'present 
circumstances' but the Indian team was free to play against that 
country in multilateral tournaments.

"After taking all the relevant factors into consideration, the 
government has come to the view that circumstances prevailing at 
present are not fully conducive for Indian cricket team to play 
bilateral matches against Pakistan," Minister of State of Sports 
Pon Radhakirishnan said on Monday in a written reply in Lok Sabha.

"There is, however, generally no objection to playing against 
Pakistan in multilateral matches at regular venues," he said. To a 
related question, the minister said there was no proposal for 
organizing hockey matches between the two countries. "The 
Government will take a decision on receipt of the proposal in this 
regard," he said.

<a name="wasi">Wasim to coach youngsters </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 1: Six cricket clinics to train youngsters in two age-
groups are being established at six major cities of the country. 
The first group of boys to be chosen for the clinics will be 
between the ages of 10-13 and the second between the ages of 14-16.

For setting-up the clinics, a contract was signed between former 
Pakistan captain Wasim Akram, who will be heading the group of Test 
stars engaged as coaches, and a multi-national soft-drink company. 
Wasim will be assisted by Test cricketers Abdul Razzaq, Shahid 
Afridi, Imran Nazir, Mohammad Sami and Imran Farhat.

The open trials to select the boys will be held at the Lahore City 
Cricket Association (LCCA) ground, Sunday (Aug 5) at 9.00am. 
Besides Lahore, the same exercise will also be held at Karachi, 
Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Multan and Peshawar. Pakistan Cricket Board 
(PCB), as in the past, will again be co-operating with the sponsor 
company in making the clinics a success. The PCB coaches will be 
scouting talent while the clinics will be in progress.

After selecting boys, clinics will be run for six weeks. At the end 
of training on Sept 18, talented cricketers will be short-listed at 
each of the six cities to form 16-member teams. Matches will be 
organized among the teams of each center. Speaking on the occasion, 
Wasim Akram said that Pakistan was blessed with abundant talent 
that the boys participating in these clinics would have the 
advantage of learning from our experience.

<a name="pcbs">PCB's double-standards over fitness of players</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Imran Naeem Ahmed

ISLAMABAD, Aug 1: Pakistan cricket chief, Lt. Gen Tauqir Zia said 
that both Wasim Akram and wicketkeeper Moin Khan would have to 
prove their form and fitness if they cherish any hopes of returning 
to the national team.

Both Akram and Moin were dropped Tuesday from a list of 27 
probables announced by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for a 
training camp ahead of this month's Bangladesh match of the Asian 
Test Championship.

"They have to prove themselves in domestic cricket if they want to 
make a comeback," said the general who did not appear too happy 
with the "attitude" of some of the senior players. The selectors, 
headed by Wasim Bari chose wicketkeepers Rashid Latif and Atiq-uz-
Zaman leaving out Moin to rue his fate.

Tauqir dismissed the impression that Shoaib Akhtar, who is among 
the probables, was injured. "He has no fitness problems."  Fingers 
are being raised again over the inclusion of this injury-prone 
bowler who has spent more time in recent months watching cricket 
from the dressing room at the cost of PCB's money than actually 
playing it.

His injuries have cost the board millions but the fatherly PCB 
officials continue to pamper him hoping that one day he might pay 
them back in form of taking wickets, the prime duty of a strike 
bowler.

While Tauqir did not say much about Shoaib, he disclosed that 
Mohammad Sami and Shabbir Ahmad who are still recovering from 
injuries have been included in the list of probables so that they 
could practice with the other players which would help them regain 
fitness.

Asked if the PCB had now given up its search for a foreign coach 
following the refusal this week of South African Kepler Wessels, 
Tauqir said: "We have not given up but will continue our hunt. He 
did not say who the board was presently pursuing. Australian Darryl 
Foster, South-Africa born Richard Pybus and Englishman C. 
Medlycott, have all expressed their inability to take up long-term 
coaching assignments in Pakistan.

Tauqir said that Sikander Bakht had been appointed coach because he 
was based in Karachi, the venue for the training camp beginning 
from Aug 6. "We have no intention of giving him a long term 
appointment," said the general. Meanwhile, Pakistan batsman 
Inzamam-ul-Haq has been refused permission to play, reportedly for 
a World XI in England.

Inzamam, who phoned up Tauqir Wednesday to seek permission, was 
told that it would be better if he concentrated on playing for 
Pakistan. He was told by the general that he could not grant him 
permission with the training camp about to start and the Asian Test 
Championship looming. Inzamam was to get a purse of 2000 pounds for 
playing the match.

<a name="blue">'Blue-eyed' Shoaib named in probables: Wasim, Moin axed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, July 31: Pakistan selectors have left out veteran Wasim 
Akram and Moin Khan from the 27 probables to attend the national 
senior training camp due to be held at the National Stadium, 
Karachi, from Aug 6.

It appears that Wasim Akram has been finally shown the door while 
Moin's future hangs in balance as the selectors headed by Wasim 
Bari have picked Atiq uz Zaman as Rashid Latif's deputy. However 
injury-prone and controversial Shoaib Akhtar, - despite his poor 
record as Test bowler and millions of rupees wasted on him over the 
years - once again finds favor with the selectors.

Even young Mohammad Sami who was also unfit but toured England and 
remained with the team as a "joyrider" gets the selectors nod 
although he was reported to be suffering from a stress fracture of 
the shin. "Indispensible" Yawar Saeed has been retained as manager 
and former Test paceman Sikandar Bakht, who earlier quit as 
selector, once again has been rewarded with the job of camp coach.

Probables: Imran Nazir, Imran Farhat, Taufiq Umar, Saeed Anwar, 
Faisal Iqbal, Hasan Raza, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Yousaf Youhana, Younis 
Khan, Abdur Razzaq, Danish Kanaira, Rashid Latif, Waqar Younis, 
Irfan Fazil, Shabbir Ahmad, Mohammad Sami, Naveed Lateef, Rana 
Naveed, Shahid Afridi, Saqlain Mushtaq. Atiq-uz-Zaman, 
ShoaibAkhtar, FazleAkbar, Mohammad Akram, Yasir Arafat, 
AzharMahmood and Shoaib Malik.
