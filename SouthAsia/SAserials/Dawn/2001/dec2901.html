<a name="mush">Musharraf rules out war: India responsible for tension</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec 28: President Gen Pervez Musharraf has ruled out the 
possibility of war with India but said there could be some 
skirmishes on the Line of Control.

"I can safely say that 95 per cent chances of war do not exist... 
but there are just 5 per cent such chances and that too in the 
shape of some skirmishes on the Line of Control," the president was 
quoted as having said during his luncheon meeting with members of 
the Economic Advisory Board.

However, official sources said, the president had told the meeting 
that Pakistan was alert to take on the enemy should it tried to do 
any misadventure whether on the LoC or on the international 
borders.

Gen Musharraf pointed out that the country was much better off 
today than in 70s when India had provided all military support for 
the creation of Bangladesh. "Our stock position in every respect is 
very satisfactory and our reserves are also gradually improving and 
have reached to an all time high in 53 years of the country's 
history," he was quoted as having said. If the enemy underestimated 
or miscalculated, it would be a big loser, he warned.

The president said that India had raised a war temperature and was 
now experiencing difficulties to bring it down. He regretted that 
Indian leaders were sounding too arrogant and had refused to settle 
issues through peaceful means.

Sources said the president had also told the meeting that all 
necessary measures had been taken to protect every inch of land and 
that the country's armed forces had been mobilized to face any 
eventuality.

The president advised the EAB members, who included prominent 
investors, to invest in the country so that foreign investors could 
be encouraged to follow suit. The president inquired the investors 
about any complaint they had or assistance they needed, and said 
his government would provide all possible support to have more and 
more business activities in the country.

<a name="indi">India's pressure on Pakistan may backfire: diplomats</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 28: India's mounting pressure on Pakistan, unopposed 
by the United States and Britain, could hamper President Pervez 
Musharraf's attempts to curb radical groups, diplomats say.

"If India pulls too hard on the cord, it could break," said a 
senior diplomat based in Islamabad. Pakistan has already frozen the 
assets of Lashkar-i-Taiba and Jaish-i- Mohammad and arrested the 
founding head of the Jaish, Maulana Masood Azhar. However, the 
public response from New Delhi has been dismissive.

Western diplomats say the United States and Britain "seem to be 
helping relay the Indian message in order to extract more 
concessions from Islamabad" in cracking down on radical groups. 
However, analysts believe this "Indo-American collusion" is 
dangerous because the Pakistan government "cannot be allowed to 
lose face" over Kashmir.

"It would be wiser to win the confidence of the Pakistani 
government and to let it implement, at its rate and rhythm, 
measures which it is weighing" against the religious extremists, 
said an Islamabad-based ambassador.

The actions taken by India "complicate Musharraf's task, and risk 
delaying by six months measures that could have been taken right 
away", he said.

Washington, which is pursuing its own goals in Afghanistan, is 
starting to become aware of the dangers of pushing Pakistan too 
far, particularly after it obliged by turning its back on the 
Taliban after Sept 11.

US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, anxious about the possibility 
that Pakistani troops massed at the Afghan border could be shifted 
east to Kashmir, stresses the importance of Islamabad's role in 
hunting down remaining Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.

Rumsfeld said it was "very encouraging" that Pakistan had not yet 
withdrawn forces from the Afghan border, and added that any 
redeployment "would be a big disappointment".

On the India-Pakistan tensions, Rumsfeld said the United States had 
clearly informed the nuclear rivals that their rapidly escalating 
standoff could detract from its war on terrorism.

"This is something we're keeping our eye on very carefully, and we 
have clearly made the interests we have in this subject known to 
both sides very carefully and with clarity," he said.-AFP

<a name="isla">Islamabad hits back </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Dec 27: In response to a move by New Delhi, Pakistan 
announced reducing the staff of the Indian High Commission in 
Islamabad by 50 per cent, limiting the movement of the embassy 
staff to the municipal limits of the capital, and banning its 
airspace to Indian Airlines flights from Jan 1.

A Foreign Office spokesman in a press release said that the 
government of Pakistan had noted with disappointment the decisions 
of the Indian government to cut the staff strength of the Pakistan 
High Commission in New Delhi by 50pc, restrict the movement of the 
HC officials within the municipal limits of New Delhi and deny 
Indian airspace to PIA flights from Jan 1.

"While regretting the escalation measures announced by India, the 
government of Pakistan has been constrained to take reciprocal 
action in equal measure," he said. Another source said that India's 
deputy high commissioner Sudhir Vias was summoned to the Foreign 
Office and conveyed the decision taken by Pakistan.

India had withdrawn its High Commissioner Vijay Nambiar last week 
as part of tough measures being taken in phases against Pakistan 
following the Dec 13 attack on its parliament. Pakistan, in line 
with its unilateral policy of maximum restraint, did not recall its 
High Commissioner from New Delhi, which was regarded in diplomatic 
circles a departure from the tit-for-tat tradition.

<a name="hast">India has to achieve 'objectives': envoy </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Intikhab Hanif and Amjad Mahmood

LAHORE, Dec 27: Indian Deputy High Commissioner Sudhir Vyas refused 
to rule out war against Pakistan, saying, "India has some 
objectives which have to be achieved." Various options were open to 
India and a "final decision" would be taken as the situation 
evolved, he told Dawn at the Wagah checkpoint on his arrival from 
New Delhi. 

"No one wants war. But Pakistan must take action against the groups 
which, apparently, have been involved in violence and attack on 
Indian parliament," he said. Mr Vyas is in charge of the Indian 
High Commission in Islamabad after the withdrawal of HC Vijay 
Nambiar on December 21.

He said the seriousness and enormity of the attack on parliament 
had left a deep impression on India and its people. "The incident 
was seen as an attack on our sovereignty and in response, Pakistan 
must take steps against the groups involved in it," he said in 
reply to the question whether India wanted to take a retaliatory 
action against Pakistan.

Asked to explain the term "objectives" he had used the envoy said 
it was incumbent on Pakistan to take action against the groups 
"involved" in violence in India. "The objectives, which India wants 
to achieve, will have to be achieved," he reiterated.

When pointed out that Pakistan had already taken action against 
some Jihadi groups and wanted to go further if India provided any 
evidence of their involvement in the attack, the envoy described 
the action as a cosmetic one. "These are only media reports and we 
want credible measures."

He parried a question why India was not responding to Pakistan's 
offer for a joint investigation into the attack on parliament to 
find out who was really behind that. Asked what action Pakistan 
should take, Mr Vyas said: "There is no need to give details as 
Pakistan government already knows it."

<a name="piat">PIA to end flights on 4 routes</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Dec 28: Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) said it 
would suspend flights to four Asian destinations because of India's 
decision to ban Pakistan overflights. PIA's Chief Operating Office 
Khursheed Anwar told Reuters that weekly flights for Colombo, 
Maldives, Manila and Singapore would be suspended from Jan 1 
pending further decision.

India decided to halt PIA overflights, halve India's diplomatic 
mission in Islamabad and Pakistan's mission in New Delhi and 
restrict the movement of Pakistani diplomats.

PIA said around 23 of its weekly flights would be hit after the 
closure of Indian airspace. "Operations for these countries would 
no longer be economically viable...while we will incur extra cost 
on Bangkok and Tokyo operations which will be carried out through 
Chinese airspace," he added.

Anwar said PIA would face a drop of five per cent in its annual 
operational revenues, "which is negligible." PIA cut 15 per cent of 
its flights in October because of a sharp drop in air travel since 
the Sept 11 attacks on the United States.

Anwar said it had applied to India for permission to operate extra 
flights to New Delhi and Bombay before Jan 1 to bring Pakistanis 
home.

"If Indian authorities allow us, we would operate extra flights," 
he added. PIA spokesman Imran Gardazi said India had asked the 
airlines to withdraw its staff in India within 48 hours after Jan 
1.-Reuters

<a name="pres">President to attend Saarc summit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 28: President Pervez Musharraf will attend next 
week's South Asian summit in Nepal despite India's decision to 
close its airspace to Pakistani planes, officials said. "President 
Musharraf will attend the Saarc conference in Kathmandu," a foreign 
ministry official told AFP. India later said it would allow Gen 
Musharraf to fly through Indian airspace if Islamabad made a 
special request.

Doubts surfaced about the viability of the Jan 4-6 South Asian 
Association for Regional Cooperation summit after India on Thursday 
announced new sanctions, including barring Pakistani aircraft from 
its skies.

Under Saarc's charter all members must be present for a meeting to 
take place, and the move was seen as making it difficult for Gen 
Musharraf to attend by forcing him to make a major detour. However, 
Pakistani officials said privately that after debate, it was 
decided to push ahead with the trip despite the difficult 
circumstances.

The conference had been considered a valuable opportunity for the 
Indian and Pakistani leaders to meet and try to resolve their 
differences, particularly after July's failed summit in Agra.

India said earlier this month that Prime Minister Atal Behari 
Vajpayee would not meet Gen Musharraf given the current tensions. 
However, Pakistani foreign ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said 
that Gen Musharraf would be willing to meet Mr Vajpayee for talks 
during the summit.

"We have always said that we want dialogue and talks at any level, 
any time and anywhere. It is for India to respond to our move. The 
ball is in India's court. We have done our part," he said. Saarc, 
founded in 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, 
Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.-AFP

<a name="saar">Saarc: India says no to talks with Pakistan </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW DELHI, Dec 27: Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh rejected 
the possibility of talks with Pakistan, but added that next week's 
summit of South Asian leaders in Nepal would go ahead as scheduled. 
Singh said suggestions by the United States for the two countries 
to have a dialogue may be well meant, but it was not practical at 
this moment.

"I don't think advocating of dialogue between India and Pakistan is 
any kind of evil. I might not accept the advocacy. That is 
different," he said, in response to a question about US Secretary 
of State Colin Powell's call for talks.

"Of course, I think the secretary of state is fully entitled to 
suggest that the two countries have a dialogue. What difference 
does it make? (But) it is not practical, it is not possible. I have 
told him. He knows it." -AFP

<a name="moun">Pressure mounts to stall war rhetoric</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Dec 26: Urgent diplomatic moves were afoot involving key 
embassies in New Delhi and their worried governments back home to 
stall the spiralling nuclear rhetoric on both sides of the India-
Pakistan border before it all begins to spin out of control, 
diplomats and analysts said.

British Prime Minister Tony Blair is due to visit New Delhi early 
next month, ostensibly on a wide-ranging bilateral visit, but 
clearly to lend his voice to global worries on the stand-off with 
Pakistan too. By then, diplomats said, the United States, Russia 
and China will have already been busy consulting, advising and even 
cajoling New Delhi and Islamabad to back down from the precipice.

"We could see some very important efforts out of Washington in the 
next couple of days or so," an informed source in the diplomatic 
corps told Dawn. "We will see it happening soon. They are a worried 
lot out there." There were indeed worrying signals in New Delhi 
where the government declared that "owing to the large-scale 
deployment of troops and armor along the borders following 
Pakistani military build-up," India's Army Day January 15 parade 
was being called off.

The cancellation of the parade, when the might of the Indian Army 
is put on display at the military cantonment in Delhi, follows 
deployment of Army formations along the borders, a defense ministry 
official said. The government clarified however that the Republic 
Day parade, also involving military units, would be held on January 
26 as usual.

Despite the mounting tension, there were a few straws in the wind 
to suggest a little more reassuring picture. For example the news 
that Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee would certainly attend the 
SAARC summit in Kathmandu from January 4 was important, 
particularly the fact that it was announced by External Affairs 
Minister Jaswant Singh after a meeting of the Cabinet.

Some diplomats cited reports about both sides moving their missile 
units close to strategic locations as a worrying development, the 
first such, they said, since 1987 and 1990 when the United States 
had intervened to effectively thwart a potential nuclear exchange 
between India and Pakistan.

Most western embassies have cancelled their Christmas and New Year 
holiday plans to keep key personnel in the Indian capital as the 
war rhetoric looks more palpable with every fresh statement from 
New Delhi and Islamabad. And the rhetoric came from no 
insignificant quarters either. President Pervez Musharraf's tough 
words were joined by the head of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata 
Party who said if Pakistan "uses nuclear weapons against us, 
Pakistan will be wiped off from the face of the earth."

Amid the gloom, newspaper surveys however showed that most Indians 
did not yet believe the rhetoric would lead to war. One online 
newspaper had 63 percent against 36 saying they did not believe a 
war was nigh.

>From Moscow President Vladimir Putin spoke to Prime Minister Atal 
Behari Vajpayee shortly before the Christmas holidays and although 
details of their talks were not available Russia is believed to be 
seriously concerned about the military build-up on both sides.

The Press Trust of India in a dispatch from Beijing quoted a senior 
official at the Asia Desk of the Chinese foreign ministry as urging 
India and Pakistan to exercise restraint. "We have paid attention 
to concerned reports. We appeal to the concerned sides to exercise 
restraint and maintain calm, from the point of view of protecting 
the overall peace and stability in South Asia," Chinese foreign 
ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said. "We also urge the concerned 
sides to hold peaceful talks and dialogue for solving the 
disputes," she said.

The remarks prompted a withering Indian response. "China's call for 
restraint should be directed at Pakistan. It is for Pakistan to 
take action against the terrorist outfits operating from that 
country."

There have been similar views expressed in senior political 
quarters about American calls for calm too, with people including 
Defence Minister George Fernandes hardly concealing their anger at 
the alleged double standards they say Washington has in the global 
fight against terrorism.

The report from the apex Cabinet Committee on Security, which met 
at Vajpayee's residence, was an assortment of the grim laced with 
some assuring words too. A CCS review was rescheduled as Fernandes, 
touring the Himalayan frontline regions, was stranded there due to 
bad weather. "India has taken all measures required to protect its 
borders with Pakistan and would continue to be alert to the 
situation," External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh, told reporters 
after the CCS chaired by Vajpayee.

On Pakistan's claim of freezing assets of Lashkar-i-Taiba and 
Jaish-i-Mohammad, Singh said: "I must make it clear that a kind of 
trickery, that is simply changing names, shifting headquarters from 
one part of Pakistan to another or to indulge in cosmetic seizure 
of assets is really to make a mockery of the gravity of the 
situation and the enormity of the issues that we confront."

Asked whether India would use other options to pressurize Pakistan, 
the minister merely said, "all issues were considered and will be 
re-examined in totality tomorrow when the CCS meets again."

Singh said Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Vijay Nambiar would 
participate in CCS meeting. He said: "The High Commissioner will be 
called to the CCS and required to share whatever he discussed 
before departing from Islamabad".

In an interview to Aaj Tak news channel, Defence Minister George 
Fernandes said diplomatic efforts are on to put pressure on 
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf to stop supporting terrorism 
across the border. The minister added that both United States and 
United Kingdom have advised Pakistan on the issue, however, New 
Delhi is unsure whether their efforts will yield positive results.

Fernandes was also quoted by PTI as saying that India's missile 
systems are "in position" and that the Indian Army's training 
exercises will be held as scheduled in Rajasthan and Punjab in the 
first half of January.

Asked if there was a possibility of a change in the schedule for 
exercises in view of the Pakistani military build-up, Fernandes 
said "there has been no talk of change of schedule. They will be 
routine exercises".

Some opposition parties, led by the Left front, have accused the 
government of whipping up war hysteria against Pakistan to benefit 
from a nationalist upsurge in key state elections. The Election 
Commission on Wednesday announced that the next round of Assembly 
elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttaranchal and Manipur would 
be held between Feb 13 and 21 next year. Also, by-elections for six 
Lok Sabha and six Assembly seats in various states will be held 
simultaneously on February 21.

Meanwhile, villagers in several border areas of Samba sector have 
moved to safer places due to continued firing by Pakistani troops 
from across the International Border in Jammu division, official 
sources were quoted by the PTI as saying. Due to "heavy exchange of 
fire between Indian and Pakistani troops, people from many forward 
villages of Samba sector have been moving to the interiors since 
last four days," the sources said, adding some of them were taking 
shelter in government buildings or with their relatives in 
adjoining villages.

<a name="miss">Missiles not shifted to border, says ISPR</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 26: Pakistan has not moved its missiles towards 
border and India is lying about it to justify its own military 
build-up, Director General, ISPR, Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi said.

In an interview to BBC television, he said it was absolutely 
incorrect to say that Pakistan was moving artillery and missiles 
towards the border. "It is another Indian lie. Pakistan has not 
moved missiles towards the border. India continues to tell lies in 
order to justify its own build-up," he said. "They (India) have 
moved all their formations to the border. We know it. We are 
monitoring that and as a defensive measure we will just move 
minimum troops, if we have to," he said, adding but at present 
Indians "are absolutely incorrect when they say Pakistan has moved 
missiles to the border."

Pakistan is not engaged in any propaganda and is just telling the 
truth, he said in reply to a question. "It is India, which has done 
this after Sept 11, when they found to their frustration that the 
whole world has formed the coalition, including Pakistan, against 
terrorism," he added.

He said India was frustrated, as it was not India that was being 
asked to assist, so they started making up things "which have no 
basis." They hijacked their own air-craft and blamed Pakistan for 
it. They arranged strange happenings in India and blamed Pakistan 
and its intelligence agencies for that. "So it is they who are 
engaged in propaganda," he maintained.-APP

<a name="arme">Armed forces fully prepared, says PAF chief</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 22: Chief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Mushaf 
Ali Mir said that the defence forces of Pakistan are fully prepared 
to give a matching response in case of any misadventure from across 
the border.

"There is nothing to be worried about; Pakistan's armed forces are 
fully prepared," he said while talking to media-men after 
inaugurating a seminar on "Role of air power in the 21st century" 
at the Institute of Strategic Studies.

"There is some military build-up and preparations across the 
eastern border and we are fully aware of the situation", he said 
adding that the commanders had been undertaking series of brain- 
storming sessions to streamline strategies to effectively counter 
in case of misadventure from across the border.

"We are fully prepared and can take any challenge," he said when 
his attention was drawn to the recent build-up by India following 
fresh purchases of military hardware. He said India had 800 
aircraft while Pakistan had 350 combat- ready planes, but "our 
efficient force can overwhelm them."

The PAF chief said that, in addition to this, 10 Chinese-made F7-PG 
aircraft would be reaching Pakistan next week and a similar number 
of planes had already arrived in Pakistan. The remaining 20 
aircraft, out of 40, according to a deal, would arrive in Pakistan 
in a couple of months.

The first prototype of Super-7 aircraft (a Pak-China joint venture 
being executed in Pakistan Aeronautical Complex)) would roll out by 
June 2003, while its regular production was expected to start in 
2004-05, the PAF chief added.

"We are well aware that India had been preparing since the Kargil 
war and have inducted some new hardware and are in process of 
inducting some other. Seeing the situation, we have been making all 
out efforts to keep the minimum level of deterrence in the nuclear 
and conventional sectors", he said. Referring to Pakistan-China 
relations, with special regard to defence, he said:" We already 
have a number of pacts of strategic nature with our friendly 
countries which have always been standing with us through thick and 
thin". -APP

<a name="govt">Govt's policies have isolated Pakistan in the world</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

RAWALPINDI, Dec 28: Pakistan has been isolated in the world because 
of the government's wrong policies, the acting Jamaat-i- Islami 
Amir Rawalpindi city, Syed Uzair Hamid said.

Syed Uzair Hamid lamented on the government's foreign policy which 
enabled India to become aggressive towards Pakistan. He said the 
United States was the biggest terrorist in the world, and demanded 
of the government to expel the Americans out of the country.

He further criticized the double standards adopted by the US, and 
said: "If two US buildings are destroyed, it is terrorism, but, if 
tens of thousands of people are killed in Afghanistan, Kashmir and 
Palestine, it is not terrorism."

The JI Amir Rawalpindi district, Abbas Butt, said India had 
gathered its forces along the Line of Control, and was ready to 
launch an attack on Pakistan. He asked the government to remain 
active and take political leaders, masses, lawyers, students and 
common men into confidence for a joint strategy to counter any 
Indian aggression.

The naib amir JI Rawalpindi district, Maulana Abdul Jalil, said the 
country was passing through the worst economic and political 
crisis. The JI had always rendered sacrifices for the country and 
it would not hesitate to do so in future also, he added.

He asked the government to release the leaders of religious parties 
and create an atmosphere that would enable all patriotic elements 
to form a joint strategy for the defence of the country.

The president of Shabab Milli Rawalpindi, Haji Tahir Khan, in his 
speech, said the country was facing severe threats due to the 
government's policies. India is threatening Pakistan of dire 
consequences, but, the government was not taking steps to counter 
these threats. He demanded of the government to release JI Amir 
Qazi Hussain Ahmad if it wanted peace in the country and public 
support.

The Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan leader, Farooq Amin, said the 
government should release all detained leaders of the JI and 
Pakistan-Afghanistan Defence Council.

Speaking to the participants of the rally, the former JI MPA, 
Chaudhry Tanveer held President Pervez Musharraf responsible for 
the killings of innocent people in Afghanistan. He warned the 
government to release Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Maulana Fazlur Rehman, 
otherwise, the situation in the country would deteriorate.

Heavy contingent of the police and elite force were also present on 
the occasion to avert any untoward incident. The police had blocked 
traffic from Fawara Chowk to Gawalmandi Chowk which caused 
inconvenience to the public.

<a name="paki">Pakistanis wanted by US identified</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shamsul Islam Naz

FAISALABAD, Dec 27: The federal government has circulated the names 
of four Pakistanis, reportedly wanted by the US in connection with 
the Sept 11 carnage, among the investigation agencies.

Reliable sources told this correspondent that the government had 
directed Federal Investigation Agency, Special Branch and 
Intelligence Bureau to verify details furnished by the US 
government about the "wanted persons" accused of directly or 
indirectly involved in the New York and Washington attacks, and 
submit report at the earliest.

Three of the wanted persons have an identical name but their 
passport numbers differ. The names, as furnished by the US, are: 
Ahmed Fayaz, date of birth 1973, passport No. E132230; Ashfaq 
Mohammad, date of birth 1954, passport No E925990; Ashfaq Mohammad, 
date of birth 1962, passport No C924913 and Ashfaq Mohammad, date 
of birth 1973, passport No B012156.

One of the accused, Ashfaq Mohammad (passport No C924913), is a 
local but he told FIA that his passport was stolen sometime back. 
He also produced a copy of the FIR. Sources said the agencies had 
also been told by the government to collect bio-data, details about 
character, living standard, and moral activities of the accused.

<a name="usde">US declares LT, Jaish groups terrorist </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza

WASHINGTON, Dec 26: The United States has formally placed Lashkar-
i-Tayyaba and Jaish-i-Mohammad on the state department's list of 
officially designated terrorist organizations. The move was widely 
expected after the US last week blocked the financial assets of the 
two groups following the Dec 13 attack on the Indian parliament.

The organizations were also publicly named by President George Bush 
as being responsible for terrorist activities against India, 
seeking to harm Indo-Pakistan relations, and working to undermine 
the authority of President Gen Pervez Musharraf.

India has been blaming Jaish and the Lashkar for the parliament 
attack. Another organization with links to Kashmir, Harkatul 
Mujahideen, is already on the US list of designated terrorist 
organizations.

In a statement, Secretary of State Colin Powell said he was 
designating the two as "Foreign Terrorist Organizations under US 
law. These groups, which claim to be supporting the people of 
Kashmir, have conducted numerous terrorist attacks in India and 
Pakistan. As the recent horrific attacks against the Indian 
parliament and the Srinagar state legislative assembly so clearly 
show, the Lashkar-i-Tayyaba, Jaish-i-Mohammed, and their ilk seek 
to assault democracy, undermine peace and stability in South Asia, 
and destroy relations between India and Pakistan."

By designating these groups as foreign terrorist organizations, Mr 
Powell said, "we implement the provisions of the Anti-terrorism and 
Effective Death Penalty Act. This act makes it illegal for persons 
in the United States or subject to US jurisdiction to provide 
material support to these terrorist groups; it requires US 
financial institutions to block assets held by them; and it enables 
us to deny visas to representatives of these groups. I made this 
decision in consultation with the attorney general and the 
secretary of the treasury after an exhaustive review of these 
groups' violent activities. The United States looks forward to 
working with the governments of both India and Pakistan to shut 
these groups down".

The state department's latest move amidst a tense standoff between 
Pakistan and India over New Delhi's demands for action against 
Pakistan-based militant organizations is interpreted here as a step 
designed to mollify India and restrain it from precipitating any 
military adventure.

<a name="unmo">UN move to freeze UTN accounts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

UNITED NATIONS, Dec 27: The UN security council's sanctions 
committee on Afghanistan ordered its members to freeze the finances 
of Ummah-Tameer-i-Nau (UTN) and three Pakistanis accused by the 
United States of offering to help Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda 
network to make nuclear weapons.

Seeking to punish the Taliban, Afghanistan's then rulers, for 
harbouring Osama, the Security Council voted a year ago to require 
all UN members to freeze any funds or financial assets under their 
control belonging to Osama or any group linked to him.

The 15-nation council asked the committee to designate which groups 
and individuals should be covered by the vote. US blames Osama and 
Al Qaeda for the Sept 11 suicide attacks on the United States that 
killed more than 3,000 people. The United Nations has been working 
closely with the United States in a campaign to cut off the funding 
of suspected "terrorist" organizations.

Washington announced that it was blocking the assets of Ummah 
Tameer-i-Nau and the three Pakistani nationals - UTN founder Sultan 
Bashir-Ud-Din Mahmood, nuclear fuels expert Abdul Majeed, and 
industrialist S.M. Tufail. Announcement by the UN sanctions 
committee tracks the US move. Mahmood was formerly the director for 
nuclear power at the Pakistani Atomic Energy Commission, and Majeed 
was a former high- ranking commission official.

An SBP spokesman said the State Bank had asked banks and NBFIs to 
furnish within a week the details of the assets of the two groups. 
Senior bankers said the SBP had also asked them to identify the

ISLAMABAD, Dec 27: President Gen Pervez Musharraf met a delegation 
of 39 Ulema from all over the country and took them into confidence 
over the situation developing on the eastern borders. President 
Musharraf also shared with the delegation the measures being taken 
by the government to streamline the Madaris (religious schools) in 
the country.

The president said that the government was not planing any 
crackdown on the Madaris. He said that the government would not 
impose anything on the religious schools but encourage and support 
those willing to introduce subjects like English, mathematics, 
science and geography in their syllabus, Dr Khalid Raza of Zakori 
Sharif later told Dawn.

Dr Raza, who was present at the meeting, said that the religious 
leaders subscribed to the official view that the Indian government 
was responsible for the escalation of tension, which was simply to 
divert the Indian public's attention from domestic problems.

BEIJING, Dec 24: President Pervez Musharraf vowed to crack down on 
groups, accused of attacking the Indian parliament provided the 
evidence was found. "Yes, if we find evidence of it, we would like 
to move against them," Gen Musharraf said in response to 
journalists' questions in southern Guangzhou city of Guangdong 
province.

"We are already taking measures to move against all groups that are 
involved in any form of terrorism anywhere in the world," he said 
in television footage broadcast on CNN. Addressing the first-ever 
conference on promotion of trade and investment between China and 
Pakistan, he said: Gen Musharraf said that Pakistan felt secure and 
strong in the region because of Chinese assistance in the defence 
sector.

"We are lucky to have Chinese assistance in the defence sector," he 
said. The conference was attended by 250 prominent Chinese 
businessmen and members of a 40-strong Pakistan trade delegation. 
It was aimed at exploring new avenues of economic cooperation 
between the two nations and increasing volume of their bilateral 
trade.

The president assured the Chinese business community that the 
economic and political restructuring and reforms introduced by his 
government would remain unchanged, even after the election due next 
year. "The foreign investment would get legal cover," he added.

The law and order situation in the country is quite satisfactory 
and conducive to business activities, he said, adding that a number 
of incentives had been provided to foreigners to ensure they got 
best possible return on their investment.

Gen Musharraf described his visit to China as "highly successful". 
The leadership of the two countries had decided to strengthen their 
economic partnership and open a new chapter in their relations, he 
added. It has been decided to transform our political and strategic 
interaction into economic collaboration, the president said. He 
said Pakistan would learn from the experiences of Chinese in socio-
economic development. -Agencies

<a name="reje">Pakistan rejects charges against HC staffer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 24: Pakistan categorically rejected Indian 
allegations against Mohammad Sharif Khan, a staffer of the Pakistan 
High Commission in New Delhi. A statement issued by the Foreign 
Office strongly refuted the allegations against Mr Sharif that he 
was involved in procurement of sensitive documents relating to 
defense, atomic energy, nuclear research, ship design and security 
of the Indian parliament.

"These absurd Indian allegations represent yet another desperate 
attempt to implicate Pakistan in the Dec 13 terrorist attack on the 
Indian Parliament" the statement said. It may be recalled that Mr 
Sharif was abducted by Indian intelligence operatives on Dec 22 
while shopping in Karol Bagh market of New Delhi. Later, the Indian 
officials subjected Mr Sharif to severe beating and torture during 
his five-hour illegal detention.

The Government of Pakistan lodged a strong protest with India for 
the brutal treatment meted out to its official in Indian capital 
and asked for a thorough investigation into the incident. 
Pakistan's deputy high commissioner in New Delhi was summoned to 
the ministry of external affairs and informed about the Indian 
government's decision to declare Mr Sharif as persona non grata.

Accordingly, Mr Sharif has been asked to leave India within seven 
days. The deputy high commissioner rejected the baseless and 
concocted Indian allegations against the Pakistani official, the 
statement concluded.

ISLAMABAD, Dec 23: Pakistan condemned the illegal detention and 
torture of Mohammad Sharif Khan, a staff member of Pakistani High 
Commission in New Delhi, by the intelligence operatives of the 
Indian government.

In a statement, a foreign office spokesman said Mr Sharif was 
shopping in a New Delhi market when he was kidnapped at 5.30pm. 
During the interrogation, he was stripped naked, severely beaten up 
and tortured, resulting in visible and internal injuries, which 
were also confirmed in the medical report.

Mr Khan was released after five hours, only when his signature had 
been taken under duress on a statement acknowledging involvement in 
espionage. The foreign office had lodged a strong protest with the 
Indian High Commission in Islamabad over this "reprehensible, 
provocative and unacceptable action" on the part of the Indian 
government.

The government of India has been asked to conduct a thorough 
investigation into the incident and take appropriate action against 
the culprits.

Earlier, the High Commission of Pakistan in New Delhi had also 
lodged a protest with the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. The 
government of Pakistan, he said, would like to remind the Indian 
government of its obligations under the Vienna Convention on 
diplomatic relations and the bilateral code of conduct for the 
treatment of diplomatic/consular personnel agreed between Pakistan 
and India in 1992.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Dec 23: If Taliban leader Mulla Omar and Osama bin 
Laden are captured, they will be handed over to international 
justice but could also be tried in Afghanistan. An indication to 
this effect was given by the Chairman of the Afghan interim 
administration, Hamid Karzai, in an interview with CNN, a day after 
he assumed office in Kabul.

"We will deliver him to international justice. We will deliver him 
to the United States," Mr Karzai said when asked how his 
administration would deal with Osama bin Laden if he was found.

On Mulla Omar, about whose whereabouts some information was 
received "a couple of days ago", Mr Karzai said the Taliban leader 
was responsible for killing thousands of Afghans and for bringing 
suffering and terrorism to Afghanistan. He would be tried in 
Afghanistan and if there was a case against him internationally, 
"we will deliver him there also".

Mr Karzai spoke quietly, without rhetoric, and came across in the 
interview as a serious, sober person. He said he had no precise 
information about Mulla Omar, but some indications were received 
two days ago. These were being followed.

Asked whether he agreed with Gen Musharraf's assessment that Osama 
bin Laden might have been killed in the US bombing of Tora Bora, Mr 
Karzai said he had no information on this. If Osama bin Laden was 
dead, that would be good news because a "menace will no longer be 
there".

ISLAMABAD, Dec 24: The spokesman for the US-led coalition indicated 
that Osama bin Laden might have been killed in the intense bombing 
of Tora Bora. "Yes it is quite possible that he might have been 
killed," Ambassador Kenton Keith told a regular briefing, adding 
the coalition planes had carried out extensive bombing in the area 
where Osama had been last sighted.

The spokesman was asked to comment on the statement by President 
Gen Pervez Musharraf, made during his visit to China, that Osama 
might have been killed. "We have no specific information on that," 
he said, but added that it would not be surprising if Osama had 
been killed in the bombing. The spokesman ruled out the possibility 
of some Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters having fled to Kashmir. Asked 
whether the coalition was satisfied with the steps taken by 
Pakistan, he said, "coalition is extremely satisfied with what 
Pakistan has done."

In reply to a question whether the coalition had monitored any 
shifting of Pakistani troops from Afghan borders to Indian border, 
he said they had observed no lessening in the commitment of 
Pakistan government to sealing off the Afghan border. Answering a 
question whether the hunt for Osama and Mulla Omar were still on, 
he said the search was still going on.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 27: Asif Zardari was formally arrested in another 
corruption case, thwarting his attempts to come out of jail even 
after obtaining bail in thirteen cases. The arrest was formally 
made when Asif Zardari was taken to the court of Judge Shakhi 
Hussain Bukhari whose court was specially opened. All the 
accountability courts are closed till Jan 2.

A PPP leader said that filing of fresh reference by the NAB after 
over five years against Asif Zardari only showed frustration of the 
military regime. The AC gave twelve days' remand of Zardari to the 
NAB authorities in a latest reference involving alleged evasion of 
duties in the import of BMW car by an alleged front man.

According to the NAB, Asif Zardari is charged with fraudulent 
import of a bullet-proof BMW car. He allegedly kept the car in his 
use but it remained in the name of a fictitious person. Talking to 
journalists after his formal arrest, Zardari said he was first 
arrested on charges of keeping 70 mound of gold. Then he was 
accused of amassing US $2 billion. "Now they have come to lakhs, 
and one day they would go to hundreds," he said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 26: The release orders of Asif Ali Zardari who has 
been granted bail in all cases against him, were issued by the 
courts after surety bonds were furnished in the last three cases on 
his behalf.

Two surety bonds, each in the sum of Rs1 million, were furnished 
for his release in the Mir Murtaza Bhutto murder case and another 
two, each in the sum of Rs 25,000, in two separate cases, both 
pertaining to alleged suicide attempt by Mr Zardari were also 
furnished.

A session court of the district East issued the release orders of 
Asif Ali Zardari in the Mir Murtaza Bhutto case, and a judicial 
magistrate of district South ordered his release in the suicide 
attempt case.

According to Farooq Naek, one of the counsel for the husband of the 
former prime minister, his client should be released as he has been 
granted bail in all cases against him. There are 13 cases against 
Mr Zardari, who was arrested on Nov 5, 1996, at the Punjab Governor 
House, following the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto government by the 
then president, Farooq Leghari.

His counsel said if his client was arrested in any old reference, 
filed during the Nawaz government, it would be malafide and 
political victimization to obstruct the release of Mr Zardari. Asif 
Zardari, who was initially detained under the Maintenance of Public 
Order, was first arrested in the Murtaza Bhutto murder case in 
November 1996, after the high court set aside his detention under 
MPO.

Later, he was charge-sheeted in the container case, Justice Nizam 
murder case, attempt to commit suicide case, Alam Baloch murder 
case, SGC reference, ARY Gold reference, tractor reference, Sajjad 
Ali murder case and Polo Ground reference.

His counsel told Dawn that he had been granted bail in as many as 
10 cases and in three cases he was not arrested. Mr Zardari was 
booked in 11 cases during the Nawaz Sharif government. He was 
booked in the Polo Ground reference and indicted in the Sajjad Ali 
murder case after the dismissal of the Nawaz government. 

Munawwar Soharwardi, a leader of the Pakistan People's Party, told 
Dawn that the release of Asif Zardari was expected very shortly as 
the surety bonds of the bails, obtained in all cases, had 
accordingly been furnished. "We have fulfilled all constitutional 
and legal requirements for the release of our leader," he said.

<a name="newd">New Delhi planning tougher actions </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Dec 22: India described its move to recall High 
Commissioner Vijay Nambiar from Islamabad as only the first step in 
a series of penal moves it planned against Pakistan, and officials 
said these could include the scrapping of the Indus Water Treaty 
and suspension of overflight facilities to Pakistani civilian 
planes.

Saying that Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee had hinted at harsh 
measures against Pakistan in parliament recently, Home Minister Lal 
Krishan Advani told a TV channel: "Recalling the envoy was only the 
first in a series of steps we propose to take in this matter."

He was quoted by The Hindustan Times as explaining the decision to 
recall Nambiar thus: "We said all options were open and we weighed 
the situation, took public perception into account and then took 
the decision, after the (cabinet committee on security) was briefed 
by the service chiefs and our intelligence agencies... All members 
were unanimous that Pakistan had to pay the price."

Interestingly US Ambassador Robert Blackwill has been quoted as 
telling some BJP MPs at a dinner he hosted for them that they 
should follow Vajpayee's approach to the crisis, understood to be a 
moderate in the otherwise hawkish BJP.

Advani denied that the government was divided. "We had to take 
action, which we have done. I want to make it clear that there are 
no hawks or doves in the government. We are all one. This constant 
refrain of differences between Atalji and me is simply not true," 
he told The Hindustan Times. Pro-government defence analyst Brahma 
Chellaney was among several advocates of harsh penalties on 
Pakistan.

He wrote in the Hindustan Times: "India's first actions amount to 
nothing more than a slap on the Pakistani wrist, but the signal 
they send out internationally is unmistakable: New Delhi means 
business. A further downgrading of diplomatic relations is likely."

India's graduated approach, through a measured exercize of options, 
seeks to penalize Pakistan not through immediate application of 
force but through controlled non-military retribution in the form 
of gradual, modulated steps up the punishment ladder, analysts 
said.

Such is the degree of hostility towards Pakistan that no party 
barring the Left Front has come out to advocate moderation. BJP 
spokesman J.P. Mathur even slammed Islamabad's decision to keep its 
high commissioner in Delhi as an example of "ungraceful diplomacy." 
Communist Party of India and two other left groups said the 
government had taken decision without informing the opposition, a 
move that could recoil on its diplomatically.

Foreign Secretary S.K. Singh, who has been an envoy to Pakistan, 
said Vajpayee was opposed to the idea of hot pursuit of militants 
inside Pakistan. But, he added: "He has other options in mind. For 
instance, ending the Indus Valley Water Treaty and starving Sindh 
and Punjab, scaling down of the mission," Singh said. The Indus 
Water Treaty of 1960 governs the distribution of water from the 
Indus river and its tributaries between India and Pakistan.

"And when Pakistan has digested this, we can stop over flights. We 
don't need their airspace, they need ours," Singh was quoted by the 
newspapertoday online daily as saying. There was also a suggestion 
that India take the case of the terrorist assault on the Parliament 
House to the United Nations.

"India will try to prepare a watertight case against Pakistan's 
involvement and take it to the United Nations," said Ajai Sahni, 
executive director of the New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict 
Management, a counter-terrorism research body. "If the case is 
admitted in the United Nations, under the anti-terrorism Resolution 
1373, Pakistan will be bound to follow the UN's instructions. 
Delegitimizing terrorism would be India's top priority," he said.

The final word on the current tense standoff went to Foreign 
Minister Jaswant Singh who told reporters in Kabul that India's 
patience was not infinite. He described the decision to withdraw 
Nambiar as a signal to Pakistan to recognize the enormity of the 
crime.

"The step was only a signal, a message to Pakistan so that it 
recognizes the enormity of the situation," Singh said when asked 
about New Delhi's decision to recall Nambiar. "India has been 
patient and waiting since Dec 13 for some kind of recognition from 
the Pakistan government about the enormity of the situation. 
Nothing of that sort came. 

The issue was deliberated by the Cabinet Committee on Security 
(CCS) at great lengths and it was decided to pull out India's High 
Commissioner to Pakistan," Singh said. He ducked a question when 
asked whether India was considering a military option to deal with 
the situation saying "I am not in Kabul to discuss such options."

Meanwhile the Press Trust of India reported intensified 
surveillance by the security forces along the border with Pakistan.

"We have launched intensified surveillance and monitoring 
operations in different areas of Kargil, Jammu, Poonch and Kashmir 
sectors in order to tackle any type of situation emerging on the 
border, particularly in Jammu-Poonch Sector," said a PTI report 
from Jammu, quoting sources. Even in remote areas the security 
apparatus has been beefed. According to Border Security Force 
sources, the Army is taking up positions along the border in 
Rajasthan too, in a bid to thwart any adventure by Pakistan, even 
as BSF jawans are keeping a close watch on the movements of 
Pakistan Rangers across the border.

Cemented bunkers on the east bank of the Ganga Canal in Rajasthan, 
constructed before the 1971 Indo-Pakistan war, have been cleaned up 
and troops have taken up positions. 

Troop movement was also observed in many of the villages in the 
state as the Air Force installed mobile radars at several places. 
According to a PTI report, the Ganganagar district has witnessing 
enhanced movements of defence goods for the last three days.

ISLAMABAD, Dec 24: The government confirmed that former Taliban 
ambassador to Islamabad, Abdul Salam Zaeef, had requested political 
asylum in Pakistan. "We have received an application from Mr Zaeef 
for asylum and we will process it," a foreign ministry official 
told AFP. He said the application would be processed before a final 
decision was taken.

"It has not been rejected, we will process it before taking any 
decision," the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said. 
Mr Zaeef told AFP he was seeking asylum in Pakistan but he did not 
elaborate. Sources close to Zaeef said that, in his application, he 
had said "the situation in Afghanistan is not conducive" for his 
return.

"There is no more Taliban government and until the situation in 
Afghanistan returns to normal, I should be allowed to stay in 
Pakistan," he wrote in his asylum plea, they said. Zaeef, who has 
his home and family in Islamabad, said he was waiting for a 
response to his request. -AFP

<a name="fbig">FBI grills Al-Qaeda detainees in Kohat</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Abdul Sami Paracha

KOHAT, Dec 28: A six-member FBI team, assisted by top Pakistan 
Military Intelligence officials, is interrogating 139 Al-Qaeda men 
detained at the central prison, Kohat, to give its findings to 
their headquarters in the US for a final action against terrorist 
organizations all over the world, Dawn learnt from one of the 
interrogators.

The US understands that this information would be the only first-
hand report regarding the activities and members of the Al-Qaeda in 
other countries of the world. "They (the Al-Qaeda men) will be the 
only source to tell the Americans what plans Osama bin Laden had in 
his mind before and after the Sept 11 attacks," the source confided 
to Dawn on the condition of anonymity.

So far they had been able only to know that Osama was alive, and 
efforts were under way to get more information from them. The 
source further said that the US authorities were very much 
satisfied with the progress so far made in this connection and 
appreciated the role of Pakistan in its war against terrorism.

The military officials have hired the services of an Arabic-
speaking man who translates the conversation between the FBI men 
and the Arab captives, including two French Muslims.

Earlier, a team from Islamabad had interviewed all the Al-Qaeda men 
and prepared a report and another report is being prepared by 
another agency to tally both of them before a final assessment.

The source quoted the Al-Qaeda men as telling the FBI team that 
Osama and Mulla Omar were still alive, inside Afghanistan and safe. 
"Till their (Al-Qaeda men's) arrest last week both (Osama and Omar) 
were alive and survived the heavy US bombing in the Tora Bora 
area," the Al-Qaeda men said. They also told the FBI team that 
there were still 6000 to 7000 Al-Qaeda men inside Afghanistan or 
astride the long unmanned border.

The source further said that all Al-Qaeda men would be sent to 
their native countries for trial once the FBI got the required 
information about their links to the Sept 11 attacks. He said that 
Pakistan was not in a position to conduct trial of such a large 
number of foreign terrorists involved in crimes outside Pakistan.

The source said that some of the Al-Qaeda terrorists had sneaked 
into Pakistan in small groups and were sheltering inside the tribal 
territory, protected by some tribesmen. He further said that 
efforts were under way to negotiate their handing over to the 
military authorities by the tribal elders but the terms and 
conditions had not been finalized yet. He hoped that a deal would 
soon be finalized.

The Kohat airbase and the central prison had been cordoned off by 
Pakistan Army Special Services Group commandos and the security of 
the FBI team is being personally supervised by the head of the SSG, 
Brigadier Haroon.

The FBI team had also hired the services of a handful of 
intelligence officers from the Arab countries who are assisting 
them in identifying the Al-Qaeda men and their connections with the 
hard-liners and terrorist organizations operating inside their 
countries.

<a name="trib">Tribal leader warns of war over US raids</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 23: A tribal leader in eastern Afghanistan 
threatened to launch a war against Afghan Interim Setup Chairman 
Hamid Karzai if US jets launched another attack on his area, Afghan 
Islamic Press reported. The warning from Gulab Din, head of the 
Zadran tribe in the Paktia province, came as the US government 
struggled to shake off accusations that its jets had attacked a 
convoy taking tribal elders and other local officials to Karzai's 
inauguration in Kabul.

According to AIP, 65 people were killed in the attack on the convoy 
near the town of Khost. Senior US officials have insisted Al-Qaeda 
and Taliban leaders were in the convoy. Din said the US attacks had 
killed only civilians, and warned: "If the US launches similar 
tyrannical attacks again, we will launch an armed struggle against 
Hamid Karzai's government."

He accused the head of the Khost administration, Bacha Khan, of 
supplying wrong information to US forces and causing the attack on 
the convoy. "Bacha Khan is giving wrong information to the 
Americans. If he does it again, we will wage an armed struggle 
against him also." The tribal leader said there were no Taliban or 
Al-Qaeda fighters in the convoy.

AIP quoted a wounded Afghan, Mazali, as saying that seven members 
of his family had been killed in the bombing. At least 14 houses in 
his village of Pakhari had been razed in the US attacks in which 
women and children had also died, he said. "We will start a Jihad 
against Karzai if US jets repeated such attacks."

Gen Tommy Franks, commander of US forces in Afghanistan, insisted 
that US warplanes had been fired on before attacking the convoy. 
"Friendly forces don't fire surface-to-air missiles at you", he 
said in Kabul just before the inauguration of the interim 
government.

"We believe it was a bad convoy. We have reason to believe it was a 
good target. Right now we have people on the ground investigating 
but we are convinced it was a good target." -AFP

<a name="12di">12 die as minibus falls off bridge</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 23: Twelve people died and 14 others suffered 
injuries, four of them seriously, when a recklessly driven minibus, 
they were travelling in, fell off the Malir bridge. Eyewitnesses 
said the driver was carelessly driving the minibus in a zigzag 
motion. The minibus went out of his control when he tried to save 
two motorcycles, moving ahead of the minibus on the bridge, and the 
minibus fell off breaking the railing of the bridge.

The dead and injured were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical 
Centre by Edhi ambulances where seven dead were identified as 
Sajan, Mohammad Bakhtawar Khan, Abdul Sattar, Abdur Rahim, Mohammad 
Yusuf, Sher Mohammad and Habibur Rehman. Four others remained 
unidentified. Seriously injured Rashid Hussain was moved to a 
private hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

Those injured were identified as Tariq, 30; Fawad, 30; driver 
Islamuddin, 30; Fayyaz, 35; Rambil, 40; Sakina, 35; Ashraf, 35; 
Abdul Kaleem, 40; Mehboob, 8; and the names of five could not be 
ascertained.

An injured passenger, Ashraf, who got to the ill-fated minibus at 
Daud Chowrangi and witnessed the scene which led to the gory 
incident, said: "The minibus was moving fast from Qaudiabad to 
Sohrab Goth when a truck appeared from the opposite side overtaking 
a vehicle moving ahead of it. The minibus driver took the vehicle 
on his extreme left where two motorcycles were moving ahead of the 
minibus. The driver tried to halt the minibus with a screech of 
brakes but he lost his control and then we flew into the air and 
landed with a bang. Then I don't know what happened next."

Another injured, Tariq, a labourer and resident of Future Colony, 
who got into the minibus at Daud Chowrangi for Gulshan-i- Iqbal, 
said: "The driver of the minibus was driving fast in a zigzag 
movement overtaking the vehicles. He tried to save two motorcycles, 
travelling ahead of the minibus on Malir bridge when he lost his 
control over the steering and I heard a bang. What came next, I 
don't know as I was not in my senses."

The conductor of ill-fated minibus of route D-7 (PE-0088), 16-year-
old Hikmat Ali said it was his first day on the minibus. He could 
not speak further as he was in a semi-conscious state. The minibus 
driver Islamuddin was not in a state of uttering any statement as 
he was badly injured.

Ali and Hasan, labourers at a nearby hydrant beneath the Malir 
Bridge told Dawn that they were present at the hydrant when they 
heard a bang and saw the minibus falling from the bridge. The 
minibus fell upside down on the rough and rocky surface. The 
passengers were crying and yelling for help.

Ali said: "I and my colleague tied the minibus with hard ropes and 
dragged it by two trucks to turn it around. In the meantime, Edhi 
ambulances reached the spot."

He said the people from adjoining areas came to rescue the 
passengers. As the spot was inaccessible for vehicles, the rescue 
workers took the injured and bodies to the ambulances parked near 
the riverbed.

A visit to the spot showed that the vehicular traffic was jammed 
and only two traffic policemen were controlling the traffic 
movement on the bridge. The people on the spot said a police mobile 
of Malir City police station came to inspect the scene and went 
away thereafter. Since, there was no police mobile.

The people were peeping into the wreckage of the minibus, the seats 
of which were blood stained and the belongings of the passengers 
were littered in and around.

At the JPMC, the doctors at the hospital said that emergency was 
declared at the hospital and injured were being provided with 
prompt treatment. The medicolegal officials were also performing 
postmortems on the bodies so that their relatives could take the 
bodies without any delay.

However, the doctors at the hospital complained that the relevant 
police station sent only two police officials to complete the legal 
formalities and paper work. The two officials were not adequate to 
complete the formalities without delay.

The doctors said the police officials took hours to complete the 
legal formalities, which had irritated the relatives of the dead as 
they could not take the bodies away without the permission of the 
police officials.

<a name="perm">Permission sought to operate Kanupp beyond design life</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 27: The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) has 
submitted an application to the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory 
Authority (PNRA) to seek permission to operate the Karachi Nuclear 
Power Plant(Kanupp) beyond its design life. The Kanupp, being 
operated by the PAEC, is the first power plant of Pakistan, which 
is completing its design life in October 2002.

An official announcement says that the Kanupp has unblemished 
record of 30 years of safe operation recognized by different safety 
reviews carried out by the national regulatory authority and a 
number of international organizations including the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEC).

The statement said that the PAEC, on the basis of the operating 
experience, had initiated different projects in the late eighties 
to combat aging problems and for safety upgrades of the plant. The 
objective of these projects was to ensure the safe operation of the 
plant during its design life and to assess if it could be operated 
safely beyond its design life.

Now the Kanupp, after the extension application, was required to 
fulfil the PNRA requirements for re-licensing like submission of 
detailed documentation and safety evaluation.

The announcement said that normally it took about three years to 
complete the regulatory review, but PNRA was likely to carry out 
the review before October 2002, depending upon the timely 
submissions by the Kanupp/PAEC.

The PNRA will also conduct inspections for the verification of the 
implementation work to the acceptable standards for re- licensing 
of the plant. Special adviser to the president on strategic studies 
Dr Ishfaq Ahmad in his lecture on sustainable development and 
nuclear technology had recently stated that through the indigenous 
efforts the design life of the Kanupp could be extended to another 
20 years.

<a name="adbr">ADB releases $150m loan for reforms </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 27: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said it had 
released 150 million dollars in loans to Pakistan to fund judicial 
and police reforms, and the restructuring of trade and industry.

The loans will support the government's efforts to strengthen legal 
protection for the poor and other vulnerable groups and to 
liberalize and modernize the trade and industry sectors, the ADB 
said in a statement. A $100 million loan under the Access to 
Justice Program is the first installment of $350 million in funding 
approved by the bank last week.

"The Access to Justice Program will enable the poor to exercise 
their rights guaranteed under the law and to protect their property 
from being taken away by the bureaucratic or political elite," it 
said.

"It will also provide, through a legal empowerment fund, free legal 
advice and advocacy for the poor by civil society groups, including 
lawyers and NGOs." The ADB said the program would strengthen the 
rule of law by providing resources to reform the judiciary and the 
police.-AFP

<a name="situ">Situation ideal for investment: Musharraf</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 28: President General Pervez Musharraf has asked the 
investors and business community to take full advantage of the 
prevailing situation and the most conducive environment for 
investment in Pakistan since many years.

"We have provide you the facilities, right environment and support 
of international community, now it is up to you to take advantage 
of the situation," the President said while chairing the 9th 
meeting of Economic Advisory Board. "You have now to take 
initiatives for investment which would certainly be a encouraging 
signal to the foreign investors and they would also invest here, " 
Gen Musharraf said.

Your investment, the president said would create new job 
opportunities and also boost the production and exports as well. 
"The European Union's incentive for Pakistani exporters could bear 
fruit only when you will take steps in the right direction."

He said Pakistan could earn one billion dollars if we succeed in 
properly exploring the textile market in Europe as the EU has 
already enhanced our quota by 15 per cent and reduced the import 
duty on our products.

The president told the businessmen that Gwadar Port and Coastal 
High way would be functional in the next 36 months and you should 
start planning now where you are going to establish industry in 
that area.

He also assured the private sector that the irritants, which do 
exist at the federal and provincial levels, will be addressed and 
even better environment for investment will be created in the 
country.

President Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industries Iftikhar 
Malik said that the whole business community in Pakistan fully 
supports the policies of the government and the decision taken by 
the president on Afghanistan and in relation to India.

He said he is going to Katmandu to attend the SAARC conference 
where he would meet the Presidents of the Chambers of all the SAARC 
countries. "We will work as pressure group so that India should de-
escalate the tension. If India would not pay heed to our demands we 
would also not accept Most Favoured Nation status for India."-APP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Dec 26: The government has decided to establish Small 
and Medium Enterprise (SME) Bank with an initial capital of one 
billion rupees to offer loans to small and medium enterprises.

"This new SME bank will be inaugurated on Jan I to arrange 
considerable loans for our small and medium enterprises in order to 
further strengthen pace of industrialisation in the country," said 
Minister for Finance Shaukat Aziz. Talking to Dawn, he said that 
Small Business Finance Corporation (SBFC) and Regional Development 
Finance Corporation (RDFC) were being merged into one organization 
to be called SME Bank.

He said that SME Bank would work like Micro Finance Bank and would 
be run by highly competent professionals, a number of whom had just 
been recruited from the private sector. "We are making a powerful 
Board of the SME Bank so that it could function without any outside 
interference," the Finance Minister said. He said the Board would 
be totally independent to take vital decisions to promote SMEs in 
all the four provinces.

"And after having streamlined on modern lines the SME Bank will be 
privatized," Mr Aziz said, adding that the government would ensure 
that the new bank should offer loans to deserving small and medium 
enterprises.

<a name="ksee">KSE escapes collapse thanks to circuit breaker</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 24: The fears of war with India halted the last week's 
upward drive amid panic selling but the presence of circuit breaker 
forestalled the market's possible collapse after the KSE index 
plunged by 6 per cent or 81 points at 1,323.05.

Many leading brokers claim the market should have collapsed if the 
KSE authorities had not applied the rule of circuit breaker under 
which a fall or rise beyond Rs.1.50 in a single session is not 
allowed to protect the interest of small investors as well as 
market manipulation by the "big ones".

However, this was not the largest single-session fall as it has 
dropped more than once in late 90s above 100 points, the largest 
being 129 points on various negative news including dismissal of 
elected prime ministers and no confidence moves against them.

"There were sellers all around but not many buyers allowing the 
prices to drop like nine pins across the board under the lead of 
heavily-capitalised shares such as PTCL, Hub-Power, PSO and ICI 
Pakistan, having a formidable weightage in the index," stock 
analysts at the W.E.Financial Services said.

An idea of war fears followed by massive panic-selling on the local 
market may well be had from the fact that it battered the index by 
81 points, while its Indian counterpart Bombay Stock Exchange index 
showed only a modest decline of 12 points, they added.

"Unlike the previous market destabilisers, the money did not 
outflow to dollar, although it ruled strong on some other counts 
and so did gold," brokers said. It was in this background that the 
broader market showed widespread losses, while the pivotal, notably 
the index shares received massive battering under the lead of 
leading base shares, the largest decline of Rs.2.70 and 6.35 being 
in ICI Pakistan and PSO respectively.

Minus signs dominated the list under the lead of energy and some 
foreign shares under the lead of PSO, Shell Pakistan, Al-Ghazi 
Tractors, BOC Pakistan, Engro Chemical, Adamjee Insurance, Fauji 
Fertilizer and Glaxo-Wellcome Pakistan, off Rs.2.20 to 8.55, 
largest decline being in Shell Pakistan.

But the largest decline of Rs.20 was recorded in Grays of Cambridge 
followed by Lever Brothers, down Rs.11.00. All other leading shares 
also fell in unison. Among the 13 gainers, Dewan Mushtaq Textiles, 
Abbas Engineering and Wah Noble Chemical were leading, up by one 
rupee to Rs.1.38, while others rose fractionally.

Trading volume did not keep pace with the mounting selling offers 
in the absence of buyers and rose modestly to 89m shares as losers 
forced a strong lead over the gainers at 134 to 13, with 41 holding 
on to the last levels.

PTCL topped the list of most actives, off Rs.1.50 at Rs.14.65 on 
32m shares followed by Hub-Power, lower Rs.1.45 at Rs.16.95 on 30m 
shares, PSO, sharply lower by Rs.6.35 at Rs.95 on 6m shares, Sui 
Northern Gas, off Rs.1.15 at Rs.8.80 on 4m shares and ICI Pakistan, 
down Rs.2.70 at Rs.39.35 on 3m shares.

Other actives were led by Engro Chemical, off Rs.4.25 on 2.197m 
shares, MCB, lower Rs.1.70 on 1,737m shares, Fauji Fertilizer, easy 
Rs.2.20 on 1.641m shares, FFC Jordan Fertilizer, lower 55 paisa on 
1.273m shares and Nishat Mills, down Rs.1.50 on 1.205m shares.

FUTURE CONTRACTS: Speculative issues on the forward counter also 
received massive battering in line with steep decline in their 
ready counterparts and finished at their career-lowest levels on 
persistent war-related selling.

The biggest fall of Rs.5.35 to Rs.6 was recorded in PSO, both 
settlements at Rs.95.80 and 96 on 0.116 and 0.117m shares followed 
by ICI Pakistan and Engro Chemical, off Rs.2.90 and 4.20 to 4.30 at 
Rs.40, 54 and 53.20 for both the contracts respectively.

The highest volume of 2.335m shares was noted in PTCL at Rs.14.72, 
off Rs.1.43 and 1.50 for both settlements followed by Hub-Power, 
easy Rs.1.49 at Rs.16.91 on 1.490m shares.

DEFAULTER COMPANIES: Allied Motors was the only share, which came 
in for trading and fell by 30 paisa at Rs.3 on 4,000 shares.

<a name="thee">The enemy of ignorance</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

What fun! The day after tomorrow we celebrate the official birthday 
of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, founder and maker of Pakistan. With great 
foresight, the man chose the date to be the same as that celebrated 
world-wide as being the day of the birth of the Second in Trinity, 
December 25th.

Guns will be fired, flags unfurled and hoisted, the people will 
flock to his Mazar to listen to today's 'high-ups' tell them what 
was that Jinnah visualized for the country he made for them. This 
will, of course, conform to the narrow expedient governmental 
vision.

However, luckily this time around it may not be so dire, as a few 
of those who now lead have read and digested what Jinnah expounded 
on February 19 1948: "But make no mistake, Pakistan is not a 
theocracy or anything like it. Islam demands from us the tolerance 
of other creeds and we welcome in closest association with us all 
those who of whatever creed are themselves willing and ready to 
play their part as true and loyal citizens of Pakistan."

A few days later, he reiterated: "In any case, Pakistan is not 
going to be a theocratic state to be ruled by priests with a divine 
mission. We have many non-Muslims - Hindus, Christians and Parsis. 
They are all Pakistanis. They will enjoy the same rights and 
privileges as any other citizens and will play their rightful part 
in the affairs of Pakistan."

There is no one alive who can recount today Jinnah's speech to the 
Imperial Legislative Council in April 1912, and one can be pretty 
sure that few have even read it. In the collection of Jinnah's 
speeches and writings between the years 1912 and 1917, can be found 
what he said in support of Gopal Krishna Gokhale's Elementary 
Education Bill.

Jinnah opened up by expressing his regrets that although there were 
certain of his colleagues who opposed the bill, no council member 
could possibly deny its paramount importance, and that even those 
opposing it were bound to admit the fact that it had the support of 
the great majority of their countrymen, Hindus and Muslims alike.

He praised Gokhale for the masterly way in which he had dealt with 
the question of elementary education and for the services he had 
rendered to the country, adding: "I only pray that India may have 
many more sons like him." To kill the enemy of ignorance, the 
gradual extension of the system that had existed for 150 years - 
the voluntary system principle - was no answer. He reproached the 
British for their neglect of elementary education.

For the 150 years they had ruled, they had dealt with education at 
a 'jog trot pace' which, if continued, as Gokhale's figures 
conclusively proved, it would take a further 175 years in order to 
get all school-going age children to school and 600 years to get 
all the girls to school. There could be no salvation for the masses 
unless the principle of compulsory education was introduced. This 
has been proven time and again, for in no country has elementary 
education become universal without compulsion.

Admittedly, as Sir Harcourt Butler, one opponent to the bill, had 
stated, India could not be compared to other countries of the world 
as in certain respects its conditions differed radically. But its 
people belonged to the same species, human beings and in that 
respect they resembled all other nations of the world. Conditions 
may well have been different and that is where the statesmen and 
the politicians came into play. It was up to them to meet those 
special conditions and provide the necessary safeguards.

Elementary education had nothing to do with the fact that India had 
many castes, many creeds and many languages, but provision had to 
be made for them. There was much force in the argument that there 
were not sufficient school buildings, nor sufficient teachers, but 
if the money was there schools could be built, and teachers trained 
and paid. The opponents who insisted that the money was not there 
were merely repeating the very, very old story. Jinnah's answer to 
them: "All I can say is this, find money ! Find money !! Find money 
!!! I appeal to the president, not as president but as the finance 
minister. I say, find money. If you say you have not got enough 
money, discover and tap new sources....."

The people were already taxed, yes, he admitted. And if the 
government imposed further taxes to fund the purpose and provisions 
of the bill, the government would be faced with a good deal of 
unpopularity. But so what? What they would be doing is benefiting 
the masses of the country to whom the government owed a greater 
duty than to anybody else. He appealed to the British to remove the 
reproach justly levelled against their rule - the neglect of 
elementary education. "It is the duty of every civilized government 
to educate the masses, and if you have to face unpopularity, if you 
have to face a certain amount of danger, face it boldly in the name 
of duty ..... You will have the whole educated public with you in 
the struggle on the battlefield."

Having dealt with the issue of the voluntary system versus 
compulsion, he moved on to the dangers cited - the political danger 
and the social danger. Others, Nawab Majid and Muhammad Shafi 
amongst them, had opposed the bill on the ground that were the 
people to be given education, it would breed socialism and 
agitators who would organize strikes. Ridiculous, said Jinnah, to 
equate education with sedition. Frank and independent criticism of 
the government was the duty of every member of the state and fair, 
free and independent criticisms of the acts of government could in 
no way constitute sedition. Was it in any way logical to say that a 
boy who could read and write would automatically become a political 
agitator?

Jinnah reminded the council members that it was they who knew the 
blessings of education, which the British government had given them 
- for the British were the first to open the eyes of the Indians to 
the importance of education. It was the British government, which 
had brought them up to the level where they were able to stand and 
deliberate upon the affairs of the nation and the country. He asked 
them, where would they all be but for education?

As for another fear of the feudals - that the people would become 
'too big for their boots', that they would not follow the 
occupations of their parents, that they would demand more rights, 
that they would agitate, that they would become socialists, was it 
the intention to keep millions and millions of people downtrodden 
merely out of fear that they may demand more rights? Were they to 
be kept in darkness and ignorance for all ages to come in case they 
stand up, after realizing that they do have certain rights, and ask 
for those rights? It was only those who were influenced by selfish 
reasons who were urging that universal elementary education was a 
mistake.

Jinnah was firm - there was neither a social nor a political 
danger. In fact, those in government would have more friends, and 
more intelligent friends, who would understand them better so that 
their work would be made easier. They would have fewer unscrupulous 
people to deal with - those who were then in a position to impose 
upon the ignorant and provoke them. Compulsory universal elementary 
education was not only in the greater interests of the country, he 
told his fellow members, it was imperative.

Now, let us think. Does Gokhale's bill and Jinnah's support still 
hold good today, particularly in the context of illiteracy in 
Pakistan? The answer: a glaring 'yes'. But how does one tackle the 
problem?

On December 8, 2001, in this newspaper of record was printed a news 
item. The good news is that contraception in Pakistan has increased 
from 5.5 per cent to 23.9 per cent. The bad news is that despite 
this, 5.3 million babies are born in the country each year. Of 
these, 270,000 die at birth. This works out to a birth rate of 
approximately 10 babies per minute who live and, if they are lucky, 
reach the school-going age. Can one of our pundits elaborate how we 
can educate all these children? Should the mullahs and maulvis not 
be told to preach the benefits of birth control and education in 
their mosques rather than bigotry and the furtherance of violence?

On a related plane, some more good news: Dr Syed Hussain Jafri, a 
secular progressive professor at the Aga Khan University, who holds 
the Chair of Islamic and Pakistan Studies of the Faculty of Health 
Sciences, has invited Professor Stanley Wolpert of UCLA, the 
historian and author of the best book yet written on Jinnah, to 
come to Karachi and address the growing and the grown at the Aga 
Khan University Auditorium on December 26. His subject: 'Quaid-i-
Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah's Vision of Pakistan'.

<a name="nati">National honour is not on the line</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

At times such as these cliches come in handy. Faced with threats 
from India we should sink our differences, close ranks and rally 
round the flag and the commander-in-chief. There will be time 
enough to indulge the luxury of scepticism when the crisis passes.

Precisely such an attitude took us into the folly of the 1965 war 
and the great tragedy of 1971 when half the country (or was it more 
than half?) just stood up and (and with no little Indian help) 
walked away. Patriotism is fine but any false notion of it should 
be no excuse for pulling down the shutters and refusing to think.

What is the nature of the present heightened state of tension with 
India? We are faced with no Indian diktat regarding any aspect of 
national sovereignty. India, considering the circumstances 
propitious, is putting pressure on us to close down the 'jihadi' 
outfits which have been waging war (or whatever) in occupied 
Kashmir.

For close on seven or eight years - that is, since 1994-95 when the 
Kashmir insurgency started being dominated by outside fighters - we 
could sustain this policy and get away with it. After September 11, 
and after our turnaround on the Taliban, it was for us to realize 
that the era of outside 'jihad' in Kashmir was over. What we failed 
to do on our own, we are being forced to do by the pressure of 
circumstances.

National honour is not on the line. Only an aspect of national 
adventurism is being called into question. What sensible nations 
cannot sustain, they discard. When Britain could no longer afford 
to keep its empire it made a graceful exit from its colonies. 
France held on to its colonies long after it had the strength or 
ability to do so. The result was defeat in Vietnam (Dien Bien Phu) 
and rivers of blood in Algeria. The analogy doe not quite fit but 
the conclusion is clear. Clinging to a prize that is slipping from 
one's grasp is no sign of cleverness.

What does 'Pakistan first' - the slogan raised by the Musharraf 
government in the first flush of its turnaround on Afghanistan - 
mean? If anything, it means that we should look to our own house 
and eschew foreign adventures.

If this piece of priceless wisdom was relevant to Afghanistan, why 
not to Kashmir? We have been involved in occupied Kashmir for long. 
The world has come to know this in part because we blew our own 
disguise. Organizations like the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-
Mushammad had a free run of the entire country, holding rallies and 
easily collecting funds and recruits. India has not invented the 
substance of the charges against the Lashkar or Jaish. It has 
merely used and exploited the evidence we ourselves had 
accumulated.

After all, since when were covert wars allowed to have an overt 
face? But since the great policy-masters of Pakistan - stretching 
from GHQ to ISI - allowed this to happen, they are the authors of 
their own misfortune.

Nor was this simply a question of our cover being blown. Our 
forward policy in Kashmir was already becoming unsustainable. After 
September 11 we should have done some fast thinking and clamped 
down on the 'jihadi' outfits ourselves without waiting for 
circumstances to catch up with us. But we let the moment pass and 
so, after Afghanistan, another turnaround is being forced on us.

Thank God for US help here too. By outlawing the Lashkar and Jaish 
it has made it easier for us to take action against these two 
organisations. From the US we can take anything. But from India 
nothing. And why should we? The only problem is we keep putting 
ourselves in untenable positions - as in 1965, in 1971 and as 
indeed during the Kargil affair in 1999. We say India is the great 
enemy. But if enmity be measured by injuries inflicted, we have 
harmed ourselves more than anything India could have done.

Maybe India is the incarnation of evil and harbours malevolent 
designs against us. But the answer to that is not to constantly 
decry its motives or intentions (Pakistan Television's favourite 
pastime) but to improve national performance to such an extent that 
we are beyond the effect of its evil eye.

As for the present crisis, how strangely flat-footed in it we have 
been. We failed to appreciate the gravity of the attack on the Lok 
Sabha and the outrage it triggered in India. Some of the initial 
statements made by some of our officials could have been avoided. 
And what occasion for President Musharraf to say that India was 
being "arrogant" in recalling its high commissioner from Islamabad? 
Strong words ill-suited to the situation.

Now the pressure is all from the Indian side while we are at the 
receiving end. Washington is trying to calm sub-continental nerves 
but it is being quite unambiguous in telling Pakistan to close down 
the machinery of Kashmiri 'jihad'. Once again it is we who are 
twisting in the wind.

But this is one twisting that should be seen as necessary penance 
for past folly. The most difficult operation in war is a graceful 
retreat. This in peacetime is what we are being called upon to 
execute: a graceful exit from our unsustainable posture in Kashmir. 
First Afghanistan, now Kashmir. Such are the hard lessons we are 
having to learn.

The talons we had spread in all directions we are being called upon 
to draw in. A good thing that this is taking place under the 
strategic umbrella of the US or else the pain would have been 
excruciating. But if this physical withdrawal is to mean anything 
it has to be accompanied by an ideological retraction in the army 
command and the intelligence agencies operating under its wings. 
The days of external adventurism are over. Time to look inwards at 
our domestic plate.

On top of any domestic agenda must come the re-education of the 
ISI. It must look to its essential task of gathering intelligence 
and countering foreign espionage and abandon politics and foreign 
policy, the two fields it has completely messed up. This is a tall 
order but one which must be fulfilled if the moves in Kashmir and 
Afghanistan are to make any sense.

Secondly, the army has to redefine its role in national life. Will 
it rule the roost and intervene at will in political matters or 
will it allow the political process to find its bearings over a 
period of time? True, politicians have made their mistakes and paid 
dearly for them. But it is the overbearing presence of the 
military, which has retarded and distorted the political process.

Today we find ourselves in a bizarre situation. The military cannot 
effectively manage national affairs on its own, all military 
strongmen having been disasters in one form or another. But 
repeated military interventions have turned politicians into 
pygmies, depriving them of the ability and confidence to shoulder 
national responsibilities. More than the waterlogging and salinity 
to hit our croplands, it is this desertification of politics which 
is our biggest problem.

These are funny priorities, you will say. On the horizon the danger 
of war threatens while here I am speaking of a political 
restoration. But the two are inter-linked. It is the death of the 
political process, now and previously, which has led to the 
militarization of Pakistan's foreign policy and the repeated 
reverses we have suffered over the years.

India's advantage lies not so much in numbers or size as in its 
democracy, and the consultative process that goes with it. We must 
overcome this advantage, not by raising further monuments to 
unrepresentative rule but by recognizing the separateness of the 
military and political spheres. Unless we get this right, we'll 
keep losing our way. It is not with any pleasure that a Pakistani 
recounts his nation's follies. Driving him is an overpowering sense 
of anger at the repeated spectacle of tiny coteries hijacking the 
nation's fortune. For their blunders the nation as a whole has then 
to pay the price.

There is nothing wrong with the soil or air of Pakistan. Or indeed 
with its people, who, apart from a tendency to suffer fools in high 
places, have their eyes in the right direction. It is simply a 
problem of leadership, which has cast shadows over a land that 
could easily be happy and prosperous.

<a name="recl">Reclaiming our faith</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

Not surprisingly, the man who attempted to blow up the American 
Airlines jet over the Atlantic last week has turned out to be a 
Muslim. According to Mr Abdul Haqq Baker, chairman of the Brixton 
mosque which was attended by Richard Reid, this young British 
subject had been converted to 'a less tolerant strand of Islam' by 
a jihadi group.

As I write this from London, newspapers are full of speculation 
about his motive, background and political connections. One thing 
is certain, and that is the fact that he attempted to bring down a 
plane together with its crew and passengers. Again one wonders what 
kind of rage drives relatively well-off young men to commit 
atrocities of this nature. For a Palestinian to commit suicide in 
an attempt to strike back against his country's occupiers and 
tormentors is more comprehensible as he has so few options. But for 
a Briton to be similarly driven raises questions about the nature 
of the Islam that is being taught to the younger generation.

Clearly, its political content far outweighs its spiritual element. 
The poetry and symbolism are marginalized as heavy emphasis is 
placed on jihad, martyrdom and florid descriptions of the joys that 
await a martyr in paradise. This indoctrination - it can hardly be 
called belief - has no place for love, tolerance and respect for 
other faiths. It is a bleak, monochromatic and joyless religion 
that is far removed from the Islam that was revealed by the 
Almighty.

But even the faith that is followed by the majority of Muslims 
around the world has given rise to certain problems that need to be 
examined and discussed. Specifically, we need to ask why Muslim 
societies have provided such barren soil for democracy. In a recent 
survey conducted by Freedom House, an independent monitor of 
political rights, it was found that over 75 per cent of 145 non-
Muslim countries are democracies to varying degrees. However, only 
11 out of the 47 nations that are predominantly Muslim can claim to 
be democracies. In actual fact, only one Muslim state is genuinely 
democratic, and that is Mali (Mali?!). After Mali come Bangladesh, 
Indonesia, Jordan, Kuwait (!), Turkey and Morocco.

Interestingly, out of the ten least free countries in the world 
according to this survey, seven are Muslim: Afghanistan, Iraq, 
Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Turkmenistan. Depressingly, 
instead of agitating for greater freedom, young people in Muslim 
countries are going in the opposite direction by demanding stricter 
adherence to the letter of the Islamic law, thereby insisting on a 
narrow observance of ritual and a denial of rationalism and 
secularism, the two preconditions for democracy.

Mercifully, these voices are relatively few in number, but they 
drown out the voices of sanity and reason by their shrillness and 
their claim to the fundamentalist high ground. Indeed, for the rest 
of the world, these people have become the face of Islam with their 
contorted, bearded faces spouting hate-filled slogans.

For readers who might feel this is an unfair portrayal of the 
Muslim world, here is another statistic to conjure with: three out 
of every four refugees today are Muslims fleeing their countries 
for either political or economic reasons. Granted that Afghanistan 
has skewed the picture with its millions of refugees who have found 
shelter in neighbouring countries, but how are we to explain the 
flood of North African, Middle Eastern and South Asian Muslims who 
have flooded Europe and North America? Most of these millions have 
made homes elsewhere to escape the poverty, poor governance and 
lack of liberty that have come to characterize and define the 
Islamic world.

Recognizing that they are in a small minority and will therefore 
never be voted into power, extremists condemn democracy as being 
'un-Islamic'. They seek, instead, to influence the agenda of 
repressive regimes, much as Pakistan's religious parties supported 
Zia and thereby rewrote our laws, pushing the legal system several 
centuries back. Saudi Arabia has been exporting an extreme Wahabi 
strand of the faith for decades. No Muslim country today serves as 
a beacon for democracy, tolerance and progress, but several compete 
for being leading exemplars of repression, intolerance and 
backwardness.

So in a sense, the two broad movements that today influence the 
Muslim psyche can be categorized as a suffocatingly anti-
progressive tendency and a shrill, murderous radicalism. These 
competing dogmas have effectively squeezed the political space 
available for a debate on the need for liberalism and democracy.

The radicals want to usher in an Islamic revolution that would 
sweep away the decadent regimes that today rule much of the Muslim 
world, but instead of replacing them with modern democracies, these 
zealots would install even more ferocious and repressive 
governments. In countries like Pakistan which (still) have some 
democratic traditions and aspirations, this competition to be 
holier than the others has moved the political agenda and rhetoric 
further to the right than ever before.

The effect of this negative portrayal of Islam abroad has been 
devastating for those millions of Muslims who have been trying to 
make a new beginning for themselves and their families in the West. 
Understandably, people are nervous about wanting to fly with 
passengers who look even remotely 'Middle Eastern'. How many 
Western businesses would today take the risk of hiring Muslims? 
While we may complain of racism, the fact remains that in a 
competitive world, Muslims will be at a disadvantage as long as 
their coreligionists loudly proclaim their intention to destroy 
western institutions.

As I have been arguing in these columns, there is a pressing need 
for a debate over the direction Islam has taken, not for the sake 
of Muslims who have left their homes, but in order to make sure 
that the next generation will not feel they have to leave to make a 
better life for themselves.

<a name="saee">Saeed Anwar withdraws from tour</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, Dec 26: Pakistan opener Saeed Anwar pulled out of next 
month's Bangladesh tour after being diagnosed with a stress 
fracture in his left hand. The left-hander has been ruled out from 
competitive cricket for three months which practically ends his 
hopes of facing the West Indies who are due here on Jan 26 for 
three Tests and as many one-day internationals.

The fracture was revealed in a bone scan. The batsman had suffered 
the injury during October's Sharjah Cup. On the basis of MRI tests 
and advice of a Dubai specialist, Saeed rested for six weeks before 
resuming his cricket this month. However, the injury aggravated 
which forced him to undergo bone scan.

The PCB has not named his replacement though a place has become 
vacant which deserves to go to Shahid Afridi who picked up five 
wickets in his debut Test and followed up with a match winning 
century against India at Chennai in 1999. Shahid, however, has been 
named as three replacements for the one-day series, which follow 
the two Tests at Dhaka and Chittagong.

<a name="twon">Two neutral umpires from April, ICC says</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
MELBOURNE, Dec 28: The International Cricket Council (ICC) will 
appoint two neutral umpires from a panel of eight for Test matches 
from April 2002, ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said.

"We will have (a panel of) eight umpires that will do 95 percent of 
the Test matches," Speed said. "Then we will have a supporting 
panel which will consist of two umpires from each (Test-playing) 
country so in total there will be 28 umpires that will be eligible 
for international cricket.

"In contrast we had 74 umpires who stood in international matches 
last year and that's too many." For one-day internationals from 
April, the ICC will use one home umpire and one international 
umpire as opposed to the current practice of two home umpires. A 
five-man panel of referees, to be headed by Sri Lankan Ranjan 
Madugalle, will also be appointed to oversee games.

The elite panel of eight umpires would be announced in February, 
Speed said. There had been reports in newspapers that the ICC was 
considering backing away from its plan which would result in local 
umpires never again officiating in a Test match in their countries. 
Currently, one home umpire and one neutral umpire officiate in Test 
matches and while that may have eliminated allegations of bias, it 
has not necessarily improved the standard of umpiring.

Umpires will be selected by Speed and chairman of the cricket 
playing committee, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar. The 
referees and umpires will be on two-year contracts. Speed said the 
ICC would give players a chance to have their say on who should be 
appointed to the umpiring panel.

Speed said with an elite panel of umpires the ICC would be able to 
provide far more assistance to umpires in a bid to eliminate poor 
decisions. "If an umpire is clearly out of form we will work with 
him and we will work a lot harder with umpires than we have done 
previously," he said. -Reuters/AFP

<a name="iccs">ICC's anti-graft body to monitor Jr World Cup</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Dec 25: The Anti-Corruption Unit of the International 
Cricket Council (ICC) has decided to monitor next month's Junior 
World Cup in New Zealand in an effort to curb match-fixing, reports 
said. In letters sent to the boards of all the 16 competing 
nations, the unit informed that it intends deputing a team of 
officials who would keep an eye on activities of junior players 
during the biennial Junior World Cup. 

"Since most of these junior players would represent their country's 
senior teams in future, the ACU wants to create in them the 
awareness to avoid illegal practices," the letter mentioned. The 
unit said a two-member official team would give guidelines to 
youngsters to stay away from unconcerned people and make sure that 
they do not mix up with strangers. "I think it is a step in the 
right direction. After the Cronje episode, the ICC was under 
immense pressure to take such strict measures," Pakistan junior 
team coach Haroon Rasheed told SADA. 

"PCB has already included clauses on match-fixing and on doping in 
the contracts of these youngsters. We have briefed them on the 
menace," Haroon said. Haroon, who also coached Pakistan senior 
team, refused to accept that the ICC check would make junior 
players uncomfortable. "No. It's nothing that could pressurize 
them. It has now become part of the game," he said. Pakistan's 
junior team will also benefit from the weeklong coaching from 
former West Indian captain Clive Lloyd. -SADA

<a name="cont">Contingent for Games approved</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, Dec 24: The Pakistan Olympic Association general council 
has discussed the national sports policy-2001 in detail in a 
meeting.

The general council has authorized its president Syed Wajid Ali 
Shah to form a delegation which will apprise federal sports 
ministry the concerns of the POA and the national sports 
federations as well as the complications likely to emerge as a 
result of the implementation of the sports policy. The meeting also 
discussed and approved the participation of Pakistan contingent in 
the 9th SAF Games to be held in Islamabad from March 30 to April 8, 
2001.

Earlier, the Games were scheduled to be held from Oct 6 to 15 but 
postponed due to the Sept 11 attacks in USA. In view of the new 
dates of the games, the federations whose sports were included in 
the programmes of these games were directed to send their fresh 
entries to the POA, six weeks before the start of the Games so that 
the consolidated entries could be sent to the Organising Committee.

The director technical of the SAF Games Lt. Col (retd.) Mohammad 
Yahya also attended the meeting and advised the federations to 
ensure that the technical delegates and international 
judges/referees be called from the Asian continent as it would be 
economical in term of their travelling expenses.

The POA secretary general apprised the house that the Organizing 
Committee of the XVII Commonwealth Games which are being held at 
Manchester from July 25 to Aug 4, 2002 had allotted a quota of 63 
persons to Pakistan out of which 56 would be accommodated in the 
Manchester Main Village and seven persons shooting squad in Bisley 
Village.

The POA secretary also informed the house about the details of the 
participation of Pakistan contingent in the 14th Asian Games to be 
held at Busan, South Korea from Sept 29 to Oct 14. It was decided 
that subject to the availability of funds maximum participation in 
all sports should be ensured, keeping in view the past performance 
in the last Asian Games and prospects of winning medals in the 14th 
Asian Games.

The house supported the stand taken by the POA for organizing the 
29th National Games at Quetta, subject to the availability of 
minimum facilities of one tartan track and one international 
standard swimming pool. The house approved the action of the POA 
president of suspending the Sindh Olympic Association (SOA) on 
account of violation committed by the provincial association.

The house unanimously elected Professor Dr Nishat Mallick, Patron 
Medical Commission of the POA as individual member of the POA on 
account of his valuable contribution to the promotion of sports 
medicine in Pakistan as well as in Asia and the world. The house 
also unanimously decided to urge Pakistan Sports Board to allow 
recognition of Pakistan Tug of War Federation and the Pakistan 
Wushu Federation.

By Ian Fyfe

KARACHI, Dec 24: The year 2001 spelt a good year for Pakistan, when 
former world No.3 Saleh Mohammad, who missed the National 
Championship in Quetta stormed back in the Asian Snooker 
Championship to reach the semi-finals before he was outwitted by 
China's teenage sensation Jin Long.

This was the third time that the Asian Snooker Championship was 
held in Pakistan. The previous two in 1991 and 1998, where the 
former world champion was crowned the new Asian champ, coming from 
behind to overhaul Thailand's top player in the final 11-10.

But this year although Pakistan could not produce another Asian 
champion, the country fared well amongst the 18 participating 
nations. Off the eight players that comprised the Pakistan 
contingent, six, Mohammad Yousuf, Saleh Mohammad, Naveen Perwani, 
Khurram Agha, Mohammad Shafiq and Abu Salem, the babe of the team 
reached the last 16.
