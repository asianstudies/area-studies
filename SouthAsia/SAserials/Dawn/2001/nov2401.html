<a name="mush">Musharraf to stay as President</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov 23: President Gen Pervez Musharraf has decided to
continue to hold the office of the presidency even after the
October 2002 elections, informed sources said here.

He would, however, not go through the process of elections but
perhaps use the powers he enjoys today under the provisional
constitution order (PCO) to give himself an extension of at least
three years.

The president, it is believed, feels that it would take him at
least about three to four years to complete and strengthen the
democratic and other institutions which he had started building
soon after taking over the government on October 12, 1999.
Therefore, the sources added, he had decided to remain president
for three to four years more. It is not clear if he would continue
to hold the post of COAS in which he had already given himself
extension for an indefinite period.

The sources said the elections would be held in time and there was
no plan to set up a coalition government. Also, they said, the
government was cutting no deals with any political party. They said
the government was rather amused at the way some politicians were
trying to create the impression that any deal was in the offing.

When asked about the scheduled visit of Benazir Bhutto to India,
the sources said the government was fully in control of things in
the country and was not at all perturbed by such developments.

Meanwhile, the government is said to be continuously studying its
Afghan policy and the policy makers reportedly meet every other day
to assess the situation. The government, it is said, believes that
it had successfully safeguarded its national security, its Kashmir
cause and nuclear assets in the aftermath of the September 11
tragedy. However, the recent statements by some US diplomats
equating the Kashmir freedom struggle and terrorism have caused
Pakistan to take up the issue with various world leaders.

Pakistan is also concerned about the growing public perception that
it was being ordered around by the US. There were reports that the
US was searching Pakistan's ships in its waters for Osama bin Laden
and also that it had closed down the Taliban embassy on the
instructions of the US. The government is said to be chalking out a
strategy to counter this impression.

<a name="kara">Karazai may get PM slot in interim setup</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov 23: Hamid Karazai, former foreign minister of
Afghanistan with royal family links and a respected Pakhtoon
leader, is likely to get an important position in the transitional
government that is expected to emerge following the UN-sponsored
Bonn conference of all Afghan factions scheduled to be held in the
coming week.

Informed circles did not rule out the possibility of Mr Karazai
getting the prime ministerial slot with the former King, Zahir
Shah, functioning as a symbolic figure head of the state.

These circles said Pakistan, which has no objection to Zahir Shah
playing a role in keeping the unity of Afghanistan intact with his
presence in the country, would be more than satisfied if Karazai
was made the chief executive in the transitional government.

Pakistan, these circles said, was likely to send two high-level
officials including one from the foreign office to Bonn to attend
the conference as interested observers.

According to these circles, Islamabad was at first very much upset
with the arrival of Northern Alliance troops in Kabul but later
dismissed the unsavoury development as a tactical reverse because
the world, Islamabad realized, was still pursuing the final
objective of getting a broad-based, multi-ethnic government formed
in Kabul.

Afghan watchers in Islamabad said that the Northern Alliance troops
were encouraged by Iran in its own self interest to take over Kabul
after Taliban vacated the city.

Pakistan was also worried in the beginning at the absence of any
known Pakhtoon face who would be able to bring all the Pakhtoon
factions together and enable them to speak with one voice.

The Uzbeks were being led by Commander Rashid Dostum, Tajiks by
Commander Fahim, the Hazaras by Commander Khalili, Commander Ismail
was in control of Herat, and there were a number of strongholds in
the North which were being led by pro-Rabbani commanders. However,
as soon as the war in Afghanistan entered into its decisive phase a
number of Pakhtoon leaders with known faces also came into the
picture. These included Maulvi Qadeer and Deen Mohammad, both
brothers of Commander Haq who was killed by the Taliban very early
in the war. Younis Khalis and Commander Wardek were also considered
to be high-profile Pakhtoon leaders with significant following.

Prof Abur Rab Rasul Sayyaf and Gulbadin Hikmatyar too are expected
to take a position along with the Pakhtoon majority. However,
informed circles here identified Hamid Karazai as the man who would
finally end up representing the Pakhtoons as well as the country
itself which it is believed is likely to emerge as a loose
federation administered by the jirga system both at the local as
well as at the federal level.

Pakistan is said to be continuing its efforts to get Kabul
demilitarized and get the UN to cobble up a multinational force
made up of troops from Turkey, Malaysia, Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Pakistan is also said to be keenly watching what India, Russia and
Iran are doing in order to influence the developments in
Afghanistan in their favour. However, Islamabad seems to have
persuaded itself into accepting the theory that Russia and US were
still engaged in an international war of influence peddling,
therefore, it believes that with the US visibly on the side of
Pakistan, there was not much the Russian and Indian nexus could do
to harm Pakistan's interests.

Meanwhile, Pakistan is said to have requested the world community
to get those trapped in Kunduz to surrender to some authority other
than the Northern Alliance and then facilitate the transfer of
these persons to Tajikistan.

<a name="team">Team leaves for Kabul to trace Pakistanis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Nov 23: An Afghan delegation left here for Kabul to track
down missing Pakistani fighters in Afghanistan and secure their
release.

The 22-member delegation would meet 'President' Rabbani and other
Northern Alliance leaders in Kabul and negotiate with them for the
release of Pakistani fighters in Afghanistan, a Press release said.
The Tehrik-i-Nifaz-i-Shariat Mohammadi(TNSM) that had mobilised and
taken thousands of its activists to Afghanistan to take part in the
fight against the United States, says that over 2000 of its
fighters are still unaccounted for.

Hundreds of Pakistani fighters are holding out along with Taliban
and other non-Afghan militants in the besieged northern city of
Kunduz. The Northern Alliance says that the non-Afghan fighters
would be arrested and tried under the laws of the Islamic State of
Afghanistan.

The Press release said the Pakistani nation had treated Afghan
refugees with sympathy and a spirit of brotherhood since the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan. Therefore, it was incumbent upon the
Afghans to try all-out efforts to maintain these relations and
secure the release of Pakistanis captured by the Northern Alliance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 22: Coalition forces will not allow a safe passage
to non-Afghan fighters besieged in Kunduz by the Northern Alliance,
a CIS spokesman said.

"We will certainly not like to see the grant of safe passage to the
non-afghan fighters back to their countries," Ambassador Kenton
Keith of the Coalition Information Service told his daily briefing.

All the Taliban fighters would be treated according to
international norms, he clarified. He said all the non-Afghan
fighters should be detained and registered with the International
Commission for Red Crescent and added that their future would be
discussed with their countries.

He advised the Afghan fighters to lay down their arms immediately
to avoid further bloodshed. "The best way to save lives in Kunduz
is for the taliban there to surrender."

He said they had heard encouraging reports that the Kunduz
situation was moving towards a peaceful conclusion.

ISLAMABAD, Nov 22: The government ordered closure of the Taliban
embassy. Speaking at a Press briefing, foreign office spokesman
Aziz Ahmed Khan said the decision was conveyed to the Afghan
Ambassador, Mulla Abdul Salam Zaef.

<a name="tali">Taliban rule out talks on Kandahar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

SPIN BOLDUK, Nov 20: The Taliban have ignored the call for holding
negotiations with any tribal delegation for surrendering Kandahar,
and said that Mulla Omar has not authorized Haji Bashar to hold
talks in this regard.

"All such reports are baseless and wrong. We are not holding talks
with any tribal and other groups regarding our withdrawal from
Kandahar," Mulla Najibullah Sherzai, a senior official of the
Taliban foreign ministry, told reporters on Tuesday. He said that
Kandahar was fully under the control of the Taliban.

Answering a question, he said Haji Bashar was not chief commander
of the Taliban.  "He is a supporter of the Taliban and he has no
taken part in the war against the United States."

He rejected the claims of different tribal groups that they were
holding negotiations with Haji Bashar for taking over Kandahar.

Mulla Sherzai said that the Taliban had withdrawn from Kabul and
other provinces to save the innocent Afghans from the US bombing.
"We are planning to take back all these provinces and cities. Soon,
the world would see our action in this regard," he pledged.

About the Kunduz situation, he said the province was still under
the Taliban who were fighting the Northern Alliance forces.
However, he pointed out, if Mulla Omar ordered so then the Taliban
would withdraw from Kunduz to save the civilians from the bombing.

In reply to a question about Osama bin Laden, the Taliban official
said they had no information about the presence of Osama in
Kandahar. However, he confirmed, that Mulla Omar was in Kandahar,
running the government affairs.

<a name="came">Pakistan came out of crisis safely: Anwer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 18: The government has steered the country safely
through the crisis by following the policy of being part of the
international coalition against terrorism. This was stated by
Information and Media Development Secretary Syed Anwer Mahmood at a
press conference. He called it a "big achievement".

Pakistan, he said, supported the war against terrorism as a matter
of principle. "If we would not support the international coalition,
one cannot imagine the consequences for Pakistan," he said, adding
that Pakistan did not join the coalition for any economic
consideration.

The information secretary reiterated Pakistan's call for a broad-
based, multi-ethnic political dispensation in Afghanistan, and said
that the Security Council's resolution on the issue had vindicated
Islamabad's policy. "There is no other option but to have a multi-
ethnic, broad-based government. It is only a matter of time, and
the sooner the un moves in that direction the better."

Referring to Prof Burhanuddin Rabbani's statement in which he had
stated that a meeting of all the Afghan groups would be convened in
Kabul to discuss the formation of a broad-based government, the
secretary said the international community was moving in that
direction and hoped the situation would be soon normalized as a
result of the initiatives taken by special UN envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi.

Mr Mahmood said that whichever government was installed in
Afghanistan, it would be in the interest of Pakistan to have
friendly relations with that.

Mr Mahmood said the transitional government and its successor would
be broad-based which meant that even the interim government had to
be broad-based.

He dispelled the concerns of a questioner about the fallout of the
present critical situation in Afghanistan and said: "We don't have
to be overly worried."

Responding to a question about the Taliban, he said that in any
political dispensation, Taliban cannot be wished away. There has to
be distinction between the hardcore leadership of Taliban under
Mulla Omar and thousands of Afghans who followed him.

Pakistan, he said, had not yet made any contact with the Northern
Alliance and added that the UN envoy was taking initiatives for a
broad-based government and when such deliberations took place under
the world body, Islamabad would take appropriate steps.

"When we talk of a broad-based, multi-ethnic government in 
Afghanistan, it means that Northern Alliance can be part of that 
dispensation, he said.

Asked about the implications of the government policy on Kashmir 
issue and relations with India, the information secretary said that 
by becoming part of the international coalition the government had 
succeeded in neutralizing Indian propaganda.

He said the world leaders had recognized that Kashmir is the core 
issue which must be resolved by India and Pakistan in accordance 
with the wishes of the Kashmiri people.

He referred to statements of President Gen Pervez Musharraf who had 
told US President George W. Bush that there was a freedom struggle 
going on in occupied Kashmir and there should be a difference 
between a freedom struggle and terrorism.

He also referred to the statement of Secretary of State Colin 
Powell that Kashmir was a dispute which Pakistan and India should 
resolve through negotiations.

Leaders of many other countries, including France and Germany, too 
were saying that Kashmir was a disputed territory and with this 
policy Pakistan had, in fact, strengthened the Kashmir cause.

He termed reports that Osama bin Laden, Mulla Omar and others had 
crossed into Pakistan figment of imagination. He described such 
reports as irresponsible and motivated.

About the Afghanistan embassy in Islamabad, he said it would 
continue to exist till a permanent government took over in 
Afghanistan.

<a name="play">Pakistan playing major role in UN: Shamshad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK, Nov 18: Pakistan is playing a leadership role in the 
United Nations, said the country's permanent representative to the 
UN, Shamshad Ahmad. He said in an interview with the APP that 
Pakistan's profile in the world body received a major boost during 
the recent visit by the president to New York to participate in the 
general debate of the UN General Assembly.

"The president's visit reaffirmed to the international community
Pakistan's principled policy on fight against terrorism, which was
in keeping with the UN charter and resolutions.

Our decision to be a part of the international coalition is rooted
in our abhorrence of terrorism in all its forms and
manifestations," he said.

He said Pakistan was a recognized and respected name in the UN and 
during the year, it had been elected to the Commission on Human 
Rights, the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, and the Executive Boards 
of the UN Development Programme and the UN Family Planning 
Association. Election to the Commission on Narcotic Drugs was with 
a record 52 votes out of 53.

He said Pakistan had also won last month unanimous endorsement of 
the Asian group for its candidacy for the UN Security Council. 
Pakistan is a candidate for the non-permanent seat of the UNSC for 
2003-04.

The elections are to be held during the 57th session of the General 
Assembly next year. Endorsement by the Asian group, with support 
from leading countries like Japan, China and Saudi Arabia, has 
paved the way for Pakistan's victory. 

He said this was an ample acknowledgement of Pakistan's strong 
credentials and its commitment to the cause of international peace 
and security. He said Pakistan was one of the largest troop 
contributors to UN peacekeeping operations. So far, Pakistan has 
contributed to 28 peacekeeping operations, including police and 
civilian personnel beside troops.-APP

<a name="nang">Nangarhar gets interim govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Zulfiqar Ali

JALALABAD, Nov 17: The Eastern Zone Leadership Council agreed to 
establish a broad-based, interim arrangement for the Nangarhar 
province headed by the former governor, Haji Abdul Qadeer.

The five-member council appointed Haji Mohammad Zaman corps 
commander and Commander Hazrat Ali, an ally of the Northern 
Alliance, security chief of the province bordering Pakistan. Maulvi 
Mulla Jan Shinwari was nominated deputy corps commander.

Functioning as a recommendatory body, the council was set up in 
Peshawar soon after the Northern Alliance forces captured Mazar-i-
Sharif.

The Eastern Zone supreme council, comprising Haji Din Mohammad, 
Qazi Amin Waqad, Maulvi Fazl Hadi Shinwari, Maulvi Samiullah 
Najeebi and Mir Sameeul Haq, would also announce the interim setup 
for the another three Pakhtoon-dominated provinces - Kunar, Laghman 
and Nooristan - within next few days.

Talking to Dawn at the Governor's House in Jalalabad, Haji Qadeer, 
Haji Zaman and Hazrat Ali said that they had accepted the council's 
decision wholeheartedly and would work for peace and stability in 
the province.

<a name="anpn">ANP not supporting govt: Asfandyar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ashraf Mumtaz 

LAHORE, Nov 18: Awami National Party president Asfandyar Wali says 
his party's policy on Afghanistan is the same which was some 15 
years ago and adherence to it does not mean that the ANP has 
started supporting the Musharraf government.

Talking to Dawn, he said his party did not recognize Gen Pervez 
Musharraf as president and was of the opinion that the elections 
should be held as early as possible to return the country to 
democracy.

Asfandyar said for the past one decade and a half his party had 
consistently been demanding an end to foreign interference in 
Afghanistan, convening of a Loya Jirga and the establishment of a 
broad-based government in Kabul. "What the present government is 
saying today is what the ANP has been demanding for the past 15 
years. This means the government has boarded our boat and not the 
vice versa," Asfandyar said.

<a name="bena">Benazir urges CE to broaden political base</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Latafat Ali Siddiqui

TORONTO, Nov 17: Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has urged 
President Pervez Musharraf to broaden his political base as his 
government struggles to justify the US campaign against Taliban in 
the face of hard-line Muslim opposition.

She praised Musharraf for showing "a lot of nerves" by sidelining 
powerful figures in the regime who were sympathetic to the Taliban, 
but told NBC she hopes his government "will now try to broaden its 
political base by co-opting the democratic parties in an interim 
government."

Meanwhile, Ms Bhutto wrote a lengthy article in the Globe and Mail, 
that in the national interest, Gen Musharraf should hold fair and 
free elections and hand over power to the elected representatives.

"Gen Musharraf," she wrote, "has yet to seize the window of 
opportunity, even as it begins to close as the country heads toward 
the general election date mandated by the Supreme Court for 
October, 2002. Even as he talks of the need for a broad-based 
government in Afghanistan, he ignores joint opposition calls to 
form an interim government in Pakistan."

Benazir pointed out that Gen Musharraf, when asked recently whether 
he would run for president, replied that he would remain the 
president and "only the legalities have to be worked out." This 
startling revelation, she said, "raises concern that the oft-
promised return to democracy is little more than a fig-leaf for a 
continuation of military dictatorship."

According to Ms Bhutto, the stability of Pakistan is critical to 
the stability of South Asia, as well as the Muslim world. "In my 
view, that stability is rooted in a return to a truly 
representative democratic order."

Ms Bhutto disclosed that her party "is in negotiation with Gen 
Musharraf to facilitate an exit strategy for the military. There is 
still a large gulf between the two sides, even though some 
confidence-building steps have been taken. We hope that Gen 
Musharraf's regime has the vision to conciliate rather than 
confront the moderate political forces even as the extremists take 
to the streets."

Benazir observed: "Gen Musharraf now stands at the crossroads, as 
does my nation. He signaled a purging of the military and 
intelligence apparatus with the removal of hard-line generals 
identified with pro-Taliban elements. He aligned Pakistan with the 
forces of freedom that emerged to stand against terrorism. As a 
result, the United States lifted sanctions, pledged a significant 
economic assistance package, and agreed to substantial debt 
retirement to give the Pakistani economy room to breathe and grow.

"If Gen Pervez Musharraf chooses the path of Zia ul-Haq, the 
political situation in Pakistan could quickly degenerate into a 
fundamentalist revolution. Not only would this empower terrorism 
and extremism in the world, but Pakistan's nuclear arsenal could be 
compromised. But if Gen Musharraf nurtures a return to democracy in 
Pakistan, he could win the support of the new parliament and the 
people as a different dictator."

ISLAMABAD, Nov 17: Pakistan expressed the confidence that the

Afghanistan.

"We find it urgent to call a meeting of Afghan groups so that a

briefing.

In reply to a question, he said all those Afghan groups who
intended to make their contribution towards the multi-ethnic
process should be invited.

Pakistan's position, he stated, was that Kabul should be
demilitarized and a multi-ethnic force should take it over so that
an interim government got inducted and no infighting erupted or any
past atrocity recurred.

He said that Pakistan had in the past supported the United Nations,
the Organization of Islamic Conference and Six-plus-Two efforts for
such a government in that country. He was optimistic that such an
arrangement would be worked out soon.

Pakistan would not grant political asylum to Osama bin Laden and
Taliban leader Mulla Mohammad Omar, the spokesman said.

The spokesman dismissed a question whether Pakistan would grant
asylum to the two if they sought it under the relevant Geneva
convention.

"The Geneva convention cannot be applied so simply that everybody 
can (get asylum)," Mr Khan said. "Asylum is given to those who you 
think should be given asylum. The country giving asylum takes a 
decision under international laws as well as its own laws," he 
said.

"So far as these persons you have mentioned, we have made it clear 
they will not be given asylum," Mr Khan said of Mulla Omar and 
Osama.-Agencies

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 23: Pakistan has once again refused to open its
borders with Afghanistan to accept more Afghan refugees and decided
to stick to the policy of allowing entry to only vulnerable
refugees.

The recently-appointed chief commissioner for Afghan Refugees, Syed
Asif Shah, said an estimated danger of a huge influx of refugees
had been averted by following the policy of ensuring food security
inside Afghanistan and encouraging national and international
donors to set up and maintain camps for internally displaced
persons (IDPs).

He said the unwillingness of the government to accept more refugees
was based on a bitter experience in 1995 when the world community
had left over three million Afghan refugees at the meagre resources
of Pakistan.

According to the official, as the UN bodies have expressed
inability to establish camps for the IDPs, the government has
started encouraging some national relief organizations, including
the Pakistan Medical Association, the Edhi Foundation and PRCS, to
take an initiative and coordinate efforts for establishing camps
inside Afghanistan across Torkham and Chaman areas.

Staff Correspondent

FAISALABAD, Nov 21: PPP's Secretary General Aftab Ahmed Khan has
urged President Gen Pervez Musharraf to direct the Election
Commission authorities to accelerate work for holding general
elections in the country.

Talking to newsmen, he said that only an elected government can
steer the country out of the present crisis. He said that in view
of rapidly changing situation in Afghanistan, the military rulers
should constitute a committee comprising senior politicians,
military high-ups and renowned journalists for reviewing the
situation and suggest feasible policies.

He said that the PPP had already raised its voice for uprooting
terrorism. He claimed that some government functionaries had
launched a vilification campaign against the politicians only to
achieve their ulterior motives bringing bad name to the Musharraf
government.

Criticizing the government steps to give special attention to the
rescheduling of loans, he proposed that efforts should be made for
the revival of national economy by encouraging foreign investor and
exploring new markets for the indigenous products.

He also demanded that the federal government should announce a
fresh financial policy in accordance with present industrial and
economical scenario of the country.

<a name="pppm">PPP might part ways with ARD</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Nov 19: The fate of the Alliance for Restoration of
Democracy hangs in the balance after the sudden dissociation of the
Awami National Party and indications that the Pakistan People's
Party will soon follow suit.

Sources privy to the conversation between PPP chairperson Benazir
Bhutto and ANP president Asfandyar Wali before the Nov 17 ARD
meeting said the former prime minister had asked the ANP only to
"DELAY" the decision for a couple of weeks and had "NOT PRESSED THE
ANP NOT TO PART WAYS" with the ARD.

The ANP leaders have gathered the impression that the PPP could
take a decision about its association with the ARD any time.
However, ARD president Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan is confident that
the alliance will stay intact and play its role for the restoration
of democracy.

He said the PPP had not left the Nov 17 ARD meeting despite
prolonged canvassing by the ANP. This, he said, showed that the
party wanted to remain in the coalition. The PPP leaders who
represented the party at the alliance meeting had said that their
party was a component of the ARD and would remain in it.

It is said that the ANP leaders who had decided to break ties with
the ARD had not taken the party into confidence. An important party
leader is believed to have conveyed the impression to the ARD
leadership, expressing concern over what his colleagues had done.

He also said that the PPP would take an active part in the future

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 22: The jailed PPP leader, Asif Ali Zardari, has
confirmed that his party is holding dialogues with the government,
but said no secret deal would be made.

"Being politicians and members of a large political party, we
believe in dialogue as a key to the resolution of the problems," he
told newsmen.

Mr Zardari said that he would not leave the country like Nawaz
Sharif. He claimed the government wanted to hold early general
elections in the country, most probably in March, after the fall of
Taliban government in Afghanistan due to high sentiments of the
public, particularly in Balochistan and the NWFP. He was of the
view that the extremist religious parties could take advantage and
exploit the situation.

However, Mr Zardari doubted the elections would be held in free,
fair and transparent manner. He said in the past dictators had
always imposed hand-picked people on the nation through the
elections. He said all sections of the society, including
journalists, lawyers, academicians, scientists and scholars, should
realize that the country had suffered most due to this practice of
imposing hand-picked people on the nation. Even the newly-elected 
Nazims should realize this fact because their importance would 
emerge only if fair elections are held," Mr Zardari observed.

ISLAMABAD, Nov 20: The Supreme Court dismissed Asif Ali Zardari's
petition against the order of the Chief Justice of Lahore High
Court transferring two cases involving Asif Zardari to
Accountability Court, Attock Fort.

The Supreme Court bench held that after going through the record of
the cases, it was of the view that no illegality had been committed
by Chief Justice of Lahore High Court in exercizing his discretion
in accepting Prosecutor-General of Accountability's application for
transfer of cases from accountability courts at Lahore and
Rawalpindi to Attock Fort accountability court.

The Supreme Court also dismissed a review petition filed by Mr
Zardari against the order of the Supreme Court in which it was held
that the Accountability Courts should conclude the trial of the
cases within three months. However, if Mr Zardari or anyone on his
behalf caused delay in the trial of the cases, he should remain in
Islamabad until the trials are concluded, the bench observed.

The court further observed that it was an order passed with the
consent of the parties and no case had been made out for the review
of the earlier order. The court, however, directed the
Accountability Court, Attock Fort, to conclude the trial within
three months of the passing of Supreme Court order. The SC bench
comprised Justice Sheikh Riaz Ahmad, Justice Mian Mohammad Ajmal

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Nov 20: Hope of any early end to the agony of the collapsed
Taj Company depositors was belied when a lawyer claiming to lead
one of their factions sought adjournment of proceedings aimed at
working out a settlement.

Justice Jawad S. Khwaja, a Lahore High Court company judge, had
before him a plan drawn up by Advocate Tariq Kamal Qazi for
restructuring the company with the depositors as its shareholders.
The plan was opposed by Deputy Attorney-General Khwaja Saeeduz
Zafar on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
successor to the Corporate Law Authority, whose plea for the
liquidation of the company to satisfy the claims of the creditors
and depositors was accepted by the LHC but stayed by the Supreme
Court.

The DAG said the depositors were interested in refund of their
stuck-up amounts and not in revival plans which may or may not
work. There were serious differences among the depositors and it
was almost impossible to make them agree on a plan. The judge,
however, said a meeting of the depositors having 75 per cent of the
stuck-up amount was worth calling as some good may come out of it.
They were free to accept or reject the plan.

However, as the judge took up the petition, Advocate Khurram Wasti
sought adjournment of the hearing to study the plan thoroughly.
Justice Khwaja was surprised at the request as, he said, the
depositors should be more keen on a prompt disposal. Accepting it,
however, he adjourned the case for Feb 5.

HUNZA, Nov 21: At a meeting held between Pakistan and Chinese
immigration authorities at Sost, upper Hunza, reoppening of the
border was decided here.

Representing the Chinese immigration authorities, Mr Wuvee, the
deputy chief, immigration, Tashqurghand, said there were almost 116
Pakistan-bound trucks, carrying trade goods, were stranded in
Urumchi, which would soon be allowed to enter Pakistan via Sost. He
said that the border was closed on October 9 this year following
the Sept 11 attacks in US.

The Chinese official explained that the closure of Khunjerab border
was due to the proximity of the Karakoram Highway to Afghanistan
and the political turmoil there, which could pose a threat to
security in the area.

Mr Mohummad Ghias, the Pakistani counterpart of Mr Wuvee, said the
border would remain partially open as long as the immigration
authorities in both countries deemed it fit to be so.

Later, talking to newsmen, Mr Wuvee said the border would remain
open only for cargo service and that business tours, individual
trips and all such activities across the border would not be
allowed.

lost their livelihood due to a large inferno that broke out on
Monday night.

The fire broke out at the electric meter room located at the first
floor of the six-storey Karim Centre on Zaibunnisa Street and
spread to other meter rooms.

According to the fire brigade assessment, about 120 shops were
gutted while over 50 shops suffered partial damaged, but their

not be recommissioned perhaps at least for a week for business,
opined a firefighter at the spot.

The fire which broke out around 1:45 am on Monday was put out by
Tuesday evening by the fire department. The chief fire officer told
Dawn that all the exit points were blocked, the improper electrical
wiring added to the spread of fire. The presence of numerous small
petrol-filled generators on each floor also added to the fire and
the huge quantity of combustible material made matters worse, Atta
ur Rehman said.

Regarding the building structure, he said that at the moment the
superstructure was intact and their was no danger of collapse.
However, he added that the KBCA might carry out a survey and
determine the status of the building structure.

ISLAMABAD, Nov 21: The judge of the Islamabad family court,
Mohammad Jehangir Mir rejected the petition, filed by singer Adnan
Sami Khan, seeking custody of his son Azan, who is at present
living with Zeba Bakhtiar, former wife of the petitioner.

Zeba had obtained the custody of the seven-year-old child after
fighting a long legal battle that ended in the Supreme Court.

Soon after divorce, Adnan had taken the child to Dubai and then
Canada. The Supreme Court had directed the ministries of interior
and foreign affairs to ensure the delivery of the child to the
mother. The court had passed the order under the Muslim Family Law
Ordinance.

In his latest petition, Adnan Sami Khan had contended that the
child had attained the prescribed age limit and that it was in the
best interest of the child in terms of his education and growth
that he should be given into his custody. The court, however,
observed since Zeba Bakhtiar had obtained the child's custody from
the Supreme Court, the petition could not be entertained.

It may be mentioned that Adnan's father Arshad Sami Khan has also
filed a damages suit to the tune of Rs5 million against Zeba
Bakhtiar and her father for allegedly bringing his family into
disrepute by levelling baseless allegations. The case is yet to be
decided by another civil court of Islamabad.

By Nasir Iqbal

ISLAMABAD, Nov 23: An accountability court indicted ex-director of
National Institute of Health (NIH) Aurengzeb Toru on charges of
acquiring property worth Rs17.2 million beyond his known source of
income.

The charges stated that the accused Aurengzeb Toru, being NIH

and amassed properties worth Rs17.2 million in connivance with co-
accused Sukbar Khan and Javed Khan, who also acted as his
"BENAMIDARS" and front men.

According to the charges, the accused was the owner of a plot No

Rs990,000 in his name. He then constructed a house on the same plot
with a cost of Rs1.2 million which he later transferred in the name
of his wife. According to the charges, the accused purchased

Gala) in June 1999 at Rs600,000 in his name.

He also purchased a plot measuring 13.5 marlas in the same vicinity

<a name="usre">US ready to defer loan repayments</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov 23: The US has indicated to Pakistan that it is
prepared to extend repayment period of its outstanding loan to 40
years with a grace period of 16 years.

According to independent economists, this would amount to a write-
off of about 35-40 per cent of the outstanding loan amounting to $3
billion.

Informed sources, however, said that Pakistan was trying to get the
US to also reduce the interest rates on this loan which, if
Washington agreed, would mean a write off, equivalent to 70-80 per
cent of the loan. They said Pakistan was expected to make a case
for an extension in the repayment periods and reduction in interest
rates for all its bilateral outstanding loans at the forthcoming
Paris Club meeting tentatively scheduled for Dec 11.

Pakistan seems to have come to the conclusion that the donors for
their own respective reasons were not in a position to accept its
request for a write off of all its bilateral debt amounting to
about $12.5 billion.

Some of the donors like Germany and Japan are reported to have
explained to Pakistan that if they made an exception in Islamabad's
case then they would have to do the same for some other heavily-
indebted countries as well which they were not in a position to do.
Russia is said to be heavily indebted to Germany.

Meanwhile, Pakistan is said to be fairly satisfied with the extent
of fiscal support which the donors are extending currently for
budgetary and balance of payments support and hopes that this
support would be further expanded with the passage of time.

Pakistan is also pressing for increased market access and expects
the US and Japan to come around to accepting this request soon. The
European Union has already enhanced the market access which alone
is estimated to increase export earning by 500 to 700 million
dollars annually.

Pakistan is also watching rather keenly the various international
developments taking place on the Afghan reconstruction and
rehabilitation front and hopes to make massive gains once these
efforts are launched.

The domestic cement and iron and steel industries as well as many
other economic activities are expected to get a boost as a result
of the commencement of work for rebuilding Afghanistan as Pakistan
because of its proximity and 2,500 km long border with Afghanistan
hopes to serve as the most acceptable conduit for skilled and
unskilled labour, material and capital going into Afghanistan
during the reconstruction period which is likely to last for about
20 years and cost as many billion dollars.

Pakistan also expects to gain from the eventual development and
exploitation of Central Asian oil and gas wealth as the US which
has strategic interest in these assets would hopefully like this
wealth to be marketed through Afghanistan and Pakistan routes
rather than through Russian or Iranian routes.

This is said to be one of the two reasons why Pakistan believes
this time the US would not walk away from Afghanistan. The other
reason, it is believed, is Washington's long-term interest in
getting rid of international terrorism which it thinks has taken
firm roots in Afghanistan.

of about $12 billion from the Paris Club member countries in order
to put its wrecked economy, hit hard by the Sept 11 terror attacks
and the ongoing war in Afghanistan, back on the rails. Though it is
not clear whether the lenders would agree to its request for debt
relief or not, there are some indications of positive response in
return for Pakistan's support to the US-led international coalition
against terrorism.

To a question about the government's request seeking a low-cost
Poverty Reduction and Growth Fund facility from the International
Monetary Fund, he declined to give the details.

"You'll know the details when the IMF executive board meets on Dec 
5," he said. "I cannot divulge anything right now."  It is pertinent
to note here that he was rebuked by an IMF spokesman last year when
he claimed that the IMF had agreed to provide $596 million low-cost
facility for 10 months to Pakistan to support its balance of
payments weeks before the IMF board gave its approval.

Shaukat Aziz said the government was also "negotiating debt swaps 
with Germany, Italy, the UK, and Norway for education, health and 
some other areas of social sector".

He said President Gen Pervez Musharraf would preside over a high-
level meeting at Islamabad on Monday to "APPROVE SEVERAL
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OUTSIDE THE PSDP" in the areas of education,
health, and poverty reduction.

He was hopeful that the infrastructure projects being launched by
the government would help reduce poverty, and create thousands of
new jobs for the unemployed.

He was hopeful that the infrastructure projects being launched by 
the government would help reduce poverty, and create thousands of 
new jobs for the unemployed.

He said: "Pakistan has so far received $600 million from the US." 
Japan has committed to provide Pakistan $300 million, the UK $100 
million, and the European Union $50 million.

Unlike past, he claimed, the "donors had attached no condition to 
the funds transferred to Pakistan that was reflective of their 
confidence in our economic policies and programmes".

"The donors are confident that the money given to us would not be 
wasted by us and would be spent to improve the social sector," he 
said.

<a name="wbst">WB strategy for reconstruction of Afghanistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawaid Bokhari

KARACHI, Nov 23: The World Bank is developing a strategy, plan and
appropriate mechanism to fund and manage the reconstruction of
Afghanistan.

Going by the experience of post-conflict reconstruction in other
countries, the WB has thrown up ideas and proposals in an Approach
Paper (AP) that would be on the agenda of 3-day major conference,
it is co-sponsoring with UNDP and ADB in Islamabad from November
27.

Initial thoughts include the creation of a Trust Fund to mobilize
external support and setting up of a reconstruction agency in
Afghanistan. The strategy would be finalized after seeking guidance
from WB board of directors.

The reconstruction plan would have both short-term and medium-term
components. Short-term priority areas include: Agricultural
recovery, generation of livelihoods for returning refugees and
displaced people, supporting existing communities through provision
of basic services and small-scale development and empowerment
programmes, rapid rehabilitation of main road network, expansion of
de-mining programme, massive short-run employment generation
through public works programme, re-starting and expanding key
social services like education and health, with a focus of reaching
girls and women and human capacity mobilization for social
services, infrastructure and public administration.

"Afghanistan's economy in a state of collapse," says the Approach
Paper. Inflation has wiped out the value of Afghan currency in the
1990s and at present the currency is printed by the Northern
Alliance without any monetary control. The key economic
institutions of the State-central bank, treasury, tax collection
and customs, statistics, civil service, law and order and judicial
system -are extremely weak or simply missing. Basic infrastructure
-roads, bridges, irrigation, canals, telecommunications,
electricity, markets- has been destroyed or orientated towards the
war effort.

In 1978, prior to the long drawn-out war against Soviet occupation
and subsequent internecine conflict, Afghanistan was largely self-
sufficient in food and a significant exporter of agricultural
products. Agriculture was largely concentrated in narrow river
valleys and plains. Manufacturing was largely undeveloped, with
only a few plants producing textiles, cement and medicines, etc.

During the rule of former King Zahir Shah, the macro-economic
policies were balanced, with budget surpluses, a market-based
competitive exchange rate and modest foreign and domestic debt. The
country had good major road network as well as some other
infrastructure including major irrigation and hydro-electric
facilities.

In those times, the modern infrastructures did not extend beyond
the main arteries and urban centres. Social and other services like
education and health was limited to relatively small urban centres.

A three-year drought and resulting famine, the recent ban by
Taliban on opium production, the choking trade via Pakistan and the
massive displacement of population, says the Approach Paper, have
exhausted what coping capacity was left among families and civil
society after a prolonged armed conflict.

The primary education gross enrolment rate has most recently been
estimated at 39 per cent for boys and 3 per cent for girls.
Secondary and higher education, crucial to producing future skilled
professionals, presents even a bleaker future.

According to reports at a recent World Bank sponsored workshop "the
situation in health is equally grim." UN and NGOs estimate that
infant mortality in Afghanistan is the highest in the world at
around 165 per 1,000 births, while 257 infants out of every 1,000
births die before they are five. Life expectancy at birth is
estimated at 41 years of age. The country has the largest
population of disabled in the world because of direct or indirect
consequence of war. A recent WB funded study estimated that as many
as 500 persons per month fall victims to mine accidents and
unexploded ordnance.

To sum up, Afghanistan's economic structure has been gravely
weakened, distorted and made more vulnerable through two decades of
conflict. Agriculture and livestock are highly vulnerable to
natural conditions. Trading activities are vulnerable to the
policies of neighbouring countries, notably Pakistan. Remittances,
another major source of income, tend to be stable, but nevertheless
are vulnerable to changes in economic conditions in source
countries. Majority of the Afghans suffer from a pervasive sense of
insecurity.

The WB Approach Paper also points out the significant regional
spill-over effects of the Afghanistan's economic situation through
unofficial trade, narcotics, tourism, extremism, financial flows
and movements of people. And the conflict-related and conflict-
enabling economic activities and structures have been entrenched.
There are significant groups who are benefiting from the current
situation and have a vested interest in its continuation.

The background information provided by the WB paper describes
Afghanistan as landlocked, mountainous, remote, sparsely populated,
ethnically diverse and yet geopolitically important country. It has
long been the poorest country, falling near the bottom in terms of
average per-capita income and UNDP's human development index.
Afghanistan was at peace between 1930s and 1970s and underwent a
modest degree of economic and social development.

Modernization was concentrated in cities and towns. Most rural
areas retained their, traditional more, governance structures and
social practices. The Afghan state remained relatively weak and had
limited reach in most of the country. The present in-country
population is estimated at 18-20 million and if all the refugees
were to return the population would about 25 million. Currently,
about an estimated seven million people are vulnerable to famine.

Its human resource has been severely depleted and its social
capital has been eroded. State institutions are largely non-
functional, the economy and society have become fragmented.

Thus, Afghanistan faces serious political problems, a dire
humanitarian emergency in the short run and massive assistance for
reconstruction and development over time. WB considers that the
time is ripe to prepare for Afghanistan's post-conflict
reconstruction. Although it would be premature to put a price tag
on Afghanistan's reconstruction before a detailed assessment, the
WB Approach Paper says "the costs are expected to be high."

The Afghanistan's reconstruction cannot be separated from the long
term economic and social development as it would make the task of
maintaining political stability and promoting national integration
very difficult and leave Afghanistan highly vulnerable to
resurgence of conflict, the paper concludes.

</a>UNDP to provide $168m: Shaukat
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 17: The United Nations Development Program will
provide $168 million to Pakistan during 2001-2002 to support
various development programs, including poverty alleviation.

"The UNDP has doubled its annual development assistance for 
Pakistan and will extend this year $168 million," said Finance 
Minister Shaukat Aziz.

Speaking at a joint news conference with Dr Hafiz Pasha, UN
Assistant Secretary General, he said that the government of
Pakistan hailed the decision of the UN to double its annual
assistance. He said the new aid will be in the shape of grant and
utilized in various spheres but priority will be given to poverty
alleviation in the provinces.

"During my visit to Pakistan, I have observed firm commitment at 
the highest levels to pursue the long-term reform process, despite 
the present crisis in Afghanistan and impact of downturn in global 
trade and investment climate. In this context, the UN System in 
Pakistan is making special efforts to expand its current 
commitments and launch new programmes to meet the most dire needs, 
particularly in the areas most affected by the crisis," Dr Hafiz 
Pasha said.

He said during meetings with federal and provincial government
officials, there was an agreement on upscaling the UNDP program in
Pakistan in the areas of poverty alleviation, governance,
environment, disaster management and gender. Over the past five
years, the UNDP has given grants for programs totalling $84
million.

"For the next three years, we plan to more than double this 
allocation, using UNDP core funds, global thematic trust funds, 
Global Environment Facility funds, and cost-sharing with government 
and donors."

<a name="sbpl">SBP lifts foreign exchange quotas: Overseas travelling</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Nov 22: If you are travelling abroad for any purpose you
are now free to buy from the banks as much foreign exchange as you
need at the inter-bank exchange rate.

Earlier, people traveling abroad used to get a fixed quota of
foreign exchange from the inter-bank market: they could buy only
$2100 per year for private visits and $9000 per year for business
visits abroad.

The State Bank allowed the banks to sell as much foreign exchange
to people going abroad as may be needed by them. But it made it
clear that before doing so the banks should satisfy themselves
about the genuineness of the requirement of the travellers by
verifying the documentary evidences provided by them. Bankers said
in doing so, they would not need to take prior SBP permission.

The SBP made this announcement through a circular (F.E. 21). The
circular said the decision to allow liberal release of foreign
exchange to people travelling abroad was taken "with a view to
further liberalizing the foreign exchange activities."

The one-paragraph circular gave no details but bankers said the SBP
decision would enable the following categories of people to buy
foreign exchange from the inter-bank market according to their
genuine requirement:

(i) People traveling for private or business visits abroad
including government servants and employees of semi-government
institutions.

(ii) Journalists and others traveling abroad to participate in
international events.

(iii) People traveling abroad for professional training or for
Tabligh (spreading the message of Islam).

(iv) Persons proceeding abroad for medical treatment.

(v) Government/semi-government employees traveling abroad on duty
or training or on posting or retirement-and on leave. Also those
employees traveling abroad as members of some delegations.

(vi) Persons proceeding on migration abroad.

(vii) People going abroad on business visits.

(viii) Representatives of consultancy/construction companies and
firms.

(ix) Traders traveling abroad with along with sample goods and
businessmen proceeding abroad to take part in fairs and
exhibitions.

(x) Exporters as well as non-exporter business executives of firms
or companies desiring to get foreign exchange against credit cards.

(xi) Students travelling abroad to study; and

(xii) Students already staying abroad for studies would now get
foreign exchange bought from the inter-bank market and remitted to
them by their relatives or friends.

FAST LIBERALIZATION: The SBP decision to lift curbs on the sale of
foreign exchange by banks to people travelling abroad came just a
day after it had allowed the banks to buy or sell foreign exchange
between themselves without any commercial transaction on the back.
Senior bankers say the two decisions indicate that the
liberalization of foreign exchange regime is taking place much
faster than expected. What makes it possible for the State Bank to
move faster in this area is that the gap between the inter-bank and
open market exchange rates has come down from more than Rs2 per
dollar before September 11 to less than Re1 per dollar now. "The 
lesser the gap between the two exchange rates the lesser would be 
the chances of misuse (of liberal foreign exchange regime)," said a 
senior banker.

POSITIVE SIGNAL: Senior bankers say a faster-than-expected
liberalization of foreign exchange regime would serve as a positive
signal for international creditors and the investors about
Pakistan's capability to meet its external obligations.

They say sending positive signals to the investors is very much
necessary at the time when the country is striving hard to come out
of an economic slump that might deepen further in the wake of the
ongoing war in Afghanistan.

LAHORE, Nov 20: US Ambassador to Pakistan Wendy Chamberlin said
that her country was taking a firm position to end all forms of
illegal transfer of money to Pakistan, including Hundi.

Talking to reporters, she said they (the US government officials)
were working with Pakistan interior ministry officials to develop a
system to check this illegal practice.

The Pakistan government was losing revenue and taxes on remittances
due to money laundering, while the money transferred through
illegal means could also be used by terrorists and drug smugglers,
she feared.

<a name="cour">Court bars ex-BCCI man from selling property</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 21: The additional district and sessions judge,
Safdar Hussain Malik, entertaining a recovery suit of the defunct
Bank of Commerce and Credit International (BCCI), has restrained
the sponsors of a housing society from disposing of its assets
worth millions of rupees.

In a liquidation-related matter, the court restrained a former BCCI
employee from disposing of his properties, including the housing
project, spread on a 660-kanal land, and two houses in E-7,
Islamabad.

The housing scheme in sector E-16 is said to be a project of RP
Corporation, a private limited company.

Sayed Raza Ali the former BCCI employee allegedly plundered the
bank to the tune of 17 million pound sterling and purchased assets
in Islamabad and Karachi.

After the bank was liquidated on the charges of money-laundering in
January 1991, the liquidators were empowered by the London,
Luxumburg, and Cayman courts to recover the amounts from the
accused. These moves led to several judgments against the BCCI
employees, including Mr Raza.

The accused insisted before the court that he was one of the owners
of RP Corporation and not the sole proprietor of the housing
scheme. Therefore, he can not be stopped from dealing in the
affairs of the housing scheme.

The court, however, observed that the liquidators had brought
sufficient material on record that the land and the property were
acquired from the money plundered by the accused.

<a name="niza">The Nazims' nizam</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

What must be repeated endlessly, for as long as what remains of
Jinnah's Pakistan exists, and bear repetition ad infinitum is one
well known sentence from Mohammad Ali Jinnah's momentous speech -
his creed - delivered on August 11, 1947: "The first duty of a 
government is to maintain law and order so that the life, property 
and religious beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the 
state."

Now, we all know the famous section in the Pakistan Penal Code,
Section 295 (c). In 1986, the Criminal Law (Amendment Act, III) was
passed by the hand-picked pious members of champion-of-Islam
General Zia-ul-Haq's Majlis-i-Shoora headed by Mohammed Khan Junejo
and it added Section 295(C) to Section 295 of the PPC.

This is a weapon designed to be used for personal vengeance, a
weapon with which scores can be settled, a weapon to be employed
for personal gain. It reads: "Whoever by words, either spoken or 
written, or by visible representation, or by imputation, innuendo, 
or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of 
the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace by upon him) shall be punished 
with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall be liable to fine."

In April 2000, Chief Executive (as he then simply was) General
Pervez Musharraf instructed National Security Council member Attiya
Inayatullah to organize a seminar on human rights. He very
correctly there made a reference to the blasphemy laws, realizing
the criminal abuse they arouse and in an effort to prevent such
abuse he announced his intention of amending the laws so that prior
to the registration of an FIR, a deputy commissioner (now a Nazim)
would be required to make investigations as to the veracity of the
charge - a mere token change in the law but nevertheless a step in
the right direction approved by the external world and by the sane
and balanced internally. Some days later, for no good reason other
than fear, he retreated and told the nation that such an amendment
was not possible. Now, fortunately for the nation and the country,
he and his officers have far less fear of the bigots and the
religion-manipulating mischief makers. We are progressing.

Many of us know how our textile mills are harassed. They print
designs sent by their buyers abroad - Japanese, French, Chinese,
Taiwanese, American, Irish, and many others - and the mischief
making manipulators when they wish to not only extort but to make
wicked mischief manage to perceive in any design they may choose to
set their eyes upon a squiggle or a line which they interpret as
'Allah' or 'Mohammad'. They then literally terrorize the mill
owners with threats of exposure, reports to the police, the
mullahs, the authorities, etc., unless substantial sums are paid
up. These terrorists also recruit and bribe the more irresponsible
inexperienced members of our press who are wont to print alarming
reports intended to instigate and arouse the public. Remember how
some time ago, one of these 'religious' extortionists even managed
to read the word 'Allah' in the 'Nike' sign, which is plastered all
over what is worn by a large number of our public, and shown on our
hoardings and television advertisements.

The latest mill victim is Yunus Textile Mills of Landhi, owned and
managed by the brothers Yunus, their family, and shareholders. The
group owns many industries and is counted as one of the top
exporters of Pakistan.

The owners are deeply and truly religious, followers of Islam in
its correct and original form, and their philanthropy is well
known.

On October 23, Nazim Mohammad Shahid of Landhi sent a written
complaint to the senior superintendent of police of the Malir and
also informed the local Urdu press that he had heard that Yunus
Textile Mills was printing cloth with a design in which can be
detected the words 'Allah' and 'Mohammad'. According to his report
to the police, this had caused much resentment in the area and
consequent unrest among the locals. He asked that preventative
measures be immediately taken to quell the alleged but imaginary
discontent.

The Nazim then telephoned the mill and asked the manager to come to
his office and give his explanation to members of the press who had
gathered there. Before the manager could leave the mill a team of
four reporters and a photographer arrived in his office from a
local Urdu daily. They had been informed by the Nazim that
defamatory material had been printed by the mill, and that he had
made efforts to contact the mill management without success. They
alleged that the entire locality was up in arms against the outrage
and that the law and order situation was getting out of hand.

The manager told them that no such inflammatory material had ever
been printed in his mill, and that he, his workers and the owners
were God-fearing Muslims who, knowing the current trend, strictly
and conscientiously avoid printing any material which could be
deemed to be even vaguely objectionable or hurt anyone's feelings.
The press team declared they were satisfied.

As soon as they left, the representatives of the mill management
went to see the Landhi Nazim and told him what they had told the
press. The Nazim assured them that he too was satisfied and would
see that a clarification of the matter was printed in the press.

The next day, October 24, the same newspaper whose reporters had
earlier visited the mill manager's statement and also printed the
original version of the Nazim together with his photograph and
photographs of the samples of two pieces of cloth which he had
given them. The report was most provocative and was obviously made
inflammatory with intent.

On October 25, Abdul Qadir Mandokhel of Quetta claiming to be an
advocate and the chairman of the 'Mandokhel Welfare Organization'
went to see City Nazim at the KMC head office and complained to him
that Yunus Textile Mills had printed objectionable material.

Nazim Naimatullah asked Mandokhel to lodge his complaint with the
executive district officer, Syed Mahmood Shah. He did so. Mahmood
Shah, who is in charge of the promotion of industry in this city,
then organised a raiding party comprising Mandokhel, Dr Laeeq, a
medical doctor in charge of medicine quality control, Mubarak Shah,
Laeeq's deputy, Ahsan Mirza, the assistant district officer,
Inspector Sabir Sipra, the Station House Officer of the KMC police
station in charge of encroachment removals, three 'police
constables, Amir Jalai of a Urdu daily newspaper, and his
photographer, and Hafiz Abdul Rais, the Sindh representative of
Mandokhel's office. They forcibly entered the mill premises and one
of the godowns. The mill security staff resisted but were taken
care of by the uniformed policemen.

The management raised objections against the unnecessarily
stronghanded behaviour of the raiding team and suggested they sit
down and discuss the matter. The mill administrator made it quite
clear that in the contentious design there was no possible way that
the words 'Allah' or 'Mohammad' could be perceived, even by the
most twisted mind, and he gave them a sample of the cloth. The
raiders left saying they would investigate further.

During the discussions, the man Mandokhel threatened to have the
mill sealed, the culprits charged with blasphemy, and then hanged.

On October 26, Mandokhel filed FIR 390/01 in the Qaidabad police
station, on which is noted in Urdu, loosely translated here: I,
Duty Officer, Sub Inspector Zulfikar Haider, confirm that I have a
written word for word report regarding crimes which have been
committed under Sections 295 (b) and 295 (c). Therefore a case has
been filed against the mill owner of Yunus Textile Mills, Mohammad
Ali, and Director Technical Tanvir Ahmad Siddiqui and all other
persons involved in the FIR lodged for further investigation by SHO
Shujaat Hussain.

President General Musharraf and the nation have gone to war against
the world of terrorism. Must we suffer this evil at home?

<a name="thef">The fantasies of Pakistani liberalism </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

"The Afghan situation has presented a unique opportunity to draw a 
line in the sand against a tiny minority of unenlightened, 
obscurantist and backward-looking religious extremists who hold the 
majority of moderate, dynamic and futuristic-looking Pakistanis 
hostage." -General Musharraf in New York

Who's held a gun to the nation's head? It cannot be the Beards who
have never held power in the state. While they can be accused of
many things--principally of being a nuisance and of filling the
airwaves with rhetoric we could all have done without-- mismanaging
the nation's affairs is not a sin that can be laid at their door.

For this feat of endurance--ineptitude and folly spread over 50
years--the English-speaking governing elite in power since 1947 has
to carry all the blame. In Pakistan's power structure the Beards
have been outsiders. All the institutions of state--political,
military, bureaucratic, judicial--have been the exclusive preserve
of a governing class whose greatest achievements have been self-
perpetuation, corruption and an incompetence that often defies
analysis. What have the Beards to do with this record?

The Beards had no representation in the first Constituent Assembly,
so are not to be blamed for the delays in framing a constitution
which plagued the nation's early years. They did not elevate Ghulam
Muhammad to the Governor Generalship or Iskander Mirza to the
presidency. They had no hand in Ayub Khan's military coup, which
really derailed the country and set the stage for the country's
dismemberment in 1971.

It was not the Beards who led the country into the folly of the
1965 war but rather the quintessential liberal elite represented by
Ayub Khan and his coterie of advisers.

It bears asking at this point as to who is a liberal in the
Pakistani context and who a fundo? A liberal is someone who has
climbed the ladder of an English education for social and other
forms of preferment, Pakistani liberalism having nothing to do with
any intellectual tradition, much less with the Whig tradition of
British history. It is all form and no substance. Crackling
thunder, no rain.

Conversely, a fundo means someone who is (mostly) from the other
side of the tracks and seeks solace, or a solution to the world's
problems, in a literal and narrow rendering of the tenets of Islam.

What is the touchstone of the liberal credo? An end to prohibition
(something with which I agree but for different reasons). That's
about it. It's more fun being sentimental about the national
interest in a crowded bar or a club than in the enforced privacy of
one's home.

Pakistan's most famous generals--Ayub, Yahya, Niazi, etc--fought
their most successful battles on bar stools. Much as Pakistan's
bureaucrats and politicians, positively lyrical when the right
stuff flows, have rivalled the achievements of Pericles in similar
settings. Prohibition has not just been hard on the nation's
drinkers (a touchy issue with which it is possible to sympathize).
It has also ruined the tone of Pakistani metaphysics.

The fundamentalist, on the other hand, is a creature of rage. Not
because his ideology predisposes him to this attitude but because
rage, helpless anger and frustration are the typical responses of
the outsider: he who wants to be in but is not and who therefore
enjoys the luxury of denunciation without the burden of
responsibility.

It should be a sobering thought that all the debacles which stand
out in our history were the products of 'liberal' endeavour: from
the war of 1971 to the more recent adventure in Kargil. Sure, the
religious right had something to do with some of these ventures but
only as cannon fodder and foot soldiers. The actual decisions were
made over their heads by the country's 'liberal', English-speaking
establishment.

The Jamaat-I-Islami played the role of an auxiliary militia in East
Pakistan in 1971 and a leading role in the agitation against
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in 1977. Throughout the Zia era it acted as'B'
team of the military regime. Some of the religious outfits were
deeply involved in the first Afghan 'jehad' against the Soviet
occupation. But in all these ventures the religious right was
playing out roles scripted and directed by General Headquarters or
Inter-Services Intelligence. While the religious parties and,
later, the madrassas proved useful to the state, they were never
the state.

How strange then that today they should be demonized as the source
of all our problems. Who held whom hostage? It was not the
madrassas which forced any government to support the Taliban. This
was a decision taken by the national security establishment in
pursuit of 'strategic depth' and similar notions which have
characterised our Afghan policy. The madrassas had it not in their
power to hold the nation hostage. It was the army and the
intelligence services which brooked no assault on the "obscurantist
elements" because they were seen as serving the 'national
interest'--a bogey in whose name every last lunacy can be
justified.

Of course after the change of political climate in Pakistan it is
near-treason to suggest that prior to September 11 General
Musharraf subscribed to the same philosophy he now so stoutly
berates. His own words on numerous occasions testify to the fact
that on Afghanistan, Kashmir and the great strategic space provided
to Pakistan by its nuclear capability his views were no different
from that of the Beards. Both sides, the army and the Beards, swore
by the same strategic orthodoxy (this adjective, strategic,
deserving close examination for all the mischief it has caused).

It goes to General Musharraf's credit that he changed his mind
quickly when circumstances changed. Consistency, after all, as
Mullah Omar might reflect, is not a virtue at all times. Even so,
he could try putting Pakistan's peculiar brand of obscurantism in
perspective. When the very bastions of national security are
infected by the spirit of holy war, does obscurantism reside in the
madrassas or in the bastions standing guard against the enemy?

So there we have it. Pakistan's problem lies not amongst its
bearded population or in the obscure curriculum taught in its
religious seminaries. If it did, the solution would be simple:
bulldozing the madrassas and perhaps press-ganging their students
into the army. The problem lies elsewhere: not in the minds
supposedly chained to the past but in the 'liberal' establishment
which has always prided itself on having its eyes on the future.

The best that this establishment produced has served Pakistan ill:
taking it into useless defence pacts (SEATO and CENTO), fighting
useless wars, making the country hostage to one futile ambition
after another. The madrassas and the Beards while responding
emotionally to many senseless ideas have had no part in creating
this sorry legacy.

Even now, we are clutching at the wrong end of the argument. Our
problem is not joining or staying out of the international
mainstream, the great clichi spawned by our decision to join the
American war on Afghanistan. For most of our 53 years as a nation
we were amongst the most allied of America's allies and thus in the
very centre of the international mainstream. What good did that do
us? The Beards had not arrived on the national scene by then. It
was the old governing class--crack English, premium whisky (alas)
and all--which made a mess of the nation's affairs.

Know thyself is a maxim applicable as much to nations as to
individuals seeking to find a way out of their distress. It is not
the elimination of the Beards which is our foremost problem but the
eradication of obscurantism from the hearts and minds of the
national security establishment.

If the attention showered on Pakistan becomes another instrument
for self-perpetuation, and for the lengthening of the Musharraf
order, then Pakistan has gained nothing from this crisis. With the
fall of Kabul and other cities our importance as a frontline state
has already gone. The rest of the bubble will also burst because
bubbles never last. Only if the army pursues a Kemalist agenda and
sets the country on the path to an enduring democracy will we be
able to say that we took the right turning and exploited the
situation to our advantage.

But for this to happen and for us to start on this journey, the
first essential is to stop pretending that the Beards and madrassas
have been the source of our problems.

<a name="hist">History's hard lessons</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

If I were to get a dollar for every lesson Muslim leaders had
failed to learn over the years, I would be a rich man today.

Time and again in Islamic history, leaders have refused to draw the
obvious conclusions from events and their subjects have paid a
heavy price for their stupidity. But instead of penalizing their
rulers, they have blamed everybody else but those directly
responsible for their misfortunes.

This gullibility among the ruled, combined with the cynicism of
their rulers, has produced a seemingly unending series of man-made
and entirely avoidable disasters spanning centuries that led
inexorably to the Gulf War a decade ago, as well as the current
situation in Afghanistan.

One problem of course is that Muslim societies have traditionally
been ruled by despots who have surrounded themselves with
sycophants. Even today, democracies in the Islamic world can be
counted on the fingers of one hand. Under such autocratic rule,
decision-making is usually highly personalized and hence whimsical.

This leadership style leads to the selection of unqualified and
unsuitable individuals for the top slots in the bureaucracy as well
as the defence forces. When nepotism is rampant, talent and
intelligence are discounted; officers picked for their family ties
and personal loyalty are unlikely to offer independent advice that
may be unpopular with their patron.

You do not have to be a management guru to see that this
administrative model is a recipe for disaster, and so it has proved
to be for centuries. Although this system also prevailed in the
West, it was discarded in favour of democracy and meritocracy which
were found to be much more efficient and flexible in running modern
societies and economies.

Yet Muslim states have copied only the trappings of democracy,
rarely its essence. Arab countries hold farcical one-party
elections in which the dictator of the day wins a 99 per cent
majority, leaving outsiders wondering about the fate of the
dissenting one per cent.

When personal preferences and prejudices rule the destiny of
millions, institutions cannot develop and flourish. Leaders like
the Colonel Qadhafi can bankrupt his oil-rich, under-populated
nation, subject his people to repression for three decades, and
still be admired by Muslims across the world. Saddam Hussein can
invade Iran without provocation and fight a bloody war that bled
both nations white over ten years without protest from the Islamic
world. Then the same tyrant can invade Kuwait, triggering the Gulf
War and the subsequent sanctions that have devastated his country,
and still be regarded a hero from Morocco to Malaysia.
Incidentally, he runs one of the most vicious police states in the
world, but one doesn't hear of Muslims demonstrating against him.

Another case in point is the on-going American bombing in
Afghanistan. Here is one of the poorest countries in the world,
ravaged by years of invasion, civil war and drought , but
nonetheless takes on the most powerful state the world has ever
seen. Had the Afghan cause been just, this defiance would have
evoked our admiration and sympathy.

However, all this death and destruction has been invited for the
sake of Osama bin Laden, a terrorist who did not have the courage
to either give himself up or commit suicide to save his hosts from
the devastation they are now being subjected to. At school, it was
considered honourable to step forward and accept one's medicine
like a man when the entire class was threatened with collective
punishment if the guilty party did not confess to his crime. But in
this case, bin Laden too has joined the pantheon of heroes of the
Islamic world.

One problem with all three examples given here is that very few of 
our despots understand the realities of power in the modern world. 
In a recent article called "It's the daisy-cutter, stupid!", Kamran 
Shafi made the point that the Taliban had been routed by the sheer 
weight of the firepower unleashed on them by the Americans. While 
this is obvious to most of us, there are still many Muslims here 
and elsewhere who feel it is somehow 'cowardly' for the Americans 
not to commit their ground troops to fight the Taliban, relying 
instead on cruise missiles and B-52s.

Indeed, our ex-spymaster, the (mercifully) retired General Hameed 
Gul, referred to American troops as "cream puff soldiers." What 
these latter-day Saladins fail to understand is that military 
strategy has changed with the induction of the new technologies, 
and it would be irresponsible for a modern commander to risk his 
soldiers where he can get the same job done by planes flying at 
20,000 feet above the ground. Both Saddam Hussein and Mullah Omar 
are too ignorant of these realities to comprehend that they simply 
cannot withstand the storm of steel and fire a modern superpower 
can unleash.

Ignorance is at the root of Muslim weakness and decline today. 
There exists a fundamental contradiction between the dictates of 
despotism and those of modernism: Muslim rulers risk being unseated 
if their subjects are educated in the modern sense of the word. 
Hence they are willing to accept and even encourage the setting up 
of madressahs where only the scriptures are taught. 

However, even where modern institutions have been established, 
students are not encouraged to question and criticize the status 
quo. although some of them have been the centres of protest, they 
are not centres of creative research: for this, students have to go 
to western universities. 

Thus, the Muslim world has lost some of its finest minds as it 
cannot furnish them with the tools or the intellectual environment 
they need. This brain-drain in turn feeds into the stagnation and 
torpor that characterize the Muslim world today.

Even in a country like Pakistan where, thanks to its colonial 
heritage, there is a constant demand for democracy despite its 
repeated bouts of military rule, there is a sizable section of the 
population that is out of touch with reality. 

Even educated people (or specially educated people) view modernity 
and secularism with grave suspicion. They seek to make a clear 
distinction between their faith and what they see as western 
values. For them, reason and rationality are in conflict with the 
fundamentals of religion. 

Indeed, if they take the scriptures literally, they may well be 
right.

But even in secular Muslim countries like Iraq and Libya, despotism 
has marginalized and isolated them to the point where, despite 
their vast oil wealth, they are totally irrelevant to world 
affairs. Until Muslim societies can resolve all their many 
contradictions and learn the lessons they have ignored for 
centuries, they will deserve to be left behind as they rail against 
the injustice of history and the march of progress.

RAWALPINDI, Nov 21: Medium-pacers Junaid Zia and Kamran Sajid
shared six wickets to help Young Pakistan to an easy six-wicket
victory against the touring Sir Lankan Juniors in the second one-
day International at the Rawalpindi Stadium.

The bowling, backed by sharp fielding, made things quite easy for
the home team as they dismissed the tourists for 133 in 44 overs,
and then overhauled that total in 28.1 overs, scoring 136 for four.

The victory put Pakistan 2-0 up in the five match series with a
game in Sheikupura and two in Lahore still to go.

The only scar on what was otherwise a remarkable victory was a
catch taken at mid wicket by Muhammad Fayyaz of Sri Lankan opener
S. Perera. While television replays clearly showed that he had
floored the catch off a Junaid Zia delivery, Fayyaz pretended as if
he had taken it cleanly.

Umpires ZI Pasha and Iqbal Butt could not make out if it was a
clean one but they did not seem to have much doubts initially as
the batsman himself quickly left the crease. The catch stood and
the unlucky opener trudged back after scoring 19 runs.

Pakistan coach Haroon Rasheed told Dawn that Fayyaz got confused as
his team-mates quickly rushed in to celebrate. He agreed though
that it was the only black mark in a wonderful day's work.

After Sri Lanka had been put in by home skipper Salman Butt, the
visitors could not cope with the accurate line and length of the
Pakistan pace trio comprising Junaid, Kamran and Najaf Shah. Only
P. Ranawake in the middle order with 23 from 49 balls was the top
run-getter while his mates could not impress much.

Junaid finished with the figures of figures of 3-34 off nine overs
two of which were maiden. Kamran on the other hand bowled five
maidens in his quota of ten overs and conceded only 32 runs for
three wickets. Najaf was good with the ball too snapping up two
wickets for 29 runs.

For their fine efforts, both Junaid and Kamran were declared joint
winners of the Man of the Match award.

When Pakistan began the chase, Salman fell cheaply for five and
then Khaqan Arsal (16) went with the Pakistan total standing at 35.
Opener Saqib Zia scored a patient 28 off 51 balls before falling to
medium fast N. Des Wijeratne who had him caught by P. Ranawake and
then Kamran Sajid couldn't do much and was dismissed for just 9.

At 70 for four the Sri Lankans seemed to be coming back but then
Asim Munir Butt with an unbeaten 37 and Muhammad Fayyaz who struck
a brisk 28 not out made sure things do not get out of hand.

Left arm medium fast bowler N Des Wijeratne took the wickethonours
for the Sri Lankans with three for 32.

<a name="open">Pakistan Open in March</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 21: The prestigious Pakistan Open, postponed last
September, has been rescheduled for March 9-17 next year at Lahore.

The meeting, chaired by the president of PSF, Air Chief Marshal
Mushaf Ali Mir, besides finalising the dates of the tournament,
enhanced its prize money from US $80,000 to $100,000.

Secretary of the PSF Sqd. Ldr Sajid Waheed said the federation was
now planning to buy a portable four-side glass wall court for the
Pakistan Open. The Open, had to be put back following the terror
that struck the US on September 11 which led to the foreign players
refusing to travel down to Pakistan for the tournament.

Sajid said that the new dates were chosen carefully as March was
thought to be the best time for the event which will be organised
by the Punjab Squash Association.

The house re-elected Jahangir Khan as the vice president of PSF for
a second term of three years and deliberated at length about
holding the elections of the provincial associations. In the light
of the new sports policy, the squash bosses decided that Punjab,
Sindh, NWFP and Balochistan hold their elections before the
deadlines set for them.

The sports policy will bring to an end the tenures of Qamar Zaman
and Muhammad Ali Jogazai as secretaries of the provincial
associations of NWFP and Balochistan respectively.

Rehmat Khan, who coached the legendary Jahangir to stardom, would
continue to train the junior players. However, a decision on
coaches for the seniors would be taken in due course, Sajid said.

A proposal was approved whereby the affiliated members of the PSF
would sponsor four players for the National Games.

A committee, with one representative each from the Armed Forces and
the secretary himself, was formed to finalise the national and
international calendars for the year 2002.

The importance of women's squash also came up for discussion with
the president emphasising the need for associations to concentrate
on training women players and holding tournaments for them so that
a competitive environment could be created within the provinces.

<a name="khaq">Khaqan and Salman dominate Pakistan's impressive victory</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Nov 18: Khaqan Arsal and skipper Salman Butt hit sparkling
unbeaten half-centuries as Pakistan thrashed Sri Lanka by nine
wickets in the opening Under-19 One-day International at National
Stadium.

Sri Lanka Under-19 were restricted to 198 for nine in their 50
overs after their captain Dhammika Niroshan won the toss and
elected to bat first.

Pakistan Under-19, in reply, reached the target for the loss of
opener Kamran Younis by scoring 202 for one in 43.5 overs.

Right-hander Khaqan smashed 93 not out off 107 balls with 15 fours
while left-handed Salman hit an enterprising 82 off 115 deliveries
with 10 hits to the ropes during the unbroken 136-run second wicket
stand.

Earlier, some fine tidy bowling and superb fielding by Pakistan
teenagers caused the slide in Sri Lankan batting ranks as five of
their batsman were run out which compounded their problems.

Sri Lankans slumped to 34 for three after promising paceman Umer
Gul had opener Upul Tharanga caught behind by Zulqarnain for 17.
Mevan Dunusinghe fell to Junaid Zia for four and four balls later
Sahan Wijeratne was run out for a duck.

Sumal Perera and Jeevan Mendis added 58 for the fourth wicket.
Perera was bowled by left-arm spinner Kamran Younis for 37.

Jeevan with Farveez Mahroof added another 56 for the sixth wicket
to retrieve the situation but once the partnership was broken the
remaining batting fell away.

Left-hander Mendis top-scored for the touring side with a defiant
56 off 91 balls. He hit three fours and a six.

Umer Gul and off-spinner Irfanuddin were the pick of home side
bowling attack. Umer took one for 28 in 10 overs and Irfan captured
one for 24 in his 10 overs. -APP

LAHORE, Nov 19: Pakistan will be the candidate of hosting the
Senior and Junior World Cup hockey tournaments and the 25th
Champions Trophy. The Senior World Cup is scheduled be held in 2006
and the junior in 2005.

The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) secretary Brig. Mussaratullah
Khan told journalists that Pakistan will present its case in the
FIH Executive Board meeting to be held at Brussels (Belgium) on Nov
29.

He said that Pakistan would fight for the 25th Champions Trophy as
an alternative of the 23rd edition which was held at Rotterdam
(Holland) this month after shifting from Pakistan due to security
reasons in the region.

He said that according to the FIH decision Pakistan had the
opportunity to hold Champions Trophy after every two years.
Following this rule Pakistan would be awarded the 26th edition, but
the PHF was interested to get the silver jubilee year tournament in
place of 23rd Champions Trophy.

<a name="pcbr">PCB requests CBFS to reschedule tournament</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 20: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has urged the
Cricketers Benefit Fund Series (CBFS) to reschedule April's Sharjah
Cup so that it can host New Zealand. Pakistan, Sri Lanka and New
Zealand are slated to appear in the April tournament.

A PCB official confirmed that the CBFS has been requested to
organize the April tournament in March so that New Zealand's
cancelled tour to Pakistan can be reprogrammed in April and May.

"YES, WE HAVE REQUESTED THE CBFS TO LOOK INTO THIS PROPOSAL. IF ALL
GOES WELL, WE MIGHT HOST NEW ZEALAND FOR THREE TESTS AND AS MANY
ONE-DAY INTERNATIONALS IN APRIL AND EARLY MAY," chairman of the PCB
Lt Gen Tauqir Zia said from Rawalpindi.

If CBFS succeeds to convince New Zealand Cricket (NZC) on fresh
Sharjah Cup dates, India stands a 60-40 chance to replace the Black
Caps and end their three-year ban on playing cricket at "NON-
REGULAR VENUES" by making their first appearance since October
2000.

Also in the fray are the West Indies as the Caribbean players would
have just concluded their series in Pakistan and can appear in the
desert city on their way home where they take on India.

The Sharjah tournament is planned between April 10 and 19 while New
Zealand conclude their home series against England on April 3.

"If CBFS and NZC agree, New Zealand can come to Pakistan 
immediately after their series against England and wind up their 
assignment in Pakistan by the first week of May.

The PCB chairman further argued that if New Zealand came in July-
August, the contracts of three Pakistan players and a Black Cap 
player in English county championships might be affected.

Shahid Afridi is signed with Leicestershire, Abdur Razzaq with 
Middlesex and Saqlain Mushtaq with Surrey while Chris Cairns has 
commitments with Nottinghamshire.

<a name="shoa">Shoaib not yet exonerated</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SPORTS REPORTER

KARACHI, Nov 20: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said it would 
fight Shoaib Akhtar's case all the way but made it clear that it 
would not allow the paceman to bring the game into disrepute.

"We will continue to fight medical battle for Shoaib with the 
International Cricket Council (ICC). But at the same time, it isn't 
correct that Shoaib has been exonerated of misconduct charges," PCB 
chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia said.

Tauqir said he hasn't received disciplinary committee's 
recommendations against Shoaib. He admitted that match referee 
Denis Lindsay had not taken note of the misconduct but clarified 
that the PCB was looking above the incident.

"We have excellent relations with the Sri Lankan board. The players
have good relations with Sri Lankan players. But Shoaib's conduct
was unacceptable and could have spoiled everything.

We have special relations with Sri Lankan board who came forward to
help us when we needed them. The PCB doesn't want that its players
dent player-to-player or relations between two boards.

"Shoaib has apologized to the fans and to Mahela Jayawardena. But 
the case isn't over as yet. I have to see the findings and 
recommendations of the disciplinary committee before announcing the 
decision," Tauqir said.

Clarifying the medical battle, Tauqir said he was bemused that 
Shoaib was handled as a commoner. "For example, Muthiah 
Muralitharan and Shoaib played in the same match. The two have been 
cleared by the same Western Australia university. But only Shoaib 
has been reported.

"If the ICC says Muralitharan's case was old, then let it open
previous books. The PCB will continue to fight the case until the
ICC spells out its policies."

The PCB boss said he had great respect for Michael Holding and 
dismissed impressions that he was against his visit to Pakistan. 
"In fact, I wanted him in the past to help the academy boys. I know 
if Holding comes now, he will not only assist Shoaib but many other 
fast bowlers. "But my contention is that if Dennis Lillee has 
cleared Shoaib, why doesn't the ICC recognize it. After all, Lillee 
enjoys the same reputation as Holding."

Tauqir agreed that accepting Holding as Shoaib's bowling adviser 
would help the fast bowler, "but at the same time it would mount 
that I have accepted ICC's decision to invoke Stage Two. Besides, 
there is no guarantee that Shoaib would not be reported again if 
Holding clears his bowling action."

<a name="moni">Pakistan monitoring controversy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 20: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) were closely
monitoring the controversy involving Sachin Tendulkar who was
Tuesday found guilty of ball-tampering.

While the Pakistan authorities restrained from commenting on the
issue, sources confirmed that if the International Cricket Council
(ICC) kept in abeyance the ban on Tendulkar, the PCB would raise
the issue of Waqar Younis.

The Pakistan captain was fined 50 per cent of his match fee and
banned from a one-day international last year in Sri Lanka by New
Zealand's John Reid.

Sources, said the PCB would review the footage of Tendulkar's
incident and will then compare it with Waqar Younis' episode to
examine the similarities. "And if the incidents are identical, the 
PCB will press for the ICC to scrap the punishment on Waqar off the 
record books," sources said.

Although the ICC cannot reverse the one-man ban on Waqar, the least
it can do is to remove the stigma against the name of the champion
fast bowler who has been a scourge for the batsmen throughout his
career.

The only official reaction from the PCB on the controversy was that
it repeated its call for best match referees and umpires from all
the Test playing countries rather than ICC's decision to have a
select group of officials.

<a name="pcba">PCB and BCCI discuss saga </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 21: The Sachin Tendulkar saga has apparently brought
India and Pakistan cricket authorities closer when heads of the two
boards exchanged views on the controversy.

According to highly places sources, Board of Control for Cricket in
India (BCCI) president Jaghmohan Dalmiya wrote a formal letter to
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia.

Sources further said Dalmiya, a former International Cricket
Council (ICC) president, also made a personal telephone call to
Tauqir and deliberated on the subject.

Although no official version was made available from Pakistan
cricket authorities, sources said the BCCI has sought Pakistan's
help to overcome the crisis which India believes is targeted
against the Asian block.

Dalmiya, it is believed, has also written a similar letter to Board 
of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL).

The Asian block has suffered largely due to the biased and 
unaccommodating attitude of the ICC officials.

Muthiah Muralitharan, Waqar Younis, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Shoaib Akhtar 
have previously faced ICC wraths before Tendulkar and five other 
Indian players were targeted at Port Elizabeth.

"Dalmiya has expressed concerns that if the rules of the game were 
similar, why were only Asian cricketers being penalized. He has 
also argued that no player from Australia, England or South Africa 
has either been suspended or reprimanded despite breaching the code 
of conduct time and again," sources said.

The Pakistan cricket authorities, who enjoy excellent relations 
with their counterparts, have promised full support and have 
proposed Dalmiya to chalk out a counter-strategy, sources said.

Sources added that while Dalmiya has asked Pakistan's support on 
Tendulkar affair, in response he has assured backing to Tauqir in 
getting Shoaib Akhtar cleared from the charges of suspect bowling 
action.
