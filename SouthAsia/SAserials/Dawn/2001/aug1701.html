<a name="gene">General election in October next year, power transfer in Nov</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14: President Gen Pervez Musharraf unveiled a 
roadmap for the restoration of democracy, under which elections to 
the national, provincial and the senate would be held in October 
2002.

The election process, which will be completed in four phases, will 
also incorporate several amendments to the Constitution. Speaking 
at the gathering of newly-elected Nazims and Naib Nazims at the 
Convention Centre, the president said the election process would be 
completed through a "strategic plan" within the parameters provided 
by the Supreme Court.

No exact date was given by the president for National and 
provincial assemblies elections. "These elections will be held 
between October 1 to October 11, 2002," he said. "Today I have 
fulfilled one of my major promises to hold elections within the 
timeframe given by the Supreme Court," he stated.

Although the president did not specifically point out the 
constitutional amendments in his speech it is widely expected that 
the Eighth Constitutional Amendment would be restored with a 
provision that instead of the president dissolving the entire 
National Assembly, the Leader of the House (prime minister) could 
be dismissed for saving the system.

Giving details of his plan, Gen Musharraf said the first phase 
towards restoration of democracy has been completed with the 
installation of district governments which have become functional 
from today. During the second phase, he said, which starts from 
Sept 1, 2001 and ends on June 30, 2002, the constitution of 
Election Commission and commencement of delimitation of 
constituencies would be finalized by October this year. The 
finalization of proposed constitutional amendments to introduce 
checks and balances and their release for public analyses/comments 
would be completed by May 2002.

The announcement of constitutional amendments and completion of 
electoral rolls and delimitation of constituencies will be 
finalized by June 30, 2002. During the third phase, Gen Musharraf 
said, exact dates would be announced on July 10-11, 2002 for 
general elections to the national, provincial assemblies and 
senate. On Aug 1, 2002, the Election Commission will notify the 
election schedule. Filing of the nomination papers and their 
scrutiny, publication of the final list of candidates, allotment of 
symbols, printing of ballot papers, nomination of returning 
officers and designation of polling stations will be announced on 
Aug 7, 2002.

He said transfer of power to the elected represented would be 
completed between October and November 2002 during which oath-
taking of the elected members of the national, provincial 
assemblies and senate, election of the speaker and deputy speakers 
of the assemblies and chairman and deputy chairman of Senate and 
the formation of federal and provincial governments will be 
completed.

During this period the federal and provincial governments will be 
formed followed by address of the president to the joint session of 
the parliament. 

Gen Musharraf hoped that the setting-up of district governments at 
the grass roots level and the completion of the general elections 
in October next year would establish true democracy in the country. 
However, he warned that there would be strong checks and balances 
to ensure that the new system worked to the satisfaction of the all 
the people of Pakistan. He said that new system would discourage 
corruption.

He pointed out that on October 12, 1999 the present government 
found a situation where most institutions of state were either 
dysfunctional or were on the verge of collapse. Democracy had 
regressed into autocracy: dissent even within the ruling party had 
been prohibited by law; Centre's rule imposed on a province by 
misusing emergency powers; and the Supreme Court had been subjected 
to physical assault.

The economy, he said, was in a state of virtual collapse and the 
investors' confidence stood shattered due to freezing of foreign 
currency accounts. Also taxation and accountability authority had 
been misused and massive loans were written off and defaults 
condoned, he added.

<a name="arti">Article 58(2)(b) to be restored</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14: The government will restore Article 58(2)(b), 
giving powers to the president to dissolve the National Assembly 
and dismiss the government on the recommendations of the Security 
Council.

Officials assigned the task of drafting the constitutional 
amendments, to be introduced by June 30, 2002, told Dawn that the 
amendments would be within the framework of the mandate given by 
the Supreme Court in its judgment, validating military takeover.

The Supreme Court, while granting powers to the chief executive to 
amend the Constitution, had directed him not to make any amendment 
in derogation of the federal structure of Pakistan, parliamentary 
form of government, independence of judiciary and Islamic 
provisions of the Constitution.

The power to appoint services chiefs will again be given to the 
president to restore balance of power. The power to appoint 
services chief had been with the president since the restoration of 
democracy in 1985. However, it was taken back by former prime 
minister Nawaz Sharif through the 13th Amendment.

Restoring Article 58(2) will not offend the judiciary as in its 
judgement (Mehmood Khan Achakzai case), the apex court had termed 
the said amendment a "safety valve".

The discretionary powers under 58(2)(b) were first used by Gen 
Ziaul Haq in 1988 to remove Mohammed Khan Junejo. President Ghulam 
Ishaq Khan used this article on two occasions, once against the PPP 
and second against the PML. President Farooq Leghari dismissed the 
same political party which brought him to the President House. 

The military government will also equip the president to dismiss 
the government only, giving the same assembly another chance to 
elect a new leader of the house.

The president will use these powers in consultation with the 
Security Council, consisting of seven members. Three services 
chiefs will be the members of the Security Council by virtue of 
their offices, and the remaining four civilians will be those "who 
can take dispassionate view of the situation." The method of 
appointment for the civilian members will be spelled out in the 
constitutional package. The government, sources said, wanted that 
power should not concentrate in the hands of an individual, who 
could use it on his personal whims.

<a name="paki">Pakistan back on rails, says President</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14: President General Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan 
is back on the rails and it can now look forward for a better 
future without sword of economic catastrophe dangling over it.

"I feel that Pakistan is back on the rails. It is not me alone who 
feels this but businessmen and industrialists also share this view 
and it is confirmed by foreign economic experts. This is not a 
small achievement," Musharraf said while addressing a colourful 
flag-hoisting ceremony in front of the President House to mark the 
55th Independence Day of Pakistan.

"Apparently, we are in the gulf of despair and hopelessness. But 
something tells me that bold spirit is not dead at all." I am 
thankful to Allah Almighty for providing me with the opportunity to 
lead the process of rebuilding Pakistan with the help of my 
dedicated colleagues and with the support of the people of 
Pakistan.

"We have overcome innumerable hurdles to a considerable extent. But 
our troubles are not yet over. We will have to work hard to 
overcome them. We are back on the road to recovery." He said 
revival of the economy was the main focus of his government, adding 
the government had done a lot to retrieve the economy from 
shambles. He also thanked the friendly countries for extending 
helping a hand to Pakistan in this hour of need.

The President said the government had decided to keep reducing the 
borrowing from abroad. "We have been quite successful in bringing 
down the day-to-day expenses of the federal and provincial 
governments." The government, he said, had even frozen the defence 
allocations which, considering the situation on the borders, was no 
mean achievement.

"This was made possible because of the desire of the armed forces 
to contribute to the national economic development and their 
professional capabilities to adjust to the change without lowering 
their guards." General Musharraf recalled that the Government had 
upheld its promise to hold local government elections under the 
devolution of power plan.

He said strong criticism was made on this plan and "pages after 
pages were written on the certain failure of this system." However, 
he said, the people of Pakistan had turned up in an unprecedented 
number to cast their votes and political parties which described it 
as a poison for the provincial autonomy felt obliged to participate 
in these elections in their own way. He hoped that the this new 
form of the government mandated by the people themselves would 
prove a boon for the democracy.

The President said the process of election would be carried forward 
for provincial and national assemblies as well in a similar 
transparent manner. Earlier, General Musharraf hoisted the national 
flag. The entire nation joined him in reciting the national anthem. 
The colourful flag hoisting ceremony was largely attended by the 
people from all walks of life.-APP

<a name="numb">Number of Assemblies seats may be increased</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

LAHORE, Aug 16: The population census held in March 1998 has put 
the government under a legal obligation to increase the number of 
seats in the national and provincial assemblies. Besides, a fresh 
delimitation of constituencies by the Election Commission of 
Pakistan also comes under the same liability as is provided by the 
Delimitation of Constituencies Act of 1974.

Laying a general principle for delimitation of constituencies, 
Section 9 of the Act says that "all constituencies for Muslim seats 
shall, as far as possible, be delimited having regard to the 
distribution of population, including non-Muslims, in 
geographically compact areas, existing boundaries of administrative 
units, facilities of communication and public convenience and other 
cognate factors, to ensure homogeneity in the creation of 
constituencies; laying emphasis on the equality of population in 
constituencies of the same assembly, as far as possible."

The Commission has started preliminary preparations to carry out 
the job of demarcations of the National Assembly and provincial 
assemblies constituencies and it will give the task a formal shape 
once they are reconstituted. At present the Commission only has its 
chairman, Justice (retd) Abdul Qadeer Chaudhry, and its two members 
are to be appointed to complete its formation.

The reconstitution of the Election Commission of Pakistan is part 
of the all important second phase towards the restoration of a 
democratic order in the country as announced by President Gen 
Pervez Musharraf in his Independence Day speech.

Official sources hope that the three-member Commission will be 
completed within the month of September. As for the task of 
delimiting constituencies, the sources say the Commission has all 
the necessary data and material required for the job. The 
Commission is possessed with maps of the NA and PA constituencies 
on the basis of which the elections of 1997 were conducted.

According to sources, the Commission has enough sources to execute 
the work of delimitation on its own. But in case help is needed, it 
will ask the newly-formed district governments for that. 
Previously, the Commission used to seek the help of deputy 
commissioners and now it may be the district coordination officers 
to do the job for the Commission, if at all the Commission felt for 
outside cooperation.

As for increasing the number of seats in the legislatures, sources 
say that they will be decided by the government but since there is 
an increase in the population and the age of voter has also been 
lowered from 21 to 18 years, their number has to be increased.

The government is also believed to be considering to follow the 
pattern of local councils for reintroducing reserved seats for 
women in more or less the same proportion. Local councils have 33 
per cent seats reserved for women.

Another proposal under consideration is that members of the 
national and provincial assemblies should have enough qualification 
to understand legislative work and other parliamentary practices.

<a name="ardr">ARD rejects Musharraf's democracy roadmap</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Aug 16: Rejecting President Gen Pervez Musharraf's schedule 
for general elections as unnecessarily stretched, the Alliance for 
Restoration of Democracy demanded the formation of a caretaker 
government of national complexion and an autonomous and independent 
Election Commission to hold elections "without delay".

At an emergency meeting held under the chairmanship of Nawabzada 
Nasrullah Khan, the 16-party coalition demanded that the ban on 
political activities should be lifted forthwith and the government 
should declare in unambiguous terms that the elections would be 
held on party basis. The alliance also sought withdrawal of 
magisterial powers given to the police and dissolution of the 
National Security Council.

The ARD refused to accept President Musharraf's right to amend the 
constitution, a verdict of the Supreme Court on the subject 
notwithstanding. Briefing reporters at the residence of PPP leader 
Mian Misbahur Rahman, the venue of the meeting, the Nawabzada said 
it was unfair to allocate full nine months for preparation of 
electoral rolls and delimitations. He said the local elections had 
been held on the basis of updated electoral rolls. There was, 
therefore, no need to waste time on the same exercise.

"This (plan) simply shows that the rulers want to extend their 
tenure on one pretext or the other". Referring to the president's 
intentions to amend the constitution, he said all political parties 
and bar associations were unanimous in declaring that no individual 
had the right to amend the basic law. As for the argument that the 
Supreme Court had empowered the general to incorporate necessary 
amendments, the Nawabzada said since the apex court itself did not 
have such a power, it could not delegate it to anybody.

He insisted that only an elected parliament could amend the 
constitution, and that too in a manner provided for by the 
constitution itself.

Warning the rulers against any attempt to tinker with the 
constitution, the Nawabzada said already anti-federation forces 
were calling for the abolition of the 1973 constitution. He said 
everybody should bear in mind that in the prevailing circumstances 
it would not be possible for anybody to frame a new constitution.

He alleged that intelligence agencies had played an active role in 
the recent local elections. Local elections, he also said, were 
essentially a provincial subject. Holding these polls under the 
Election Commission of Pakistan, therefore, had been a violation of 
the constitution. He said the ARD did not mean to deny the 
importance of local bodies but local elections had nothing to do 
with transfer of power.

The ARD president said delegation of magisterial powers to the 
police was wrong and must be immediately rescinded. Replying to a 
question, the Nawabzada said the ARD did not have a monopoly of 
struggle for democracy. Other parties wishing to play their role, 
he said, were welcome to join it.

<a name="anpd">ANP dismisses roadmap for democracy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Aug 15: Awami National Party urged the government to 
announce immediate elections instead of holding them next year, and 
leave the issue of constitutional amendments to parliament.

"Why should we wait till the last date given in the Supreme Court 
judgment? If elections are possible for the local bodies now, then 
why do we have to wait until next year for general elections?" ANP 
president Asfandyar Wali Khan told Dawn. Commenting on the roadmap 
for democracy announced by President Gen Pervez Musharraf, Khan 
said: "The maximum time that the government needs for holding 
general elections is 90 days. The roadmap for democracy is vague."

The ANP chief questioned the authority of the Election Commission. 
"Allegations made during the recent local bodies elections have 
reinforced the demand for an autonomous and financially independent 
election commission. It is imperative that the next general 
elections are held under an autonomous and financially independent 
election commission, otherwise results would be questioned in the 
same manner as they have been after the local bodies elections."

The ANP president wondered as to what was the use of going for 
constitutional amendments before elections when these would have to 
go parliament and approved by the elected representatives.

Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 16: President of the Pakistan Muslim League (like- 
minded) Mian Azhar has summoned a two-day meeting of the central 
working committee at the party's central secretariat here on Aug 
25, according to a press release issued here.

Although agenda was not revealed, party sources said the meeting 
was likely to discuss the situation after the president's 
announcement of the roadmap for democracy. But, an insider said, 
the most important point to be discussed at the meeting would be a 
reunification with the Nawaz faction of the League.

Proposals in this regard had been put forth by a two-member 
reconciliation committee, comprising Illahi Bakhsh Soomro and 
Sartaj Aziz, during a recent meeting with senior League leader, 
Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain, the source said.

The like-minded group, the source said, had demanded that the other 
faction should recognize the party election through which Mian 
Azhar had been elected president. The party might consider 
possibilities of entering into electoral alliance with other 
political parties, the source added.

<a name="mush">Musharraf, Vajpayee NY talks ruled out</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Aug 16: A meeting between President Gen Pervez Musharraf 
and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee "is not on the 
cards" in New York next month but that can take place in Pakistan 
before the year-end, foreign ministry spokesman Riaz M. Khan said.

There was much speculation and a surfeit of press reports 
suggesting that the President and the Prime Minister might hold 
informal talks on the sidelines of the General Assembly meeting in 
New York in September, amid a perceptible rise in tension between 
New Delhi and Islamabad.

Responding to questions at a news briefing, the foreign office 
spokesman said Indian Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee had accepted the 
formal invitation to visit Pakistan for a summit meeting with 
President Musharraf, although the date and venue were yet to be 
set.

He refrained from making a direct comment on the recent statement 
in parliament by the Indian PM accusing Pakistan of sponsoring 
"cross-border terrorism" in the occupied Jammu and Kashmir, but 
recalled President Musharraf's "comprehensive statement" on Aug 14, 
reiterating Pakistan's desire to continue talks with India.

Pakistan was committed to a dialogue with India to seek an early 
solution to the Kashmir problem on the basis of "norms of justice" 
and "wishes of the people of Kashmir" and to simultaneously discuss 
"all other issues" between the two countries, he said.

Mr Riaz affirmed that Pakistan stood committed to Simla Agreement 
and the Lahore Declaration as well as the United Nations' Kashmir 
resolutions while India attempted to portray the July 15 Agra 
summit as a "non-event".

<a name="will">Pakistan willing to continue talks on Kashmir issue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 14: President Pervez Musharraf said he was willing 
to "go to any length" to keep good ties with India and settle 
disputes between the two neighbours.

In the flag-hoisting speech marking 54th Independence Day, he said 
he wanted further talks with India after his summit talks with 
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee last month collapsed 
because of differences over Kashmir. "We are in favour of further 
talks on the Kashmir dispute and other issues of difference with 
India without sacrificing our sovereignty and our national honour 
and our national dignity," Musharraf said.

"We are willing to go to any length in order to maintain friendly 
relations with all our neighbours, which is particularly true with 
regard to India because we are convinced that without the amicable 
solution of the Kashmir dispute the two countries cannot progress."

<a name="ceas">CE asks Indian leaders to exercise restraint</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: President Pervez Musharraf has called upon the 
Indian leadership to "exercise restraint" in their statements to 
improve relations between the two countries. "I am exercising 
restraint myself and trying to avoid giving provocative statements 
with the sole purpose of settling disputes with India through 
peaceful means," he said.

He said that Pakistan wanted peaceful resolution of all disputes 
with India including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir. "I have 
adopted a positive attitude and now the Indian leadership should 
respond in the same fashion so that our differences on various 
issues could be narrowed down," the president urged.

"I think there should be some decorum and it cannot be achieved 
unless both the sides exercise restraint," Gen Musharraf said. 
"There should not be a violation of rules to improve our 
relations." He regretted that all kinds of negative statements were 
being made in India after the Agra summit. "But I want to say with 
all sincerity that Pakistan wants good relations with India. 
Pakistan wants to continue holding talks with India to settle the 
Kashmir issue," he said.

Nevertheless, he reiterated that without the resolution of Kashmir 
issue, relations between the two countries were not likely to 
improve.

'<a name="spec">Special Powers Act to intensify repression in Valley'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 11: The Foreign Office spokesman said that the 
Indian government's decision to extend to the Jammu region its so-
called Armed Forces Special Powers Act 1990 is a further evidence 
of its policy of brutal repression against the popular freedom 
struggle in occupied territory.

"The government of Pakistan condemns this decision which will 
further intensify repression and human rights violations by the 
Indian occupation forces in Jammu and Kashmir," the spokesman said. 
He said, this black law, which has been applied to the Kashmir 
valley for over a decade, gives license to the Indian armed forces 
to shoot and kill people at will.

According to the All Parties Hurriyet Conference, 700,000 Indian 
military, paramilitary and police forces have massacred more than 
75,000 innocent Kashmiris since 1989, the spokesman said. He said, 
the Indian reign of terror has brutalized the people of the 
occupied state.-APP

He added that he would not only visit India, but would also visit 
Russia and other countries to voice the injustices being 
perpetuated on the people of smaller provinces.

He urged the Sindhi intellectuals and writers to shun their old 
prejudices and differences created by the "Punjabi Establishment" 
and join the struggle for the rights of Sindh.

He said he was ready to work under the leadership of any party if 
it did not toe the line of the Establishment, adding that he 
sincerely believed in the unity of Sindh and the rights of Sindhi

<a name="usse">US senators accuse China of selling arms </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Aug 16: Despite Chinese denials of reports that it has 
been selling arms and missile-related equipment to Pakistan, Iran 
and North Korea, accusations against Beijing continue, and three US 
senators repeated the charges.

The senators, Joseph Biden, who heads the Senate foreign relations 
committee, and Fred Thomson were among four who paid a visit to 
China earlier this month, and the two appeared in a television 
program to call for sanctions against Chinese companies alleged to 
be involved in weapons' transfers.

Another member of the senatorial delegation that visited China, 
Arlen Specter, alleged Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Prime 
Minister Zhu Rongji had "stonewalled" during discussions of the 
issue. 

On Monday, the State Department had announced it would be sending 
an inter-agency delegation to Beijing for talks on arms sales and 
the perceived failure of China to abide by a commitment made last 
year that such sales would not be undertaken. China has 
consistently maintained that it has not sold any weapon parts or 
components to Pakistan or anyone else since the undertaking was 
given last November.

The right-wing Washington Times quoted unnamed US intelligence 
officials in a report last week as saying that China had continued 
to supply missile-related technology and components for Pakistan's 
Shaheen-1 and Shaheen-2 strategic missile programs and that a US 
spy satellite had detected a shipment from the China Machinery and 
Equipment Corporation as late as May 1 as it crossed the border 
into Pakistan. A senior Bush administration official had told the 
paper that China's missile exports to Pakistan were particularly 
serious and could lead to US sanctions.

Reporting on the senators' comments on Thursday, the paper said 
Senator Specter had told Chinese officials "rather bluntly" that 
the evidence from intelligence sources was "powerful." But they had 
been rebuffed by the Chinese, who have retorted by referring to the 
US support for Taiwan's military build-up which Beijing says is 
directed against it.

The repeat accusations on the Chinese sales issue coincide with the 
arrival in Washington of Foreign Secretary Inamul Haque for two 
days of discussions with US officials on a whole range of bilateral 
and regional issues.

<a name="inam">Inam off to US to discuss curbs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: Foreign Secretary Inamul Haque left for 
Washington to have consultations with his US counterpart on the 
latest developments in respect of bilateral relations, particularly 
in the context of presidential announcement of the "political 
roadmap" for democracy and the regional situation.

The foreign secretary's meetings are scheduled on Friday and 
Saturday. One of the topics at the State Department talks may 
relate to the reported intention of the US to move next month for 
lifting sanctions on India and Pakistan imposed after the 1998 
nuclear explosions.

The US administration is reported to be close to withdraw sanctions 
against India and to resume military and economic cooperation 
sometime next month.

A similar American action regarding the sanctions against Pakistan 
is stated to be in considerable doubt. Pakistan suffers from 
sanctions both on account of having carried out nuclear tests as 
well as because of the overthrow of the constitutional democratic 
order by the military on Oct 12, 1999.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Aug 13: The United States is still in the process of 
reviewing sanctions against India and Pakistan and no decisions 
have yet been made. This was clarified by deputy spokesman Philip 
Reeker at the State Department's daily when he was asked to comment 
on reports that a process of lifting sanctions against India might 
begin as soon as Congress returns from its summer break next month.

Mr Reeker said headlines notwithstanding, a review of the sanctions 
policy was going on and Congress was being consulted. No 
conclusions had been reached so far. He again outlined the well-
known position with regard to Pakistan, pointing out that apart 
from the sanctions imposed following nuclear tests in 1998, which 
also apply to India, Islamabad was also faced various other curbs 
such as those under the Glenn, Pressler and Symington amendments 
and those that went into force under United States law when 
Pakistan slipped into military rule. The deputy spokesman also 
again underlined the importance the US attached to its relationship 
with India.

<a name="crit">Pakistan criticized for closing border with Afghanistan </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Qamar Ahmed

LONDON, Aug 11: Pakistan's military regime has been accused of 
breach of international law for closing the border with 
neighbouring Afghanistan and at the same time pushing the refugees 
back into Afghanistan.

A lead article in Saturday's 'The Guardian' also says that Pakistan 
has refused to allow the UN to provide aid to the arrivals from 
across the border. According to the writer of the article the 
United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees had signed a deal last 
week with Pakistan government under which the UNHCR is allowed to 
vet the arrivals and provide aid to those who are regarded as 
legitimate refugees but there is a big worry by some that Pakistani 
officials will not accept the UN's criteria for what makes a 
legitimate refugee, says the paper.

<a name="dipl">Diplomats get Afghan visit visa: Leave for Kabul </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Syed Talat Hussain

ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: Three officials of the US, German and Australian 
missions in Islamabad will fly to Afghanistan on a UN plane on 
Tuesday to meet the Taliban officials with the request that they be 
allowed to see their nationals detained on the charge of preaching 
Christianity, diplomatic sources confirmed on Monday.

The visit became possible after the Taliban gave the officials of 
these embassies the visas to travel to Afghanistan just before noon 
on Sunday. However, the Taliban's visa is restricted in nature and 
does not allow the possibility of a meeting between these officials 
and the detained foreign nationals of Shelter Now International, 
the non-governmental organization accused of proselytizing Afghans 
to Christianity.

Immediately after the Taliban granted the visas, meetings were held 
at the US Embassy on whether or not to accept the restricted visas. 
According to diplomatic sources, while the granting of the visas 
had resolved a major issue, the denial of access to the detained 
workers fell short of the demand of these embassies to meet their 
nationals. Eventually, however, a decision was taken to send a 
three-member group, one American, one German and one Australian 
diplomat, to meet the Taliban inside Afghanistan.

The diplomats say that they have not given up their basic demand 
that they should be allowed to provide legal and consular services 
to their nationals.

However, the Taliban's position is that the officials of these 
embassies are being allowed in Afghanistan only for taking up the 
whole matter, and for showing them the evidence they have gathered 
against the detained workers. These nationals, the Taliban say, 
will be tried once investigations are completed against them and 
till then they cannot be allowed to meet anyone.

"For us it (the visit) is simply an opportunity to press the 
Taliban to fulfil their international obligation of giving us 
access to our nationals. There is little else to discuss as far as 
we are concerned," said one diplomat.

<a name="swee">Sweeping powers given to police: President amends law</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: President Gen Pervez Musharraf amended Police 
Act of 1861, giving sweeping powers to the police system being 
introduced with the establishment of district governments in the 
country.

An order called 'Police (Amendment) Order 2001,' was issued late on 
Sunday night by President Gen Pervez Musharraf in his capacity as 
the chief executive and in exercise of the authority assumed by him 
under Provisional Constitutional Order of 1861.

An official involved in the formulation of police reforms said the 
order had covered only few areas related to introduction of Zila 
Nazims and District Public Safety Commissions and a detailed 
ordinance would be issued within a month.

The official seeking anonymity, said these amendments were approved 
at a recent meeting presided over by the President. When asked 
whether the objections raised by the provincial governments had 
been addressed, he replied in the affirmative.

The blanket power vested in the police force included acquiring of 
any unclaimed property. "It shall be the duty of every police 
office to take charge of all unclaimed property and to furnish an 
inventory to the district superintendent of police who shall send a 
copy of the inventory to the district public safety commission."

<a name="expe">Experts find flaws in new police law</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Arshad Sharif

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: The Police (Amendment) Order 2001 does not 
resonate with the devolution and decentralization policy of the 
government as it concentrates executive, magisterial and municipal 
powers in the hands of police officers, legal experts said.

Talking to Dawn, Advocate Niaz A Shah Kakakhel said that in the 
case of Police Amendment Order 2001 the federation is encroaching 
upon the constitutionally granted power of the provinces by dealing 
with the law and order subject and encroaching upon provincial 
autonomy.

"The Police Act 1861 is a provincial statute as once a provincial 
government adopts the Act by an order in the official gazette, only 
it has the power to withdraw it."

Sources said that all the four provincial governments had objected 
to the promulgation of the Police Ordinance as proposed by the 
National Reconstruction Bureau.

On refusal to promulgate the provincial Ordinances before Aug 14, 
the Centre was forced to issue an Order to give legal cover to the 
role of the police in the newly elected local government.

Legal experts said that Section 15 of the Police Order 2001, which 
confers magisterial powers on the police officials, violates the 
principle of separation of executive and judiciary as enshrined in 
the Constitution.

Sources said that the Police (Amendment) Order 2001 creates an 
imbalance between responsibility and authority of provincial 
government by making the district police officer responsible to the 
Zila Nazim under section 5. "The new police order will preclude the 
provincial government from carrying out its primary duty of 
maintenance of law and order by reducing its role to resolution of 
disputes between the Zila Nazim and the provincial government under 
clause 3 of section 5 of the Police Order 2001, sources added.

Experts feared that the commissions would not be able to exercise 
civilian control over police because they are only advisory bodies 
having no meaningful powers to initiate inquiry or power to 
transfer a police officer of any rank. The commissions, as formed 
under the Order 2001, do not have daily monitoring system nor 
judicial, executive or financial control over the police 
department, they added.

<a name="poli">Politicians reject govt move to redefine powers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Aug 12: While the government is set to redefine the powers 
of the centre and the provinces to take the devolution plan to its 
logical conclusion, various political leaders have strongly opposed 
the move as detrimental to the unity of the country.

Some of the leaders, while talking to Dawn on Sunday, apprehended 
that under the new scheme the provinces would be robbed of what 
they already had. However, some others also questioned the 
competence of the government to disturb the arrangement delineated 
in the constitution.

ARD President Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan said the military regime had 
no authority to make any change in the existing framework of the 
distribution of powers between the federation and the provinces. To 
change the current arrangement, he said, the constitution would 
have to be amended and such an act was beyond the competence of the 
present rulers.

The senior leader said that a decision on decentralisation or re-
distribution of powers between the centre and the provinces could 
be taken only by an elected parliament through a procedure laid 
down in the 1973 constitution.

He said if the decision on the quantum of autonomy was taken by the 
military regime, which they are planning to do, the constitution 
and parliament would become redundant.

The Nawabzada said while there was a need for maximum provincial 
autonomy, the centre should also not be left at the mercy of the 
provinces as in such a situation the working of the federal 
government would come to a halt in case the provinces refused to 
contribute funds to the centre.

<a name="terr">Terrorism to be curbed, says law minister</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: By banning the two sectarian organizations and 
placing their guardians under observation, the government has sent 
a clear message that it is serious in combating terrorism and would 
go to any length to rid the nation of this curse.

This was stated by the officials of the Law and Interior division, 
at a press conference. They said the government would not allow 
terrorism activities to go unchecked and would continue making 
efforts for reviving a tolerant society in which people belonging 
to all religious sects could live in a peaceful manner.

The joint press conference was addressed by Law Minister Shahida 
Jamil and Interior Secretary Tasneem Noorani, and officials of both 
the ministries. Giving justification for amending the anti-
terrorism law, the law minister said terms like "fundamentalism" 
and "terrorism" had earned a bad name for the country and affected 
flow of investment in the country.

The present government, she said, was committed to change this 
image and a campaign is being launched to maintain law and order in 
the country. The law minister said the amended law provided that 
the banned organizations could file review application against the 
government decision. If not satisfied with the findings of the 
Proscribed Organization Review Committee, high courts and Supreme 
Court could be approached, she added.

She said investors were not willing to invest in Pakistan due to 
the law and order situation. To a question, the officials explained 
that the decision to keep the two organizations, Tehrik-i-Jafferia 
Pakistan and Sipha-i-Sahaba, under observation, was valid for six 
months.

Interior secretary when asked whether any formal instructions had 
been issued for keeping the two parties under observation, said so 
far no order had been issued, but added that order would be issued 
soon. When told that the verbal orders of the chief executive 
regarding banning the two outfits had no standing in the eyes of 
the law, the officials did not offer any reply.

The officials said any publicity of the banned organizations was 
prohibited and the newspaper should desist from publishing 
statements of the members of the banned organizations. The 
officials said restriction of publication was, in fact, in favour 
of the press. Earlier, the press had no justification to publish 
their statements. The law minister explained that "factual news 
report, made in good faith, shall not be construed to mean 
projection." The interior secretary said if the government had 
objection to any report, a challan would be submitted in the court 
and it would be up to the court to decide the case.

Bureau Report

HYDERABAD, Aug 15: A spokesman for the Tehrik-i-Jafria Pakistan 
(TJP) has taken strong exception to President Pervez Musharraf's 
speech that the president delivered on the Independence Day, 
warning the party that he would not hesitate to ban it.

In a statement, issued, the spokesman said the warning was an 
insult to the Shias, and added that the warning had been issued on 
the advice of "inefficient" advisors (to the president).

The Lashkar-i-Jhangvi was simply non-existent and "this fact is 
known to the agencies and the entire nation", he said, adding that 
the fact was that the Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan itself was involved 
in the bloodshed.

The TJP spokesman claimed that press reports were witness to the 
fact that all the terrorists that had been arrested belonged to the 
Sipah-i-Sahaba-i-Pakistan.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Asif Shahzad

LAHORE, Aug 15: The Punjab police launched a crackdown on outlawed 
Lashkar-i-Jhangvi (LJ) and Sipah-i-Muhammad Pakistan (SMP) and 
arrested their 50 leaders and activists.

It also raided Sipah-i-Sahaba (SSP) and Tehrik-i-Jafaria (TJP) 
offices in its search for 'terrorists'. The arrests were made in 
pre-dawn raids throughout the province. However, AFP quoting 
officials from Islamabad reported that the police arrested more 
than 200 people in a crackdown against two organizations throughout 
the country. It said heavy police contingents raided residences of 
the suspects, mainly in the central Punjab, scene of recurring 
violence and sectarian killings.

The TJP head office in Lahore was sealed whereas sub-offices were 
raided by heavy police contingents accompanied by members of Elite 
Force and commandos, our reporter continues. Sources said the head 
office was sealed following information of an intelligence agency 
that the premises was being used by its splinter group, the SMP. 
However, the authorities concerned later allowed re-opening of the 
head office when the TJP leadership lodged strong protest.

The SSP head office in Shahdara, Lahore, was also raided. 
Residences of the SSP and TJP leadership and their workers were 
also raided. During the operation, police seized 'objectionable' 
literature from the offices and residences of the leaders and 
workers. Of the arrests, 24 were made in Lahore. 

A Punjab police official told Dawn that fate of those arrested 
would be decided at a meeting. "Those who are not wanted in any 
case will be released."

Tehrik-i-Jafaria - would be watched, he said.

Convention Centre here. Nobody would be allowed to incite sectarian 
and ethnic hatred and, for that, a law, in an amended form, was 
being introduced today, President Musharraf said.

The law prescribed stringent punishment for terrorism, he said, 
adding that the chief justice had already issued instructions for 
the disposal of terrorism cases on priority basis, he said. Law 
enforcement agencies, including the police and rangers, had been 
instructed to carry out operations against sectarian and ethnic 
organizations, he added.

<a name="anti">Anti-Terrorism Act amended</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14: President Gen Pervez Musharraf introduced 
amendments to anti-terrorism law, empowering the government to ban 
any organization involved in terrorism.

Under the amended law printing, publishing, or disseminating any 
material, for projecting any person convicted for a terrorist act 
or any banned organization or an organization placed under 
observation would be an offence punishable with imprisonment up to 
six months.

The amended law, however, provided an exception. "A factual news 
report made in good faith shall not be construed to mean projection 
(of person or organization)." The amended anti-terrorism law, 
called Anti-Terrorism (amendment) Ordinance, 2001, says that 
organizations proscribed for its activities like Lashkar-i-Jhangvi 
and Sipha-i-Muhammad, could apply, within 30 days of the government 
order, for the review of the decision.

The organizations placed under observation, like Tehrik Nifaz 
Fiqah-i-Jaferia and Sipha-i-Sahaba Pakistan, could also file review 
application against the government order. Offices of the proscribed 
organizations can be sealed, and accounts frozen. The organization 
under observation will have to submit accounts of income and 
expenditure.

The parties proscribed could, however, apply to the federal 
government for lifting of ban after three years from the date of 
proscription and the government, if satisfied with the explanation 
of the party, may lift the ban.

The law enforcement agencies can lay a cordon for terrorist 
investigation of any area by demarcation of the cordoned area for 
14 days, extendible from time to time but not beyond 20 days from 
the date of laying cordon. All those offences triable under the ATA 
law, with punishment up to 3 years, would be non-bailable. No 
court, except the ATA court, High Court or Supreme Court, will be 
empowered to grant bail to the accused under ATA (amendment) 
Ordinance, 2001.

Under the amended law, giving directions for terrorist activities 
while living abroad, is an offence, punishable with seven years 
imprisonment. To protect the judges, witnesses, and other persons 
related to a case, the amended law provides for closed door 
proceedings.

Those convicted under terrorism charges will not be entitled to 
remission of sentence except the juvenile convicts. The government 
under the law would have powers to take action by sealing the 
office of the said organization and freezing its accounts. All 
literature, posters, banners or other gadgets which could be used 
for fanning sectarianism could also be seized. Under the law all 
the religious parties, under watch, would be required to disclose 
their funding sources by submitting all accounts of their income 
and expenditure.

A police officer could arrest a member of the banned organization 
without any warrant, if he had reasonable grounds to believe that 
the person was guilty of an offence under the anti-terrorism law, 
but would have to produce before the magistrate within 24 of the 
arrest.

Statements prohibited: The Punjab government has said legal action 
will be taken against publication which carries statements from 
anyone or made on the behalf of the two banned sectarian 
organizations - the Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and the Sipah-i-Muhammad.

An official handout issued here on Tuesday said the government, 
through the amended Terrorist Act, 2001, has banned publication, 
printing or dissemination of any press statement, press conferences 
or public utterances by or on behalf of the two banned 
organizations.

<a name="pppo">PPP opposes role for army in uplift projects</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 13: The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) expressed 
concern on reports suggesting a role for the military in local 
development projects. A spokesman for the party said such role 
would further deepen the divide between the Army and the people. He 
said "the policies of the government have already pitted the army 
against the people as never before.

The new scheme, of empowering army men to run the local governments 
or clearing the development projects, will only deepen the divide 
further". The spokesman said the proposal if implemented, would 
divest the local and provincial governments of all authority and 
concentrating powers in the GHQ.

This is nothing but imposition of the notorious One Unit on the 
hapless provinces and make a mockery of devolution and the rights 
of the people. He said the government had already sacked hundreds 
of low paid civil employees from government and autonomous 
departments replacing them with serving and retired army men at 
hefty salaries.

He said the government had kept the army men beyond the net of 
accountability and refused to take notice of 'corruption within its 
ranks'. The spokesman alleged the state bureaucracy had been 
terrorised and demoralized through the so called army monitoring 
teams. 

Defence personnel alone, as a class, had been exempted from toll 
tax on highways giving the message that the military was a class 
apart from the common citizen, he added. He said "but pandering to 
its constituency in such a thoughtless and insensitive manner as to 
bring the paving of streets and lining of drains under the military 
teams, the government is doing incalculable damage to the 
federation and also to the institution of the army itself." He said 
his party urged the government to desist from adopting policies 
which were bound to strike at the root of federation and erode its 
integrity.-PPI

<a name="150m">$150m ADB loan likely for judicial reforms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 15: The Asian Development Bank is likely to extend 
$150 million by December this year to help Pakistan undertake 
judicial reforms. A six-member team of the bank is arriving here on 
Aug 20 to discuss and finalize the" Access to Justice Program (AJP) 
Loan". It will also review proposed police reforms and dovolution 
process.

The overall objective of the loan is to help improve access to 
justice so as to: (i) provide security and justice to people, 
particularly the poor; (ii) strengthen legitimacy of state 
institutions; and (iii) create conditions for the revival of growth 
by fostering confidence of investors.

The following five major outcomes are expected:

1. Enactment of laws and regulations, consistent with the 
Constitution, to carry out reform policies for the judiciary, 
police and decentralised administration. These include laws for 
freedom of information, consumer protection, and accountability of 
public servants and government officials.

2. Greater efficiency and effectiveness in Judicial, Police and 
Administrative Services. Measures include improved records and 
information management, linking courts, prisons, and the police, 
facilitating fair and expeditious justice, and implementation of 
Small Causes Courts, and amendments to the Family Court Act.

3. Greater equity and accessibility to Judicial, Police and 
Administrative Services for the vulnerable poor. Some steps in this 
regard could be publication of laws in Urdu, functioning of 
conciliation courts at district level, and the establishment of a 
legal empowerment fund to encourage representation of justice 
interests of the vulnerable poor.

4. Improved predictability and consistency between fiscal and human 
resource allocation and requirements of reformed judicial, police 
and administration institutions. This would involve the approval of 
a judicial sector medium-term budget and expenditure framework to 
provide a more predictable and increasing fiscal and human 
resourcing for the sector.

5. Greater transparency and accountability in performance of the 
judiciary, police and administration. 

Steps include the publication of annual performance reports by high 
courts, and establishment and proper resourcing of Public Safety 
Commissions at national, provincial, and district levels.

<a name="adbo">ADB okays $100m drought aid</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
MANILA, Aug 16: Pakistan is to receive 100 million dollars in 
emergency aid from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as drought aid, 
the Manila-based lender said. The three-year project will build 
small reservoirs and retention dams, improve community-managed 
irrigation and water supply systems, rehabilitate village roads and 
support critical public services for agriculture and health care, 
an ADB statement said.

The bank said the three-year dry spell has wrought havoc for 
millions of rural people in Balochistan and Sindh provinces, with 
the Islamabad government projecting a balance of payments deficit 
of 927 million dollars this year as a consequence.

"As we don't know how long the drought will last, the urgent need 
is to provide income opportunities for the most affected 
communities," said ADB agriculture and rural development division 
manager Fred Roche. "At the same time, there is a need to set the 
stage for post-drought recovery in the affected regions."

The bank did not say if the aid would be in the form of loans or 
grants, but said the funds would come from loan savings on ongoing 
projects in Pakistan. -AFP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Wajahat Ijaz

GUJRAT, Aug 11: Seven people died when a powerful bomb planted in a 
motorcycle rickshaw exploded. The victims included a couple and 
their three sons. It was so powerful that it threw a body on to the 
roof of a nearby house. Another body was recovered from the 
premises of the municipal committee which is about 20 feet from the 
spot. The district administration and the police arrived at the 
spot 30 minutes after the blast. The victims were taken to the DHQ 
hospital by the Edhi ambulances.

One of the injured, Imtiaz, was taken to a hospital in Lahore due 
to his critical condition and driver Faizullah was shifted to the 
combined military hospital in Kharian. Police quoted the driver as 
saying a man who boarded the three-wheeler at the Ram Talai Chowk 
and got off near the Children's Park moments before the blast, 
might be the culprit.

The officials of bomb disposal squad told Dawn that they could not 
find the bomb detonator. "It is very difficult for us to tell the 
weight, power and type of the bomb in the absence of the 
detonator," they added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reportesr

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: The Pakistan Muslim League (N) has said the 
killing of seven people including three children and injuries to 
dozens of others in Gujrat bomb blast on Saturday testifies to the 
failure of the military regime in ensuring protection to the life, 
honor and property of the people.

In a statement issued here Sunday, the PML (N) leader said that 
since October 12, 1999 military takeover, the rulers had "set a 
record of failures" in all fields of life, with law and order 
topping this list. Citing examples of the military rulers failure 
in maintaining the law and order, Saranjam Khan said that on July 
26, Managing Director of PSO Shaukat Mirza and his driver were 
assassinated in Karachi. Two days later, PML leader Muhammad 
Siddique Khan Kanju and Aslam Joya were killed in Lodhran in a 
bustling bazaar.

He said on July 30, the Director, Ministry of Defence, Zafar 
Hussain Zaidi was murdered in Karachi, followed by the killing of a 
religious leader Syed Rizwan Shah in Lahore, the same day.

The PML Secretary General said the increasing incidents of 
terrorism, dacoities and abductions for ransom had tarnished the 
image of the country in the eyes of the international community, 
strengthening their impression about Pakistan as "a country without 
law."

He said the de-weaponization campaign of the government was aimed 
more at jacking up its image than at eliminating illegal weapon 
culture. He said the drive had in fact disarmed the peaceful and 
law-abiding citizens, throwing them at the mercy of the terrorists 
and the anti-social elements.

<a name="fore">Foreign investment drops to $182m in 00-01</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Aug 14: Foreign investment in Pakistan dropped down to all 
time low of $182 million during last fiscal from $543.4 million a 
year earlier in 1999-2000 mainly because of the heavy withdrawal of 
portfolio investment.

Stock brokers report of withdrawal of $140.4 million or more than 
Rs8 billion at an average rate of Rs60 a dollar during 2000-01 
plunging the stocks to go down below 1,300 points.

Left with no choice, the government at the highest level, is 
seeking intervention of the nationalized banks to stop this rot and 
contain this plunge before it hits the psychological mark of 1,200 
points. The government now expects the nationalized commercial 
banks to invest from their funds. 

How far the banks respond to government's request for putting at 
stake depositors' funds in PTCL and PSO equities which are at 
historically low at present is yet to be seen.

During last fiscal, $12 million portfolio investment flowed in from 
Singapore but more than $152 million were withdrawn. A year earlier 
in 1999-2000 $73.5 million were invested in the stocks.

Highest amount of $37.8 million was withdrawn by the USA investors 
followed by $36.9 million by Swiss investors, $33.8 million by the 
investors in UK, $16.3 million by the Hong Kong, $10.9 million by 
the UAE, $1.7 million by Saudi Arabia, and $1.3 million by Dutch 
investors.

Flow of direct foreign investment also came down by about 30 per 
cent to $322.4 million in 2000-01 from $469.9 million in 1999-2000. 
Highest amount of $92.7 million flowed in from the USA followed by 
$90.5 million from UK, $56.6 million from Saudi Arabia, $15.5 
million from Germany, $4.8 million from the Netherlands, $3.7 
million from Korea, $3.7 million from Singapore and $3.6 million 
from Switzerland.

Oil and gas are becoming focus of foreign investors' attention 
where the highest amount of $84.7 million investment flowed in. 
Transport, storage and communications received $81.5 million 
investment followed by food, beverage and tobacco sector received 
investment of $45.1 million mainly because, the Pakistan Tobacco 
offered right shares of $39.2 million in November and December last 
year.

Direct foreign investment in power amounts to $40.3 million 
followed by $26.3 million in chemicals, pharmaceuticals and 
fertilizers, $15.2 million in cement, $12.5 million in 
construction, $13.2 million in trade, $8.7 million in petro-
chemicals and petroleum refining.

Financial sector reported withdrawal of $34.9 million investment in 
the last fiscal. It pertains to $36 million disinvestment on 
acquisition of three branches of Bank of America by the Union Bank. 
Another $9.2 million disinvestment transaction pertains to Gulf 
Commercial Bank taken over by the PICIC.

<a name="pcch">PC chief unveils schedule: Accelerated privatization plan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 16: Chairman of the Privatization Commission Saleem 
Altaf announced a detailed schedule of what can be termed as an 
"accelerated privatization program" of a large number of public 
sector enterprises commencing from this month.

He conceded that there has been some delay in the privatization but 
as he explained it was because of the time consumed in framing and 
placement of regulatory frameworks, taking up of sectoral reforms, 
appointment of top class financial advisers and to ensure that the 
"process remains transparent, it attracts maximum number of 
investors in Pakistan and there is an even-playing field for all 
the investors".

The PC chairman gave an update on privatization while speaking at a 
seminar organized by Mediators, a private public affairs consultant 
company, on "Pakistan's Privatization - Policy and Programme" on 
Thursday. Sindh finance minister Dr Abdul Hafiz Sheikh spoke on the 
central issues and concerns with reference to the privatization 
while Dr Mateen Thobani made a detailed presentation on the steps 
involved in privatization of public assets.

Depending on the conditions of the stock exchanges, Saleem Altaf 
indicated two capital market transactions - 16.6 per cent Muslim 
Commercial Bank shares and 5 to 10 per cent National Bank of 
Pakistan shares - would be offered to investors either this month 
or in September. He was hopeful of offering 35 per cent shares of 
Pakistan Oilfields either this month or in September and 35 per 
cent shares of Attock Refinery in December through bourses.

He expects bidding of PTCL and the United Bank in November. He said 
that 11 investors have given expressions of interest (EoI) for the 
PTCL and 21 for the UBL. He indicated bidding for nine oil and gas 
fields next month for which 15 EoIs have been received from 
Pakistan, USA, Canada, China, Oman, Malaysia, Netherlands and 
Austria.

October may also see the bidding for strategic sale of 58 per cent 
shares of National Investment Trust for which 11 EoIs have been 
received. In October he expects the appointment of financial 
adviser for the Habib Bank which may be taken to market in March or 
April next year. The PC chairman announced the completion of the 
pre-qualification process for Pak-Saudi Fertilisers for which 
bidding may take place in next five or six weeks after the 
announcement of fertilizer policy.

Privatization transaction for the PSO is expected to be taken to 
market in December this year while EoI's for either 51 per cent or 
26 per cent shares of the OGDCL are likely to be invited in 
November or December. He announced that the financial adviser was 
conducting the due diligence and preparing financial and technical 
models for the transaction of the KESC which may be taken to market 
next April or May.

Responding to a question, the PC chairman clarified that the 
financial adviser for the KESC was being paid 2 million dollars and 
not 5 million dollars as was being said in certain quarters. Of 
this fee, he said, the ADB has offered one million dollar grant 
while the government is paying one million dollar. A top ranking 
financial adviser has already been identified for facilitating 
privatization of the Pakistan Petroleum which may take seven 
months. Similarly EoIs have been sought for appointment of 
financial advisers of the Sui Southern and Sui Northern.

Saleem Altaf also spelt out the schedule of privatization of six 
other enterprises of which he expects transactions next month of 
Lasbella Textile, Flatties Hotel, PECO and National Power 
Construction while those of Malam Jabba Ski Resort and Javedan 
Cement in November.

Sindh Finance Minister Dr Hafiz Sheikh, who was associated in the 
privatization process in Argentina, Indonesia, Malaysia and a few 
other countries as a functionary of the World Bank, shared his 
experiences and suggested a strategy to counter the moves of what 
he called "hidden opponents" of the privatization programme. He 
stressed for maintaining a communication with the people to assure 
them that disinvestment of public enterprises and change of the 
government control management to private sector serves their 
interest best.

Public sector enterprises in Pakistan, he said, suffer a loss of 
Rs90 billion a year which is passed on to the people who have to 
pay taxes. Dr Mateen Thobani spoke of the time taken in creating an 
enabling environment and gave a history of the PTCL privatization 
launched in 1992.

Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 16: Urging exporters to bring their foreign exchange 
earnings back to the country and honestly declare them to the 
central bank, President Gen Pervez Musharraf has reassured them 
that the foreign currency accounts (FCAs) will never be frozen in 
future.

The President was speaking at the inauguration of a software 
technology park at the Aiwan-i-Iqbal. He said the government would 
provide all facilities to the software exporters and support their 
endeavors to increase their exports.

He said the government had already announced several incentives for 
the software exporters so that they could push up their exports to 
$1 billion in the shortest possible time. He said Pakistan had 
quality human resources and infrastructure whose full potential 
needed to be exploited and exports increased. He said the promotion 
of information technology (IT) and the economic recovery of the 
country were two top priorities of his government. He said major 
initiatives had been taken to expand computer literacy, develop 
human resources and make the facility of Internet available to all 
people throughout the country.

He was of the view that IT could be exploited to alleviate poverty 
in the rural areas where 60 to 70 per cent of the country's 
population resided and to create jobs for the educated unemployed 
in the urban areas. He said his administration had already embarked 
upon an e- government program to make the public sector more 
efficient and transparent. He said software parks were being set up 
to promote software exports. One such park, he said, had already 
been established in Islamabad. He said the private sector would 
also be supported in its efforts to set up such parks.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 16: Saudi Arabia and China have asked Pakistan to

dollars new funding line in the shape of Poverty Reduction Growth 
Facility (PRGF).

Official sources said that both China and Saudi Arabia, who are

government to satisfy the IMF officials about the state of the 
economy so that the existing 596-million-dollar Standby Arrangement 
(SBA) could be replaced with PRGF before the end of this year.

The sources said Pakistan would have to maneuver hard to resolve 
some of the political issues with the G-8 countries. "Although the 
US and the West have cautiously welcomed President Pervez 
Musharraf's announcement to hold general election in October 2002, 
they are still to be satisfied on the return of democracy," they 
added.

<a name="sbps">SBP scraps PIB auction to avoid monopoly</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Aug 15: The State Bank had to scrap the auction of 10-year 
Pakistan Investment Bonds to save the market from being cornered by 
a single institution.

SBP said it rejected Rs28 billion bids received for the PIBs but 
did not give any reason for its action. Senior bankers said the 
central bank had to scrap the bids to stop monopolization of the 
market by a primary dealer that had come up with a very large bid. 
Bankers said the primary dealer had submitted the bid on behalf of 
a large semi-privatized bank adding that the bid amount was a 
little higher than the auction target of Rs10 billion. "Accepting 
the bid was like granting a licence to the bank in question to 
corner the market. That was why SBP had to scrap the auction," said 
a senior banker close to SBP.

SBP said it would announce the next auction in due course of time 
without being specific. The State Bank normally gives 14- day 
notice to its primary dealers for holding the auction of the bonds. 
SBP said though it rejected all bids for the bonds received in the 
auction it accepted the bids against short-selling by primary 
dealers but did not give figures. Senior bankers said the amount 
thus raised by the central bank was not more than Rs2 billion.

<a name="work">Working of WAPDA, KESC unsatisfactory: WB</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Khaleeq Kiani

ISLAMABAD, Aug 12: World Bank has rated as "highly unsatisfactory" 
the performance of WAPDA and the KESC in the $3 billion power 
sector reform program. "The entire energy sector was jeopardized by 
the poor financial performance of WAPDA and KESC, which resulted 
from the failure (i) to achieve efficiency improvements through 
restructuring and privatization (ii) to receive regular tariff 
adjustments and (iii) of government, particularly at the provincial 
level, to pay for electricity," says a confidential assessment 
report of the bank.

"Overall, WAPDA's implementation performance is rated as highly 
unsatisfactory," it said. Major deficiencies highlighted by the 
bank suggested that institutional objectives were not fully 
achieved. WAPDA's financial performance has been poor, WAPDA Power 
Purchase Organization (WPPO) never developed the full capacity to 
implement and monitor the power purchase agreements. WPPO suffered 
from turnover in its senior management. IPPs faced delays due to 
failure to provide interconnection on time, WPPO did not cooperate 
with IPPs in plant testing and commissioning, and WAPDA resorted to 
negotiating tariff with many IPPs before their commissioning.

The bank said that 20 Independent Power Producers (IPPs) could face 
further pressure to reduce their tariffs, and the commercial 
lenders to restructure the IPP debt. Of late, WAPDA started making 
substantive progress in implementing the reform program and brought 
some relief to the cash-flow problems, but the IPP crisis 
contributed to the lack of confidence among investors. "This leads 
to the conclusion that unless the power sector reform is fully 
implemented, the framework is unsustainable," the report said.

The bank has admitted that WAPDA's financial performance began to 
deteriorate significantly during the implementation of the second 
phase of Private Sector Energy Development Program.

WAPDA was not able to reduce its costs, reduce theft of electricity 
(except when the army took responsibility for meter-reading and 
billing in 1999), recover revenues from provincial government and 
government entities and obtain GOP/Nepra approval for tariff 
increase needed to maintain its financial viability.

The report said that WAPDA was successful in securing tariff 
concessions from about a dozen IPPs, all of which had yet to be 
commissioned as these were the plants over which WAPDA had the most 
leverage.

WAPDA has, however, held the World Bank responsible for failures, 
and claimed that its performance has been excellent.

exchange remittance card (FERC) system from Sept 1 to attract more 
foreign remittance and discourage Hundi system, the managing 
director of OPF, Rashid Mehmood Ansari, told Dawn on Monday.

He said after the OPF housing schemes and pension schemes, the FERC 
would be another step forward towards providing better facilities 
to overseas Pakistanis. The new scheme would be formally launched 
by the finance minister on Sept 1, he added. He said remittances by 
overseas Pakistanis through normal banking channel were a vital 
source for supporting the balance of payment position of the 
country.

The money sent through Hundi or other means deprive the country of 
the much-needed support, thus, the government initiated a concrete 
program to facilitate those non-resident Pakistanis who remit money 
through normal banking channels, he added.

He said the total foreign remittance of overseas Pakistanis to the 
country during the last fiscal was $1.08 billion and foreign 
remittance during the fiscal 1998-99 was $937 million. "The 
government is expecting substantial increase in foreign remittance 
of overseas Pakistanis after the introduction of the FERC scheme," 
he added.

<a name="fina">Financial crunch hits police reforms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Arshad Sharif

ISLAMABAD, Aug 11: The government decided to introduce the proposed 
police reforms in phases due to financial impediments and 
objections raised by the provincial governments on the issue.

The decision came at a meeting presided over by President Gen 
Pervez Musharraf, well-placed sources told Dawn. The president 
directed that the 'District Public Safety Commissions' be 
established at the earliest. The DPSCs would be put in place during 
the first phase of the implementation of the police reforms as soon 
as the newly-elected district governments started functioning.

Giving details about the second phase, officials said that the 
president had set Oct 12 as the cut-off date for putting in place 
the reformed and reorganized police structure, including the 
establishment of separate city police forces for Karachi and 
Lahore.

Sources in the finance ministry told Dawn that Rs96 billion were 
required for implementing the police reforms which was more than 
the current year's budgetary allocation of Rs80 billion for running 
the entire civilian administrative apparatus. The finance ministry, 
sources said, was in a fix to arrange such a huge amount which was 
almost 75 per cent of the current year's defence allocation of 
Rs130 billion.

Gen Musharraf, however, assured the police chiefs that in addition 
to the Rs2 billion grant made available by the federal government, 
the provincial governments would also be told to enhance their 
budgetary allocations for the purpose during the current financial 
year. The president directed the finance ministry to also explore 
other sources of funding as the much-needed reforms could not be 
postponed for the lack of funds.

The Karachi stocks suffered fresh pruning under the lead of the 
blue chips during the preceding week as abortive bids at the 
rallies failed to put the market back on rails. Most of the leading 
shares finished with extended losses, some of them at the career-
lowest bids, including the mega issues such as the PTCL, although 
the weekend support allowed them to close partially recovered from 
the early lows.

The KSE 100-share index was off 25.74 points at 1,226.85 after 
hitting the low of 1,223.00. The market capitalization eroded 
another Rs5 billion at Rs311 billion as compared to Rs316 billion a 
week earlier.

However, strong buying in most of the leading stocks including the 
PSO, the PTCL, the Hubco, the Engro Chemical and some others has 
raised hopes.

The interim dividend news from the Engro Chemicals and the Lever 
Brothers Pakistan at 20 and 75 per cent, respectively were claimed 
to be in line with the market perceptions but not well-received in 
a falling market. The omission by Reckitt and Benckiser Pakistan 
did work against the sentiment.

The plus signs held a slight edge over the minus ones, prominent 
gainers among them being the IGI Insurance, the Kohinoor Weaving, 
Ibrahim Energy after its merger news with its sister company, 
Ibrahimm Fibre, Dawood Hercules, Cherat Paper, Clover Pakistan and 
Pakistan Services, Wyeth Pakistan, Lever Brothers, Nadeem Textiles, 
Sana Industries, Abbott Lab, Colgate Pakistan and several others.

The losers were led by the Knoll Pharma, the EFU Life Insurance, 
which was traded spot to forestall further decline in its share 
value. Fazal Textiles, Grays of Cambridge, Dawood Hercules, Adamjee 
Insurance, Lawrencepur Woollen, Gatron Industries, Clariant 
Pakistan, Al-Ghazi Tractors, New Jubilee Insurance and Paramount 
Spinning were other notable losers.

The trading volume was maintained at the previous level of 303 
million shares, bulk of which went to the credit of the PTCL, the 
Hub-Power, the PSO and the ICI Pakistan.

Other actives were led by the Engro Chemical, the Fauji Fertiliser, 
Adamjee Insurance, the FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, the MCB, Sui 
Northern, the Knoll and several others.

By Ardeshir Cowasjee

MOHAMMAD Ali Jinnah learnt his politics at Dadabhai Naoroji's feet, 
and he spent most of his life in Bombay - which the Indians have 
since renamed as Mumbai - with his peers Sir Phirozshah Mehta, Sir 
Dinshaw Watcha, Sir Dinshaw Mulla (the framer of Mohammedan Law), 
Sir Jamshedjee Kanga.

He lived in the fashion and style in which he wished to live; his 
personal life, likes, dislikes, dressing and eating habits were not 
dictated by expediency or hypocrisy. He spent not one day in jail, 
he had no truck with street demonstrators or street fighters. He 
rarely compromised his strict code of honour. He went on to carve 
out and build a homeland for his compatriots, and having done so, 
eleven months later he died.

Sarojini Naidu, the great Indian congresswoman and poet, in 1906 
wrote of Mohammad Ali Jinnah: "Never was there a nature whose outer 
qualities provided so complete an antithesis of its inner worth. 
Tall and stately, but thin to the point of emaciation, languid and 
luxurious of habit, Mohammed Ali Jinnah's attenuated form is the 
deceptive sheath of a spirit of exceptional vitality and endurance.

"Somewhat formal and fastidious, and a little aloof and imperious 
of manner, the calm hauteur of his accustomed reserve but masks for 
those who know him a naive and eager humanity, an intuition quick 
and tender as a woman's, a humour gay and winning as a child's. 
Pre-eminently rational and practical, discreet and dispassionate in 
his estimate and acceptance of life, the obvious sanity and 
serenity of his worldly wisdom effectually disguise a shy and 
splendid idealism which is of the very essence of the man."

In 1946, addressing members of the Muslim League, Jinnah told them: 
"I am an old man. God has given me enough to live comfortably at 
this age. Why would I turn my blood into water and take so much 
trouble? Not for the capitalists, surely. But for you, the poor 
people."

And on he pressed. His ambition was achieved in August 1947. Three 
days prior to the birth of his country, on the 11th of that month, 
he declared to the members of Pakistan's constituent assembly his 
credo: "The first and foremost thing that I would like to emphasize 
is this - remember that you are now a sovereign legislative body 
and you have got all the powers. It, therefore, places on you the 
gravest responsibility as to how you should take your decisions. 
The first observation that I would like to make is this: You will 
no doubt agree with me that the first duty of a government is to 
maintain law and order so that the life, property and religious 
beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the state.

"The second thing that occurs to me is this: One of the biggest 
curses from which India is suffering - I do not say that other 
countries are free from it but I think our condition is much worse 
- is bribery and corruption. That really is a poison. We must put 
that down with an iron hand and I hope that you will take adequate 
measures as soon as it is possible for this assembly to do so. 
Blackmarketing is another curse. Well, I know that blackmarketeers 
are frequently caught and punished. Judicial sentences are passed 
or sometimes fines only are imposed. Now you have to tackle this 
monster which today is a colossal crime against society, in our 
distressed conditions when we constantly face shortage of food and 
other essential commodities of life."

The third thing emphasized by Jinnah that day was nepotism and 
jobbery which, he said, "must be crushed relentlessly. I want to 
make it quite clear that I shall never tolerate any kind of 
jobbery, nepotism or any influence directly or indirectly brought 
to bear upon me."

He continued: " If you change your past and work together, and in a 
spirit that every one of you, no matter to which community he 
belongs, no matter what relations he had with you in the past, no 
matter what is his colour, cast or creed, is first, second and last 
a citizen of this state with equal rights, privileges and 
obligations, there will be no end to the progress you will make 
...... You are free; you are free to go to your temples, you are 
free to go to your mosques, or to any other places of worship in 
this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or 
creed - that has nothing to do with the business of the state."

On February 19, 1948, he recorded a broadcast to the people of 
Australia. He told them: "The great majority of us are Muslims. We 
follow the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, may peace be upon 
him, we are members of the brotherhood of Islam in which all are 
equal in rights, dignity and self-respect. Consequently we have a 
special and very deep sense of unity. But make no mistake, Pakistan 
is not a theocracy, or anything like it. Islam demands from us the 
tolerance of other creeds and we welcome in closest association 
with us all those who, of whatever creed, are themselves willing 
and ready to play their part as true and loyal citizens of 
Pakistan."

Again that month he spoke on the radio to the people of the United 
States and told them much the same thing: "Islam and its idealism 
have taught us democracy. It has taught equality of man, justice 
and fair play to everybody. We are the inheritors of these glorious 
traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and 
obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan. In 
any case, Pakistan is not going to be a theocratic state - to be 
ruled by priests with a divine mission. We have non-Muslims, 
Hindus, Christians, Parsis - but they are all Pakistanis. They will 
enjoy the same rights and privileges as any other citizen and play 
their rightful part in the affairs of Pakistan."

The truly democratic secular statesman, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, more 
by the sheer weight of his dominating will than by any other factor 
established the forward-looking and modern state of Pakistan. For 
as long as he lived and for eight years thereafter Pakistan 
remained a dominion of the British Empire. In 1956 it became a 
republic and its constitution, promulgated the same year, 
proclaimed it to be 'The Islamic Republic of Pakistan'. Ayub Khan, 
the first Ataturk of Pakistan until attacked by dry rot, in his 
constitution of 1962 again looked forward and changed the country's 
appellation to the simple unambiguous 'The Republic of Pakistan'. 
One year later, he surrendered to sycophants and supporters, 
spurred by the overriding cause of self-perpetuation. He was 
persuaded to backtrack and by an amendment the country reverted to 
being 'The Islamic Republic of Pakistan'.

In 1973, again in contradiction to Jinnah's intent and promise, 
desire and declaration, religion was made "the business of the 
state." Article 2 of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's constitution proclaimed 
that "Islam will be the religion of the state."

As it happened, ignorance was the cause of the loss of half the 
country. Now two-thirds of the remainder is barren, a desert. For 
each and every purpose Karachi has lost to the thriving and vibrant 
Dubai its geographical advantage. That little state, a brotherly 
Muslim country, with no black gold under its ground, flourishes and 
looks to the future. Why? Because it is not beset by taboos - 
religious or cultural or any other. It has adopted Islam's 
tolerance, Islam's intent to march with the times. Its citizens and 
its visitors and its foreign residents are free to live as they 
choose provided they remain within the law.

However, weeping and wailing will get us nowhere. There are still 
six inches of water under the keel. We can still refloat. 
Pakistan's second Ataturk is in command. The fact that he is a 
general of the army is no impediment. Washington, who became a 
president, was a general. Eisenhower, a general, became a 
president. And Wellington, who was a general, became a prime 
minister. MacArthur, a general, was the man who built modern Japan, 
who revived its economy and its world status. De Gaulle, builder 
and maker of today's France, was a general.

General Pervez Musharraf, a soldier, wears many hats and is in 
command. He has concluded that Kashmir cannot be won by waging war, 
or by 'jihadi' means. Realization has dawned. He seeks peace with 
India. He is dealing with a seasoned politician, Atal Behari 
Vajpayee, head of a 23-party coalition government, the leaders of 
which are as scary as are our 'leaders' whose hirsute faces are 
depicted in our press each day. To make peace, the people of both 
countries must understand each other and to do this a continued 
dialogue is required. Each must read what the other writes.

Does our general know that our antiquated import policy prevents 
the import of newspapers and magazines from India - just from 
India, from no other country ? This law can be changed by an 
ordinance, by the stroke of a pen and it can be done immediately.

Two days hence we will be flying flags and singing songs, 
celebrating the 55th anniversary of the birth of this blighted 
land. May the 56th year bring us, for a much needed change, a bit 
of peace and prosperity.

<a name="road">Roadmap to nowhere</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

Why does nothing sound strange or novel in Pakistan anymore? Is it 
that we have exhausted all tricks and have to make do with the 
endless repetition of old ones? Or is it that the cynicism born of 
our cumulative experiences has killed all enthusiasm?

No road in Pakistan is more extensively travelled on than the one 
leading back to democracy. At the same time, no road is more 
signposted with the crucifixion of hope than this one. It is not in 
our military coups that we have betrayed ourselves so much as in 
our return marches to democracy. If every coup has kindled the 
irrational emotionalism which forms so strong a part of our 
national character, the aftermath of every coup has gifted us a 
fresh set of problems, more complicated and intractable than those 
originally meant to be solved.

What makes General Musharraf think he is an exception? He is 
travelling down the same road as his predecessors. What makes him 
think that unlike them he will reach the golden kingdom? His 
methods are the same, his philosophy similar. The smart uniform he 
proudly wears and the impressive array of medals which adorn his 
chest would fit any of the three military saviours whose shades 
have preceded him. Yet he thinks he is different, that somehow he 
can break the cycle of cause-and-effect. He has a strong faith in 
himself. So did all his predecessors.

After 'good governance' there is no phrase more calculated to make 
a cynic reach for his pistol than 'roadmap to democracy'. So many 
roadmaps we have had that to put them all together would make a 
venerable archive. Yet as if there was room for more we have 
received another one which looks, feels and smells like all 
previous ones. Why should it lead to different results?

In three years Hitler (a bad example but I am making a different 
point) had brought about the economic recovery of Germany and 
readied it for the greatest war in history. In three years from 
Pearl Harbour the United States went from huge military setback to 
the brink of victory. In three years, starting from the Musharraf 
coup in '99, all we will have achieved is a return to a pock-marked 
democracy, with an overbearing president, a cowed and subservient 
parliament, dazed political parties grateful for the crumbs thrown 
their way, and a people sick and tired of politics.

Does General Musharraf's roadmap to democracy, unfurled on August 
14, contain anything more? If it does it comes well disguised, at 
least for mortal eyes which can pick out nothing new. Time is not 
on our side. More than the wastage of water or the ravaging of the 
environment it is the wastage of time we cannot afford. The world 
is marching by while we are grappling with the ghosts of the past, 
fighting old battles and traversing the same highways over and over 
again. Yet all of Pakistan's military saviours have behaved as if 
eternity lay at their feet. General Musharraf's roadmap to 
democracy also treats time as a luxury.

In a setting such as Pakistan's the only justification for military 
rule is speed, efficiency and ruthlessness. In theory, what 
plodding civilian governments cannot deliver, the military can. But 
our own history shows that this theory is a fallacy. The Pakistan 
army is a conservative institution incapable - by training, 
background and ethos - to understand, let alone deliver, any kind 
of radical social or economic agenda. To state the obvious, it is 
not a people's army headed by a revolutionary leader like Mao or 
Castro. The examples of Ayub, Yahya and Zia amply demonstrate that 
when it steps into political waters it ends by muddying them 
further.

Why then such a long-drawn-out roadmap to democracy? What are the 
Ataturk reforms this government has initiated that it seeks to 
protect them from future repudiation through constitutional 
safeguards? If the military's idea of national renewal is Mian 
Azhar, Chaudry Shujaat Hussain and the newly-elected district 
nazims, why put the entire nation through a form of Chinese 
torture? After winter comes spring, after the darkness of night the 
light of the rising sun. After General Musharraf's roadmap to 
democracy, what?

It took General Musharraf a full year to change his tune towards 
India. It took him two years to understand the harm being done to 
the country's image by the posturing of the religious right (hence 
his path-breaking speech to an assembly of clerics on the occasion 
of the Holy Prophet's birthday this year). It has taken all the 
strength and wisdom of the corps commanders, the highest patriotic 
body in Pakistan, to settle for a safe breed of district nazims.

It has taken the military government two years to wake up to the 
danger posed by the Lashkar-i-Jhangvi and the Sipah-i-Muhammad. 
Even then the decision it has taken is largely an academic one. 
While the two organizations have been banned, no real victories can 
be claimed in the fight against sectarian terrorism. In the passing 
of tough laws Pakistani governments have never been found wanting. 
It is in translating words into action that their problems arise.

It will take another year for the perfection of a democratic order 
which does not ruffle the feathers of the military. It will take 
another two years after that for the military and the new civilian 
set-up to learn to coexist with each other. That is, if fresh 
tensions do not crop up and like so many systems before, the one 
being fashioned now does not crumble under the strain of its 
internal contradictions. Can Pakistan afford to play these games? 
Do we know where we stand? Do we have an adequate measure of our 
problems?

Pakistan's most pressing need is not to reinvent the past but to 
reinvent itself. We may have a flattering image of ourselves but 
others do not see us in the same light. We are seen as a country 
which has betrayed its promise, which is living in the past and is 
unable to forge ahead. The extravagance of previous years has 
turned us into an international beggar. We have foreign policy 
pretensions which are out of sync with our resources. We continue 
to live beyond our means.

These are not insuperable problems. Other countries have lived 
through worse times and come out of them successfully. There is no 
reason why we should be overwhelmed. But for success we will have 
to follow a different tack. We have to get out of the cycle of 
military coups and flawed democracy. If the army cannot eschew the 
temptation of political interference Pakistan will never attain 
political stability. And without this prerequisite all plans for 
national renewal will remain stalled.

Islam is not on the line and never will be. At issue is our place 
in the modern world. Can we break our begging bowl? Can we give our 
people the basic necessities of decent living? Can we turn the 
ingenuity we have shown in making nuclear weapons into other 
fields? Can we learn to value education and knowledge for their own 
sake? Can we begin to understand the importance of the arts? Music, 
sculpture, painting, dance are no threat to anyone's morals. They 
dignify and adorn human existence. Worse than anything physical is 
the Talibanization of the spirit. Once that happens the capacity of 
the human soul to soar and search for the stars is lost.

All this is not a cry of despair. It should be seen as a summons to 
action. Only when we realize the depth of our problems can we 
fashion the correct responses to them. Given the extent of our 
problems, what we need is Herculean action compressed into a tight 
time scale. What we are getting from this latest attempt at 
national redemption is a long march to nowhere.

<a name="accs">ACC sets Aug 23 deadline for India: Pakistan hopeful </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW DELHI, Aug 16: The four-nation Asian Test Championship will go 
ahead even without India, which may not be able to participate 
because of a government order banning it from playing Pakistan, a 
top cricket official said.

"Obviously, the championship will lose much of its glamour if India 
pulled out," Asian Cricket Foundation (ACF) chairman Jagmohan 
Dalmiya told a news conference in the eastern Indian city of 
Kolkata. "But cricket has to go on. It is desirable that all four 
countries play since the world is looking forward to this meet."

The championship is scheduled to bring together Bangladesh, India, 
Pakistan and Sri Lanka and would be played at different venues 
between September and February. India have refused to participate 
in any bilateral cricket series with Pakistan, whom they accuse of 
backing cross-border terrorism.

"The Indian board has been asked to confirm whether they will play 
in the championship by Aug 23. We are hopeful of a favourable 
response," Dalmiya said. He said Indian board secretary Jaywant 
Lele had been invited to attend the ACF conclave to discuss the 
issue.

"The board was expecting to get the clearance from the Indian 
government by Monday," he said. He said the Asian Cricket Council, 
which organises the event, was willing to "bend backwards" and 
extend the participation deadline by two more days to India, 
provided the whole schedule was not disrupted. India's sports 
minister Uma Bharati said last week she had to seek clearance from 
other government ministries for allowing India's participation.

"The final decision will be taken by the external affairs ministry, 
to whom I will be giving my views," she said. Pakistan are to host 
the Test against India, the first between the two nations in the 
country since India's four-match tour in 1989-90.

India had cancelled a scheduled cricket tour of Pakistan in 
December and then pulled out of the Sharjah series in the Gulf.-AFP

<a name="show">Show must go on even without India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The fate of the Asian Test Championship seems to be hanging by a 
thread as we await the decision of the Indian Government whether it 
will allow its team to play against Pakistan. The Indian Government 
has blown hot and cold on this and one wonders whether it is just 
indecisiveness or whether it is a kind of teasing.

The Indian government does not appear to have any objections to its 
teams playing against Pakistan in other games. It seems to be stuck 
on cricket. Is there anything particularly sinister about cricket 
that it should be singled out?

Cricket has become a secular religion in the subcontinent and so, 
probably, qualifies as a special case though it does appear to be 
far-fetched. Whatever reasons the Indian government may have, in 
one very real sense, it is punishing its own people who must be 
looking forward to the rivalry between the teams of the two 
countries, a rivalry, let me hasten to add, that is healthy and 
never been the cause of any disturbances. 

Surely the Indian Government must know that its team will be 
received warmly. Perhaps, even the Wagah border could be opened to 
allow Indian visitors to watch the match. Lahore is a city with a 
big heart. But the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) cannot wait 
indefinitely for India and I would suggest that there should be a 
cut-off date. Either India is in or it is out.

The Asian Test Championship will be considerably devalued without 
India. But the show must go on. The Asian Test Championship can 
become the centre-piece of regional cricket. But it should not be 
held hostage by any one country. I have a gut reaction that India 
will come to Lahore but then not all my hunches are right. The 
Indian government should also realise that two other countries are 
involved in the Asian Test Championship, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

<a name="wasi">Wasim included but Moin ignored</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 16: Pakistan cricket selectors named Wasim Akram for 
the two-day practice match scheduled at the National Stadium on Aug 
20 and 21. However, there was no place for former captain Moin Khan 
who has been overlooked after having played in Aug 14 one-dayer.
Moin scored 13 and accounted for three batsmen behind the wickets.

Wasim is the only outsider in the two teams composed from the 27 
probables named on July 31 for the training camp currently in 
progress at the National Stadium. The other missing boys are the 
injured duo of Shabbir Ahmad and Mohammad Sami, Shahid Afridi and 
Saqlain Mushtaq who are playing in English county championships.

Wasim has been included after enormous pressure on the selectors 
following his exclusion from the camp. As regards Moin, he had been 
dismissed as captain and then overlooked for the tour to England as 
the PCB claimed he was unfit. Nevertheless, PCB's panel of doctors 
gave him a clean bill of health on April 22 which has yet to be 
considered by the selectors.

Just to recall, the chairman of selectors Wasim Bari had said Wasim 
and Moin would be given opportunity to prove their fitness and form 
before they are considered for selection. Wasim has been provided 
with that opportunity but Moin has been denied. It appears that the 
two-day fixture is an attempt to include Wasim in the team and end 
the controversy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 15: Wasim Akram got a word of encouragement and 
support from Australian fast bowling coach Daryl Foster who said 
the left-armer was brilliant in his last Test against England.

Foster, who also helped Pakistan quickies on the two-Test and one-
day series tour in May-June, said Wasim bowled impressively in the 
Old Trafford Test which Pakistan won. "He was mean and nasty as he 
has ever been. I think Wasim and Waqar were very good combination," 
Foster told reporters at the National Stadium. Wasim was not 
considered to be one of the 27 by the selectors for a training camp 
currently under progress at the National Stadium.

"I don't think he's out of frame by any means. I also don't think 
anyone has written him off. They would be very silly to write off a 
champion and Wasim is a champion," Foster said. Wasim, who has 440 
one-day and 419 Test wickets, is under microscope after he finished 
just two full home series in the last six years. His only complete 
series' were against Zimbabwe and the West Indies in 1997-98. 
Ironically, those were the only times in six years he skippered 
Pakistan in a home series. Foster admitted that it was not his 
business to comment on Pakistan selection matters but stressed that 
he bowled excellently at Old Trafford without being rewarded for 
his hard work.

The 65-year-old, who is on a two-week assignment, also expressed 
his disagreement with International Cricket Council's procedures to 
tackle issues relating to throwing and which resulted in the 
suspensions of Shoaib Akhtar, Shabbir Ahmad, Muttiah Muralitharan 
and Brett Lee. "With throwing, you can't leave it to the umpire's 
naked eye. I don't think any umpire is able to be a definite judge 
on that," he remarked.

He said in the cases of Shoaib and Muralitharan, the ICC should 
have said that since the two had indifferent bowling actions, the 
bowling committee needed to have a look at them on slow 
motion/video and seek advice from its experts. "It was later proved 
that they had unique physical characteristics which umpires were 
unable to put up."

Nevertheless, Foster had a word of advice for Shoaib Akhtar whom he 
described as a unique talent. "He has got to realize that cricket 
is not about bowling one ball at 100mph. Its about 15 overs in a 
day and be able to come back next day and do the same again. The 
team requires a bowler to keep producing over after over."

Foster declared that Shabbir's bowling action was fine and he was 
just ready to stage a comeback after overcoming injury. "I don't 
think the way he's bowling now, he has any problem. I don't think 
he has lost pace. He's six feet five inches and bowls from an 
enormous height. I would be surprised if he doesn't press claims 
for Pakistan team."

KARACHI, Aug 13: Wasim Akram will miss the first practice match of 
the three-game series after delaying his arrival, officials said. 

The PCB have yet to announce Wasim's replacement and captain though 
Moin Khan appears to be an automatic choice. Wasim's absence leaves 
Moin and Mushtaq Ahmad as the only stars appearing on Tuesday after 
being overlooked for the training camp which is currently in 
progress at the National Stadium. However, there has been severe 
difference of opinion on the hosting of matches with the most valid 
point being raised - will the trio be considered for the 
forthcoming Test matches on the basis of one-day match performance.

<a name="inza">Inzamam may sue English paper</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 14: Inzamam-ul-Haq admitted his concentration has been 
distracted after his name was once again linked to betting and 
match-fixing. 

Talking to reporters at the National Stadium, Inzamam said he was 
willing to appear before any committee and face any punishment if 
there was any evidence to his wrong doings. "But stories and 
allegations without any substance and evidence to back them up are 
badly affecting my cricket, my family and my social life. 

Although the PCB has lifted my spirits and provided me the support 
a player requires in tough times, fact of the matter is that it 
will be in the back of my mind that if I score a duck again, 
fingers will be pointed," Inzamam argued.

An English newspaper (Sunday Telegraph) reported earlier this week 
that ICC's anti-corruption united wanted to interview Inzamam after 
his second-ball duck in the tri-nation one-day series in England.

The PCB has said it would not release Inzamam for interview until 
April next year but added that the English media might have mixed 
up the story. Inzamam said he met PCB chief in Karachi and inquired 
if the ACU had written anything to the PCB. "But the chairman has 
'Not'. I have also neither been called nor informed by the ACU. "I 
don't know from where these stories have appeared and what is the 
basis. Anyway, I have decided to take legal action against the 
newspaper and have already approached my brothers in England to 
engage a lawyer," Inzamam said.

The PCB said Tuesday it would assist and provide legal support to 
Inzamam if he approached them for help. "I have a clear mind and I 
have done nothing wrong. So why should my name be dragged around in 
such a manner. I mean batsman scores century and also get out on 
zero. But does it mean that every time he gets out for a duck he 
should be linked to match-fixing?"

<a name="afri">Afridi slams 68 off 30 balls </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, Aug 15: Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi blasted 68 off 
30 balls but could not stop Leicestershire Foxes losing their 
unbeaten record in county cricket's National League on Tuesday. 
Leicestershire, having won all nine of their previous games in 
division one of the 45 overs competition, were beaten by one run by 
Somerset Sabres at Taunton.

After Peter Bowler (104) and Ian Blackwell (86) shared an opening 
stand of 163 to spur Somerset to 263 for seven, Afridi led the 
Leicestershire chase in a whirlwind innings containing 12 fours and 
three sixes. The Pakistani, who had lashed 95 off 58 deliveries in 
the Cheltenham and Gloucester Trophy semifinal against Lancashire 
on Monday, was missed on 22 and 55 before he fell to a catch at 
deep mid-wicket.

Wicketkeeper Neil Burns subsequently took up the challenge against 
his former county with an unbeaten 59 off 61 balls that took 
Leicestershire desperately close to success. Needing 16 off the 
final over, Leicestershire ended just two runs short of their 
target at 262 for nine, but stay top of the nine-team table.

However, Leicestershire's lead was cut from six points to two by 
second-placed Kent Spitfires when they beat Surrey Lions by 43 runs 
in a day-night match at Canterbury - Reuters.
