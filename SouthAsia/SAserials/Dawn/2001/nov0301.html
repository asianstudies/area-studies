<a name="mush">Musharraf-Vajpayee meeting in Kathmandu likely</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Nov 2: Almost like a one-day cricket match, the leaders 
of India and Pakistan are keeping the world tantalized about an as-
yet-possible last minute meeting that everyone who is not a 
rightwing Hindu hardliner wants them to have in New York this 
month, although the official word from the Indian capital on Friday 
spoke of Kathmandu, in the first week of January, as the only 
confirmed rendezvous so far.

Indian foreign secretary Chokila Iyer told a news conference that 
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President Pervez Musharraf 
would be in the Nepali capital in January to attend a much delayed 
meeting of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.

Significantly, both leaders are scheduled to address the UN General 
Assembly and separately meet US President George W. Bush too, and 
both are believed to have kept some time free on Nov 11. Ms Iyer 
acknowledged that some meetings were being arranged for Mr Vajpayee 
on Sunday, the last day of his stay in New York. Significantly too, 
she did not deny that one of those meetings could involve a 
dignitary from Pakistan.

<a name="nucl">Nuclear secrets leakage reports trash, says Rashid</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Nov 2: The director-general of Inter-Service Public 
Relations, Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi, denied reports that two former 
"scientists" of Pakistan's nuclear program had leaked secrets to 
the Taliban or any other outsiders.

At the Foreign Office daily news briefing, he said the retired 
officers who now ran an NGO and had visited Afghanistan many times, 
were questioned by the secret services but they were now at their 
residences.

Maj-Gen Qureshi described the reports as "trash, fictitious and 
baseless".

<a name="nass">N-assets under foolproof controls: Sattar </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 1: Pakistan reassured the international community 
that its nuclear assets were under foolproof custodial controls, 
and brushed aside apprehensions about these falling into the hands 
of extremists.

"Dedicated formations of specially equipped forces have been 
deployed for ensuring the security of Pakistan nuclear 
installations and assets," Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar said in a 
statement read out at the daily briefing of the Foreign Office.

Foreign governments, he said, were aware of the security and 
protection of Pakistan's nuclear assets but some analyst were 
expressing fears, which, he added, were unfounded.

"In order to reassure the world community that Pakistan's strategic 
assets are under foolproof custodial controls, it is necessary to 
respond to concerns expressed in some foreign journals," Mr Sattar 
said.

Pakistan, he said, had an impeccable record of custodial safety and 
security free of any incident of theft or leakage of nuclear 
material, equipment or technology.

"The credit goes to the armed forces which are guardians of 
Pakistan's strategic assets," he said. Similarly, the Pakistan 
Atomic Energy Commission has an unblemished record of safety and 
security of the nuclear power plants and other civilian projects 
which are under safeguards, and subject to periodic inspections by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency.

He said the government had constantly maintained, developed and 
upgraded command and control systems and custodial security 
procedures. It had invested requisite financial and personnel 
resources in order to devise and apply ironclad measures to deal 
with all contingencies of threat to strategic assets, he added.

"Safe custody in storage is ensured by dedicated formations of 
specially equipped forces," he said. A strategic force command has 
been established for each of three armed services. Clear chains or 
responsibility have been prescribed and enforced to ensure that 
strategic weapons cannot be deployed without due authorization. 
Stringent measures have been enforced to minimize risks of 
accidental, unintentional or unauthorized launch.

Mr Sattar recalled that the government had established the 
strategic plans division as secretariat for the country's strategic 
programme. Under the direct command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of 
the armed forces, it developed and devised policies and procedures 
to ensure custodial security and command and control, and oversee 
their implementation. Its recommendations are considered and 
approved by the National Command Authority, which is headed by the 
president.

He said the armed forces of Pakistan are known for their 
professionalism, discipline and institutional strength. Any 
apprehension that the assets might fall into the hands of 
extremists was entirely imaginary, perhaps a product of distortions 
caused by TV images magnifying the sights and sounds of protesters.

"Demonstrations signifying compassion for innocent victims of stray 
bombs have been larger in Pakistan because of deep feelings of 
sympathy with the Afghan people with whom we share affinities of 
geography, history and culture. It is illogical to interpret such a 
natural reaction as danger to the stability of the state or the 
government," he said.

The minister disclosed that US Secretary of State Colin Powell had 
offered training for Pakistani experts for security and protection 
of nuclear assets, which, he said, had been accepted. He explained 
that Pakistani experts would be apprised of the security measures 
being applied by the United States.

<a name="paki">Pakistan ensuring no help reaches Afghanistan: US</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza

WASHINGTON, Nov 2: Senior US officials do not rule out the 
possibility that people in countries neighbouring Afghanistan may 
continue to have "unhelpful" dealings with the Taliban but believe 
that the Pakistan government is making every effort to make sure 
that no support goes to the Kabul regime.

This is the impression gathered after official statements here 
following allegations in newspaper reports that the Taliban have 
been receiving military, fuel and other supplies covertly from 
Pakistan, allegedly with the tacit support of elements in the 
intelligence services.

Pakistan and Afghanistan share a long and porous border that cannot 
always be effectively policed, and there has always been a thriving 
cross-border arms trade, with the so-called tribal areas awash with 
weapons. Other countries around Afghanistan have also had arms 
trading links with the Taliban.

Apparently reflecting understanding of this situation, Defence 
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld points out that states neighbouring 
Afghanistan have long histories and relationships, and says he does 
not "doubt for a minute that there are people in any number of 
those countries who have relationships and dealings across borders 
that are unhelpful to us". But, Mr Rumsfeld stressed at a Pentagon 
briefing, there was no question that Pakistan and the president of 
Pakistan and his government were "very much allied with us in this 
(anti-terrorism) effort and have been enormously supportive and 
helpful. So to suggest that it is a conscious effort on the part of 
the government would be a misunderstanding of the situation." He 
refused to say whether the issue would be discussed with Gen Pervez 
Musharraf "if and when" he meets the Pakistani leader.

National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice also struck more or less 
the same note, telling reporters at the White House that the US was 
getting "very good cooperation" from Pakistan, and that Islamabad 
was doing whatever it could to avoid a situation where help could 
be sent to the Taliban.

At the State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher said Pakistan 
had made every effort to prevent any aid of a military nature from 
going to the Taliban. He said: "We've excellent cooperation from 
Pakistan. We've got a lot of help and support in the campaign, and 
I think we have every indication that the Pakistani government will 
be trying to avoid anything like that (secret supplies). The 
Pakistani government has made every effort to make sure that no 
support goes to the Taliban."

<a name="newd">New Delhi threatens Islamabad with war</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Oct 31: Two days after fuming at the UN's peace monitor 
in Kashmir for accusing India and Pakistan of playing games with 
the troubled Himalayan region, India's army and prime minister were 
making threatening statements against Islamabad that appeared to 
vindicate, not allay, fears that bilateral tensions between the two 
nuclear neighbours could yet spin out of control.

On the one hand Lt Gen R K Nanvatty, GOC-in-C, Northern Command, 
warned that the Indian Army was prepared and would take military 
action against Pakistan if the need arose. On the other hand, Prime 
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee used a political rally to warn 
President Pervez Musharraf not to take India's patience for 
granted.

"The nuclearisation of the subcontinent may have altered the 
situation, but space still exists for limited conventional 
operations," General Nanavatty said in a meeting with reporters in 
Kashmir. "While every effort must be made politically, 
diplomatically and economically to deter Pakistan, we must remain 
prepared to exercise the military option."

<a name="four">Four vital objectives achieved, says CE</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Oct 31: President Gen Pervez Musharraf said that his 
government's principled support to the international effort for 
combating terrorism has helped Pakistan achieve four major 
important national objectives including assuring integrity and 
security of Pakistan.

Presiding over the cabinet meeting, he listed these objectives as 
integrity and security of Pakistan, safety of its strategic assets, 
avoiding any damage to the Kashmir cause and rehabilitation of the 
national economy. The meeting was also attended by the provincial 
governors.

President Musharraf emphasized that the diplomatic and economic 
gains accruing from Pakistan's principled policy far outweighed the 
material losses it was suffering during the current crisis in the 
region.

According to informed sources, the president said Pakistan has not 
gone for any quid pro quo or sought any deal for supporting the 
Americans to combat terrorism. He said he was happy to note that 
there was a growing realisation that Pakistan should be fully 
compensated through new access to markets as well as generous 
bilateral and multilateral support.

The US government has lifted the remaining sanctions against 
Pakistan, with Congress allowing President Bush to extend any 
financial support to Pakistan. There were reports that US was 
considering to offer one billion dollar to Pakistan. Washington and 
its coalition partners have already committed $800 million cash 
grant beside $600 million for Afghan refugees.

He said the people of Pakistan fully appreciated the efforts being 
made by the government to steer the country safely through these 
difficult times and prove to the world the responsible and 
progressive character of Pakistan. Pakistanis, he said, felt secure 
in the knowledge of being led by a government that believed in 
Pakistan first and everything else next.

Referring to his meetings with leaders from different countries who 
have visited Pakistan in the past weeks, the president said he took 
satisfaction in the fact that there was a broad understanding and 
appreciation of Pakistan's point of view on the current situation. 
He said a consensus was also visible on the issue of future 
political dispensation for Afghanistan and the rehabilitation of 
the country and its people. He said there was also a general 
consensus amongst the world leaders on the need for broad based 
multi-ethnic government in Afghanistan to manage the affairs of 
that country. He said the international community owed it to the 
people of Afghanistan as any political vacuum would lead to anarchy 
and atrocities against innocent people.

About the nature and the extent of the current action by the 
international coalition in Afghanistan, President Musharraf said it 
was in the interest of everyone that the operation comes to an 
early end. He, however, added that the conclusion of the current 
campaign depended on a number of factors. The president hoped that 
the miseries of the innocent Afghans would come to an early end as 
they have suffered more than enough over a period of two decades 
and deserved every help and support.

The Cabinet approved a draft ordinance with a view to streamlining 
the working of commercial courts. Under the new ordinance a 
commercial court shall consist of a chairman who is or has been 
either a session judge or a high court judge and two members to be 
appointed by the federal government from amongst:- 

a) The officers of federal government not below BS-19 to be 
nominated by the ministry of commerce and 

b) Businessmen or executives whose names appear on the panel of 
such persons to be drawn by the federal government in consultation 
with the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

The Cabinet granted ex post facto approval to an agreement on 
merchant shipping between the Government of Pakistan and the 
Government of Syrian Arab Republic. The agreement aims at 
strengthening bilateral relations and enhancing cooperation in the 
field of maritime sector.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 31: The president's spokesman emphatically said that 
no change in the cabinet by induction of politicians was 
contemplated and nothing of the sort had been discussed by Gen 
Pervez Musharraf in his recent interaction with political leaders.

The president's spokesman repudiated reports that the change was in 
the offing after President Musharraf had held a meeting with some 
members of the Quaid-i-Azam Muslim League led by Mian Azhar.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 30: The president's spokesman Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi 
refuted reports that nuclear scientists Sultan Bashiruddin Mehmood 
and Chaudhry Majeed had been handed over to the United States 
authorities.

"It is absolutely baseless and incorrect that they had been handed 
over to the FBI or CIA," Gen Qureshi said at a foreign office 
briefing. He denied reports that they were in government's custody. 
He said they had been questioned about their frequent visits to 
Afghanistan.

Gen Qureshi said that both these scientist had never been 
associated with the nuclear weapons development program during 
their service. He further said that Mr Mehmood had been indisposed 
so he had to be hospitalized.

<a name="news">New setup for Kabul, UN aid discussed: Musharraf-Brahimi talks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Oct 30: President Gen Pervez Musharraf met, separately, 
the special envoy of the UN secretary-general, Lakhdar Brahimi, and 
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers.

The discussion with Mr Brahimi remained focused on UN-sponsored 
process for setting up a broad-based government in Kabul; and the 
issue of providing humanitarian assistance to the refugees was 
discussed with Mr Lubbers, Foreign Office spokesman Aziz Khan said 
at the daily briefing.

The president's spokesman, Rashid Qureshi, was also present at the 
briefing

Mr Khan said the president in his talks with Mr Brahimi had 
underlined the need for setting in motion the peace process side by 
side with the military operation. He said it should also be 
followed by reconstruction of the war-ravaged country.

The president, he added, had also emphasized that unity, 
territorial integrity and stability should be preserved and the 
future political dispensation should reflect the demographic 
realities of Afghanistan.

He quoted President Musharraf as saying that the political 
dispensation should be allowed to emerge from within and must not 
be imposed from outside. The president, he said, had also put 
stress on shaping a plan for undertaking reconstruction of 
Afghanistan as soon as possible for bringing normalcy to the 
region. He called for focusing on reconstruction work in the area 
of land development and water management so that the agriculture 
base of the country "is developed and the Afghan refugees returned 
to their country."

Mr Brahimi, he said, had expressed appreciation of Pakistan's 
support to the UN peace process. He agreed that there was a need to 
accelerate political process as well as to prepare a comprehensive 
reconstruction plan for Afghanistan. Mr Lubbers, who also met 
Foreign Minister Abdus Sattar, discussed ways and means for 
ensuring adequate humanitarian assistance to Afghans displaced 
inside their own country.

He said there was a convergence of views on providing immediate 
assistance inside Afghanistan to avert a major human catastrophe.

The emphasis was on providing assistance to the Afghan people 
inside their country and setting up of more camps within the Afghan 
territory, he added.

Later, responding to a question about concern being expressed by 
the international community on setting up of camps inside the 
conflict zone, he said Pakistan had been very generous towards 
Afghan refugees in the past. He said no country in the world had 
played host to such a huge refugee population for such a long time. 
He said that till last year, only $13 a refugee a year had been 
contributed by the international community.

He also cited reports that there were approximately five to six 
million Afghan people who had been placed in vulnerable group. Such 
a huge number of people "cannot be granted asylum or accepted as 
refugees," he said, adding that it would be more prudent to provide 
them assistance inside Afghanistan.

<a name="unof">UN official sees political games in Kashmir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SRINAGAR, Oct 29: Tensions are increasing between Pakistan and 
India over along the Line of Control (LoC), with both countries 
"playing political games" that may need to be resolved by the 
United States, the head of the UN observation force here charged.

"My assessment is that the situation will become more tense in the 
time coming, not only along the LoC but also in the whole of Jammu 
and Kashmir state," said Maj Gen Hermann K. Loidolt, head of the UN 
Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).

Loidolt was also critical of India's consistent rejection of any 
third-party mediation over Kashmir.

"Without UN presence, the development of the situation could be 
unpredictable. If there would be no UNMOGIP here, in my opinion, in 
case of a new conflict, a new UN Security Council resolution and 
peacekeeping mission, in light of the standing Indian view, would 
be almost unimaginable."

In unusually blunt remarks, Loidolt said it was obvious there were 
"games both parties are playing with this tormented country". 
"Whatever the reason is for playing political games, may it be a 
diversionary manoeuvre on the Pakistani side to make India the real 
enemy instead of the US, or may it be the dawning of the next 
election in India, it will be an issue for the US to solve," 
Loidolt said.

"We all know there is no easy solution and especially that war is 
absolutely no solution for the issue of Kashmir," he added, in a 
statement read out to reporters.

Loidolt's statement marks the first time the UNMOGIP has taken a 
political stand on the Kashmir dispute.

The chief military observer stressed that UNMOGIP had no connection 
to the US, but noted that Washington may be able to play a role in 
the dispute.-AFP

WASHINGTON, Oct 29: The United States said there was no truth in a 
story published in an American journal that a special US unit was 
training with Israeli commandos to take out Pakistan's nuclear 
weapons in case of a coup against President Pervez Musharraf.

The story, by Seymour Hersh, appears in this week's issue of the 
New Yorker magazine. It quotes both serving and retired US 
officials as sources. But, asked to comment on it, a senior State 
Department official refuted the story and said there was no truth 
in it.

The official added that the US believed Pakistan was well aware of 
securing whatever nuclear components, materials and facilities it 
had and was confident that steps were in place to secure the safety 
of these assets.

Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Nov 2: The Karakoram Highway is open for traffic as there 
is no hurdle on way in shape of resistance or processions, the NWFP 
government said on Friday.

In a press statement here on Friday evening, a spokesman for the 
NWFP government made it clear that the Karakurram Highway "is 
completely open for general traffic. "There is no one on the 
highway to resist or to take a procession," it adds. The statement,

<a name="tosu">Pakistan to support US until aims are met: CE</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, Oct 27: President Pervez Musharraf said he was determined 
to continue his support for the US-led military campaign in 
Afghanistan until the coalition's aims were achieved, a British 
daily reported on Saturday.

"Any military campaign has to set objectives and those objectives 
need to be attained," Musharraf told The Times. "You can't cut a 
military campaign mid-way without achieving them. Then it would be 
failure," he added.

"We haven't set any limits. We are part of the coalition. The 
reality on the ground needs to be constantly assessed. But my 
assessment is that we go on until the objectives are achieved," he 
said. However, he warned that as the campaign continued the greater 
would be the toll of civilian casualties and the more public 
support, not only in the Islamic world, would wane.

"The operation must be as short as possible," he said. "We must try 
to achieve our objectives through military means, and if we are 
unable to do that within a certain duration, switch to a political 
strategy that would give us the same objectives," he added.

<a name="uspl">US plans big aid package for Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NEW YORK, Oct 27: The Bush administration has put together an aid 
package for Pakistan that is likely to total several billion 
dollars and includes sweeping debt rescheduling, grants stretching 
over many years and trade benefits for its support to the US-led 
coalition against terrorism, the New York Times said in a report.

The aid envisaged by Washington would make Pakistan the largest 
recipient of American aid after Israel and Egypt, the paper said. 
The NYT said that talks between officials of the State and Treasury 
departments and Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz had resulted in an 
agreement that the administration would work to secure four types 
of aid for Pakistan, the administration officials said.

These include grants from the United States and other allies. In 
addition, the Bush administration is using its influence to support 
new loan programs by the IMF and the World Bank, including an anti-
poverty loan worth about $500 million from the IMF and possibly a 
line of credit, at higher rates, of about $1 billion.

The United States has already begun calculating how to reschedule 
payments on the $3 billion Pakistan owes Washington. It has urged 
allies to do the same, and Britain has already followed suit. 
Bilateral loans total about $12 billion out of the country's $38 
billion foreign debt, the paper said.

Pakistan may also secure a higher quota or lower tariffs for its 
textile exports to the United States.

One senior administration official said the United States would, 
however, monitor closely how the money is used. But the official 
also acknowledged that Washington would support Pakistan's bid to 
get some extraordinary benefits, the paper said.

While Pakistan is unlikely to receive all the concessions it now 
seeks, the administration's package amounts to the largest 
mobilization of low-interest loans and debt relief since allies 
showered benefits on Egypt during the Persian Gulf War, the paper 
said. Pockets of opposition are already becoming visible in 
Washington, among non-governmental organizations and, more quietly, 
in Japan.

Japan recently rejected Pakistan's request to forgive the entire $5 
billion. Tokyo has agreed, however, to delay payments on about $500 
million in Pakistani debt.

Some American lawmakers say the Bush administration may have too 
readily agreed to give Pakistan about $600 million in cash this 
year and next without a reliable way of ensuring that the money 
would be used to improve health and education rather than to 
underwrite the military expenses.

<a name="toal">Pakistan to allow more Afghan refugees</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 30: Pakistan has agreed to allow more Afghan 
refugees to enter its borders following an understanding reached 
with the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR). This 
understanding came when UNHCR chief, Ruud Lubbers, met president 
General Pervez Musharraf.

Speaking at a news conference Mr Lubbers said that site 
preparations were underway to accommodate up to 300,000 refugees in 
Pakistan initially, but around one million were expected to take 
refuge in Pakistan if the conflict in Afghanistan prolonged.

Referring to his meeting, Mr Lubbers said that President Musharraf 
had agreed to allow entry to three broad categories of Afghans.

First, humanitarian cases including the sick, women, children and 
the elderly; secondly, illegal Afghans who entered post September 
11 would not be deported but allowed to settle in refugee camps, 
and thirdly, the "hardship cases."

Mr Lubbers said that the UNHCR was asked to set up camps on the 
Afghan side of the border. However, the president was told that it 
was not feasible considering the security situation in Afghanistan 
as a number of young Afghans could face forced conscription by 
warring factions, the UNHCR chief said.

He said president Musharraf expressed concern over the burden of 
three million Afghan refugees already in the country. "His concerns 
are genuine and the UNHCR will facilitate resettlement of Afghans 
once the situation returns to normal," Mr Lubbers said.

<a name="toge">Pakistan to get 'permanent debt relief'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawaid Bokhari

KARACHI, Oct 27: Pakistan is likely to get "permanent debt relief" 
from Paris Club due to meet in December that would reduce the huge 
bilateral debts to sustainable levels.

Sources here said that Pakistan is seeking permanent re-profiling 
of debt by the Paris Club to reduce its debt servicing burden, 
which would be on better terms than short-term debt rescheduling it 
has so far got under the Housten terms.

Pakistan is not looking for debt write-off under Heavily Indebted 
Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) although, technically, it would 
qualify for this facility. The sources here said that the debt 
relief will be provided on the basis of net present value (NPV) of 
the current debt stock of $12 billion. The bilateral donors are 
generally expected to reschedule obligations, with a 80-90 per cent 
reduction in the net present value.

According to the IMF, the face value of the external debt stock is 
not a good measure of a country's debt burden if a significant part 
of it has been obtained on concessional terms with an interest rate 
below the prevailing market rate.

The debt-relief will be preceded by the Poverty Reduction and 
Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement between Pakistan and the IMF 
just weeks before the meeting of the Paris Club. The PRFG will make 
Pakistan eligible for debt relief.

Apart from the IMF's own commitment, the PRFG fiscal package would 
indicate pledges from World Bank, Asian Development Bank and 
traditional bilateral donors. Another PRGF component would be debt 
relief.

The sources said that Pakistan was now working with the IFIs and 
the bilateral donors on a five-point agenda to obtain a range of 
concessions. 

These are: 1) Permanent re-profile of bilateral debt so as to 
reduce the debt servicing burden, 2) to obtain concessional loans 
and grants from bilateral and multilateral donors, 3) to finance 
the expenditure associated with Afghan campaign out of exceptional 
grants from coalition partners, 4) to raise the spending on 
education, health, poverty reduction and job creation, 5) to 
increase Pakistan's access to EU and US markets by removal of 
tariff and quota restrictions.

<a name="imfp">IMF, Paris Club to fill $8bn gap</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 27: The International Monetary Fund and the Paris 
Club have assured Pakistan to fill $8 billion financing gap during 
the next three years in order to provide a major relief to the 
economy of the country.

"We have reached a broad understanding with the IMF and the Paris 
Club for filling Pakistan's $8 billion financing gap through 
generous bilateral and multilateral support by 2004", said Minister 
for Finance Shaukat Aziz.

Speaking at a joint news conference along with Minister for 
Commerce Razak Daud here on Saturday, the finance minister termed 
his visit to Paris very productive and meaningful to help improve 
the country's economy.

He said he had held detailed meetings with Paris Club's President 
and the IMF senior Director Paul Shabrier on rescheduling 
Pakistan's debt and getting Poverty Reduction Growth Facility 
package respectively. "The good thing is that the IMF board will 
meet on Dec 5 to consider and approve the PRGF, and the Paris Club 
is meeting on Dec 12 to get our loans rescheduled", Mr Aziz said. 
The draft report of the IMF, he pointed out, has been provided to 
the government about the PRGF.

He said he was leaving for Tokyo on Monday as the special envoy of 
President Pervez Musharraf to have an increased economic 
cooperation with Japan. He said it was a welcoming gesture that 
Japan has lifted international sanctions against Pakistan.

"I would discuss with the Japanese authorities the issue of debt 
relief and at the same time pursue for the resumption of annual 400 
to 500 million dollar assistance for Pakistan", he said. 
Nevertheless, he said, he still had to discuss the modalities of 
the assistance whether it will be in the shape of Official 
Development Assistance (ODA) or in shape of any other funding 
package.

Mr Aziz did not offer any comment when asked by a journalist that 
whether the government of Pakistan will sign the Comprehensive Test 
Ban Treaty (CTBT). "The issue of non-proliferation is very 
important but we can discuss this issue with you some other time", 
he added.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 28: Germany agreed on Sunday to provide 150 million 
Deutschmark(DM) financial support to Pakistan that includes DM 50 
million economic aid and DM 100 million debt- equity swap for two 
years.

Besides this, DM 100 million will be made available through Hermez 
Bank as supplier's credit. Germany will also assist Pakistan in 
getting financial support and debt relief from multilateral and 
bilateral forums. Germany has also declared Pakistan "the priority-
partner country", said Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Mr Aziz, the German 
Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, Heidemarie 
Wieczorek-Zeul, said the two sides had discussed all areas of 
development cooperation, including economic and financial support 
for Pakistan from international financial institutions, the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

She said her country appreciated Pakistan's initiatives for poverty 
reduction, and offered its services to support Pakistan's efforts.

The German minister said her country had already provided DM 70 
million for Afghan refugees and another DM 15 million would be 
added to this amount.

Mr Aziz said that over $1 billion German debt could be turned into 
grant if new human development projects were launched by Pakistan. 
He said Germany had revived economic aid to Pakistan and, as a 
first step, would provide DM 50 million under this head. In 
addition to this, Germany had offered DM 50 million debt equity 
swap for the current year and another DM 50 million for the next 
year for utilization in investment, education and health sectors, 
he said. This amount, he added, Pakistan used to pay back but since 
this would be used for human development, it would be converted 
into grant.

Mr Aziz said that another DM 100 million would be provided by 
Hermez Bank and this amount could be increased according to 
requirements.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 29: The State Bank said that National Development 
Finance Corporation (NDFC) will stand amalgamated with the state-
run National Bank from (November 1). The central bank said the 
government had approved the scheme of amalgamation.

The SBP said in a press release that from Nov 1 all the NDFC 
depositors would be free to withdraw full amount standing to their 
credit as on August 27 minus any withdrawal that they had made 
since then.

On August 27 the government had slapped a moratorium on the NDFC to 
prepare it for amalgamation with the NBP. The step was taken in the 
wake of "colossal losses suffered by the corporation during recent 
years."

The SBP had then allowed small depositors, trusts and welfare 
institutions to withdraw up to Rs 250,000 from their suspended 
accounts. The NDFC sources say a little less than Rs4 billion has 
so far been withdrawn by more than 30,000 depositors.

Under amalgamation scheme "the assets and liabilities of the NDFC 
will be transferred to the NBP as on October 31, 2001 to offset the 
losses sustained by the NDFC. "Under this scheme the federal 
government and the State Bank have decided to write off Rs15.86 
billion worth of loans/credit to fill in the gap between the assets 
and liabilities of the corporation. The SBP release says though 
depositors are allowed to make withdrawals from their deposits from 
November 1, they also have the choice to negotiate with the NBP for 
availing any of its investment schemes.

<a name="boom">Boom-like conditions imminent on bourses</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Aslam

The market's spectacular performance was well reflected in a 13 per 
cent increase in the KSE 100-share index and Rs30 billion growth in 
the market capitalization at Rs343 billion, followed by a price 
flare-up in the leading blue chips, notably Adamjee Insurance, the 
PSO, Shell Pakistan, Hub-Power, Nestle MilkPak, Lever Brothers, 
Attock Refinery and several others.

The market advance was, however, led by the PTCL on massive buying 
ahead of the board meeting and the Hub-Power on reports that its 
board will meet on Nov 5 and may declare a final dividend of 30 per 
cent plus an interim, for the next year. The earning per share is 
rumoured around Rs8 to 9 on an estimated profit of Rs11 billion.

After breaking the barrier of 1,300 and 1,400 points, the increase 
in the KSE 100-share index finally ended at 1,401.51 after 
partially reacting to 1,363.00 on late weekend selling. The total 
market capitalization swelled by Rs30 billion to Rs343 billion.

Two per cent cut in the discount rate by the central bank to 10 per 
cent was widely welcomed as it triggered strong speculative support 
from all and sundry but what seems to have generated general buying 
from most of the genuine investors was the perception of a robust 
economy if all the aid promised by the western world pours in and 
the hopes of foreign debt write-off materializes.

"The bank credits may not be that cheaper as the speculative forces 
make them look like as only post-cut weeks will show how the 
lenders treat their clientele but the reaction was positive and in 
line with the future investor-perception", stock analysts at the WE 
financials predict. A 13 per cent increase in the index, which 
raised the total gain to 20 per cent during the last couple of 
weeks, may owe its strength to some solid insider information not 
shared by the local leading foreign fund managers but followed the 
lead more actively as was reflected by a large single-session 
volume of 275 million shares, they say.

The 13 per cent rise in the index means an increase of over Rs30 
billion at Rs343 billion in the total market capitalization, 
although it needs a dozen more such pushes to attain its pre-
reaction level of Rs610 billion touched in the mid-90s boom. 
However, the increase added to the savings of small investors 
significantly.

The index finally breached through the two psychological barrier of 
1,300 and 1,400 points as compared to 1,267.05 at the last weekend. 
Volume soared to a recent peak level of 1 billion shares. The 
highest-ever figure is 500 million shares in a session recorded 
couple of years back.

It was a big rise in the backdrop of the war-like conditions but 
not the largest as the market has on its record half a dozen single 
session gains of well over 100 points including the highest some 
years back.

"The market virtually witnessed a scramble for the blue chips at 
the current levels reminiscent of boom conditions as both the bulls 
and the bears have joined hands to demonstrate that the bull-run 
will prevail", Salman Ahmad a stock analyst at the Finex Securities 
say.

It was a judicious blend of massive local as well as foreign 
buying, reflecting that no one among them was inclined to miss the 
rising market at the prevailing attractively lower levels, although 
it was terribly selective and did not go beyond certain blue chips 
shares, he adds.

Apart from the big cut in the discount rate, which could well lead 
to cheaper credit lines for the investors, expectations of a big 
aid package as promised by the various visiting western ministers 
to compensate for the economic losses because of the US and allies 
attacks on Afghanistan against war on terrorism kept the market 
morale terribly bullish, he adds.

"It was not a single positive factor, which triggered the buystops 
from all and sundry but a combination of stimulating news, which 
did not allow the investors to sit on the sidelines", stock 
analysts at the Alireza and the Moosani Securities commenting on 
the market's spectacular upward journey say.

The reports of higher final dividend by the Hubco management, 
worrying results from the PTCL and a relative slowdown in the US 
attacks on Afghanistan, which investors think could lead to 
ceasefire in the coming days. But the 20 per cent interim dividend 
by the Engro Chemical (20 per cent interim already paid), fell 
below the market expectations as was reflected by the late selling 
in its shares.

The big gainers were led by the Millat Tractors, Gul Ahmed 
Textiles, Liberty Mills, the PSO, Al-Ghazi tractors, Glaxo-Wellcome 
Pakistan and the Nestle MilkPak. But the biggest price flare-up was 
noted in Shell Pakistan, Lever Brothers and Wyeth Pakistan. All 
other shares also rose under the lead of textiles and energy 
sector.

The trading volume soared to 1.301 billion shares after about a 
year owing to heavy trading in the PTCL and the Hub-Power, which 
together accounted for 75 per cent of the total.

Other actives were led by the PSO, the ICI Pakistan, Adamjee 
Insurance, Engro Chemical, Fauji Fertiliser, Sui Northern, the MCB,

<a name="buyi">Buying in leading scrips lifts index by 21.94 points</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 2: The buying flurry was so strong on the selected 
counters, notably PTCL, that at one stage it lifted the KSE 100-
share index well above the barrier of 1,400 points, although late 
selling allowed it to finish slightly below this level at 1,399.81, 
up 21.94 points from the overnight close of 1,377.87.

As widely speculated, the index is expected to settle well above 
the chart point of 1,400 as the relative strength of PTCL and 
Hubco, which together hold a weightage of 43 per cent in it will 
not allow to fall below this level.

The lower levels most of the leading equities have attained during 
the last couple of sessions sell-off provided an attractive bait to 
investors who covered positions in the pivotals such as PSO, Engro 
Chemical, Fauji Fertilizer and Sui Northern Gas. But ICI Pakistan 
came in for active selling after early sharp rise to Rs.52.35, the 
day's highest bid but finally ended lower by Rs.1.50 at Rs.49.35, 
off Rs.3 from the day's best rate.

Meanwhile, the Hub-Power management has announced that it has 
extended the date of book closure from Dec 22 to 30 in view of 
intervening holidays. Its share is currently being quoted on spot 
basis but continues to attract strong speculative buying in 
anticipation of higher final dividend when its board meets on Nov 
5, 2001.

Traded volume was light at 97m shares owing to Friday session but 
gainers forced a strong lead over the losers at 77 to 49, out of 
158 actives.

PTCL was actively traded, up 60 paisa at Rs.18.15 on 57 shares 
followed by PSO, higher by Rs.3.05 at Rs.109.10 on 9m shares, ICI 
Pakistan, off Rs.1.50 at Rs.49.35 on 6m shares, Hub-Power being 
quoted spot, up 70 paisa at Rs.23.20 on 6m shares and Sui Northern 
Gas, steady by 15 paisa at Rs.10.95 on 5m shares.

FUTURE CONTRACTS: Speculative issues on the forward counter also 
followed the lead of ready section under the lead of PTCL, which 
showed a sympathetic rise on large volume. Hubco, Fauji Fertilizer, 
PSO and Engro Chemical followed it.

BOARD MEETINGS: Berger Paints Pakistan, Karam Ceramics, Frontier 
Ceramic, Pioneer Cables, B.F. Modaraba, all on Nov 8, Trust 
Modaraba, on Nov 9, Millat Tractors, and Bolan Casting on Nov 12, 
and Pakistan Services Nov 14.

<a name="afgh">Afghanistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

Back in the 1960s someone described Islamabad as being half the 
size of Arlington cemetery and twice as dead. Whoever it was had 
obviously read and borrowed from "Dust in the Lion's Paw" written 
by the English traveler and writer Freya Stark and published in 
1961, for in her book, reproducing a letter she had written in 
1945, she had remarked: "Karachi, the Americans say, 'is half the 
size of Chicago cemetery and twice as dead'."

Karachi has changed, and so has the Islamabad of autumn 2001. It is 
stuffed to the brim with the world's media people, it is a hustling 
bustling city, and the atmosphere in its main hotel is highly 
reminiscent of Casablanca (but sadly there is no Rick's bar) in the 
early years of World War II.

This war now being fought will be a long drawn-out war. Those, such 
as President General Pervez Musharraf, who wish for a short, sharp 
encounter with a swift resolution will surely be disappointed. 
However, if the coalition does not manage to find Osama, there are 
hundreds of other bin Ladens on whom they can more easily lay 
hands, hundreds fuelled by ignorance in the guise of religion.

An illustrative story is told of Mulla Omar by those who went to 
visit him and try to persuade him not to upset members of the 
Buddhist faith, to leave the Bamiyan Buddhas alone, to tell him 
that they had been there long before the arrival of Islam, and that 
down the hundreds of years after the arrival of Islam no Muslim had 
objected to them. Omar's reply was that he wished he could leave 
them as they were, but that in a dream God had instructed him to 
destroy them, and that was that.

Experts on Afghanistan are many, experts on the Taliban are few. 
Many of the western embassies in Islamabad have dug out their old 
Afghan experts and sent for them so that they may be guided and 
informed. But all the old experts date back to the Afghanistan of 
the days of King Zahir Shah and of the Soviet occupation - none are 
versed in the ways of the Taliban. But we in Pakistan are 
fortunate; we have our own homegrown man, who knows the Taliban 
backwards, who has studied them and their terrible ways for 20 
years while covering Afghanistan as a reporter.

Ahmed Rashid's book 'Taliban - Islam, Oil and the New Great Game in 
Central Asia' took him 21 years to write. It was published in 2000 
by I B Taurus of London and New York when 3,000 copies rolled off 
their press. As recounts a Reuters' report of October 21, "The 
initial print run soon climbed as the hijacking by would-be Afghan 
refugees of an Ariana Airlines flight to London sparked a brief 
spurt of interest in Afghanistan. By September 11 this year, Rashid 
had been picked up by Yale University Press and more than 25,000 
copies had run off the presses. 'Taliban' had been translated into 
nine languages, including Japanese, Swedish, Dutch, Urdu and Dari - 
or Persian."

After the events of September 11 the print run in the US has soared 
to 350,000 copies and in Britain to 80,000 copies and, says 
Reuters: "Last week Ahmed's book on the once little-known 
fundamentalist militia hit number one on The New York Times 
bestseller list for paperback nonfiction, and after bobbing up and 
down on the list of the most popular books on sale by on-line 
retailer Amazon.com, it also hit the top spot there....

"The book gives a vivid account of the Taliban, based on numerous 
first-hand interviews and meetings, widespread travel over many 
years to Afghanistan and its neighbours, and describes the 
bewildering politics and ethnic mix that is Afghanistan..... In the 
prescient conclusion, Rashid issued a warning to the United States 
that their decision to abandon the Afghans to their own internecine 
and bloody battle for power after the Soviet threat disappeared 
with the withdrawal of their occupying forces in 1989 could return 
to haunt them...

"Today's policymakers are reading his book in a race for knowledge 
about the Islamic movement they ignored for so long. In Downing 
Street, British Prime Minister Tony Blair is said to refer to it, 
the book is a must-read at Japan's Foreign Ministry and German 
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer cites it in public."

Have our men in Pakistan even read it? And if so, have they 
attempted to learn from it? One chapter of the book is devoted to 
bin Laden and the training camps he has set up across Afghanistan. 
The ISI, struggling without success to provide intelligence 
information to their coalition partners, would do well to have a 
look at it. Ahmed himself says the value of the book is broader 
than just the Taliban, that it is a primer for the new Islamic 
radicalism now fast spreading.

Ahmed Rashid is himself quite clear on how Pakistan should now 
approach the issue of a post-Taliban Afghan government. He now 
concludes:

"We should not try to create another Pakhtoon alternative (such as 
Pir Sayed Ahmad Gailani or Jalaluddin Haqqani) as a rival to King 
Zahir Shah. We should go along with the king and try to deliver to 
him a strong Pakhtoon element. The international community will 
back the king, and if Musharraf and his government are seen to be 
at odds with them we will once again be isolated, unable to repair 
our relations with neighbours Iran, Russia, and the Central Asian 
states. We can reduce the influence of the Northern Alliance only 
if we are backed by the international community, and that means 
supporting the king. Pakistan and its national interest have 
nothing to fear from supporting Zahir Shah. He will not now be 
anti-Pakistan. Afghanistan has been destroyed to such an extent 
that no future government will be able to be anti-Pakistan.

"As it is, Pakistan has lost all credibility with all Afghans of 
all ethnic groups because of its gross interference, mismanagement 
and the insane short-sighted backing of the Taliban. To win the 
trust of the Afghans we must go along with what they and the 
international community want - and that basically is a king-led 
government.

"When the 800-odd Afghan Pakhtoon leaders met in Peshawar last 
Wednesday with the purpose of setting up a counter-weight to the 
non-Pakhtoon anti-Taliban United Front, the Pakistan-backed 
Gailani, said to be a 'moderate' spiritual leader, told them that 
he had met the king in Rome, had told him of the need to set up a 
'leadership council' of men who have the support of the majority of 
the Afghan people, and that the council would elect one member as 
chairman, and that member would certainly be the king. 

But, what Gailani did not tell them was that the king has already 
formed a 120-man council in alliance with the United Front, and 
that his next step would be to call a Loya Jirga and select a new 
government.

"The feeling of the king's men is that Pakistan is backing Gailani 
in an effort to bypass the king and the United Front, and that the 
Americans are going along with it as they need Pakistan for their 
military campaign.

"Meanwhile, leaders loyal to the king are busy trying to create 
some sort of anti-Taliban resistance in the Pakhtoon belt of 
southern Afghanistan, hoping to speed up the military operations 
and the creation of the Loya Jirga. They are having a tough time.

Neither the Americans nor the British are helping with money, 
equipment or supplies, and Pakistan's ISI has either lost its touch 
or is purposefully holding back help on the intelligence side. 
Pakistan needs to get into some sort of gear and deliver on its 
promise that it would create Taliban defectors. It has been unable 
to so far deliver anything and its western allies are surely 
getting impatient."

Such are the views of our Afghan man, for whatever they may be 
worth.

Whilst Ahmed Rashid is courted by the foreign media and by foreign 
diplomats, our government continues to ignore him. Truly amazing, 
for they should now be seeking counsel from wherever they can find 
it and from whoever can enlighten them, no matter how 
controversial.

<a name="cruc">Crucial phase yet to come</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Henry Kissinger

A new epoch in America's relations with the world began at 8:41 
a.m. on Sept. 11 when the first hijacked plane crashed into the 
World Trade Center. By imposing on America a sense of 
vulnerability, the attack also introduced the country to a new form 
of warfare - without battle lines and specific demands and not 
resolvable, as some wars are, by negotiation, only by victory.

The reaction has been defiant national unity. Partisan debate on 
foreign policy has been suspended. No significant disagreement 
exists on the strategy for defeating global terrorism put forward 
eloquently by President George W. Bush.

For all its shadowy nature, the new warfare permits a clear 
definition of what is needed to bring it under control. The 
terrorist attacks - from the hostages in Lebanon of the 1980s, to 
the bombed embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, and the 
crippled American destroyer in Yemen in 2000 - took place far away 
and while the United States was reluctant to put sustained pressure 
on the countries harboring terrorists.

In the new approach, the terrorists will be viewed in the proper 
perspective. They are ruthless but not numerous. They control no 
territory permanently. If their activities are harassed by the 
security forces of all countries - if no country will harbour them 
- they will become outlaws and increasingly obliged to devote 
efforts to elemental survival. If they attempt to commandeer a part 
of a country, as happened to some extent in Afghanistan and in 
Colombia, they can be hunted down by military operations. The key 
to anti-terrorism strategy is to eliminate safe havens.

These safe havens come about in various ways. In some countries, 
domestic legislation or constitutional restraints inhibit 
surveillance in the absence of demonstrated criminal acts, or 
prevent the transmittal of ostensibly domestic intelligence to 
other countries - as seems to be the case in Germany and, to some 
extent, in the United States. Remedial measures with respect to 
these situations are in train.

But the overwhelming majority of safe havens occurs when a 
government closes its eyes because it agrees with at least some of 
the objectives of the terrorists - as in Afghanistan, to some 
extent in Iran and Syria and, until recently, Pakistan. Even 
ostensibly friendly countries that have been cooperating with the 
United States on general strategy, such as Saudi Arabia, sometimes 
make a tacit bargain with terrorists so long as terrorist actions 
are not directed against the host government.

A serious anti-terrorism campaign must break this nexus. Many of 
the host governments know more than they have been prepared to 
communicate before Sept. 11. Incentives must be created for the 
sharing of intelligence. The anti-terrorism campaign must improve 
security cooperation, interrupt the flow of funds, harass terrorist 
communications and subject the countries that provide safe haven to 
pressures including, in the extreme case, military pressure.

In the aftermath of the attack on American soil, the Bush 
administration resisted arguments urging immediate military action 
against known terrorist centres, especially those that had 
supported previous terrorist attacks against Americans. The 
challenge is to guard against the temptation to treat cooperation 
on Afghanistan as meeting the challenge and to use it as an alibi 
for avoiding the necessary succeeding phases.

This is why military operations in Afghanistan should be limited to 
the shattering of the Taliban and the disintegration of the bin 
Laden network. Using military forces for nation-building would 
involve us in a quagmire comparable to what drained the Soviet 
Union. The conventional wisdom of creating a broad-based coalition 
to govern Afghanistan is desirable but not encouraged by the 
historical record.

The likely - perhaps optimum - outcome is a central Kabul 
government of limited reach while tribal autonomy prevails in the 
various regions. This essential enterprise should be put under the 
aegis of the United Nations, with generous economic support from 
the United States and other advanced industrial countries. A 
contact group could be created composed of Afghanistan's neighbors 
(minus Iraq), India, the United States and those NATO allies that 
participated in the military operations. This would provide a 
mechanism to reintroduce Iran to the international system, provided 
it genuinely abandons its support of terrorism.

The crucial phase of America's anti-terrorism strategy will begin 
as the Afghanistan military campaign winds down, and its focus will 
have to be outside Afghanistan. At that point, the coalition will 
come under strain. So far, the issue of long-term goals has been 
avoided by the formula that the members of the global coalition are 
free to choose the degree of their involvement.

A la carte coalition management worked well when membership 
required little more than affirming opposition to terrorism in 
principle. Its continued usefulness will depend on how coalition 
obligations are defined in the next phase. Should the convoy move 
at the pace of the slowest ship or should some parts of it be able 
to sail by themselves? If the former, the coalition effort will 
gradually be defined by the least-common-denominator compromises 
that killed the U.N. inspection system in Iraq and are on the verge 
of eliminating the U.N. sanctions against that country. 
Alternatively, the coalition can be conceived as a group united by 
common objectives but permitting autonomous action by whatever 
consensus can be created - or, in the extreme case, by the United 
States alone.

Those who argue for priority for the widest possible coalition - in 
other words, for a coalition veto - often cite the experience of 
the Gulf War. But the differences are significant. The Gulf War was 
triggered by a clear case of aggression that threatened Saudi 
Arabia, whose security had been deemed crucial by a bipartisan 
succession of American presidents.

The United States decided to undo Saddam's adventure in the few 
months available before the summer heat made large-scale ground 
operations impossible. Several hundred thousand American troops 
were dispatched before any attempt at coalition building was 
undertaken. Since the United States would obviously act alone if 
necessary, participating in the coalition became the most effective 
means for influencing events.

The direction of the current coalition is more ambiguous. President 
Bush has frequently and forcefully emphasized that he is determined 
to press the anti-terrorism campaign beyond Afghanistan. In due 
course, he will supplement his policy pronouncements with specific 
proposals. That will be the point at which the scope of the 
operational coalition will become clear. There could be 
disagreement on what constitutes a terrorist safe haven; what 
measures states should take to cut off the flow of funds; what 
penalties there are for non-compliance; in what manner, whether and 
by whom force should be used.

Just as in the Gulf War the pressures for American unilateral 
action provided the cement to bring a coalition together, so, in 
the anti-terrorism war, American determination and that of allies 
of comparable views are needed. A firm strategy becomes all the 
more important as biological weapons appear to have entered the 
arsenals of terrorism. Preventive action is becoming imperative. 
States known to possess such facilities and to have previously used 
them must be obliged to open themselves to strict, conclusive 
international inspections with obligatory enforcement mechanisms. 
This applies particularly to Iraq, with its long history of threats 
to all its neighbors and the use of chemical weapons, both against 
its neighbours and its own population.

The conditions of international support for a firm policy exist. 
For the attack on the United States has produced an extraordinary 
congruence of interests among the major powers. None wants to be 
vulnerable to shadowy groups that have emerged from Southeast Asia 
to the edge of Europe. Few have the means to resist alone. The NATO 
allies have ended the debate about whether, after the end of the 
Cold War, there is still a need for an Atlantic security structure.

Our Asian allies, Japan and Korea being democratic and 
industrialized, share this conviction. India, profoundly threatened 
by domestic Islamic fundamentalism, has much to lose by abandoning 
a common course. Russia perceives a common interest due to its 
contiguous Islamic southern regions. China shares a similar concern 
with respect to its western regions and has an added incentive to 
bring an end to global terrorism well before the 2008 Olympics in 
Beijing. Paradoxically, terrorism has evoked a sense of world 
community that has eluded theoretical pleas for world order.

In the Islamic world, attitudes are more ambiguous. Many Islamic 
nations, though deeply concerned about fundamentalism, are 
constrained by their public opinion from avowing public support, 
and a few may sympathize with some aspects of the terrorist agenda. 
An understanding American attitude toward traditional friends of 
America, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, is appropriate.

Their leaders are quite well aware that they have made compromises 
imposed on them by brutal domestic necessities. The administration 
clearly should make every effort to help them overcome these 
circumstances, to improve intelligence sharing and the control of 
money flows. But it must not press to a point that undermines these 
governments for, in the short term, any foreseeable alternative 
would be worse for our interests and for the peoples involved.

Yet there are limits beyond which a serious policy cannot go. There 
is no reason for treating as members of the coalition countries 
whose state-supported media advocate and justify terrorism, 
withhold intelligence vital to the security of potential victims 
and permit terrorist groups to operate from their territory.

These considerations apply especially to Iran. Geopolitics argues 
for improved U.S.-Iranian relations. To welcome Iran into an anti-
terrorism coalition has as a prerequisite the abandonment of its 
current role as the leading supporter of global terrorism, as both 
the State Department and the bipartisan Bremer Commission have 
reported. An Iranian relationship with the West can prosper only 
when both sides feel the need for it. Both sides - and not only the 
West - must make fundamental choices. The same is true to a 
somewhat lesser degree of Syria.

The war on terrorism is not just about hunting down terrorists. It, 
above all, is to protect the extraordinary opportunity that has 
come about to recast the international system. The North Atlantic 
nations, having understood their common dangers, can turn to a new 
definition of common purposes. Relations with former adversaries 
can go beyond liquidating the vestiges of the cold war and find a 
new role for Russia in its post-imperial phase, and for China as it 
emerges into great power status.

India is emerging as an important global player. After measurable 
success in the anti-terrorism campaign, when it does not appear as 
concession to the terrorists, the Middle East peace process should 
be urgently resumed. These and other prospects must not be allowed 
to vanish because those that have the ability to prevail shrink 
from what their opportunities require. -Los Angeles Times Syndicate

<a name="mist">Mistrust in the West</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohsin Hamid

It may be hard, with bearded rioters filling their televisions, for 
westerners to see Pakistan as a bride left at the altar. But that 
is how many Pakistanis view their relationship with the fickle 
West, and they have good reason to do so.

In the 1980s, when Pakistan signed up as America's ally in the 
West's last war in Afghanistan, the war against the Soviets, 
Pakistan was rewarded with billions of dollars of military hardware 
and economic aid. But Pakistan paid a price: heroin flooded our 
cities, Kalashnikovs became common on our streets and young boys 
were left trained for jihad instead of university.

When the Soviets were defeated, Pakistan did not share in the long-
awaited peace dividend. Although the country was making its 
transition from dictatorship to democracy, aid began to dwindle and 
the rhetoric of western governments became increasingly unfriendly. 
Pakistan was left with training camps for religious guerrillas, a 
mountain of debt, two million Afghan refugees and little else.

Certainly, Pakistan's own leaders bear much of the blame. Corrupt, 
ineffectual and often deeply hypocritical, the governments of 
Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif tried to go forward and backward at 
once, burnishing their religious credentials while hoping to 
attract western investors. But, at the same time, the West did 
recoil from us with unseemly haste once its war was won. It began 
treating Pakistan like an impoverished Muslim nation with no oil to 
export. But Pakistan had been this all along. To ignore a girl's 
hairy moles the night before, when one's need is strong, and then 
to shame her for them in the morning, well, as the Texans say, 
that's not real nice.

It is not surprising that most Pakistanis do not support America's 
bombardment of Afghanistan. The Afghans are neighbours on the brink 
of starvation and devastated by war. America has shown itself to be 
untrustworthy, a superpower that uses its values as a scabbard for 
its sword. Avenging the horrible deaths of thousands by putting 
millions more at risk is an act deeply lacking in compassion, and 
one unlikely to reduce the hatred that makes America unsafe.

Yet, forced to decide whether to back their government in a 
showdown with our own religious extremists, most Pakistanis are 
clear about the future they desire. They do not want a medieval 
theocracy. They want jobs and access to the markets and knowledge 
and entertainment of the wider world.

What many in the West do not realize is that Pakistan is a land 
where satellite dishes are not uncommon, where teenagers who have 
never been to America manage to smuggle in bits and pieces of 
American accents. In the decade of democracy that lasted through 
the '90s, religious parties never captured more than a few per cent 
of the vote. But when the economy is stagnant, democracy has 
sputtered out and growing numbers of young people find themselves 
ill-equipped for a workforce that they in any case lack the right 
connections to enter, then the appeal of an Islamist ideology that 
challenges these injustices grows strong.

Pakistan is making a dangerous gamble by confronting its religious 
right. The country is betting that it will not be torn in two, that 
its leader will not be assassinated, that it will not be plunged 
into anarchy.

Now that it has taken this risk, the country needs the West to 
stand firm beside it. Not by providing weaponry. Not even by 
rescheduling debt, though that, of course, will help. What Pakistan 
mainly needs is the openness that comes when fear recedes, but 
Pakistan needs that openness now, when the West is still fearful. 
Pakistanis need jobs. We need access to purchasers for our goods, 
investors in our industries. With these things come greater growth 
and stability, which then become self-reinforcing.

Pakistan needs a partnership to start this process, a coming 
together for the long term. Without it, the three million people 
who swell our population each year will sink deeper into poverty, 
and the ideologies that appeal to memories of a better past will 
gain appeal.

<a name="aflo">Afloat (barely) on a sea of shame</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

Across the globe, and now hesitantly even in the United States, 
doubts are rising about the morality and sense of America's war on 
Afghanistan. Yet Pakistan's military government is living in a 
world of its own. Having committed the country to a course whose 
only virtue was expediency, it is trying to convince itself and the 
nation that signing up for a leading role in an enterprise detested 
throughout the Muslim world has been the best thing Pakistan ever 
did.

No other country in the world has offered its services so readily, 
or as completely, to the US as Pakistan. Even America's closest 
allies like Egypt and Saudi Arabia have withheld the kind of 
support expected of them. We are alone in this - with only that 
other great democracy, Uzbekistan, for company.

Is this a war against terror? Had this been so it should have begun 
from the Palestinian occupied territories where for 50 years Israel 
has been practising the worst kind of terror with the full support 
and understanding of the United States. Stripped of the self-
righteous rhetoric which covers it, this is a war of blind 
vengeance but one which is already going astray because of the 
commanding fallacy on which it was based: that unable to withstand 
the knockout effect of air power, the Taliban would collapse in a 
matter of days.

To the growing discomfiture of the US and Pakistan this is not 
happening. With little on their side except spirit and 
determination, the Taliban are absorbing punishment but not giving 
up. The concern is beginning to show on American faces. Some 
reluctant admissions have also been made about the doggedness of 
Taliban resistance. As for Pakistan, the opinion expressed 
initially by its chief strategist, General Musharraf, that the days 
of the Taliban were numbered, may yet come to haunt him.

Why did we hasten to assume the role of bag-carrier? The argument 
advanced, almost as if it was self-evident, that we had little 
choice and that it was a question of choosing between national 
survival and national destruction is patently false. How was our 
national survival on the line? It took the US nearly three weeks of 
preparation before launching air strikes on Afghanistan. We 
succumbed and offered everything the Americans were demanding after 
a few angry statements from Bush and a mere phone call from Colin 
Powell, a day or two after September 11.

If we had asked for time to weigh the pros and cons and to consult 
friends would that have meant inviting US anger and getting our 
nuclear facilities flattened? Prudence and caution are good things 
but capitulation has a different ring to it.

Surely a strange nation which in so many things has pursued self-
defeating policies and closed its eyes to real dangers but which 
succumbs at the first threat of an imaginary danger. The name given 
to this vacillation of spirit is "national interest" (without the 
definite article, please note) - "national interest" being the new 
name for short-sighted expediency in Pakistan.

What crimes in our history have been committed at the altar of the 
national interest, what follies not consecrated in its name. But 
what Pakistan is now doing takes the prize. In helping the US carry 
out its strikes on Afghanistan, our hands are also now covered in 
Afghan and Muslim blood. Why blame the Americans alone? We are 
accessories before and after the fact. No amount of references to 
the national interest will wash these stains away in a hurry.

The oft-repeated charge that we helped create the Taliban is 
disproved by this very fact. A nation as weak in spirit as ours 
could never have created a force with the resolve and fortitude of 
the Taliban. The Taliban are a product of the lawlessness which 
engulfed Afghanistan after the fall of Najibullah. We merely helped 
them along. Our government could not withstand the threat implicit 
in a phone call. How can we lay claim to a movement defying the 
fury of the mightiest military force in the world?

To be sure, inviting destruction is no sign of wisdom. So it is 
possible to fault the Taliban for their foolhardiness. But this is 
not the whole truth. Even in the US it is now being admitted that 
in various ways the Taliban had signaled their readiness to be 
flexible on the question of Osama bin Laden. The Americans were 
just too angry, or too arrogant, to read those signals or give them 
the importance they deserved. The Taliban were left with no option. 
They could either have let their noses be rubbed in the dust, which 
is what accepting American demands would have amounted to, or stood 
up to American threats.

That they chose the honourable course, if also the more difficult 
one, is a tribute to their spirit. Far from demoralizing them, 
American bombing has only strengthened their resolve while we have 
been left to cite the Treaty of Hudaybia - in which the Prophet, on 
whom be peace, made peace with the infidels of Makkah.

Whenever a Muslim ruler embarks upon the path of compromise he 
remembers nothing else from the entire pantheon of Islam except the 
Treaty of Hudaybia. That treaty gave the Prophet a respite during 
which he was able to gather his strength before setting out for the 
final conquest of Makkah. For which conquest of Makkah is the 
Musharraf government conserving Pakistan's strength?

While the government congratulates itself for the fictional 
advantages of selling the country to the US, it is oblivious to the 
real dangers whose seeds are being scattered across Pakistan's 
soil. What amount of aid can compensate Pakistan for the hordes of 
helpless Afghan refugees being driven across its borders? What can 
make up for the fissures opening up within Pakistan as a result of 
the Afghan war? The government is isolated but secure because it 
has the army behind it. The majority of Pakistanis are unhappy with 
their government but helpless to change its direction. This is a 
recipe for frustration and anger. And a dangerous erosion of 
national self-confidence.

For the first time in Pakistan's history the religious parties are 
reflecting public opinion while the so-called mainstream parties 
are content to waddle in the government's shadow, dutifully 
chanting the mantra that Pakistan had no choice but to side with 
the United States. The bankruptcy of Pakistani politics is thus 
complete, with the only two relevant factors being the government 
and the religious parties. The PPP and the various rumps of the 
Muslim League still command the popular vote but no longer command 
popular passion or anger.

Which Churchill will say this was Pakistan's finest hour? But while 
on the subject, let another delusion be nailed to the mast. A lot 
of Pakistanis - including, to my lasting shame, myself - took it 
for granted that the Taliban were exerting a reactionary influence 
on Pakistan. From this premise it was a small step to the 
conclusion that it was right to leave the Taliban in the lurch, and 
perhaps to their fate, as it served them right and this was also in 
Pakistan's best interests. Blind prejudice is no aid to clarity. 
Although there was a cross-border effect of Taliban rule on the two 
border provinces of the Frontier and Balochistan, the Taliban were 
not exporting their austere revolution to us. It is we who were 
imposing our patronage on them in the pursuit of such chimeras as 
strategic depth.

Our problems are our own and not because of the Taliban. The 
corruption and lack of direction which characterize our national 
life are not faults we can lay at somebody else's door. If the 
Taliban had not existed we would still have been lost in the woods, 
the ISI would still have meddled in politics. Now that we are rid 
of supporting the Taliban the walls of which shining kingdom will 
we raise in Pakistan?

In Iqbal's philosophy the bedrock of individual assertion and 
collective greatness is self-respect (a loose translation of his 
central concept of 'khudi'). With that lost, what is a nation left 
with? We have entered into a Faustian pact with the United States, 
handing over not just our air bases for use against the helpless 
people of Afghanistan but also the tattered remnants of our 
national pride. What can we possibly get in return for this?

<a name="cant">Can the lemmings be wrong?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

A T-shirt that surfaced briefly in Oxford in the sixties 
proclaimed: "100,000 Lemmings Can't Be Wrong." Perhaps some 
enterprising manufacturer could resurrect it for all those 
supporting the Taliban and Osama bin Laden.

Another image that comes to mind is the Pied Piper whose magic 
flute bewitched the children of Hamelin into following him wherever 
he led. But while the mental age of those crazed zealots who 
currently populate CNN and BBC newscasts is probably the same as 
the kids from the fairy tale, what excuse do educated and 
apparently sane people have? Recently, I wrote about the weird 
fantasy world so many Muslims have decided to live in, and no doubt 
will be forced to do so again.

I am frequently exasperated by the refusal of even highly 
intelligent, cosmopolitan, widely travelled friends to face up to 
reality. Since we seem unable to talk about any topic other than 
Afghanistan, I am often the only one trying to keep the discussion 
focused on facts while the others dart off on the scent of some mad 
theory or other. The other day somebody voiced grave suspicion 
about the current rise of the rupee against the dollar: surely this 
was the work of some cabal trying to hurt our exports. I pointed 
out that perhaps it was simply due to the forces of supply and 
demand: since many of our debts are being rescheduled, the demand 
for the dollar has fallen. Another plausible explanation is that 
Pakistanis who had stashed their dollars abroad were afraid their 
accounts would be questioned as part of the on-going scrutiny of 
dubious holdings, specially in the Gulf, and had therefore 
transferred their greenbacks to Pakistan.

Irrespective of the nature of the rumour, you can be sure it will 
immediately be believed by the credulous; my problem is that I had 
no idea there were so many of them out there. One reader sent me an 
e-mail demanding that I should only write against the Americans and 
the Jews, even if I had to lie. I told him I was not in the habit 
of lying in my columns. Furious, he called me a "fool", insisting 
it was the duty of all Muslims to fight America. One friend is sure 
the Americans are here because they want a base in Pakistan to 
"control China", just as they set up a base in Saudi Arabia after 
the Gulf War. I pointed out that the Saudis had asked for American 
military presence, and this was unlikely to happen here. Indeed, 
the Americans had bases in Japan and South Korea to "control China" 
if that is what they wanted to do.

Clearly, there is some deeper phenomenon at work here. The 
suspicion and anger that surround American actions in the Muslim 
world cannot be explained by recent events alone: it would seem 
that some profoundly atavistic feelings have been conjured up. Much 
has been written and said about the sense of impotence and 
powerlessness we Muslims are supposed to feel when faced with the 
power and wealth of the United States which flaunts its supremacy 
clumsily and arrogantly. Many Americans are convinced that we envy 
them their affluence and freedom. Other commentators ascribe the 
rage to the open-ended American support for the daily Israeli 
cruelties against Palestinians and the occupation of their lands, 
as well as the on-going humiliation of Iraq and the unnecessary 
deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children as a result of 
sanctions.

I suspect that underlying these reasons, the community of Islam has 
a shared memory of the Crusades and the subsequent struggle for 
power between Islam and Christendom - a struggle the former lost 
when the balance of power shifted westward because Muslims refused 
to accept and internalize the new sciences that were transforming 
economies and armies alike. Indeed, for centuries before the 
crusades, the Persians had fought first the Greeks and then the 
Romans for supremacy over the known world. So perhaps the current 
"war against terrorism" should be seen as the latest chapter in the 
millennia-old war between East and West.

But ancient power struggles do not suddenly move men to kill 
themselves and thousands of others as happened in America on 
September 11. For more immediate answers, perhaps we need to look 
in the festering Palestinian refugee camps and their beleaguered 
and impoverished cities in the West Bank, slums from Cairo to 
Karachi, the hospitals of Baghdad that are without medicines, and 
the black hole that Afghanistan has become. Apart from providing 
foot soldiers for the jihad, they also generate the rage that 
radicalizes young Muslims everywhere. The fact that hundreds of 
Britons of Pakistani origin are fighting with the Taliban is a sign 
of things to come in the West.

But while the motivation of these committed people is clear, one is 
puzzled by the reaction of highly educated and sophisticated 
Pakistanis to recent events. For years, they had been complaining 
about the rise in religiosity and the decline of the economy. 
However, the tragedy that befell the United States on September 11 
set into motion a fortuitous chain of events for Pakistan that 
might halt the advance of religious extremism and boost our 
stagnant economy. But instead of welcoming the positive aspects of 
these developments, they sit in their air-conditioned living rooms, 
muttering darkly about the conspiracies out there and criticising 
the bombing of Afghanistan.

In fact, recent events have posed a real dilemma for the liberal-
left all over the world; instinctively, they are against the 
Americans bombing a country already devastated by years of warfare 
and drought. But opposing military action puts them very close to 
the Taliban, a group they abhor. Clearly, no sensible person wants 
to see the battered and brutalized Afghan population suffer any 
more, but how are they to be rid of their repressive self-appointed 
leaders except through foreign intervention?

The same Pakistani critics question General Musharraf's decision to 
join the American-led coalition and give Washington various 
facilities, including the use of specified airfields. According to 
one view, we jumped on the American bandwagon with undignified 
haste. But if a neighbour has suffered a major bereavement and 
comes for help, you don't negotiate the extent of your assistance 
on the doorstep. Others maintain that while we might have allowed 
Americans the use of our airspace, we shouldn't have given them 
access to our airfields. This is not unlike somebody wanting to 
retain part of his or her virginity.

These people are all for the debt rescheduling (and possible write-
offs), the lifting of tariffs and quotas on our exports and the sea 
of respectability conferred by the international community, but 
want to oppose the American action in Afghanistan. In short, they 
want their cake and eat it too. Welcome to the real world where 
there is no such thing as a free lunch.

Perhaps they would like to wear the T-shirt that says "100,000 
Lemmings Can't Be Wrong."

<a name="nave">Naved shows class with 113</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rehan Siddiqui

SHARJAH, Nov 2: Pakistan, known to be bad chasers, proved everyone 
wrong by overhauling Sri Lanka's stiff 272 comfortably to earn a 
morale-boosting win by seven wickets in the dress rehearsal for 
Sunday's final of the Khaleej Times Trophy at the Sharjah Stadium.

And the men who made the task look so simple were rookie opener 
Naved Latif, playing his second one-dayer and the cool as cucumber 
customer, big man Inzamam-ul-Haq. The youngster was later named 
Man-of-the-Match.

Both hammered centuries in their massive third wicket stand of 219 
after Pakistan had lost Shahid Afridi (11) and Yousuf Youhana (11) 
with the total 41. Naved reached his maiden hundred off 130 balls 
with eight fours and a six while Inzamam needed only 111 deliveries 
and hit 10 fours.

When Naved eventually holed out to Prabath Nissanka on the deep 
mid-wicket boundary Pakistan required only 12 runs for an emphatic 
victory. He faced 141 deliveries for his 113 that contained nine 
fours and one six.

Inzamam, during his innings, became the highest scorer at this 
venue overtaking his teammate Saeed Anwar while ending up with an 
unbeaten 118. He slammed two sixes and ten fours.

Sri Lanka sorely Muttiah Muralitharan their prime strike bowler. He 
might have made some difference and the islanders also had a poor 
match in the field. They put down three simple sitters which proved 
expensive in the end.

Inzamam was dropped by Muralitharan when 69 and Naved was missed 
twice once by Russel Arnold off his own bowling and wicketkeeper 
Kumar Sangakkara, who had replaced Romesh Kaluwitharana, missed an 
easy catch behind the stumps.

Earlier, Mahela Jayawardena's elegant 88 off 83 balls that 
contained one six and six fours provided Sri Lankan the big enough 
total Sanath Jayasuriya won the toss and elected to bat first in a 
match of no consequence.

Given a solid start of 95 by Jayasuriya (36) and Avishka 
Gunawardena (57), the classy Jayawardena - certainly the best Sri 
Lankan batsman - carted Pakistan's wayward attack to all corners of 
the ground with a series of exciting strokes.

Jayawardena shared two profitable partnerships. First he was 
involved in a stand worth 55 for the third wicket with Gunawardena 
and latter 66 for the fourth with in alliance with Russel Arnold.

He was eventually got out going for a big hit in the closing overs 
off Shoaib Akhtar, the best of Pakistan's modest attack minus Wasim 
Akram, who was given a rest. The controversial pacer finished with 
the figures of three for 45 from 10 overs.

<a name="ruth">Ruthless Pakistan thrash winless Zimbabwe</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rehan Siddiqui

SHARJAH, Oct 28: Zimbabwe's losing streak became 'unlucky' 13 as 
they predictably lost to Pakistan by a wide margin of 106 by runs 
in the Khaleej Times Trophy Sunday at the Sharjah Stadium.

The defeat virtually condemned Zimbabwe out of Sunday's final. 

They will have to win their last two matches by massive margins, a 
big ask from a side which has neither bowling nor batting resources 
to achieve that impossible task.

A victory for Zimbabwe was never on cards after the African nation 
allowed Pakistan to an almost unbeatable total of 279 considering 
their batting limitations.

As it happened Zimbabwe were bowled out for 173 in 39.1 overs with 
only Andy Flower (51) and Stuart Carlisle showing resistance 
against a Pakistan attack that was nothing more than modest.

The early loss of the openers, Doug Marillier and Grant Flower, 
with just five runs on the board pushed Zimbabwe on the back foot. 

Though the third wicket stand between Andy Flower and Carlisle 
raised hopes of a fight back but once the pair were separated by a 
needless run out of the latter it was all over bar shouting.

**From 112 for three Zimbabwe plunged to nine for 146 with spinners 
Shoaib Malik and Shahid Afridi - later named Man-of-the-Match - 
shared five wickets as Zimbabwe middle order caved in without 
fight.

Pakistan should have wrapped up the match much earlier if Abdur 
Razzaq had not dropped a regulation catch offered by Heath Streak 
and Rashid Latif missed a regulation stumping to remove Travis 
Friend.

Earlier, taking optimum advantage of a mediocre Zimbabwe attack 
Pakistan batsmen found some sort of form to post a healthy looking 
279 for six after Waqar Younis again won the toss and decided to 
bat first.

A sparse crowd, not more than a few hundred, saw Shahid Afridi (67) 
and Saeed Anwar (64) put on 91 for the second wicket to lay the 
foundation of a huge total.

Shahid and Saeed having failed against Sri Lanka batted with 
confidence specially the former who clubbed five sixes and three 
fours in his 81-ball innings. 

Saeed, who was more sedate, was bowled going for a big hit. He also 
hit a six and six fours and faced 80 deliveries. However, the real 
fireworks were provided by Abdur Razzaq and Wasim Akram in the slog 
overs. 

Razzaq appeared on his way to getting the fastest 50 but was run 
out by a direct throw from Zimbabwe skipper Brian Murphy. Razzaq 
had earlier struck the biggest six of the tournament, sending the 
ball soaring out of the ground and into the adjoining football 
field. His 46-ball gem contained two sixes and two fours.

Later Wasim, the former captain, struck out lustily in the final 
two overs to score a rapid unbeaten 22 off only 14 balls that 
contained two sixes and a one four.

<a name="sril">Sri Lanka beat Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

SHARJAH, Oct 27: It was a mismatch with Pakistan well and truly 
whipped by a professional Sri Lankan team in a totally one-sided 
affair by seven wickets in the Khaleej Times Trophy at the Sharjah 
Stadium.

A total of 176 to overhaul on a placid wicket was never going to be 
testing one barring a sensational collapse which never materialized 
as Pakistan's over-rated attack except Wasim Akram posed few 
problems to the Sri Lankan batsmen.

The only bright spots for Pakistan in the field was Wasim Akram who 
bowled his heart out but was desperately unlucky not to be amongst 
wickets. While the bowling lacked penetration the buttered fingered 
fielders also compounded the problems. Sanath Jayasuriya was 
dropped by Shoaib Malik in Waqar Younis' third over.

Aviskha Gunawardena, who enjoyed a charmed life especially during 
Wasim Akram's opening burst, too was put down by Saeed Anwar in the 
60s. Later named Man-of-the-Match, Gunawardena was eventually 
dismissed for 88. He slammed 13 fours and faced 122 balls.

Pakistan on this performance will have to improve beyond 
recognition to even beat the current 'whipping boys' Zimbabwe 
tomorrow to make next Sunday's final.

<a name="nofe">No fear of being sacked, says Hanif</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shazad Ali

KARACHI, Oct 28: Hanif Khan, said he has no fear of being sacked if 
the team fails to deliver in next month's Champions Trophy since he 
has not received an ultimatum from the game's administrators.

"I am the national coach. I suppose I will continue to train the 
boys even if the team does not fare well in the Champions Trophy. I 
have no plans to step down even after team's defeat.

"Nobody from the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) ever talked to me 
and never said I will be replaced or removed if the team faltered," 
Hanif disclosed from Lahore before leaving for Rotterdam with the 
national squad.

Hanif's statement was a startling disclosure given the fact 
president of the PHF, Gen Aziz Khan, on Sept 22, gave the team 
management last opportunity to produce results or be ready to face 
the music.

The PHF president had said team officials would be sacked and 
replaced by another set of management to raise a formidable outfit 
for next February's World Cup in Kuala Lumpur.

The team officials are under fire since Pakistan's dismal 
performance at the Azlan Shah Cup in Kuala Lumpur last August where 
the team secured fourth position. The showing at the Cup was the 
worst ever in the history of the tournament.

"Had there been plans to remove me, the PHF could have done it a 
long time ago. I will be carrying no burden or apprehension during 
the Trophy. I have always served my country as player and a coach, 
not for anybody else," Hanif said.

The former left-inner said he would like to carry on at least till 
the World Cup next year like the way the PHF had planned earlier. 
The PHF, appointing the team officials early this year had 
categorically said the officials would be at the helm at least 
until the World Cup.

KARACHI, Nov 1: Jahangir Khan said he was not satisfied with the 
Pakistan team's showing at the World Team Championship as the 
overall standard displayed during the tourney was not very high.

"I am not at all satisfied with the 11th position finish simply 
because the overall standard of the Championship was not very 
high," Jahangir, winner of a record ten British Open titles, told 
SADA.

Pakistan, six-time winner of the World Team title, finished an 
abysmal 11th in the Championship, failing to qualify for the 
quarterfinals.

"Considering the efforts put in by the Pakistan Squash Federation 
the result is not encouraging and the players showed a lack of 
confidence and of proper coaching," he said. "The PSF has never 
held so many camps for a team in the past but I think the choice of 
coach was not correct and our team failed to live up to 
expectations."

The Pakistan team was coached by former British Open Amateur 
champion Aftab Javed.-SADA

ISLAMABAD, Oct 31: Pakistan have been allotted the 2005 World Men's 
Team Squash Championship while they have also offered to host the 
World Junior tournament in 2004 in case Colombia are unable to do 
so because of security reasons.

A press release of the Pakistan Squash Federation said that the 
decisions were taken at the 31st Annual General Meeting of the 
World Squash Federation in Melbourne recently.

The AGM was attended by Air Marshal Syed Qaiser Hussain, Senior 
Vice President of the PSF along with Jahangir Khan who is a vice 
president of both the WSF and the Pakistan federation.

In the meeting, reservations were expressed by some members about 
security in Colombia for the World Junior Championship. In this 
backdrop Pakistan filed a back-up bid to stage the competition.

Security for the forthcoming World Open in India was also 
discussed. The representative of the Squash Rackets Federation of 
India assured the house that the participants would be provided 
tight security. He also said that players would be assisted in 
acquiring visas to ensure their participation in the tournament.

<a name="paym">Payments to seven cricketers stopped</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 30: Coca Cola have stopped payments to seven Pakistan 
cricketers for their failure to respond to the letters of 
confirmation, sources said.

Seven Pakistan players - Moin Khan, Waqar Younis, Inzamam-ul-Haq, 
Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmad, Yousuf Youhana and Saeed Anwar - 
had signed lucrative deals with Coca Cola for appearing in the 
company's promotional campaign, through their agent, Sports 
Unlimited. But at least five of them - Waqar, Inzamam, Yousuf, 
Saqlain and Saeed - may face legal action as they have decided to 
revoke their contracts with Coca Cola.

Sources at the cricket headquarters at Gaddafi Stadium claimed the 
players have sent their requests for termination of contracts. But 
Sports Limited argued that they have yet to receive any appeal.

The players have been forced to revoke their contracts by the 
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) who are the aggrieved party in the 
entire scenario as their agreement with Pepsi as team sponsor was 
being affected. Pepsi pays $4.6million for using its logo on the 
players' kits.

Knowledgeable sources said Coca Cola had paid the players four 
installments of their contracts. But the fifth installment with a 
bonus has now been put on hold. "Letters of confirmation were 
written to the players who have failed to respond. Until the 
players acknowledge, they will not be paid the fifth installment," 
sources said.

The fifth installment was due to be paid on Oct 3.

Moin Khan had signed the contract for Rs2.2million, Waqar for 
Rs1.3million, Inzamam Rs1.75million, Saeed Rs1.45million, Saqlain 
Rs1.25million, Mushtaq Rs800,000 and Youhana Rs900,000.

The next year's contract was to be revised with an annual raise of 
10 per cent to 20 per cent (depending upon the performance during 
2001) over 2001.

The first installment of 10 per cent of the annual amount was paid 
on Jan 15 while the second installment of 15 per cent of the amount 
was paid on Feb 10. The third and fourth installments (25 per cent 
each) were paid to the players on April 3 and July 3 respectively.

In the fifth installment, Moin was to get Rs1.1million, Waqar 
Rs650,000, Inzamam Rs875,000, Saeed Rs723,000, Saqlain Rs615,000, 
Youhana Rs450,000 and Mushtaq Rs400,000.

"In the letters, the players have been asked to confirm their 
availability for shooting of some commercials and other advertising 
drills. But unfortunately, the players haven't responded which left 
Coca Cola no other option than to temporarily stop their payments 
and adopt the wait-and-see policy," sources said.

A spokesman of the Sports Unlimited said the decision about legal 
action would be taken by the regional office in Bahrain. "When 
Sports Unlimited get players' request, they would contact Coca 
Cola's country office who will then forward the request to Bahrain.

"If Bahrain decides to take legal action against Sports Unlimited, 
Sports Unlimited, in turn, will press charges against the players. 
It should not be forgotten that Sports Unlimited had signed with 
Coca Cola on players' behalf."

In the four instalments until Oct 3, Coca Cola has paid Rs2,096,000 
to the seven players.

<a name="cric">Pakistan cricket stars in legal trap</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Oct 29: At least six current Pakistan cricketers may end 
up in a court of law after they were forced to terminate their 
lucrative two-year contracts by the cricket board.

Highly placed sources said captain Waqar Younis, vice-captain 
Inzamam-ul-Haq, Saeed Anwar, Yousuf Youhana and Azhar Mahmood had 
filed requests to their agent - Sports Unlimited - for termination 
of the contracts before leaving for Sharjah.

Three other players - Moin Khan, Mushtaq Ahmad and Saqlain Mushtaq 
- also had signed contracts with Sports Unlimited. But Saqlain is 
not representing the country because of his personal commitments 
whereas Moin and Mushtaq have not been asked to terminate their 
bond as they are currently not in the selectors' reckoning.

According to a copy of the agreement, obtained by Dawn, "the 
players confirm to provide The Coca Cola Export Corporation (TCCEC) 
with the services of product celebrity for a period of two years 
commencing Jan 1, 2001." The agreement is to run from Jan 1, 2001 
to Dec 31, 2002.

Inzamam has signed the contract at Rs1.7million, Waqar 
Rs1.3million, Youhana Rs900,000, Saeed Rs1.4million and Moin 
Rs2.4million. However, the players are being pressurised to revoke 
their contracts as it directly clashes with the interests of the 
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) who have an agreement with Coca Cola's 
arch rival Pepsi which annually pays $4.6million to the PCB.

While a spokesman of Sports Unlimited denied that he had received 
the plea of cancellation of contracts, he admitted that he wouldn't 
be surprised if the players came up with the request.

"I wouldn't be surprised at all because I know they are under 
immense pressure to terminate their contracts. It's because of that 
pressure that they have not been following dates for product's 
publicity campaigns," Rafi Hasan, chief executive of Sports 
Unlimited, said. He added that this year, the players had appeared 
just once in commercial and had since then been dodging him as well 
as the sponsors.

But Rafi said that he would take the players to the court of law if 
Coca Cola decided to take legal action against him. "If Coca Cola 
takes me to the court, naturally I would press charges against the 
players. The simple reason is that I have not violated any contract 
but it's the players who are backing out."

He, however, emphasized that he would not initiate any charges 
against the players until forced to. The spokesman further said the 
players can only request for termination of the contracts but 
cannot revoke it. "If they decide to revoke it, they might face 
severe embarrassment," he said.

Explaining his role and involvement in the entire scenario, he 
cited the example of Azhar Mahmood who returned the contract along 
with the initial amount to Coca Cola. "But it was not entertained 
because the players have a contract with Sports Unlimited and not 
with Coca Cola. It's me who has signed the contract with Coca Cola 
on players' behalf. This implies that Azhar is legally contracted 
with me no matter what he thinks," he said.

While the PCB have promised to compensate the players with either a 
fresh contract or sign them with some other sponsor, rumours at the 
Gaddafi Stadium are that the PCB were also contemplating 
compensating Sports Unlimited by awarding stadia rights for three 
years at Rs50million.

But Rafi Hasan dispelled the impression, saying: "We had bought 
cricket and hockey stadia rights for the cancelled events. We had, 
in fact, proposed the PCB to award us the contracts on a longer 
terms, say three years at Rs50million. "But it was our proposal and 
nothing more than that."

Legal experts said the hands of the players were completed tied 
after signing the contract. "They cannot escape from the contract. 
It's a one-sided contract in which there is no termination clause. 
In fact, according to the contract, the players cannot appear for 
Coca Cola's rivals for six months after the termination of the 
contract," legal experts said.

Clause 5 of the contract, a copy of which is with Dawn, says:

"I (player) agree that during the term of this agreement and for a
