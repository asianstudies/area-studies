<a name="mush">Musharraf rules out falling of N-assets into wrong hands</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 21: President Gen Pervez Musharraf has ruled out any 
likelihood of the country's nuclear and missile assets falling into 
wrong hands, saying that "they are absolutely secure under 
custodial safeguards."

In an interview with the Far Eastern Economic Review, he said, "I 
can say they (the nuclear and missile assets) are absolutely 
secure. We have no doubt."

Asked if the country's nuclear weapons and technology was secure, 
the president said he had no doubt about that. "We have 
institutionalized arrangements. We have a national command 
authority, which oversees everything. There are custodial 
safeguards."

Gen Musharraf said the arrangements made were totally secure and 
"I'm very sure that there cannot be any proliferation, there cannot 
be any breach of security, our nuclear and missile assets cannot 
fall into wrong hands at all."

With regard to the two nuclear scientists, who have been detained 
for violating security rules, he stated that action against them 
would be taken if it was confirmed that they had violated the 
security rules.

Answering a question about an Indian newspaper report that the 
nuclear scientists may have fled to Burma, the president said: 
"India just wants one thing; they want to damage us. Anything they 
want to do in Afghanistan, the purpose is only one; how to do 
something, which will be against Pakistan that will damage our 
cause. That is their sole purpose."

Afghanistan, he said, had suffered tremendously and "we understand 
their problems. We are their neighbours. Geography, our common 
history, our common culture and religion cannot be undermined by 
any actions of India, I'm very sure of that."

Replying to another question, he said, "We have to make sure that 
the political environment that will emerge in Afghanistan is such 
which brings peace and stability and ensures the unity of 
Afghanistan and is representative of all ethnic groups. And which 
is friendly with all its neighbours, which includes Pakistan."

Gen Musharraf said his country wanted to have a negotiated 
settlement of the Kashmir dispute.

Answering another question, he dispelled the impression of any 
government sponsorship in what was happening in the occupied 
Kashmir Valley.

The president asked how the freedom struggles in the held Kashmir 
could have continued if it was not indigenous and did not have the 
backing of the people of Kashmir. "Why doesn't India open the 
border and let international groups like Amnesty International to 
come and see?"

When asked whether a pipeline from Iran to India passing through 
Pakistan could act as a confidence building measure with India, he 
said, "Absolutely. We're for it." He added that it was India that 
did not want it because of its own suspicion.

Replying to a question, he said the government was determined to 
hold the general election in October next year. The election 
commission, he added, would be absolutely autonomous and that 
provincial elections would also be held in the same month.

He did not see any role for Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif in the 
election. "Their parties will have a role. It will be a party-based 
election. The People's Party and the Pakistan Muslim League are two 
of the important parties and we wish them well."-APP

<a name="gove">Government says it will not retaliate </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 21: In a clear depart from the traditional tit-for-
tat response, Pakistan decided not to recall its High Commissioner 
from New Delhi as done by India.

"The Government of Pakistan regrets the decision of the Government 
of India to withdraw its High Commissioner from Islamabad. Pakistan 
does not intend to respond in kind," said a statement issued by the 
Foreign Office. "Indeed the Government of Pakistan feels that in 
the prevailing tense situation it is all the more important to keep 
all channels of communications open," it said.

The Foreign Office also regretted the Indian decision to terminate 
the rail and bus services with Pakistan. This step would only serve 
to create hardships for common people desirous of travelling 
between the two countries.

The Foreign Office rejected the Indian allegation of continued 
promotion of cross-border terrorism by Pakistan.

It reminded India that Pakistan had asked for credible evidence 
about involvement of Pakistan-based groups and individuals for 
investigation and appropriate action by the government.

Pakistan, it maintained, had also offered to participate in a joint 
inquiry with India to ascertain true motives and identities of 
perpetrators of the terrorist incident. "Regrettably the Indian 
government has consistently declined these proposals," it noted.

Pakistan would preserve its policy of restraint and would continue 
to work for the lowering of tensions with India, it added.

In a separate statement, a Foreign Office spokesman expressed 
serious concern over reports of massive troop movements by India 
along the Pakistan-India border in the Sindh-Rajasthan sector as 
well as in the Chenab-Ravi corridor and along the LoC in Kashmir.

The spokesman said that the Indian troop movements, which followed 
provocative and threatening statements by Indian leadership, would 
aggravate an already tense situation in the region. Naturally 
Pakistan would be obliged to take all appropriate counter measures, 
he added.

Earlier, the spokesman disclosed that Pakistan Deputy High 
Commissioner in New Delhi was summoned to the Indian Ministry of 
External Affairs and informed that according to Indian agencies all 
the five terrorists involved in the attack on the Indian Parliament 
on Dec 13 were Pakistan nationals.

A request was accordingly made to the Government of Pakistan to 
receive the bodies for burial in Pakistan, it said.

The Indian side was told that considering the inherently biased 
attitude of Indian agencies any unilateral determination regarding 
the identity of these individuals was unacceptable to Pakistan, it 
added.

The Indian government, it maintained, was once again asked to 
provide credible evidence about any involvement of Pakistan-based 
groups and individuals for investigation and appropriate action by 
the government of Pakistan.

Pakistan has also offered to participate in a joint inquiry with 
India to unmask the motives and real identities of the perpetrators 
of the terrorist incident. Regrettably, the Indian government had 
turned down this reasonable proposal, it said.

The Deputy High Commissioner urged the Indian government to 
reconsider Pakistan's proposal for an impartial inquiry into the 
incident and resist the temptation to use this reprehensible 
incident to placate domestic lobbies, it added.

<a name="indi">India will not attack, US assures Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 21: The government has been assured by the United 
States that India will not attack Pakistan as is largely being 
apprehended these days.

Official sources said that President Gen Pervez Musharraf and 
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar had been assured by US Secretary of 
State Colin Powel on telephone two days ago that India would not 
attack Pakistan nor would it cross the Line of Control (LoC) in 
Kashmir.

The sources said that Pakistan was fully cooperating with the US-
led military coalition to hunt down terrorists in Afghanistan and 
under these circumstances the Bush Administration did not want any 
problem for Gen Pervez Musharraf.

The sources said that Pakistan side comprehensively briefed the US 
Secretary of State about the Indian leadership's recent statements 
of following a policy of hot pursuits, particularly in Azad 
Kashmir, to destroy alleged terrorist camps of Jaish-i- Muhammad 
and Lashkar-i-Taiba.

They said that President Musharraf assured Mr Powel that Pakistan 
would definitely take action against any party or group provided it 
was given certain proof of the Dec 13 attack on Indian parliament.

Both the President and the foreign minister have reiterated their 
offer for a joint investigation to sort out the matter.

The sources said that the Bush Administration was of the view that 
both India and Pakistan should resolve their differences by talking 
to each other. Pakistan has also conveyed to the US government that 
the Indian government has been besieged by hawks to launch 
aggression against Pakistan. "But we have communicated to the US 
government that in case India commits aggression against us it will 
find us fully prepared to respond the challenge with full force," 
an official concerned said.

<a name="weha">We have no territorial aims: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Dec 20: Pakistan said it strictly believed in peaceful 
co-existence and had no territorial ambition against any country. 
However, any misadventure on our eastern border or the LoC (Line of 
Control) in Kashmir would be met with full force."

In a statement, Pakistan regretted that the Indian Prime Minister 
had rejected Islamabad's "eminently fair proposal for a joint 
inquiry" into the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament house 
building last week in New Delhi.

The statement released at a news conference at the foreign office 
disclosed that the diplomatic efforts were going on between 
Pakistan and India for peaceful resolution of the situation arising 
out of the terrorists' armed attack, apart from President's prompt 
condemnation of the attack and expression of sympathy with the 
bereaved families of those killed, though totally disowning 
Pakistan's involvement in it.

Spokesman Aziz Ahmad Khan said Pakistan was making all peaceful 
efforts not to allow the terrorist attack blamed on Pakistan by 
India, to escalate existing high tension between the two countries 
to get out of hand. President Musharraf's offer of joint inquiry 
was among the peaceful efforts being made, he said.

The statement said: "We apprehend that the terrorist attack was 
aimed at maligning and harming the legitimate Kashmiri struggle in 
the IHK (India-held Kashmir) for realization of Kashmiri people's 
inalienable right to self-determination. An impartial and 
comprehensive inquiry of the incident was necessary to unmask the 
motives and the ugly face of the perpetrators of this act of 
terrorism."

The statement went on to say: "We have noted the Indian prime 
minister's comment that 'the partition of the Indian subcontinent 
was a reality which should be accepted by all' and hope that the 
proponents of 'Akhand Bharat' would also hear and adhere to this 
sane advice."

The spokesman reiterated that the Kashmiris' struggle was a 
"genuine freedom struggle" and enjoyed Pakistan's full support, as 
also do all other similar freedom struggles round the world. He 
insisted that the world should differentiate between a freedom 
struggle and terrorism; and underscored that the struggle in the 
held Kashmir being waged in pursuance of the UN resolutions, which 
recognized the right to self-determination of the people of 
Kashmir, was rightly a genuine and indigenous freedom struggle.

Reported transfer of about 150 pro-Taliban Pakistanis from the 
northern areas of Afghanistan to India was a matter of concern and 
Pakistan was getting it verified, the spokesman said.

<a name="usst">US steps up pressure on CE to suppress extremists</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Dec 21: In the aftermath of attack on the Indian 
Parliament and its failure to capture Osama bin Laden the United 
States has increased political pressure on Gen Pervez Musharraf to 
clamp down on extremist groups operating in Pakistan.

Quoting Pakistanis with close links to Musharraf government the New 
York Times said: "By adding two more Pakistan-based groups to 
Washington's terrorism list, President Bush has sharply increased 
political pressures that have gripped Gen Pervez Musharraf, ever 
since the Sept 11 attacks."

The paper said in naming one of the groups, Ummah Tameer-i- Nau, Mr 
Bush said it had provided information on nuclear weapons technology 
to Osama's Al-Qaeda group, a charge Pakistan has insistently denied 
since the issue first arose in October.

The second group, Lashkar-i-Taiba, accused of involvement in last 
week's attack on the Indian Parliament, is the most powerful of the 
Pakistan-based groups fighting Indian forces in the disputed 
territory of Kashmir.

The NYT says that with his latest actions, particularly naming 
Lashkar-i-Taiba as a terrorist group, Bush appears to be pushing 
the Pakistani leader toward even greater political hazards. Kashmir 
is a far more sensitive issue for most of Pakistan's 140 million 
Muslims than the fate of the Taliban.

"What Bush is demanding now is that Musharraf make the biggest U-
turn yet," a former official with close links to the government 
said.

The paper observed that Mr Bush appears to have sided with India, 
and has told Pakistan that any further backing for armed Islamic 
militant groups operating in Kashmir will be tantamount to 
supporting terrorism.

In effect, the paper said Gen Musharraf appears to have been told 
that Pakistan, after more than 50 years of battling India over 
Kashmir, must now abandon the armed struggle there, and rely 
henceforth on political means of confronting India. The question 
now is whether the General will comply, and whether he can carry 
Pakistan's masses with him if he does.

"It places the General in an even more difficult position than he 
was in after Sept 11," the paper said.

Senior Pakistan officials said Mr Bush, with the blunt wording of 
Thursday's announcement, was accusing Mr Musharraf of lying in his 
government's repeated statements that the group was involved in the 
relief work in Afghanistan and had nothing to do with nuclear 
weapons.

<a name="lash">Lashkar may be declared a terrorist group by US</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza 

WASHINGTON, Dec 21: The action taken by the Bush administration 
against the Lashkar-i-Tayyaba and Umma Tameer-i-Nau (UTN), an 
organization linked to two Pakistani Atomic Energy Commission 
scientists, is seen here as being largely symbolic, but it is 
considered likely that the Lashkar may also soon be placed on the 
list of officially designated terrorist groups.

President George Bush has blocked the financial assets of the 
Lashkar and UTN, but since neither has assets here, the move is 
meant more as a signal directed at both India and Pakistan.

India had been complaining ever since last week's attack on the 
Indian parliament building that the United States had not taken a 
firm stand against so-called Pakistan-based militancy in Kashmir, 
and Thursday's decision is meant to soothe Indian sensibilities and 
prevent an India-Pakistan flare-up that may divert attention from 
the campaign against Al-Qaeda.

At the same time, it is a firm hint to the Musharraf government to 
take action against extremist groups based in Pakistan or having 
strong affiliations in the country. It is believed that in his 
telephone conversation with General Musharraf, Secretary of State 
Colin Powell had informed the general in advance of the action 
against the Lashkar and UTN, which is alleged to have supplied 
information on nuclear weapons to Al-Qaeda.

The only organization with ties to Kashmiri militancy on the US 
State Department's list of designated terrorist organizations so 
far is Harkatul Mujahideen. But the Lashkar and Jaish-i-Mohammad 
have been on a "Watch List" for some time.

The Lashkar is described in the official Patterns of Global 
Terrorism report issued last April as the "armed wing of the 
Pakistan-based religious organization, Markaz Dawa-wal-Irshad, a 
Sunni anti-US missionary organizations formed in 1989." It is 
defined as "one of the three largest and best-trained groups 
fighting in Kashmir against India." It has "several hundred members 
in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan, and in India's southern Kashmir and Doda 
regions."

It financial assets, according to Patterns of Terrorism, include 
donations from the Pakistani community in the Gulf, the UK, Islamic 
NGOs, and Pakistani and Kashmiri businessmen. It is possible that 
the US might put pressure on the Gulf and European countries to 
block the group's accounts and clamp down on remittances sent to 
it.

Jaish-i-Mohammad, another organization that could be targeted for 
inclusion on the State Department's list of designated terrorist 
groups, is described an Islamist group based in Pakistan that has 
rapidly expanded in size and capability since Maulana Masood Azhar, 
a former ultra-fundamentalist Harkatul Ansar leader, announced its 
formation in February.

Lashkar-i-Tayyaba was characterized by President Bush as a 
"stateless sponsor of terrorism" in remarks in which Mr Bush had 
underlined US desire to protect Indian democracy. But he had also 
said the organization wanted to destroy relations between India and 
Pakistan and "undermine" President Musharraf.

JODHPUR, Dec 20: India has begun moving hundreds of tanks and other 
army vehicles towards the Sindh-Rajasthan border, army officials 
and witnesses said.

In Jodhpur more than 500 tanks, army jeeps, trucks and medical vans 
had been seen moving towards the border from Tuesday night to 
Wednesday night. According to Indian officials, the frontier with 
Pakistan has been put on "high alert" since the Dec 13 attack on 
the Indian parliament.

Officials also said the Indian army had given instructions to the 
railway authorities that some local and long distance trains may be 
commandeered for troop movements. Leave for all railway employees 
has been cancelled. The transport authorities have also begun 
impounding civilian trucks and other heavy vehicles.

The Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indian Air Force have been 
put on high alert and senior BSF officer B.D. Sharma said Pakistan 
Rangers had been taking up positions on the other side of the 
border.-AFP

<a name="paki">Pakistan denies troop build-up: Sattar wants terrorism defined</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Dec 19: India has not provided evidence to Pakistan to 
substantiate its allegations that Jaish-i-Mohammad and Lashkar-i-
Tayyaba were involved in the Dec-13 attack on the Indian 
Parliament, the foreign office said.

"India has neither agreed to our suggestion for an impartial 
inquiry into the incident nor responded to Pakistan's request for 
evidence," said a statement issued by the foreign office.

There should be a universal definition of terrorism and terrorists, 
which could either be individuals or state, Foreign Minister Abdul 
Sattar said in response to Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari 
Vajpayee's statement.

Talking to Dawn on phone, Mr Sattar refuted Indian allegations 
against ISI for sponsoring terrorist attacks, and said that 
Pakistan had always condemned all forms of terrorism. He reiterated 
Pakistan's demand for an impartial inquiry into the terrorist 
attack of Dec 13. It was the typical Indian style of playing the 
role of complainant and judge at the same time, which, he said, 
could not be acceptable to any civilized society.

Commenting on the remarks of the Indian Prime Minister that India 
would not attack Pakistan, he said: "We have already adopted a 
policy of restraint."

Responding to allegations of Pakistan involvement, the foreign 
office said: "Past experience is witness that Indian authorities, 
motivated by prejudice and animus, resort to totally false and 
unsubstantiated allegations against Pakistan. "Only recently, on 
October 3, 2001, Indian accused Jaish-i- Mohammad and Pakistani 
intelligence of engineering the so-called hijacking of an Indian 
airline, flight CD 7444 but later discovered that the incident was 
due to a false alarm.

"More infamous was the 1971 hijacking incident of the Indian 
Airline plane Ganga to Lahore. Actually, it was an operation 
planned and executed by Indian Intelligence with the preconceived 
purpose of fabricating pretence in order to ban Pakistani 
overflights between East and West Pakistan preparatory to Indian 
military intervention in East Pakistan. The reprehensible episode 
is graphically depicted in 'Inside Raw' by an Indian author. A 
Pakistan judicial inquiry reached the same conclusion.

"Now as Indian authorities have once again jumped to an unwarranted 
conclusion, their accusations against Pakistan lack credibility. 
"If India really believes in its accusation, it should agree to an 
impartial inquiry. Its arrogation to itself of the roles of accuser 
as well as judge, is contrary to principles of justice and 
inadmissible under law."

AFP adds: Pakistan denied Indian allegation that its troops were 
amassing along the border with its nuclear rival, saying that New 
Delhi might be planning its own military build-up. "This is 
absolutely untrue," the military government spokesman, Major 
General Rashid Qureshi said.

"The only reason for spreading such reports is either they got 
wrong information or they are looking for an excuse to mass their 
own troops along the border with Pakistan." There were no troop 
movements on the Pakistani side, the top military spokesman said.

He accused Indian troops of launching a heavy mortar and rocket 
attack on border villages in Azad Kashmir in which three civilians 
were wounded. "It was absolutely unprovoked firing which continued 
for about two hours," he said, adding that Pakistani troops 
returned fire.

"We fired back and the Indians stopped the firing." Earlier, police 
in Pakistani Kashmir said Indian forces twice mounted heavy mortar 
attacks in the Samahni sector on the Line of Control. "The shelling 
was intense and without any provocation," police Senior 
Superintendent Tariq Ajmi told AFP. Mortar shells hit the villages 
of Dana and Kotli Khumba in Bhimber district, injuring three 
civilians including a woman, he said.

An army spokesman in Indian Kashmir had accused Pakistani troops of 
directing heavy mortar and machine-gun fire at Indian positions, 
causing panic among residents but no casualties.

Indian troops returned fire from their position in Nowshera, 420 
kilometres (250 miles) southwest of Indian Kashmir's summer capital 
Srinagar, he said.

Nowshera on the Indian side faces Bhimber in the northern part of 
Azad Kashmir. The exchange of fire was the first since India 
accused Pakistani military intelligence of helping plan last 
Thursday's suicide attack on the parliament building in New Delhi, 
which left 14 people dead, including the five gunmen.

New Delhi has demanded Islamabad take action against two Pakistan-
based Kashmiri militant groups, Lashkar-i-Tayyaba and Jaish-i-
Mohammad, for allegedly staging the operation.

Pakistan has denied any involvement of its intelligence services 
and warned India against taking reprisals. Vajpayee told parliament 
that every effort would be made to avoid a war with Pakistan, but 
warned that his government was keeping all options open in response 
to the attack on parliament.

ISLAMABAD, Dec 16: Pakistan refuted allegations levelled by India

activists of Jaish-i-Muhammad on the instigation of Inter-Services 
Intelligence agency.

Talking to Dawn on phone, President's spokesman Maj Gen Rashid 
Qureshi rejected Delhi police report, terming it a "baseless" and 
"concocted". The report has implicated Inter-Services Intelligence 
in the attack. "All these allegations are unfounded and 
fabricated," Maj Gen Qureshi said and reiterated the offer of 
cooperation made by Islamabad to New Delhi soon after the attack 
for holding a joint enquiry.

"We are ready to give a firm assurance that if on the basis of a 
joint enquiry anybody based in Pakistan was found involved in the 
attack we will proceed against him," the president's spokesman 
said. He pointed out that President Pervez Musharraf had already 
condemned the attack on the Indian Parliament as an act of 
terrorism and had assured Pakistan's full cooperation in its 
investigation.

When pointed out that Indian government had also rejected an offer 
made by the United States to spare Federal Bureau of Investigation 
for carrying out the investigation, he said, involvement of FBI 
would have eliminated the chances of fabrication of evidence.

He took serious exception to the tone and tenor adopted by the 
Indian government functionaries in the wake of the attack. The 
Indian leaders have started hurling threats of aggression, 
something which was totally uncalled for and unacceptable for 
Pakistan, he added. Pakistan armed forces, he said, were fully 
alive to the situation and prepared to thwart any act of aggression 
by India.

<a name="will">Pakistan will reply with force, says CE</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 15: President Gen Pervez Musharraf warned India that 
any adventurism against Pakistan would be met with force. In a 
television interview, he said: "I would like to warn against any 
precipitate action by the Indian government against Pakistan. This 
would lead to very serious repercussions and must not be done."

He condemned the terrorist act against Indian parliament, saying 
"we are against any such terrorist acts anywhere in the world, we 
strongly condemn it."

The president said, "we will cooperate as long as there is evidence 
against any individual or any group." He said "we would not like 
Pakistani territory to be used for any such terrorist act anywhere 
in the world and that also includes India."

"We would surely expect proof and evidence of involvement of any 
groups in Pakistan in this terrorist act. We will take action 
against anybody involved in Pakistan in these acts, if at all 
proved," he said. Whatever our analysis says the proof is not 
adequate at the moment. In fact, there are lots of indications, 
which may indicate the design behind this operation.

"So we would like to be very sure with concrete evidence that this 
is not the case and this is a terrorist act and if at all any one 
has been involved from Pakistan we would like to move against him," 
he said.

Pakistan armed forces were on high alert following threatening 
statements by Indian leaders after the attack on parliament in New 
Delhi.

President Musharraf said that India was trying to use Afghanistan 
to damage Islamabad's interests and asserted his government was not 
sponsoring any violence in occupied Kashmir. "India just wants one 
thing. They want to damage us. Anything they want to do in 
Afghanistan, the purpose is only one: How to do something, which 
will be used against Pakistan, that will damage their cause. That 
is their sole purpose," he said in an interview to the Far Eastern 
Economic Review. -Agencies

WASHINGTON, Dec 19: US Secretary of State Colin Powell said that 
cooperation with Pakistan on border control had been "absolutely 
superb" and Pakistan's military had been forthcoming in efforts to 
check Al-Qaeda fighters from crossing over from Afghanistan.

The secretary, who was talking to reporters after meeting the 
Belgian prime minister who is also current president of the 
European Union, said he had talked to Gen Pervez Musharraf on the 
telephone and thanked him for his country's cooperation. He said 
the US couldn't expect better support than it was already receiving 
from Pakistan.

<a name="flee">Fleeing fighters to be recaptured</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Dec 19: Additional troops of Pakistan army have been 
deployed to recapture the non-Afghan fighters who fled from the 
captivity of the law enforcing agencies when being escorted from 
Parachinar to Kohat, said Press Secretary to the President and 
Director General, ISPR, Major General Rashid Qureshi.

Talking to newsmen, he said additional troops had been deployed to 
recapture these non-Afghan fighters in the Parachinar area.

In an operation last night, the Pakistani forces had taken into 
custody over 100 non-Afghan fighters who were trying to enter 
Pakistan. This morning they were being shifted to Kohat from 
Parachinar in five or six vehicles. In the process, one of the non-
Afghans, travelling in a bus, overpowered a security guard, 
snatched his rifle, shot him and attempted to hijack the bus. On 
resistance by the bus driver, the non-Afghan fighter also shot him.

In the ensuing struggle, the bus overturned and fell into a 
roadside ravine, Major General Rashid Qureshi said.

A number of these non-Afghan fighters on the bus tried to flee. 
There ensued an exchange of fire between them and the security men. 
In this duel, a total of 13 people were killed, including one 
civilian and five security personnel, besides some six to seven 
from among the captured non-Afghan fighters, he said.

Some of the fleeing non-Afghan fighters were recaptured while a 
massive manhunt for the rest had been launched. Additional troops 
of Pakistan Army had already moved to the place of the incident, 
who immediately cordoned off the area.-APP

<a name="15ki">15 killed as Osama men try to escape</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Ismail Khan and Zulfiqar Ali

PESHAWAR, Dec 19: Fifteen people were killed, six of them members 
of Pakistan law-enforcement agencies, when Al- Qaeda captives being 
transported from the tribal area to a detention centre in Peshawar 
overpowered escorting guards, snatched weapons and opened fire, a 
senior government official told Dawn in Parachinar.

The incident occurred at Arawali, when 156 Al-Qaeda members 
arrested by the law-enforcement agencies at the Pakistan-Afghan 
border at Kurram Agency were being transported to Peshawar in three 
buses and two trucks.

According to the official account of the incident, at about 10:30am 
(local time), a group of 48 Al-Qaeda members, in one of the buses, 
attempted to overpower the driver and escorting guards. As a result 
of the ensuing melee, it said, the bus careened off the winding 
road near Arawali in the Frontier Region's Kurram and fell in a 20-
foot ditch.

Taking advantage of the situation, an official press note said, the 
Al-Qaeda men snatched guns and fled. During the exchange of fire 
between the Al-Qaeda men and the law-enforcement agencies, eight 
Al-Qaeda men were killed. Also killed in the gun battle were six 
members of the Kurram Levy and one Jawan of the Pakistan Army while 
six others received bullet wounds and were taken to the hospital 
for treatment.

The law-enforcement agencies pursued the fleeing Al-Qaeda men and 
succeeded in capturing 21 of them, while 18 others remain at large, 
and security cordon has been thrown in to capture them. Ten of 
those who escaped were arrested from a local school.

A senior government official said the 129 Al-Qaeda members still in 
custody, including the 21 recaptured after their escape, were being 
transported to Peshawar for interrogation amid heightened security. 
"We are not taking any chances now," the official said.

"They said something in Arabic among themselves, raised Allah- o-
Akbar (Allah is Great) and Al-Jihad (slogans) and pounced on us," 
bus cleaner Latif Hussain told Dawn. "We cried out for help," he 
said. The Al-Qaeda men snatched five rifles and escaped in two 
different directions. "One group fled towards the mountains and 
another towards the river," Home and Tribal Affairs Secretary Javed 
Iqbal said.

Latif said the Al-Qaeda captives were not handcuffed." They raised 
slogans of Al-Jihad the moment they were brought out of Parachinar 
jail. "Their slogans attracted quite a bit of crowd," eyewitnesses 
said. Government officials said a little over hundred members of 
law-enforcement agencies accompanied the Al-Qaeda men. Witnesses 
said the security detail was not adequate to escort battle-
hardened, well-trained Al-Qaeda fighters. "It looked as if they 
were being taken on a picnic," one witness remarked.

Government officials acknowledge that local tribesmen fully 
cooperated in apprehending the escaped prisoners. "We were offered 
money and were asked not to hand them over to the Pakistan 
authorities. They told us they waged a Jihad against the US and 
that the Pakistanis would turn them over to the Americans," Malik 
Zahid Hussain of village Bili Ameen who helped capture four said.

Last reports said a group of escaped prisoners had been engaged in 
Narai Tangi in Tuda Cheena area in F.R. Kurram. "They are firing 
with controlled fire. We hope to capture them soon," Javed Iqbal 
said. "We have cordoned off the area. The search is on and we hope 
to arrest them all," he told Dawn. He said the group of 156 Al-
Qaeda men had crossed over into Pakistan through the Mulla Bagh, 
Tandar Sar and Ghundao area on the Pakistan-Afghan border in four 
batches. The Al-Qaeda men were fleeing the Tora Bora region in the 
foothills of Spin Ghar that has seen relentless bombings by US 
warplanes for the past few weeks, he added.

Among the captives are Saudis, Malis, Yemenis, Tunisians, Turks, 
Algerians, Jordanians, Kuwaitis, Bahrainis, Bangladeshis, Tajiks, 
Iraqis, Sudanese, Syrians, Egyptians and Moroccans. Also among them 
is a French national of Arab origin identified as Abde Aziz Talabi 
and another Arab with a Swedish passport identified as Mehdi 
Mohammad Ghazali. Ghazali has a blank passport with no entry visa 
to Pakistan.

Government officials said four Al-Qaeda men accompanying the group 
died on their way due to hypothermia. "Their bodies are being 
retrieved from the mountains in a small hamlet called Chambak," 
they said.

Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding in Tora 
Bora, though Pakistani officials said they had no evidence to prove 
his presence there. "One group of people interrogated said it had 
seen Osama about a month ago in Tora Bora. Another said he had been 
seen about 20 days back. These people have not been subjected to 
real interrogation. I will not put any premium on that," Javed 
Iqbal said.

"The weather has turned ugly to his disadvantage because of the 
heavy snow in Spin Ghar. This will restrict his mobility. His 
supplies wouldn't last long and he will show up sooner than later," 
he commented.

The home secretary discarded reports that Osama might already have 
sneaked into Pakistan. "The chances are very very slim. There is a 
bounty on his head, plus the army deployment on 25 points along 
with levy and military forces along the tribal border with 
Afghanistan plugging all possible escape routes would make it 
impossible for him to sneak in."

Our Kohat Correspondent adds: About three dozen men from army's 
special services group joined the regular army troops in an 
operation launched for arresting the Al-Qaeda members who are still 
at large in the Mandal mountains in the Arawal area in the lower 
Kurram Agency.

At least 48 Al-Qaeda members had escaped from a truck while on 
their way to Peshawar from Parachinar jail. The four trucks were 
carrying 48, 48, 29 and 31 Al-Qaeda prisoners.

The commandos were airlifted to the top of the mountains in 
helicopters from the Kohat air base to search for the missing Al-
Qaeda members. Two gunships were also helping the ground forces to 
locate the hiding Al-Qaeda members.

The whole area has been cordoned off by the army troops whereas 
more militiamen have been dispatched from Parachinar to the area. 
The military and civil authorities, supervising the operation hoped 
that all the Al-Qaeda men would be arrested by Thursday as all 
escape routes from the mountain area have been sealed.

The authorities have shifted the remaining Al-Qaeda members to 
Alizai sub-jail. An official told Dawn that the Al-Qaeda members 
would be shifted to Peshawar sometime on Thursday in special 
trucks, sought from the Peshawar police department.

<a name="15al">15 Al-Qaeda men shifted to Peshawar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

KOHAT, Dec 19: The military authorities shifted 15 Al-Qaeda members 
arrested on Wednesday in Kohat to Peshawar amid tight security for 
interrogation by a Joint Investigation Team at the Special Branch 
headquarters.

The Al-Qaeda members which include nine injured Arabs, are the 
citizens of Egypt, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan who had been 
fighting along with the Taliban in Afghanistan since 1994. 

There had been no information about one body of an Arab recovered 
from a coaster on Wednesday last, one of the officials 
interrogating the Al-Qaeda members told Dawn on Sunday last. Two of 
them are the drivers of coasters in which they were being taken to 
Peshawar from North Waziristan Agency.

The Al-Qaeda members were shifted to Peshawar in an army vehicle 
escorted by a military team.

The Arabs, during the preliminary interrogation, revealed that 
until October there were 7000 foreigners in Afghanistan, excluding 
Pakistanis. Most of them were sheltering near the Pakistan-Afghan 
border whereas some of them were accompanying Osama bin Laden or 
were still in hiding inside Afghanistan.

They told the army intelligence officers that in 1999 the total 
number of Arab fighters in Afghanistan was 9000. The army source 
when asked about the whereabouts of the remaining 2000 Arabs said 
that he could not disclose this but admitted that they were not in 
Afghanistan now and had left to other countries.

All the arrested Arabs were very critical of the role of the 
Pakistan government for supporting the US-led coalition and accused 
President Gen Pervez Musharraf of betraying the Muslim freedom 
fighters and Taliban, an investigation officer told Dawn.

<a name="usma">US may seek increased pressure on Jihadi groups</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NEW YORK, Dec 16: The United States plans to increase pressure on 
Pakistan to curb the activities of two Mujahideen groups after a 
suicide attack on the Indian Parliament that killed seven people, 
said the New York Times quoting American officials.

The paper says that in its efforts to obtain the continued 
cooperation of Pakistan in the fight against Osama bin Laden and Al 
Qaeda, the Bush administration had refrained from pushing too hard 
for it to clamp down on the two organizations, Lashkar-i-Taiba and 
Jaish-i-Muhammad, which operate openly in Pakistan and advocate 
violence to drive India out of Kashmir. But India's accusation that 
Lashkar-i-Taiba was behind the dramatic shootout and Jaish-i-
Muhammad claim of responsibility for a similar attack on the Indian 
Legislative Assembly in Kashmir that killed 40 people in October 
has forced a tough re-evaluation by Washington, the paper said.

Pakistan has "told us that they are planning on moving gradually to 
curb this kind of extremism," a senior State Department official 
told the Times. "I think what this means is if these groups are 
indeed carrying out these kinds of attacks, that process will have 
to be accelerated."

A Western diplomat in Islamabad concurred, saying the Bush 
administration will push Pakistan to restrain militant groups to 
try to reduce tensions with India over Kashmir, a predominantly 
Muslim border region that India considers a state in its union. 
India has demanded that Pakistan shut down both groups.

The Times noted that Pakistan has long identified Islamic groups 
fighting against Indian control of Kashmir as freedom fighters and 
tolerated their activities even in the post-Sept 11 era. The 
government has started to crack down on radical religious schools, 
which provided training grounds for fighters who joined the 
Taliban, and has begun to purge its powerful intelligence service 
of pro-Taliban elements in response to American pressure. But 
Kashmiri Mujahideen groups retain strong backing from elements of 
the military dictatorship and the public, so the government has 
been reluctant to restrain them and risk internal problems.

The leader of one such group in an interview with the paper said 
that his organization was told by government officials to move its 
headquarters to Azad Kashmir region and lower its profile, but he 
said nothing was mentioned about stopping its attacks on Indian 
outposts. "All they told us to do was move our visible means of 
operation out of the spotlight," said the leader.

Similarly, Lashkar-i-Taiba recently moved its offices out of 
Islamabad and took down the signs at its huge training compound 
near Lahore, but foreign intelligence officials said the 
organization continues to train freedom fighters there. Lashkar-i-
Taiba, or Army of the Pure, is led by a former university 
professor, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, who has continued to give fiery 
public speeches denouncing the American-led coalition's war in 
Afghanistan and warning President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan not 
to "sell out" Kashmir the way he sold out the Taliban, the paper 
said.

The group, the Times noted has taken credit for many attacks on 
Indian soldiers in Kashmir, but a spokesman said that it was not 
responsible for the attack on the Indian Parliament, which shook 
the world's largest democracy. Jaish-i-Muhammad, which means Army 
of the Prophet Muhammad, also operates openly despite American 
requests that Pakistan freeze its bank accounts and curtail its 
activities after the Oct 1 suicide attack in Srinagar in Kashmir.

<a name="newd">New Delhi warns of 'hard-hitting' response</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Dec 16: Indian officials squarely blamed Pakistan's 
intelligence agencies for last week's audacious armed attack on 
Delhi's Parliament House and Home Minister Lal Krishan Advani said 
New Delhi was considering an as yet unspecified but a decidedly 
hard-hitting response which did not exclude a hot pursuit of 
militant targets across the border.

The more or less clear hint to the road ahead came from Advani 
himself, who said: "During the Kargil war, world leaders who used 
words like restraint and patience to nudge and shape India's 
approach to the crisis have dropped the words since Thursday. That 
is significant."

Advani, told the popular Aaj Tak news channel that the Indian 
people wanted hard action against the culprits of Thursday and the 
government understood their anxiety. He said India was not waiting 
for any response from Pakistan to its Friday's demarche and would 
take any suitable action at its own convenience without consulting 
any other country.

Advani's remarks came as Delhi Police Commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma 
said that the attack on Parliament House was carried out by 
"members of the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit Jaish-i-Mohammed at 
the behest of Pakistan's Inter Services Intelligence (ISI)."

Sharma told a news conference that four persons - Mohammed Afzal, 
Shaukat, Shaukat's wife and Abdul Rehman Geelani, a professor at 
the Zakir Hussain College of Delhi University, - had been arrested 
in connection with the attack.

Afzal and Shaukat - commission agents and residents of Sopore in 
Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district - were the brains behind the 
conspiracy, he said. They were being motivated by Ghazi Baba, 
described as a top commander of the Jaish in Kashmir, to carry out 
the attack, he said.

The Jaish is headed by Maulana Masood Azhar, one of the militants 
released in exchange for Indian Airlines plane hijacked to Kandahar 
in December 1999.

In some very significant ways Sharma's story was at stark variance 
with the brief on the attack given to the media by Prime Minister 
Atal Behari Vajpayee among others.

Vajpayee had told journalists at a media seminar that the 
terrorists were well prepared and had been trained for months to 
carry out the attack on the Parliament House. He said their motive 
was to kill MPs and to take hostages to press for some unspecified 
demands.

Sharma said that Geelani and Shaukat's wife had revealed that the 
conspiracy was hatched at Shaukat's residence in Delhi's Mukherjee 
Nagar recently. But perhaps even more significantly, he said: 
"These people went to the airport first, but later changed their 
mind and headed towards Parliament."

The move to switch their target from the airport to the British-
built Parliament House obviously could not have been part of any 
well-trained or rehearsed attack on the parliament, or the heart of 
Indian democracy that Vajpayee spoke of, analysts said.

Sharma said that though the ISI had told the Jaish and Lashkar-i-
Tayiba to carry out the attack, the actual attack was carried out 
by members of the Jaish. Before the attack took place, the leader 
of the suicide attack squad - Mohammed - had called up Shaukat and 
told him to watch television and tell them which of the prominent 
parliamentarians were present in the House, he said. However, when 
Shaukat did not call back, the terrorists decided to go ahead with 
the attack, he said.

<a name="saar">Saarc summit in doubt as tempers rise</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Dec 15: A spiraling verbal duel between India and 
Pakistan, triggered by a terrorist attack on New Delhi's Parliament 
House, could derail an important summit of regional countries in 
Kathmandu of which both are members, diplomats and officials said.

Leaders of the seven-member South Asian Association for Regional 
Cooperation (Saarc) are due to meet from Jan 4 for three days in 
the Nepali capital, but diplomats said a fresh crescendo of words 
between the Saarc's two largest neighbors could force a fresh 
postponement of the meeting.

"We are prepared for both the options," an Indian official involved 
with the preparation of the summit in Kathmandu told Dawn. "If the 
need arises we may be forced to sort out our problems with Pakistan 
first. We can't have much to talk at this stage of mistrust."

Indian news reports said Delhi had "moved from accusing Pakistan's 
homegrown terrorists for Thursday's attack on Parliament to showing 
Islamabad a gloved fist". Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee 
declared at Kolkata that India's "limits" of tolerance had been 
reached. Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha went a step further 
saying "all options were open" when asked about the possibility of 
a retaliatory war against Pakistan.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pramod Mahajan said in a programme 
on BBC that although he could not discuss the next step that India 
would take in a public discussion, "Yet I can say what we have said 
in our cabinet meeting. We will liquidate terrorists whereever they 
are."

In the program, India's supercop K.P.S. Gill, however, cautioned 
against a growing demand within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party 
to do everything possible, even if it means going on a hot pursuit 
across the border, to punish the wider network of the suspects in 
Thursday's attack. Five militants were killed and seven Indians 
including five security personnel with the audacious attack.

Sinha, addressing a meeting in Chennai, said the government was 
"keeping all its options open" when asked whether a war with 
Pakistan was possible after the attack on Parliament. Asked whether 
the country's economy could withstand the stress of a war, Sinha 
said: "We have a strong and resilient economy, which can take 
anything."

Sinha said the country could face a war, without any cess being 
imposed. "Even during the Kargil conflict, people predicted some 
new taxes. I did not levy any," he said. "The mood of the country 
is the same as was in the United States after the Sept 11 attacks," 
he added.

In Kolkata, Vajpayee warned Pakistan, saying the country had 
reached the "limits" of tolerance. In an obvious reference to 
Pakistan, the Prime Minister said Indian troops could have crossed 
the border during the Kargil conflict, but "we exercised restraint 
and only snatched back our land."

"We have exercised much restraint in the past and now our tolerance 
has reached its limits. We will face terrorism with all our might," 
Vajpayee said during a visit there.

"We are being advised again to show restraint, but we tell our 
advisers to convey to our neighbour that there is a limit to our 
tolerance," the Prime Minister said. Ridiculing Pakistani 
propaganda that India itself had engineered the attack on 
Parliament, Vajpayee said, "We have found out who was behind it." 
Recounting the Dec 13 attack, he said the plot was basically to 
eliminate the entire leadership of the country. "I shiver to think 
what would have happened had even a single terrorist managed to 
enter the Central Hall of Parliament."

On resuming talks with Pakistan, Vajpayee said he went to Lahore to 
seek friendship, but Pakistan had resorted to treachery. "We got 
Kargil in return," he said.

<a name="amon">Pakistan among 48 'not free' countries: study</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Arshad Sharif

ISLAMABAD, Dec 15: Pakistan is ranked among the 48 countries 
labeled as "Not Free" and denying their citizens political rights 
and civil liberties, a study titled "Freedom in the World 2001-
2002" by the US based Freedom House said.

The study by the Freedom House concludes that there is a dramatic, 
expanding gap in the levels of freedom and democracy between 
Islamic countries and the rest of the world. The study, Freedom in 
the World 2001-2002, finds that a non-Islamic country is more than 
three times likely to be democratic than an Islamic state.

In all, according to the report, there are 86 free countries, 
representing 2.54 billion people and 41.40 percent of the global 
population in which basic political rights and civil liberties are 
recognized.

There are 58 partly free countries in which there is limited 
respect for political rights and civil liberties. These states also 
suffer from an environment of corruption, weak rule of law, ethnic 
and religious strife, and often a setting in which a single 
political party enjoys dominance despite the facade of limited 
pluralism. Approximately 23.25 percent of the world's population, 
1.43bn persons, live in such partly free societies.

There are 2.17bn people, 35.35 percent of the global population, 
living in 48 "Not Free" countries, where basic political rights are 
absent and basic civil liberties are widely and systematically 
denied. Political rights and civil liberties are more limited in 
these countries, in which corruption, dominant ruling parties, and, 
in some cases, ethnic or religious strife are often the norm.

At the end of 2001, there were 121 electoral democracies among the 
world's 192 states. The 1987-88 survey found just 66 of 167 
countries were electoral democracies. The number of new 
democratically elected governments has increased by 55 over the 
space of 14 years, an average of nearly four per year, the report 
states.

In Asia, the report points out, 18 of the region's 39 countries are 
Free (46 percent), 10 are Partly Free (26 percent), and 11 are Not 
Free (28 percent).

The report states that since the early 1970s, when the third major 
historical wave of democratization began, the Islamic world, and, 
in particular, its Arabic core have seen little significant 
evidence of improvements in political openness, respect for human 
rights, and transparency.

"Of the 192 countries in the world today, 121 are electoral 
democracies; but in countries with an Islamic majority, only 11 of 
47 have democratically elected governments, or 23 percent." In the 
non-Islamic world, there are 110 electoral democracies out of 145 
states, over 76 percent, the report said.

The report said that while electoral democracies are the norm in 
over three-fourth's of the world's non-Islamic states, in countries 
with a majority Islamic population there are 10 presidential - 
parliamentary democracies and one parliamentary democracy.

At the same time, the report said, within the Islamic world there 
are nine countries with authoritarian presidencies, there are seven 
with dominant party states in which opposition parties are nominal, 
there are six with presidential-parliamentary systems with features 
of authoritarian rule, there are nine traditional monarchies, there 
are three one-party states, there is one military-ruled state, and, 
until November there was one fundamentalist theocracy, Afghanistan 
under the rule of the Taliban.

In a comparative analysis, the report said, 20 years ago, there was 
also one Free country among states with a majority Islamic 
population, while there were 20 that were Partly Free and 18 not 
free. By contrast, at the close of 1981, the rest of the world 
registered 50 free countries (the majority of them from Europe and 
North America), 31 partly free countries, and 42 not free

<a name="peop">People want Nawaz or Benazir as PM: study</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 16: The voters' response in the third phase of the 
local government elections has shown that people are likely to 
elect either Benazir Bhutto or Nawaz Sharif as the next prime 
minister in preference to president Gen Pervez Musharraf, a study 
by an NGO said.

In a study conducted by the Pattan Development Organization on 
"Local Government Elections 2001-Phase III, IV and V" when asked 
who would be a better future prime minister or the head of the 
government, 38 per cent of the voters opted for Benazir Bhutto, 20 
per cent for Nawaz Sharif and, only nine per cent thought General 
Musharraf would be better.

Analysis of the councilors' political trends, showed that the PPP 
hardcore councilors were much more likely to opt for Benazir 
Bhutto. However, approximately 44 percent of Benazir's support came 
from councilors who have never voted for the PPP in the last four 
national assembly elections. Only 5 per cent of the PML supporters 
opted for Nawaz Sharif; 67 percent wanted Gen Musharraf as their 
future leader.

A large number of councilors from diverse backgrounds have been 
mobilized into local politics as a result of the devolution plan.

The performance evaluation of the government by the elected 
councilors is variable in different regions with a sense of 
alienation in Sindh.

According to the Pattan study, alienation is highest amongst 
councilors in the districts of Sindh where local government 
elections were held in phase III. The army rule and the protests 
against the government's water policy may have influenced the low 
ratings in Sindh, the study said. On the other hand, the rating of 
Punjabi councilors on the performance of the present government is 
consistently lower than in Balochistan on all issues, but higher 
than Sindh. 

The study further discloses that the labor class and the farmers 
are the least satisfied on the issues of inflation control, ending 
corruption, and instant justice. The government's rating was very 
low on the issues of employment and inflation control according to 
the councilors.

In the urban-rural analysis, the study shows, the councilors from 
the urban areas were much more satisfied with the government on 
almost all issues except the attitude of the local officials.

The study said that when asked which era was the best in the 
history of Pakistan, 28 percent of the voters, ranked Zulfiqar 19 
percent opted for General Ayub, 18 per cent General Zia; 16 per 
cent Benazir, 10 percent Nawaz Sharif, and 8 percent General 
Musharraf.

<a name="zard">Zardari set to be released after five years in jail</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

RAWALPINDI, Dec 21: Asif Ali Zardari, the spouse of PPP chairperson 
Ms Benazir Bhutto, has not been served arrest warrant so far in a 
new case and now he is set to be released after undergoing a five-
year term of jail. Farooq H. Naek advocate, counsel of Asif 
Zardari, told Dawn.

He said in all the cases, three cases were fixed for hearing before 
two accountability courts in Rawalpindi. "No court has so far been 
intimated about the issuance of fresh arrest warrant of Asif Ali 
Zardari in a new case," he said.

Earlier, the NAB officials said that Asif Zardari would be arrested 
in a new case involving the import of a BMW car in the name of a 
student. The government, soon after granting him bail in all the 
pending cases, has framed a new case against Mr Zardari.

Farooq H. Naek said that hearing in Steel Mills, ARY Gold and SGS 
references was held. The first two references were adjourned but in 
the SGS case the prosecution prayed the court to issue a letter of 
rogatory for obtaining more documents from the Swiss government.

The counsel of Asif Zardari was left with no time to reply to the 
arguments for the issuance of letter of rogatory. The case was 
adjourned till January 7.

Asif Zardari, who is behind the bars since November 1996, was 
granted bail in the last case. Mr Zardari could not be released 
because the process of submission of sureties could not be 
completed due to Eid holidays.

Asif Zardari is presently lodged in Pakistan Institute of Medical 
Sciences (PIMS) which has been declared sub-jail.

Mr Zardari is facing thirteen different cases of criminal and civil 
nature. He has been granted bail in twelve cases and in one case 
the Prosecutor General Accountability stated before the LHC that 
Asif Zardari was not arrested in polo ground reference and would 
not be arrested without the prior permission of the court.

Mr Zardari is simply an accused in pre-shipment case 1999, assets 
case of sending artifacts to England, SGS/Cotecna case, Polo Ground 
case, Steel Mills case, ARY Gold case and Tractors' import case. He 
is on bail in Mir Murtaza Bhutto murder case, Justice (Retd) Nizam, 
Alam Baloch and Sajjad Hussain Bukhari cases and a suicide attempt 
case.

LAHORE, Dec 16: District and Sessions Judge Rana Zahid Mahmood 
admitted former MNA Asif Ali Zardari to bail in the narcotics 
smuggling case registered against him by the Lahore police in 1997. 
Asif Zardari was ordered by the court to be released on furnishing 
two sureties of the sum of Rs1 million each. He is stated to have 
been shifted back to the Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, for completing 
the formalities for his release.

Earlier, during the hearing of the case held in the Kot Lakhpat 
Central Jail, Zardari's Counsel Farooq H.Naik argued his case for 
the grant of bail. He submitted that the case had been pending for 
the past four years without the recording of substantial evidence.

The accused, the counsel further submitted, had been implicated in 
the case on the basis of a statement by Arif Baloch during the 
police custody. According to the counsel, the statement against 
Zardari had been procured under duress only to implicate his 
client. He further submitted that the Supreme Court had already 
granted bail to Zardari in all the other cases pending against him.

Prosecutor Iqbal Bhatti opposing the plea for the bail submitted 
that the bail in earlier cases had been granted by the Supreme 
Court on medical grounds and not on merit.

<a name="sher">Sherpao to be arrested on arrival</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 15: Former NWFP chief minister Aftab Sherpao, who 
may return home on Jan 5, will be arrested the moment he lands in 
the country, said NAB Prosecutor General Raja Bashir, answering a 
question. He said: "Though I have no knowledge about his return, 
the moment he arrives, he will be arrested for being an absconder".

Aftab Sherpao, who went abroad after corruption references had been 
filed against him for abusing his official authority, is reportedly 
reaching Peshawar on Jan 5 from London after a brief stop-over in 
Qatar. 

Political observers believe that his presence in the country could 
be beneficial in rebuilding ties with the post-Taliban government 
in Afghanistan as Sherpao commands a considerable influence on his 
people - Pakhtoons.

Mr Sherpao had been declared proclaimed offender by an 
accountability court in Peshawar and was later convicted to three-
year rigorous imprisonment under section 31-A of the NAB Ordinance 
for neglecting court's orders.

<a name="deni">Sherpao denies secret deal with govt. </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Dec 21: Former NWFP chief minister and chief of his own 
faction of the PPP, Aftab Ahmad Khan Sherpao, has denied that his 
expected return to Pakistan is a result of a secret deal with the 
present government. "I am reaching on Jan 6 in Peshawar to play my 
role in the national politics," he vowed.

Speaking to newsmen from London by telephone at the Peshawar Press 
Club, he said he had faced darkest period of Gen Ziaul Haq boldly 
and never opted for a secret deal with the martial law regime at 
that time.

The PPP leader said the party workers had asked him to come back 
and play his role in the coming elections.

Mr Sherpao said that the imposition of military rule had created a 
vacuum between politicians and workers, saying he had decided to 
bridge this gap by leading the people. He underlined the need for 
setting aside all differences in the larger interest of the 
country, which according to him was undergoing a tough period after 
threats of attack from across the border.

He urged the rulers to remove what he called the sense of 
deprivation among the smaller provinces by taking concrete steps. 
He feared that the growing sense of uncertainty might worsen the 
situation in the smaller federating units.

He urged the political parties to forge unity among themselves to 
save the country from the external threats. He supported the 
government stance on war against terrorism and its decision to join 
the US-lead coalition as it was the only option for the government.

He severely criticized Ms Benazir Bhutto's recent statements in 
India and termed them against the national interests.

<a name="firs">Pakistan gets first tranche of $109m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter 

KARACHI, Dec 21: Pakistan has received $109.5 million as first 
tranche out of the $1.3 billion poverty reduction and growth 
facility from the IMF. The country will get the entire amount in 12 
equal installments in three years.

A spokesman for the State Bank told Dawn that, with the inflow of 
this amount into SBP account, Pakistan's liquid foreign exchange 
reserves had risen to $4.632 billion. Of this, $2.96 billion was 
held by the State Bank and $1.66 billion by all other banks, he 
added.

The spokesman said that, on December 8, gross liquid foreign 
exchange reserves stood at $4.56 billion, including $2.85 billion 
held by the central bank and $1.61 billion held by all other banks.

Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves had begun to rise after the 
September 11 attack on the US. At the end of September, the 
reserves stood at $3.3 billion, including $1.7 billion held by the 
SBP and $1.6 billion held by other banks, the spokesman said.

The spokesman said the combined result was that gross foreign 
exchange reserves, that stood at $3.3 billion at the end of 
September, had now risen to $4.62 billion. This $1.3 billion build-
up in reserves was also due partly to a $600 million aid from the 
US in recognition of Pakistan's support to its war in Afghanistan, 
he added.

<a name="pari">Paris deal to improve cash flow by $2.7bn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 15: The Paris Club's $12.5 billion debt rescheduling 
will provide an exceptional cash flow savings of $2.7 billion for 
the next three years, enabling the government to increasingly 
divert resources to social sectors.

"For the current financial year, this cash flow saving amounts to 
$1.1 billion which will now help us in improving our social 
indicators effectively," said Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz. He 
said the net present value of debt reduction was 30 percent, which 
he termed "highly favorable to Pakistan."

He said now that the Paris Club has restructured Pakistan's $12.5 
billion debt for 38 years, he would be holding separate meetings 
with the bilateral creditors to negotiate new interest payment 
rates on these loans.

"Currently, a 2.2 per cent interest rate is being charged and 
hopefully we will get it further reduced," the finance minister 
said. He said that about 70 per cent of the $12.5 billion was an 
Official Development Assistance (ODA) and had been offered on 
concessional terms.

The Paris Club, he said, had set the deadline of Sept 30 next year 
to conclude bilateral agreements for settling new interest rates on 
these $12.5 billion loans.

Pakistan owed $5 billion to Japan, $3.1 billion to USA, $1.1 
billion to France, $1 billion to Germany and $650 million to South 
Korea, he said.

The present value of debt-to-export ratio was 334 per cent which 
has now been reduced to 240 per cent due to an unprecedented long-
term debt relief offered to Pakistan. "This package is called 
'Islamabad terms' which is unique unlike Houston, Naples or Cologne 
terms, which do not provide so much debt relief".

However, he said that Pakistan will have to implement a set of 
reforms to continue receiving uninterrupted debt relief from its 
bilateral creditors. "We have committed to adhere to certain 
economic discipline and to have transparency in our financial 
system," he said, adding that in case Pakistan did not fulfil its 
commitments, the whole favour done by the Paris Club could be 
withdrawn.

Part of the debt has been converted into debt swap by some 
countries, including Canada and the United Kingdom, he said, adding 
that $100 million loan had been written off while $400 million debt 
had been converted into debt swap, now to be spent on improving 
social services. The strategy for overcoming debt burden has been 
extensively discussed with members of the Paris Club and that is 
why a major debt relief has been extended to Pakistan, he said.

"I think this needs to be appreciated that ours is a first 
government which successfully completed three-year IMF program 
which in fact provided a basis to the Paris club to go for such an 
unprecedented favour of offering stock re-profiling of debt to 
Pakistan," the finance minister said.

"We have been given a post-cut off date treatment on our loans and 
that is why people at the Paris Club meeting said that we had got 
non-standard terms which I believe is a great success on our part," 
he claimed.

<a name="adbo">ADB okays $200 million loan for roads</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Dec 19: The Asian Development Bank has approved $200 
million loan for Pakistan's road sector. With this amount, the 
country's road sector at national and provincial level will undergo 
some major reforms.

According to a press release, the Road Sector Development Program 
consists of a US$50 million loan to reform national policy and a 
US$150 million loan for a Provincial Sector Development Project.

The policy loan will help the national road agency deliver services 
more effectively. It will rationalize staffing, develop standard 
operating procedures and enhance staff accountability in project 
management, the release said.

It will also encourage investment based on economic principles, 
self-financing maintenance, and an approach to road safety that 
includes raising public awareness.

ADB Resident Representative, Mr M. Ali Shah commented that policy 
reforms "are critically needed to increase the efficiency of the 
road and transport sector at the national and provincial levels."

The programmatic approach adopted will sequence activities in 
various provinces, starting with the Sindh province.

The Provincial Sector Development Project component comprises 
sector reforms and an investment program. At the provincial level, 
the reform program will help the Sindh Communication and Works 
Department become an efficient institution that can provide safe, 
cost-effective, and well-maintained roads.

The project includes investments to improve 164km of provincial 
highways and 1,200km of rural access roads. Poverty reduction will 
be a key theme for the identification of rural roads located in 
districts with high incidence of poverty.

As the Project takes a sectoral approach, core rural access 
sections have been selected from three disadvantaged districts, 
namely (i) Kamber-Drigh Road via Village Bhunda Khamiso, (ii) 
Awidh-Jamrao Head via Khudadino Gahu, and (iii) Tangwani-Bugti via 
Shahi Wah.

ADB's policy loan will come from its ordinary capital resources 
under its LIBOR-based facility. The amortization period is 15 
years, including a grace period of three years.

Half of ADB's project loan will come from its concessional Asian 
Development Fund and half from ordinary capital resources under the 
LIBOR-based facility. The total cost of the project is US$236 
million. Apart from the ADB, the government will provide US$71 
million and the OPEC Fund will inject US$15 million. The Project is 
due for completion in 2007.

<a name="atta">Attack on Lok Sabha halts KSE rally</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Aslam

The KSE 100-share index finished at 1,380.08 on selling prompted by 
the reports of terrorist attack on Indian parliament and its 
negative impact on Pak-Indian relations.

Textile shares responded bullishly to 7 per cent import tariff 
exemption by the European Union on textiles and proposed increase 
in export quota by 15 per cent but the absence of leading buyers 
and bargain-hunters added to the prevailing sluggishness.

The snap rally aided by strong institutional support raised the 
hopes of advent of year-end buying but attack on Indian parliaments 
again reversed the market trend.

Prices fell under the lead of pivotals earlier in the week on 
selling. Daily traded volume shrank to below 30 million-share mark 
and the index was marked down below its support level. All eyes 
remained focused on the PTCL board meeting and hopes of some 
positive announcement in regard to widely speculated interim 
dividend, but there was none till the close and the consequent 
selling.

The KSE index early was up by about eight points on active support 
ahead of the PTCL board meeting and the market talk of an interim 
dividend but as there was no announcement from its management till 
the closing bell, weakholders took profit at the initial rise.

"Reports trickling in from Islamabad PTCL board meeting indicated a 
rise in the quarterly after-tax profit to Rs4.22 billion but in the 
absence of any official announcement on the subject, traders sold 
in part their long positions", analysts at the W.E. Financials 
said.

"No business no margins", they jokingly said commenting on the 
falling daily volumes below the average figure of 100 million to 30 
million shares. However, some of the news, notably 15 per cent 
increase in the textile quota by European Union including the US 
and some positive developments on the privatization front of the 
PSO evoked good interest earlier in the week but as the follow-
support lacked, most of the pivotals reacted on selling.

"The market seems to have digested all good news on the aid front 
and is in search of some fresh stimulants to keep it in a good 
shape", stock analysts at the AHRL said.

"Whether or not the investor perceptions assisted by counter market 
forces will play their due role in the sessions prior to the eid 
holidays is unclear", they added. But stock analysts at the Moosani 
Securities believe the current sluggishness is temporary as the 
market has now a viable financial base on which it could build a 
strong rally before the year is out.

It was perhaps in this background that the broader market performed 
well, while pivotals finished reacting under the lead of Shell 
Pakistan and Noon Pakistan, which fell by Rs1.95 to 2, while others 
fell fractionally.

The BOC Pakistan again responded favourably to 100 per cent final 
cash dividend plus 20 per cent bonus shares adding another Rs20 to 
the weekend gain.

Others to follow it were the Century Insurance, Farooq Habib 
Textiles, Ismial Industries, Al-Ghazi Tractors, Millat Tractors, 
Quetta Textiles, Kohinoor Weaving, Bhanero Textiles, Rupali 
Polyester, Dawood Hercules, the PSO, Pakistan Telephone Cables 
after the announcement of 15 per cent dividend, and several others.

Losers were led by the EFU General, New Jubilee Insurance, Gatron 
Industries Din Textiles, the ICI Pakistan, Shell Pakistan, Murree 
Brewery, Faisal Spinning, Noon Pakistan, falling modestly but the 
largest decline of Rs15 was noted in the Rafhan Maize Products for 
no apparent bearish reasons.

The trading volume shrank to a lowest weekly total owing to two 
closures and light ready volumes, falling to 130 million shares 
from an average figure of 500 million shares in normal trading 
sessions.

The most active list was topped by the Hub-Power, the PSO, the PTC, 
which accounted for 70 per cent of the total volume followed by the 
ICI Pakistan, Adamjee Insurance, Engro Chemical, Nishat Mills, Sui 
Northern Gas, the MCB, Japan Power, Fauji Fertiliser, Telecard and 
D.G.Khan Cement.

KARACHI, Dec21: The KSE 100-share index breached through the 
barrier of 1,400 points at 1,404. The market's buoyant mood was 
also well-reflected in the KSE 100-share index, breaching the 
psychological barrier of 1,400 points at 1,403.97, up 18.65 points 
as all the leading base shares recovered smartly.

Textile shares led the market advance on active support aided 
apparently by the perception of reopening of the vast Afghan market 
after the end of war. All the leading shares rose in unison, major 
gainers among them being Bhanero Textiles and Fazal Textiles, which 
rose by Rs.2.90 and 4.50.

Other leading gainers included PSO and Shell Pakistan, which 
recovered overnight losses, up by Rs.3.75 and 3.35, followed by Al-
Ghazi Tractors, ICI Pakistan, Trust Modaraba, Jahangir Siddiqui and 
Co, Legler Nafees, PICIC, Inter-Asia Leasing 8th and 10th ICPs and 
several others, rising by one rupee to 1.50.

Losers were led by Paramount Spinning, Ideal Spinning, Zahidjee 
Textiles, and Attock Refinery, off Rs.1.05 to 1.90, while all other 
losses were fractional.

Plus signs were again strewn all over the list, with leading shares 
finishing with smart rallies under the lead of PSO and ICI 
Pakistan, which at one stage failed to find sellers even at the 
rising prices.

Trading volume rose to 79m shares as advancing shares forced a 
strong lead over the losers at 104 to 39, with 32 holding on to the 
last levels.

Hub-Power again topped the list of most actives, up 20 paisa at 
Rs.18.40 on 34m shares, followed by PTCL, up 15 paisa at Rs.16.15 
on 18m shares, PSO, higher by Rs.3.75 at Rs.101.35 on 9m shares, 
ICI Pakistan, up Rs.2.90 at Rs.5m shares and Engro Chemical, off 55 
paisa at Rs.57.25 on 4m shares.

Other actives were led by Sui Northern Gas, higher 30 paisa on 
3.478m shares, Adamjee Insurance, higher Rs.1.65 on 3.461m shares, 
MCB, firm by 20 paisa on 1.995m shares, Nishat Mills, steady by 
also 20 paisa on 1.919m shares and Fauji Fertilizer, firm by five 
paisa on 1.750m shares.

FUTURE CONTRACTS: Speculative shares on the forward counter also 
followed the lead of the ready section and generally finished with 
an extended gains of Engro Chemical January settlement and PSO, 
both contracts, which rose by Rs.2.30 and 3 to 3.60 at Rs.58.20, 
101.15 and 102.00 in that order.

Hub-Power again led the list of actives, up 18 paisa at Rs.18.40 on 
3.195m shares followed by PTCL, firm by 15 paisa at Rs.16.15 on 
1.570m shares. Others were traded modestly barring Hub-Power 
January delivery, off 26 paisa at Rs.18.66 on 0.584m shares.

DEFAULTER COMPANIES: Allied Motors came in for renewed support and 
was marked up by 40 paisa at Rs.3.50 on 9,000 shares.

Having received many such messages from builders I am tempted to 
presume that Mr Ikram could be an irate builder. He may be 
interested to know that subsequent to my column there was yet 
another fire in the same Karim Centre which caused further damage 
to property.

However, my sympathies are with Mr Ikram as far as his 14 rupees 
are concerned. He could switch papers and go for one of our other 
English language paper which carry news that is well worth its 6 
rupees selling price. For instance: Dateline Lahore, Dec 10 - "From 
our Correspondent: Punjab's oldest man, a heejra (eunuch) Guru Lal 
died at the age of 155 in Lalamusa. According to eunuch tradition, 
Guru Lal had celebrated his chehlum in his lifetime some five years 
ago and these celebrations had continued for a full two weeks. All 
participating heejras were given a golden ring each as a gift by 
the guru who hailed from an influential Chaudhry family of the 
area.... Guru's chailas rushed from every nook and corner of the 
province on hearing about his death and attended his funeral and 
burial at a local graveyard ..." Anybody who is anybody in our 
country is always 'rushing'.

>From this point onwards, Mr Ikram and his 'likeminded' can stop 
reading and move on.

>From the beginning of this year, Governor of Sindh Mohammadmian 
Soomro and his colleagues have been trying to pass an ordinance to 
regularise illegal buildings. A comprehensive note headed 
'Regularisation of buildings which cannot be regularised as the law 
presently stands' was given to the director general of the Karachi 
Development Authority, another retired brigadier, Zaheer Kadri, and 
was discussed by the governing body of the KDA, the chief 
controller of buildings, also a retired brigadier, Zafar Malik, and 
the oversee committee of the Karachi Building Control Authority. 
Just before leaving on his annual Umra trip this Ramzan, the 
Governor relented, signed and promulgated the Sindh Building 
Control (Amendment) Ordinance 2001.

It is extremely difficult to draft a 'bad' law. Credit must be 
given to the members of the Sindh cabinet and the Governor for 
making a complete hash of things. They, the builders and their 
supporters are of the opinion that this Ordinance permits the 
regularization of buildings built in violation of the approved 
building plan and/or the provisions of the Karachi Building and 
Town Planning Regulations 1979. This opinion is reinforced by the 
fact that a few of those who have raised illegal constructions are 
now approaching buyers, who have made bookings in their projects, 
to pay them money and have their buildings 'regularized'.

Members of the KBCA Oversee Committee have also been approached to 
clarify the position prevailing after the promulgation of the 
Amendment. Accordingly, with a view to safeguard the public 
interest and prevent anyone making financial gains under false 
pretexts, certain members of the Committee requested fellow law 
member Advocate of the Supreme Court Barrister Qazi Faez Isa to 
consider the matter and give a legal opinion. He did so, pointing 
out that any attempt on the part of the Government to regularise 
illegal buildings would be invalid because it would be based on a 
confusion of the concept of criminal liability with that of civil 
liability, and that too, despite the very clear pronouncements by 
the Superior Courts of Pakistan to the contrary. 

His opinion concludes: "It is therefore patently clear that the 
Amendment does not permit the 'regularization' of any building." 
Faez's opinion was shown to Senior Supreme Court advocates, 
Barrister Khalid Anwer and Barrister Naimur Rahman who also are in 
agreement.

The following resolution was tabled at the last meeting of the 
Oversee Committee of the KBCA on December 12 and was approved by: 
Engineer Kalimuddin, Engineer Nooruddin, Architect Thariani, 
Engineer de Souza, Barrister Isa, and me. The sponsor supporters of 
the Ordinance, the government men Brigadier Qadri, Brigadier Malik, 
and Builder Butt, naturally dissenting.

"The Oversee Committee constituted under Section 4-B of the Sindh 
Building Control Ordinance to oversee the functioning of the 
Authority clarifies that the recently promulgated SBCO (Amendment) 
2001 does not permit the regularization of any building or 
construction raised in violation of the approved building plans 
and/or the provisions of the Karachi Building and Town Planning 
Regulations 1979. Further, this stand is borne out by the decision 
of the Honourable Sindh High Court in the case of Feroza Hajiani 
vs. Abdul Razzak (1992 MLD 527) which was upheld by the Honourable 
Supreme Court in the case of Abdul Razzak vs. KBCA (PLD 1994 SC 
512) and reaffirmed by a Full Bench of the Honourable Supreme Court 
in the case of Ardeshir Cowasjee vs. KBCA (PLJ 1999 SC 2331)."

An excerpt from Faez's opinion: "The Ordinance stipulates that 
those raising illegal constructions commit a crime. Upon being 
convicted they can be imprisoned and/or fined. The mere fact that 
the convict has served out his sentence and or paid the fine would 
not convert the illegal construction into a legal one. Such a 
suggestion would not only be wholly illegal but also completely 
absurd. It would be like a person who was convicted for stealing a 
car contending that since he has served out his imprisonment and or 
paid the fine imposed on him he now gets to keep the stolen car.

"Despite clear legal provisions, futile attempts have been made to 
equate compounding of offences with 'regularizing' illegal 
construction. In the case of Feroza Hajiani vs. Abdul Razzak (1992 
MLD 527) just such a view was canvassed which the honourable High 
Court recorded as under :

"'Karachi Building Control Authority contended that the authority 
is competent under Section 19(1-A) of the Sindh Building Control 
Ordinance 1979 to compound offences under the Ordinance and 
regularise construction of building made in violation of the 
building regulations. He referred to regulations 16 and 20 of the 
Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations 1979 as such 
Regulations, according to him, spell out power to regularise 
constructions made in contravention of the Building Regulations.'

"The aforesaid contention was strongly rebutted by the High Court, 
holding that:

"'This power conferred on the authority or its authorised person by 
the provision of subsection 1-A of Section 19 of the Ordinance and 
Regulation 16(1) of the Regulations is analogous to the right to 
compound offences and the power to permit compounding of an offence 
contained in section 345, Cr.PC. Compounding of an offence it its 
ordinary sense means that a person against whom an offence has been 
committed agrees with the accused that he will not prosecute him on 
the condition of the latter making reparation. It is simply a 
composition reached on the basis of a compromise that the accused 
will not be prosecuted in a Court of law. This process merely 
absolves the accused or the offence from being prosecuted and saves 
him from the possible punishment on certain terms and conditions, 
but it cannot absolve him from the other consequences, as provided 
in the regulations, or contravention thereof. It cannot, therefore, 
be said that the power to compound an offence is synonymous with 
power to 'regularise' erection of a building in violation of the 
regulations or that compounding of an offence ipso facto amounts to 
such 'regularisation'.

"The High Court held that :

"'Regulation 16(1) of the Regulations requires the authority to, 
inter alia, require any person who has carried out building work 
contrary to the provisions of the regulations to show cause why 
such building works or part thereof shall not be removed or altered 
to comply with the regulations and by regulation 16(2), paras (a) 
and (b), the Authority shall require such person, if he fails to 
show sufficient cause, to demolish the whole building or part 
thereof or to alter the works so as to bring it in conformity with 
the Regulations. It, therefore, follows that the Legislature 
intended that any building or a part thereof erected in 
contravention of the Regulation must be removed or altered to 
conform to the Regulations.

"'... there is no power in the Authority and any of its officers to 
condone violation of the Regulations by regularising a building 
erected in contravention thereof. Authority and/or its officers can 
only compound the offence after a delinquent building has put the 
building in order in accordance with the Regulations.'

"The aforesaid judgment was upheld by the Supreme Court in Abdul 
Razzak vs. KBCA (PLD 1994 SC 512).... Subsequently, a Full Bench of 
the Supreme Court in the case of Ardeshir Cowasjee vs. KBCA (PLJ 
1999 SC 2331) specifically endorsed Abdul Razzak as laying down the 
correct legal position and overruled the case of Multiline 
Associates vs. Ardeshir Cowasjee (PLD 1995 SC 423) if it was 
construed to be in any manner inconsistent with the judgment in 
Abdul Razzak."

This bad ordinance does not affect the lives of the law-abiding 
people of Karachi which are protected by the Constitution, and, 
particularly by the fundamental rights enshrined therein.

<a name="thes">The subcontinent's way of doing business</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

The threats held out to Pakistan in the Indian Lok Sabha by Mr L. 
K. Advani, India's paramount hawk, are strictly in line with a 
tradition of sabre-rattling which has dogged the footsteps of both 
India and Pakistan these last fifty years.

Whatever the occasion, bellicosity and belligerence come more 
readily to us than any show of restraint or reason. This baleful 
legacy awaits a touch of grace or statesmanship before it will be 
banished.

No doubt the terrorist attack on the Indian parliament has been 
dangerous business, fraught with mischief. We have to thank 
subcontinental inefficiency - a tradition as rooted as sabre-
rattling - that the terrorists involved botched their operation. 
What if they had entered the parliament building and held any 
number of MPs or even ministers hostage? That would have brought us 
dangerously close to war.

India has squarely blamed Jaish and Lashkar-i-Taiba and, by 
extension, Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence. Unless all the 
facts are in, and India is not being particularly helpful in 
allaying Pakistan's concerns in this regard, judgment on this score 
must be suspended. But one thing is for sure. Pakistan's 
intelligence outfits would have to be insane to be involved in any 
plot as irrational as this. It is not in Pakistan's interest to be 
accused of 'terrorism' or to do anything that compromises the on-
going struggle in Kashmir. Why should Pakistan be involved? What 
does it gain by it?

Which is not to say Indian outrage is not understandable. Those of 
us in Pakistan who suggest that India itself could be behind this 
act in order to malign Pakistan are being unfair. It is a bit like 
saying that the Israeli secret service, Mossad, was behind the 
September 11 attacks on the US. There is nothing more absurd than 
conspiracy theories stretched beyond the limits of credulity. But 
this is the spirit of India-Pakistan relations: tending to believe 
the worst of each other.

The war of words we at have at present - with Mr Advani holding out 
the threat of hot pursuit across the Line of Control and President 
Musharraf saying that any Indian aggression will be met with force 
- is troubling and dangerous but unlikely to escalate into anything 
hotter because the last thing both countries want is another war. 
It is also noticeable that while Mr Vajpayee has said that India 
was keeping all options open, all in all he has taken a mellower 
line than his home minister (Advani).There is also the American 
reaction to consider. With other eggs to fry in its 'war on 
terrorism', the US is urging restraint on both sides. So it is a 
fair bet that while the histrionics will go on for some time, we 
are not looking at the opening stages of a fourth Indo-Pakistan 
war.

India will milk the Lok Sabha attack for all it is worth in a bid 
to convince the US that it should pressure Pakistan to put a stop 
to the 'jihadi' activities of Jaish and Lashkar-i-Taiba. Like other 
governments in such situations, the BJP's saffron leadership will 
also not be averse to drawing domestic mileage from showing a tough 
face to Pakistan. Jingoism plays well in all elections and with the 
UP elections in India coming up, the BJP has everything to gain by 
looking tough. All the same, it would be facile on Pakistan's part 
to reduce the Indian reaction to the Lok Sabha attack purely to 
electoral considerations. There is more at stake in the Indo-
Pakistan equation than merely the number of seats the BJP is set to 
win or lose in the Lucknow assembly.

For India the US war on Afghanistan has been a deeply frustrating 
experience. It had hoped that with the US turning its guns on the 
Taliban, Pakistan as their chief foreign backer would be boxed into 
a corner. Even before the US asked India for anything, India had 
made every offer of assistance. Sadly for India, geography stood in 
its way because as a launching pad for a war on Afghanistan, 
India's usefulness was not half that of Pakistan's. The US did not 
spurn India's frantic offers of help. It just ignored them and took 
Pakistan on board. Indian protestations about Pakistan's 
involvement in 'terrorism' in occupied Kashmir fell on deaf ears in 
Washington. As India seethed with fury, Pakistan, far from being 
bracketed with the Taliban, became the linchpin of the strike on 
Afghanistan.

Now out of the blue comes the terrorist attack on the Lok Sabha. 
India would have to be more saint-like in its behaviour than states 
usually are not to exploit the situation to its advantage. It is 
perfectly understandable, therefore, if Pakistan once again finds 
itself in the Indian firing line. But perhaps it is important to 
understand that more than any attempt to intimidate Pakistan, India 
is playing to the international gallery in order to put indirect 
pressure on Pakistan. For what India wants above all is the death 
of militancy in occupied Kashmir. Anything to achieve that end, 
including the threat of war.

But not war itself. For all the talk from New Delhi of crossing the 
Line of Control, embarking on such a course is easier said than 
done. Pakistan is no pushover and entering Azad Kashmir by no 
stretch of the imagination is the same as Israel's incursions into 
Palestinian territory. In fact, it is hard to imagine anything more 
foolish or risky at the moment than an Indian military adventure 
against Pakistan. India is not strong enough, nor Pakistan weak 
enough, for such a venture to succeed. Moreover, American attention 
is absorbed elsewhere. The last thing the US wants is a 
subcontinental distraction.

So what is India up to? The continuation of politics by other 
means: the threat of war and the liberal use of propaganda, all 
aimed at isolating militancy in Kashmir, tarring it with the brush 
of terrorism and making it untenable for Pakistan to render any 
worthwhile assistance to the Kashmiri struggle for self-assertion.

>From India's point of view these are worthy aims. But from the 
standpoint of the subcontinent's future they merely hark back to 
the politics of the last fifty years. The question is not what 
India or Pakistan can gain in the short-term but what they can do 
to turn their backs on the past and chart a long-term relationship 
that saves them from the expense of useless militarization.

Not for any abstract reason, or anything grounded in idealism, is 
this important but because, deny as much as the hawks on both sides 
may, history and geography condemn the destinies of both countries 
to be intertwined. This is no aspersion on India's size or economic 
clout, just an admission of reality. It is no more possible for 
Pakistan to think that it can look westward and close its eyes to 
India's existence than for India to presume that bigness and 
economic success place it beyond the necessity of coming to a 
rational understanding with Pakistan.

The logic of force has not worked in Kashmir. If it has been 
impossible for Pakistan to decide the issue by a clash of arms, it 
has been no more possible for India to crush the post-1989 
resistance by a recourse to repression. The resulting stand-off has 
embittered the Kashmiri people, for whose presumed sake both 
countries have deployed their armies in Kashmir, and kept both 
countries locked in a futile conflict.

Point-scoring and sabre-rattling are games both countries can play. 
There is nothing new in this since this is what they have been 
doing since 1947. Anyone except unreconstructed hawks would think 
it was time to move on.

But two truths have to be accepted before any forward movement is 
possible: (1) that Kashmir, without any ifs and buts, is a problem 
awaiting a final solution; and (2) that while a miracle would be 
welcome, there is no immediate solution to this problem. Once 
understanding is achieved on these two points, the problem of 
militancy can be addressed.

If Pakistan at this stage expects anything more than an acceptable 
form of words regarding Kashmir, it will be guilty of a lack of 
realism. If India thinks it can attain the end of militancy without 
even making a verbal concession, it too will be living in a 
paradise of its own.

To unbiased observers this would look like a sensible trade-off. 
After all, the major concession would be coming from Pakistan and 
only a semantic one from India. But India's problem is different. 
It cannot abide any sort of concession, no matter how 
inconsequential, to Pakistan. For the thing it detests above all is 
to be hyphenated with Pakistan - as in "India-Pakistan relations" - 
and to be seen on a par, even if for a fleeting moment, with 
Pakistan. This is a psychological barrier which India alone can 
cross.

<a name="amer">America first</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

As war drums beat louder than ever in South Asia and the Middle 
East, the faint promise that some good might come out of the 
September 11 attacks in the United States is quickly evaporating.

In both regions, the vague prospects of peace have been effectively 
derailed by a combination of suicide bombings and cynical leaders. 
Ironically, the compulsions of forging a makeshift coalition in the 
'war against terrorism' had raised hopes that some of the 
underlying causes of the September 11 attacks - like the occupation 
of Palestinian territory by Israel - would at last be addressed. 
Indeed, President Bush's statement that he accepted the idea of a 
Palestinian state encouraged many into thinking that a sea change 
had occurred in American policy.

Similarly, repeated western pledges 'not to walk out of 
Afghanistan' this time were widely believed. Many saw an era of 
continued engagement in the region as Afghanistan was rebuilt after 
two decades of warfare, and its institutions restored. In this 
rose-tinted scenario, a reformed Pakistan would re-enter the fold 
of respectable nations and a combination of American pressure and 
persuasion would be brought to bear on New Delhi and Islamabad to 
resolve the festering Kashmir problem.

In brief, a better world would emerge from the rubble of the World 
Trade Centre, and those thousands of lives would not have been lost 
in vain. Now welcome to the post-Taliban world of realpolitik: the 
rhetoric from Delhi gets shriller and more bellicose, and is 
matched by the violent words and actions emanating from Tel Aviv. 
Mercifully, as I write this, the shelling in the subcontinent is 
limited to that unfortunate punching bag, Kashmir. But unless 
cooler heads and common sense prevail, things can spiral quickly 
out of control. If this happens, the terrorists who attacked the 
Indian parliament last week would have won.

The common strand that runs from the subcontinent to the Middle 
East is the harsh reality that when the push comes to a shove, 
long-term self-interests are more important than the temporary 
expedients that briefly hold wartime coalitions together. Thus, the 
cold war succeeded the alliance between the Soviet Union and the 
western powers immediately after the Nazis had been defeated. And 
following the recent defeat of the Taliban and Al-Quaeda, signs of 
strain in the American-led coalition are already evident. Indeed, 
the earlier clarion calls for rebuilding a devastated Afghanistan 
are very muted now, and the billions of dollars being bandied about 
seems more and more like the election pledges of politicians rather 
than the basis for a real plan of action.

In the Middle East, Sharon has cleverly used the recent Palestinian 
suicide attacks against the Israeli occupation to draw parallels 
between his country's situation and the September attacks against 
America, thus gaining Bush's support for the bloody reprisals and 
state terrorism against the Palestinians. Now the Israelis want to 
send Arafat packing just as Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden were 
evicted from their positions of power. Bush, seeking to secure more 
Jewish votes in the next election than he managed in his 
controversial victory last year, is more than willing to support 
Sharon.

In the subcontinent, the Americans are equally ready to press 
Musharraf to crack down on terrorist organizations like the 
Lashkar-i-Taiba and the Jaish-i-Mohammad, accused by New Delhi of 
being behind the attack on the Indian parliament. I have long been 
of the view that these extremist outfits are a danger to Pakistani 
civil society and need to be crushed. However, by making a 
hysterical demand for action, Vajpayee has placed the Pakistani 
president in a very awkward position: if he cracks down on them, he 
will be accused of caving in to Indian pressure. If he does 
nothing, he will be seen as being soft on terrorism by Washington. 
Musharraf has tried to find some wriggle space by condemning the 
attack and offering a joint inquiry, but this has been predictably 
rejected by New Delhi. Had Vajpayee resorted to quiet diplomacy, 
Musharraf could have found a face-saving way out, taking action 
against those behind the attack while being seen by his domestic 
critics as independently moving against a domestic threat.

Another myth to have been exploded in the aftermath of the 
'victory' over the Taliban and Al-Quaeda is that Bush had moved 
towards multilaterlism after his initial unilateral approach 
following his first few days in the presidency. It was widely 
assumed that his earlier rejection of the Kyoto accord and the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty would be tempered with a more 
internationalist attitude towards world affairs because of the 
American need to forge an alliance against terror. This view, too, 
has had to be changed in the light of events: when the Americans 
realized that most of the world that counted was more or less 
obliged to follow where they led, they have again returned to 
unilateralism. Against every expectation and prediction, the Muslim 
world did not explode into flames as the Americans bombed 
Afghanistan for weeks; the Russians have jumped on board with great 
enthusiasm; and the Europeans (most notably Britain) have served as 
cheer-leaders and hand-maidens. 

So the question now probably being asked in Washington is: why do 
we have to modify our policies and priorities when the rest of the 
world is willing to play ball according to our rules? Why indeed? 
The hard reality is that as the sole superpower, the United States 
is able and willing to enforce its diktat around the world. And if 
somebody doesn't like it, tough. There is much unease among 
America's current allies about the possibility of an attack on Iraq 
despite the lack of any evidence linking it with the events of 
September 11. But Bush and his right-wing coterie are fully aware 
that if they do decide to go after Saddam Hussein, there won't be 
much anybody will be able to do about it. But this kind of 'America 
first' approach is likely to prove self-defeating as it will 
further push desperate men into taking desperate action. While Al-
Qaeda may have been destroyed, the motivation of its cadres and its 
many admirers and supporters remains undiminished.

<a name="icca">ICC assures PCB of logical solution</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Dec 20: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has received a 
favorable response from the International Cricket Council (ICC) on 
express pacer Shoaib Akhtar's bowling action row, a top official 
said.

"The ICC will have to consider our point of view on Akhtar's 
bowling action case and I am confident it has to end in our favor," 
Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia said.

Tauqir Zia had a detailed telephonic conservation with ICC 
President Malcolm Gray who assured him of a logical solution of the 
case. "The PCB is talking logic and wants a logical solution and I 
am sure that we will win the case," he said.

The PCB still awaits official response from the ICC of its letter 
sent alongwith Western Australian University report earlier this 
month.

Shoaib, currently regarded as one of the fastest bowlers in the 
world, is embroiled in a row after his action was reported 
suspicious for a third time last month.

The PCB sent the footage of his questionable action during the 
Sharjah tri-series last month to the Western Australian University, 
which maintained that Akhtar's action is the same and gives 
illusion of chucking due to hyper mobility of his bowling arm.

The same university gave all clear to Shoaib's action when it was 
reported for the second time in New Zealand in March this year. The 
action first came under suspicion in December 1999 when Pakistan 
played against Australia.

"The ICC would have to consider the WA University's report and Gray 
has assured me that the report will be given due consideration. The 
PCB has never thought of taking the ICC head on because we think 
the ICC is the supreme body and we are there to strengthen its 
arms," the general said.

"Gray and ICC Chief Executive Malcolm Speed are reasonable people 
and have been very helpful."

The ICC had invoked stage two of its process while dealing with 
bowlers with suspect action and had appointed former West Indian 
pacer Micheal Holding to assist Akhtar remove flaws in his action 
last month.

The ICC had set Feb 22 as the deadline to complete stage two of the 
process. After the stage two is over, and if Akhtar's action is 
reported again within 12 months of the third report, stage three 
would be invoked.

The PCB in its reply had ruled out the utility of stage two and had 
demanded that stage three should be invoked.

Under the ICC's process, stage three brings into action a panel of 
experts which, if it feels Shoaib's action remains suspected, can 
ban the bowler for a year.

When asked would Pakistan demand its representation on the ICC 
Review Panel, Tauqir said Pakistan may seek Australian expert's 
help to clear Akhtar. "I would not go for any player, but I would 
go for an Australian expert to fight Akhtar's case if the case is 
passed to the ICC Bowling Review Panel," he added.-SADA

<a name="refu">India refuses to play alongside Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Dec 19: India has refused to play alongside Pakistan in 
next month's six-nation hockey event in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 
sources said.

"India has pulled out from the six-nation event without giving any 
reason. But the apparent reason for their withdrawal is that they 
don't want to play alongside Pakistan as tensions heighten between 
the South Asian rivals," sources told SADA.

The organizers had confirmed last week that India would be one of 
the six teams alongside reigning Olympic and world champions 
Holland, Pakistan, Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand in the event 
scheduled to be held from Jan 20-27. The teams will play a round-
robin preliminary round and the top two teams will contest the 
final.

The tournament has been arranged by the Malaysian Hockey Federation 
to provide the national team with quality practice matches ahead of 
the World Cup Finals, which will be held here from February 24 to 
March 9.

Malaysian organizers said they would not seek a sixth team after 
India's pullout. Pakistan and India have had few sporting contacts 
in the last two years. Cricket has been the worst hit sport.

India refused to take a Test tour of Pakistan in December last 
year, pulled out its team from the Asian Test Championship in 
September and did not play Pakistan in multi-national events in 
Sharjah and Canada.

India alleges that Pakistan is fomenting trouble in Indian-
administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for harboring last 
week's attack on its parliament that left 12 people dead and has 
threatened to attack parts of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

The fortunes of eight-time Olympic champion India have revived with 
the country's triumph at the Junior World Cup in September. The 
senior team won the Champions League in Kuala Lumpur last week. -

<a name="shah">Shahbaz can be an inspiration</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Dec 19: Manager of the hockey team, Brig Khalid Sajjad 
Khokhar believes that veteran Shahbaz Ahmed could play a leading 
role in inspiring Pakistan at next year's World Cup in Malaysia.

Khokhar, speaking to Dawn, said that Shahbaz is the kind of player 
whose brilliance can change the entire complexion of the game in no 
time. "Just a couple of his passes in a match could do the trick 
for us."

Khokhar however said that the biting Rotterdam cold proved to be a 
handicap for his players not used to playing in such conditions. He 
conceded though that Shahbaz was not utilised properly in that 
tournament.

"The Champions Trophy is behind us and now we will be working on 
new ways how best to utilise Shahbaz and not to repeat our 
mistakes."

The pencil-thin Shahbaz had underlined his status as the world's 
best dribbler in 1994 when he led Pakistan to World Cup victory in 
Sydney and retired soon afterwards. He made a controversial 
comeback at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics but failed to impress much. 
He had not played top class hockey since 1998 and was the Pakistan 
coach weeks before the Rotterdam Champions Trophy.

The Pakistan camp in preparation for the World Cup and a six- 
nation tournament that precedes that is set to start at Lahore from 
Dec 24.

Khokhar said that in the camp they would especially focus on 
helping defenders Tariq Imran and Sohail Abbas improve their 
tackling and clearance. "I personally think that their tackling is 
not clean which leads to short corners and at times penalty 
strokes."

Although Khokhar refrained from making any tall claims for the 
World Cup being held in February, he did say that they would put in 
their best. "The level of competition between the top teams these 
days is such that it is difficult to predict the outcome of a 
tournament."

"We have a competition before the World Cup which has six nations 
and is a Champions Trophy in its own right. So doing well in that

The six-nation event will see besides Pakistan, Holland, Australia, 
New Zealand, India and hosts Malaysia fight it out for gaining a 
psychological advantage going into the World Cup.
