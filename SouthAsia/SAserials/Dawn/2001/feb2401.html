<a name="cabi">Cabinet approves rise in gas prices</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Feb 21: The cabinet on Wednesday approved an
"unspecified" increase in the price of natural gas for all kind of
consumers - industrial, commercial, domestic and CNG (vehicle
fuel).

The federal cabinet decided that domestic tariff of natural gas for
those consuming up to 100 cubic metres would remain unchanged. The
consumers using more than 100 cubic metres will have to pay higher
rates.

Briefing newsmen after the meeting, Abdullah Yousaf, secretary,
Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources said that the cabinet
mandated the ministry to increase the price, but the exact increase
would be known after a few days. The ministry has to make fresh
calculations in light of the directions of the chief executive.

The official said that the government was giving a total subsidy of
Rs6.0 billion to domestic consumers. He claimed that the coming
increase would not affect 40 per cent of the domestic consumers,
who are consuming only up to 100 cubic metres.

The remaining 60 per cent domestic consumers would have to pay
more. The official said that a Rs12 billion subsidy to the
fertilizer industry would continue as it was the government's
policy to control the input cost of agricultural products.

He said that the upward revision of the gas price would be in
accordance with the increase in the price of crude oil as the
government had to pay more to the gas producers.

Under an agreement with foreign gas producers, he said, the
government had to review the gas rates after every six months.

He said that all over the world the domestic tariff of natural gas
was higher than the industrial tariff except in Pakistan where it
is the other way round.

<a name="govt">Govt to check income of Jihadi outfits</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 19: The government on Monday vowed to stand firm to
check religious violence and sectarian terrorism in the country and
announced to probe the credentials and funding of the religious
organizations involved in Jihad.

An interior ministry spokesman, in a statement here, said that in
the larger national interest it was very important to keep such
activities under control.

"Government's sincere efforts in this respect should not be seen as
anti-Jihad or anti-Islam, rather it is equal to dancing to the
tunes of our enemies."

The government, he said, would welcome organizations collecting
funds for the welfare and relief of Kashmiri refugees but they
would have to do it in an organised manner. "The government would
like to verify the credentials of such organizations and keep
account of their income and expenditure, so that no vested interest
could exploit the name of Jihad and refugees to fulfil its own
nefarious designs."

The spokesman maintained that donation boxes had been placed in
shopping centres, everywhere in the country, but no one knew the
details of the funds collected. "This situation is totally
unacceptable," he categorically said.

Such activities, he said, had helped our enemies to portray
Pakistan as a terrorist state, which was very dangerous for
national development, economy, stability and its image as a
tolerant nation.

Referring to the Jihad in Kashmir, the spokesman reiterated that
the government stood firm behind the freedom struggle in Kashmir
with all political, moral and ideological support. "There is no
question of backing out of the support which the government and the
people of Pakistan are extending towards the indigenous freedom
struggle in Kashmir."

However, he lamented that there had been mushroom growth of dubious
outfits, including some sectarian militant groups in the country,
who were busy cashing on the sacrifices of Mujahideen in Kashmir
without their funds being audited.

Referring to the latest remarks attributed to the interior minister
regarding checking the militancy in the country, the spokesman
clarified that the remarks made in all sincerity and good faith had
been deliberately twisted by few "unscrupulous elements" to grind
their own axes.

The spokesman also mentioned display of arms by some elements and
said that the natural outcome of increased militancy and violence
was the open and blatant display of weapons and "gun culture" in
the society.

"This dangerous trend had to be stopped and the government banned
the display of weapons in the larger interest of state and its
citizens." He said that all the provincial and federal governments
had been asked to make sure that all illegal, un-Islamic and
immoral activities of display of arms were stopped.

He claimed that the government had a firm resolve to do its duty to
bring peace in the society and create an atmosphere of tolerance
according to the golden principles of Quran and Sunnat and human
values as demonstrated by the Holy Prophet (PBUH).

The spokesman sought citizens support and cooperation to make the
country a peaceful place to live but warned all those who wished to
impose their will on the majority and broke the law to check
militancy in the country.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: A three-member US Congressional delegation met
the chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, on Thursday and
discussed with him various aspects of bilateral relations.

the steps being taken to restore democracy, including the holding
of the local bodies elections, according to a Foreign Office press
release.

The delegation was led by David Bonior and comprised Joseph Pitts

<a name="poli">Policies to be guarded under new NSC: CE</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haq

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf said here
on Thursday that a National Security Council (NSC) would be
established to ensure continuity of government policies.

"The chief executive assured businessmen on Thursday that an NSC-
type body will be set up with a view to ensuring continuity of
government policies," said Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz.

He told reporters that the CE had met more than 50 experts,
economists and top businessmen on Thursday and discussed with them
a number of issues, such as the establishment of the NSC, cut in
the defence budget, improvement of relations with India and an
offer of maximum investment incentives to overseas Pakistanis in
the next budget.

The finance minister said Gen Musharraf had told the participants
of the meeting that his government had decided not to increase the
defence budget in real terms, adding that the purpose was to give
positive signals to India indicating that Islamabad wanted peace in
the region.

"The chief executive told the meeting that the defence expenditure
will be kept flat in real terms. This (defence) budget has to be
kept in line with inflation rate," said the finance minister.

When asked whether the CE had talked about revival of assemblies,
the finance minister chose not to comment. He said: "The CE told
the participants that his government wanted to protect his various
actions and policies by having an institution like the NSC soon."

Mr Aziz quoted the CE as having told the participants that he was
all for normalizing relations with India. The CE had observed that
Pakistan was trying to establish good political and economic
relations with India, the finance minister said.

"I am ready to meet the Indian leadership any time, anywhere to
forge better ties with India," Mr Aziz quoted the chief executive
as having said. The CE had agreed with the participants that peace
overtures should continue to be made so that relations between
India and Pakistan could improve, the finance minister said. "The
general (the CE) stressed the need for holding talks with India,"
Mr Aziz added.

"Overseas Pakistanis will be given more concessions in terms of
paying any taxes," the finance minister said, adding that new
industries to be set up by the overseas Pakistanis would be tax-
free and would have additional facilities.

 The finance minister said the government would encourage non-
repatriable investment by the overseas Pakistanis for which a new
policy would be announced in the next budget.

He said the CE had also agreed with the participants of the meeting
that the confidence of local and foreign businessmen needed to be
restored. "The freezing of foreign currency accounts in 1998 did
not go well with the investors," he said.

<a name="indi">India trying to mislead world, says Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: Pakistan on Thursday demanded India respond to
its long-standing invitation to allow Kashmiri leaders to visit
Islamabad for talks to kickstart a formal peace dialogue.

A foreign office spokesman in a statement described Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's decision to extend the truce for
three months as "yet another attempt...to mislead world opinion".

The statement said India was repeating old allegations against
Islamabad and trying to malign the Kashmiri "freedom struggle"
instead of responding positively to Pakistani initiatives to reduce
tension and start a peace process.

"The government of Pakistan calls upon the government of India to
realise the futility of its efforts to impose a military solution
on Kashmir and join Pakistan in a sincere effort to resolve the
dispute," it said.

India should halt "its repression, violence and terror against the
Kashmiri people, respect the right of the Kashmiri people to self-
determination, (and) respond positively to the Pakistani
initiatives for peace", the statement said.

It asked New Delhi to let a delegation of the All Parties Hurriyat
Conference go to Islamabad for talks with Pakistan "for a peaceful
settlement of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant UN
Security Council resolutions".

Pakistan has responded to the ceasefire by offering "maximum
restraint" along the Line of Control, and withdrawal some of its
troops from the area.

In November it also invited the Hurriyat Conference executive
council for talks in Islamabad.

New Delhi has not opposed the idea but so far it has not issued the
necessary travel documents to the Hurriyat leaders.

A team of US congressmen currently in Pakistan, having visited
India earlier in the week, has also urged India to allow the
Hurriyat leaders to travel to Islamabad.

could develop bilateral ties and promote economic cooperation in

restraint regime was established in South Asia.-Reuters/APP

<a name="paki">Pakistan stresses nuke deterrence</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 23: Pakistan on Friday emphasized that the cause of
peace, security and progress in the conflict-ridden South Asian
region could be best served if mutual deterrence was preserved at
the lowest possible level and the core issue of Kashmir was
addressed.

This was spelt by the Foreign Office Director General, responsible
for disarmament issues at the inaugural session of the three-day
workshop on confidence building measures in South Asia.

The workshop has been organized by the international relations
department of the University of Karachi.

Pakistan remains ready to discuss in fairly specific terms its
requirements for a minimum credible nuclear deterrence, if India
was prepared to do so, the Foreign Office official said in his
written presentation.

Pakistan was also prepared for reciprocal agreements with India for
nuclear and missile restraints. These could include: one, not to
deploy ballistic missiles; two, not to operationally weaponize
nuclear capable missile systems; three, formalize the understanding
to provide prior and adequate notification of flight-tests of
missiles; and four, to declare a moratorium on the development,
acquisition or deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems, since
these can destabilize "minimum credible deterrence."

Nuclear restraint agreements between India and Pakistan could be
accompanied by political and technical confidence building
measures, he said.

South Asia could become a region of peace and progress through a
commitment on the part of both India and Pakistan to resolve the
core Issue of Jammu and Kashmir through peaceful negotiations in
accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.

Pakistan on its part had made persistent efforts to defuse tension
over Kashmir and to launch the process for a just and peaceful
resolution to the dispute, he said. He also referred to the
exercise maximum restraint along the Line of Control in Jammu and
Kashmir, and withdrawal of sizable forces from forward positions on
the Line of Control.

The foreign office official said that the Indian announcement to
suspend military operations against the Kashmiri freedom fighters
would be meaningful only if it was combined with other essential
elements i.e. commencement of a purposeful dialogue for the
settlement of the Kashmir dispute, an end to repression and
violence against the Kashmiri people, reduction of Indian forces in
the occupied Kashmir, release of all detainees and respect for the
fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people.

occupied Kashmir, release of all detainees and respect for the
fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people.

He also reiterated Pakistan's proposal that the executive committee
of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, the representative of the
Kashmiri people should be allowed to travel to Pakistan preparatory
to a tripartite dialogue. Conciliation cannot be brought about nor
confidence created unilaterally, he said.

The road map to this end lies through the peaceful methods of
settlement of disputes such as bilateral negotiations as well as
resorting to the good offices and mediation as provided in the
charter of the United Nations, he added.

<a name="rest">Restoration of assemblies in March likely</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Feb 21: There is a strong indication of restoration of
parliament in the last week of March, reliable sources told NNI
here on Wednesday. The chief executive, Gen Pervez Musharraf, would
assume as president whereas anyone from Mian Azhar or Ejazul Haq
would be nominated as prime minister following the restoration of
assemblies, sources disclosed.

Though eight political parties, including Pakistan Muslim League,
have supported the government option to restore the assemblies,
some PML "hardliners" are opposing the move.

The Pakistan People's Party supports fresh elections, however, some
leaders of the party are also against the restoration of assemblies
and are calling for fresh elections.

According to these sources, Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Awami
National Party (ANP), Balochistan National Party (BNP), Jamhoori
Watan Party (JWP), Jamiat Ulema-I-Islam (JUI) and National Peoples
Party (NPP) including independent members of FATA and minorities,
have decided to support the move besides eight other parties.

The option to restore the assemblies was considered at the meetings
between the PML central leaders, Mian Azhar and Chaudhry Shujaat
Hussain, and Gen Musharraf.

However, they were assigned some tasks to accomplish. One of the
tasks has been accomplished following the election of Chaudhry
Pervez Ellahi as PML Punjab President, the sources disclosed.

In the second stage, preparations to hold party elections in Sindh
have been finalized. Maqbool Shaikh and Ghaus Bakhsh Mehr are two
main contenders for the Pakistan Muslim League's provincial
presidentship.

Work is in hand in wooing 35 PML suspended members of the National
Assembly, who are considered to be "hardliners". They have also
assured their cooperation in the wake of restoration of assemblies
and would subsequently quit the Nawaz Sharif camp. Until then, they
want to remain spectators, the sources further confided.

The Awami National Party and the Balochistan National Party leaders
have also shown interest and support for restoration of assemblies.
They have recently held detailed talks with PML senior vice
president Ejazul Haq on the option.

In the NWFP, Saleem Saifullah Khan is expected to be the candidate
for the provincial presidentship. He has also assured cooperation
if the government restores the assemblies.

The sources said that the eighth constitutional amendment would be
restored in the wake of the restoration of the assemblies.-NNI

Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Feb 19: Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi was elected unopposed
president of the Punjab PML by 793, out of 911, members of the
provincial general council on Monday, splitting the party into two
factions.

Rival faction, led by Sardar Zulfikar Khosa, immediately rejected
the whole exercise as illegal, saying most of the participants had
come either under pressure and threats from intelligence agencies
or they were workers in factories of Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi,
speaker of the suspended provincial assembly, and Humayun Akhtar
Khan.

Wasim Sajjad, chairman of the suspended senate, and Illahi Bakhsh
Soomro, speaker of the suspended National Assembly, attended the
meeting at the Muslim League House as observers.

They refused to offer comments on the genuineness of the exercise.

They told reporters that they would present their points of view
before the conciliation committee, which was constituted to discuss
the possibility of restoring the membership of four party leaders,
expelled for breach of discipline.

They both did not reply when a reporter asked whether Chaudhry
Pervaiz Elahi, whose basic membership was under suspension with 26
others, was eligible to contest election for the presidentship.

Independent group leaders Qaiser Sheikh, Nasrullah Dreshak, Asghar
Khan and Jamaat-i-Islami's Liaquat Baloch also witnessed the
proceedings as observers.

Through a resolution, the new president was empowered to appoint
other office-bearers or bring about changes in the organizational
structure.

The meeting was requisitioned by 768 members to elect president as
the post had been lying vacant for long.

Chaudhry Shujaat told reporters that of the participants 161 were
suspended MPAs and 51 MNAs. He said many others could not
participate because they were out of the country.

Senior leader Mian Meraj Din, who recently became acting provincial
president, presided over the meeting.

Separate registration stalls had been set up outside the Muslim
League House for every division where members were issued identity
cards. Almost all participants entered the premises with ID cards
and those who did not have them, were provided with the same
immediately.

There were many who had been ministers in the cabinets of either
Nawaz Sharif or Shahbaz Sharif. They have been diehard supporters
of the Sharifs and nobody could expect that they would change their
loyalties so conveniently.

<a name="russ">Russia offers help to Pakistan Steel</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Habib Khan Ghori

KARACHI, Feb 23: Russian Ambassador Eduard S. Shevchenko has
offered support for the modernization of some plants of the
Pakistan Steel, enabling it to increase its production to three
million tons.

Speaking at the Centre for Development of Democracy on Friday, he
said that if Russia stopped selling weapons to India, it could buy
them from France, Britain, US and other countries, adding that
Russia was ready to sell weapons to Pakistan as well.

Mr Shevchenko said that despite Russia's offer Pakistan had not
approached his government for the purchase of weapons.

He said that the Taliban-sponsored militancy in Afghanistan and
Pakistan's expression of support to rebels in Chechnya had shadowed
"our bilateral relations". He added that on this issue his
president had spoken to the chief executive.

The ambassador ruled out Russian mediation for the resolution of
disputes between India and Pakistan.

"We support the settlement of the disputes but they can be resolved
only when you come in touch with India," he said.

"We are eager to have friendly relations with Pakistan - just as we
have friendly relations with China and India."

About the government of the Taliban in Afghanistan, he said: "Even
China has criticized the Taliban's policy of supporting
international terrorism by setting up training camps from where
armed groups are being sent to neighbouring countries."

The Russian ambassador said: "Drug supply from Afghanistan is a
problem not only for Russia but also for Pakistan where the number
of drug addicts is estimated to be four million."

He said Pakistan and Russia shared views on a number of issues,
such as the multipolar world and bilateral relations in the
economic sector.

<a name="sind">Punjab-Sindh stand-off on water continues</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: The inter-provincial dispute on water sharing
during shortages remained unresolved as the Indus River System
Authority (Irsa) on Thursday failed to find a solution acceptable
to Punjab and Sindh.

Provincial members at the authority agreed to meet on March 17 for
holding further deliberations on the issue before taking a final
decision, Secretary Irsa, Sohail Alam, told a news conference after
the meeting.

Meanwhile, the provincial representatives, particularly of Punjab
and Sindh, would consult their respective governments whether they
could show any flexibility "in the larger interest of the country,"
Mr Alam said.

Irsa in its meeting also appraised various options including the
one of referring the issue back to the CE with the observation of
all the four provinces and a request to consult the apex court.

The option of invoking clause 8(2) of the Irsa Act for holding a
ballot on the issue is still open and can be exercised if pressed
by Sindh, he said.

"Sindh has not pressed for the balloting otherwise the authority
would have to invoke clause 8(2)," Mr Alam added.

The authority today traced the history of the problem and concluded
that there were a lot of "grey areas", which needed further
explanations from the provincial governments.

"Provincial members will seek guidance from their respective
governments on these grey areas," he said.

<a name="fore">Foreign Office slams Nuclear fuel supply to India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Feb 20: Expressing concern over the reported shipment of
nuclear fuel to India by Russia, Pakistan on Tuesday criticized the
discriminatory treatment of the Nuclear Material Suppliers Club
against Islamabad
, even for the supply of maintenance material for power reactors
operating under safeguards of the International Atomic Energy
Agency.

Foreign Office spokesman Riaz M. Khan was commenting on the nuclear
fuel supply for India's Tarapore nuclear reactor which is not
safeguarded by the IAEA.

He said that the Russian shipment would help the growth of the
Indian nuclear weapon capability in contrast to the very tight
restrictions for supply of any nuclear equipment to Pakistan,
though needed specifically for peaceful purposes or related to the
safety of its nuclear installations which were under the IAEA
safeguards.

The spokesman asserted that the shipment, which followed the
Russian agreements for large-scale supply of military equipment,
including Sukhoi SU-30 and T-90 tanks, to India, would widen the
conventional arms imbalance in the region and would not be helpful
for peace and stability.

The spokesman said the "myth of ceasefire" in occupied Kashmir,
which had carried little credibility, had been demolished by the
admission of the Indian military commander that the Indian military
had fired on peaceful protesters in Haigam and Maisuma recently,
resulting in scores of casualties.

The spokesman denied as "completely unfounded and baseless" that
Islamabad was obstructing United Nations officials from crossing
the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Pakistan itself, he said, had desired the UN to arrange relief and
assistance for the Afghan people inside that country and added that

<a name="pcto">PC told to privatize PTCL by June</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Feb 20: The cabinet committee on privatization on
Tuesday approved the reference price of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas
business of the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines.

Sources said the CCOP approved the same reference price which had
been okayed by the SNGPL's board of directors. Earlier, the board
had rejected the highest bid offered by M/s Petroson of Singapore.

The meeting decided that the new bidder would not be offered any
particular quota of the product. The bidder would be told to sell
the product on the market-based prices by further developing its
own infrastructure.

Presided over by Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz, the committee also
approved exclusion of sale of Pakistan State Oil shares in the
Pakistan Refinery from the short-term privatization programme.

 Mr Aziz directed the Privatization Commission (PC) to make sure
that the PTCL was disinvested by June. The government was
anticipating to earn $1 billion by disinvesting majority shares of
the PTCL, sources said.

The meeting also discussed the privtization of the Karachi
Electricity Supply Company within this year for which the ADB has
committed $150m for restructuring the KESC.

The meeting was informed that the efforts to privatize HBL and the
UBL had also been accelerated. The government had injected Rs18bn
into these banks to cover up their financial loss.

The meeting was informed that the PC had paid about Rs5 billion
under the golden handshake scheme and voluntary separation scheme
for the privatization of a number of industrial units which had
been either privatized or closed down for privatization.

<a name="tape">Tapes be added to Supreme Court record: Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Feb 20: PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto on Tuesday
requested the Supreme Court to direct the federation to bring the
tapes and transcripts of conversation between Justice Qayyum and
Saifur Rehman on the court's record.

In an application, Ms Bhutto stated that the publication of taped
conversation by The Sunday Times had proved that her trial was mala
fide and biased. Ms Bhutto, whose appeal against her conviction
would be taken up next week, said she was denied the opportunity of
due process of law and that, on merit, there was no case against
her.

In another application, she submitted the legal opinion of
prominent jurists of the world with regard to her conviction.

The PPP leader pointed out that tapes had revealed conversation in
connection with her case among then law minister Khalid Anwar,
Saifur Rehman, former head of the Ehtesab Bureau; Justice Malik
Qayyum and Justice Rashid Aziz Khan, former chief justice of the
Lahore high Court.

The tapes revealed a deep-rooted conspiracy between senior
functionaries of the Nawaz Sharif government, the trial court judge
and the then chief justice of the LHC to convict and sentence her
at all costs and as quickly as possible without having regard to
the merits of the case, she said.

The trial court judge, she said, was pressured not only by the then
chief justice of the LHC but also by Khalid Anwar and Saifur Rehman
at the behest of the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif.

Ms Bhutto stated she did not know whether the persons whose voices
were audible in the tapes, had denied that the events, as recorded,
did not transpire or initiated legal action against the newspaper.

<a name="expa">Expatriates send $667.5m in seven months</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Feb 22: The foreign exchange sent by overseas Pakistanis
rose to $667.5 million in the first seven months of the current
fiscal year from $549.3 million in a year-ago period.

The State Bank statistics show an increase of 20 per cent in home
remittances from various countries, including the United States,
between July-January 2000-01 as compared to the remittances
received in July-January 1999-00.

Home remittances from Kuwait jumped to $106.8 million from $68
million chiefly because of compensation paid by Kuwait to Pakistani
Gulf War affectees.

But the increase of $38.8 million is a little over one third of the
$118.2 million rise in total home remittances of the first seven
months of the fiscal 2000-01. That is there has been a rather
general upward trend in inflow of foreign exchange through home
remittances.

Bankers say what has helped them attract more foreign exchange
through home remittances is a progressive improvement in delivery
of the amount sent back home. The state-run as well as the private
banks claim they have cut the time taken in the delivery of
remittances to 24 hours in the cities and 48 hours in the rural
areas. But this claim is hard to digest given the common complaints
about delay in the delivery of remittances.

The statistics show the largest amount of remittances ($189
million) came in from Saudi Arabia followed by the United Arab
Emirates ($137 million) and Kuwait ($106.8 million) during the
period under review. In the same period of fiscal 1999-2000 home
remittances from Saudi Arabia were slightly higher at $190 million;
followed by $98.8 million from UAE and $68 million from Kuwait.

In the first seven months of the current fiscal year remittances
from the USA and Dubai have risen significantly compared to the
same period of last fiscal year. Remittances from the US rose from
$44.8 million in July-January 1999-2000 to $74 million in July-
January 2000-01 and those from Dubai went up from $58 million to
$95 million.

Remittances from the UK also increased from about $44 million to
about $49 million. Overseas Pakistanis based in Canada, Norway and
Abu Dhabi also sent back home slightly higher amounts of foreign
exchange in the first seven months of this fiscal year than they
had remitted in the same period of last fiscal year.

And those based in Japan doubled the home remittances-from $0.9
million to $1.98 million.

Home remittances averaging around a billion dollars per year are
the second biggest source of foreign exchange earnings for Pakistan
after exports.

Bankers and financial analysts say home remittances can be
increased manifold to help the country meet its foreign exchange
liabilities. But the authorities have so far failed to do this.

Senior bankers estimate that overseas Pakistanis send back home $8-
$10 billion every year of which only $1 billion or so comes through
banking channel and the rest through Hundi. They say the share of
official remittances can be raised significantly by reducing the
difference between interbank and kerb market exchange rates and by
offering some incentives to those remitting money through banks.

<a name="task">Task force reports submitted to govt: CBR working</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Feb 23: Task Force on Tax Administration has finalized
its recommendations, which called for adopting universal self-
assessment system, punitive penalties and prosecution as deterrence
against tax evasion in Pakistan.

 A study conducted by Lahore University of Management Sciences
(LUMS) on behalf of the Task Force on Tax Administration on Income
Tax recommended the government to have a strong audit capacity,
selective audit, a centralized information system intelligence,
vigilant efforts, tax payers education and assistance programme to
not only remove corruption from the system, but also increase
revenues of the country.

"We have submitted all reports to the government to extensively
improve the functioning of the CBR with a view to stop mounting
corruption from the organization", said the task force chairman
Syed Shahid Hussain.

 He told this correspondent on the telephone from Washington that
all the consultants hired by his task force were the people of
great integrity and were the experts of their fields, who have done
their jobs to the utmost satisfaction of the concerned officials.

"Now this is upto the government to implement our various reports
to achieve the objectives of increasing revenues and plugging the
leakages", he added.

The report foresees possible abuse of the system of selective audit
and the possibility of revenue haemorrhage in the short term. This
problem will be less serious once the department develops the
credibility of being tough on tax evasion and fraud by pursing
these cases in civil and criminal courts. The department has to
build this credibility over the next 3-5 years. During the pilot
phase of the proposed plan, the revenue haemorrhage issue can be
addressed by closely monitoring those tax payers, who are major
contributors to tax revenue and selecting those for detailed audit
who show large variation from historical income and profit figure.

<a name="hund">Hundreds of CBR officials reinstated</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Feb 23: The government on Friday reinstated hundreds of
tax officials who had been suspended on charges of "corruption and
irregularities".

The officials, who were sacked by the Central Board of Revenue,
were given relief by the courts.

The CBR on Nov 25, 2000 had suspended 1,040 officials on charges of
corruption and irregularities.

Applications of hundreds of tax officials have already been
accepted by the courts and they have been issued stay order against
their suspension. Cases of several others are still pending
decision.

Today the CBR issued a notification accepting all employees whose
services have been restored by the courts.

The notification said that though the services of the officials are
being reinstated, "this is, however, subject to the final judgment
of the High Court and/or Supreme Court of Pakistan on the CPSLA
filed by the CBR, whichever is earlier".

The order to suspend these employees was issued with the approval
of Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf. However, neither these
officials were charge-sheeted nor any disciplinary proceedings were
initiated against them due to lack of concrete evidence.

The government has now brought several amendments in rules
governing Civil Servants' Services to get rid of "corrupt"
officers.

<a name="defe">Defence budget being reduced: Shaukat</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Jamal

LAHORE, Feb 17: Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said on Saturday that
Pakistan's defence spending had been brought down to 4.70 per cent
of the GDP from over eight per cent during the past several years.

The minister, who was speaking at a seminar organized here by the
Young Presidents Organization (YPO) on opportunities in Pakistan,
said country's defence budget constituted 20 per cent of its annual
budget.

"We are bringing it (the defence spending) down," Aziz said in
response to a question from a US businessman who quoted a report
from a magazine that Pakistan was spending 30 per cent of its GNP
to maintain its military might that left little for social sector
and human development.

Aziz said the (military) government was re-deploying resources to
reduce poverty and human development by raising spending on social
sector including education and healthcare. However, he said, the
effort required assistance from "friends and donors".

To another question again from another American businessman, the
minister claimed that he did not see a "massive change in exchange
rate in the next five years". But he did not rule out "exchange
rate adjustments". He said exchange rate was related to inflation.
"Though you will find (local) people complaining of high inflation,
we are still at the low end of the spectrum if seen in the context
of several other regional nations," he claimed. He forecast under
five per cent differential in the inflation rates in the US and
Pakistan.

Some 160 foreign businessmen, who are members of the YPO, from
several countries including the US, India and Saudi Arabia are
visiting the Punjab capital these days. This is the first time YPO
has brought its members in the country. Their visit coincides with
the festival of Basant. Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf is
expected to fete them during his two-day stay in the city.

Commerce Minister Abdul Razzak Dawood and Privatization Minister
Altaf Saleem were also on the panel that briefed the participants
about the government policies and effort to improve the investment
and business climate in the country.

Though journalists had been invited to cover the seminar by the
Pakistan Information Department, they had to sneak into the hall.

Aziz told the audience that the government was planning to publish
a 10-year economic road-map for investors. He said 50 per cent of
the budget went to debt servicing, adding a debt reduction strategy
had already been formulated and approved by the cabinet and that it
would soon be made public. He said structural reforms and debt
reduction were critical to formation and implementation of sound
economic policies. He said debt reduction required an increase in
exports, formulation of sound fiscal policies and improved quality
of governance.

The minister forecast close to four per cent growth rate for the
current fiscal year which could improve slightly should the country
get good rains. He was hopeful that Pakistan would be able to
achieve a growth rate in the range of 5-6 per cent in three years
which was good enough to fight poverty. He said the growth target
was not difficult to achieve in view of the historic rate of six
per cent. He said it was only during the 1990s that the growth rate
had come down.

Replying a question from an Indian participant on trade between the
two countries, Aziz said South Asia was the only region in the
world where no economic block had been formed. He said (nations in
the) other parts of the world had resolved all issues that impeded
economic collaboration between them. Without naming Kashmir, he
said Pakistan was open to talks for resolution of all fundamental
issues with India in the national interests of both the countries.

<a name="cbrt">CBR to scan 53,300 import accounts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

 ISLAMABAD, Feb 23: Tax authorities have decided to scan import
accounts of 53,300 businessmen for detecting tax evasion allegedly
committed by them during the current financial year.

The step is being taken by the Central Board of Revenue after
finding out that 53,300 out of 92,800 manufacturers and traders
registered with the sales tax department (57.4 per cent) have not
paid a penny to the national exchequer, over the past seven months
of the current fiscal year.

This leaves the taxpayer compliance at 42.6 per cent, which is the
lowest performance after the issuance of Sales Tax Act, 1990,
sources said.

 Scrutiny of bank accounts of these taxpayers is also under
consideration if import accounts did not help in detecting their
turnovers and the amount of evasion committed.

 Of these listed tax evaders, 28,160 are those who have stopped
paying the tax from the current financial year though they have
filed the tax returns. There are 25,157 others who are neither
paying anything in taxes nor are they filing tax returns.

Failure of the sales tax audit department to detect the evasion has
mainly led the CBR to take this drastic step, say sources. The
audit department scanned ledgers of only 3,100 such listed persons
and detected evasion of Rs4.5 billion, out of which only Rs925
million have been recovered during the current financial year.

The sales tax department has already made attempts to locate those
of the listed tax evaders, whose addresses have changed over the
past one year, but with no success, as more than 90 percent are not
traceable.

The Customs department is now being asked to furnish details of
imports of machinery, equipments, parts and raw materials plus
finished goods imported by these persons. If they are doing
business while remaining untraceable, the department would be
approaching them with notices for not filing tax returns and for
recovery of the unpaid amounts.

Sources further revealed that the July-December 2000 compliance
appraisal of the sales tax department by the IMF experts has
resulted in a serious warning to the CBR that it would lead to
refusal of the Fund to release the next tranche from the Stand By
Arrangement if the situation did not improve.

The number of registered persons short-filing the tax has also
risen to 340. These taxpayers have paid only 10-40 per cent of the
due amounts of tax, applying the trick of assessing tax rate below
the stipulated 15 per cent.

The IMF experts have also been expressing concern regarding the
poor audit system of Pakistan which leaves 99 per cent of the
taxpayers un-audited and hence encouraging tax evasion. The minimum
audit slab determined by IMF is 25 per cent whereas the Pakistani
sales tax department is able to scan ledgers of below one per cent
of the registered taxpayers.

<a name="bank">Banks borrow Rs2.9bn from State Bank</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 23: Banks had to borrow Rs2.9 billion overnight funds
from the State Bank on Friday to square their liquidity positions.

Friday being the last day for averaging out the weekly cash
reserves normally witnesses heavy borrowing or huge lending-as the
case may be-by the banks.

That was why the inflow of more than Rs15 billion on Thursday was
offset on Friday because of heavy borrowing by the banks that were
short in their cash reserves.

 Banks are supposed to keep weekly cash reserves worth five per
cent of their total deposits but they are allowed to let the
reserves fall to four per cent on any day.

Since the money market remained short of fund for several days
before an inflow of over Rs15 billion on Thursday most banks had
kept themselves short in cash reserves until Friday.

<a name="mull">CBR mulling new tax refund plan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: A new export tax refund procedure for preventing
refund frauds and simplifying the payment mechanism is being
processed by the Central Board of Revenue.

The CBR sources informed Dawn on Thursday that the new system (Fast
Track Refund Clearance Procedure) aimed at zero-taxing the business
activity and reducing the cost of refunds.

 The main purpose of the exercise is to boost exports by doing away
the cost of compliance on the part of export manufacturers.

This compliance cost is entailed in the production of various
documents for proving the validity of claim and the authenticity of
inputs used on the basis of which the refunds are admissible.

A strong audit is being launched for the fast track export refund
clearance under the new system, which for the exporters with poor
compliance track record, would be bringing pre-fraud checks and
assessment of a claim before sanctioning.

The exporters with good compliance record would be rewarded under a
method of export-profiling currently in use and is intended to be
made more effective.

The new system would take care of frauds associated with the refund
process on the basis of fake (flying) input purchase invoices and
the practice of issuing double invoices.

Under the existing system the tax administration has to involve in
unnecessary vigilance activity, which creates distortions in the
tax regime.

To remove such distortions, the CBR has been advised to give up the
policy of retaining Rs4-5 billion accumulated amount per month from
the refunds claimed by exporters.

<a name="talk">Talks with IMF mission satisfactory: Shaukat</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 22: Minister for Finance Shaukat Aziz said here on
Thursday that talks with the visiting IMF review mission had proved
to be "very good" to qualify for the next 130-million- dollar
tranche due in March this year.

"Our talks had been very good with the IMF as both sides achieved
an agreement on major issues," he further stated. Both sides, he
claimed, were fully satisfied with the level of negotiations.

Briefing reporters here on Thursday, he said that talks with the
IMF would be finalised on Friday after which the officials would go
back to Washington to propose to their executive board to disburse
the next tranche.

"This is absolutely untrue that the Fund has expressed any no-
confidence in the policies of the present government," Aziz said
adding that he was very much pleased with the outcome of
negotiations with the IMF.

He said that Pakistan had already been offered the first tranche of
196 million dollars, out of the 596 million dollars Standby
Arrangement (SBA).

The finance minister said that Pakistan would be offered three more
instalments in March, June and September 2001.

Responding to a question he said that the Fund officials were
reasonable people and did not demand that Pakistan must achieve its
annual targets despite the poor performance of the agricultural
sector as a consequence of delayed rains.

"They understand that under the present circumstances we can not
achieve our growth targets". He said that the IMF was taking the
"macro view" of the situation that was helping the government.

He said that revenue targets could be readjusted in case there were
more revenue shortfalls.

BAGHDAD, Feb 21: Pakistani delegation has struck various deals
worth more than $35.5 million with Iraqi authorities during three-
day visit to Baghdad.

This was stated by state Minister and Chairman Export Promotion
Bureau (EPB) Tariq Ikrim here on Wednesday.

He said the visit was very fruitful and Pakistan is likely to get
more orders worth millions of dollars for the supply of various
consumers and construction work, medicines, surgical items,
laboratory equipment, stationary items, agricultural implements,
spare parts, tractors.

Tariq Ikram said there had been a total change in the attitude of
Iraqi government following Pakistan's support of Iraqi stand and
strong condemnation of US-UK air strikes over Baghdad.

He said Pakistan struck deal for the supply of 100,000 metric tons
of wheat worth $12 million, 40,000 tons rice worth $10 million,
wooden doors for $11 million and G I Pipes worth $2.5 million
during the current visit to Iraq.

"We have negotiated various other opportunities with Iraqi
authorities in the field of education, agriculture, housing, trade
and other areas. These opportunities will be capitalised soon", EPB
Chairman said.

He pointed out that on Wednesday, negotiations were held with Iraqi
Housing Minister Dr Ma'an Sarsam for the construction of 500,000
tons low-cost houses in Iraq.

He said this is a major tender, expected to involve more than $2.5
billion over the five years. "Pakistani construction companies and
architect will come to Iraq soon to evaluate the tender which has
the closing date in the middle of March", State Minister said.

He said Iraqis have also expressed interest in utilizing computer

<a name="nwfp">NWFP investment plan fails to take off</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Intikhab Amir

PESHAWAR, Feb 21: The NWFP government has failed to materialize its
2000-01 financial year's investment plan, due to paucity of funds,
official sources told Dawn on Wednesday.

"Over seven months of the fiscal have passed and the NWFP
government's investment plan could not take off," a provincial
government official said, requesting anonymity.

According to sources, the provincial government had planned to
invest some Rs800m in different profit schemes during the 2000- 01.

However, persistent financial constraints, faced to the provincial
kitty right from the start of the fiscal, did not let the financial
planners of the province to materialize their envisaged move.

Investment was to be made from the provincial government's account
No 1, which receives cash flows from the direct federal transfers
made to the province every month from its share under the federal
divisible pool (FDP).

Reduced payments made to the province from the FDP and huge
shortfall recorded in the provincial own receipts, during the first
seven months of the fiscal, said the sources, incapacitated the
provincial kitty to an extent that the government had hardly been
able to pay monthly salaries to its employees besides meeting daily
administrative expenses.

After satisfying its hard-to-ignore monetary obligations, including
monthly salary bill and other vital establishment charges, the
provincial government had around Rs300m cash balance, in mid
February, in its account No 1, maintained with the State Bank of
Pakistan.

Last year too, the provincial government could not materialize its
investment plan to the fullest, forcing the province to lose the
amount, it had envisaged to raise from the interest.

This year again, the delay to invest the envisaged amount left
negative impact on the provincial resources and the province would
not raise the funds equal to the sum, it anticipated to receive
from interest on the investment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Feb 20: The European Commission (EC), one of the
potential donors of Rs500 billion Social Action Programme, has
expressed its concern over the uncertain future of the programme
and sought firm commitments
 from Islamabad before releasing funds for its execution.

The EC, which has blocked its share of funds for SAP due to
political reasons, has told Pakistan that though it gives
importance to SAP in its overall economic assistance strategy, "it
is concerned about its future".

The EC expressed its apprehensions about the programme during a
recent meeting with Pakistan mission in Brussels and sought details
from Islamabad.

Pakistan mission, a source said, has informed the government that
they have initiated a process of regular consultation with the EC
to get the funds released.

The first meeting with the EC, it told the government, was held
recently, in which the Commission emphasized the importance of SAP
in the overall economic assistance strategy for Pakistan.

The EC side told the mission that it attached great importance to
SAP but wondered whether this programme was being accorded "as much
priority and national commitment by the military government as it
deserves".

The European Commission has also expressed its serious concern over
the low funding for the development of the social sectors by
Islamabad.

The source said that the Pakistani mission also raised the issue of
blocked disbursements because of upfront committed investment not
having been made. It was pointed out that the government of
Pakistan was fully committed to the programme and attached great
importance to improvements in literacy, education and basic health
services.

The EC was informed that the government was presently undertaking
an indepth review of the programme to restructure its priorities in
the light of its performance todate and also to provide a better
interface with the ongoing devolution of power programme.

The Commission was told that government had also decided that new
local government's institutions would play a key role in the future
implementation and financing of the programme.

The Pakistan mission, the source said, also admitted that SAP was
not being provided enough funding but this was a result of an
overall squeeze in the public sector outlays and not because of a
shift in government's priorities.

Sources said the two sides also agreed that the issue of
disbursement problem would be addressed in the mid-term review of
the programme, which is due soon.

Meanwhile, subsequent to this meeting with the European Commission,
the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) has sought certain information
on SAP-related issues from the Planning Commission for their onward
transmission to EC, sources said.

<a name="rupe">Rupee falls to 63.10 per $ in kerb</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Feb 20: The rupee on Tuesday hit a lifetime low, below 60
to a US dollar, in the inter-bank market after struggling hard for
a few days to hold firm. In kerb market also, it slipped under 63
to a dollar on continued buying of greenbacks
by speculators anticipating further fall in the rupee value.

In the inter-bank market, the rupee closed at 60.16/60.20 to a US
dollar on Tuesday showing an overnight fall of 40 paisa against the
Monday close of 59.76/59.80 to a dollar. And in kerb, it finished
at 63.05/63.10 per dollar registering an overnight loss of 50 paisa
against the previous close of 62.55/62.60.

Bankers said the State Bank saw the rupee fall from 59.80 on Monday
to an intra-day low of 60.30 on Tuesday, but did not intervene.
They said the rupee recovered modestly after Habib Bank and
Citibank sold a few million dollars in the market: it closed at
60.16/60.20 to a dollar at the end of the day.

Pakistan's net cash foreign exchange reserves are slightly over
half a billion dollars at the moment. The low level of reserves
makes it difficult for the State Bank to defend the rupee in the
inter- bank market by selling dollars. What else makes more
difficult is the IMF condition that the country should not be a net
seller in the market.

Bankers said the local currency fell sharply on heavy demand for
dollars by some corporates including Dewan Salman group. The group
bought at least $16 million in a few month forward deals.

The rupee that began falling last week has so far lost 1.6 per cent
of its value against the dollar in the inter-bank market. In the
kerb market, it has shed 85 paisa or more than 1.3 per cent against
the dollar in less than one week. Currency dealers said the rupee
closed at 63.05/63.10 to a dollar for spot buying and selling on
Tuesday.

President of Forex Association of Pakistan Malik Bostan said
speculators were out buying dollars for profit making. "The fall of
the rupee in the inter-bank market has prompted heavy buying in the
open market," he said when reached by Dawn over the telephone.

Some currency dealers, who declined to be identified, said the
State Bank buying of dollars continued side by side. Normally, the
SBP suspends dollar buying from kerb, when the rupee is on the
slide. No senior SBP official was ready to say anything on this
subject. In the first six months of this fiscal year, the SBP
bought more than $750 million from the open market. How much it
bought in January and February this year is not known.

The rupee came under pressure both in the inter-bank market as well
as in the kerb late last week amidst reports that the IMF wants the
SBP to stop - or at least reduce - financing of oil import bills on
its own and pass it on to the market. Bankers said SBP has so far
not indicated if it would do this.

Bankers say the IMF demand for further opening up of foreign
exchange market has also led importers in the past one week or so
to make quick buyings of dollars. And it encouraged exporters to
get slower in selling their export proceeds.

Led by Assistant Director for Middle Eastern Department Ms Sena
Ekin, an IMF review mission is currently in Pakistan to assess its
performance in the light of the criteria set by the IMF under a
$596 million standby credit. Pakistan got $192 million worth of
first tranche out of this loan on November 30, 2000. The release of
the second tranche is subject to a favourable report by the review
mission and subsequent endorsement by the IMF board of directors.

MEHMOODKOT, Feb 18: Pak Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO) will issue an
international tender for the export of surplus petrol following
dilly-dallying by Iran on prices. This was stated by managing
director, PARCO, Dr Shahid K. Haq at a press briefing
 at the refinery here on Sunday.

"We will issue an international tender as Iran has offered very low
price for our petrol", he said without giving any details as to
when the company will invite the international tender.

A PARCO official told reporters that the refinery has to invite
international tender very urgently due to annual surplus of 400,000
to 500,000 tons of petrol following commissioning of the refinery.

"We have the capacity to produce 1,500 tons per day but we have
slashed the production to 1,000 tons", he said.

The official said the government has also asked PARCO to cut the
production of petrol by 25-30 per cent. The government has also
asked other refineries to cut their production of petrol also.

The main bottleneck in exporting surplus petrol is the lack of
storage capacity for petrol in PARCO.

"We are holding negotiations with National Refinery Limited (NRL)
and Caltex to provide us storage facilities so that additional
production could be exported immediately", the official said.

'<a name="thef">The first observation'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

"The first observation that I would like to make is this: you will
no doubt agree with me that the first duty of a government is to
maintain law and order, so that the life, property and religious
beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the state."

Such was the first dictum of the founder of this country delivered
during his address of August 11, 1947, to the first constituent
assembly of Pakistan. This 'first duty' has never been fulfilled,
this country has never been run under either law or order, nor have
we had an independent judiciary able to enforce both, nor a junta
nor a parliament, nor an administration slightly interested in
doing so. All that has been achieved is the loss of half the
country within the space of 25 years of its life - a loss about
which we are still arguing and speculating. What is now left to us
seems, as things are at this point in time, to be doomed.

Another set of tapes has suddenly emerged, produced by yet another
set of spooks. These were sent to The Sunday Times (London) which
published an article on February 4 on the judicial system of our
country, reproducing transcripts of the tapes. Yesterday, February
17, an NNI report had it that "the PPP International Secretariat
has applied to The Sunday Times to get a copy of the said tapes so
that they may be placed before the Supreme Court when it takes up
the appeal of former premier Benazir Bhutto seeking an honourable
acquittal from her conviction later this month, said a PPP press
release......"

What seems odd about this is that on December, 27, 2000, a Karachi
English daily carried an NNI story headed: 'Benazir may return with
tapes to overturn trial: report'. This report told us that: "A
long-time confidant of PPP chairperson and former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto in London, Bashir Riaz, told the Indian daily [The
Hindustan Times] "The PPP has a tape containing conversations
between Saifur Rahman, chief of accountability bureau and close
confident of Nawaz Sharif, and several judges which would make the
whole trial and Bibi's conviction a farce. Bashir Riaz claimed to
have the said tape in his possession."

On December 31, 2000, a PPI report in the same daily confirmed that
the PPP had the tapes: "....Riaz said that the PPP wanted to take
immediate steps to clear Benazir's name. He said that the party had
new evidence that proved the Nawaz government had pressured the
judiciary to convict Benazir. 'We've got excellent tape
recordings,' he added."

Now, if the PPP had the tapes in December, presumably the same
tapes sent to The Sunday Times in February, how come the PPP is now
making noises about asking The Sunday Times to let them have a copy
of the tapes when they themselves are the providers of the tapes?
This makes no sense.

Is it a question of selective amnesia or an obsessive disregard of
facts?

On February 16, a Dawn Islamabad Bureau report from Attock Fort
headed "Asif ready to pay 90 per cent property in 'his name'." It
read: "Asif Zardari, jailed husband of former prime minister Ms
Benazir Bhutto, said on Thursday that he was ready to hand over all
his properties to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) if only
10 per cent of those properties which NAB claims are worth $ 1.5
billion is given to him."

Presumably husband Asif is referring to is the $ 1.5 billion worth
of assets listed in an Islamabad daily of February 7. These covert
accounts were:

USA - Lapworth Investment Inc; Intrafood Inc; Dynatel Trading
Company; A. S. Reality Inc; Bon Voyage Travel Consultants Inc;

British Virgin Islands - Bomer Finance Inc; Mariston Securities
Inc; Marleton Business S.A.; Capricorn Trading S.A.; Dargal
Associated S.A.; Pagarita Consulting Inc; Marvil Associated Inc;
Penbury Finance Ltd; Oxton Trading Ltd; Brinslen Invest S.A.;
Climitex Holding S.A.; Elkins Holding S.A.; Minterier Invest
Limited (Asif is a true joker - this is his short form for our
interior ministry); Silver Nut Investments Inc; Tacolen Investment
Ltd; Tulcroton Invest S.A.; Marledon Invest S.A.; Dustan Trading
Inc; Reconstruction and Development Finance Inc; Nasseem Alexander
Inc. (Some of these names are also included in the US Senate
Committee Report, details of which were printed in this column last
Sunday.)

Enumerating these accounts, according to the Islamabad daily:
"Based on available data, the total value of the located assets
amount to $ 1.5 billion approximately, as estimated." Also listed
are various other real estate properties owned by Benasif & Co in
UK, France and the US.

Asif's generous offer is reminiscent of the statement made on the
floor of the Senate at the end of 1997 by the then law minister,
Khalid Anwer. Following a discovery of the celebrated bank accounts
in Switzerland, Khalid noted that Benazir had denied that the dummy
companies in whose names the money was lying were beneficially
owned by her or by her husband. He suggested a simple solution to
resolve the entire controversy once and for all. All Benazir and
Asif had to do was to write a one sentence letter to the Swiss
banks stating that they had no objection if the money lying there
was transferred to the Government of Pakistan. If they were not the
beneficial owners, the banks would disregard their statement, but
if they were, the money would be transferred to our government.
That would have ended the matter.

On the subject of matters of public interest, not minor by any
means, such as the desecration of the people's parks and open
spaces, the people may be interested to know how our conscientious
judiciary deals with public interest cases filed in our courts in
which politicians are involved. Take the case of the infamous Costa
Livina under construction in the Bagh-e-Ibne-Qasim (Clifton Park).

In 1972, Kehkashan Scheme 5 (Clifton) was illegally amended to
include an observation tower with a revolving restaurant atop it to
be built within the people's park. Our political vultures had an
interest in the desecration of the 132 acres of open space
demarcated for the use and pleasure of the public. In 1976, this
tower plot (ST-15 Block 3) was allotted to Marvi Investments
ostensibly for the construction of the tower. In April 1990, this
amenity plot was illegally converted into a commercial plot and
within a month the ownership was transferred to Asif-cronies Pearl
Builders, Dr Zulfikar Mirza & Co. Within two months, the KBCA
approved a plan for the construction of a 17-storey high-rise upon
which was shown a revolving restaurant.

The citizens intervened with the authorities; political shenanigans
followed; the citizens naturally lost. In 1993 the builders
commenced construction and the citizens filed a constitutional
petition in the Sindh High Court. In January 1994, the court
granted status quo and the construction was stopped. In September
1995, judges of the High Court dismissed the citizens' petition. In
1996, an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court and the construction
was once again stopped. In 1999, a five-member bench heard the
appeal and then gave a detailed order - no high-rise to be
constructed; what had so far been constructed was to be demolished,
the builders to submit a revised plan for the tower. The citizens
had won.

The builders, absconders and others filed a review application in
the Supreme Court which was dismissed on merit. They then filed a
revised plan which was rejected by the KBCA stating that it was
contrary to the Supreme Court judgement. Another review application
was filed in the Supreme Court seeking a review of the same court's
review order. No provision in law exists for such a move. One judge
of our apex court referred the matter to be heard by a five-member
bench of his court. The application is still pending.

In August 1999, the builders filed a suit of sorts in the Sindh
High Court which was dismissed. Yet another suit was filed
(1756/99) and a single judge restrained the KBCA from demolishing
the building. In 2000, the citizens applied to the Sindh High Court
for a rejection of this suit. The case was heard/adjourned on
August 15, 16 and 29, on September 18, on October 10, on November
6, 21, and 29, on December 4, 7, 14, 18 and 21. On the last date
the hearings were completed and the judge reserved his order.

The half-constructed high-rise still stands despite the Supreme
Court orders, and the politicians and absconders involved are
anxiously waiting for 'the restoration of democracy'.

<a name="thed">The death of politics</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ayaz Amir

WHILE the national press has always been laden with a fair amount
of trash, trawling through that trash every morning used to take
some time. Not any more. Newspapers are a quick read these days.

Such has been the success of the policy of free expression that
after 14 months of a dispensation whose foremost specialization is
emerging as the capacity to put the nation to sleep, there is
nothing left to say. After all how many times can you launch the
same bromides, utter the same cliches?

It's a funny situation we are in. While the military government
proceeds on its chosen path, undeterred by criticism or even quite
often the dictates of common sense, the national press, having long
arrived at the frontiers of free speech, is beginning to droop and
falter, showing unmistakable signs of intellectual exhaustion.

The latest tank armour has plastic material which deflects shells
fired at it. A similar protective coating seems to cover this
government's leading figures, making them immune to sarcasm, irony
or even the brightest shafts of ridicule. General Ziaul Haq,
turning hypocrisy into an art form, used to take in criticism but
then laugh it away. His successors on the general staff have gone
one better than him: they have simply unplugged their earphones and
put them aside.

What we have as a consequence are a series of parallel lines: the
army high command and the nation, the government and the press, the
National Reconstruction Bureau and reality, NADRA and the voting
lists, General Moin Haider's liberal hawkishness and the unyielding
situation on the ground, Shaukat Aziz's optimism and the
contraction of the economy. All these are parallel tracks which do
not meet.

At the advent of the October Revolution if the bazaar was
depressed, politics was bright with hope, while the national press,
always prone to take itself more seriously than the circumstances
allow, was swept by the delusion that its hallowed word, burnished
by the government's commitment to freedom of expression, would
illumine the paths of reform and national renewal.

It was a sign of the times that when General Musharraf's photo
appeared with his two pet pups in his arms, the maudlin section of
the national press, famous for such intuitive leaps, was quick to
label him a liberal reformer. Pups are associated with playfulness.
A pair of black and white pups gives its name to a famous brand of
Scotch. Perhaps for the first time in recent history were pups in
the arms of a Generalissimo taken as symbols of liberal intent.

How long ago all this seems. The press, as already noted, has
exhausted its ammunition. The political field presents the aspect
of an oasis through which a conquering army has passed. What is
there to write about? The politics of the Muslim League, the return
of Benazir, the Great Mandate's telephone conversations from the
Holy Land, India's extension of a ceasefire in Kashmir, some
maulana's antics in a corner of the country, some more tough
pronouncements from the interior minister, some more news from the
Muslim League battlefront, another bulletin regarding the struggle
for democracy from Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan.

Every now and then, even as these exciting events unfold, some
politician or newspaper pundit rises from the gloom to helpfully
suggest 'exit strategies' for the military government. Nothing is
more calculated to tempt a cynic to reach for his gun. Did General
Musharraf or the generals who carted Nawaz Shariff off to prison on
October 12 (1999) consult any politician or pundit over their
'entrance strategy'? Are they likely to be out of breath for want
of an 'exit strategy'?

A chowkidar kicks and screams, a patwari or a thanedar moves heaven
and earth, if his job is threatened. And here it is being seriously
suggested that the present group of generals are so keenly aware of
their mounting difficulties that they are looking for a safe way to
relinquish power. For naivete of this order there is no cure.

Tension was writ large on General Musharraf's face at the height of
the Kargil crisis. Today he shows every sign of relishing his role
as senior statesman, the Lee Kuan Yew of the Islamic Republic. His
smile is easier, his gestures more relaxed. Most of the corps
commanders too are enjoying their jobs. After all, playing the role
of civilian administrators and running hockey and cricket affairs
(and in the case of Lt-Gen Jamshed Gulzar assuming, for all
practical purposes, the role of Chairman, Municipal Corporation,
Rawalpindi) are infinitely preferable to the spartan routine of
military supervision.

Lt-Gen Gulzar is not to be blamed. His diocese runs from 'Pindi to
the farthest corners of the north. Anyone in his place would find
the task of inspecting Rawalpindi's roads and handing out shields
to the Islamabad Police (whose senior officers seem to be a bunch
of public relations specialists) more fun than keeping his eyes on
training or visiting Siachen. This approach betokens the right
priorities, for let us not forget that amongst the easiest tastes
to acquire is the taste for power. And once acquired it is a hard
thing giving up.

The extended tribulations of Mian Azhar, the Chaudries of Gujrat,
Exalted Son Ejazul Haq and the other Muslim League hopefuls should
fool no one. Military leaders always stand in need of civilian fig-
leafs. Ayub needed his Convention League, Yahya his collaborators,
Zia his anti-PPP coalition, the ISI its Islami Jamhoori Ittehad.
Forget about Pakistan's tin-pot Caesars. Even Stalin, history's
most feared despot, was not above using the fig-leaf of democratic
or collegial consultation.

Musharraf's military government may be learning on the job (an
expensive form of education for which the nation has to pay the
bills) but it too will have to abide by the enduring principles of
praetorianism. Sooner or later it will require a fig-leaf to cover
its nakedness. That is when the Mian Azhars will come into their
own. Not to show any exit strategies to General Musharraf, a favour
he can do without. But to act as cheer-leaders to the new
dispensation when the military government discards its uniform and
puts on a sherwani and declares, in accordance with the wishes of
the Supreme Court, that democracy has been restored.

As connoisseurs of this political genre will recognize, the script
is familiar except for a vital difference. While previous military
governments were strong affairs, they had to put up with strong
democratic movements. A cynical view of the past should not skate
lightly over the democratic resistance to Ayub and Zia (Yahya's
being a slightly different case). This time round, seen from any
angle, Pakistan has a weak military government, amateurish in
performance and unsure of its direction. Yet any strength it has
comes in no small measure from the discrediting and disarray of the
political parties.

The Daughter of the East in exile, tarred by the brush of
corruption. The PPP at home a pathetic collection of flunkeys and
underlings with no initiative of their own and dancing to whatever
direction they get from abroad. The Heavy Mandate, proving true to
its roots, choosing flight over defiance. The Muslim League riven
by dissension: one half dreaming of a Nawaz Sharif return, the
other frustrated with the military government's failure to take it
on board.

Guided by sharper political instincts, Musharraf's generals could
have brought about the crack-up of the Muslim League sooner. All
they had to do was to pick a favourite horse round which the
dispirited battalions of the League, leaving Nawaz Sharif to his
fate, would quickly have gathered. The trouble was that in the
beginning these generals considered themselves above such games.
They saw themselves as Kemalist reformers destined to turn the
country's fortunes around. Like other illusions this one too is
buried, the old truths of military interventionism reasserting
themselves.

So often has this cycle been repeated that it can have little
novelty for those who have seen it before. Is it any wonder then if
newspapers, which must feed on their environment, are proving such
poor starts to the day?

<a name="isra">Israel as a colonial venture</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

SOMETIMES things have to get worse before they can get better.
Palestine is currently at this juncture: the election of a war
criminal like Sharon as prime minister of Israel will sharpen the
contradiction between the dictates of a lasting peace and the
illegal occupation of Palestinian land.

Conventional wisdom has it that Sharon's rise to supreme power in
Israel will end any chance of a peaceful settlement of the
festering dispute. In reality, what it will end is any lingering
false hope that the Oslo accords could lead to a lasting peace. It
has become clear that despite the huge disparity between Israeli
and Palestinian military, political and economic strength, a
settlement imposed through sheer might and diplomatic arm-twisting
cannot long endure.

While Yasser Arafat and his Palestinian Authority may have a vested
interest in accepting a fragmented chunk of territory as a means to
acquire the trappings (and personal financial benefits) of
statehood, the common Palestinian, seeing no benefit in such an
arrangement, has strongly rejected it.

For years, the 'peace process' has meandered on, promising little
and delivering even less. The Israelis were in a win-win situation:
the longer it took to reach a final settlement, the longer they
could retain their conquered territories and fill them with more
Jewish settlements. Even when they signed a peace accord, they
would retain large swathes of territory on the pretext of
'security' as well as for roads connecting their settlements with
each other and with Israel.

There has been great concern in the West, most notably in America,
over the Palestinian refusal to accept Barak's proposals. Clinton
went to the extraordinary extent of blaming Arafat's obduracy for
this impasse that, in turn, has resulted in the on-going bloodshed.
An impression has been created in the West that Barak was being
very generous in his offer. Actually, he was offering nothing more
than to return only some of the territories captured by force. By
some trick of logic and morality, Iraqi occupation of Kuwait cannot
be tolerated, but Israeli occupation of Palestine is perfectly all
right.

Let us see just what the Palestinians were being asked to accept:
according to the western media, they would get back 95% of their
land. This is not true as the actual figure is around 83% since a
large area of the West Bank was annexed to Jerusalem years ago, and
this would naturally go to Israel, together with most of the holy
city. Then, in return for about 5% of their fertile land on which
settlements have been built, Palestinians were being asked to
accept arid land near the Gaza strip.

An indefinite military presence in the West Bank near Jordan was
part of the bitter pill on offer, as was the Israeli right to fly
over Palestinian airspace. And to put things in clearer
perspective, we need to remember that the West Bank and Gaza
represent only 22% of the original, pre-Israel Palestine.

These restrictions on sovereignty, when combined with the Israeli
settlements and road network in the occupied areas, will give some
idea why the intifada is seen as the only option left for the
Palestinians. Barak's insistence on retaining Israeli control and
sovereignty over the Muslim holy sites of Jerusalem was simply the
last straw. Clearly, statehood under these terms would have been
unacceptable to any people anywhere.

Now that the mask of peace is off, we can see Israel for what it
has really been all along; a colony created out of conquered land.
The problem is that it came into being in a period that saw the end
of colonization. And while it was recognized and legitimized by the
United Nations, its fundamentally colonial nature did not change:
it displayed the same conqueror's arrogance towards the
Palestinians that it did towards its neighbours. Because of its
overbearing attitude and its reliance on open-ended American
military and diplomatic support, it has always been perceived as a
western outpost forcibly planted in the Middle East to secure
western political and economic goals.

No matter how good the relations between colonialists and
subjugated people, there comes a point in time when the latter
decide to throw off the yoke and gain independence. Most ex-
colonies have received external material and moral support in their
struggle, but in the case of Israel, the true nature of the
conflict was blurred by the Zionist claim to Palestine on mythical
and religious grounds. Add to this European and American guilt over
the genocide of Jews committed by the Nazis, and it is easy to see
why the rights of the victims have been largely overlooked in the
West.

David Hirst, probably the most well-informed and perceptive
journalist writing about the Middle East today, wrote in a recent
issue of the Guardian: "...the risk is... that sooner or later the
success it [Israel] has achieved will be challenged and, in the
end, instead of being the exception in the annals of European
colonialism, it will suffer the same fate as all the rest." He goes
on to quote Rami Khouri, a Jordanian columnist as writing that the
longer the intifada continues, "the more self-evident it becomes
that the underlying policy of colonial occupation - outdated,
counter-productive, morally and politically rejected by the entire
world - is unsustainable and nearing its end."

The current low-intensity guerilla warfare being waged by the
Palestinians does not present a military challenge to the mighty
Israeli war machine. Instead, it erodes its image abroad, and its
morale at home. As the contradictions between Israel's need to be
accepted and recognized by its neighbours and its insatiable
appetite for Palestinian land become more apparent, any acceptable
peace accord recedes into the realm of the impossible. Even if
Arafat were to sell out his people and accept whatever the Israelis
offer him, this would not result in a lasting settlement.

There is now a broad consensus that a viable Palestinian state must
emerge with its capital in Jerusalem. Anything short of this is a
non-starter. The problem is that the majority of Israelis,
encouraged by successive governments to think that their might
would automatically result in security, settlements and legitimacy,
are not prepared to accept an agreement based on equality with, and
respect for, the Palestinians. With the typically colonial and
racist attitude of superiority and arrogance, they remain confident
that their firepower and the unlimited American support they enjoy
will prevail.

This easy confidence is reminiscent of French and British attitudes
towards their colonies and their subjects: until the very end,
Europeans could not come to terms with the intensity of the
feelings their subjects harboured. The Colonel Blimps sat in their
clubs, nursing their chota pegs, complaining about he ingratitude
of the natives, until they had to pack their bags and go home. Now,
the Raj lives on only in romantic movies and books. How long before
the Israeli venture meets the same fate?

<a name="judi">Judicial-executive interactions</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Khalid Anwer

AN important issue which has surfaced in recent days relates to the
question as to whether, and if so, in what circumstances, it is
appropriate for a law minister to interact with the judiciary.
Although the question has arisen in the crucible of an intense
political controversy I propose to discuss it both academically as
well as specifically.

The take-off point must inevitably be the Constitution itself.
Article 99 of the Constitution provides for the framing of Rules of
Business. These Rules are in essence the template which regulates
the functioning of the great departments of the state. Under
Schedule II, the law ministry is responsible for interacting with
the Supreme Court and the High Courts. This then is part of the
constitutional responsibility of the law minister. It is worth
trying to understand the rationale for this. The judicial branch of
the state, like the other branches, has numerous requirements which
need to be resolved. For example, one judge may anticipate a
pension problem, another may have a security problem. The judiciary
may find that its budgetary requirements are inadequate and so
forth. All these problems come to the law ministry for resolution.

Amongst the most important is the question of the enforcement of
the laws of the land. Let us take a simple illustration. Billions
of rupees in tax revenue may be blocked because of pending
litigation. The government has a legitimate interest in seeking an
expeditious disposal of tax cases. The problem can only be resolved
by an interaction between the executive and the judiciary. The law
ministry provides the interface and channels of communication.
There has never been a law minister in the history of Pakistan who
has not interacted with the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or
the Chief Justices and senior judges of the High Courts.

This is so not merely in relation to Pakistan but also in other
countries. For example, Professor Robert Stevens (formerly
professor of law at Yale and then Master of Pembroke College,
Oxford) in The Independence of the Judiciary has observed that "in
the English system the judges control neither the administration of
the courts nor their finances."

The position is not very different in the United States. Justice
Burger, who was Chief Justice of the United States for 17 years,
made it a point to develop cordial relations with Congress. One
commentator remarked that the Chief Justice had "charmed" the
Chairman of the House Subcommittee dealing with the court's budget.
(See "The Brethren" by Woodward and Armstrong). The present Chief
Justice, William Rehnquist, is even more of an establishment
figure. He was appointed by a Republican president and had earlier
served as assistant attorney-general and, rather ironically, had
officially supported telephone tapping without a court order. His
was, of course, the key vote which led to George Bush's winning in
the litigation with the Democratic candidate, Al Gore, and thus
ascending to the presidency.

The situation in India is similar to that in Pakistan. Serious
problems normally arise not because there are communications
between the law minister and the judges but when the channels of
communication break down. A good illustration is provided by the
resignation last year of law minister Ramchandani because of a
serious falling out with Chief Justice Anand of India. (The Chief
Justice suspected that the law minister was responsible for the
leaking to the press of a news item about his wife.) The result of
this was to poison the tenor of official communications between
them. As tempers waxed and the courtesies of discourse waned, the
normal flow of official business was seriously disrupted and
eventually the law minister was asked to resign. The prime minister
preferred to maintain relations with the Chief Justice rather than
the law minister.

As law minister one of my important responsibilities related to the
expeditious disposal of banking cases. As is well known, the
recovery of billions of rupees in bad debts was held up in the
courts. In order to dispose of these cases I introduced a new law
in 1997 which led to an enormous disposal of cases. At a rough
estimate, I would say, that in the period of two years after the
passage of the new law probably more suits were decreed in favour
of banks than in the previous twenty years. Every month I
personally monitored reports of the disposal of these cases. I
called openly on judges in various courts and many of those visits
were shown on television. There was no impropriety about it. There
was no concealment about it.

A second major area of concern related to the functioning of the
Ehtesab Act, 1997. The important aspect of this Act, for purposes
of the present matter, is the fact that Section 10 provided that
Ehtesab cases would be heard on a day-to-day basis and disposed of
within 60 days. The Act (unlike the NAB law) also provided that the
Ehtesab judge be nominated by the Chief Justice and not the
government.

Benazir Bhutto's was a high-profile case. It was inevitable that
public attention should be focused on it. If the law was not being
followed in her case what was the likelihood of its being followed
in other cases. The essence of accountability is that it focuses on
the big fish - if an accountability net catches minnows and allows
whales to escape it is not worth retaining. If the queen on the
political chessboard can move unhindered, it little matters what
happens to the pawns. The delays in her case provided a justifiable
cause for concern. Instead of the case proceeding on a day-to-day
basis, it lingered on for months on end. (It needs reiteration that
in the transcript of the allegedly taped conversation I have not,
repeat not, indicated directly or indirectly, what the decision
should be. I am merely alleged to have asked for an expeditious
disposal of the case.) Indeed, the government could even have
issued a statement expressing its concern about the delay in
disposal as the present government has done in other accountability
cases.

The Benazir Bhutto case also had an important historical context.
After the dismissal of the first Benazir Bhutto government, a large
number of references were filed against her under the then
prevailing accountability law. It is a matter of historical record
that these cases were not disposed of during its entire tenure of
office. Delaying tactics by her succeeded brilliantly. She was
determined that the cases would not be decided and her will
prevailed. She went scot free. In her imperial style she took it as
her right. Towards the end of 1993 she once again triumphantly
emerged as prime minister. Those cases which had taken years
without being disposed of were now dismissed, literally in a matter
of days. Since the prosecutors were now functioning under her
orders it was inevitable that she should be acquitted in all those
cases. It is understandable that she was determined to re-use the
strategy which had so brilliantly succeeded the first time round.
The iron butterfly was once again planning to gracefully ascend
above her baffled prosecutors.

Unlike the provisions of the Ehtesab Act, English law does not lay
down any specific time period for disposal of cases. However, cases
in which judges have delayed rendering judgment within a reasonable
period have been viewed with disfavour. An important case which
highlights the point, is that of Goose vs. Wilson Sandford & Co.
(The Times Law Reports, 1998). The brief facts of the case are that
the plaintiff had filed a suit against the defendants for damages.
The judgment was delayed for a period of 20 months. What did the
plaintiff do? He requested his solicitors to write a letter to the
judge complaining about the delay. They did so. The judge's clerk
replied that the judgment was in the process of being drafted.

Eventually the judge decided against the plaintiff. He appealed.
What did the Court of Appeal do? Did it censure the plaintiff's
solicitors for addressing a letter to the judge instead, of making
an application? No. Instead it censured the judge. Here are some of
the observations made by the Court of Appeal: "Compelling parties
to await judgment for indefinitely extended periods prolonged, and
probably increased, the stress and anxiety inevitably caused by
litigation, and weakened public confidence in the whole judicial
process. Left unchecked, it would be ultimately subversive of the
rule of law. A situation like this must never occur again."

Stronger words can scarcely be envisioned. The delay is described
as being "subversive of the rule of law". That too in what was
merely a civil dispute. Is not the position much worse in a
criminal prosecution against a former prime minister who is accused
of taking commissions running into millions of dollars? The above
case is not unprecedented. In the case of Rolled Steel Products vs.
British Steel Corporation [1985] (3) A.E.R. 52), the Court of
Appeal expressed its concern by observing that such delays could
"create suspicion among litigants who lose".

Another illustration of a private communication by a lawyer to a
judge is provided by the case of International Credit & Investment
Co. Ltd. vs. S.K. Adham & others (No.CH 1992-F-8667). The
defendants refused to appear and defend the case. Instead, they
engaged a firm of English solicitors who simply wrote a letter to
the judge and informed him of their opinion that the High Court in
England was not competent to deal with the case. Of course, if this
was really the position then they should have filed an application
to this effect. They had not done so. Instead, they had simply
written a letter.

The judge did not, however, consider this unethical or improper. He
referred to the letter in his judgment and observed: "If Messrs.
Berwin Leighton (the English solicitors) wish to maintain that view
I would be delighted if they, on behalf of their clients would
brief counsel to come and argue the point before me." He then
proceeded to decide the case on the merits.

IN Pakistan the position is equally clear. Suppose a judge is not
disposing of a case. The file is lying in the judge's chamber. What
is an aggrieved party to do? The answer can readily be found by
consulting any number of experienced counsel at random. Numerous
illustrations would be found of cases in which, in such
circumstances, a counsel has gone and met the judge in his chamber
and politely requested that the judgment may kindly be delivered as
soon as possible. It happens routinely and there is no impropriety
in this.

If a private lawyer can complain to a judge about a delay in
deciding a case, what debars a law minister, who has a stronger
reason for so requesting, from politely requesting an expeditious
disposal of a case. It should be remembered that the stronger
reason arises out of his dual capacity: firstly, the government
itself is the single largest litigant in the country and all such
litigation is carried on under the umbrella of the law ministry,
and, secondly, the law minister also has responsibilities for
ensuring that the law of the land is observed.

Taken in tandem, these are formidable reasons. It is natural for
the executive to seek an early disposal of cases and it is equally
natural for judges to give primacy to the quality of their
judgments rather than their quantity. There is nothing wrong with a
judicial-executive interaction on the matter.

The point can be put slightly differently as well. Can it be a
crime to ask that the law should be enforced? Only a biased mind
and a prejudiced tongue can so assert. This has been confirmed by
the public comment of an eminent former Chief Justice of the Sindh
High Court and a judge of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, Mr.
Justice Wajihuddin Ahmed, who in The News dated February 5, was
quoted as saying that for a law minister to request a court of law
to decide a case expeditiously does not amount to contempt of
court.

Now I turn to the genuineness of the alleged transcripts. In the
above I have assumed their genuineness. In fact, there is no reason
to do so. To doctor tapes is the easiest thing in the world. The
learned judge involved has categorically denied their genuineness.
Without wishing to go into details, what can be done at this stage
is to point out the manifest discrepancies which cast doubt on the
genuineness of the transcripts.

(a) Let us begin with Mr. Rahim, the alleged author, of the letter
dated January 29, sent to the president "through official
channels". The Presidency has confirmed that the letter had not
reached it prior to the publication of the Sunday Times report on
February 4, 2001. How then could the letter have leaked out in
advance? In fact, conclusive evidence exists which demonstrates the
falsity of Mr Rahim's version. The letter which reached the
Presidency was sent from Austria. Do the official channels of the
Intelligence Bureau run through the blue Danube? (What, I wonder,
is the name of Benazir's favourite waltz?)

(b) The December 27, 2000, issue of The News carries a report
datelined from London stating that the People's Party was in
possession of tapes of conversations between Mr. Saifur Rehman with
several judges. How, therefore, could a letter, which had not yet
been written, be in the possession of the People's Party?

(c) Mr. Rahim is stated to be a permanent employee of the
Intelligence Bureau. He has now apparently given up his permanent
job in order to live as an exile in England. Obviously Mr. Rahim
has made a major financial sacrifice. Is it not clear beyond any
conceivable doubt that he must have been more than adequately
remunerated by some hidden hand for this? Whose is that hidden
hand?

(d) It is a well established fact that Benazir Bhutto while, on the
one hand, excoriating the Intelligence Agencies, has, on the other,
maintained close relationships with them. When President Farooq
Leghari sacked her government, one of the grounds given in the
dissolution order was that she had ordered the tapping of the
telephones of "judges of the superior courts, leaders of political
parties and high-ranking military and civil officials." The court
upheld this charge in the light of the detailed evidence and
transcripts which came on record. With her intimate knowledge of
the functioning of the Intelligence Bureau, which used to report
directly to her, it should not cause any surprise that she has now
been able to utilize, or misutilize, links which had been forged in
the past.

(e) Benazir Bhutto's conduct on the public disclosure of the
alleged letter is also extraordinarily noteworthy. She delightedly
proclaimed to the press that this was the best news she had
received in the past four years and that it was a "miracle". If
indeed it was a "miracle" then the only possible comment is that
this perhaps is the only documented miracle in recorded history
which has been planned, organized and paid for in foreign exchange.
Miracles are supposed to have a divine provenance - but not this
one. It is clearly a homegrown product.

(f) Although it would be fair to say that my name is unlikely to
appear prominently in a list of the ardent admirers of Benazir
Bhutto, I have never doubted her formidable skills as a polemicist
and a publicist. The West has nothing to teach the Daughter of the
East insofar as the arts of media suasion are concerned. Indeed, if
her administrative abilities had even remotely approached her
finely honed skills as a publicist, this country would have been a
far better governed country than it was during her two terms of
office. She has the advantage of coming from a smaller province
while enjoying support in the largest one.

If she could bring herself to resist the alliterative allures of
creating confrontations between Lahore and Larkana she could still
be a potent force for the unification of a fissiparous country
riven by schismatic fissures. Sadly, she has never been able to
resist short-term political gains : distant political horizons have
no charm for her. The paths of statesmanship lie in conflict
resolution rather than the opposite. But for her, during her tenure
in office, the Shavian maxim "the art of government is the
organization of idolatry" remained the lodestar of her life. She
lived by it then and echoes of this maxim still swirl around her
even in exile.

(g) She claims she wants an impartial court. However, her
ostensible concerns about ensuring a completely impartial judiciary
have surfaced in somewhat peculiar ways in the past. When she was
prime minister she appointed a judge to the Lahore High Court who
was at that time the accused in a murder trial. Another peculiar
appointment was that of a gentleman whose earlier illegal
appointment by her to another post had led the court to uphold the
dismissal of her first government (See PLD 1991 Lah. 78, 163).

But despite this verdict, she persisted in her endeavours. Was it
not tempting Providence to once again appoint the same officer, but
this time to an even more elevated position? Or, perhaps, she
believed in the Wildean epigram that Providence was old enough to
resist temptation. Or perhaps she just did not care. It would be
otiose to multiply further examples of her hubris.

(h) She claims she seeks the truth. Her definition of the truth
however is reminiscent of Marxist-Leninist theorists who used to
proclaim that truth is a "functional" concept - that definition
which advanced the revolutionary cause was the only correct one. So
it is with her. If a court acquits her, it is impartial - not
otherwise. If an election propels her to power it is fair - not
otherwise.

(i) Benazir Bhutto proclaims, loudly and repetitiously, that she
cannot expect a fair trial in Pakistan because the judicial system
is biased against her. What should we do? Abolish all the courts in
Pakistan for her benefit? She seeks higher standards of justice
than are available in this country. In the 18th century the
American colonists sought to throw off the yoke of British rule.
Their demand for independence was pitched in extravagant terms as
the struggle of all humanity for freedom. It evoked a sardonic
response from Dr Samuel Johnson, the great lexicographer, who
wondered why it was that the loudest yelps for liberty came from
the slave drivers of America. So also do we wonder why no court is
good enough to satisfy her urge for justice.

(j) Let us assume that all courts in Pakistan, no matter where
located or of whatever level, are biased against her. But there is
still another option open to her. There is still another open
judicial door which beckons her. The court in Switzerland, which
has in its possession the original bank statements, has already
indicted her for money laundering. She has evaded appearing in
Switzerland up to now. She travels all around the world but
Switzerland is a country that she sedulously avoids. Why does she
not go there? Surely the Swiss court is impartial. However, one can
be certain that she will never appear in Switzerland. She is
afraid, not of a partial court but an impartial one. That is the
bottom line.

(k) Her acolytes follow with scrupulosity in her footsteps. Do they
not know that the Supreme Court has fixed the hearing of her appeal
on the 26th of this month? How is it then that they so clamorously
proclaim her innocence? Why is it that they use the platforms of
the bar associations to pursue their party political agenda. The
disputed tapes have admittedly been in her possession for several
months. Yet, how is it that they have only now been released on the
eve of the hearing before the Supreme Court? Can this be a
coincidence? Or is it evidence of a deeper conspiracy?

<a name="over">Pakistan overcome rusty fielding to beat New Zealand</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

WELLINGTON, Feb 22: Pakistan went 2-1 up over New Zealand here on
Thursday night with two to play in the one day series, but were
fined in the process for slow play.

They skittled New Zealand for 215 with ten balls remaining to win
by 28 runs after topping their previous batting effort by more than
100 runs in scoring 243 for nine in their 50 overs.

Pakistan offspinner Saqlain Mushtaq claimed Man-of-the-Match
honours with a tidy three for 26 off nine overs.

"It's been a concern all the way through, top order batting and an
inability to cope with a world class bowling attack," New Zealand
captain Stephen Fleming said afterwards.

Pakistan captain Moin Khan was still smiling despite his side was
shrugged off the 25 per cent match-fee fine because his team
bounced back from their six-wicket loss against New Zealand in
Napier.

Moin said the team, which contained three changes from the side
that lost on Tuesday including the loss of Shoaib Akhtar through
injury, provided a good combination. It was a good combined effort
today," he said.-AFP/Reuters
