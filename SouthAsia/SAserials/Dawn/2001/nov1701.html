<a name="uspl">US planes drop bombs in Kurram Agency</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Abdul Sami Paracha

KOHAT, Nov 16: US warplanes dropped bombs on border towns in the 
Kurram Agency, causing damage to various buildings and houses, 
official sources told Dawn.

It was the first incident of bombardment on Pakistani territory 
since the start of air strikes against Afghanistan. Earlier, the US 
planes had twice hit the targets along the border on no-man's land.

The assistant political agent of lower Kurram Agency, Wakil Khan, 
told this correspondent by telephone that two warplanes had dropped 
four bombs on Shahdal and Spina Shaga towns in the upper parts of 
the tribal territory and more inside Afghanistan in the Gurway 
Tangi.

Mnay buildings and houses were damaged in the bombing, he said. No 
loss of human life was reported, he said. He said the Kurram 
Agency, predominantly a pro-Northern Alliance area, had been 
declared an "extremely sensitive" area after the Taliban's retreat.

The official said that he had instructions not to allow anybody, 
including foreign journalists, from across the border. However, he 
added, there were no restrictions on the refugees who wanted to go 
back to their homeland.

During the past many days, he pointed out, nearly 300 refugees had 
gone back to Afghanistan and more were being encouraged by the 
Afghan Commissionerate for Refugees and the local authorities to 
follow suit.

The official said that security had been beefed up along the border 
and efforts were being made to guard the unmanned frontiers or far-
flung porous areas.

<a name="meas">Measures to close border reviewed </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 16: President Gen Pervez Musharraf held a meeting 
with the governors of NWFP and Balochistan, and reviewed measures 
taken to ensure sealing of over 1,500km Durand Line.

"Some troops have been moved to supplement the scouts and the 
Frontier Constabulary at the border between Afghanistan and 
Pakistan. The aim is to make sure that the border is sealed," 
President's spokesman Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi said at the daily 
foreign office briefing.

The meeting, also attended by Vice Chief of Army Staff Gen Muhammad 
Yusaf Khan, Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider, corps commanders of 
Peshawar and Quetta, reviewed the internal security and the Afghan 
situation, he said.

"Except for the extreme humanitarian cases nobody without valid 
travel documents would be allowed to enter Pakistan," said Maj-Gen 
Qureshi.

The meeting was briefed about the impact of recent developments in 
Afghanistan on the western borders and influx of refugees. The 
meeting was informed about the coordinated steps, including the 
deployment of troops, civil armed forces, scouts and other assets, 
being taken for ensuring security on the western borders. Maj-Gen 
Qureshi refuted reports that tanks had also been moved to the areas 
bordering Afghanistan.

He said the number of troops deployed on the borders was not very 
large. However, he added, they were enough to ensure sealing of the 
borders.

The spokesman refuted reports that some bombs had been dropped 
inside the Pakistani territory. He said the authorities had 
verified and the bombs had been dropped close to Pakistani 
territory but not inside.

secure its northern international frontiers with Afghanistan in the 
wake of the critical situation along the border.

said adding that tanks were seen for the first time in Chaman since 
the US attacks on Afghanistan.

Official sources said that the troops' movement was part of routine 
exercises in the area. Also, reports coming from Kandahar say that 
the Taliban government has imposed night curfew in Kandahar and 
people were asked to stay indoors between 9pm and 6am.

ISLAMABAD, Nov 14: Pakistan has ordered a special watch on its 
border with Afghanistan in case Osama bin Laden tries to slip 
across, officials said. With pressure mounting on Kandahar, next to 
the Pakistan border, a top Pakistan government official said troops 
were on a special "Osama" alert.

"The government is aware of all possibilities and is taking all 
possibilities into account," the official, who requested anonymity, 
told AFP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Nov 14: In highly sarcastic remarks, ARD President 
Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan 'congratulated' President Musharraf on his 
first 'success' in having US President Bush 'honour' his words 
about the Northern Alliance's entry in Kabul.

Speaking to newsmen at his residence, he said at a joint news 
conference Presidents Bush and Musharraf had said that the Northern 
Alliance would not enter Kabul after the withdrawal of the Taliban. 
But, he pointed out, the Northern Alliance forces not only entered 
Kabul but NA representative in the United Nations also claimed that 
the forces had a nod from the United States.

He said the NA forces were also committing atrocities, contrary to 
the US assurances given to President Musharraf. In his opinion, the 
situation in Afghanistan would remain unstable and the guerrilla 
war would go on in the foreseeable future.

<a name="unpl">UN plan for new setup</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK, Nov 13: The United Nations proposed a five-point plan to 
establish an inclusive post-Taliban government in Afghanistan, 
which it said should be backed by an all-Afghan security force 
rather than a UN peacekeeping operation.

The proposals were presented by the UN's envoy to Afghanistan, 
Lakhdar Brahimi, to the UN Security Council, which convened hours 
after opposition Northern Alliance forces took over Kabul.

The fast-paced military events in Afghanistan prompted UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to urge the council to take "urgent 
action" to prevent a political and security vacuum there.

The five points of the plan are:

* The United Nations will convene a meeting between the Northern 
Alliance and other Afghan groups to discuss the political future of 
the country.

* That meeting will take "concrete steps" to form a provisional 
council.

* That council will discuss the transition to a new administration 
within two years.

* A traditional Afghan council, a "Loya Jirga", of ethnic chiefs 
will be convened.

* During a transitional phase, the "Loya Jirga" will meet a second 
time to set up a government.

Mr Brahimi repeated UN demands for a broad-based, multi-ethnic, 
freely-chosen, "home-grown" government to replace the Taliban.

Mr Annan, in his opening remarks to the council, urged neighbours 
of Afghanistan and the world to agree to a "broad- based, fully 
representative government which the UN has long been trying to help 
the Afghan people achieve". "This requires the end of interference 
in Afghanistan's affairs by neighbouring countries," he said. 
"Unless this happens - on the level of reality rather than just 
rhetoric - there can be little hope of lasting stability in 
Afghanistan," he said.

However, Mr Brahimi said Iran and Pakistan have a "special role" 
and "legitimate interests" in Afghanistan because of their 
geographical and historical ties.

The UN also plans to send a top official to Kabul as soon as 
security permits, and that it would convene a conference of various 
factions.-dpa/AFP

<a name="allf">All forces must pull out of Kabul: CE: UN peacekeepers demanded</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISTANBUL, Nov 13: President Gen Pervez Musharraf called for all 
forces to withdraw from Kabul and the deployment of a UN force in 
the city following its capture by the Northern Alliance. "Kabul 
should remain a demilitarized city," Gen Musharraf said after a 
brief meeting with Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit during a 
stopover on his way from New York to Islamabad.

The president stressed that Kabul's demilitarized status was very 
important to avoid ethnic clashes in the city that had led to 
atrocities in the past. "The Northern Alliance or any other 
group... must not enter Kabul because we know from the past 
experience the kind of atrocities and killings that took place in 
Kabul. We don't want that to happen again," he said.

"It is very important that there is some kind of a UN umbrella and 
a UN force, maybe also specially composed of OIC countries, which 
means the Muslim countries, to be there for the purpose of giving 
stability," he said. Turkey and Pakistan, he added, could play a 
role in such a peacekeeping force.

To avoid ethnic conflict in Afghanistan, a formula for the 
country's future administration should be outlined as soon as 
possible with the participation of all ethnic groups, including the 
dominant Pakhtoon, who form the majority of the Taliban, the 
president said.

"We must come out with a political arrangement as fast as possible. 
The more this vacuum lasts, the more there will be a danger of 
infighting," he said. "Any political arrangement must be multi-
ethnic according to the demographic composition of Afghanistan... 
There has to be a Pakhtoon representation, because at the moment 
within the Northern Alliance there is no Pakhtoon representation, 
this must emerge," he added.

Pakistan, he pointed out, would not welcome any Taliban troops on 
its soil if they fled to Pakistan. "They must remain in 
Afghanistan, we would not like to accept anybody in Pakistan, we 
already have 2.5 million refugees, we cannot accept any more".-AFP

<a name="powe">Power-sharing formula yet to be finalized</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohammed Riaz

PESHAWAR, Nov 13: The eastern zone Shoora, a military platform of 
the anti-Taliban commanders from Laghman, Nangarhar, Nooristan and 
Kunar provinces, has been tipped as the main component of the 
future political setup in Afghanistan.

A group of European 'diplomats', who are staying in Peshawar, held 
meetings with the Shoora leaders and discussed modalities of the 
future arrangement in Kabul.

Haji Zaman Ghamsharik, a spokesman for the Shoora, underlined the 
need for a national government, under the UN umbrella, to be set up 
in Afghanistan. He urged the world community to work for a 
conducive atmosphere in the war-ravaged country.

Speaking to newsmen at the Rehman Lodge, Shoora's newly set up 
office in the University Town area, here on Tuesday, he asked the 
UN to help them in replacing Taliban, rapidly retreating from the 
every province of the country.

The Pakhtoon-dominated Shoora is feeling uneasiness after the 
storming of Kabul and Jalalabad by the Uzbek and Takjik-dominated 
Northern Alliance forces, who had unruffled their tri-colour flag 
on the important government buildings.

According to a European diplomat in Peshawar, "the status quo has 
been restored in Afghanistan with the commander Ismail Khan in 
Herat, Dostum in Mazar-i-Sharif and Gul Agha and Hamid Karzai in 
Kandahar. Haji Qadeer, brother of the slain commander Abdul Haq, 
will certainly take over Nangarhar province".

Afghan politicians and commanders are in a sort of a confused haste 
to replace the Taliban. They have yet not, sources said, reached on 
a viable power-sharing formula, which will certainly give an edge 
to the Northern Alliance in political bargain with the pro-king 
forces. "The Northern Alliance has emerged being the conqueror of 
Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat and Kabul", said a Jamiat-i- Islami leader.

<a name="warm">War media centre to be set up</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Arshad Sharif

ISLAMABAD, Nov 12: The United States and the United Kingdom have 
asked Pakistan to facilitate the setting up of a 24-hour 
information centre in Islamabad by next week to launch a media 
campaign against terrorism.

A US embassy official told Dawn that the proposed centre would be 
an effort to counter the Taliban and Osama bin Laden "propaganda".

The information secretary, Anwar Mehmood, answering a question 
about Pakistan's decision not to allow Taliban to hold press 
conferences and facilitating the establishment of the US-ed 
coalition force's information centre, said that Pakistan did not 
stop the Taliban from the press conference but only reminded them 
the third country rule.

The prime concern of the media managers, sources said, is that the 
media based in Pakistan splashes the "unfounded" Taliban claims 
around the world due to the fact that Pakistan is 10 hours ahead of 
Washington and five hours ahead of London. "By the time we can 
respond to the allegations, Taliban's lies have already become the 
headlines," a British official said.

<a name="sixp">Six-plus-two ministers back UN efforts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, Nov 12: Foreign ministers of Six-Plus Two group on 
Afghanistan endorsed efforts of Secretary General's special 
representative on Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi to establish a 
broad-based Afghan administration on urgent basis.

In a declaration issued following a short meeting of the group at 
the UN following the report of a plane crash in New York, the group 
said the post-Taliban government in Afghanistan should consist of 
multiple and wide-ranging ethnic groups.

The group reaffirmed the central role of the UN in assisting the 
Afghan people in developing a political alternative to Taliban 
regime.

The draft declaration marks the first time the Six Plus Two, 
comprising Pakistan, Iran, China, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, 
Uzbekistan, the US and Russia, presented a plan on the new Afghan 
government.

The meeting was attended by US Secretary of State Colin Powell, 
Russia's Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Chinese Foreign Minister 
Tang Xiajung, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharzai, UN Special 
envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi. The rest of the governments 
were represented by their permanent delegates at the UN.

Pakistan's Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar, who was in New York at 
the time, was not allowed to move out of the hotel where he was 
staying by the US Secret Service. However, he was briefed later by 
the UN envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi.

The group pledged continued support to the humanitarian efforts by 
the United Nations to alleviate the suffering of Afghan people, 
both inside Afghanistan and in refugee camps located in the 
neighbouring countries.

The new government must satisfy the requests of Afghan citizens, 
protect human rights, bring about stability in the region and meet 
Afghanistan's international obligations such as halting drug 
dealing, they said.

Earlier, Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar and the Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov met at the United Nations on Sunday and 
discussed the resolution of the Afghanistan situation.

<a name="bush">Bush-Musharraf joint statement: text</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK, Nov 12: The following is the text of the joint statement 
issued after the meeting between US President George W. Bush and 
Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf on Saturday:

President George W. Bush and President Pervez Musharraf met New 
York today and reaffirmed the strength and vitality of the 
bilateral relationship between Pakistan and the United States. The 
two Presidents expressed the conviction that the global coalition 
against terrorism is essential for the elimination of the Taliban 
regime and the Al-Qaida network and those who harbour them. 
President Musharraf welcomed the clear commitments expressed by 
President Bush to continued active United States engagement in 
Pakistan and the entire South Asian subcontinent.

President Bush and President Musharraf reaffirmed the benefits of 
50 years of friendship and close cooperation between Pakistan and 
the United States and recalled the pivotal role of the Pakistan-US 
alliance in the triumph of the free world at the end of the Cold 
War. They welcomed the revival of this longstanding partnership and 
expressed their conviction that it would constitute a vital element 
in the construction of a durable structure of peace, stability, 
economic growth and enhanced prosperity at the regional and global 
level. They also held wide- ranging discussions on the current 
anti-terrorism campaign and exchanged views on bilateral, regional, 
and international issues.

President Musharraf strongly condemned the terrorist attacks of 
September 11 and conveyed the sympathy and solidarity of the people 
and government of Pakistan to the people and government of the 
United States. President Bush recognized Pakistan's role as a 
front-line state in the global campaign against terrorism and 
expressed gratitude for Pakistan's vital support in the 
international campaign. Both leaders agreed to continue their 
ongoing excellent cooperation and to pursue a coherent and 
coordinated diplomatic, political, military, economic, financial 
and humanitarian strategy to eliminate terrorism.

President Bush stressed that the United States and Pakistan are 
friends of long-standing and that Pakistan is a great Islamic 
nation. He emphasized that the United States has great respect for 
Islam and noted the fast growth of the Islamic community in 
America.

President Bush stated that our campaign is against those who 
pervert a great religion in the service of evil.

President Bush and President Musharraf also discussed means of 
easing the plight of the Afghan refugees. President Bush recognized 
the leading role that Pakistan has played in receiving and caring 
for Afghan refugees and emphasized that the United States is the 
largest foreign donor of humanitarian aid. Even tonight, using our 
military resources, United States Planes are dropping badly needed 
food supplies to the Afghan people.

The two presidents agreed that the international community will 
have to provide sizable and sustained resources for the 
reconstruction of Afghanistan. They also affirmed their support for 
the efforts of the United Nations, Secretary General Annan, and 
Special Envoy Brahimi. They agreed that peace and stability in 
Afghanistan can be achieved through the institution of a broad-
based, multi-ethnic, representative government, established through 
consensus among Afghans, and evolved under the auspices of the 
United Nations. They also acknowledged that Afghanistan should 
enjoy friendly relations with all its neighbours and be a link 
between Central and South Asian, and free from the scourge of 
terrorism and drugs.

President Musharraf welcomed President Bush's decision to lift a 
number of sanctions that allow the resumption of cooperation with 
Pakistan. They agreed that the bilateral relationship is built on 
the shared interests and values of the American and Pakistani 
peoples. President Bush welcomed the efforts that the Pakistani 
citizens are making to support the coalition, against terrorism. 
Affirming their commitment to Pakistan's economic stabilization and 
revival program, President Bush pledged to promote economic 
assistance to Pakistan.

President Bush confirmed that he will extend support to enable 
Pakistan to respond to the economic challenges it confronts. The 
two presidents discussed ways to make good on the enormous 
potential for increased trade and investment between Pakistan and 
the United States and agreed to enter into extensive talks 
regarding economic issues. President Bush affirmed that the United 
States is committed to working with the international financial 
institutions to provide additional support for Pakistan. Financial 
assistance, debt relief, greater trade and investment 
opportunities, and sound Pakistani economic policies should assist 
Pakistan in its efforts to spur sustainable economic growth. 
Additionally, President Bush undertook to consider ways to respond 
to Pakistan's market access expectations.

regional security issues.  Both underscored the importance of 
Pakistan to have a successful transition to democracy in 2002.

<a name="msh">Musharraf rules out interim govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW YORK, Nov 13: President Pervez Musharraf has quashed 
speculation that he is planning an interim political government or 
changes in his cabinet.

When asked if there was any truth in such reports during his 
briefing to Pakistani correspondents, he said: "The chances of an 
interim arrangement, or changes in the cabinet or establishment of 
a political government are zero." Then he added, not without a 
broad smile, "Zero over zero, zero into zero, zero plus zero, 
multiplied by zero and zero equal to zero." Asked if all these 
zeros were on record, he replied: "Yes, every one of them."-APP

-------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW YORK, Nov 11: Gen Pervez Musharraf said that he would remain 
President of Pakistan, for the foreseeable future, beyond October 
2002 election.

Appearing in the NBC news program "Meet the Press," Gen Musharraf 
held out an assurance that elections to national and provincial 
assemblies would be held as stipulated by him. But he said 
emphatically that he would remain President whatever the election 
result.

He said former prime minister Benazir Bhutto would be arrested if 
she returned to Pakistan. "She has to face the charges in the court 
of law," he added.

<a name="paki">'Pakistan's nuclear arsenal redeployed at new sites'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NEW YORK, Nov 11: President Pervez Musharraf ordered an emergency 
redeployment of the country's nuclear arsenal to at least six 
secret new locations and has reorganized military oversight of the 
nuclear forces in the weeks since Pakistan joined the US campaign 
against terrorism, the Washington Post said quoting senior 
officials in Islamabad.

Pakistan's military began relocating critical nuclear weapons 
components within two days of the Sept 11 terrorist attacks in the 
United States, fearful of possible strikes against the country's 
nuclear facilities, military officials said.

Another reason for the movement, officials added, was to remove 
them from air bases and corridors that might be used by the United 
States in an attack on Afghanistan, the Post said.

President Musharraf also created a new Strategic Planning Division 
within the nuclear programme, headed by a three-star general to 
oversee operations. This decision, not previously disclosed, was 
part of the shuffle of top military and intelligence leaders just 
hours before the US bombing of Afghanistan began on Oct 7.

The shake-up was designed to sideline officers considered too 
sympathetic to the Taliban or other extremist religious factions, 
officials said.

Gen Musharraf's move was to help keep control of the nuclear 
program out of the hands of religious hard-liners in the military 
if he was assassinated or ousted from office, officials said.

UNITED NATIONS, Nov 11: President Gen Pervez Musharraf said that he

Dawn.

However, he added: "Chemical weapons are a possibility. But I have 
no such information."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Report

NEW YORK, Nov 11: The Dawn report about Osama bin Laden's claim 
that he possesses nuclear biological weapons and could possibly use 
them was the most talked about story in the corridors of the United 
Nations where world leaders met to declare war on terrorism.

Most world leaders expressed horror and disbelief at the claim made 
by Osama. US President Bush, at the joint press conference with 
President Musharraf, remarked: "It proves that he is an evil man." 
He noted that Osama "has now targeted Pakistan and Gen Pervez 
Musharraf in particular."

President Musharraf, on his part, dismissed Osama's claim, saying, 
"I can't imagine he has any nuclear weapons." But he added that 
"chemical weapons is another matter."

Almost every newspaper and television channel in the United States 
carried the report prominently and Dawn was referred to as the 
"most respected newspaper of Pakistan." Almost every television 
talk show in the United States (CNN, ABC TV, CBS TV, Fox TV 
network, and NBC etc) was reacting to the report and every known 
commentator was forced to respond to Osama's latest threat.

US Secretary of State Colin Powell dismissed Osama's claim as a 
"wild boast and threat" and said America would not use nuclear 
force against him.

Powell, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," said he had no idea 
whether the man accused in the Sept 11 attacks on the United States 
possessed chemical or biological weapons.

"I have no way of knowing, but I think it unlikely that he has any 
nuclear weapons," Powell said on the morning talk show, calling the 
assertion, "a wild boast and threat. I can't say about chemical and 
biological. But this is the kind of threat that this evil person 
likes to toss around."

<a name="oppo">Musharraf, Bush oppose Alliance's Kabul takeover</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza and Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Nov 11: Convergence of views on the current military 
campaign and a future dispensation in Afghanistan, a US pledge of 
increased economic assistance and agreement on diplomacy and 
dialogue to resolve the Kashmir issue marked President Pervez 
Musharraf's first meeting with President Bush.

A joint statement issued after the talks was short on specifics, 
but Pakistani spokesmen described the discussions between the two 
presidents spread over two hours as marking the revival of an old 
relationship and the beginning of a new one.

Talking briefly to reporters after the meeting, Gen Musharraf said 
Pakistan and the US had identical views on a post-Taliban setup 
based on the wishes of the people, and Mr Bush indicated that while 
the Northern Alliance would be encouraged to move south, the US 
would not want the alliance forces to enter Kabul.

This was described as the most specific comment so far by the US 
president on the direction of the war in Afghanistan and apparently 
backed the assessment of Gen Musharraf, who said his view that 
Kabul should not be taken by the alliance was based on the past 
experience of mayhem in the Afghan capital.

President Bush, in his brief appearance before the press with Gen 
Musharraf following his talks with the Pakistani leader, said the 
US would give up to $1 billion in aid to Pakistan, but it remained 
unclear whether this included the $600 million previously pledged 
by Washington after the campaign crisis began and sanctions were 
lifted from Pakistan. Perhaps more important was Mr Bush's remark 
that the administration hoped for legislation that would enable the 
US to improve market access for Pakistani goods.

Mr Bush also said he was pleased to hear from Gen Musharraf that 
the Pakistan president remained committed to his promise to return 
his country to democratic rule.

Mr Bush praised Pakistan's efforts in the fight against terrorism 
which, he said, benefited the entire world and linked Pakistan more 
closely with the international community. "The US wants to help 
Pakistan build these linkages. I've authorized a lifting of 
sanctions, and over $1 billion in US support. I will also help debt 
relief for Pakistan."

Asked to comment on the Osama bin Laden's interview published in 
Dawn in which he warned he had nuclear and chemical weapons and 
would use them if similar weapons were deployed by America, Mr Bush 
said he did not know what to believe and what not to believe in 
what Osama bin Laden said. But one thing he knew was that Osama bin 
Laden was "evil" and that what he had said only made it more 
pressing to bring him to justice.

According to the joint statement, President Bush said he was 
committed to working with international financial institutions to 
provide additional support for Pakistan, and undertook to consider 
ways to respond to Pakistan's market access expectations. There 
was, however, no word later from the Pakistani delegation of any 
details, and it seemed that the US side was still in the process of 
considering how best to help Islamabad meet the economic challenges 
it faces.

The two leaders expressed shared concern about the threat to global 
stability posed by the proliferation of ballistic missile and 
weapons of mass destruction. They agreed on the need for a 
comprehensive approach to counter these threats, including enhanced 
non-proliferation measures at the global and regional level.

Referring to South Asia, the joint statement said Gen Musharraf and 
Mr Bush "discussed ways to promote stability in South Asia. 
President Bush praised President Musharraf's recent call to Prime 
Minister Vajpayee of India. President Bush and President Musharraf 
agreed that India and Pakistan should resolve the Kashmir issue 
through diplomacy and dialogue in mutually acceptable ways that 
took into account the wishes of the people of Kashmir."

The Bush-Musharraf meeting followed a meeting between the US 
president and Mr Vajpayee a day earlier in Washington. Despite some 
reports that President Bush would invite Gen Musharraf for a more 
formal visit to Washington, the joint statement did not contain any 
mention of this, and the Pakistan briefing after the talks brought 
no clarification either on this point.

<a name="amer">American response disappoints CE: F-16 aircraft issue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Report

NEW YORK, Nov 11: President Gen Pervez Musharraf speaking on NBC's 
"Meet the Press" expressed disappointment with the US decision of 
not releasing the F-16s to Pakistan, and suggested that he was 
speaking about gestures which were more important than the planes 
themselves.

President Musharraf said that the US refusal to sell the fighter 
jets has been "received negatively" by citizens in his country. 
"This is one issue held very much against the United States," 
Musharraf said on "Fox News Sunday."

At a press briefing, Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi, spokesman for 
President Musharraf, downplayed the importance of getting F-16s, 
suggesting that the New York Times got the wrong impression. 
However, in the interview with the NBC news program President 
Musharraf said that he did ask for the planes of US President 
George Bush on Saturday as a gesture and expressed his 
disappointment with the US response.

The Bush administration said it will not transfer to Pakistan 
American F-16 fighter jets.

"There are no plans now to transfer those airplanes to Pakistan," 
said US secretary of state Colin Powell.

Mr Powell, speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press," said the US has a 
new military dialogue with Pakistan "but at the moment it does not 
include the transfer of those F-16s."

Separately, Mr Powell said Pakistan and India need to enter talks 
over Kashmir region, but the United States would not play a key 
role in settling the dispute. "To the extent that the United States 
could be helpful in fostering this dialogue, fine, but we cannot 
become the mediator, or the arbitrator or the intermediary between 
them," Mr Powell said.

Gen Musharraf on his part said President Bush had promised to 
facilitate talks.

<a name="pres">President wants US to release F-16 aircraft</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NEW YORK, Nov 10: President Pervez Musharraf said that he would 
seek concrete "gestures" from the United States, including release 
of F-16 fighters to demonstrate its appreciation of Pakistan 
support in the US campaign against terrorism.

In an interview with the New York Times, he said "visible gestures" 
of gratitude from the United States would help blunt public 
criticism of his decision to ally his country strongly with 
Washington.

He placed special emphasis on the F-16's, because their arrival 
would be the most visible sign that the United States was restoring 
Pakistan to the stature of a genuine ally.

The Times said that Gen Musharraf was not reticent in voicing his 
grievance with this treatment. Saying that "Pakistan certainly 
desires a long-standing and sustainable relationship with the 
United States," he said that "trust has to be built."

When asked whose fault it was, he said, "As a Pakistani, I have to 
say the fault lies with the United States." Gen Musharraf said 
there was a widespread sense that Washington abandoned Pakistan.

"The main issue is we were part of a coalition," he said. "We 
fought a war together and evicted the Soviet Union from 
Afghanistan." The gestures that would reverse these wrongs, he 
said, should include major debt relief, military assistance, and 
more understanding for the sensitivity of the Pakistani public on 
the issue of its nuclear weapons.

"The opinion of the people of Pakistan has to be moulded, and it 
can be done through gestures," he told the paper.

Gen Musharraf said he could not predict how long the bombing 
campaign could continue before the opposition within Pakistan 
became a threat to his government. He said he felt the intensity of 
demonstrations was actually diminishing.

Asked whether he felt slighted by Washington and by the Indian 
prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, he hesitated and said: "Well, 
sometimes, yes." 

He said this was understandable because he was a military man who 
had seized power.

The times said that the general spoke as reports came that Mazar-i-
Sharif in northern Afghanistan had fallen to the Northern Alliance. 
He commended the victory and said he had no reservations if the 
American-led coalition decided to set up a forward air base at the 
airfield near the town.

However, Gen Musharraf said that he was worried that the military 
victory had come when there still no broad-based coalition in the 
making to replace the Taliban if their grip on power dissolves. 
That problem would become more acute, he suggested, if and when the 
Northern Alliance began moving into Pakhtoon territory, where the 
Taliban have their strength, and specially into the capital, Kabul. 
Mazar-i-Sharif population is predominantly Uzbek. 

"I'm worried that Kabul should not be militarized because of the 
atrocities committed in the city," he said, alluding to the last 
time the Northern Alliance was in control of the city in 1996.

Gen Musharraf acknowledged that Pakistan bore a major 
responsibility in the efforts to forge a military alternative to 
the Taliban, but that this was still a work in progress. He said 
Afghans had been meeting in Islamabad and Peshawar to try to find 
some formula for a broad-based ethnic administration, the paper 
said.

"There's no alternative on the Pakhtoon side," he said, referring 
to the dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan.

<a name="want">America wants air base in Afghanistan, says Powell</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

LOS ANGELES, Nov 10: The US Secretary State, Colin Powell, said an 
airbase in Afghanistan would be beneficial for the US air force, 
saying "we must be patient with the Afghan resistance."

In an exclusive interview with a leading US channel, CBS, Powell 
said: "I think an airbase under our control in northern Afghanistan 
would facilitate a number of things that include humanitarian 
relief operations, but it is not absolutely essential to the 
campaign that we are conducting now."

He said the campaign was going well. "But we have to be patient and 
we have to remember that we've come into Afghanistan with a First 
World air force and now we're linking up our First World air force 
with Third World ground forces that are becoming more capable day 
by day, with a re- supply and ammunition being supplied by us as 
well as very, very brave American soldiers on the ground assisting 
them and showing them how best to do a ground attack against the 
kind of enemy they're facing and how best to integrate what a First 
World air force can do for you," Powell said.

However, most of the time Powell discussed the crisis in the Middle 
East, especially Palestine-Israel relations.

Powell clearly told CBS that there was no plan for a meeting 
between President Bush and Chairman Yasir Arafat in New York this 
week.

"I hope that I'll be able to meet with him, and we're working on 
that, so that we can continue our discussions about how we can get 
closer to a ceasefire and get into the Mitchell peace plan process 
that will lead the negotiations. But there are no plans for the 
President and Mr Arafat to meet."

<a name="stra">Strategic assets in safe hands: Musharraf</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza and Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, Nov 10: Declaring that Pakistan was "deeply 
conscious of the nuclear dimension of the security environment of 
our region", President Gen Pervez Musharraf said that Pakistan's 
strategic assets were well-guarded and in safe hands.

Gen Musharraf, who was addressing the UN General Assembly session 
attended by heads of state and government, said that Pakistan had 
"instituted an elaborate nuclear command control mechanism for 
ironclad custodial controls to ensure the safety and security of 
our assets."

Gen Musharraf expressed Islamabad's readiness to "discuss nuclear 
missile restraints as well as well nuclear risk-reduction measures 
with India in a structured, comprehensive, and integrated 
dialogue".

He said Pakistan, conscious of the danger posed by the nuclear 
dimension in South Asia and the responsibility it placed on India 
and Pakistan, was ready to discuss how the two countries could 
establish a stable regional security mechanism through a peaceful 
resolution of disputes, preservation of the nuclear and 
conventional balance, confidence-building measures and non-use of 
force as prescribed by the UN charter. Gen Musharraf strongly 
deplored the terrorist acts of Sept 11, but said terrorism was not 
a Christian, Buddhist, Jewish or a Muslim belief and had to be 
condemned whether it was perpetrated by an individual or a group or 
a state.

He also emphasized that the real causes that lead to extreme acts 
should be understood. He said: "To my mind, it is the unresolved 
political disputes the world over, disputes in Bosnia, Kosovo, 
Palestine, Kashmir and other places. Unfortunately all these 
disputes involve Muslims, and more sadly, the Muslims happen to be 
the victims which tends to give a religious tinge to these 
otherwise political disputes." The lack of progress in the 
resolution of these disputes had created a sense of deprivation, 
helplessness and powerlessness.

Referring to constant Indian criticism about "cross-border 
terrorism," the general said: "The frustration gets even worse when 
disputes like Kashmir and Palestine remain unsettled for decades 
despite UN Security Council resolutions. "The question then is 
whether it is the people asking for their rights in accordance with 
UN resolutions who are to be called terrorists or whether it is the 
countries refusing to implement UN resolutions who are perpetrators 
of state terrorism."

He pointed out that Indian occupation forces in Kashmir had killed 
over 5,000 Kashmiris but attributed these killings to foreign 
terrorists, adding that it was time India ended "such deceit". 
Security Council resolutions on Kashmir must be implemented.

In the context of the events of Sept 11, Gen Musharraf said 
Pakistan had tried its "utmost with the Afghan government, ever 
since Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda became an international issue, 
till the last moment to avert military action in Afghanistan. 
Regrettably, we did not meet with success, and the coalition 
operation against terrorism continued with no immediate end in 
sight."

Sadly, he said, civilian casualties were getting projected more as 
an open war against the already poor, suffering and innocent people 
of Afghanistan.

Gen Musharraf called for the military operation to be as short and 
accurately targeted as possible, and it was also essential that a 
fall-back political strategy was evolved that could achieve the 
same objective as was sought through the military campaign.

He reaffirmed his promise of holding elections to provincial and 
national assemblies in October 2002 in accordance with the roadmap 
announced by him last August "despite the prevailing environment in 
the region".

<a name="mili">Military debt falling</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Nov 15: Pakistan's military debt is showing a steady 
decline in last four years in actual amount and also as a ratio 
against total external liabilities indicating that government is 
servicing its defence liabilities regularly.

>From $1,006 million in fiscal 1998, Pakistan's military debt has 
been provisionally estimated at $825 million in fiscal year 01 by 
the State Bank of Pakistan in its annual report of 2000-2001 
released late last month.

In fact it was SBP's annual report of 1999-00 released in first 
week of November last year that revealed for the first time in 
history Pakistan's military debt amounting to $958 million, which 
was 3.53 per cent of $27.65 billion of public and publicly 
guaranteed debt.

In last one year, the government has paid $133 million to bring 
down the outstanding military debt from $958 to $825 million. Its 
ratio against public and publicly guaranteed debt has come down to 
3.1 per cent.

Pakistan's outstanding military debt in 1999 fiscal year was $1,004 
million, which was 3.73 per cent of total $26,904 million debt. In 
1998 the military debt was $1,006 million and was 3.79 per cent of 
the total debt.

The SBP report is silent on the source from where military debts 
have been obtained and does not provide any information on its 
terms and rate of returns.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 14: Asif Ali Zardari dispelled reports that the PPP 
has struck a deal with the military government. Talking to 
reporters at an accountability court, he asked the government to 
immediately hold general elections as only a civilian government 
could handle the situation in the post-Taliban era.

On Wednesday, two corruption references, the ARY gold and the SGS 
pre-shipment inspection award cases, were fixed. The cases were 
adjourned for Nov 27 and Nov 29 respectively without any hearing on 
the request of the prosecutor general, who could not appear before 
the court.

Mr Zardari said he would not repeat the mistake which former prime 
minister had committed by leaving the country. He said he would 
face the situation. He said former prime minister Benazir Bhutto 
was serving the interests of the country abroad in a better way.

When asked to suggest when Ms Bhutto was likely to return after the 
reported understanding between the PPP and the government, he said: 
"Ultimately she has to come to Pakistan as she belongs here. She 
will be in the country the moment the situation becomes conducive 
for her arrival in Pakistan."

He was of the view that the situation in Afghanistan was very 
fluid, the fallout of which in Pakistan could only be handled 
appropriately by a political government. Therefore, the government 
should hold elections as early as possible, he suggested.

petition of Asif Ali Zardari, demanding that his cases be shifted 
from Attock to Rawalpindi, and the order of shifting him to 
Karachi, after three months stay in Islamabad, should be reviewed

Muhammad Ajmal and Justice Syed Deedar Hussain Shah, after hearing 
Raja Mohammad Anwar, Farooq H. Naek, counsel for the petitioner and 
Raja Mohammad Bashir, prosecutor-general accountability, reserved

<a name="maul">Maulana Sami put under house arrest</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Nov 10: The chairman of Pakistan-Afghanistan Defence 
Council, Maulana Samiul Haq, was put under house arrest to prevent 
him rousing unrest against the government.

"Police have directed me not to leave my home," he told AFP by 
telephone from his home town of Akora Khattak. "They have 
surrounded my house and no one is allowed to go out. This is sheer 
injustice."

Police said they were acting on orders to prevent the religious 
leader from entering Punjab to plan protests against Pakistan's 
support for the US military campaign against the Taliban.

The chairman of the PADC, Samiul Haq, is a vocal supporter of the 
Taliban militia.

Maulan Sami said his son, Hamid ul Haq Haqqani, had also been 
arrested under laws which allow the detention of people suspected 
of plotting unrest. The move came ahead of the council's eight-
member central committee meeting scheduled in Islamabad on Saturday 
to discuss nationwide anti-US protests. Party members said the 
meeting had been cancelled.-AFP

Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 12 : Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has 
expressed concern over the expulsion of a British journalist 
Christina Lamb and her colleague.

In a statement issued here she called upon the government to review 
its decision. Ms Bhutto noted that Ms Lamb denied the press story 
that she tried to buy a plane ticket in the name of Osama Bin 
Laden. 

She said she was shocked to learn that Ms Lamb and her colleague 
were woken up in the early hours and taken away without being able 
to contact anyone. They were also kept awake for two nights without 
water. She said, "this is terrifying experience for ordinary 
Pakistanis and all the more for foreigners used to a different 
culture".

Ms Bhutto said, "Islamabad needs to do all it can to improve the 
country's image by acting in a humane manner. It can start by 
reviewing its action against Ms Lamb and her colleague".

<a name="ussi">Pakistan, US sign $600m agreement</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Nov 15: Pakistan and the United States signed an 
agreement under which Washington would provide $600 million in 
direct budget and balance-of-payments support to Islamabad. 
Agreement to this effect was signed here by Economic Affairs 
Division Secretary Nawid Ahsan and US Ambassador to Pakistan Wendy 
Chamberlin. 

The ambassador also detailed the "billion dollar plus" package for 
the people of Pakistan. She said that President George W. Bush had 
announced an over $1 billion aid package for the people of 
Pakistan.

Today, the ambassador said, they signed a memorandum of agreement 
to provide an important piece for that "one billion dollar plus" 
package. "It is $600 million and over Rs36 billion in grant aid," 
she added.

The ambassador elaborated that it was a grant aid for direct budget 
and balance-of-payments support to assist Pakistan in its foreign 
exchange needs, adding the US was helping Pakistan to get out of 
its debt trap and "we are encouraging others in the Paris Club to 
do the same".

Ms Chamberlin said that Rs36 billion would help Pakistan in its 
social sector priorities, including education, job creations and 
health. She said the aid was being provided to support the 
government's reform agenda and to mitigate the impact of the 
economic downturn on the Pakistan economy.

In addition to $600 million, the ambassador said the US had also 
agreed to provide the following bilateral assistance to Pakistan:

* $73 million in border security funds to assist federal, 
provincial and district governments in controlling Pakistan's long 
border.

* A $300 million line of credit for investment promotion from the 
Overseas Private Investment Corporation. And an unspecified amount 
from the US Export-Import Bank.

* $30 million in section 416 (b) soybeans and soybean oil.

* $17.4 million in ongoing support to the NGOs involved in 
education, health, women's empowerment and micro-finance.

* $15 million in refugee assistance in Pakistan.

* $3.1 million on child labour eradication programme in the soccer 
ball and carpet weaving industries.

* $2.8 million in direct support to education.

* $1.8 million to support democracy and governance programmes 
through NGOs.

* $34 million in ongoing counter-narcotics programmes.

* $6.5 million in anti-terrorism interdiction training programme.

* $150,000 to local NGOs for education, health and local government 
empowerment under the Democracy Small Grants Programme.

The ambassador said that her government had made plans to increase 
US development assistance, including the opening of a USAID mission 
to Pakistan. The mission will focus on education and health 
programmes at the district level. In addition, she said the US 
government had also taken the following steps to support Pakistan:

* On Sept 24, an agreement was signed to reschedule $379 million in 
government-to-government debt owed by Pakistan to the United 
States.

* All US nuclear, military takeover and debt sanctions were 
withdrawn as of Oct 20, permitting the resumption in bilateral 
support to Pakistan.

* The US committed to support an IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth 
Facility for Pakistan.

* The US supports an additional rescheduling of Pakistan's 
bilateral debt at the up-coming Paris Club meeting.

Mr Aziz thanked the US for providing over $1 billion economic 
assistance to Pakistan for the development of social sector, 
poverty reduction, human resource development and reducing debt 
burden. He hoped that the Pakistan-US relationship would be 
strengthened.-APP

<a name="govt">Govt to transfer its WAPDA assets</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Khaleeq Kiani

ISLAMABAD, Nov 11: The government has decided to transfer its 100 
per cent assets and ownership in WAPDA to 12 corporate companies 
through a presidential ordinance.

Official sources told Dawn that the change of titles (commonly 
called "Transfer of Titles" in the official jargon) through the 
ordinance would enable the government to shift its ownership 
automatically to 12 corporate companies without going into the 
technical nitty-gritty.

The proposal has come from the World Bank that is co- financing a 
$1 billion power sector restructuring and corporatization plan to 
unbundle the multi-billion-rupee 'Residual WAPDA' into 12 corporate 
companies and their subsequent privatisation, these sources said.

The steering committee on the restructuring of WAPDA is expected to 
meet soon in the ministry of finance on the subject, Mirza Hamid 
Hassan, Secretary Water and Power confirmed to Dawn .

Official sources said that a draft ordinance was in the process of 
vetting and expected to be promulgated sometime next month 
following approval by the cabinet by the end of this month.

The World Bank suggested transfer of titles through an ordinance, 
instead of an executive order, as the mechanism was used 
successfully in some other countries, WAPDA's Member (finance), 
Manzoor Shaikh said.

The valuation of WAPDA assets like real estate, machinery, 
investments, life of the plants and buildings on the basis of book 
value is already under way but this would not form basis for 
pricing at the time of privatisation, official sources said.

WAPDA's shares were transferred in the name of president of 
Pakistan/Pakistan Electric Power Company last year from WAPDA 
itself following a number of reminders from the World Bank for 
onward transfer to Pakistan Electric Power Company (Pepco), the 
holding company responsible for corporatization of WAPDA.

The unbundled corporate companies include eight distribution 
companies (Discos), three generation companies (Gencos) and a 
National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) and have been 
registered independently under the Companies Ordinance, 1984.

These sources said that transfer pricing and financial modelling 
exercise has been completed by WAPDA and discussed with the WB but 
the two issues were required to be finalized and approved by the 
National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).

Another reform measure that was still behind schedule related to 
completion of distribution and generation licences to the corporate 
companies that has now just started.

These sources said that once Nepra completed the licensing process 
the final mechanism for transfer pricing would emerge and then 
approved by the Nepra. The financial modelling of corporate 
companies is required to be completed by December 31, 2001, they 
said.

These sources said that the question relating to exemption of WAPDA 
companies from provincial taxes had been agreed to with the 
provincial authorities against some adjustments in tariffs but a 
notification to that effect had not been issued due to some legal 
complications.

On federal tax exemptions, said the sources, the finance minister 
has informed WAPDA in no uncertain terms that the days of tax 
exemptions were gone and hence the corporate companies must reduce 
their losses to cover the fiscal gap.

The WAPDA has, however, told the government that if income tax 
exemptions were not granted, the majority of the Discos and Gencos 
would be filing no returns because they did not earn profits at 
all. Consequently, the interim order by the chief executive 
relating to withholding tax has also been put on hold, these 
sources said.

As things stand now, notification on provincial tax exemptions, 
federal tax exemptions, particularly the income tax and the 
withholding tax, transfer of WAPDA employees to Discos and Gencos 
and transfer of assets, were some of the requirements that are 
still either in the process or behind the schedule agreed with the 
World Bank, the WAPDA sources confirmed.

<a name="figh">Pakistan fighting for concessions on textiles</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shadaba Islam

DOHA, Nov 12: The developing nations including Pakistan were 
fighting hard to secure key concessions on textiles, anti-dumping 
rules and agriculture as a World Trade Organization meeting in Doha 
entered a crucial last stretch.

As delegates reported a near-deal on developing countries' access 
to medicines, WTO director general Mike Moore urged participants to 
start preparing to "give and take" on plans to launch a new global 
trade round.

"We are close but there are still areas of substantial 
differences," Moore told reporters.

WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said ministers and their aides were 
rolling up their sleeves to thrash out an accord before midnight on 
Nov 13, the deadline for ending the meeting.

But he said apart from the drugs patent issue, little progress had 
been made on questions covering speedier liberalization of textile 
quotas, phasing out of European farm subsidies and demands from 
developing countries, Japan and Korea for changes in WTO rules on 
punishing the dumping of goods.

The problem was that countries were linking concessions made in one 
area to those in other unrelated sectors, Rockwell said.

The deal on drugs was still being opposed by India.

<a name="cred">Creditors to bridge $3.2bn financing gap</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 14: Pakistan's $3.2 billion financing gap for 2001-
2002 will be jointly bridged by the IMF-led bilateral and 
multilateral creditors and a decision in this respect is expected 
to be taken by the Fund's executive board in the first week of 
December.

Pakistan has been assured by the United States that its $8 billion 
financing gap during the next three year period will be met by 
bilateral and multilateral donors, official sources told Dawn.

Pakistan was told that since it offered necessary support to US-led 
coalition to fight against terrorism, Islamabad's short- and long-
term financial requirements will be adequately met. And in the 
first place, Pakistan's current year $3.2 billion financing gap 
will be filled to ease pressure on its balance of payment position.

The IMF's new Senior Representative in Pakistan Mr Henri 
Ghesquiere, when contacted, confirmed to Dawn that Fund's executive 
board was meeting in Washington on Dec 5 or 6 to discuss and 
approve Pakistan's estimated $3.2 billion financing gap for the 
current financial year.

"Pakistan's economic and financial needs are required to be met and 
its case for approval of $3.2 billion financing gap for the current 
fiscal is bright," he said. He pointed out that IMF and other 
bilateral and multilateral donors were greatly encouraged by the 
successful completion of the 10-month Standby Arrangement (SBA). 
"The executive board of the IMF has been encouraged to see good 
economic performance shown by Pakistan under SBA programme," he 
added.

"Pakistan has a good argument for trying to persuade the creditors 
for a certain extent of debt forgiveness."

Mr Ghesquiere said that Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) 
will also come up for discussion by the board. However, he made it 
clear that nothing could be said about the size of the new lending 
program. But he said that new lending program will be concessional 
one to help improve the economy of the country. Pakistan, he said, 
was so indebted that it needed to be offered new loans on maximum 
0.5 per cent interest rate.

Official sources said that $3.2 billion financing gap was likely to 
include $700 million loans to be restructured by the Paris Club for 
the current financial year.

The Club was expected to meet immediately after IMF executive 
board's meeting.

Sources said that while the IMF, Paris Club and other bilateral and 
multilateral donors were working out details to offer substantial 
assistance to Pakistan, they wanted improvements in various 
sectors. For example, they were of the view that issues like 
corruption, good governance, transparency and provisions for more 
funding for health and education sectors were needed to be taken 
seriously by the government.

The United States has just promised $1 billion assistance of which 
$600 million will be in the shape of budgetary support. Also, 
Pakistan was promised market access in the United States and a 
better financial package by the IMF, World Bank, Asian Development 
Bank and other bilateral creditors.

Washington had also approved $600 million cash grant for Pakistan 
but so far nothing has flowed into the kitty.

Earlier, the UK had written off Pakistan's $40 million loans while 
Canada converted its $300 million debt into social sector funding 
through a swap. European Union (EU) had also offered additional 
market access which according to the officials concerned was likely 
to provide $400 million additional relief during the current 
financial year.

<a name="inde">Index gains 9.11 points as brisk trading continues</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 16: The KSE-100 index gained another 9.11 points to 
close at 1,380.71 points.

Key market heavy weights like PTCL had announced strong results and 
lately the Sui twins had surprised investors with dividend 
announcements after nine blank years.

The other major reason that had buoyed sentiments at the market 
enabling it to breach the 1,375 key level. The mounting of 
Pakistan's liquid foreign exchange reserves to $3.62 billion as of 
November 10 and the reduction in prices of all petroleum products, 
including the HSD and Motor Gasoline, were also encouraging to 
investors.

In the heat of the moment, not much notice was taken of the World 
Bank's forecast of Pakistan's GDP growth to just 3 per cent for the 
current year and Rs6.6 billion shortfall in revenue receipts for 
the first four months (July-October) of the current year; actual 
collections being Rs110.7 billion against the target of Rs117.3 
billion.

But for all that, many analysts are hinting at resistance once the 
index touches the 1400 level, albeit some stock traders, including 
those at First Capital suggest the downside could be limited. 
"Technical indicators i.e. Momentum and RSI are showing positive 
trend", First Capital said on Friday morning.

Volume of business on Friday hit 122 million shares, up from 98 
million shares a day earlier. Among the 174 total actives; the 
ratio of plus to minus was 2:1.

The pharmaceutical firm, Wyeth Pakistan, posted the day's biggest 
gain of Rs45 with the stock closing at Rs295. It was followed by 
Bhanero Textile up Rs5 to Rs65. Among the largest losers for the 
day were Colgate Pakistan, down Rs4.90 to Rs93.60 and Shell 
Pakistan lower by Rs3.90 to Rs180.10.

Hub Power Company gained another 45 paisa to close at Rs19.60 with 
the largest volume of 46.259 million shares. PTCL was the second 
most traded scrip, posting 20 paisa gain to end the day at Rs18.10 
on 30.945 million shares. Sui Northern was down 5 paisa to Rs11.70 
on 8.659 million shares, the stock shedding a bit of the gains made 
earlier on distribution of dividend. ICI posted an increase of 
Rs1.45 to Rs47.25 on 8.112 million shares. Fauji Fertiliser saw 
trading in 4.351 million shares, which finished at the last close 
of Rs41.40. MCB was down 10 paisa to Rs23.80 on a business in 2.949 
million shares. Nishat Mills was up 10 paisa to Rs16.60 on 2.739 
million shares; D.G. Khan Cement gained 60 paisa to Rs6.35 on 2.725 
million shares.

FUTURE CONTRACTS: On the Futures counter nine scrip came up for 
trading with 6 in the plus and 3 in minus. Hub Power was the volume 
leader again with 1.770 million shares finishing up 45 paisa to 
Rs19.70. PTCL gained 20 paisa to close at Rs18.15 with business in 
0.779 million shares; Engro Chemicals closed flat at Rs55.80 with 
0.083 million shares; Sui Northern Gas also closed unchanged at 
Rs11.80 on 0.063 million shares and the oil marketing company, PSO, 
was up 25 paisa to Rs93.25 on 0.059 million shares.

DIVIDEND: Trust Modaraba omitted payout for the year ended June 30, 
2001; Good Luck Industries proposed dividend at 20 per cent and 
Karam Ceramics recommended dividend at 15 per cent. The Board of 
Directors of Metropolitan Life Assurance Co resolved to pay 5 per

<a name="home">Homegrown terrorism</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

Since I wrote last week, Bagh-i-Rustom has lost its illustrious 
neighbours. The consulate-general of the Islamic Emirate of 
Afghanistan with its huge mosque and its adjacent comfortable 
living quarters lies sealed and shut.

The consulate itself is quite incongruous with what we are told 
about the poor Taliban who have no money for their country or for 
their people - its floors and walls are of marble imported from 
Afghanistan. As it is with our country, one must suppose, the 
Afghan people starve and shiver whilst the rulers dwell in halls of 
marble.

The last conversation with Consul-General Maulvi Rahmatullah 
Kakazada was memorable. "We are warriors of God and Islam" he told 
me. "But," I responded, "He neither enlists nor recruits armies and 
does not believe in conscription. He does not command anyone to go 
to war, to kill in His name, or to be killed in His name. He tells 
us that life is His gift to us, to be lived to the full, and to do 
as much good as we can whilst in this world."

His response : "Well, if I go on jihad and fight and die in the 
name of Islam I know I will go straight to heaven. Otherwise, if I 
do not, I can live my life doing what I can without knowing whether 
I will ever get there or not." "You might get a safe passage, but 
what about your wife and children and other dependents?" I asked. 
"No problem," he said, "my wife and children will be looked after. 
They will mourn for three days and on the fourth day, because of my 
good deeds, my wife will find a better husband and my children a 
better protector."

This sound madrassah logic is what George Bush is waging war 
against with his bombs. Kakazada's parting request: "Our brothers 
across the Gulf have sent us 80 tonnes of dates in six containers 
which arrived at Karachi port on July 25 on one of our brothers' 
vessels, the Al-Manakh. We are unable to clear the consignment for 
want of funds. Can you help me get the port charges and demurrage 
waived and somehow arrange to have the dates sent to Afghanistan 
for our starving people?"

Marble - demurrage ?

All that could be done, I told him, was to seek help from one of 
the Taliban godfathers, General Javed Ashraf Qazi , a former chief 
of ISI and now our minister for ports and (no) shipping.. Could 
someone reading this in Islamabad bring the matter of Kakazada's 
plight to the notice of the able communications general. Some 
150,000 lbs of dates will sustain many a life for many a day.

One advantage of Bush's war, so far, has been that our homegrown 
terrorists are creeping out of the woodwork and making conciliatory 
noises. They know that an act of terrorism is a criminal offence to 
which the statute of limitation does not apply. It is amusing to 
now hear all, repeat all, our past political stalwarts who have 
actively and knowingly committed or aided and abetted acts of 
terrorism.

A PPP - obviously uneducated - former minister, Manzoor Hussain 
Wassan, chosen by our freely and fairly elected democratic prime 
minister Benazir Bhutto in 1989 to be her minister for transport in 
her own province of Sindh, once terrorized the secretary of his 
ministry. Zubair Kidwai, operated strictly and correctly by law and 
procedure, and when overruled by the minister in his own and his 
party's interest, made no objections.

But Wassan was not content with merely overruling Kidwai ; he 
wanted him to put his signature to the flouting of the law. This 
Kidwai did object to. So, the minister summoned his secretary and 
the managing-director of the Karachi Transport Corporation. They 
arrived in his conference room into which then entered the minister 
accompanied by two personal armed guards, his private secretary and 
a peon. One gunman was posted by the door, and the other at the 
seated Kidwai's back.

Wassan berated Kidwai for failing to carry out his orders, be they 
illegal or legal, and assured him that he had 'other means' to use 
to get things done in his department according to his wishes and 
desires. Shouting, he told them that rules and regulations were for 
the birds, as was any reference to the chief minister. Wassan made 
it quite clear to Kidwai, with the gunman behind him, that he knew 
how to get officers such as he to perform, and using his own 
particular methods would ensure that he and the KTC MD were not 
transferred and were forced to carry out his orders blindly.

When Kidwai asked him politely not to shout he was told to 'shut 
up'. When he then rose from his chair and asked if he could leave 
the room, the man at his back with one hand poked him with his gun 
barrel, with the other pushed him down by the shoulder, and told 
him to remain seated. Wassan continued his tirade by informing 
Kidwai that he knew that even if transferred, Kidwai and his family 
would remain in Karachi and that Wassan had ways of 'fixing' (a 
favourite PPP word) them even when out of his ministry. Kidwai was 
then told to 'get out'.

Now, after eleven years, Wassan writes a letter to Dawn ('PPP 
leader's version', October 31) and asks for proof of what he did. 
The matter is on record at the Sindh secretariat and all Wassan has 
to do is to refer to a note written by the then chief secretary, 
Abdul Karim Lodhi, to the PPP chief minister, Aftab Shahban Mirani. 
Will this satisfy him?

Lodhi asked Mirani to immediately issue notice to his ministers and 
other party members, instructing them "....that no one shall cause 
fire arms or any other weapons to be carried into the office rooms. 
If anybody does so, from now onwards, Sir, with due respect, one 
will have to order the physical removal from the secretariat of 
both the minister and his companions bearing arms. The government 
has provided adequate police security in the secretariat. If that 
is not considered enough by anybody, it cannot be supplemented by 
ruffians....

"Now, reverting to the ugly incident, Sir, it so happens that both 
the affected officers have a known reputation for uprightness, 
competence and integrity. One wonders if anything similar can be 
used to describe the errant minister..... Mr Manzoor Wassan should 
personally apologize to both officers, preferably in the presence 
of his private secretary and the two guards (of course, minus their 
weapons)......".

Before Mrs Nasreen Jalil, the resident chief of the MQM, jumps the 
gun and writes a letter to the press, for her information and 
according to police records, there are 260 criminal cases, many 
involving acts of terrorism, pending/decided here in Pakistan 
against her party chief Altaf Hussain, who fled the country and is 
now in residence in London with a British passport in his pocket. 
In one case, FIR 211/91 of 24/6/91, filed by Major Kalimuddin in 
Landhi police station, Altaf Bhai and six others were awarded 27 
years RI by the special terrorist court. Tony Blair has given him 
asylum and by making him a British citizen has afforded him 
protection. But brother Altaf should realize that Blair is a far 
cry from Palmerston.

If this newspaper is to be believed, the PPP and General Pervez 
Musharraf's government are very close to finalizing a deal (front 
page report, November 9). Asif Zardari is in custody facing four 
cases involving terrorism and murder.

Terrorism will not be eliminated in Pakistan as long as our 
politicians and the vast majority of the people remain uneducated 
and bigoted. However, in the meantime, will someone - the 
honourable minister, the United Nations chief in the country, the 
ambassador of the US, or some other good man of God save Kakazada's 
dates. They are rotting, or sprouting roots, in their containers at 
Karachi.

<a name="whyb">Why bomb civilians?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Eric S. Margolis

The 21st century went to war against the 11th Century in 
Afghanistan last week. The 11th century won.

US warplanes cluster-bombed the usual natives, but the intensive 
air attacks failed to dislodge Taliban tribal warriors from 
positions north of Kabul.

Osama bin Laden was not found. Hundreds of Afghan civilians were 
killed by off-target American bombs. The Red Cross in Kabul was hit 
for a second time. US aircraft attempted to assassinate Mulla Omar, 
Taliban's leader, but failed and killed his young son and two 
brothers. A major, 100-man US commando raid was a failure. Taliban 
very likely shot down a US helicopter.

Mass defections from Taliban predicted by Washington's 'experts, 
didn't happen. Afghans flocked to join Taliban. Thousands of Pahtun 
tribesmen from Pakistan crossed into Afghanistan over the fabled 
Malakand Pass to fight the American invaders.

In this same region during the early 20th century, British colonial 
troops battled two notorious Islamic devils, the Osama bin Ladens 
of their day: the ferocious but elusive Fakir of Ipi, and that 
scourge of Victorian imperialism, the 'Mad Mullah,' who led 20,000 
wild Pashtun holy warriors down the Malakand to drive the infidel 
'farangi' from Peshawar and the lands of Islam. Peshawar was only 
saved by British warplanes and artillery.

America's new Afghan allies, the Northern Alliance, a motley, 
Russian-created force of former communists, opium dealers, bandits, 
and unwarlike tribesmen, struck ferocious poses for gullible 
western TV teams, but failed to advance an inch. Meanwhile, the US 
bombing of Afghanistan's main cities created many thousands more 
refugees at a time when four million Afghans are starving.

Not exactly a proud week for American arms. Operation Ultimate 
Hubris was off to a poor start.

At the Pentagon, spokesman Rear Admiral John Stufflebeem admitted 
with exasperation that Taliban "are proving to be tough warriors." 
Arrogance and ignorance are a deadly combination. Unfortunately, 
they are often hallmarks of US foreign policy. The Pentagon brass 
and President George Bush should have read a book about Afghanistan 
before launching a war against a fierce nation about which few in 
Washington know anything.

Blinded by rage and the need to avenge the frightful crimes 
committed on September 11, the US charged into Afghanistan with no 
plan of action, and no exit strategy. Washington has every right to 
bring terrorists to justice through police and intelligence 
operations. But not to launch a general war against Afghans who had 
nothing to do with attacks on America.

Who will replace Taliban? The Northern Alliance's Uzbeks, Tajiks, 
and Hazaras are feuding. When Tajik forces last ruled Kabul, they 
battled Uzbeks and Pashtuns, killed tens of thousands of civilians, 
and left the city in ruins. The late Tajik warlord, dashing Ahmad 
Masoud, assassinated on Sept. 9, was fawned on by the western media 
and hailed as 'the lion of Panjsher.' If he was the Lion of 
Panjsher, then I'm the Lion of Kabul. Masoud was hated by most non-
Tajik Afghans as a traitor and long-time collaborator with the 
Soviets, Russians, and KGB. I recall vividly when he abandoned the 
jihad and went over to the Soviets.

The Uzbek leader, Rashid Dostum, a former communist warlord, is a 
blood-thirsty criminal, mass murderer, and Washington's new best 
friend. Dostum unleashed his feared Uzbek-Mongol 'jawzjani' militia 
against Kabul in an orgy of slaughter, pillage and mass rape.

Washington's main Pashtun ally, Abdul Haq, was captured by Taliban 
last week and promptly executed.

To end the rapine and chaos, Pakistani intelligence helped create a 
force of religious seminarians, or Talibs, many of them orphans 
left from the struggle against Soviet occupation that killed 1.5 
million Afghans. Taliban defeated the Northern Alliance and brought 
order - albeit a harsh, medieval order, to Afghanistan - but a 
traditional tribal order no different from the rest of Afghanistan, 
and many parts of Iran, Pakistan, and rural India.

Taliban will probably be driven from Kabul. But Taliban represents 
Pashtuns, half the nation's population. The Talibs vow to fight 
from the mountains, and I certainly believe them. Who will keep a 
pro-US, pro-Russian regime in power in Kabul? American troops will 
likely be required. How will the American garrison be supplied? 
Just like the imperial British invaders, who were twice defeated by 
the Afghans, US forces will have to rely on vulnerable land supply 
lines at great distances from their depots that cross narrow 
mountain passes.

The other alternative, air supply of an American garrison in Kabul, 
is a recipe for a Dienbienphu-like disaster. The Soviet Red Army 
tried everything from carpet bombing to poison gas and biological 
warfare to break the Afghans, but failed. Soviet garrisons were 
isolated and chewed up, one by one. I was in the field with Pashtun 
warriors who were so poor they could not afford shoes. These 
Mujahideen walked barefoot ten miles through deep mountain snow 
with 100 lbs of mortar shells on their backs, fired them at a 
Soviet base, and trekked back under air attack.I suggest the good 
Adm. Stuffelbeam go read Kipling's warning to British troops trying 
to fight their way through ferocious Afridi tribesmen guarding the 
Khyber Pass: "Save your last bullet for yourself."

As it becomes increasingly evident the Sept 11 attacks were planned 
in Egypt and Germany, and delivered by Saudis, America's laying of 
fire and sword on Afghanistan makes less and less sense. The US 
should declare victory and decamp from Afghanistan, Pakistan and 
Central Asia before it gets stuck in an aimless, endless war.-

<a name="redc">Pakistan's red carpet fraying at the edges</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

The rout of the Taliban and the fall of Kabul to the Northern 
Alliance has demolished a few cherished myths and put a sudden 
circle around Pakistan's importance as a staging post for the 
American war on Afghanistan.

Far from Afghanistan turning into a Vietnam for the United States, 
US military strategy there stands resoundingly vindicated. No 
argument being more powerful than success or victory, the Taliban 
rout which began from the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif and soon spread to 
Kabul lays to rest all the doubts raised in the last week or so 
about the effectiveness of the American approach to the war.

Now of course all the pundits will say that they had seen what was 
coming. But this would be wisdom after the event. Only a few days 
ago such a swift Taliban collapse was not anticipated. Nor is this 
a regrouping or tactical withdrawal for a wider guerilla war. This 
line in consolation hardly fits the facts on the ground.

The truth is the Taliban have been beaten. The truth also is that 
the American military doctrine, first crafted during the Gulf War, 
and much later re-tested in Serbia, has come out on top again. The 
two key principles of this doctrine are: (1) strike from the air 
and avoid a ground war - unless of course your enemy has been 
reduced to pulp; and (2) always choose an enemy who cannot hit 
back. It's like a heavyweight always choosing featherweight 
opponents. Not much chance of the heavyweight ever being beaten.

*From the application of this doctrine, however, another lesson also 
flows: featherweights should not go out of their way to pick fights 
beyond their class. If there is no chivalry in taking out and 
slamming weak opponents - and then taking credit for one's military 
prowess - there is no wisdom in quixotic gallantry. Let the next 
Saddam Hussein, Milosevic or Mulla Omar remember this.

A thought might be spared though for Pakistan's predicament. Having 
gone out on a limb to support the American war effort, it should 
have been happy at coming out on the right side of victory. But 
with the Northern Alliance entering Kabul, thus confirming one of 
the ISI's worst nightmares, the mood in Islamabad is anything but 
celebratory.

Overestimating our importance (a weakness to which we are ever 
prone), we had convinced ourselves that our frontline status gave 
us a virtual veto over the shape of things to come in Afghanistan. 
If not that, then at least our objections regarding the Northern 
Alliance would be respected.

We forgot that the Americans were working to a different deadline. 
They wanted visible gains on the ground to offset growing criticism 
that the war was going nowhere. If for this they had needed the 
devil, they would have used him. Now that events have moved too 
fast for our calculations, and the Taliban have proved less 
stubborn in resistance than the gathering mythology about their 
hardihood had led many armchair strategists to believe, Pakistan is 
reduced to delivering dire warnings of further strife in 
Afghanistan.

Let us express our fears by all means. But with no leverage to back 
up our warnings, we only underline our impotence by crying out loud 
about something not in our power to change. Indeed our petulance on 
this score makes it appear as if it is we who have been defeated 
rather than the Taliban.

At the root of our distress lies our strange obsession with 
Afghanistan. For full 20 years we have meddled in its affairs in 
pursuit of the elusive dream of 'strategic depth' and a permanently 
friendly regime in that country. The turnaround in our Afghan 
policy forced upon us by the events of September 11 should have 
cured us of this delusion. But as the anguished hand-wringing in 
Islamabad clearly shows, old habits die hard.

Why don't we leave Afghanistan alone? Geography dictated Pakistan's 
importance for the US attacks on Afghanistan. Geography dictates a 
working relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan, no matter 
what regime - communist, Taliban, Tajik or Hazara - holds sway 
there. Why shouldn't we be content with this? Why should we insist 
on playing the role of king-maker in a land which has made nonsense 
of all our attempts at dictation?

After September 11 many Americans asked why the US was so hated in 
parts of the Muslim world. We should ask ourselves why we have come 
to be so hated by the Afghans. Too much interference is not a good 
thing.

We need to get our thinking right on a whole range of issues. We 
magnified the importance of our role in Afghanistan in the 1980s 
and there is a danger we may have done so again. We were vital for 
the Americans from the moment preparations for a strike on 
Afghanistan began until the moment Kabul fell on November 13 - two 
heady months during which Pakistan was the centre of global 
attention and General Musharraf the most sought-after leader in the 
world. But with the military situation having dramatically changed, 
Pakistan's importance as a front-line state has also rapidly 
altered. Our airspace and bases were crucial before November 13. 
Now the Americans have a whole range of other options.

Whether we played our cards as deftly as we might have is now a 
lost debate. It is worth recalling, however, that Hosni Mubarak of 
Egypt got loans worth 9 billion dollars written off during the Gulf 
war. We have got much less for our pains. In the days and months 
ahead we will have plenty of time to judge whether by showing more 
resolve we could have struck a better deal. But this is water under 
the bridge. We will not get the dollars we imagined or secure the 
debt write-offs we thought would lighten our economic burden. Even 
so, other, and perhaps more important, opportunities beckon whose 
existence only blind foolishness can ignore.

For 20 years - that is, since Ziaul Haq's time - Pakistan has been 
in the grip of state fundamentalism: a mindset manifested in (1) 
our pursuit of nuclear status; (2) our obsession with Afghanistan; 
and (3) our attitude to Kashmir. At the altar of these sacred 
shibboleths all other aspects of national life, including democracy 
and sound economics, have been sacrificed.

It is instructive to recall that when justifying Pakistan's joining 
the US war effort, among the four reasons General Musharraf cited, 
two related to protecting the Kashmir cause and our 'nuclear 
assets', the irony no doubt being lost on him that supposedly our 
greatest strength had turned in a moment of danger into our biggest 
weakness.

At long last we have a chance to give Pakistan a new direction so 
that it looks ahead instead of back. We have a chance to cure the 
Pakistani state of its delusions of persecution and grandeur. The 
world is not out to get us (persecution). Nor are we a fortress of 
Islam destined to fulfil messianic dreams (grandeur).

This does not mean we resile from our stand on Kashmir. But we must 
recognize that after Afghanistan the freedom struggle in Kashmir is 
bound to come under greater American scrutiny. In the new global 
climate now forming there will be less patience for such extra-
territorial organizations as Lashkar-i-Taiba and Jaish-i-Muhammad.

We do not even have the courage of Lebanon - a country onefortieth 
our size - which has firmly told the US that there is no question 
of blocking the funds of Hezbollah and Amal because both are 
engaged in a legitimate resistance struggle. So how best to support 
the Kashmir cause? By letting the Kashmiris carry on their own 
struggle or by raising the flag of militancy within Pakistan? 
Sooner rather that later we will have to answer this question. 

But let's not kid ourselves. Pakistan will not change direction 
unless the army redefines its national role. If it insists on the 
driver's seat, and if every now and then half-baked nostrums of 
reform are thrust down the nation's throat, Pakistan will know 
neither stability nor progress. Our last Afghan involvement forged 
an alliance between the army and the most reactionary sections of 
Pakistani society. Out of the chaos and confusion of the present 
involvement must arise a new partnership between the army and 
democracy if we are to say we have gained anything from this 
experience.

But if General Musharraf, on whose shoulders so much rests, sticks 
to that doctored version of democracy a glimpse of which he 
provided to NBC TV - 'that elections will be held but I will remain 
president' - then the question arises whether Pakistan is at all 
capable of learning from its mistakes.

<a name="zero">Zero-sum games people play</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

I often get e-mails from Indian readers complaining of what they 
perceive as a preoccupation with India in the Pakistani press. "Why 
can't your papers get over your anti-India fixation?" they ask.

Having just returned after a stimulating week in Delhi, I can 
safely inform them that this Pakistani hang-up is mirrored in 
India. Regular readers of this column will know that I have no axe 
to grind, no line to peddle; above all, I am not rabidly against 
things Indian. However, I was struck by how much space is devoted 
to Pakistan, and, considering how little coverage was given to 
world affairs by even serious papers like The Times of India and 
The Hindu, the imbalance was even more surprising.

In particular, the concern about Pakistan cashing in on the Afghan 
crisis while India was left out verged on the hysterical. Although 
The Times of India carried an excellent editorial questioning the 
Indian governments' ardent desire to jump on to the anti-terrorist 
bandwagon, the news slant made it clear that the Pakistani edge in 
the current situation does not sit well with thinking Indians. Many 
Indian journalists contrast what they perceive as General 
Musharaf's brilliant footwork in capitalizing financially and 
diplomatically on Pakistan's proximity to Afghanistan during his 
trip to America with Mr Vajpayee's wooden performance there.

Above all, it is Kashmir that is the touchstone by which diplomatic 
success or failure is measured. During my week in India, each word 
uttered by Bush and Blair was analysed carefully for any pro-
Pakistan tilt. By the time Musharraf returned to Islamabad, there 
was an almost audible sigh of relief that, while the Pakistani 
leader might have brought back pledges of over a billion dollars 
with the possibility of more to follow, he had not managed to budge 
the American president on his hands-off policy on Kashmir.

On Afghanistan, there was a palpable air of self-congratulation 
over Pakistan's isolation in its efforts to induct 'moderate 
Taliban' in the new government in Kabul. I personally feel this 
attempt is doomed to failure, given that the taliban are now 
history (the Lord be thanked!). In any case, a 'moderate Taliban' 
is a contradiction in terms. But the glee evident in the Indian 
press over Pakistan's desperate efforts to have a major say in the 
post-Taliban dispensation was slightly nauseating.

For our part, we are certainly no better: every Indian reversal in 
any field is welcomed in our papers, while any success is met with 
ill-concealed envy. But it must be said that Pakistan has greater 
justification (if such puerile behaviour can be justified) for this 
fixation than India. After all, as the far smaller and weaker 
nation, we can perhaps be forgiven for our paranoia and our 
insecurity. But what excuse does India have? In my many discussions 
with Indian journalists and politicians, I made the point that, 
given their preponderance in just about every field, they could 
have afforded to take unilateral steps aimed at removing Pakistani 
suspicions and doubts.

Indeed, Indian pressure from 1948 onwards is partly to blame for 
the militarization of Pakistan, as the nascent state depended on 
western aid and our army to shield us from perceived Indian 
belligerence. The perception that the armed forces were our 
ultimate saviours made it possible for our generals to intervene at 
will, thus warping and deforming political development in Pakistan.

As a result of this mindless rivalry, we are now locked in a zero-
sum game in which both countries are forever trying to score points 
off each other, as the rest of the world races ahead, sniggering 
quietly while we indulge in schoolboy scraps. One nation's gain 
translates automatically into the other's loss and vice versa. In 
this unending rivalry, the only losers are the people on both 
sides, while their leaders use each other as scapegoats for their 
own failures. Indeed, had Kashmir not divided us, we would have 
probably invented some other cause to squabble over because, given 
the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the leadership in New 
Delhi and Islamabad, we can be pretty sure they would have been 
unable to solve the many pressing problems that beset both nations. 
Leaders on both sides need a convenient excuse to deflect criticism 
for their ineptitude.

But if our leaders display their immaturity and their lack of 
vision and imagination, why does the press pander to them? As 
journalists, surely our job is to deflate them and hold up a mirror 
to their many imperfections. However, during my all-too-brief 
sojourn in Delhi, I was struck and disturbed by the solid consensus 
in the press behind core government policies and positions. While I 
had noticed this phenomenon on private Indian TV channels, I was 
taken aback to see it on display in the mainstream newspapers as 
well. Whatever my Indian readers might say about the Pakistani 
preoccupation with India, these columns (as well as those in other 
newspapers here) are full of articles and editorials that question 
and criticize many fundamental government positions ranging from 
Kashmir to the nuclear program.

When General Musharraf expressed his annoyance at criticism in the 
Pakistani press, saying that this did not happen to the same extent 
in India, I thought he was exaggerating. But after my week-long 
scrutiny of Indian newspapers, I fear that he was not wide of the 
mark. When I discussed my perceptions with like-minded Indian 
journalists, they ascribed this malaise in the Indian print media 
to the price-war that has forced owners and editors to focus 
primarily on the bottom line: for instance, comment on the op-ed 
pages has been curtailed for reasons of ads. In Pakistan, there are 
mercifully no commercial announcements on these pages in this or 
any other paper. As a result, The Times of India sells for Rs 1.50. 
But this low price has meant that there is no editor of the paper, 
and nor are there any book reviews as the owners feel that the 
space could be put to more productive use by selling it to 
advertisers.

Despite the commercialization of many venerable Indian newspapers, 
many bright and talented journalists are fighting to preserve their 
integrity. Unfortunately, the policy of preventing Indian papers 
and periodicals from selling in Pakistan and vice versa has 
deprived us of gaining an insight into each other's thinking. 
Although the Internet has made it possible to bridge this gap, most 
journalists on both sides do not log on as often as they ought to. 
Meanwhile, our leaders continue to let us and themselves down 
through their futile rivalry.

<a name="terr">Terrorism is the symptom, not the disease </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Arundhati Roy

In 1979, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the CIA and 
Pakistan's ISI launched the largest covert operation in the history 
of the CIA. Their purpose was to harness the energy of Afghan 
resistance to the Soviets and expand it into a holy war, an Islamic 
jihad, which would turn Muslim countries within the Soviet Union 
against the communist regime and eventually destabilize it.

When it began, it was meant to be the Soviet Union's Vietnam. It 
turned out to be much more than that.

Over the years, through the ISI, the CIA funded and recruited 
almost 100,000 radical Mujahideen from 40 Islamic countries as 
soldiers for America's proxy war. The rank and file of the 
Mujahideen were unaware that their jihad was actually being fought 
on behalf of Uncle Sam. (The irony is that America was equally 
unaware that it was financing a future war against itself.)

In 1989, after being bloodied by 10 years of relentless conflict, 
the Russians withdrew, leaving behind a civilization reduced to 
rubble. Civil war in Afghanistan raged on. The jihad spread to 
Chechnya, Kosovo and eventually to Kashmir. The CIA continued to 
pour in money and military equipment, but the overheads had become 
immense, and more money was needed.

The Mujahideen ordered farmers to plant opium as a "revolutionary 
tax". The ISI set up hundreds of heroin laboratories across 
Afghanistan. Within two years of the CIA's arrival, the Pakistan-
Afghanistan borderland had become the biggest producer of heroin in 
the world, and the single biggest source of the heroin on American 
streets. The annual profits, said to be between $100bn and $200bn, 
were ploughed back into training and arming militants.

In 1995, the Taliban - then a marginal sect of dangerous, hard-line 
fundamentalists - fought its way to power in Afghanistan. It was 
funded by the ISI, that old cohort of the CIA, and supported by 
many political parties in Pakistan. The Taliban unleashed a regime 
of terror. Its first victims were its own people, particularly 
women. It closed down girls' schools, dismissed women from 
government jobs, and enforced sharia laws under which women deemed 
to be "immoral" are stoned to death, and widows guilty of being 
adulterous are buried alive. After all that has happened, can there 
be anything more ironic than Russia and America joining hands to 
re-destroy Afghanistan? The question is, can you destroy 
destruction? Dropping more bombs on Afghanistan will only shuffle 
the rubble, scramble some old graves and disturb the dead. The 
desolate landscape of Afghanistan was the burial ground of Soviet 
communism and the springboard of a unipolar world dominated by 
America. It made the space for neocapitalism and corporate 
globalization, again dominated by America. And now Afghanistan is 
poised to become the graveyard for the unlikely soldiers who fought 
and won this war for America.

And what of America's trusted ally? Pakistan too has suffered 
enormously. The US government has not been shy of supporting 
military dictators who have blocked the idea of democracy from 
taking root in the country. Before the CIA arrived, there was a 
small rural market for opium in Pakistan. Between 1979 and 1985, 
the number of heroin addicts grew from zero to one-and-a-half 
million.

Now the US government is asking (asking?) Pakistan to garotte the 
pet it has hand-reared in its backyard for so many years. President 
Musharraf, having pledged his support to the US, could well find he 
has something resembling civil war on his hands. India, thanks in 
part to its geography, and in part to the vision of its former 
leaders, has so far been fortunate enough to be left out of this 
Great Game. Had it been drawn in, it's more than likely that our 
democracy, such as it is, would not have survived.

Today, as some of us watch in horror, the Indian government is 
furiously gyrating its hips, begging the US to set up its base in 
India rather than Pakistan. Having had this ringside view of 
Pakistan's sordid fate, it isn't just odd, it's unthinkable, that 
India should want to do this. Any Third World country with a 
fragile economy and a complex social base should know by now that 
to invite a superpower such as America in (whether it says it's 
staying or just passing through) would be like inviting a brick to 
drop through your windscreen.

Operation Enduring Freedom is ostensibly being fought to uphold the 
American Way of Life. It'll probably end up undermining it 
completely. It will spawn more anger and more terror across the 
world. For ordinary people in America, it will mean lives lived in 
a climate of sickening uncertainty: will my child be safe in 
school? Will there be nerve gas in the subway? A bomb in the cinema 
hall? Will my love come home tonight? There have been warnings 
about the possibility of biological warfare - smallpox, bubonic 
plague, anthrax - the deadly payload of innocuous crop-duster 
aircraft.

Being picked off a few at a time may end up being worse than being 
annihilated all at once by a nuclear bomb. The US government, and 
no doubt governments all over the world, will use the climate of 
war as an excuse to curtail civil liberties, deny free speech, lay 
off workers, harass ethnic and religious minorities, cut back on 
public spending and divert huge amounts of money to the defence 
industry. To what purpose? President Bush can no more "rid the 
world of evil-doers" than he can stock it with saints.

It's absurd for the US government to even toy with the notion that 
it can stamp out terrorism with more violence and oppression. 
Terrorism is the symptom, not the disease. Terrorism has no 
country. It's transnational, as global an enterprise as Coke or 
Pepsi or Nike. At the first sign of trouble, terrorists can pull up 
stakes and move their "factories" from country to country in search 
of a better deal. Just like the multinationals.

Terrorism as a phenomenon may never go away. But if it is to be 
contained, the first step is for America to at least acknowledge 
that it shares the planet with other nations, with other human 
beings who, even if they are not on TV, have loves and griefs and 
stories and songs and sorrows and, for heaven's sake, rights. 
Instead, when Donald Rumsfeld, the US defence secretary, was asked 
what he would call a victory in America's new war, he said that if 
he could convince the world that Americans must be allowed to 
continue with their way of life, he would consider it a victory.

The September 11 attacks were a monstrous calling card from a world 
gone horribly wrong. The message may have been written by bin Laden 
(who knows?) and delivered by his couriers, but it could well have 
been signed by the ghosts of the victims of America's old wars. The 
millions killed in Korea, Vietnam and Cambodia, the 17,500 killed 
when Israel - backed by the US - invaded Lebanon in 1982, the 
200,000 Iraqis killed in Operation Desert Storm, the thousands of 
Palestinians who have died fighting Israel's occupation of the West 
Bank. And the millions who died, in Yugoslavia, Somalia, Haiti, 
Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, Panama, at 
the hands of all the terrorists, dictators and genocidists whom the 
American government supported, trained, bankrolled and supplied 
with arms. And this is far from being a comprehensive list.

Someone recently said that if Osama bin Laden didn't exist, America 
would have had to invent him. But, in a way, America did invent 
him. He was among the jihadis who moved to Afghanistan in 1979 when 
the CIA commenced its operations there. Bin Laden has the 
distinction of being created by the CIA and wanted by the FBI. From 
all accounts, it will be impossible to produce evidence (of the 
sort that would stand scrutiny in a court of law) to link Bin Laden 
to the September 11 attacks. So far, it appears that the most 
incriminating piece of evidence against him is the fact that he has 
not condemned them.From what is known about the location of bin 
Laden and the living conditions in which he operates, it's entirely 
possible that he did not personally plan and carry out the attacks 
- that he is the inspirational figure.

Its marauding multinationals who are taking over the air we 
breathe, the ground we stand on, the water we drink, the thoughts 
we think. Now that the family secret has been spilled, the twins 
are blurring into one another and gradually becoming 
interchangeable. Their guns, bombs, money and drugs have been going 
around in the loop for a while. (The Stinger missiles that will 
greet US helicopters were supplied by the CIA. The heroin used by 
America's drug addicts comes from Afghanistan. The Bush 
administration recently gave Afghanistan a $43m subsidy for a "war 
on drugs".)

Now Bush and Bin Laden have even begun to borrow each other's 
rhetoric. Each refers to the other as "the head of the snake". Both 
invoke God and use the loose millenarian currency of good and evil 
as their terms of reference. Both are engaged in unequivocal 
political crimes. Both are dangerously armed - one with the nuclear 
arsenal of the obscenely powerful, the other with the incandescent, 
destructive power of the utterly hopeless. The fireball and the ice 
pick. The bludgeon and the axe. The important thing to keep in mind 
is that neither is an acceptable alternative to the other.

President Bush's ultimatum to the people of the world - "If you're 
not with us, you're against us" - is a piece of presumptuous 
arrogance. It's not a choice that people want to, need to, or 
should have to make. Copyright Arundhati Roy, 2001.-Dawn/Guardian

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ROTTERDAM, Nov 10: Pakistan beat England 6-3 in the final game of 
the round robin series of the Champions Trophy to earn a bronze 
medal play-off against the Netherlands, largely thanks to a Kashif 
Jawwad hat trick.

Pakistan also scored three goals in the last ten minutes to earn 
their second victory of the event. It also gave them third place 
and a chance to beat fourth-placed Netherlands in the bronze medal 
match.

Sohail Abbas put Pakistan ahead from their first corner in the 7th 
minute with a low flick but England, who had to win to make the 
bronze medal match in place of Pakistan, recovered to go ahead with 
goals by Mark Pearn and Jon Wyatt (penalty corner).

Despite England having the better of the first half, Pakistan 
levelled to 2-2 in the last minute of the half when Abbas threw a 
long high ball which England failed to control allowing Jawwad to 
nip in and score.

Abbas rubbed it in by converting Pakistan's second corner two 
minutes into the second half, his seven goals making him the 
tournament's second highest scorer, one behind Germany's Kunz.

A smartly taken goal by England captain Danny Hall made it 3-3 
after 53 minutes and England pressed hard for a fourth goal but 
failed to convert from a string of corners.

With England pressing, Pakistan were at last able to counter-attack 
and they added open play goals with good finishing by Jawwad, 
Muhammad Nadeem and, in the 69th minute, Jawwad again. -AFP

Monitoring Desk

HONG KONG, Nov 10: Pakistan made it three wins out of three and 
Aussies slumped to their third loss in succession in the Pool 'B' 
of Hong Kong Cricket Sixes 2001 at Kowloon Cricket Club.

Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat first and did well to 
break the record in the Hong Kong sixes tournament. Pakistan scored 
115 for two off their alloted 5 overs. Craig McDermott cleaned up 
Wasim Akram after the Pakistani all-rounder had hit a six over 
covers. Shahid Afridi (10) was caught behind by Kim Hughes off the 
bowling of Tom Moody. Imran Nazir retired not out 32 struck four 
sixes and a boundary, facing just 10 balls.

Shoaib Malik struck three sixes and three fours in scoring 31 runs 
off seven balls before retiring not out. Razzaq made an unbeaten 21 
off seven balls with the help of a six and three fours to take 
Pakistan to the record total of 115 off five overs.

Australia were never in the run hunt, Moody and Brendon Julian 
opening the batting again and playing orthodox cricket, while what 
it takes is slogging.

When Wasim Akram came in to bowl, Moody played a delightful shot to 
third-man for four. But Akram didn't fail to deliver, knocking out 
the middle stump to dismiss Julian 22 off 9 balls. After four overs 
Australia were 56/1 and they required an impossible 60 runs off the 
last over.

Abdur Razzaq bowled the last over and Moody helped himself to a six 
over long on before retiring not out after making 31 off 16 balls. 
Greg Matthews and Hughes didn't do much either and played out the 
over. Australia finished with 69/1 after five overs and lost the 
match by 56 runs.

Earlier, Pakistan announced their superiority by beating UAE in the 
first game by 29 runs with Wasim Akram smashing four consecutive 
sixes off Miraj Khaliq before retiring with unbeaten 33 off seven 
ball in his team's score of 108 for two.

UAE got off to a good start, Saeed-al-Saffar striking consecutive 
fours off Afridi's first over. Kaif Gaury was determined to put up 
a fight, smashing Rana Naveed-ul-Hasan for five boundaries in the 
second over

UAE finished on 79/2.

In their first match, Pakistan beat England by two wickets with one 
over to spare.

Batting first, England made 48/1 off five overs. Skipper Rashid 
Latif hit two boundaries and Abdur Razzaq struck two huge sixes as 
Pakistan raced past the target when Azhar Mahmood struck three 
consecutive fours.

<a name="comp">Pakistan complete hat trick of titles</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring Desk

HONG KONG, Nov 11: Pakistan went in to Honk Kong Cricket Sixes 2001 
as the hot favourites and they lived up to the top billing by 
winning the final against South Africa by 11 runs to complete their 
hat trick of titles here.

Once Pakistan got things right at the toss, they piled on the runs 
in the five overs and they finished with a total of 98/3.

Imran Nazir (30) and stand-in captain Wasim Akram (23) gave 
Pakistan an electrifying start. Imran struck three sixes and Akram 
hit two, to take their tally for the tournament to 11 sixes.

Imran eventually was caught by Crookes off Thomas and Akram was 
brilliantly run out by Andrew Hall.

Shahid Afridi threatened to take apart the bowling; he made 16 runs 
off just four balls and was bowled by Steve Elworthy. Azhar Mahmood 
hit two massive sixes, one of which cleared the ground to remained 
unbeaten on 13.

South Africa, in reply, got off to a fantastic start scoring 26 off 
the first over bowled by Azhar; Elworthy smacking a six into the 
swimming pool. Afridi was also punished as his over cost 22 runs.

At that stage, South Africa were in the hunt. But once Wasim Akram 
came in to bowl and things changed with yet another spectacular 
over (1-0-10-0). Akram's analysis for the tournament were 5-0-27-3.

Loots Bosman had to retire not out (31), hitting three sixes and 
three boundaries. Elworthy struck some lusty shots, but his knock 
of 24 came to an end when he caught by Akram in the deep off Shoaib 
Malik.

South Africa, who defeated England in their semifinal, could not 
keep up the pace and finished on 87/1 in five overs.

Appropriately, Wasim Akram was named the Man of the Tournament for 
his all-round brilliance. Earlier, Akram was at his vintage best as 
Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by 34 runs in the semifinal.

Imran Nazir hit four huge sixes in making 27 off nine balls. Akram 
had to retire not out after making 36 off just 10 balls, smashing 
four sixes and two boundaries while Afridi's 20 came off seven 
balls as Pakistan reached 107/1.

Almost all Sri Lankan bowlers suffered in the avalanche of runs, 
Dulip Liyanage was the most expensive (1-0-35-0).

Sri Lanka were never in the run chase against a competent bowling 
attack. Akram bowled yet another brilliant over (1-0-4-0), which 
effectively choked the Sri Lankans, who managed 73/1.

<a name="toge">Pakistan to get compensation </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ROTTERDAM, Nov 11: The International Hockey Federation (FIH) will 
take a decision on giving financial compensation to Pakistan Hockey 
Federation (PHF) because of the shifting of the Champions Trophy 
from Lahore to Rotterdam.

The Games ruling body will decide at its Executive Board meeting in 
Brussels the amount to be paid to the PHF to overcome the losses 
suffered from the shifting of the Trophy.

"We are fully aware of all the circumstances and the losses PHF has 
suffered. The FIH will give a due consideration to this issue at 
the Executive Board meeting," FIH president, Els van Breda said 
here.

Security concerns after the US attacks on Afghanistan had forced 
the FIH to shift the venue from Pakistanis city of Lahore. The 
Netherlands was awarded the tournament after bidding.

FIH chief said we will be taking good care of Pakistan's request 
for compensation "The Dutch Hockey Federation officials have 
requested the FIH to use part of the hosting fee they are due to 
pay to the FIH as compensation to the Pakistan," he said. Moreover, 
she said, the English Hockey Federation had offered the FIH it was 
willing to pay the PHF the amount they had saved on account of 
travel expenses by travelling to Rotterdam instead of Lahore.

The PHF official said there were a number of proposals for 
compensation including organizing a four-nation series in Pakistan 
in January or April next year, provided the recent situation in the 
region improved in the near future.

England, Germany and Holland have expressed willingness to play in 
Pakistan and it was very encouraging response on part of these 
hockey nations, the official said.-APP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Nov 11: Pakistan cricket great Imran Khan came out in 
support of paceman Shoiab Akhtar, who is considering taking legal 
action after being reported for "chucking" to the International 
Cricket Council (ICC).

"I think Akhtar has a very good case to take to court," Khan told 
AFP. "He has already been cleared scientifically, so why is his 
action being brought into question one more time?" the former 
Pakistani skipper added.

Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Lieutenant General Tauqir Zia also 
said his board would back Akhtar, 26, if he decides to take legal 
action. Zia said the board would send a strongly-worded protest to 
the ICC, which has appointed former West Indian pacer Michael 
Holding to work on Akhtar's action.

The ICC confirmed that umpires had reported Akhtar's action as 
"suspect" following the Champions Trophy tournament in Sharjah 
which Pakistan won last week.

"Akhtar has an unusual bowling arm and it has been shown on 
television all over the world. The hyper-extension of his arm gives 
an illusion of chucking," Khan argued.-AFP

<a name="requ">Pakistan requests ICC to form special body</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Nov 12: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has asked the 
International Cricket Council (ICC) to set up a special committee 
to deal with pace bowler Shoaib Akhtar's suspect bowling action.

PCB Director Brig Munawwar Rana said a letter had been sent to the 
ICC requesting that any inquiry into Shoaib's bowling action be 
dealt as a special case.

"Our point of view is very clear. We feel there is no problem at 
all with Shoaib's bowling action and he is not violating any 
cricket law," Munawwar told Reuters. "His problem lies in his 
peculiar physiology with respect to hyper-mobility.

"What we have asked the ICC to do is appoint a sub-committee of its 
cricket committee which should look into this case and than make 
its recommendations back to the Executive Board," he added.

Shoaib, 26, was reported for a suspect bowling action for the third 
time since December 1999 after the recent triangular tournament in 
Sharjah.

But the PCB has made it clear that before any further steps are 
taken the ICC should give a clear decision on a medical report 
prepared on Shoaib earlier this year by the University of Western 
Australia's department of bio-mechanics.

Munawwar said Shoaib had been put through stage one of the ICC 
bowling action review process and experts had declared that he did 
not throw the ball but had a physiological problem of hyper-
mobility in the joints of his bowling arm.

"The main thing is there is no capacity in the present ICC rules to 
deal with a special case like that of Shoaib, which is why we are 
asking for the sub-committee to be constituted," Rana said.

The PCB has said it would support Shoaib if he resorted to the 
courts to try and have his controversial bowling action declared 
legal. But Munawwar added that although the PCB had nothing against 
the ICC appointing West Indian Michael Holding as bowling advisor 
to Shoaib, it was not appropriate at this time.

"We have said in our letter that Holding is among the greats and 
greatly respected in the cricket world and we share that feeling 
for him," he said. "But we don't think at this stage his coming to 
Pakistan will serve any purpose."

Holding is expected to visit Pakistan later this month.-Reuters

KARACHI, Nov 13: The controversial career of Shoaib Akhtar took yet 
another twist when his alleged misconduct during the Sharjah Cup 
final against Sri Lanka was referred to the Pakistan Cricket Board 
(PCB) disciplinary committee.

Television footages showed Shoaib Akhtar showing gestures to Sri 
Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardena after having him caught behind. 
Had former captain Wasim Akram not intervened, the situation might 
have gone out of hand.

"In view of the reports appearing in the media regarding alleged 
misconduct of Shoaib Akhtar at Sharjah in matches against Sri 
Lanka, chairman PCB has referred the matter to the PCB disciplinary 
committee," the PCB said in a written statement.

Shoaib has been summoned before the disciplinary committee Monday. 
The committee is headed by Brig Iqbal Awan with Sirajul Islam 
Bukhari, Abdul Raqib and Maazullah as members.

<a name="pcbr">PCB requests rejected</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 13: The International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected 
Pakistan's requests for dealing with paceman Shoaib Akhtar who was 
reported for a suspect bowling action during the Sharjah Cup.

The Pakistan Cricket Board, last week, had objected to ICC's 
decision of implementing Stage Two when it appointed Michael 
Holding as Shoaib's bowling advisor. The PCB maintained that the 
ICC should first decide if it believed the credibility and 
authenticity of Australian Institute of Human Resources.

The Perth-based institute, in its report, has said Shoaib's bowling 
arm was deformed at birth giving an illusion of throwing. The PCB 
had also said it was not in a position to bear the three-month 
expenses of Holding though the former West Indian quickie was more 
than welcome to the country in any other capacity.

"The ICC is not reviewing its decision to appoint Michael Holding 
to work with Shoaib.

"The cost involved with Stage Two will be at the PCB's expense," 
ICC's communication manager Mark Harrison said in a statement to 
Dawn.

Shoaib was reported for the third time since December 1999 for a 
suspect bowling action. Holding has to submit his report to the ICC 
and the PCB by Feb 7. Until that time, Shoaib was cleared to play 
but would be banned for one year if reported again.

The PCB is facing a financial crunch after it was denied the right 
to earn estimated $30million this year in lieu of cancellation of 
Indian and New Zealand tours. However, the ICC said the extent of 
Holding's work with Shoaib will be by agreement between the PCB, 
Michael and Shoaib.

"The consultancy can take place at any suitable and appropriate 
location, providing that facilities required by the advisor are 
available and to the required standard," the ICC said.

The ICC said before Holding began working with Shoaib, he would be 
fully briefed by the ICC and supplied with all relevant background 
and reference material. "These will include the report compiled in 
Western Australia during Stage One of the reporting and review 
process, together with video footage of Shoaib bowling in Sharjah 
and elsewhere as required."

The ICC consulted with many former Test players and captains in 
developing the new process and believe it represents a fair but 
effective solution to the problem.

This is a sensitive area and we have put forward a system that 
offers help and assistance to bowlers suspected of having problems 
with their actions.

"These three stages give ample opportunity for a player to overcome 
these and demonstrate conclusively that his action is entirely 
legal, while remaining within the game."

<a name="iccr">ICC refuses to treat Shoaib as special case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hassan

KARACHI, Nov 14: The International Cricket Council (ICC) spurned 
Pakistan Cricket Board's request to treat Shoaib Akhtar as special 
case. "Having discussed your request with the ICC President 
(Malcolm Gray), I am unable to agree to treat this as a special 
case outside the carefully established process to deal with matters 
of this kind," ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said in a hard-
hitting statement to Dawn.

His reaction came after the PCB publicized its four-page request, 
signed by director Brig Munawwar Rana, on its official website.

The game's controlling body further said although it had appointed 
Michael Holding to work as Shoaib's advisor, it could not and would 
not force Shoaib or the PCB to utilize his services. "If the PCB 
formally declines to comply with the Stage Two process, the ICC 
would notify all umpires and referees of that decision. "This would 
effectively conclude Stage Two and Shoaib could continue to play, 
having forfeited the opportunity to work with one of the world's 
greatest and most knowledgeable fast bowlers."  However, the risk 
in declining the option of a bowling advisor would mean an instant 
one-year suspension if Shoaib was reported again.

<a name="shoa">Shoaib apologizes over gestures </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 14: Shoaib Akhtar apologized to his fans over his 
conduct in the Sharjah Cup final against Sri Lanka which is to be 
investigated by the PCB disciplinary committee.

"I am extremely sorry and apologetic over whatever happened. It all 
happened in the heat of the moment but I can now only regret".

Shoaib is set to appear before the Pakistan Cricket Board 
disciplinary committee Monday. However, initial indications were 
that the bowler would be left off with a reprimand.

A committee member, on the condition of anonymity, argued that if 
the match referee (Denis Lindsay) didn't penalize Shoaib, they 
didn't have a solid case to impose fine.

"Shoaib's gestures must have been within the laws of the game 
otherwise he would have been pulled up by the match referee."

Lindsay didn't take notice of the on-the-field incident but left 
Shoaib's career in jeopardy when he raised unsubstantiated 
"concerns" against his bowling action. 

Shoaib, who was also fined Rs50,000 and suspended from a one-day 
international in March last year, admitted he failed to control his 
emotions." Looking back at things, I realize that I should have 
acted more professionally and maturely. "I couldn't control my 
emotions and got carried away by the atmosphere which was very 
charged," Shoaib said.

Shoaib passed on remarks and showed gestures to Sri Lankan batsman 
Mahela Jayawardena after getting him caught behind. A ball earlier, 
the Sri Lankan had struck Shoaib for a boundary. The batsman had 
also welcomed Shoaib with a first-ball six over long-leg.

"From Dennis Lillee to Brett Lee, all fast bowlers do different 
things to upset the batsman. It's very natural. "When one takes a 
prized scalp, he celebrates and can deliver some unkind words," 
Shoaib said.
