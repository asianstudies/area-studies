<a name="airb">Airbases given to US will be used for rescue work: Moin</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Oct 12: The government has allowed the US-led coalition 
to use two Pakistani airports "for undertaking search and rescue 
operation," Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider told Dawn.

"Yes, Jacobabad and Pasni airports have been allowed to be used by 
the US-led coalition...but only for search and rescue operation to 
help pull out their injured troops from Afghanistan," he said. "Our 
airports and other facilities have been provided for non-combat 
role," the minister said, adding Pakistan was not offering 
permanent military bases to the coalition as were seen in the 
Middle East after the Iraq-Kuwait war.

Pakistan, he said, was allowing Americans to use local airports in 
line with its decision to provide airspace, logistics and 
intelligence to get hold of terrorists in Afghanistan. "But," he 
clarified, "this is a limited permission and is not aimed at 
allowing them to launch attacks in Afghanistan from our air or land 
bases,"

The US-led coalition, he said, would vacate Pakistan's airports as 
soon the objectives of hunting down terrorists were achieved.

<a name="amer">Americans using Jacobabad airport</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shamim Shamsi

SUKKUR, Oct 12: The Jacobabad airport, is humming with activity 
with US military planes frequently landing and taking off. On 
Thursday, locals saw a number of military planes taking off from 
the airport, and they believed the aircraft had flown in the 
direction of Quetta.

They said some of those planes were C-130, the jumbo aircraft 
normally used for carrying arms and supplies during war. People 
living in the vicinity of the airport said they had seen American 
pilots alighting from those planes. Residents of Jacobabad said 
there was panic in the town as power supply to the surrounding 
areas of the airport was switched off every night, creating a 
blackout-like situation.

Civil and military authorities have got vacated many houses in the 
vicinity of the airport, particularly Soomar Goth. These houses are 
now being given to the army personnel. Strict security measures 
have been taken to guard government installations. Besides, as part 
of its strike, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam had announced that it would 
bring out a procession in Sukkur but the military authorities did 
not grant them permission.

<a name="juig">JUI gives call for 'gherao' of Jacobabad airport</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sabihuddin Ghausi and Saleem Shahid

QUETTA, Oct 12: Maulana Abdul Ghafur Haidri, Secretary-General of 
Jamiat Ulema Islam (JUI) and a former Balochistan minister, gave a 
call to 'gherao' Jacobabad Airport on Sunday (Oct 14) and observe a 
countrywide strike on Monday.

The JUI leader's threats came in the wake of the reports that the 
government has handed over airports at Jacobabad, Pasni and some 
other places to the US-led coalition forces to carry out attacks on 
Afghanistan.

A striking feature of the JUI protest meeting was the presence of a 
large number of foreign journalists and media teams, including 
women, who moved around with chaddars covering their heads, to 
record the proceedings of the meetings. Policemen and their local 
friends escorted foreign journalists. Appeals were made from the 
stage to take care of "foreign friends" who are in the meeting for 
coverage.

<a name="fier">Fierce bombing unleashes devastation on Kabul</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KABUL/WASHINGTON, Oct 11: US led forces using cluster bombs 
unleashed the fiercest round yet of their onslaught on Afghanistan 
on Thursday in what Kabul residents called a terrible inferno of 
destruction.

Taliban said more than 140 civilians had been killed in the last 24 
hours of the raids since Sunday when the attacks were launched. 
They said 50 bodies had been pulled from the rubble of one village.

The campaign against the Taliban has stoked anti-Western anger 
among Muslims from Jakarta to Cape Town and British Prime Minister 
Tony Blair said Western countries were in danger of losing the 
propaganda battle for Arab and Muslim support.

Britain said the war, in which it is helping the United States, 
would stretch well into next year. "We must expect at least to go 
through the winter into next summer at the very least," Sir Michael 
Boyce, chief of the British defence staff, told a news conference. 
He said the campaign had hit 40 targets so far.

US defence officials said heavy B-52 and B-1 bombers targeted 
Taliban troops overnight on Wednesday and into Thursday, using 
among other weapons cluster bombs that open as they fall to release 
dozens of high-explosive bomblets. "We dropped a lot of bombs," one 
of the officials said. "We have said that this will be relentless, 
and it will."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Oct 11: Pakistan confirmed that the US military 
personnel had arrived in the country but said it would not be a 
base for US-led strikes on Afghanistan.

When asked if the US military personnel were already on the ground, 
Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi said: "I don't think they're combat troops." 
Gen Qureshi, however, declined to provide details of the support 
Pakistan was giving to the United States. "However, I can say that 
there are no offensive operations that have been launched or are 
being launched against Afghanistan from Pakistan," he said.

"Pakistan has committed to support and cooperating with the world 
community and the United States in promising an exchange of 
information and intelligence, airspace, whenever and if ever 
required, and logistical support whenever it is required," said 
Qureshi. But he would not confirm details of support to the United 
States: "That could compromise the tactical plan so we are not 
talking about it." Gen Qureshi declined to say who the US military 
personnel were.-Reuters/dpa

<a name="impo">Imposed setup not acceptable: CE for multi-ethnic Afghan system </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 10: President Gen Pervez Musharraf has said that he 
had made it clear to the US and British governments that "no 
imposed dispensation" in Afghanistan will be acceptable to 
Pakistan.

"Such a dispensation will be unworkable and could not last," he 
observed, while briefing the federal cabinet here on Wednesday on 
the current situation relating to actions against the Taliban 
regime in Afghanistan. Official sources quoted the president as 
telling the cabinet that a broad-based government will be 
acceptable to Pakistan which represented all ethnic groups.

The federal cabinet decided to take serious action against those 
creating a law and order situation. It resolved to maintain order 
at all cost by firmly dealing with the law breakers. 

The government would not tolerate the burning of government 
buildings and other facilities, he warned. National security will 
be maintained at all cost and that violators of the law will not go 
unpunished, the president told the meeting, adding that he had 
taken a very serious view of the ongoing protests in which 
government properties were set on fire at some places.

The president also told his cabinet colleagues that Pakistan stood 
committed to providing airspace and logistics to the US-led 
military coalition and sharing of information with it. However, the 
sources said, he informed the meeting that no airbase was provided 
to the US-led coalition to launch any attack on Afghanistan. He 
termed the action "very unfortunate". "No military action is taking 
place with our support as no aircraft has flown from Pakistan's 
airbase to attack Afghanistan," the president was quoted as having 
told the meeting.

He said the action was not against the people of Afghanistan or 
Islam "as many people wrongly believed." He said Pakistan never 
wanted the destruction of Afghanistan. But he regretted that the 
Taliban did not accept any rational or friendly advice that landed 
them in trouble. "We do not want any harm to Afghan people," he 
said, adding that it was a matter of record that Pakistan tried 
hard to the last but Taliban did not respond in a positive manner 
to avert the attack.

The president briefed the meeting about the current situation, 
especially his telephonic talks with President Bush and his meeting 
with British Prime Minister Tony Blair. The president told the 
cabinet that President Bush had informed him on Sunday evening (Oct 
7) about US air strikes against Afghanistan, the sources said.

<a name="targ">Target list expanded, says Pentagon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON, Oct 9: US forces struck at Afghanistan bombarding the 
home of Mulla Mohammad Omar during the first daytime strikes of the 
three-day-old air-strikes.

"Strikes continue," a Pentagon official said, as nightfall in 
Afghanistan was marked with renewed anti-aircraft fire in Kandahar 
and Jalalabad, and a powercut in Kabul.

On Monday, a US missile strike killed four Afghans working for a 
United Nations mine disposal team in Kabul and on Tuesday relief 
agencies said safety fears had forced them to suspend aid convoys 
into Afghanistan. But despite the apparent targeting error, 
Pentagon officials said the raids appeared to be doing their job, 
striking the residential compound of the Taliban's shadowy supreme 
leader, Mulla Mohammad Omar. 

The Pentagon said that US forces' target list had been expanded to 
include Taliban armour as well as air defences, as the campaign 
aimed to expose the militia to attack from the Northern Alliance 
and to further airstrikes.-AFP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ROME, Oct 9: Afghanistan's former royal family has warned Pakistan 
not to try to play a kingmaker's role if the Taliban government 
collapses under internal and external pressure.

General Abdul Wali, a senior aide and son-in-law of the former 
monarch, Mohammed Zahir Shah, said that the ex-king has, however, 
nominated a delegation to travel to Pakistan in a week's time. 
"Nobody has the right to interfere in our Afghan policy," he 
warned.

"The delegation will exchange views on the two countries' bilateral 
relations," he said. He also warned Pakistan not to interfere in 
Afghanistan's internal affairs by favoring one Afghan ethnic group 
against another.

"Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmen, Hazaras, Nooristanis and others 
constitute the Afghan people," he said. "It is the job of the 
Afghan people and only the Afghan people to determine the future 
government of Afghanistan. We have no consultations with others," 
he said, after attending a session of Zahir's associates and other 
exiled Afghan dignitaries here.-AFP

following the start of attacks on Afghanistan it would review the 
situation every hour.

"Everything is normal and we have issued clearance to all in- and 
out-bound flights to land and take off from any airport in 
Pakistan," said Air Vice-Marshall Arshad Sethi, deputy director-
general, CAA. " We are reviewing the situation on an hourly basis 
and as and when the situation develops we will issue necessary

of the Northern Alliance's former commander Ahmad Shah Masood, who 
was assassinated last month.-Reuters

<a name="only">Only terrorist camps targeted: No use of Pakistan bases</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 8: President Gen Pervez Musharraf said that the US-
led military strikes against the Taliban would be short and 
targeted to eliminate the terrorist camps of the Al-Qaeda 
organization.

"I am reasonably sure that military action is carefully targeted 
which is expected to be short and will lead to a political 
dispensation in Afghanistan," he stated. Speaking at a news 
conference, Gen Musharraf supported the action against the Taliban, 
which, according to him, was inevitable due to "unwise policies of 
the Kabul regime".

He made it clear that no airbase of Pakistan was used by the US-led 
coalition to launch strikes. "We did provide them airspace, 
logistics and shared information with them as was earlier promised 
by Pakistan." All strikes, he said, were launched from the US 
aircraft carrier, Gulf states and some of the Central Asian States.

About the post-action political dispensation, Gen Musharraf said 
that three things would have to be kept in mind once the objectives 
of combating terrorism were achieved in Afghanistan. These things, 
he said, were post-action rehabilitation of Afghanistan, revival of 
political dispensation and restoration of law and order by taking 
into account the demographic and ethnic considerations of 
Afghanistan.

The president said that any solution which did not ensure setting 
up of a broad-based government in Afghanistan would not be 
acceptable to Pakistan. 

He said that he was assured by the US and British governments that 
they would provide all necessary support for restoring 
infrastructure and construction work in Afghanistan.

The humanitarian efforts, he said, needed to be reinforced through 
the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees 
after the action against Taliban was complete. "While air strikes 
are going on, relief activities are also picking up with UN 
agencies dropping considerable food aid there," he added. 

Gen Musharraf claimed that a vast majority of people in Pakistan 
supported his stand on the current situation. "There are some 
religious extremists who are opposing but that does not make any 
difference."

"There is another cause of concern for us that foreign companies 
and foreign investors are leaving Pakistan," he said, adding that 
Pakistan had lost many export orders and was facing new economic 
problems. He said the air of uncertainty should end so that 
Pakistan could look after its economic interests properly.

<a name="thea">The attack has begun: Taliban vow to fight till their last breath</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza in Washington and Faraz Hashmi in Islamabad

WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD, Oct 7: The United States, in concert with 
Britain, struck at what were described as Al Qaeda training camps 
and Taliban command and control facilities at several places in 
Afghanistan, signalling the start of a military campaign against 
the Kabul regime and Osama bin Laden expected ever since the Sept 
11 attacks in New York and Washington.

President George Bush in a televized address shortly after news of 
the strikes was announced described the action as marking the 
beginning of a "sustained and relentless" operation to drive out 
terrorists and destroy Taliban military facilities.

The Pentagon said air defences, terrorist training camps and other 
strategic military targets linked to the Taliban were hit. Pentagon 
officials confirmed that the strikes began with cruise missile 
strikes launched from US and British ships in the Arabian Sea, 
including at least one British submarine. US fighter planes from 
aircraft carriers were also involved.

Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and chairman of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff, General Richard Myers, told a briefing on Sunday 
afternoon that a variety of locations and weapons systems, 
including at least 50 Tomahawk missiles, had been used.

At least three cities were affected in the strikes which targeted 
places in the neighbourhood of Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. A 
Taliban central command base outside Kandahar was said to have been 
destroyed in the first wave of attacks.

Defence Secretary Rumsfeld said strikes were part of a continuing 
operation that would sometimes be visible and sometimes not and 
which would encompass political, diplomatic and economic tools 
besides military action, which is being increasingly seen as a 
punitive first assault designed to pulverize the Taliban and force 
them to end backing Al Qaeda. Mr Rumsfeld also said humanitarian 
assistance had begun to be air-dropped in tandem with the military 
strikes.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 11: Government said that it wanted peaceful 
settlement of all its disputes with India, including the issue of 
Kashmir, but it was ready to repulse any aggression. "Pakistan 
desires settling of all issues through peaceful means. However, 
Pakistan armed forces are ready to face and repulse any 
aggression," a Foreign Office spokesman said.

The spokesman was asked to comment on the reports emanating from 
New Delhi that India might consider military action against alleged 
terrorist camps in Azad Kashmir. He said Pakistan had the 
capability to defend itself.

On the possibility of the United States playing a mediatory role 
between India and Pakistan, he said Pakistan would like to resolve 
all outstanding disputes with India, including the issue of Jammu 
and Kashmir, through peaceful means. He said these peaceful means 
could be talks under United Nations charter or through third party 
mediation or any other country or through bilateral talks.

The spokesman refused to comment on the presence of the United 
States combat troops at Jacobabad and other places in the country. 
"Please refrain from asking any question regarding military 
affairs," he said, avoiding repeated questions from the 
representatives of national and international media organizations, 
seeking confirmation of landing of the US troops in Pakistan.

Vajpayee gave no details on plans to expand strikes in held

NEW DELHI, Oct 9: Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee could 
visit Pakistan as soon as the shooting war with Afghanistan abates, 
amid indications that a global consensus was shaping to nudge both 
countries towards getting their uneasy relationship to look up, 
diplomatic sources said.

They said a telephone conversation by President Musharraf to Prime 
Minister Vajpayee had considerably helped ease the mistrust between 
the two leaders. In an unusual gesture the two leaders agreed that 
India would send relief material to Pakistan by the land corridor 
as an expression of its solidarity with the anti-terrorist 
coalition of which Islamabad is a key member.

supported by both India and Pakistan and asked both countries to 
create conflict management mechanism to ease tensions on the 
borders.

She also called on the international community to stick around and 
help in rebuilding the Afghan society after the global coalition 
has achieved its objectives in Afghanistan.

In an interview with Dawn, Benazir said that "it is an opportunity 
for Pakistan to try and clean up our own society so we can put an 
end to the sectarian violence and it is also an opportunity for all 
of us to ensure that they are no private militias." It is also time 
for us to consider military and security reforms for a new age she 
expounded.

Benazir hoped that a broad-based consensus government acceptable to 
the Afghan people should be allowed to be established in Kabul. 
Although she was reluctant to talk about the prospects of election 
in Pakistan stipulated for Oct 2002, since the situation has 
changed dramatically, Ms Bhutto conceded "well there is a school of 
thought that believes that since the situation has changed so 
dramatically the military rule should continue but the another 
school which believes that democracy is the only way that the 
country can move forward and in fact it is through transfer of 
power to the people can Pakistan gain strength and recognition on 
the international stage.

Asked whether she would return to Pakistan to participate in the 
elections despite threats from the military government that she 
could be arrested, Ms Bhutto said "Yes I intend to contest the 
elections personally ." 

As regards the reports of a deal struck between PPP and Gen Pervez 
Musharraf recently, Ms Bhutto said "there was no deal struck." She 
did acknowledge that some suggestions were made regards to her 
participation in the elections, but declared "My party has rejected 
them."

Dawn Report

LAHORE, Oct 7: The JUI and Jamaat-i-Islami heads condemned the 
American airstrikes on Afghanistan, fearing that these might have 
killed innocent people. JUI(F) President Maulana Fazlur Rehman said 
his party would fight shoulder to shoulder with Taliban and defeat 
America, asking his partymen to start staging demonstrations 
against America all over the country. Jamat-i-Islami Amir Qazi 
Hussain Ahmad termed the airstrikes a cowardly act reflecting the 
moral bankruptcy of the American administration.

The JI chief asked the government of Pakistan to immediately 
distance itself from the late-night operation. He said that a 
meeting of the Organization of Islamic Conference should be 
convened to discuss the US move. Qazi Hussain Ahmad said that it 
was unfair on the part of the US administration to let loose a 
reign of terror on the innocent people of Afghanistan in the 
aftermath of Sept 11 incidents.

<a name="oicc">OIC calls for moot to define terrorism</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, Oct 6: Condemning all forms of "terrorism" the 
Organization of Islamic Conference stressed that the legitimate 
freedom movements against foreign occupation should not be confused 
with "terrorism" and called for convening of an international 
conference to define the term terrorism urgently.

Addressing the UN general assembly's debate on terrorism as it came 
to a conclusion, Mokhtar Lamani, speaking for the OIC said that 
extremism, violence and terrorism were international phenomena not 
restricted to specific people, race or religion. "Islam is innocent 
of all forms of terrorism and condemns strongly the perpetrators of 
these horrendous crimes under the name of Islam or any other 
justification," he stressed. 

The members stressed that the UN should play a key role in 
intensifying international efforts to combat the menace. 

Annan expressed hope that the UN membership would work hard to 
finalize a draft comprehensive treaty banning terrorism, "and add 
it to the 12 conventions and protocols which have already been 
passed" by the General Assembly. "I would also hope that when the 
heads of states and the ministers come here for the (Assembly's) 
general debate in November, most of them will be ready to sign and 
work for ratification of these conventions, and above all, work 
hard to implement them," he stressed.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 7: The corps commanders met to discuss latest 
security situation in the region amid strong reports that two 
senior most generals, including ISI chief, had resigned for being 
superseded.

Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi, director-general, ISPR, when contacted by 
Dawn late night about the resignations, did not confirm or deny. He 
said: "I have no knowledge about the resignations". He, however, 
confirmed that Gen Muzaffar Hussain Usmani, deputy chief of army 
staff and Lt. Gen Mehmood, director general Inter Services 
Intelligence (ISI) were senior to Lt. Gen. Aziz Khan, corps 
commander Lahore and Lt Gen Mohammad Yousaf, chief of general 
staff.

An ISPR press release said that Lt Gen Mohammad Aziz Khan,

staff Pakistan have been promoted to the rank of general with 
immediate effect. "Gen Mohammad Aziz Khan has been appointed as 
Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee while Gen Mohammad Yousaf 
has been appointed Vice Chief of Army Staff.

Meanwhile, selective reports pouring out of the corps commanders 
meeting indicated that armed forces personnel were being redeployed 
for enhanced security measures.

Defence sources said that additional units were relocated from 
their parent corps and deployed in and around the federal capital. 
Instructions were also conveyed for beefing up the security around 
important installations.

Special anti-terrorist squads were deputed in all major cities to 
avoid any untoward incident. Armed forces personnel were put on 
alert to in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta and Islamabad to 
control any politico-religious backlash.

<a name="pass">Passenger plane evades collision over Pakistan </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
FRANKFURT, Oct 9: A Lufthansa jumbo jet, en route from Bangkok, was 
forced to dodge two US fighter jets to avoid a collision in 
airspace south of Pakistan, a company spokesman said.

The incident occurred in the evening just around the time the US 
and Britain were launching their first attacks against Afghanistan, 
said a spokesman. The Lufthansa jet, carrying 308 passengers from 
Bangkok to Frankfurt, was cruising at an altitude of 10,000 metres 
in an international air corridor south of Pakistan when it was 
approached by two US military jets.

"Our plane had the bad luck to be flying in the zone at the moment 
when the US-led assault began," the spokesman said. Like all 
Lufthansa jets, the aircraft was equipped with an automatic alert 
system which tells the pilot to direct the jet higher when a flying 
object comes "unusually" close. "This is what happened," the 
spokesman said. The US fighter jets established contact with 
Lufthansa plane to double-check its identity. Once that had been 
done, "they departed and the jet could carry on its journey as 
normal", he said.-AFP

Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Oct 12: Jaish-i-Mohammad is among the additions to the 
list of organizations whose assets have been frozen for suspected 
links to terrorism. The group is included in the 39 entities and 
individuals added to the list of 27 issued earlier by the US 
government.

While not on the list of the State Department's officially 
designated terrorist organizations, Jaish is on the department's 
watch list. Also among the additions are Haji Abdul Mannan of Al 
Qadir Traders in Quetta, described as a "havala trader," Mufti 
Rashid Ahmad, who "may be in Karachi" and is believed to have links 
with the Al Rashid Trust, mentioned in the previous list, and an 
organization called Rabita Trust.

Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill signed a "blocking order" freezing 
assets in the US of the organizations on this and the previous 
list. The Bush administration is providing the list to other 
governments as well, asking them to join the international 
crackdown on terror financing.

Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 12: Pakistan rejected UNHCR's claim of red tapism in 
preventing the field teams of the refugee agency from getting 
access to border areas. Talking to Dawn, federal minister for 
Kashmir affairs and Northern Areas division, Abbas Sarfaraz, said 
Pakistani authorities are not resorting to red tapism but instead 
have been facilitating the UNHCR right from the beginning to 
prevent any obstacles in their relief work.

"The UN staff itself is feeling threatened of visiting the border 
areas for security concerns and a number of their international 
staff have left the forward areas," the minister claimed. 

The federal minister, elaborating the Pakistani stance on relief 
operations of UNHCR said that the over riding concern of Pakistan 
is to get the aid delivered. "It is immaterial for us whether the 
aid is delivered by the international staff of UNHCR or the local 
staff."

LUXEMBOURG, Oct 8: Relations with Pakistan climbed up the European 
Union's foreign policy agenda as the bloc's 15 foreign ministers 
promised to "continue and develop" political ties with Pakistan and 
said they were ready to sign a new cooperation treaty with 
Islamabad.

The European Commission has been instructed to look into plans to 
revive the agreement which was put on ice following a military 
take-over in the country in October 1999. Diplomats say the EU is 
also considering an unprecedented package of budgetary aid for 
Islamabad in addition to increased humanitarian assistance.

<a name="4bnr">$4bn routed through hundi system annually</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Arshad Sharif

ISLAMABAD, Oct 8: An estimated amount of $4 billion are routed 
through the "hundi" system in the country every year, senior 
finance ministry officials told Dawn. 

According to sources, the money trail of hundi is under 
investigation by US and its allies for the suspicion that it is one 
of the conduits of cash flows to terrorist organizations.

Interviews revealed that secrecy and security are the attractions 
of the hundi network. There are no forms to fill out. Depending on 
the money changer, the limit to a transaction is usually how much 
cash you are willing to carry in your pocket. The hundi network 
remains the preferred way overseas Pakistanis send money back home.

According to officials, the government is focusing on the hundi 
transactions and preparing for a major crackdown. Much of the focus 
for international investigations to track down hundi transactions 
will be on Dubai. The Emirate functions as the most important 
centre for the funds of money changers from across the Muslim 
world. But the trail is likely to extend far beyond the Arab world 
to banks in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia.

Banking officials said that hundi got a big international push in 
the 1970s and 1980s with an exodus of millions of Pakistanis to 
better-paying jobs abroad. The system found its largest echo in the 
Bank of Credit & Commerce International. A number of Western 
countries used BCCI through the 1980s to channel billions of 
dollars in covert aid to Afghan rebels fighting Soviet occupation. 
BCCI collapsed in 1991.

A senior government official said that local financial authorities 
have been tightly monitoring the foreign exchange markets in an 
effort to prevent money laundering. "We have asked exchange houses 
to ensure that these funds are legitimate workers' money," a 
central-bank official says.

WASHINGTON, Oct 6: The Bush administration is readying a package of

hunt for Osama bin Laden, congressional sources said.

The measures would remove hurdles to accessing the US market, 
particularly for textile and apparel products. 

Bush has already rescheduled hundreds of millions of dollars of 
debt and eased economic sanctions to reward Pakistan for its help. 
But administration and congressional officials say the aid will not 
stop there. They are readying a $600 million economic assistance 
package, of which easing US restrictions on textile products would 
be a part. - Reuters

<a name="expo">Exports up by 4.30pc in Sept: Imports decline</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 9: Pakistan's exports in September 2001 increased by 
2.46 per cent to $799.6 million when compared with $780 million in 
August, but imports in the same month fell by 17.11 per cent to 
$777 million as against $938 million in August.

Even if exports of September 2001 of $799 million were compared 
with exports of same period of 2000, it showed an increase of 4.30 
per cent. Exports in September 2000 were $766 million, says 
provisional figures released by the Federal Bureau of Statistics 
(FBS) on Tuesday.

Imports declined by 18.13 per cent in September 2001 to $777 
million as compared to $950 million in the same period of 2000. 
"Exports have increased due to shipments of old orders," an 
exporter said fearing decline in October owing to slowdown in 
bookings by foreign buyers and delay in confirming letter of 
credits (LCs) after September 11 incident.

Exporters paint a gloomy picture of foreign exchange earnings in 
October and November in case the US intensifies attacks on 
Afghanistan. "The real impact of September 11 will be felt in the 
current month and next month," they said.

The government had already warned of a possible decline in exports 
by $1.5 to $2 billion in the current fiscal in view of the current 
situations. In July-September 2001, exports also rose by 1.77 per 
cent to $2.264 billion from $2.225 billion in the same period of 
2000. However, imports registered a fall of 8.18 per cent to $2.507 
billion in the first quarter of 2001 as compared to $2.730 billion 
in the corresponding period of 2000.

<a name="caul">The Afghan cauldron</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

Blighted as this nation is, it should count its blessings (however 
few they be). At the dawning of each day we awake and yawn, the sun 
rises, and with it comes sunshine. We are fortunate, at this 
particular moment in time, not to be led by either of the two 
'cartoon figures' who dominated the nineties.

We are fortunate now to be led by a man who can differentiate 
between tactics and strategy. Pervez Musharraf is strong, for he is 
able to admit how weak is his nation, how it cannot take on the 
whole wide world.

We are fortunate that Big Chief Bush has sound advisers who have 
been able to persuade him that a multi-billion dollar missile, if 
directed towards Afghanistan, on landing is likely to merely 
demolish a tattered tent, with perhaps its peasant owner and his 
donkey tethered outside. Bush is fully aware that his government 
and its men brought in Osama bin Laden and with him his Al-Qaeda, 
both of which they now wish to demolish.

The world may not need to realize the fact, but we must realize 
that we will always have Afghanistan on our north-west frontier. 

The world is now at war with the present rulers of that country and 
is using science to fight ignorance. 

How many of Bush's advisers and the advisers of his partners in the 
alliance which wishes to instal a 'friendly' regime to replace the 
extremely unfriendly Taliban take into account that there are 
sixteen ethnic groups from which they will have to form and mould 
and then nurture the succeeding regime? 

The alliance partners will have to deal with Afghans, Tajiks, Pamir 
Tajiks, Balochs, Berberi Hazaras, Deh-i-Zainat Hazaras, Jamshedis, 
Firuz Kuhis, Taimanis, Taimuris, Nuristanis, Uzbeks, Turkumans, 
Kyrghyzis, Karakalpaks, and lastly Arabs.

To understand Afghanistan, George W Bush can talk to two scholars 
inherited by America, Vartan Gregorian and Farang Mehr.

Farang Mehr, my friend, was born in Tehran of a Zarathushti family 
from Yazd. He started out in oil and insurance, was appointed 
deputy prime minister of Iran in Amir Abbas Hoveida's time. When he 
tired of politics he was appointed Chancellor of the University of 
Shiraz.

When Imam Khomeni and his revolution arrived he fled Iran, went to 
the States, and is now Professor Emeritus of International 
Relations at the Boston University. Farang was and is very aware of 
the Persian saying, 'It is easy to become a mullah, but hard to be 
a human being.' 

His biography 'Triumph Over Discrimination' has been written by 
Lylah Alphonse and was published in the year 2000. 

He is a master on the twists and turns of the Iranian and Afghan 
thought process. 

He could prove very valuable on the 'psychological warfare' side of 
the present operation.

Gregorian, who I have had the pleasure of knowing, is an Armenian 
born in Tabriz, Iran, who earned his degree in history and 
humanities from Stanford, and has taught European and Middle 
Eastern history at many colleges and universities in the States. I 
first met him when he was president of the New York Public Library, 
a position he held from 1981 to 1989. 

He moved on to become president of Brown University, and later 
president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, which position 
he still holds. He is the author of 'The Emergence of Modern 
Afghanistan , Politics of Reform and Modernization from 1880-1946' 
(published 1969).

Just scanning through the headings of the fourteen chapters of 
Vartan's book gives one a good idea of Afghan history: The 
difficult legacy divisive forces: ethnic diversity, sectarianism, 
and social organization; Afghanistan in decline: the reforms of 
Dost Mohammad and Sher Ali; European imperialism and the Anglo-
Afghan wars; Abdul Rahman Khan: from anarchy to absolute monarchy; 
Mahmud Tarzi and 'Siraj al Akhbar'; Habibullah Khan: the quest for 
absolutism and modernism; The rise of Afghan nationalism; Amanullah 
Khan, ill-fated champion of modernization; Bacha-i-Saqao, the 
Bandit Amir; Nadir Shah: from anarchy to selective modernization; 
Nadir Shah: foreign policy; Hashim Khan: nationalism and 
gradualism; Hashim Khan: foreign policy.

The wild Bacha-i-Saqao's hold on the throne lasted from January 17 
to October 13, 1929, during which time political anarchy was 
rampant and the economy severely dislocated. He attacked 
Amanullah's 'sacrilegious and impious acts' and promised his people 
a complete return to the principles of the Quran and the Shariat 
law, the re-establishment of ancient customs regarding the status 
of women (he believed in going backwards), and the function of 
education as he knew it.

He halted Amanullah's progressive measures; all the modern schools 
were closed, female students were recalled from Turkey, foreign 
advizors were forced to leave Kabul, and polygamy laws were 
reinstated. Laboratories, libraries, palaces and the Royal Museum 
in Kabul were all sacked. (The Kabul museum has been sacked many 
times since).

Gregorian has quoted from the Afghan historian Muhammad Ali: "Rare 
books and articles of value were either destroyed, burnt or sold at 
ridiculous prices. For one Kran down, one could buy as many books 
as one could carry on one's shoulders . . . . confiscation of 
property, exile, or simple death were deemed uncommon instances of 
leniency. Most of the unfortunate victims were either blown up from 
the cannon's mouth or shot down; others were beaten, bastinadoed, 
impaled, bayoneted, or starved to death ... Bacha's chief victims 
were the officials of Amanullah Khan and wealthy merchants or 
influential or learned men..... He suspected the students most and 
regarded them as his secret enemies."

His destruction even extended to the felling of trees. He also 
dissolved the ministries of education and justice, "both of which 
were regarded as unnecessary and unwelcome infringements on the 
power of the religious establishment. The sole responsibility for 
the courts and schools reverted to the religious leadership."

Zahir Shah ascended the Afghan throne on November 8, 1933. He was 
born in Kabul and attended Habibia and Istiqlal and later, during 
his father's stay in France, several French lycees. Upon his return 
to Afghanistan, he graduated from the military school in Kabul. 
When aged eighteen his father appointed him minister of defence and 
the acting minister of education, "in order," writes Vartan, "that 
he might become familiar with the arts of government and the 
administration of the state."

The real power, it is said, lay in the hands of his three paternal 
uncles, Shah Mahmud Khan, Shah Wali Khan, and particularly Mohammad 
Hashim Khan, who as prime minister assumed complete control of the 
country's domestic and foreign policies."

Hashim attempted to convey to all that Islam was the religion of 
reform and progress and was not confined to literary and historical 
journals. He went so far as to maintain that "faith was a matter of 
individual conscience and heart and the intimate relationship 
between man and his Creator no man has a right to disturb."

He and his government also championed the right of Afghan girls to 
receive an appropriate education, for "....as future mothers they 
were responsible for the moral education of Afghan youth, and 
therefore their education was essential to the welfare of the 
Muslim community and the strength of Afghanistan ..... The major 
concern of Hashim's modernists was to reconcile Islam with 
modernization and to neutralize the opposition of the Muslim 
religious establishment." All these attempts to move forward and 
all the forward-looking policies died when Zahir Shah was forced to 
leave his country in 1973.

Of necessity grants and aid will now flow into Pakistan, and this 
is where Musharraf has to ensure that the men in power and 
position, be they in or out of uniform (many of whom are already 
rubbing their hands gleefully) are not struck with the predominant 
vice of corruption. 

For each man of ours disbursing money or weapons or goods, there 
must be another man from the donor agency conjointly responsible 
for the disbursement. We will have to leave it to good fortune that 
neither of the two is able to corrupt the other.

We do not wish to be and we should not be a party to killing the 
poor Afghans, by now thoroughly exhausted, and sick and tired of 
the Taliban. Many Afghan children have been born in refugee camps 
and are now some ten years old. Their health and welfare has been 
ignored both by us and the West.

These camps, if in Afghan territory, must be regarded as war-free 
zones, and schools must be established in all the camps wherever 
situated so that the children's minds can be formed correctly and 
in tune with the 21st century. It takes ten years to form a child's 
mind and bigotry cannot be abolished without education. There is 
time. We are in for a long difficult haul.

Musharraf is performing a tightrope act, and walking a very slack 
rope. He must be supported - to employ that misused and abused term 
- in the national interest.

<a name="ames">A mess of pottage</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

We are caught in the whirl of events over which we have no control. 
We are not calling the shots in the war raging in Afghanistan. Yet 
such is our intrepidity, or wishfulness, that we think we'll call 
the shots when it comes to imposing peace in that country.

However much we inveigh against the so-called Northern Alliance, if 
it suits the Americans they'll use it, and tell us in private not 
to worry. The American approach to war is distant and sanitized. 
Bombing from the skies is one thing, risking casualties on the 
ground quite another. If the Northern Alliance is prepared to do 
the messy groundwork, no one is going to ask Pakistan if it has any 
objections.

As for the shape of things to come, it is delusion on our part to 
suppose our wishes will be heeded when the shooting stops. A broad-
based government, yes, for it takes no extraordinary wisdom to see 
that anything less will only invite more strife and mayhem in that 
war-torn country. But for our detailed prescriptions there will not 
be much patience.

When the Americans decided to call it quits in Afghanistan back in 
the eighties they did not spend much time consulting General Zia 
about the modalities even though in the prosecution of that 
particular jihad he had been their most critical ally.

Forget Zia. Even the great Churchill found himself losing 
importance as the Second World War drew to a close. Reflecting the 
respective power of their countries, the key players were Roosevelt 
and Stalin and it is their voices which counted when it came to 
drawing up the contours of the post-war world.

Here we have had to change course literally overnight and give up 
on an Afghan policy of almost 20 years' standing - because we could 
not face the heat and pressure coming from Washington. Yet we think 
that once the firing stops our concerns, expressed so eloquently by 
the thrice-empowered Generalissimo, will be kept in mind when it 
comes to government-forming in Afghanistan.

It is no business of ours to talk of a 'friendly' government there. 
For by doing so we sound patronizing and interfering and thereby 
cause offence to Afghan ears. That we have to live with 
Afghanistan, and Afghanistan with us, is a compulsion of geography. 
We should be satisfied with that and leave other notions of 
strategy to the largest rubbish bin in GHQ.

During the Soviet occupation we played our part in keeping the 
Afghan resistance fragmented because a united leadership was not 
suited to the ISI's ambitions. We played favorites and propped up 
Hekmatyar, thereby earning the enmity of other leaders. Only when 
Hikmetyar proved a military failure, but not before destroying much 
of Kabul through ferocious rocket attacks, did we shift our focus 
to the Taliban. Where did all this frenzied interference get us? 
Even so, twenty years down the line we are still chanting the 
mantra of a friendly regime in Afghanistan.

For our cooperation extracted under pressure we have already 
received our price. From the fringes of the international community 
General Musharraf has been transported to centre-stage, receiving 
telephone calls from Bush and Powell and a certificate of approval 
from Tony Blair. Most American sanctions have been lifted, although 
what this means in practical terms remains unclear, while the IMF 
looks set to cast an indulgent eye on Pakistan's economic woes.

Furthermore, a few loans have been rescheduled. President Bush has 
gifted Pakistan 50 million dollars, which roughly would be the cost 
of bombing Afghanistan for three or four days. That's about it. No 
debt write-offs, none of the financial bonanza some of our keen-
eyed enthusiasts were expecting. Even the Americans, who are not 
averse to buying their way out of trouble, would be surprised at 
this cheap bargain: the cooperation of a vital country for a few 
crumbs of comfort.

But Pakistan is not complaining. Having lived for years as a near-
international outcast we are grateful for the attention we are 
getting. The refrain on the lips of the liberati is that we have 
rejoined the international mainstream. Even if Britain is 
irrelevant to our circumstances, and has been so for the last forty 
years, we were happy about Blair's visit. Among the sops he threw 
our way was the declaration that military cooperation with Pakistan 
stood revived. For the Army School of Music in Abbottabad we were 
probably getting bagpipes and other instruments from Britain. About 
anything else it is hard to say although Blair, when he referred to 
military cooperation, almost sounded as if he was giving us half 
the British fleet.

We are happy, above all, that we are not the target of American 
anger. How the notion of destruction entered our minds is a mystery 
but the fact remains that when Bush and Powell were drawing the 
line between friend and foe - either you are with us or with the 
enemy - Pakistani resolve collapsed. We thought that if we did not 
make haste American cruise missiles would rain down on us.

Granted there was the factor of India. With a dignity and sense of 
self-respect which can only be compared to ours, India was offering 
everything to the US (in Arundhati Roy's evocative words "furiously 
gyrating her hips" in order to catch American attention). Still, 
should we have panicked so quickly? Or convinced ourselves that the 
slightest hesitation would invite swift and terrible American 
retribution? This is no exaggeration. In the immediate aftermath of 
September 11 the one plaintive question on the lips of the 
chattering classes was, 'what choice do we have'?

But all this is water under the bridge. We have signed up for loyal 
service and have received our wages, there being room now neither 
for complaining nor second thoughts. Our brave cries about the 
desirability of a 'friendly government' in Afghanistan are more in 
the nature of self-assurance than a clear message to the US, the 
wish clearly passing muster for the deed.

To explain all this General Musharraf has brandished the stick of 
(sic)'national interest' (making do without the definite article 
when intoning these words). Everything has been done in 'national 
interest'. As if the national interest is a sacred scroll whose 
text only the general can read. Or a hallowed collection of bones 
locked in a deep chest to which only he has the key.

It is a moot point, however, whether military leaders aspiring to 
legitimacy or longevity (often interchangeable concepts) are the 
best keepers of the national flame. The short-cut they have taken 
to power makes legitimacy and acceptance prime if not overriding 
necessities. Afghanistan in the eighties transformed Zia from 
pariah to respected statesman. Twenty odd years on a different set 
of events in Afghanistan has brought much the same reward for 
General Musharraf. Which is not to say he has sacrificed the 
national interest for personal gain. Far from it. But in a 
situation as confused and uncertain as ours, it is often hard to 
figure out where personal advantage ends and the larger good 
begins.

The timing of two events has certainly worked to General 
Musharraf's advantage. Under the cover of the Agra summit he 
quietly made himself president. His elevation was good for him. It 
has meant little for the nation whose affairs remain as confused as 
before. Now under the cover of the war clouds over Afghanistan he 
has given himself an open-ended extension as army chief and also 
reshuffled the army command.

All the coup-makers who stood by him on October 12 two years ago 
are out. Lt General Aziz has exchanged his seat round the power 
table for four-star pomp and irrelevance. Mahmood and Usmani have 
once again proved the dictum that power brooks neither rivals nor a 
sense of obligation. No ruler, much less an authoritarian figure, 
likes living under a shadow of gratitude. Moreover, collaborators 
(those who have been helpful in the acquisition of power) make for 
uneasy subordinates because they claim too much for themselves. 
>From Ayub to Musharraf, with Bhutto and Zia in between, this has 
been one of the defining themes of Pakistani politics.

No doubt policy differences over Afghanistan have also played their 
part in this reshuffle. The theocrats of the army command, those 
who believed in the virtues of jihad, are out. The army is now set 
on a different course, which is the one benefit to the nation from 
the present roll of events.

<a name="them">The moment of truth</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

Every once in a while in a nation's history, it is faced with a 
defining moment in which its course is determined for years to 
come.

For Pakistan, this critical juncture arrived in the aftermath of 
the 1970 elections: a series of disastrous decisions by politicians 
and generals precipitated a bloody civil war which ended in a 
humiliating military defeat for Pakistan and the secession of its 
eastern wing. We were next faced with such a moment after the 
flawed 1977 elections: had Zulfikar Ali Bhutto immediately agreed 
to fresh polls, he would have denied the army an excuse to stage a 
coup and spared us a decade of Zia's crippling Islamization that 
haunts us still.

These are the ifs and buts of history, and historians will no doubt 
debate the fallout of those distant events for years to come. But 
the consequences of the September 11 terror attacks on America are 
much more immediate. While the world struggles to come to terms 
with those gruesome acts and their still murky aftermath, Pakistan 
was faced with its moment of truth immediately after the mayhem in 
New York and Washington just a month ago.

So far, General Musharraf has taken the right decisions and made 
all the right moves. Perceptibly, his resolve has hardened. This 
firmness was evident in the ruthless manner in which he rid the 
army high command of generals known for their fundamentalist views. 
By manoeuvring officers loyal to him into key positions, he has 
secured his flanks. Clearly, he could not keep people on his team 
who were identified with Pakistan's failed pro-Taliban policy. 
However, this spring-cleaning is also due to our intelligence 
agencies that have been propping up the medieval regime in 
Afghanistan: many officers have established close personal links 
with the Taliban leadership, and need to be eased out so that their 
organizations can better respond to the dramatically altered 
environment after September 11.

Changing a deeply entrenched policy is a bit like changing a large 
ship's course: it takes time for the bow to respond to the 
helmsman. For the last quarter century, Pakistan has been drifting 
away from the course of rational self-interest and basing its 
policies on ideological abstractions divorced from reality. When 
Zia boasted that he would make Pakistan "a laboratory of Islam", he 
was as good as his word. A series of failed experiments have pushed 
Pakistan toward financial bankruptcy and international isolation. 
>From declaring interest un-Islamic to supporting the Taliban next 
door, successive leaders have done little but confuse and 
demoralize the nation. Sectarian and ethnic parties and terrorists 
have moved into this moral and intellectual vacuum.

Now, after the massive jolt provided by the events of September 11, 
there is a real opportunity to move away from the disastrous 
policies of the past. General Musharraf was clear in his recent 
impressive press conference that Pakistan's taliban policy would 
have to be abandoned in the light of the changed environment. This 
pragmatic approach was also evident in his acceptance of a possible 
role for Zahir Shah in the post-Taliban dispensation. The ex-king 
of Afghanistan had earlier been anathema to the Pakistani 
establishment.

It is this rationality and ability to call a spade a spade that 
distinguishes General Musharraf from his undistinguished 
predecessors. A leader must be able to spot dangers and 
opportunities, avoiding the former and seizing the latter. By 
aligning himself with the global alliance against terror, he has 
avoided the certain isolation that would have followed had he tried 
to sit on the fence. By doing so, he has taken on the fanatics and 
their fury is evident but containable. After years of being 
covertly encouraged in their madness by short-sighted members of 
the establishment, they feel suddenly betrayed.

But to put things in perspective, many of the contorted, bearded 
faces on our TV screens belong to Afghan refugees who are 
committing acts of violence in Pakistani cities. While Iran 
isolated its Afghan refugees in camps near the border, Zia allowed 
ours to go anywhere they pleased. Their presence in the major 
cities provides extremist parties with foot soldiers while 
injecting a further element of instability into our polity. All 
over the world, foreign nationals breaking local laws are deported. 
Why can't our vast law and order apparatus at least put disorderly 
refugees into camps far from the cities?

Pakistan's transformation from a backward and violent country of 
armed zealots into a moderate Muslim state will take time and 
political will. Above all, it will take strong nerves and an iron 
fist. But it is a task made easier by the knowledge that extremist 
religious parties have never won more than five per cent of the 
popular vote. The interior minister has been making well meaning 
but ineffectual noises about reining in jihadis and sundry 
militants. With the recent ouster of hard-line generals from 
positions of power, it will be easier to tackle these armed and 
dangerous groups.

But we must face the fact that without a resolution of the Kashmir 
issue, thee will always be a cause for homegrown terrorists to 
rally around. While the conflict may be a freedom struggle for 
Kashmiri militants, there has clearly been cross-border support by 
Pakistan-based groups. In the changed international environment, 
this kind of activity will be branded as support for terrorism and 
the Pakistan government will be held accountable for the actions of 
its citizens.

At Agra, General Musharraf showed more flexibility than any of his 
predecessors by accepting the possibility of a 'third option' - an 
independent Kashmir. India must explore the contours of a possible 
solution based on such a formula. For far too long have 
politicians, journalists and generals in Islamabad and New Delhi 
been locked in their respective rigid positions, unable to think 
creatively on this vexed issue that has held the entire 
subcontinent hostage, and cost untold lives and treasure. The 
Pakistani leader's recent telephone call to the Indian prime 
minister was an excellent move to break the deadlock. Both sides 
need to build on the progress made at Agra. Hardliners on both 
sides need to be reined in, and verbal hair-splitting must not be 
allowed to torpedo future talks.

Other steps are required to exorcise the spectre of intolerance 
that stalks the land. First and foremost, we need to reintegrate 
our sundered minorities into the mainstream. For far too long have 
they been oppressed and unfairly marginalized. The hateful system 
of separate electorate must go, and the controversial blasphemy law 
needs to be reviewed. Similarly, laws that discriminate against 
women should be repealed. In short, Zia's poisonous legacy must be 
shed if we are to progress.

A month ago, the world changed. For better or for worse only time 
will tell. Meanwhile, there are dangers and opportunities for all 
nations. Pakistan has made a good start in avoiding the former; we 
must now capitalize on the latter by returning to the comity of 
nations as a modern, progressive state where all citizens are equal 
before the law.

<a name="muda">Mudassar named coach, Akram banned</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 11: Mudassar Nazar was confirmed as Pakistan coach 
until the two-Test tour to Bangladesh in place of Richard Pybus who 
earlier in the week turned his back citing security concerns in 
South Asia.

Sikander Bakht, who served as Pybus' deputy in August for the Asian 
Test Championship, was appointed assistant coach but only for this 
month's Sharjah Cup which will run between Oct 26 and Nov 4.

Mudassar, who also coached Pakistan on the 1992-93 tour to the West 
Indies, is the 10th coach since 1997. Others are Haroon Rasheed, 
Mushtaq Mohammad (twice), Javed Miandad (twice), Wasim Raja, 
Richard Pybus (twice) and Intikhab Alam. "It is a great honor to be 
appointed coach of the multi- talented team which, I believe, has 
more ability than it has been performing in the recent past," the 
former Test opener said from Lahore.

"Although little over three months is a very short time but I will 
give my best to the team because for me, success is everything. "I 
see this appointment as the stepping stone for a permanent 
assignment with the Pakistan team," Mudassar, who played 76 Tests 
and earned the tag of Man with the Golden Arm, added.

<a name="next">Next ACC meeting at Sharjah in November</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 10: A meeting of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) due 
to be held in Kuala Lumpur later this month has been rescheduled 
for November and will now take place in Sharjah.

Zakir Hussain Syed, secretary of the ACC told Dawn that the meeting 
is now set for Nov 2-3 and had been moved from Kuala Lumpur after 
some delegates requested for a change of venue. The meeting, 
originally scheduled for Lahore on Oct 20 and 21, was shifted out 
of Pakistan in the aftermath of the terrorists strikes in the 
United States.

The ACC meeting will consist of two parts with the first session 
comprising the adjourned Annual General Meeting in London on June 
20 approving the audited statement of accounts and budget. 

The second part, which will be the special general meeting, will 
discuss the situation arising following India's withdrawal from the 
Asian Test Championship and measures to avoid this happening in 
future.

India had refused to travel to Lahore for a match of that 
championship against Pakistan which was to start late last month, a 
decision that resulted in the host board suffering heavy losses. 
The Indians had also said 'no' to a Test series in Pakistan last 
December.

The Sharjah meeting, will also decide on a permanent structure of 
governance on the pattern of the International Cricket Council 
(ICC). Also on the agenda is the setting up of an ACC secretariat 
either in UAE, Nepal or Malaysia.

<a name="iccm">ICC may reschedule Pakistan Tests on neutral venues</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, Oct 8: International Cricket Council (ICC) president 
Malcolm Gray admitted that Pakistan's home Test matches could have 
to be played on foreign soil following safety concerns arising from 
United States and British military action in neighboring 
Afghanistan.

"Obviously the current situation is a huge problem," Gray said at 
the launch of the ICC's new logo at Lord's. "Our hope is that it 
might be short and sharp and we can get over it quickly. But if the 
situation continues it will cause enormous problems logistically 
and financially for the game."

New Zealand and Sri Lanka have already cancelled tours to Pakistan 
because of turmoil caused there by the terrorist incidents in the 
United States and the subsequent military response.

The ICC want to keep Pakistan playing international cricket and 
Gray said: "It's possible their home matches could be played at 
independent venues if that becomes necessary. "Nothing has been 
decided but it's something we are looking closely at.

"A number of political situations are affecting the world of 
cricket. Ideally, all ICC members should be free to play against 
each other, unconstrained by events and decisions outside their 
control. "In reality however, international cricket in India, 
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe is currently being affected by 
political decisions and horrific uncertainties."-AFP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 6: Test rejects Mohammad Ramzan and Mohammad Wasim 
struck identical centuries for KRL as Pakistan Public Works 
Department (PWD) took first innings points in the drawn Patron's 
Trophy Grade-I match at Jinnah Stadium in Sialkot.

According to details available were, Wasim was out for 123 after 
dominating the opening partnership of 193 with Ramzan, who finished 
unbeaten on 123 in KRL's second innings score of 315 for one.

Saeed bin Nasir was the other not out batsman with 52 to his credit 
in the unbroken second wicket stand of 122 with Ramzan. Earlier, 
PWD extended their first innings lead to 135 by reaching a mammoth 
592 in reply to KRL's 457. Iqbal Imam, who resumed on 83 in the 
overnight score of 544 for eight, became the second batsman in 
PWD's innings to reach a century. Iqbal, the left-hander, made 114 
off 190 balls in stay of 244 minutes. 

Part-time off-spinner Intikhab Alam claimed both the wickets that 
fell. By far the most successful bowler for KRL was Yasir Arafat, 
whose final analysis were six for 166 in 34 overs while Shoaib 
Akhtar, the Test speedster, had only one wicket in the innings for 
85 runs in 28 overs.
