<a name="isla">Islamabad, Delhi vow to build up confidence</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
COLOMBO, Aug 10: Pakistan and India discussed nuclear tensions, and
vowed to build "trust and confidence" in their first talks since
the Agra summit failed to end a deadlock over the Kashmir dispute.

The foreign secretaries of the two countries described their 75-
minute closed-door talks as "friendly and very useful" in building
on the process begun at the summit. India's top diplomat Chokila
Iyer warmly shook hands with her Pakistan counterpart Inamul Haq as
they went into the talks on the sidelines of a Saarc (South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation) meeting here.

"There is determination on both sides to resolve issues that
separate us and remove impediments to the improvement of
relations," Mr Haq said after the talks. He said the meeting itself
was an indication that the two countries wanted to take forward the
process begun by Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and President
Pervez Musharraf at the summit.

"This (meeting in Colombo) in itself should be rated as progress,"
he added. Ms Iyer too said she was upbeat about the meeting and
reiterated the talks with Mr Haq had been "very useful".

"We had a very useful exchange of views," she said. "We discussed
the importance of continuing the dialogue process started by my
prime minister by inviting President Musharraf to the summit at
Agra. "It is important that we continue the dialogue process."

An Indian diplomat said Ms Iyer had asked Mr Haq that India was
awaiting a response from Islamabad to its offer to send a senior
military official to discuss military-to-military contacts. Mr Haq
told Ms Iyer another proposal to send a group of experts to
Pakistan to discuss nuclear risk reduction was also under active
consideration, the diplomat said.

While both sides emphasized the "positive atmosphere" at the talks,
it was clear that they were sticking to their respective positions
on issues like Kashmir. At a press briefing, Ms Iyer said the issue
of Kashmir had figured in the talks but said it would not determine
the progress of bilateral ties.

"We reject that Jammu and Kashmir is the core issue ... it is not
the central point for the improvement of relations," she said,
adding New Delhi wanted broad-based ties with Islamabad.

Mr Haq reiterated that Kashmir was the problem impeding India-
Pakistan relations. A statement circulated by India said Ms Iyer
had raised the issue of "cross-border terrorism" with Pakistan. It
said: "We cannot accept the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir with
its foreign mercenaries and generous assistance from abroad is
anything but cross-border terrorism.

"The daily killing of innocent men, women and children cannot be
glorified as Jihad," it added. An Indian diplomat said: "The
Pakistani side dismissed the killings as the work of renegade
elements."

Talking to reporters, Mr Haq said cross-border terrorism was a
"pejorative word". "Jammu and Kashmir is the issue that needs to be
resolved." Both sides said dates had yet to be worked out for
future meetings between Indian and Pakistani leaders at the
political level.

<a name="chin">Chinese aspect did not figure at talks: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Aug 8: Pakistan rejected the allegations made by Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in parliament, criticizing
President Pervez Musharraf's presentation of Islamabad's stand on
Jammu and Kashmir at the Agra summit.

Responding to Mr Vajpayee's statement, the foreign office spokesman
reiterated the "position of the government of Pakistan that
misrepresentations and intemperate remarks could neither alter
reality nor promote the cause of normalization of relations"
between the two countries.

The spokesman rejected Mr Vajpayee's charge about cross-border
terrorism and described it "an attempt to denigrate the Kashmir
freedom struggle and to draw away from the massive violations of
human rights of the Kashmiri people by the Indian forces." The
spokesman underlined that President Musharraf had, in his talks
with Prime Minister Vajpayee, "emphasized the centrality of the
Kashmir dispute. The president had expressed his readiness to
discuss all other outstanding issues as well."

The spokesman described Mr Vajpayee's contention that no election
had ever been held in Azad Kashmir as an "incredible display of
lack of knowledge" of the situation. He added that elections had
regularly been held in Azad Kashmir and unlike the fraudulent
elections in Indian-held Kashmir, their validity had not been
contested.

As regards Mr Vajpayee's remarks about the Pakistan-China border
agreement of 1963, the spokesman stated that "no such discussion
took place at any stage. The Indian prime minister's outrageous
claim is, therefore, a figment of his imagination". The spokesman
noted that "there were many other elements in Mr Vajpayee's
statement, which bore no resemblance to reality. However, Pakistan
does not wish to engage in a diatribe with India."

<a name="ceof">CE offered to retake land ceded to China: Vajpayee</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Aug 7: President Pervez Musharraf has offered to take
back the part of Kashmir ceded by Pakistan to China in 1963 if an
agreement is reached with India to resolve the 54-year-old dispute,
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee told parliament.

Vajpayee used his reply to the discussion on the Agra Summit in the
Lok Sabha to tell Gen Musharraf that he must curb what India calls
cross-border terrorism in Kashmir for progress on future talks over
the Himalayan region. But he said the peace process would continue
anyway in other areas.

Vajpayee said he reminded Musharraf during their Agra talks that
"Pakistan has given away our territory to China. By what authority
did they give it away? He said never mind, if we succeed in an
agreement (on Kashmir), we will take back the land from China. I
said no one will trust you with that. Therefore please accept
reality." Indian politicians have accused China in the past of
illegally holding the area in the Shaksgam Valley that was ceded by
Pakistan. Analysts said this could be the first time that a
Pakistani leader has promised to take the territory back from
China.

India says China continues to be in illegal occupation of about
38,000 sq-km of Jammu and Kashmir, in addition to the 5,180 sq-km
of Indian territory that Pakistan ceded. Vajpayee said when he
asked Gen Musharraf to check cross-border terrorism in Kashmir he
replied that it was freedom struggle that was going on there. "I
said this was completely unacceptable to us. It was at this point
that the atmosphere was completely spoilt for the talks to
progress."

Vajpayee said there were violent incidents happening inside
Pakistan that were rooted in terrorism. "Terrorism is creating
problems for their government also," he said. Relations with
Pakistan were rarely even. There were ups and downs. "Sometimes
there is friendship, sometimes war and sometimes we have a cease-
fire. This is the brief story of our relations over 50 years,"
Vajpayee said. "Our effort is always to improve relations with
neighbouring countries."

Vajpayee said President Musharraf may have been influenced by the
assessment of some Pakistani journalists who thought that Kashmir
was like a ripe fruit waiting to be dropped into his lap. "There
should be no confusion here. India is ready to repulse any attack
and meet any challenge inside our territory."

Vajpayee said President Musharraf did not want to include the
Shimla and Lahore agreements in the draft declaration being
prepared in Agra. "In fact the name of Shimla appeared to spoil the
taste in his mouth. We said this won't do."

Vajpayee said Musharraf defended the invasion of Kashmir by
tribesmen in 1947. "I was surprised, I want to take the house into
confidence, when he said that had the tribals not attacked Kashmir
at that time, Pakistan would not have had even that part of
Kashmir. I said Kashmir might be a piece of territory for you, it
is a core of our lives."

"He said the other Pakistani leaders who had discussed Kashmir with
India had not pressed hard enough. I said if you are going to press
hard, the talks will stop just there." Vajpayee said he would not
close the door for talks. "We have spelt out our point of view.
Pakistan will have to respect it. I hope Pakistan too will change
its approach to the talks."

Monitoring desk

NEW DELHI, Aug 6: India said it would pursue the peace process with
Pakistan but warned Islamabad against continuing with "compulsive
and perpetual hostility" towards New Delhi.

"The caravan of peace is in motion. The dogs of war cannot deviate
this process," External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh was quoted
by the Press Trust of India website as having said during the
debate on the Agra summit in the Lok Sabha.

Mr Singh said Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and he had
accepted invitations to visit Pakistan dates for which would be
worked through mutual convenience. Giving an account of the Agra
summit, he said New Delhi had made it clear that occupied Kashmir
was at the core of the Indian nationhood and asserted that division
on religious grounds as propounded by the two-nation theory was not
acceptable to India.

India also told Pakistan that Islamabad's proposition that Kashmir
be treated as a "territorial dispute" was "totally unacceptable" to
it. Mr Singh cautioned Pakistan that its "encouragement to cross-
border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir would have grave consequences
in that country similar to the social and political anarchy that
was being witnessed in Afghanistan."

<a name="usme">US mediation on Kashmir opposed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 5: Chairperson of the Institute of Strategic
Studies, Islamabad (ISSI), Shireen Mazari has opposed American
mediation on Kashmir, saying that US intervention has not restored
peace in the Middle East and other parts of the world.

"Look at the Middle East, there was Camp David, Oslo, but what
happened? There is no peace in the Middle East. In fact, the
Palestinians cut off the military struggle prematurely because of
Camp David and Oslo. But they got no peace in return," Ms Mazari
told IRNA in an exclusive interview in Islamabad.

"The Americans want quick solutions, quick fixes. There are no
quick fixes. Look what the Americans have done in the Balkans, they
use NATO bombings in Kosovo. All intentions were to get rid of
Milosovic. Now they have got rid of Milosovic but the problem is
still there in the Balkans," she said.

She maintained that the Americans had achieved nothing even in
Northern Ireland as Clinton's intervention did not bring peace
there.

Opposing Pakistan's quest for American mediation on Kashmir, Ms
Mazari said it would be extremely negative, specially from
Pakistan's perspective. "I think we would make a big mistake if we
ask the Americans to mediate, she added."

Ms Mazari, however, said mediation on Kashmir could be done by the
United Nations, specially by the office of the secretary- general.

The chairperson of the Institute of Strategic Studies, Islamabad
favored continuation of armed struggle in occupied Kashmir because
it was pressure that would make India finally agree to have
dialogue with Pakistan.

"Pakistan does not like a lot of the things the Taliban are doing.
But it is difficult task to force the Afghans not to do what they
want to do.  "If you engage with the Taliban you can influence
them. If you push them into isolation, they will become more
extreme," she added.

Pointing out Pakistan's problems due to Afghan policy, she said,
the problem for Pakistan is that everybody, especially the West is
supporting anti-Taliban alliance.

The chairperson of the institute said there will not be stability
in Afghanistan and because there will be a stalemate as the
Northern Alliance is getting enough arms to cause military
stalemate. ''If the rest of the world destabilize Afghanistan, here
is a big problem".-NNI

<a name="usas">US assures Pakistan of fairness on curbs issue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Syed Talat Hussain

ISLAMABAD, Aug 6: The Bush administration is likely to lift
nuclear-related sanctions simultaneously against Pakistan and
India, senior government officials told Dawn.

During her visit to Pakistan, the US assistant secretary of state
for South Asian Affairs, Christina B. Rocca contradicted the
impression conveyed by some quarters that the US might use a
discriminatory approach in the lifting of the sanctions, removing
the curbs against India first and Pakistan later.

"We have been assured that the decision on the issue will be even-
handed," said an official. He, however, pointed out that while
India will immediately get out of the wring of sanctions, for
Pakistan the multi-layered nature of the nuclear-related sanctions
can cause problems.

"The simultaneous lifting of the sanctions will only take care of
curbs imposed under the Glenn amendment that came into effect after
Pakistan in response to India's nuclear tests carried out its own.
However, before Glenn, Pressler and Symington curbs were already in
place against Pakistan. Our effort now is to work towards getting
all three sets of sanctions lifted in one go," said the official.

The official said the Bush administration was looking at the entire
range of nuclear-related sanctions against Pakistan while doing the
review. "It is good for Pakistan as removing Glenn and not removing
Pressler, for instance, does not solve our problem. Our ties with
the US will still remain stuck in sanctions' mire" he said.

While the Brown Amendment of 1995 and the Harkin-Warner Amendment
of 1997 had considerably diluted the impact of the Pressler
Amendment, but even the remains of it considerably restrict US
economic, technical, business, and military aid assistance and
cooperation with regards to Pakistan. The official said that the
process of reaching a final decision will get accelerated in the
coming months, if not weeks.

"The relevant committees will look at them, and then the House
approval will be sought. However, as far as the Bush
administration's choice is concerned we are quite positive that
Glenn Amendment-related sanctions will be lifted," the official
said.

<a name="beim">Beijing denies sale of missile parts to Islamabad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
BEIJING, Aug 7: China denied a US newspaper report alleging it had
transferred a dozen batches of missile components to Pakistan in a
breach of a Sino-US non-proliferation accord.

A foreign ministry statement said the report in the Washington
Times newspaper was "not worth commenting on." "This American
newspaper always disseminates irresponsible and groundless rumor
aimed at slandering China as a proliferator," it said.

Quoting unnamed US intelligence sources, the Washington Times
reported US spy satellites had detected the latest shipment of
components as it arrived by trucks at the China-Pakistan border on
May 1.

The paper said the China National Machinery and Equipment Import
and Export Corporation supplied the components for Pakistan's
Shaheen-1 and Shaheen-2 missile programs. US intelligence agencies
have detected 12 such missile component transfers sent by ship and
truck, according to the paper, which has close contacts in the
intelligence community.

The alleged export of missiles and components by Chinese state
firms to potential US adversaries or unsettled regions of the world
is one of the most contentious issues in the fractious US-China
relationship.-AFP

<a name="expo">China exported missile parts to Pakistan: paper</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza

WASHINGTON, Aug 6: A US newspaper alleged that a Chinese state
company had transferred missile components to Pakistan. The
Washington Times said US satellites detected the latest shipment as
it arrived by truck at the Pakistan-China border on May 1.

The paper named the company as China National Machinery and
Equipment Import and Export Corporation and said it had supplied
the components for the Shaheen 1 and Shaheen 2 programs. The Times
said US intelligence agencies had detected 12 such missile
component transfers sent by ship and truck.

The US State Department refused to comment over the newspaper's
allegation, but said it remained concerned about what it called
Chinese transfer of systems like this to other countries. The
subject of such transfers was raised by US Secretary of State Colin
Powell with Chinese authorities during his visit to Beijing late
last month. According to the State Department, it forms part of the
overall context of the US-China relationship.

The anti-China right-wing has been critical of what it sees as the
secretary's appeasement of China and has suggested that this is
another area where there are policy differences between the State
Department and the White House.

The Washington Times report can be interpreted as being part of the
anti-Powell campaign by the conservative media. It insinuated that
China was asked to meet several specific conditions before Mr
Powell went to China, but had not done so and that the secretary
had, thus, gone ahead with his visit without obtaining any
guarantees on this score.

Asked if China's arms sales could trigger sanctions against Beijing
under US weapons proliferation laws, an official told The
Washington Times: "I can't speculate. None have come to my
attention at this point."

During his China visit, the report quoted another official as
saying, Secretary Powell "didn't sit there (in Beijing) and detail
the cases that we're concerned about with the Chinese. But they
have been refusing to have conversations or discussions, a dialogue
on export control and on proliferation .... We are not there yet
with the Chinese on what we really need to do on even getting a
process in place. And that's something we're going to be pressing
pretty hard on between now and the president's visit to Shanghai."

<a name="ceha">CE has no extra powers as president: LHC</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, Aug 10: The assumption of the office of president by the
chief executive does not enhance the CE's powers as the head of the
state was already bound to act on his advice during the period of
constitutional deviation, Justice Khalilur Rehman Ramday of the
Lahore High Court observed.

Dismissing a Pakistan Lawyers Forum petition challenging the CE's
orders 2 and 3 of 2001, dissolving parliament and provincial
assemblies and providing for the CE's induction as president as
being repugnant to the basic features of the Constitution,
including its parliamentary character, the judge declared that "the
assumption that any amendment has been made in the basic law is
fallacious".

Justice Ramday, who has already upheld the validity of the impugned
orders in a previous petition, observed that the present era is one
of "extraordinary constitutional deviation(s)" and a strict and
literal compliance with the letter of the law may not be possible.

The order said: "According to the provisions of para 3(1) of the
Provisional Constitution Order No. 1 of 1999, since validated, the
president was to act only on and in accordance with the advice of
the chief executive. Meaning thereby that the power of the
president to act in his discretion or to act in consolation with
certain designated authorities, stood withdrawn during this period
of Constitutional deviation and all executive powers thus got
vested in the chief executive. Therefore, assumption of the office
of president did not involve assumption of any power which did not
belong to the chief executive. Thus the submission that CE's order
No 2 or 3 had the effect of concentration of power in one person,
is misplaced.

It may be added that nothing could be demonstrated to exist which
could persuade me to hold that the impugned orders were in any way
detrimental to the good of the people or were an impediment in the
ordinary orderly running of the state or that the same were in any
way prejudicial to the attainment of the declared objectives of the
chief executive.

It is true that (the) hon'ble Supreme Court had, through para 270
of the judgment in Zafar Ali Shah's case declared its commitment to
the Constitutional and democratic governance of the country by the
people through their chosen representatives but at the same time,
it is also true that on account of the detailed reasons given by
their lordships, the Supreme Court had felt compelled to validate
intervention by the armed forces and had consequently permitted a
temporary deviation from the said mode of governance.

The petitioner needs to accept the fact that the present is the era
of an extra-ordinary constitutional deviation where, either on
account of the compulsion of the extra-ordinary circumstances or
because of the absence of the requisite infrastructure, as in the
present case, strict and literal compliance of the letter of the
Constitution, may not be possible. It may also be added that in the
matter of running the affairs of a state, the actions of the chief
executive, especially in a situation like the one in hand, could
not be judged on golden scales.

<a name="cjvi">CJ violating Constitution: SCBA</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 4: The Supreme Court Bar Association said that the
chief justice of Pakistan had violated the constitutional
provisions and the apex court's judgment by becoming the acting
president of the country and had "incurred disqualification to
remain chief justice any more."

In a resolution passed at the executive committee meeting, the
Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) said it had taken "serious
view" of the violation of Judges Case by the chief justice (CJ).
"The Judges Case is binding upon the chief justice and the
violation of the same is violation of Article 189 and 190 of the
Constitution of Pakistan."

It said: "This act (acting president) of the chief justice amounts
to contempt of the judgement of the Supreme Court." The meeting,
which was presided over by SCBA president Abdul Haleem Pirzada, was
attended by 17 members of the executive committee. They also
discussed the issue of administration of president's oath to Chief
Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf by Chief Justice Irshad Hasan Khan.

The SCBA resolution said the lawyers' community was deeply
disappointed and distressed and "widely condemned the event that
the chief justice of Pakistan had administered oath of office of
president to Gen Musharraf and took oath as acting president, and
by doing so has incurred disqualification to remain chief justice
of Pakistan any more."

It said no constitutional package providing for any amendment to
the Constitution, whatsoever, would be acceptable to the Bar, and
called upon the chief executive not to temper with the
Constitution, notwithstanding the judgement of the Supreme Court in
Zafar Ali Shah's case.

It further said no interference with the constitutional provisions
relating to the judiciary, whether pertaining to the appointment of
judges, age of retirement of the judges, or power and jurisdiction
of the courts, would be tolerated. It stated that assumption of
presidency by Gen Pervez Musharraf was clearly "unconstitutional"
and was indicative of the intention of the military rulers to
perpetuate themselves in power.

It said the Bar strongly felt that designation of the chief justice
and his assumption as acting president was clearly
"unconstitutional" and a violation of the principle of separation
of judiciary from the executive.

The SCBA resolved that it would challenge the assumption of office
of president by Gen Pervez Musharraf and administration of oath by
the chief justice under 184(3) of the Constitution, either jointly
with bar councils and high court bar associations or by itself, as
early as possible. In the second resolution, the SCBA took serious
exception of the chief justice's refusal to hand over two rooms on
the first floor of the SC building to the Bar.

Mr Pirzada informed the committee members that when he approached
the chief justice for the matter, the chief justice refused to
entertain the request in a highly objectionable manner. The EC took
serious exception to the remarks of the chief justice.

<a name="prov">Provide safe exit to Musharraf: Beg</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 7: Politicians must start developing a consensus for
providing a safe exit to Gen Pervez Musharraf when he will transfer
power next year. This was stated by Gen Mirza Aslam Beg (retired),
chief of Awami Qiadat Party, while addressing a press conference
here on Tuesday.

He said the parliament had approved 69 amendments to the
Constitution, including Article 58-2(b), and ratified all acts of
the martial law regime before President Ziaul Haq transferred power
to the government headed by Muhammad Khan Junejo. Gen Musharraf
would not be an exception, Mr Beg said.

"He needs indemnity laws. An insurance policy before transferring
power to civilians. It is up to the politicians to provide him with
an escape route if they want a smooth transition," he said. Mr Beg
predicted that the next set-up would suffer from inherent problem
of pulls and pushes from different sides because not a single party
was going to win next elections. This situation puts an added
responsibility on politicians to develop some kind of agreement for
running the country in the future, Mr Beg said, adding that the
absence of such a consensus would make things difficult for the
nation.

About allegations of armymen meddling with polls to ensure election
of "right candidates" and its possible resulting in the division of
the army, he said: "The establishment's interference in the
elections has always backfired. The same will happen this time.
Look at Azhar Saeed Butt's case. He was virtually living with the
114 Brigade but lost elections. I don't think that a wishful
thinking of getting "desirable candidate" elected works. Let the
army play its hand and see the results for itself."

He did not agree with Qazi Hussain Ahmad's assertion that army's
role in elections can create divisions in it. "The army works as an
institution. There is no dissent in it nor one should fear for
one." He also expressed his fears for weakening of two main
political parties -- the PPP and the PML -- and their diminishing
role in the national politics. This does not augur well for the
future of democracy in the country, he said. About the recent Agra
Summit, Mr Beg hinted at "some kind of behind-the-scene
understanding." Dilating upon his explanation of the secret
agreement, he said that it could revolve around what Chaudhry
Shujaat had asserted -- division of Kashmir along the Line of
Control -- when he was in the US. But, he warned, that no solution
could work unless approved, and participated in, by the mujahideen
and the All Party Hurriyat Conference. The government should not
make the mistake of ignoring the Kashmiris in any future set-up.

The US is pushing both countries towards a solution because it is
scared of rapidly increasing Chinese influence in the region and
wants to counter it by manufacturing a solution to Kashmir, the
retired general said. The Chinese investment in the Gwadar port and
a highway along the Arabian sea is part of its long-term strategic
goals. During the next decade, China would be importing 80 per cent
of its oil from the Gulf and through Pakistan. Instead of seeking a
guarantee from Pakistan, it was developing its own infrastructure
there, Beg added.

He also feared for the future of Afghanistan. "Pakistan is really
in a bind on this issue. It can neither ignore nor interfere in
Afghanistan without incurring a heavy diplomatic cost. Taliban are
the real rulers of Afghanistan but protecting and projecting them
would cost dearly to our country. Pakistan must develop a long-term
policy to deal with the Afghan issue," he said.

<a name="dela">Provinces delay views on $130m ADB loan offer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Aug 6: The provinces have not responded to the federal
government's query whether the ADB soft loan offer of US $130
million for judicial reforms should be accepted or not. All the
provinces were required to give their views by July 28, but even
after a lapse of over a week, they have not furnished their
replies.

It was learnt from official sources that the federal government had
decided to write to the provinces to solicit their views at the
earliest so that it could reply to the lenders. An appraisal
mission of the ADB is coming to the federal capital in the next
fortnight to discuss the details of Access to Justice Program for
which it has offered soft loan of US $130 million. All the four
high courts have opposed the creation of Judicial Ombudsman under
the ADB's judicial reform program in the country.

The idea of Judicial Ombudsman was discussed at length by the
representatives of the provincial governments in a recent meeting
held in Islamabad, presided by Secretary Law and Justice. The
representatives of the provincial governments were of the view that
the function of Judicial Ombudsman was being performed by the
Inspection Teams headed by the judges of the high court and there
was no need for multiplication of the institutions.

The meeting headed by law and justice secretary was attended by the
secretary finance, registrars of all the high courts, finance and
law secretaries from the provinces. It had been recommended by the
consultants of Access to Justice Program (AJP) the office of
Judicial Ombudsman, headed by a high court judge, should assume the
role of coordinating the program's activities in each province of
the country.

Under the plan, Judicial Ombudsman would be responsible for
producing an annual report on the status of the judiciary in the
province. The report would include statistics, analysis of the
problems faced by the judicial systems and proposed solutions
including legislative reforms.

The proposal is that the ombudsman would work closely with the
registrar and inspection team on responding to complaints lodged by
the citizens, litigants or lawyers and would include in the annual
report a listing of all complaints received and the solution
provided to the complainants. If the loan offer is accepted, it
would be mandatory for the government to enact Freedom of
Information Law, allowing the citizens to have access to public
information.

<a name="nabe">NAB empowered to get details of bank accounts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Arshad Sharif

ISLAMABAD, Aug 10: The government amended the National
Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999, making it mandatory for the
banks and financial institutions to provide information about
accounts of any individual.

The amended law also empowers the NAB chairman to conduct
surveillance of any person to be used as evidence in a trail.
Amending section 19 of the Ordinance, the National Accountability
Bureau (Amendment) Ordinance 2001 requires all banks and financial
institutions to provide any information relating to any person,
including copies of entries made in a bank or financial
institution's books, record of information and transactions saved
in electronic or digital form. The keepers of the books and records
shall be obliged to certify the copies in accordance with the law,
according to the provision of the Ordinance.

Under the amended NAB Ordinance 2001, documents or any other
material transferred to Pakistan by any foreign government shall be
receivable as evidence in legal proceedings notwithstanding
anything contained in the Qanun-i-Shahadat Order, 1984 or any other
law for the time being in force.

Where there is any reasonable suspicion that any person is involved
in or is privy to an offence, the NAB chairman may, with the
approval in writing of a high court concerned, direct that
surveillance of that person may be carried out through such means
as may be necessary in the facts and circumstances of the case.

The ordinance further states that the information so collected may
be used as evidence in the trial under the Ordinance. However, it
added that the copies obtained or information received or evidence
collected shall be confidential and not used for any purpose other
than for legal proceedings under the NAB Ordinance.

The government, while implementing the unanimous verdict of the
Supreme Court on NAB Ordinance 1999, has reduced the
disqualification period of convicts who held the public office from
21 years to ten years in the NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2001.

"Where an accused person is convicted for the offence of corruption
or corrupt practices, he shall forthwith cease to hold public
office, if any, held by him and stand disqualified for a period of
ten years, to be reckoned from the date he is released after
serving the sentence, for seeking or from being elected, chosen,
appointed or nominated as a member or representative of any public
body or any statutory or local authority or in service of Pakistan
or of any Province."

The amended Ordinance while defining the procedure for appointment
of chairman NAB states that the chairman NAB shall be appointed by
the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of Pakistan
for a period of three years on such terms and conditions as may be
determined by the President and shall not be removed from service
except on the grounds of removal of a Supreme Court Judge.

About removal of the deputy chairman NAB, the Ordinance states that
he can only be removed on grounds of misconduct as defined in the
Government Servants Efficiency and Discipline Rules of 1973.

Laying down the procedure for appointment of Accountability Judges
in line with the SC directives, the NAB (Amendment) Ordinance 2001
states that an Accountability Court shall consist of a Judge who
shall be appointed by the President of Pakistan in consultation
with the Chief Justice of the High Court concerned and shall hold
office for a period of three years on terms and conditions as may
be determined by the President.

<a name="fire">Fire destroys ICP offices in NBP headquarters</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Bahzad Alam Khan

KARACHI, Aug 9: At least one person died as a fire gutted the
headquarters of the Investment Corporation of Pakistan. "The record
of the ICP as well as furniture and computers were completely
destroyed," the chief fire officer of the fire brigade services of
the KMC, Attaur Rehman, said.

Though the fire broke out at around 9.30pm, no serious attempt was
made to extinguish it by 10.45pm as the first effort of using a
snorkel failed because the water thrown with it could reach only
the 6th floor. The deputy commissioner of the South district,
Shoaib Siddiqi, said the NBP had rented out the top floor to the
ICP. He added that at the moment it was hard to ascertain the cause
of the fire. He said the situation was in control.

According to official sources the ICP, whose paid-up capital is
around Rs2.5 billion, has 26 mutual funds. It has been operating at
a loss as all the sum is invested in the stock market and its share
prices are quoted at huge discount to the par value. They added
that the government was considering merging the ICP with the
National Investment Trust so that they could be privatized
afterwards. The employees of the ICP were opposing the
privatization move. With the burning of the ICP record, the
investors would make a run for the invested money, taking advantage
of the absence of the record.

<a name="cefo">CE for transparent sell-off process</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 9: President Gen Pervez Musharraf directed the
Privatization Commission to speed up the sell-off process and make
it "fully transparent". He told the privatization minister to look
into the possibility of extending 5 per cent shares of commercial
banks and state enterprises to people with a view to broadening
their ownership.

The directives came at a meeting presided over by the president.
The meeting was held to review the performance of the Privatization
Commission.

"The president was informed that nine oil wells, the PTCL and the
UBL will be privatized by the end of 2001 as all the spadework in
this behalf has been completed. Then, in very near future, Pakistan
State Oil, Oil and Gas Development Company, and Pakistan Petroleum
will be disinvested." Mr Saleem said the president had expressed
satisfaction over the performance of the Privatization Commission.

He said the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation would be privatized
during 2002. Talking about the PTCL, he said the privatization
process would be fully transparent and that there was no question
of offering it to any buyer without following the biding process
and meeting the required criteria.

"We have received 11 EOIs for the PTCL and why should we give it to
anyone without following the set criteria," he said, adding that
whoever would offer a bigger price, would get the PTCL.

Mr Saleem said the government was following the decision of the
previous government to transfer the PTCL management to a buyer who
would be interested even in buying its 18pc shares. "But we in the
PC are motivating people, both local and foreigners, to go for 51pc
of the shares of the state enterprises, including the PTCL".

In 1990, he said, PTCL's 12pc shares were disinvested at a value of
Rs55 per share and added that the government had earned $900
million through that. "But now the PTCL share being quoted on the
stock market is just Rs15 per share".

The secretary-general of finance, Moeen afzal, regretted that there
were some misleading reports in newspapers that the PTCL was being
given to a particular foreign group. "There is no question to have
any underhand deal about the PTCL," he assured.

<a name="shcs">SHC sets aside trial court order: Benazir's presence in court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 10: The Sindh High Court set aside an accountability
court's order of personal attendance of former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto in the accountability court for the framing of
modified charges in PIA references against her and others.

The references pertained to alleged illegal appointments, transfers
and postings in PIA and misuse of authority. The accountability
court judge had passed the order while disposing of an application
filed on behalf of Ms Bhutto, praying for recalling the orders of
an AC of June 2, whereby she was told to be present in the court
for alteration of charge.

According to him the procedure of framing charge and alteration of
charge is different, and at the time of alteration, no plea is
required to be recorded. Hence the personal attendance of the
accused at the time of alteration of charge is not necessary. He
also contended that personal attendance of his client had been
dispensed with under Section 205 of CrPC, and the counsel appearing
on her behalf was competent to hear the charge in the absence of
the accused.

The AC judge, while dismissing the recall application, had not
concurred with the counsel for the accused on the above two points,
and had observed that in the present case the attendance of the
accused had been dispensed with by the Supreme Court on May 17,
1999 and charges were read out and explained in her absence by an
Ehtesab Bench on October 20, 1998.

The plea had been recorded but neither the signatures of any person
were available on the plea nor in the plea had it been mentioned as
to who had pleaded on behalf of the accused. Under these
circumstances, the court found necessary that the altered charge be
read out and explained to the accused in person and her plea be
recorded accordingly.

The AC judge also recalled that while dispensing with the personal
attendance of the accused the Supreme Court had authorized the
trial court that at any stage the accused could be told to appear
in person and to take appropriate steps to enforce her attendance.

While praying for setting aside the two orders of the AC, Mr Lakho
contended that the trial judge had erred in considering extraneous
matters such as recording of the statement of the accused under
Section 342 of CrPC while dispensing with the request limited only
to the extent of allowing the accused to be represented by her
counsel at the time of reading out and explaining the amended or
altered charge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 9: A division bench of the Sindh High Court has put
the deputy prosecutor-general of NAB on notice for Friday, on an
application in which the order of the trial court to former prime
minister Benazir Bhutto has been challenged.

Apparently the prosecution had summoned her to modify charges in
the PIA references, pertaining to alleged illegal appointments in
the national airline. Counsel for Ms Bhutto has taken the position
that his client had been exempted by the court from appearing in
court, therefore her presence was not necessary.

The counsel for Ms Bhutto contended that the trial of
accountability reference against his client was pending in the AC-
IV Karachi, which was based on malafide intentions, PPI adds. On
July 11, Judge Muhammad Javed Alam of the AC-IV, dismissing an
application of Ms Bhutto on exemption from appearance in the
proceeding of reference, ordered her to appear in the court on Aug
11, as he would frame charges of the reference on all accused, and
it was necessary to appear before him.

The petitioner's counsel contended that it was not necessary to
appear personally in the proceeding of charge framing. He prayed
the court to exempt Ms Bhutto from appearing in the trial court.
The high court will take up on this matter on Friday.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 10: Mr Zardari was talking to Dawn in Justice
Mansoor Ali Khan's court, where he had been brought under tight
security. He had appeared in the retrial of the ARY gold case.

When asked about former prime minister's return, Mr Zardari did not
rule out the possibility of Ms Bhutto's immediate return if all the
newly-elected councilors, who had won with the PPP support,
appealed to her to return. "Together with the Alliance for
Restoration of Democracy leadership, if these councilors ask her to
come back, she will immediately fly back home", he said.

The former senator said that a time would come when people opposing
military rule would feel the need for a genuine leader, and that
was the time when she would return. "As of today, she is much
better off outside presenting the case of Pakistan's political
parties vis-a-vis the military regime.

"if she comes back at a time when the political situation in the
country is not ripe, the regime will simply put her under house
arrest and throw away the keys. In which case the opposition which
is gathering momentum will also suffer a serious set back", he
maintained.

<a name="nazi">Nazims to be at mercy of provincial governments</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Ismail Khan

PESHAWAR, Aug 6: In a major shift from earlier drafts, the proposed
Local Government Ordinance, 2001 has given more powers to the
provincial governments in terms of checks and balances over the
functioning of district Nazims, leaving them literally at the mercy
of future elected governments.

The proposed ordinance, which is likely to be promulgated by the
governments of Punjab, Sindh, NWFP and Balochistan sometimes this
week ahead of Chief Executive Gen Pervez Musharraf's long- awaited
address to the nation on August 14, represents a major departure
from the earlier draft proposals submitted to the governments for
their views and observations.

A senior government official said the proposed ordinance has been
vetted by the provincial law department and has now been sent to
the Governor NWFP, Lt-Gen (retd) Syed Iftikhar Hussain Shah to seek
approval of his cabinet before promulgating it. No date has been
set as yet for the provincial cabinet meeting but the official
believed it could be held this week.

One of the main objections raised against the earlier draft, and
which has now been addressed in the proposed ordinance, was that it
had given virtually no powers to the provincial chief executives
or, for that matter, the elected provincial assemblies of
overseeing the affairs of district governments.

Section 22 of chapter III provides that the chief executive of the
province may suspend the zila Nazim, if he is satisfied that a
grave emergency exists or is likely to occur which necessitates
immediate removal of the zila Nazim. The suspension of the zila
Nazim shall be subject to ratification by the provincial assembly
within thirty days. Section 3 says that a zila Nazim shall stand
removed from his office if the provincial assembly by a simple
majority of its total membership ratifies his suspension.

The orders of the chief executive of the province, however, will
cease to have effect, if the provincial assembly does not ratify
the suspension of the zila nazim. During the period of suspension
of a zila Nazim, the government shall appoint any other person to
act as zila Nazim as it may deem appropriate till a new zila Nazim
is elected in accordance with the laid-down provision of the
ordinance.

According to section 23 of the proposed ordinance, the chief
executive of the province may move a motion in the Provincial
Assembly stating grounds for the recall (removal) of the zila
Nazim, if in the opinion of the chief executive of the province,
the continuation in office of a zila Nazim is against the public
policy or interest of the people or he is guilty of misconduct. The
zila Nazim shall cease to hold office immediately, if the motion is
approved through a resolution passed by a simple majority of total
membership of the provincial assembly.

As for the internal removal of the zila Nazim, the proposed
ordinance provides a detailed procedure by way of which a member of
a zila Nazim seconded by another member can give notice to move a
motion in the zila council through the Naib Nazim for recall
(removal) of the zila Nazim. If the vote is approved by majority of
the votes of its total membership in the zila council, the election
authority shall cause a vote to be cast by the members of the union
councils in the district whose simple majority in favor of the
motion will remove the zila Nazim from his office.

The proposed ordinance also provides for the setting up of
Provincial Local Government Commission comprising a chairman of the
rank and status of a provincial minister, two 'non-executive'
members from amongst the members of the provincial assembly - one
each from the treasury and the opposition to be nominated by the
speaker of the provincial assembly and two technocrat members
having expertise in economics, law or management. The tenure of the
Provincial Local Government Commission shall be four years.

The commission will conduct annual and special inspections of the
local governments and submit its report to the chief executive of
the province, conduct on its own initiative or so directed by the
chief executive of the province, an inquiry by itself or through
the district government or conduct special audit and resolve
disputes between any department of the government and district
government or between two district governments.

According to chapter XIV, section 3 & 4, the (provincial)
government may provide guidelines, render advice and give
directions to the district government through the zila Nazim
concerned for achieving the ends of the government policy and for
promoting economic, social and environmental security of the
province.

Section 5 of the same chapter provides that where the situation
demands immediate action and the zila Nazim fails to comply with
directions given to him under section 4, the chief executive of the
province may direct the district coordination officer and district
police officer to take such actions as the situation may require.

Where in the opinion of the chief executive of the province, the
zila Nazim is deliberately avoiding or failing to comply with such
directions, the chief executive of the province shall proceed
against the zila Nazim for his suspension.

Apparently, the checks and balances mechanism was introduced in the
proposed ordinance in order to allay apprehensions caused by the
NRB's earlier draft ordinances that would have made the chief
executive of the province and the provincial assembly mere post
offices between the federal and provincial governments.

TORONTO, Aug 6: Dr Tahirul Qadri, president of Pakistan Awami
Tehrik, has claimed that his party's newly-formed alliance with
PML-LM would emerge as a very powerful political group ahead of
next year's general elections in the country.

Talking to newsmen here he said three major political groups are

on a visit to Canada, said besides his party's alliance, religious
parties might get together to put up joint candidates in the
parliamentary elections. Similarly, the PPP, the PML(N) and the
Awami National Party might forge an alliance.

He said there is a great possibility that some other political
parties led by Asghar Khan, Imran Khan and Sardar Farooq Leghari
will join the PAT-PML(LM) alliance. Answering a question he said
that there is also every likelihood that MQM of Altaf Hussain may
join PAT's alliance. Earlier, speaking at a gathering of Pakistani
community members here, he reiterated his resolve to bring about
revolutionary changes in his country.

<a name="data">Data may be used against Pakistan: UN curbs on Taliban</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M. Arshad Sharif

ISLAMABAD, Aug 7: Serious apprehensions exist in the country's
security apparatus about the composition of the United Nations team
of monitors and the high-tech gadgetry that is to be used for
enforcing the arms embargo against the Taliban government.

Officials told Dawn that a Foreign Office official had gone to New
York to brief the UN officials about the security concerns of
Pakistan.

They said the Bush administration was reviewing its policy on
Afghanistan and Pakistan, and the data to be provided by the UN
monitors could be used for imposing sanctions against Pakistan and
for putting it on the list of the terrorist countries.

UN resolutions, co-sponsored by the US and Russia, require the
Taliban to fulfil Washington's demand that Osama bin Laden be
handed over for trial either in the United States or a third
country. The Saudi billionaire faces the charge of masterminding
the 1998 bombings of two US embassies in East Africa.

The US assistant secretary of state for South Asia, Christina B.
Rocca, after her recent visit to India and Pakistan, is on record
having said that Washington wants Osama extradited on terrorism
charges, but added that "Osama is not the be all and the end all.
He is only one problem and he continues to be a threat." Ms Rocca
had further said that the Taliban "continue to harbour terrorists"
and that there can be no "serious progress unless their support for
terrorists stopped."

The move of posting UN monitors is being interpreted in the
official circles as a step to tighten the noose around Osama.
Questioning the legitimacy of posting UN monitors, the director-
general of the Institute of Strategic Studies, Dr Shireen Mazari,
told Dawn that the deployment of the UN monitors in the region was
an indirect way of putting pressure on Pakistan. She suggested that
the UN monitors should carry no arms and their activities should be
closely monitored. Foreign Office officials told Dawn that the
composition of the UN team of monitors was of vital concern to
Pakistan.

<a name="emba">Embassies fail to get response from Kabul</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Syed Talat Hussain

ISLAMABAD, Aug 7: Attempts were in vain by the embassies of the
United States, Australia and Germany to get permission for sending
officials to Kabul to inquire about their nationals in the custody
of the Taliban as no response came from Afghanistan on Tuesday.

Diplomatic sources told Dawn that the American embassy wanted to
send a consular level official, and the Germans and the Australians
were likely to join him provided the permission from Kabul was
granted.

The planned visit is part of the ongoing efforts to seek more
information about the workers of the Shelter Now International, a
non-governmental organization that has been working in Afghanistan
for years. The aid workers, including two American women and four
Germans, were arrested on the charge of spreading Christianity.

They were rounded up by the Taliban's ministry of Promotion of
Virtue and Prevention of Vice in a raid on their offices. Since
then little is known about them, sources said. The Taliban embassy
in Islamabad has not been able to make much headway on getting
information from their headquarters back home. This is an unusual
practice, for in all such incidents when the foreigners get into
trouble their embassies are formally informed about the situation,
the sources said. However, the Taliban have only conveyed through
indirect channels about the condition of these workers.

<a name="want">Benazir wants Rubina's conviction commuted</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring Desk

LONDON, Aug 5: Benazir Bhutto has asked President Pervez Musharraf
to prevent the execution of an illiterate Pakistani woman.
"Compassion is part of Islam's heritage and Pakistan's image can be
enhanced by sparing Rubina Ansari, who is just 24 years old, from
death by hanging," Bhutto was quoted as saying on a PTI website.
Rubina was sentenced to death for murdering a 70-year-old woman in
Sargodha in Pakistan.

If Musharraf does not cut the sentence she will be hanged as early
as tomorrow. She would be the first woman to be executed in
Pakistan for 16 years.

Ms Bhutto said the murder of 70-year-old Hajjan Aziz Begum was a
ghastly crime deserving punishment, but commuting the death
sentence granted to Rubina to life imprisonment will serve the ends
of justice by ensuring a harsh punishment.

Amnesty International stated that Rubina's trial had "appeared to
have fallen short of international standards". Since Pakistan's
independence, eight women were executed by hanging.

<a name="drug">Drugs case against Zardari adjourned</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LAHORE, Aug 7: The Lahore district and sessions judge on Tuesday
fixed Sept 8 for arguments on an application filed by the
prosecution seeking permission for the production of documents
which contain details of the assets which former Senator Asif Ali
Zardari
allegedly acquired by the money earned through drug trafficking.
The documents were recorded by a UK court.

The court is seized of a narcotics case against the former senator.
The case was registered under sections 6, 8, 12, 15 of the Control
of Narcotics Substances Ordinance by the Qila Gujar Singh police on
Oct 19, 1997. The police had initially arrested two persons, Arif
Baloch and Shorang Khan, in another case. The two said they had
worked for Zardari and the alleged statement formed the basis of
the instant case.

The court directed the Kot Lakhpat jail superintendent to get in
touch with the Adiala jail superintendent to ensure Zardari's
presence in the court on the next date of hearing. In case the
order was not implemented, the two superintendents would have to
submit an explanation.

<a name="asif">Asif Sehgal convicted in second case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 4: An accountability court convicted industrialist Asif
Sehgal of willful default on bank loans and sentenced him to seven
years imprisonment. He was also fined Rs10 million. This is his
second conviction.

The court also sentenced his brothers Abid and Arif Sehgal, who did
not join the proceedings, to three years imprisonment for
absconding. Perpetual warrants of arrest were issued for them. The
court directed that the fine be recovered under Section 386 of the
Criminal Procedure Code by way of attachment and sale of convicts'
assets.

In this case, Asif Sehgal was accused of willful default on payment
of Rs16.526 million to Askari Bank Limited. The loan was issued in
the name of Mohib Exports Limited. The complainant said Mohib
Exports Limited was allowed a finance facility in 1993 which after
enhancement amounted to Rs25 million. The facility was secured by
personal guarantee of the three brothers.

The court noted the accused did not deny having availed the
facility and did not dispute the execution of the last agreement
dated Aug 18, 1998, according to which a sum of Rs15 million was
shown as the principal amount. The liability was to be discharged
in February 1999. From August 1998 till the institution of the
complaint, he paid a sum of Rs4.133 million which were adjusted
towards the principal amount.

The court held the defendant's pleas baseless. It said the fact
that the bank had filed a suit for recovery did not absolve the
accused from the criminal liability for willful default. It said
the plea that default by Mohib Group of Industries was caused by
unwise illegal actions on the part of other creditors of the group
was not covered under the relevant provisions of the NAB Ordinance.

The reference was submitted to the court on May 8, 2000. The
charges were framed on Oct 27.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 7: A four-member joint team of International
Monitory Fund and World Bank is due to arrive here on August 14, to
review the report of task force on reform of tax administration.

Sources in the CBR told Dawn on Tuesday that Mr. Richard Highfield
will lead the review mission, which included Graham Holland, Ross
Humpahries, and a representative of the World Bank Michael
Engelshalk.

The team is expected to stay in Islamabad from August 14 to 25,
sources added. During their stay, sources said, the review mission
would go through the report and review the modalities of the
recommendations made by the task fore for restructuring the tax
machinery. Sources said that donor agencies had shown discontent
over the current environment of cumbersome procedures, vast
discretionary powers, poor monitoring and lax supervision couple
with almost zero accountability, which provided a fertile ground
for rampant corruption in the tax machinery.

They said that for generating more revenue the mission was expected
to suggest to the government for streamlining of the existing
process, recommend reduction of exemptions and broadening of tax
base by bringing more people into tax net.

To speed up the revamping of the tax machinery, the newly-appointed
CBR Chairman Riaz Ahmad Malik has already constituted a special
cell - Policy and Tax Reform Cell.

Lahore-Gujranwala section six lane.

According to National Highway Authority (NHA) sources, a high-level
delegation of World Bank headed by Navaid A. Qureshi held talks
with Chairman NHA Maj-Gen Tariq Javed at the head office of the
authority. They discussed in detail matters relating to
rehabilitation of Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar National Highway.

Talking to the delegation Chairman NHA said the government was
giving high priority to the construction and rehabilitation of
highways as highways network play a significant role in the socio-
economic development of the country.

He expressed satisfaction that World Bank had agreed in principle
to provide financial assistance for rehabilitation of 10 sections
of Karachi-Lahore-Peshawar National Highway which also includes
making Lahore-Gujranwala section six lane. He said the whole
project would be completed at an estimated cost of Rs12 billion,
out of which the World Bank had agreed in principle to provide Rs8
billion.

He said the remaining Rs4 billion would be provided by the
government. This amount will be used for development and
rehabilitation of highways and its proper use will be ensured, he
added. He said NHA had adopted a new system of toll collection from
highways in the country under which the amount of toll tax will be
used for construction and maintenance of highways which will help
reduce load on the national exchequer. He expressed hope that this
cooperation would continue in future.-APP

<a name="imff">IMF facility this year: More assistance likely: minister</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 4: Pakistan is likely to get $2 billion to $2.5
billion Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) from the IMF
"within this year" as the United States is encouraging the
International Financial Institutions to help improve the country's
economy.

"The US government is providing an active support to improve our
economy specially by getting for us maximum external resources
through the IFIs," said Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz.

"Their (US) positive aptitude will help us get the PRGF within this
year to alleviate poverty and invigorate growth," he said. Speaking
at a news conference, he said a high-powered IMF mission to be
headed by Mr Clausse Enders would arrive here on August 15 to hold
negotiations on the PRGF as the current $596 million Standby
Arrangement (SBA) would expire on September 30.

Responding to a question, he said he had a very important and
fruitful meeting with US Assistant Secretary of State for South
Asian Affairs, Ms Christina Rocca. He said he was assured by Ms
Rocca that her government was actively considering lifting
sanctions against Pakistan. "I am told that they are actively
reviewing the issue." He said although there were sanctions against
Pakistan, the US government was extending all possible support
specially by abstaining from the Boards meetings of the IMF and the
World Bank to help extend required external assistance to the
country.

He said that Ms Rocca told him that the United States appreciated
Pakistan's reform program and would do every thing possible despite
sanctions. He said that he told Ms Rocca that sanctions could be
counter-productive and that they must be lifted.

Shaukat Aziz expressed hopes that his meeting with Ms Rocca would
also help obtain financial assistance from the US Exim Bank, USAid
and Opec. When asked whether the US official linked the lifting of
sanctions with the restoration of democracy, the minister said:
"She did not raise this issue before me." Shaukat said he could not
say whether she had taken up this issue with other people she met
during her visit.

The finance minister said he had urged the United States during his
meeting with Ms Rocca that Pakistan should be provided a level-
playing field to have an access in US markets. "I told her that
Pakistan should be given duty-free access for its goods in USA like
Bangladesh, Kenya and Jordan," he said, adding that Pakistan
believed in fair market competition. He said Pakistan had made it
abundantly clear that it wanted better trade relations with the
United Nations and was 'not' interested in aid.

The finance minister told reporters that President Musharraf would
announce the initiation of a number of development projects on
August 14, for which he would also travel across the country for
four to five days. "Some of the projects will be physically
launched on Aug 14 while announcement would be made for some other
bigger development projects on that day," he said.

He said Pakistan had lined up huge foreign resources for these
development projects from Saudi Arabia, China, UAE, Oman, Japan and
international donor agencies. He said Saudi Arabia would extend
$250 million soft loan for various projects. The minister said $8
million were being provided by Oman for the construction of runway
at Gwadar, provision for electricity and providing better boats to
the fishermen of the area. He said Saudi Fund for Development was
also considering offering funds for the development of coastal
highways in Balochistan.

"I am leaving for China on Monday to finalize negotiations for a
number of development projects for which Beijing announced
substantial assistance during Chinese prime minister's visit to
Pakistan few months ago," Shaukat Aziz said.

To a question, the minister said that he would discuss with the
Chinese authorities financing for manufacturing/procurement of 69
locomotives, procurement of 29 electric locomotives, Lakhra Coal
Mine project, Saindak copper project and a dryport project.

He said he would meet the Chinese foreign minister, minister for
foreign trade and the finance minister. He said he was hopeful to
have a substantial Chinese funding for various development projects
to be announced on August 14. "I will be back before August 14 with
more details about Chinese financing for our projects."

Answering a question, the finance minister denied that any
particular investor from Lebanon was being sold Pakistan
Telecommunication Company Limited. "We receive foreign investors
every now and then but that does not mean that any special or undue
favor is being offered to anyone," he said.

He said investment climate had improved in Pakistan which was
attracting foreign investors to invest in Pakistan or take part in
the disinvestment process. The whole privatization process would be
transparent, he assured.

He told a reporter that Standby Arrangement (SBA) was not being
extended and it would end on September 30 as per schedule. The
finance minister said the murder of PSO managing director Shaukat
Mirza was very tragic and unfortunate.

<a name="ener">Energy sector faces financial crisis: ADB report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Aug 10: Pakistan's energy sector is facing a financial
crisis which basically stems from weak governance, political
interference in decision-making, poor staff morale, and disregard
of prudential business practices.

According to an ADB report made available to Dawn, the weak
governance and worsening problems in other areas have had a major
impact on the financial performance of the utilities and have
hindered the effectiveness and sustainability of the energy sector.
"Weak governance has resulted in inefficient utility operations,
power theft, reduced billing and collection, and non-payment of
arrears," the report said.

These practices have affected the poor segment of the population
more than the affluent and contributed to the financial crisis in
the sector.

<a name="2bil">$2 billion power investment plan hits snags</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 5: Reluctance on the part of the government to
prepare a model Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) has become a major
bottleneck in the $2 billion investment plan by a Swedish company
to set up a wind-powered electricity generation project, Dawn
reliably learnt.

Interestingly, the WAPDA Chairman, Lt-Gen Zulfiqar Ali Khan, has
already issued a letter of intent to Milergo AB of Sweden and M/s
Golden Valley Company for setting up two wind energy stations to
produce 20MW of electricity, a source said.

The WAPDA chairman, after a detailed presentation by the
representatives of the Swedish company on the benefits of wind-
propelled power generation, was so impressed that he went out of
his way and issued an LOI, knowing full well that it was the
prerogative of the federal government to allow any company to
undertake a project.

In the LOI, WAPDA permitted the Swedish company to immediately
undertake a feasibility study of wind energy generation in
Pakistan. The company, through the LOI, was given an assurance that
WAPDA and the KESC would extend all possible assistance to the
sponsors in securing the various consents, approvals and permits
from the government of Pakistan, respective provincial government
and local authorities for the smooth execution of the project.

Bureaucratic rigmarole at the Ministry of Water and Power and
Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) have become a
stumbling block in the way of $2 billion investment in the country,
he added.

<a name="merg">Merger, winding up of financial institutions on cards</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Aug 7: The government has decided to reduce the number
of Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) from 17 to 3 only,
through their mergers and, in some cases, by altogether disbanding
them.

Official sources said that poor performance of most of the DFIs has
forced the authorities to either disband them or manage their
mergers, preferably before the end of 2001. They said that the best
way to save the financial sector from political interference was to
privatise all the National Commercial Banks (NCBs) and to reduce
the number of DFIs from 17 to 3.

The World Bank was expected to extend $250 million loan for
restructuring the NCBs and the DFIs. The restructuring plan of the
NCBs seeks to achieve a cost/income ratio of 0.65 per cent through
staff reduction (40 per cent), branch closure, and outsourcing of
non-core activities.

The plan envisages privatization of two NCBs (Habib Bank and United
Bank) within the tenure of the present government and to prepare a
third bank (NBP) for the purpose. Because of the distressed
conditions of these banks (high-cost structures and depleted
balance sheets), potential buyers have indicated they are not
interested in taking over banks in their present conditions.

The government is, therefore, seeking Word Bank's support during
2001 to finance the cost of banks restructuring to improve their
prospects for sell-off. According to a latest World Bank report,
NCBs stemmed operating losses through staff reductions (30 per
cent) and closure of 500 loss-making branches. A third of the stock
of loan defaults was recovered by the end of 1999.

The current government, says the report, has supplemented loan
recovery through the establishment of a government agency - the
Corporate and Industrial Restructuring Corporation (CIRC) - which
was in the process of assuming the NCBs' and DFIs' all private
sector non-performing loans of amounts above Rs10 million and which
already have court orders for recovery.

The WB believed that disclosure standards, banking regulations and
supervision were also strengthened through a major independent
central bank; improved corporate governance through the
introduction of private sector boards and management in state-owned
banks; and reduced intermediation costs. These measures helped the
banking system improve capital adequacy, asset quality, efficiency
and profitability. "However, as the banking crisis eased and
financial institutions began to heal, the reform process slowed
down," the report noted.

In May 1999, political interference resumed through new centrally-
mandated credit programs; loan recovery weakened; and bank
privatization stalled. However, the work to strengthen the central
bank's regulatory capacity did continue with good results. Despite
some setbacks, the WB continued, through its policy dialogue and
technical assistance to the central bank, to encourage the
government to deepen the banking reforms. At the request of the
present government, a financial sector update was completed in May
2000. It laid the basis for the government's banking sector reform
program.

<a name="ifcb">IFC backs out of $260m pledge: Funds for 23 cos</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihatshamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Aug 6: The International Finance Corporation (IFC) has
cancelled $260 million funds it has committed to 23 private
companies in Pakistan. According to World Bank's latest report on
Pakistan Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), the IFC's ability to do
business in Pakistan has been constrained.

The 1998 balance of payment crisis, the large external
indebtedness, political instability, dispute with investors
(specially in the power sector), and the loss of investors
confidence have increased the perceived risk and discouraged new
investment. Moreover distortionary policies - for cement,
automotive, oil and gas for example - further deter private
investment and handicap IFC's support.

"The IFC, which is a subsidiary of the World Bank, has therefore
focussed on restructuring its own portfolio, while helping existing
clients restructure and strengthen their companies' balance sheet.
This had led to the cancellation of some 260 million dollar in
commitments to 23 companies. As a result now Pakistan ranks as IFCs
8th largest exposure, down from 6th in December 1998," the report
said. IFC's disbursed own account portfolio is currently 447
million dollar in 45 companies of which 38 per cent is in five
Independent Power Producer (IPP) projects. All the IPPs are now
operational. The IFC's B Loan portfolio is currently 254 million
dollar in 13 companies, with a strong concentration (57 per cent)
in power. Of the 45 portfolio companies, 9 are not current, 64
million dollar are overdue and in non-accrual, while reserves for
loan losses are 80 million dollars.

IFC recently committed a 100 million dollar Trade Enhancement
Facility, which will make available additional resources for
confirmation of imports of letter of credits. This would be of
particular help to smaller companies. IFC, according to the report,
is considering further investments in the financial sector, and in
the gas sector, where foreign investment is needed to help the
development of proven gas reserves. "However, the pace of further
IFC investment will depend on continued progress towards economic
and political stability, a more transparent, non-discretionary and
market-based policy environment, and privatization of banks and
other public enterprises," the report said.

Subject to such progress, priorities for future IFC investment are
to develop the financial sector to improve access to finance by
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and micro enterprises, and
improve the efficiency of commercial banking; investments in gas
production and transportation; support for private investment in
infrastructure; and investments in industries with strong
prospects, which can be competitive without dependence on
government protection or subsidies.

The report also said that with approximately 111 million dollar in
Political Risk Insurance (PRI) cover, Pakistan is
MIGA's(Multilateral Investment Guarantee Authority) tenth largest
country in terms of net exposure. The portfolio covers investment
in the financial infrastructure (including three IPPs) and
manufacturing sectors. MIGA's activities in Pakistan have also been
hampered by Pakistan's poor investment climate.

"Nonetheless, while foreign investors have adopted a wait-and-see
attitude towards Pakistan, interest in MIGA guarantees in the
country remains strong, as evidenced by numerous inquiries,
received by the agency in various sector, including financial,
agricultural, construction and oil and gas," the Bank's report
said.

<a name="inst">Institutional traders shunt bears out of market</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Muhammad Aslam

The KSE 100-share index after hitting the week's low at 1,229.00
showed smart recovery as most of the leading base shares rose and
finished with a modest rise of 10.45 points at 1,252.29 as compared
to 1,242.84 points a week earlier.

The total market capitalization also rose to Rs316 billion from the
previous low of Rs314.00 billion as the heavily-capitalized shares,
notably the PTCL and the Hub-Power recovered.

The important KSE decisions include, among others", the cash
deposit waiver on share business up to Rs50 million, the cut in
share transaction fee and the extension of the settlement period
for futures contract to one month from the current 15 days.

Although, the board meeting did not take up the issue of T+3
trading system, and its negative impact on the daily-traded volumes
could be taken at an appropriate time after giving it fair chance.

After touching the year's low level of 1,229 points, the KSE 100-
share index did recover and finished above the support level at
1,252.00, no one was sure how it would behave in the very next
session despite the revival of the strong covering-purchases by
institutions in the PTCL.

The selective buying in some of the leading base shares, notably
the Hub-Power and the PTCL could put the market back on the rails,
if it is sustained for another couple of sessions at the current
lower levels.

The dividend announcements at the rate of 50 per cent; 11 per cent
and an interim bonus shares of 30 per cent by Arif Habib
Securities, the BSJS Balanced Fund and Jahangir Siddiqi Investment
Bank were in line with the market expectations but failed to
generate fresh buying in their shares. An interim dividend of 3.5
per cent by the KASB Premier Fund was also well-received.

According to the sources, the floating stock of Rs5bn to 6bn is in
the market, which is keeping the sentiment bearish. Although minus
and plus signs equally matched, some leading shares managed to post
fresh gains under the lead of Clariant Pakistan, Haroon Oils,
Mitchell's Fruits, Knoll Pharmaceuticals on the reports of higher
profit for the half year ended June 30,2001.The losers were led by
Millat Tractors, Gul Ahmed Textiles, Adamjee Insurance followed by
Arif Habib Securities, International Investment Financials, Alico,
Nimir Resins, the Attock Refinery, Pakistan Oilfields, National
Refinery, Bolan Casting and several others but the losses were
fractional.

The trading volume did not expand despite the late week's active
short-coverings in the PTCL totalled 303m shares. Other actively

<a name="seed">Seed corporation's sale on donors' agenda</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Amjad Mahmood

LAHORE, Aug 7: After the provincial food departments, the Punjab
Seed Corporation is the next target of the world donor agencies
insisting on the introduction of open market forces in the
agriculture sector of the country, it is learnt.

Various multinational companies operating in the seed business are
exerting their pressure on the government through the donor
agencies for the privatization of the PSC, the Asia's largest seed
supplying company. Sources say that the step will be taken in the
name of projecting the local private sector in the trade though the
local firms have no required scientific system and experience for
seed research, multiplication, processing, storage and quality
control.

There are over 380 registered private concerns active in the field.
They fear that after the disbandment of the public sector
institution, the local farmers will be left at the mercy of the
multinationals which are already fleecing them in the sale of
pesticides.

This step coupled with deregulation of the irrigation sector will
leave no room for the farming community to face the challenge of
the WTO regime, they add. The PSC, established in 1976, is the only
public sector institution which is providing certified seeds to
farmers of all the four provinces without getting any financial aid
from the government.

It is also earning foreign exchange through the export of seeds by
the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN, and is also
meeting the seed requirements of the World Food Programme. Sources
in the corporation say that the PSC is also supplying quality seeds
to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Iran and Afghanistan.

They say India had tried to capture the Asian market through cheap
supplies but failed as its seeds could not give the projected yield
in Bangladesh. The private concerns are marketing cotton seed of
various quality at rates ranging from Rs10,000 to Rs40,000 per bag
in the local market, while the PSC is supplying international
standard seed at Rs8,000 per bag.

Kissan Board President Sadiq Khakwani has at a forum stressed the
need for strengthening the PSC instead of privatizing it in the
larger interest of the farming community. He says the presence of
the corporation is necessary to save the farmers from fleecing by
the multinationals and hoarding by the local private firms.

<a name="twow">Two wrongs can make a right</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

On August 11, 1947, Mohammad Ali Jinnah spoke to the members of his
country's first Constituent Assembly. His first observation: "You
will no doubt agree with me that the first duty of a government is
to maintain law and order so that the life, property and religious
beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the state."

Fifty-four years later this 'duty' remains unfulfilled. Citizens of
this country are gunned down in the streets merely because of their
religious beliefs. Most properties are unprotected by the law and
its agents.

There actually is no law, no order. And now, yet again, since the
writ of the law cannot be effectively implemented, the government
of the province of Sindh has decided to change the law in much the
same way as is done in the kingdom of Id. Says the King to his
people: "Your beloved King has eliminated crime in city parks."
"How?" ask the people. "I have legalized mugging," explains the
king.

In Karachi, the King of Sindh tells us: "The 260-odd buildings,
illegally and unlawfully constructed, cannot be regularized under
the present law. So, we will change the law."

In my column last Sunday I wrote about the building mafia and how
it has managed to 'persuade' the Sindh government into believing
that if the illegally constructed buildings are legalized the
building industry in Karachi will be revived. How? one may ask.

A recent survey has it that there are at present approximately
100,000 flats built by speculators which are lying vacant awaiting
buyers, and that there are approximately 200,000 plots of all sizes
and shapes which have been bought but not yet built upon.

On July 24, the Sindh cabinet in its finite wisdom decided to
promulgate an ordinance "To further amend the Sindh Building
Control Ordinance, 1979." The ordinance reads:

Now therefore, in exercise of the powers conferred by clause (1) of
Article 8 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,
the Governor of Sindh is pleased to make and promulgate the
following ordinance:

(i) This Ordinance may be called the Sindh Buildings Control
Ordinance, 2001. (ii) It shall come into force at once. Sub-section
(1-A) of Section 19 [SBCO 1979] is hereby substituted with the
following amendments for a period of twelve (12) months commencing
from the date of promulgation of this Ordinance.

'The Authority or any person authorized by it in this behalf may
compound any offence under this ordinance, including change of land
use on deposit of prescribed composition fee ranging from 200 per
cent to 300 per cent of the existing rate of composition and other
necessary fees as approved by the Authority, depending upon the
socio-economic conditions of different localities, on production of
a certificate of structural stability duly verified by a Licensed
Structural Engineer, on such terms and conditions as prescribed,
except the buildings which have environmentally degrading
activities such as manufacturing, storage of dangerous/inflammable
materials, or caters to the service sector to transport, conversion
of parking spaces to other uses until such spaces are restored to
their original function, the reservation of road widening scheme
and violation of property line or any hazardous use.'

Proviso of sub-section (1-A) of Section 19 of SBCO 1979 is hereby
substituted with [the] following new proviso:

'Provided that building works carried out in violation of Karachi
Building and Town Planning Regulations and rules framed thereunder
in respect of foot print, compulsory open space, excess covered
area and projection of the building shall be compounded subject to
realization of composition fee enhanced by 400 per cent from
existing rate of composition and other necessary fees as approved
by the Authority if the deviation does not exceed beyond 20 per
cent of the permissible limit on the terms and conditions as
prescribed by the Authority.'

This last paragraph of the ordnance in effect permits rules to be
broken purposefully and with impunity to the extent of 20 percent.
Senseless?

This was followed by a letter dated July 28 addressed to those
concerned (e.g., me as member of the KDA governing body and a
member of the KBCA oversee committee) by Brigadier Zafar Ahmed
Malik, an honest but misguided retired army officer who is the
present Chief Controller of Buildings of the Karachi Building
Control Authority, which informed us, inter alia:

The presentation on regularization of buildings was given to the
President of Pakistan on 2/6/2001 and thereafter on the
instructions of the Honourable Governor of Sindh the draft
notification for regularization was forwarded to the government on
15/6/2001.

A presentation on the subject was given to the cabinet and Governor
Sindh on 24/7/2001. I am glad to inform you that the cabinet
approved the proposal...

In this respect there are certain apprehensions which I would like
to clarify that every building will be regularized. Cabinet has
fixed certain parameters for regularization which will be strictly
adhered to. Buildings which are structurally unsound or lacking
adequate facilities for safety of the occupant will not be
regularized. Citizen safety is of paramount importance.

With the decision of the cabinet a long outstanding issue has been
resolved. Before the cabinet decision the subject was deliberated
at length at various forums for a considerable period. People were
demanding it for a long time. [What sort of people? The intentional
law breakers? Not a single written request is on the brigadier's
files.] Majority were of the view that the problems should be
resolved as per recommendation of the committee. We welcome the
government decision and hope this will help in reviving the
building industry. [How?] KBCA will make every effort to make the
process as transparent as possible [Apart from the brigadier, most
of the KBCA men are corrupt]. KBCA will publicize the matter
through media TV/newspapers and also by holding public
seminars/workshops for the awareness of the general public. The
approval will be granted after due scrutiny and verification of
stability of structure on payment of composition fee as approved by
the cabinet.

This badly drafted ordnance will win the approbation of the vocal
minority - five hundred illegal builders and a couple of hundred
people who have invested in flats and shops. The silent majority -
the millions of citizens of Karachi - have been safely ignored. It
will be a long time before anyone realizes that the penalties being
paid by the mafias who have broken the law is peanuts compared to
the penalties being paid by the honest citizens of this unhappy
metropolis who will have to live with the consequences of the
'regularization'.

For a small 'regularization' fee, anyone living in Karachi can have
his residential house legally converted into a shopping mall, or a
school, or an office, or a beauty salon, or a pakora parlour. Even
if not required to be used as such today, the message is: convert
it now while the going is good as an investment for the future. One
does not have to worry about the restrictive covenants of the plot
lease obtained from the KMC, or BOR, or KDA, or a cooperative
society. 'Regularization' will override all other laws, contracts,
leases, agreements, articles, and understandings.

In 1985, at a cost of $ 40 million, a master plan was made for the
city of Karachi, but it was apparently never notified or legalized.
The program now is to borrow again, almost half of this amount from
the World Bank and update the old plan. Why waste money? Why
increase the debt of the citizens of this country? The
'regularization', ipso facto, makes the builders' mafia the new
town planners. In its wisdom, the mafia will decide, within
existing schemes such as Clifton, PECHS, Nazimabad, Garden East,
etc, where urban renewal is to be carried out, which houses are to
be changed into flat sites, which amenity spaces are to be
converted into commercial plazas, how much open space is required
within plots, how many floors are to be allowed, how the traffic
will flow, on which public streets children will play cricket, and
on which public streets they will play football.

Just take the case of a building on Sharea Faisal. The builder has
constructed 250,000 square feet of excess unauthorized office
space. How? By purposefully breaking the law? Or was it an
oversight?

This builder breaker-of-the-law is now jumping with joy. He will,
with the greatest delight, cough up Rs 300 per square foot as
'regularization' penalties, which will total Rs 75 million, an
amount which to him is negligible.

A selling price of Rs 2,000 per square foot will leave him with a
clear illicit profit of Rs 1,200 per square foot, which for the
entire illegal 250,000 square feet totes up to a neat profit of Rs
300 million.

However, help is at hand. The governor of Sindh, the chairman of
the Economic Development Council, is busy 'devolutionizing'. The
vice-chairman of the EDC, the well-meaning Shahid Feroz whose
imagination soars in the direction of grandiose visions, has been
made aware that the ordinance, as drafted, is faulty in the
extreme. He has promised to take up the matter with his chairman.
To quote Shahid: " The draft ordnance needs to be refined ."

<a name="thel">The last of the cold warriors</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

There may be many Delhis that historians or other specialists would
know of but as I make the Lahore-Delhi run for the second time in
less than a month there are two I am getting familiar with.

One is the happening city, a fizz in its air, which leaves many
Pakistanis a bit green with envy. Why can't their cities be like
this? The other is Fortress Delhi, a holdover from the cold war,
where the old shibboleths still cast their spell.

In so many areas India is fast moving ahead. It does not take long
for a visitor from Pakistan to notice the difference between the
cosmopolitanism of Delhi and the provincialism of even our larger
cities. Lahore, once the pride of this part of the world, now has
the mindset (psychology, system of values) that would fit a
village.

Who were the two choices for Lahore district head or nazim in the
just-concluded local election? Hafiz Salman Butt and Mian Aamir
Mahmood, both of whom would not look out of place in a movie about
toughs and underworld heavies.

Between the MQM and a succession of weak and bungling provincial
overlords we have tried our best to pull down Karachi. If it still
retains aspects of its commercial glory, it is no thanks to its
godfathers but purely because of its own resilience.

Islamabad is neither here nor there, its pretensions and pomposity
being a heavy burden on the land.

So Delhi then is cosmopolitan. More happens here on a crowded
evening than in Islamabad for an entire year. All the more
astonishing then that Fortress Delhi, the counterpoint to all this
openness, still retains the flavour of the Berlin Wall.

In this Fortress there is no window more tightly shuttered against
the elements than the one which opens on Pakistan. Miss Haversham's
world with its cobwebs and a clock which has forgotten to tick.
Behind the barred window this is the room from where time has been
evacuated.

Media people in India are easy to deal with. Finding a common
wavelength with them is not difficult. When they indulge in self-
criticism a Pakistani is encouraged to admit to the reigning
follies on his side of the divide.

A genuine conversation starts in which the participants talk to
each other instead of at each other which has been the standard
procedure in Indo-Pak face-offs.

Sure, the media world has its fiery priests but in the English
language part of it such fundamentalists are few in number - those
who think diplomacy best functions when only one side, that sitting
across the table, makes the concessions. The majority do not belong
to this narrow church. If they did, Pakistani wordsmiths would not
have been allowed to have their say on Indian TV.

But the kitchen in Fortress Delhi is not in the hands of any
doubting Thomases; people inclined to question established
verities. It is in the firm control of a breed vanishing elsewhere
but alive and well in this part of the world: cold warriors to the
last man and fighting woman. To see them in play or action is a
humbling experience. It is enough to turn the most peaceable dove
into a wild-eyed hawk.

For these clerics of the rigid line the memory of Agra rankles. Not
so much for what it failed to achieve but for what it gave the
Pakistanis: a credible media victory on Indian soil. General
Musharraf's performance at his famous breakfast meeting with Indian
editors has not been forgiven. It continues to be painted in
various colours of treachery and betrayal as if the televizing of
it by Star News was a dark plot on the part of the spin doctors who
formed part of the Pakistani delegation.

But wherein lay the mischief? Not in the act of televizing but in
the fact that Musharraf came out of it looking articulate and
masterful. It is this success which rankles and this which has not
been forgiven. If Musharraf had been savaged by the editors, had he
been mopping his brow under their questioning or come out of the
encounter bruised and bleeding, and if the whole thing had then
been shown on television, Musharraf would have been commiserated
with and given lectures on the values of a free society.

Since it turned out otherwise, the cold warriors who act as pilots
on Kashmir and Pakistan are finding it difficult to keep their
indignation in check. In an encounter in which the Pakistani side
appeared lighter-footed than its Indian counterpart their one
consolation has come in the form of the summit's eventual failure.
If a joint declaration incorporating the Pakistani position on
Kashmir had been signed their world would have crumbled.

It is important to get the context of the summit right. The
invitation to General Musharraf was offered from a height, as an
act of condescension from an India basking in the warm glow of its
perceived superiority. It was not part of the script that someone
not long ago reviled as a dictator and mastermind of "cross-border
terrorism" should in any way turn the tables on his hosts. But when
this is what started happening, the discomfort on the Indian side
became palpable.

What had been showcased as a symbol of Indian reasonableness - the
invitation to Musharraf - was turning into a public relations
nightmare. It was not the televizing of the breakfast meeting which
thwarted the signing of a declaration but the gathering Indian
realization that Pakistan was getting away with too much.

This is not to say that masters of trench warfare exist only on the
Indian side. They have their happy counterparts in Pakistan as
well, liberators of Kashmir who would willingly fight to the last
Kashmiri.

The generals and diplomats of this hard school are interchangeable.
Their briefs may be different but the attitude which informs them
is to a striking degree the same. Between them there will be no
solution of the Kashmir problem. Not now and not in the next fifty
years.

But it's amazing how some people in Pakistan fall prey to the most
absurd illusions. There are no Kashmir solutions being studied in
Fortress Delhi. Academics and other people on the fringes of power
may occasionally toy with different theories.

But they don't matter. The keys to the drawbridge are not in their
hands. Those who have the keys operate from fixed positions, none
of which allows any flexibility on Kashmir or nothing that even
remotely calls into question the sacrosanctity of existing
frontiers. The subcontinent is a cruel place for such luxuries as
the flowering of hope.

But is there any alternative to talking? At the risk of appearing
to wear my patriotism on my sleeve, I think Pakistan has handled
matters with India in a mature manner since Agra. For instance, it
has mercifully chosen not to respond to MrVajpayee's
uncharacteristic outburst against Gen Musharraf for knowing neither
history nor the rules of international diplomacy. India has been
embarrassed by these remarks and not Pakistan. To have shown
umbrage at them would have been a lapse of judgment.

Agra was a good thing because it played before a wide audience. Far
from being blamed for this outcome, the media deserves praise for
lending excitement to what otherwise would have been a bleak and
sterile affair.

People in both countries haven't suffered for being made aware of
each other's viewpoint.

In the long line of Indo-Pak summits which stick in the mind? To
some extent Tashkent. Certainly Simla. The rest are a blur. Agra
will be remembered for the excitement it brought even though,
unlike Tashkent and Simla, the firing of no guns preceded it. For a
change India and Pakistan should learn to get excited about peace
if at all they are to move out of their loveless embrace.

I have written the above lines in New Delhi. In Pakistan I probably
would not have written on this subject because I know that most
people are sick and tired of Agra. They are also aware that going
on and on about the General's performance there can only be
calculated to inflate his head and lead to further extensions in
his presidential term. But I was invited to Delhi for a panel
discussion on the Agra breakfast meeting - the ethics of it and so
on - and have put down the impressions that I gathered after
listening to some eminent cold warriors.

<a name="goin">Going to the dogs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

Ever since opinionated people began recording their views, every
generation has expounded at length on how things are going to the
dogs.

In most cases, this is just a case of calcified minds unable to
come to terms with a changing world. But in Pakistan, there is
clearly some justification for this refrain, and when we talk about
a continuous deterioration, we can actually quantify it. On my
recent trip (too soon over, alas), I traveled to England, Canada,
the United States and Turkey, and in each country, solicitous
friends asked in hushed tones how Pakistan was doing, almost as
though they were asking about the health of a terminally ill
relative on a life support system.

Although I knew these well-meaning people were genuinely concerned,
I must confess to a flash of irritation whenever I faced this
question. And while I replied glibly that the patient was limping
along in the fashion of many Third World nations, I knew in my
heart that things were far worse than I implied. In most countries
similarly placed half a century ago, there has been significant
progress with very few exceptions. Indeed, it will be difficult for
the younger generation to believe that Pakistan was often cited as
a model developing state.

To this day, many old PIA hands will tell you that the Pakistani
flag-carrier had played a crucial role in setting up Emirates
Airlines. They do not often reflect on the irony of the fact that
Emirates is today one of the best airlines in the world, while PIA
is among the very worst. In many ways this reversal in fortune
parallels the trajectory Pakistan has followed.

A couple of months ago, the Pakistan Institute of Labor, Education
and Research (PILER) organized a seminar on PIA, and it was
interesting to note that the airline management largely blamed the
"Open Sky" policy that opened up the country's airports to foreign
competition for their present woes. I pointed out that this policy
had made life a lot easier for the traveling public as competition
had forced airlines to lower fares, and that it is not the function
of the state to support an inefficient organization at the cost of
its citizens.

However, one factor that was rightly highlighted was the absurd
practice of making the defence secretary in Islamabad the chairman
of the airline while the managing-director in the PIA head office
in Karachi had very limited powers. Also the MD was changed as
often as the Pakistan cricket team's captain. In both cases, such
short tenures are a formula for failure. Management also cited low
labor productivity as a major factor contributing to its decline.
For instance, a certain check on the Airbus took other airlines 11
days, while PIA engineering staff took over 35 days. In their turn,
the unions blamed the management for PIA's flawed policies, and
said, while union activity had been banned, senior managers were
not held accountable. Given the tension between the management and
the workers as well the low morale, it is doubtful if this once-
proud organization can pull out of its slump. With accumulated
losses of over 11 billion rupees, the airline has been
haemorrhaging red ink over its balance sheet for years.

Pakistan Railways is another national institution that has been run
into the ground. An efficient and profitable outfit until the
sixties, its slow but steady decline began when the government
began starving it of resources and shifting its attention to road
transport. It is currently creaking along, incurring huge losses
every year. Hardly any train now arrives on time, and journeys in
its once comfortable coaches is a torture.

Other public sector departments such as health, education and
engineering are in similar free-fall. While our engineers worked
with distinction on construction projects abroad until a few years
ago, now we have to import these skills if we want decent roads or
bridges. Water mains and sewage lines are a mess our engineering
staff wisely leaves well alone. WAPDA and KESC are kept afloat
through massive subsidies.

The performance of all these organizations is measurable by that
most pitiless of all yardsticks: the bottom line of their balance
sheet. Or since physical and social infrastructure departments
prepare no profit and loss accounts, their output can be gauged by
the state of public education, health and roads. Granted there is a
uniform shortage of resources that affects efficiency, it can
hardly be said that in its infancy. Pakistan was rolling in money.
The sad fact is that this sharp decline in standards has been
caused more by mediocrity and demoralization than lack of funds.

Friends as well as many readers over the years have complained that
I always dwell on the negative aspects of life in Pakistan while
failing to highlight any positive developments. While admitting to
a certain innate pessimism. I must say in my defence that as I have
watched the decline and deterioration of much that was good in this
country, I find that I am honestly unable to balance this with
whatever has been achieved.

Currently I am involved with running an ambitious private sector
educational institution, and my colleagues and I are evaluating
applications for new admissions. I must say that every year we are
appalled by the falling standards of those passing the intermediate
examination and seeking a professional education. Probably the
worst of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's many disastrous policies was his
government's nationalization of private schools and colleges. After
nearly three decades, several generations of boys and girls have
suffered the consequences, and now enter adulthood ill-equipped to
compete. This single factor is responsible for many of Pakistan's
woes as products of an increasingly ramshackle educational system
assume positions of responsibility.

According to received wisdom, our social indicators are poor
because the government does not spend enough on this sector.
However, given the chronic leakage of resources, the quality of
manpower and the low level of motivation of the staff manning state
institutions in these areas, I doubt that there would be much
improvement if we were to even double the budgets of these
departments. Indeed, this is true of virtually every public sector
institution.

This is a frightening prospect. All along, we had assumed that our
under-development was caused by a paucity of resources, and if we
could somehow curtail our defence expenditure, things would improve
overnight. But if in truth our backwardness is the result of deeper
causes, we have to look elsewhere for answers.

<a name="iccp">ICC probe Wasim and Inzamam</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring Desk

LONDON, Aug 10: Inzamam-ul-Haq, Wasim Akram and Brian Lara are
among the cricketers being investigated by the International
Cricket Council's anti-corruption unit. "We are still working on
other cases that at present are not in the public domain,"
confirmed the head of the unit, Lord Paul Condon.

Lord Condon did not name names but Telegraph Sport understands that
these three cricketers are among the ones he was referring to. As
already revealed by Telegraph Sport on July 3, there have been
suspicions for some time regarding Inzamam. They center round his
performance against Australia in the one-day match at Cardiff on
June 9.

In the match Inzamam was out second ball, stumped by Adam Gilchrist
off Shane Warne for a duck. Simon Briggs, reporting the match,
which Pakistan lost, for Telegraph Sport, wrote that Inzamam
appeared to react to the stationing of a silly point by "sallying
pointlessly down the pitch".

The suspicion is that Inzamam's sally may have been anything but
pointless and investigators are looking into whether it could have
been part of some spread-betting operation. Inzamam has not so far
been questioned by the unit, and if he is this would not be the
first time he has figured in cricket corruption inquires. Judge
Malik Mohammed Qayyum questioned him during his inquiry into
alleged Pakistani match-fixing, the judge eventually censuring his
behaviour and fining him.

Lara, meanwhile, is now being investigated by Elliott Mottley, the
Barbadian QC, as part of the West Indian board investigation into
alleged match-fixing. Lara, like Wasim, has always denied any
match-fixing and vehemently rejected claims by the Indian
bookmaker, Mukesh Gupta, that he was paid $40,000 to under perform
in two one-day games.

<a name="edge">Pakistan edge out India in thriller</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 5: Asian giants Pakistan edged old rivals India
4-3 in a tense and dramatic match to grab full points in the Sultan
Azlan Shah Cup.

Pakistan raced to a 2-0 lead after just 27 minutes only for India
to draw level before the break.

Kashif Jawwad deflected a cross from Muhammad Nadeem in the 18th
minute while Muhammad Sabbir made it 2-0 nine minutes later.

India pulled one back in the 28th minute when Daljeet Singh
Dhillion converted their first penalty corner of the match while
Deepak Thakur scored a filed goal for the equalizer.

Undeterred by the setback, Pakistan continued their attack in the
second half. They needed just a minute of the second half to go
back in front. Once again it was the Nadeem-Kashif combination
which brought the goal, with Kashif deflecting another cross from
Nadeem past the Indian keeper.

Play swung from end to end with both sides having chances to change
the score line. But it took India until the 53rd minute to equalize
when 18-year-old Jugraj Singh's crisp shot from a penalty corner
flew into goal.

Just as it looked like India would escape with a point, Sohail
Abbas scored the winner 10 minutes from time with a brilliantly
executed flick from Pakistan's second penalty corner of the match.

Speaking after the game, Indian assistant coach Raipudaman Singh:
"The boys played above themselves today. The result did not matter
as what is important is the players' performances. "Some teams
would have to win and some lose so, I'm not disappointed. It was an
exciting match and the difference was that Pakistan had Sohail
Abbas in their side."

Pakistan manager Brig Khalid Sajjad Khokhar: "Our game plan was to
score an early goal - which we did by scoring twice.
"Unfortunately, we made the mistake of playing an attacking game
even after we led by two goals and this allowed the Indians to come
back and force a draw." Meanwhile, England held Commonwealth Games
champions Australia to a 1-1 draw.

<a name="shoa">Shoaib's attitude no problem</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 6: The manager of the Pakistan cricket team Yawar
Saeed said the youngsters would not be affected by the humiliating
exit of some of the senior players for the training camp which
began at the National Stadium.

He also dispelled impressions that `bad boy' Shoaib Akhtar's
negative attitude had polluted the dressing room atmosphere and
team's morale. "I don't think the youngsters will be mentally
affected by the absence of senior players. I haven't discussed this
issue with them nor I intend to because it is not their concern,"
Yawar told reporters.

Wasim Akram, who began his glittering career when some of the camp
attendees might have been toddlers, and Moin Khan were dumped by
the selectors for a reconditioning camp for the forthcoming season
during which Pakistan will play 12 Tests and 20 odd one-day
internationals.

Yawar refused to agree to the logic that situation of uncertainty
must be prevailing in the Pakistan camp in the background of Wasim
and Moin's controversial ousters.

Yawar desperately tried to cover up the follies of the selectors
when he said players not invited for the camp would get chance to
impress the selectors in practice matches. He said the decision had
been taken by the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Lt
Gen Tauqir Zia.

"I make one thing very clear. It is not necessary that the squad
for the season opening Test will be composed from the 27 probables
invited for the camp. Any players performing in practice games will
stand a good chance to earn a recall," Yawar said. He said the camp
rejectees would form a squad which would test the abilities of the
squad comprising camp trainees. He said the matches will be played
on Aug 14 and 20 under lights.

"Although I am not part of the selection committee, in fact I am
not in any decision-making committee, but I do air my views,
observations and recommendations. "I would not comment on the
exclusion of Wasim Akram but there can't be no two opinions that he
is one of the greatest. I was a selector when he first appeared on
the scene, then I was the manager of the team in which Wasim first
went as a player. I have seen the graph of Wasim's performance
reach sky-high," he said.

Yawar said during the tour of England, Wasim was a role model for
the youngsters. Ironically, Faqir Aizazuddin, who went as manager
on the tour to New Zealand, had claimed in his report that Wasim
was a negative influence over the players. On Shoaib Akhtar, who
has become a permanent liability on the PCB, Yawar said he was not
a bad influence on the team.

"Everybody has an attitude, positive or negative. But I confirm
that his attitude is not affecting the team," Yawar summed up
Shoaib's approach in a diplomatic manner.

The manager said he or the captain would have no objection to
Shoaib's inclusion if he was fit. "A fit Shoaib is an asset." Yawar
said he has been conveyed by the establishment that a coach would
be appointed during the camp. He, nevertheless, said that the
concept that coach would change everything was wrong. "I believe
its the captain who is the coach in the field. It's the captain who
has to get the best out of his boys." Yawar said the basic
objective of the training camp would be the make the players
mentally and physically stronger.

<a name="waqa">Waqar's threat irks officials</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 8: Waqar Younis' outburst and threat has upset the
administrators. According to highly placed sources, the top
hierarchy of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) contacted manager
Yawar Saeed and Waqar Younis to inquire about their point of views.

Waqar threatened Tuesday that he would quit if the selectors didn't
give due consideration to his point of view in selection of the
squads. The sources couldn't confirm if a show cause notice would
be served to the Pakistan captain. But he added that if any
disciplinary action was taken, it would be confined to four walls
and under the roof.

"The PCB is determined to maintain the sanctity and dignity of the
Pakistan cricket captain. His outcry, nevertheless, has not
impressed the PCB," sources said. Meanwhile, manager of the
Pakistan cricket team Yawar Saeed said the four practice matches
would be held on Aug 11, 14, 17 and 20.

<a name="thre">Waqar threatens to quit if not consulted</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 7: Pakistan captain Waqar Younis demanded more say in
selections and threatened that he would not play if his views on
team compositions were not given due consideration. Waqar, who
looked fit and enthusiastic, revealed that he had not been
consulted on the selection of 27 probables.

"I would like to have more say in team selections. If the selectors
won't listen to me, I will not play," Waqar warned a week after
being retained captain until the home series against New Zealand.
Waqar's stubborn and apparently inflexible stand clearly conveys
the message that no matter what steps the cricket managers take to
include Wasim Akram, he would decide the fate of his one-time
deadly new ball partner.

In an apparent somersault, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said
last week that practice matches would be organized and those not
invited to the camp would be considered for selection if they
impressed in those matches.

Waqar rested all the blame on the selectors for the omission of
former captains Wasim Akram and Moin Khan. "I was told at the last
minute about the 27 probables. I can't say if I had pressed for the
inclusion of senior players had I been consulted. But I was told
late that Wasim had not been invited for the camp," the skipper
told reporters.

The paceman said the selectors should be questioned what was the
basis of selecting 27 probables for the camp. He, however, said he
believes that the selectors wouldn't have considered them good
enough to be invited. "I mean the best players are in the camp and
the immediate answer to the exclusion of senior players means they
might not be good enough. But I am not talking specifically of
Wasim or Moin, there were some deserving young boys who have not
been called."

When asked if he was satisfied with the probables at his disposal
in the background that Mohammad Sami, Shabbir Ahmad and Shoaib
Akhtar lack match fitness, Waqar said: "I can't say if I am
satisfied because I have not been consulted on these players. "I
have been given these boys to prepare for the season but that
doesn't mean that they form the nucleus." Waqar said Wasim has
never been a "problematic" character for him. "It is insulting for
a great cricketer to say that he has been dropped or discarded.

"The simple fact is that when you struggle, you take time off and
sort out things," Waqar, who has seen rough times in the recent
past, remarked. The toe-crusher, however, later toed the line of
the selectors and the administrators when he said the policy of the
PCB is to prepare a young team for the 2003 World Cup. He said
inviting more youngsters could be in line with that strategy
because more players in the camp means lesser opportunity for the
youngsters to impress the selectors.

Waqar said he would ensure that there was no inconsistency in
selection because he thought it was also one of the reasons for
Pakistan's four successive home series losses. "I haven't played
much in those series' and was only called in the last games or so,
but I will try to end the win drought and see that there were not
many changes in the team." Waqar said he was satisfied at being
retained captain for the first half of the international season and
he was also personally keen to judge his fitness and form on
series-by-series basis.

"In the past, a captain has been appointed on a long term basis but
has been sacked if his performance drops in two series'. By going
on series-by-series basis, the captain can be replaced but not
sacked," he said with direct reference to Moin Khan.

Waqar said the entire forthcoming season would be important but the
showpiece match would be the Test against India at Lahore from Sept
12 and 16. "It (match against India) will be the most important and
showpiece game of the season. I am anxiously looking forward to
it."

<a name="saee">Saeed admits he could be next on the chopping block</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 9: Former captain Saeed Anwar admitted that he could
be next on the chopping block. "Definitely, I could be the next and
it is in the back of my mind," the left-handed opener told
reporters at the National Stadium.

The Pakistan selectors sent a loud and clear message to the rest of
the players that no one should consider themselves "indispensable"
and shouldn't expect any sympathy from them as found out by Wasim
Akram and Moin Khan. "I have made five comebacks through my
performances. It's my belief that if I continue to perform, I will
not be dropped. The only way to avoid the axe is performance" Saeed
said.

The computer engineer is believed to be the next whom the selectors
will be looking to replace, particularly after he had a lean time
in Tests. His last 10 innings have only produced 183 runs with just
one half century against England at Faisalabad. However, Saeed's
performance in the one-dayers has been brilliant though he has yet
to score a century in 16 matches. He aggregates 661 runs at 41.3.

"There are always ups and downs. But for me, form has never been a
problem. It's the fitness which has restricted me from playing big
innings. I haven't had a chance to reclaim fitness because of a
packed international calendar," Saeed, whose fitness graph has
plunged because of knee injuries, said.

Saeed's both the knees were required treatment last year and he
took a three-month lay-off from cricket. But he believed knee
injuries sometimes took eight to 12 months to heel completely. "I
have now started taking injections and feel more comfortable. I am
looking forward to regaining my form and fitness this season," he
said.

Saeed admitted that a player should be dropped if he doesn't
perform but urged the selectors to give the out-of-form player of
proven ability proper opportunity and confidence to regain form.

Saeed also defended himself by saying that inconsistency at the
highest level in the last 18 months have also affected his and
team's performance.

"There have been so many changes in the administration and team
which have directly affected the players. New people bring in new
theories and everyone looks upon me and asks me to perform
according to his likings and planning�s. "Then there is always a
new (opening) partner with me which automatically puts me under
pressure," Saeed, who has had more than a dozen partners since
Aamir Sohail fell out with the administrators, said.

Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 7: Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) authorities are still
trying to persuade Richard Pybus to change his mind and resume his
duties as coach of the team for the forthcoming season.

Skipper Waqar Younis told reporters that he had convinced the PCB
officials to get in touch with the England-born South Africa- based
coach as he was the right choice. Although no official of the PCB
was available to confirm or deny the story, sources said the PCB
has offered Pybus a short-term contract. "He has been offered a
three-month contract until the tri-nation one-day tournament in
Sharjah in November," sources said.

The sources added that Pybus has not spurned the offer and has
instead asked for a week's time before he conveys his decision.
Pybus, last month had declined to continue as coach because of
domestic commitments.
