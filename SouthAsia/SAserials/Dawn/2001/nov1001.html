<A NAME="osam">Osama claims he has nukes</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hamid Mir

KABUL, Nov 9: Osama bin Laden has said that "we have chemical and
nuclear weapons as a deterrent and if America used them against us
we reserve the right to use them". He said this in a special
interview with Hamid Mir, the editor of Ausaf, for Dawn and Ausaf,
at an undisclosed location near Kabul.

This was the first interview given by Osama to any journalist after
the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington.

The correspondent was taken blind folded in a jeep from Kabul on
the night of Nov 7 to a place where it was extremely cold and one
could hear the sound of anti-aircraft guns firing away. After a
wait of some time , Osama arrived with about a dozen bodyguards and
Dr Ayman Al-Zuwahiri and answered questions.

Hamid Mir: After American bombing on Afghanistan on Oct 7, you told
the Al-Jazeera TV that the Sept 11 attacks had been carried out by
some Muslims. How did you know they were Muslims ?

Osama bin Laden: The Americans themselves released a list of the
suspects of the Sept 11 attacks, saying that the persons named were
involved in the attacks. They were all Muslims, of whom 15 belonged
to Saudi Arabia, two were from the UAE and one from Egypt.
According to the information I have, they were all passengers.
Fateha was held for them in their homes. But America said they were
hijackers.

HM: In your statement of Oct 7, you expressed satisfaction over the
Sept 11 attacks, although a large number of innocent people
perished in them, hundreds among them were Muslims. Can you justify
the killing of innocent men in the light of Islamic teachings ?

OBL: This is a major point in jurisprudence. In my view, if an
enemy occupies a Muslim territory and uses common people as human
shield, then it is permitted to attack that enemy. For instance, if
bandits barge into a home and hold a child hostage, then the
child's father can attack the bandits and in that attack even the
child may get hurt.

America and its allies are massacring us in Palestine, Chechenya,
Kashmir and Iraq. The Muslims have the right to attack America in
reprisal. The Islamic Shariat says Muslims should not live in the
land of the infidel for long. The Sept 11 attacks were not targeted
at women and children. The real targets were America's icons of
military and economic power.

The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) was against killing women and
children. When he saw a dead woman during a war, he asked why was
she killed ? If a child is above 13 and wields a weapon against
Muslims, then it is permitted to kill him.

The American people should remember that they pay taxes to their
government, they elect their president, their government
manufactures arms and gives them to Israel and Israel uses them to
massacre Palestinians. The American Congress endorses all
government measures and this proves that the entire America is
responsible for the atrocities perpetrated against Muslims. The
entire America, because they elect the Congress.

I ask the American people to force their government to give up
anti-Muslim policies. The American people had risen against their
government's war in Vietnam. They must do the same today. The
American people should stop the massacre of Muslims by their
government.

HM: Can it be said that you are against the American government,
not the American people ?

OSB: Yes! We are carrying on the mission of our Prophet, Muhammad
(peace be upon him). The mission is to spread the word of God, not
to indulge massacring people. We ourselves are the target of
killings, destruction and atrocities. We are only defending
ourselves. This is defensive Jihad. We want to defend our people
and our land. That is why I say that if we don't get security, the
Americans, too would not get security.

This is a simple formula that even an American child can
understand. This is the formula of live and let live.

HM: The head of Egypt's Jamia Al-Azhar has issued a fatwa (edict)
against you, saying that the views and beliefs of Osama bin Laden
have nothing to do with Islam. What do you have to say about that ?

OSB: The fatwa of any official Aalim has no value for me. History
is full of such Ulema who justify Riba, who justify the occupation
of Palestine by the Jews, who justify the presence of American
troops around Harmain Sharifain. These people support the infidels
for their personal gain. The true Ulema support the Jihad against
America. Tell me if Indian forces invaded Pakistan what would you
do? The Israeli forces occupy our land and the American troops are
on our territory. We have no other option but to launch Jihad.

HM: Some Western media claim that you are trying to acquire
chemical and nuclear weapons. How much truth is there in such
reports?

OSB: I heard the speech of American President Bush yesterday (Oct
7). He was scaring the European countries that Osama wanted to
attack with weapons of mass destruction. I wish to declare that if
America used chemical or nuclear weapons against us, then we may
retort with chemical and nuclear weapons. We have the weapons as
deterrent.

HM: Where did you get these weapons from ?

OSB: Go to the next question.

HM: Demonstrations are being held in many European countries
against American attacks on Afghanistan. Thousands of the
protesters were non-Muslims. What is your opinion about those non-
Muslim protesters ?

OSB: There are many innocent and good-hearted people in the West.
American media instigates them against Muslims. However, some good-
hearted people are protesting against American attacks because
human nature abhors injustice.

The Muslims were massacred under the UN patronage in Bosnia. I am
ware that some officers of the State Department had resigned in
protest. Many years ago the US ambassador in Egypt had resigned in
protest against the policies of President Jimmy Carter. Nice and
civilized are everywhere. The Jewish lobby has taken America and
the West hostage.

HM: Some people say that war is no solution to any issue. Do you
think that some political formula could be found to stop the
present war ?

OSB: You should put this question to those who have started this
war. We are only defending ourselves.

HM: If America got out of Saudi Arabia and the Al-Aqsa mosque was
liberated, would you then present yourself for trial in some Muslim
country ?

OSB: Only Afghanistan is an Islamic country. Pakistan follows the
English law. I don't consider Saudi Arabia an Islamic country. If
the Americans have charges against me, we too have a charge sheet
against them.

HM: Pakistan government decided to cooperate with America after
Sept 11, which you don't consider right. What do you think Pakistan
should have done but to cooperate with America ?

OSB: The government of Pakistan should have the wishes of the
people in view. It should not have surrendered to the unjustified
demands of America. America does not have solid proof against us.
It just has some surmises. It is unjust to start bombing on the
basis of those surmises.

HM: Had America decided to attack Pakistan with the help of India
and Israel, what would have we done ?

OSB: What has America achieved by attacking Afghanistan ? We will
not leave the Pakistani people and the Pakistani territory at
anybody's mercy. We will defend Pakistan. But we have been
disappointed by Gen Pervez Musharraf. He says that the majority is
with him. I say the majority is against him.

Bush has used the word crusade. This is a crusade declared by Bush.
It is no wisdom to barter off blood of Afghan brethren to improve
Pakistan's economy. He will be punished by the Pakistani people and
Allah.

Right now a great war of Islamic history is being fought in
Afghanistan. All the big powers are united against Muslims. It is '
sawab ' to participate in this war.

HM: A French newspaper has claimed that you had kidney problem and
had secretly gone to Dubai for treatment last year. Is that correct
?

OSB: My kidneys are all right. I did not go to Dubai last year. One
British newspaper has published an imaginary interview with
Islamabad dateline with one of my sons who lives in Saudi Arabia.
All this is false.

HM: Is it correct that a daughter of Mulla Omar is your wife or
your daughter is Mulla Omar's wife ?

OSB: (Laughs). All my wives are Arabs ( and all my daughters are
married to Arab Mujahideen). I have spiritual relationship with
Mulla Omar. He is a great and brave Muslim of this age. He does not
fear anyone but Allah. He is not under any personal relationship or
obligation to me. He is only discharging his religious duty. I,
too, have not chosen this life out of any personal consideration.

<A NAME="tali">Taliban fighters taking shelter in refugee camps: UNHCR</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 7: The United Nations High Commission for Refugees
claimed that armed elements are taking shelter in refugee camps
near the borders making the delivery of humanitarian assistance
difficult.

A UNHCR press release said that civilians were mixed up with
Taliban fighters in all the refugee camps near the borders making
it extremely difficult for them to receive international assistance
without unintentionally feeding the war effort.

The UNHCR said that concerns about the safety of the Makaki site,
both for its inhabitants and for aid workers, have been reinforced
by repeated witness accounts of Taliban military presence inside
Makaki, as well as other military positions nearby.

"These accounts, which include photographic evidence, describe not
only the presence of armed Taliban soldiers inside the camp, but
also the presence of heavy machine-guns and multiple rocket
launchers," the UNHCR said.

The statement said that the UNHCR had frequently stressed that the
two camps in western Afghanistan, one in a Taliban-held area, and
the other in an area controlled by the Northern Alliance, in
addition to another camp in Spin Boldak, near the border with
Pakistan, and the two sites on the Pyanj river on the border with
Tajikistan, were extremely vulnerable to abuse by the warring
factions.

<A NAME="unpr">Unprovoked shelling by India, says Pakistan</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Nov 6: Pakistan accused India of launching a heavy
artillery and mortar barrage at civilian targets across the Kashmir
border. The barrage in the Neelum Valley region was accompanied by
small-arms fire in which one civilian was shot dead by an Indian
sniper, said DG ISPR Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi.

Another civilian suffered serious injuries from mortar splinters,
Gen Qureshi said, adding that Pakistani artillery units had
returned fire.

In New Delhi, an Indian defence ministry spokesman rejected the
allegations as "absolutely untrue". "There is nothing unusual
except for the routine firing that occurs all the time at our
borders and this allegation is absolutely untrue," the spokesman
said. "It is also a routine Pakistani allegation," the official
added.-AFP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 7: Special Advisor to the President on strategic
studies Dr Ishfaq Ahmad said that the design life of the Karachi
Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) was extended for another 20 years
through indigenous efforts.

"Nuclear power plants never retires as the continuous running of
these plants is always advisable since its decommissioning is
hazardous environmentally," the former chairman of the Pakistan
Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) observed.

The nuclear technology has the ability to contribute in a
significant manner to address all issues of sustainable
development, he said adding that it was essential in the Pakistani
perspective for increasing electricity demand for the development,
existing infrastructure and manpower. He also suggested to look for
new designs of the nuclear power plants which were safer than the
old designs.

<A NAME="paki">Pakistan N-arms in safe hands: Rumsfeld</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NEW DELHI, Nov 5: US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld brushed
aside fears about Pakistan's nuclear arsenal after talks in India
at the end of a five-nation trip. Mr Rumsfeld said Washington was
not worried about Islamabad's nuclear weapons getting into the
wrong hands.

"I do not personally believe that there is a risk with respect to
countries that have nuclear weapons," Rumsfeld said at a news
conference with Indian Defence Minister George Fernandes.

"The countries that have nuclear weapons have a healthy respect of
the power and lethality of these weapons and they take steps to
manage their safe handling," Rumsfeld said in response to a
question about Pakistan.

Rumsfeld said he and Fernandes "talked about terrorism in the
broader sense, which has affected both our countries". "The effort
against terrorism is a global one and involves terrorists wherever
they are. This is much bigger than Afghanistan," he said.

Afghanistan only "happens to be the first problem. The president
(George W. Bush) has been unambiguous that we will tackle terrorism
wherever it is," he added.-AFP

<A NAME="thre">Three die as protesters, police clash</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Nadeem Saeed and Tariq Birmani

DERA GHAZI KHAN, Nov 9: At least three people were killed and
several others injured in a clash between protesters and personnel
of law enforcement agencies near Dera Ghazi Khan on the eve of
country-wide wheel-jam strike called by the religious organizations
to condemn US-led attacks on Afghanistan.

Madressa students and their supporters, stopped the 21-Up Chiltan
Express near Shahdan Lond Railway Station, by placing boulders on
the railway track. Kala police reached the troubled spot after
calling for reinforcement to combat the situation in Shahdan-Lond.
The police along with area union council Nazim Sardar Javed Lond
stared negotiations with the protesters to get removed the hurdles
to normalize the railway traffic.

When the negotiations failed, the protesters reportedly started
pelting stones on police. At this, the police resorted to shelling
teargas to disperse the protesters. But the violent mob was not
inclined to yield.

As the reinforcement had yet to reach the spot, the policemen
combating the protesters at that time opened fire. Later, the mob
went on a rampage spree and reportedly set ablaze a number of
official vehicles. The violent protesters also 'kidnapped' some
police officials who were sitting at the rooftop of the house of
Seth Abdul Majeed after giving them a sound thrashing on the spot.

The number of kidnapped police officials could not be ascertained
exactly as the area people put it at two while the DIG Dera Range,
Anwar Pasha, told Dawn that four police officials had been
kidnapped. The kidnapped officials could not be rescued till the
time of filing this report.

Similarly, some protesters blocked the railway traffic near Kot
Addu railway station by placing hurdles on the track on a railway
crossing. Consequently, at least four passenger trains were
standing at various spots of Kot Addu section. Chiltan was stopped
at Shahdan Lond, Khushal Express at Taunsa Barrage, 189-Up at
Sinawa and 1890-Down at Daira Din Panah.

Earlier reportedly the madressa students blocked the inter-
provincial Indus highway in protest. During this time a prisoners-
carrying van was coming from Taunsa Sharif carrying religious
leaders arrested during the midnight crackdown ahead of the strike.
On seeing the students at the road the arrested leaders started
chanting slogans. At this, the protesters went further violent and
tried to get released their leaders. It is learnt that they
succeeded in setting free a number of arrested ulema and thereafter
set the van on fire.

DIG Anwar Pasha though confirmed that the prisoners-van was
intercepted and later on set ablaze by the protesters but denied
that they managed to get released the arrested ulema. He said the
van was being escorted by two police mobiles which were later used
to take back the ulema to Taunsa.

Both railway traffic on Kot Addu section and vehicular traffic on
Indus highway could not be restored till evening.

<A NAME="noqu">No question of instability in Pakistan: Musharraf</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, Nov 8: President General Pervez Musharraf dismissed talk of
any instability and said vast majority of Pakistanis supported his
decision to back the international coalition in the fight against
terrorism.

Addressing Pakistani community here soon after his arrival, General
Musharraf said Pakistan had to play a significant role and "we
should have conviction in our stand" to side with the world in its
campaign against terrorism.

He said there was "no problem, no instability" at home or any
danger to his government otherwise "I will not be sitting here."

"Our Army is extremely disciplined Army. The Army is with me and
they will always remain behind me. I am the leader and they will
follow me," said President General Pervez Musharraf.

The president said he had issued an ordinance to check spread of
hatred against any sect and the law enforcement agencies would take
strict action against those trying to do so. There is a very small
religious extremist minority which had brought the people onto the
streets and they were joined by Afghans living in Pakistan.-APP

Dawn Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov 8: The administrations of the twin cities of
Rawalpindi and Islamabad have launched crackdown on religious
groups and arrested several frontline leaders and activists from
different parts of the twin cities ahead of countrywide strike,
sources told Dawn.

The call to observe countrywide wheeljam strike has been given by
the Afghan Defence Council (ADC), an alliance of religious parties,
protesting against the government's decision to support the US in
the fight against terrorism.

The sources said many activists of religious groups and political
parties, who had been criticizing the government's policies during
the protests for the past several days, were arrested under
Maintenance of Public Order (MPO-16). It has been learnt that more
arrests would be made during the night.

However, the Islamabad police confirmed the arrest of only Sajid
Abbasi, an active member of Muslim Students Federation (MSF). He
has been detained by the Industrial Area police.

KARACHI, Nov 9: The government will pursue sedition cases against

said interior minister Moinuddin Haider.

Anyone challenging the writ of the government, working against the
national interest and trying to incite the armed forces would be
dealt with sternly, said Mr Haider at a news conference.

Sedition cases have, so far, been instituted against the JI chief
Qazi Hussain Ahmed and the JUI chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman.

Mr Haider did not say when the government would move the court.

Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Nov 6: Chief of Jamaat-i-Islami Qazi Hussain Ahmad said
that it was General Musharraf who must be charged with sedition for
suspending the Constitution. "The basic question is, is Gen
Musharraf the sole custodian of the national interest?

"His is an illegal and unconstitutional government�. He is the one
who has committed sedition", he told Dawn on telephone from his
house in Palosai, Peshawar. "In a national crisis, a national
consensus government is formed. Here we have an acute national
crisis but unfortunately a single man is the incharge of the
destiny of the nation."

He said that he had been charged with sedition before as well but
no government had ever dared brought the case to the courts. "Let
the government bring the case to the court and we will see it."

<A NAME="file">Qazi files amended petition against detention</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Nov 8: Jamaat-i-Islami chief Qazi Hussain Ahmad filed an
amended writ petition in the Peshawar High Court after his shifting
to Thanda Dam rest house by the government.

The earlier writ petition, challenging the JI chief's house arrest
by the provincial government, was withdrawn as the nature of the
case had changed after shifting him to the rest house from his
residence.

A division bench comprising Justice Nasirul Mulk and Justice
Shahjehan Khan Yousafzai took up for preliminary hearing the
earlier writ petition. However, a panel of lawyers representing
Qazi Hussain Ahmad, including Arif Khan, Arbab Usman and others,
informed the bench that they had decided to withdraw the petition
and they should be allowed to file an amended writ petition.

The court allowed them to withdraw the petition with the permission
to file an amended petition.

Later, another petition was filed on behalf of JI's chief. Through
the amended petition, Qazi Hussain Ahmad prayed to the court that
the impugned order issued by the provincial government of keeping
him in the Thanda Dam Rest House be declared as illegal and against
the law.

The JI chief stated that on Nov 3 the Secretary of Home Department
had served a notice on him wherein he had been directed not to
reside, remain or enter any part of the Bajaur Agency.
Subsequently, he added, the provincial government issued another
order bearing No. 13/5-SOS-I(HD) 2001 on Nov 5, putting him under
house arrest. Later, the petitioner stated he was shifted to the
rest house from his house.

He said that he got no other remedy except to invoke the
extraordinary jurisdiction of the high court for redressal of his
grievances. He contended that the impugned order was mala fide as
the activities of the petitioner were not prejudicial to the public
peace and tranquillity.

The respondents in the petition are Government of NWFP, Secretary
to Government of NWFP, Home and Tribal Affairs Department, district
coordinating officer, Peshawar, district Nazim, Peshawar,
Inspector-general of Police, NWFP, deputy inspector-general of
police, Peshawar, and senior superintendent of police, Peshawar.

A sedition case was also registered against Qazi Hussain Ahmad in
Mardan for addressing a public meeting on Nov 2, in which he was
accused of having urged the people to rise in revolt against the
state.

<A NAME="chie">Jamaat chief charged with sedition</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Nov 5: Mardan police has booked Jamaat-i-Islami chief
Qazi Hussain Ahmad, charging him with sedition for making a
provocative speech against the government, a senior police officer
said.

The case against Qazi was registered at Police Station, 'A'
Division for his speech in Mardan under section 124-A, 153, 153-A
of the Criminal Procedure Code. The sedition charge carries a
maximum penalty of life imprisonment.

"Qazi has been charged with inciting the public against the
government and President Gen Pervez Musharraf," the officer told
Dawn. A government official, however, clarified that Qazi's house
detention had nothing to do with the case.

Earlier on Monday, the NWFP government issued an order placing Qazi
Hussain Ahmad under house arrest for one month. The detention has
come under Maintenance of Public Order (MPO-3).

The Jamaat-i-Islami has vowed to challenge the detention in the
Peshawar High Court and has constituted a panel of lawyers to file
the writ petition. The official clarified that prior to the latest
order placing Qazi under house arrest, the JI leader had merely
been restrained from proceeding to Bajaur Agency to address a
public rally in the federally administered tribal area.

The JI provincial secretary information Faqeerullah told Dawn that
the NWFP Secretary Home and Tribal Affairs issued Qazi's house
arrest order this morning and deployed police force outside his
residence at Palosay near University of Peshawar.

Qazi Hussain Ahmad was to address an anti-America rally in Liaqat
Bagh, Rawalpindi on Nov 9. Meanwhile, the Afghanistan Defence
Council held a meeting at Almarkaz-i-Islami Peshawar to discuss the
arrangements for a countrywide strike.

<A NAME="pppg">PPP, govt 'very close' to finalizing deal</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Nov 8: The government and PPP are reportedly "very
close" to finalizing a deal under which Ms Benazir Bhutto will be
able to come back to the country without any fear of going to jail
and Asif Ali Zardari, imprisoned since 1996, will come out of jail,
Dawn has learnt from reliable sources.

Negotiations are still going on to finalize the deal. After PPP
team's meeting with President Pervez Musharraf on Monday, PPP
leaders sounded very "optimistic."

According to an insider dealing with legal affairs of the party, it
has been agreed that Ms Bhutto would not be arrested on her return.
She would file an application in the Accountability Court,
Rawalpindi, demanding that her conviction on the charges of non-
appearance in the court should be recalled.

The government, the sources said, had given an assurance that the
application would be accepted and conviction order passed under
section 31 of the NAB Ordinance recalled.

Ms Bhutto, facing four corruption cases, was convicted in April
1999 by an Ehtesab Bench headed by Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum on
the charges of awarding pre-shipment contract to a Swiss firm for
personal considerations.

The conviction was not only set aside but also the judge who had
handed down the judgment, had to leave the judicial institution
after being declared "biased" by the SC on the appeals of Ms Bhutto
and Asif Ali Zardari.

Mr Zardari, behind the bar since 1996, is carrying no conviction so
far. His conviction in pre-shipment case in 1999, was set aside by
the Supreme Court and matter was remanded to the competent court.

The accountability court, however, has taken up the case but it is
still at "notice stage".

There are a total of 12 cases against Mr Zardari. Six pertain to
his alleged corruption and six others are criminal cases, including
four murder cases. He has been granted bail by courts in 10 cases
so far and the bail application in the 11th case will be taken up
on Nov 23.

The chances of his getting bail from the Lahore High Court,
Rawalpindi bench, in the 11th case, (Polo ground reference), are
also bright.

The other case in which Mr Zardari has not been granted bail is
about Narcotics, which is pending in the sessions court, Lahore.
The bail application is pending for one year in the case and if the
deal is struck Mr Zardari would be given bail in that case also.

In murder cases, Mr Zardari was granted bail in Justice Nizam,
Murtaza Bhutto and secretary Alam Baloch's cases. He is also facing
a case of suicide.

Soon after the PPP leaders' meeting with President Pervez
Musharraf, Hakim Ali Zardari, father of Asif Ali Zardari, was
shifted to his house.

The other beneficiaries of the deal would be Naveed Qamar, former
chairman of Privatisation Commission, and Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani,
former Speaker of the National Assembly.

Mr Qamar is behind the bar for the last two years, but his case is
still nowhere and he would be out of the jail on bail. Similarly,
Mr Yousaf Raza Gillani, who held a very important constitutional
post, is being prosecuted for misuse of official telephone
facility.

<A NAME="pppr">PPP rejects govt contention on Benazir's return</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 7: Acting secretary-general of Pakistan People's
Party (PPP) Mian Raza Rabbani has rejected the contention of Maj-
Gen Rashed Qureshi that Benazir Bhutto's return to the country
depended on the courts.

In a statement issued Mr Rabbani said though the PPP respected the
judiciary, it was against setting up of special courts. He said the
party also opposed the special laws that were being introduced by
the government for political purposes.

The PPP leader said NAB, by misusing the accountability law and
manipulating special courts, had turned itself into a state
institution of kidnapping for ransom. "That is why the PPP believes
that the issue of Ms Benazir's safe return still needed to be
addressed by the government rather than by the courts. He recalled
that the regime released former prime minister Nawaz Sharif despite
the fact that he was convicted by court.

Mr Rabbani said if the regime could remove judges, it could also
give assurances of Benazir Bhutto's safe return. He said the
divergence in opinion between the regime and the PPP on the
assurance issue was just one of the many differences between the
PPP and the military regime.

He said dialogue was held on several occasions for redressal of
grievances, and though there had been some confidence building,
there was still a big gap which needed to be filled.

By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Nov 6: Maj-Gen Rashid Qureshi, spokesman for president,
said that there was no government ban on the return of People's
Party Chairperson Benazir Bhutto to Pakistan but said she would
have to face legal procedure and face the court and "that is
something which is between her and the court".

Gen Qureshi said that the president's meeting with the PPP
delegation was one of similar meetings held with leaders of various
other parties as well, most of whom expressed support to Gen
Musharraf and his government for the decision taken to support
coalition forces.

Gen Qureshi further said that no one should read too much in such
meetings as there were no specific purposes. The idea was to
interact with political leaders and exchange views on national and
other issues and updating (on the situation) by the government on
the Afghanistan situation. The president's spokesman seemed to
suggest that Gen Musharraf had offered no quid pro quo to the PPP
for its support to the president's policy on the Afghanistan
operation by the United States.

<A NAME="pres">President holds talks with PPP leaders</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Nov 5: A four-member delegation of Pakistan People's
Party led by Senior Vice Chairman Makhdoom Amin Fahim called on
President Gen Pervez Musharraf and demanded safe return of party's
Chairperson Benazir Bhutto.

The government and PPP central secretariat issued separate
statements on the hour-long meeting of the President with the PPP
leaders, in which former senator Qaim Ali Shah, Punjab PPP Chief
Qasim Zia and PPP Frontier Chief Khawaja Muhammad Khan Hoti were
also included.

The government and the PPP statements had very little in common.
The latter focused on the demands made by it at the meeting while
the former highlighted President's assertions. However, an inside
party source said there was a strong view in the party that it
should not go to the extent that it would be seen as an ally of the
military government. "There was convergence of views between the
party and government over the issue of supporting international
coalition in its fight against terrorism," the source said.
However, the source said, a sizeable number of PPP leaders wanted
that the party should preserve and maintain its distinction of
opposing non-democratic regimes.

A PPP source termed the meeting with the President positive, saying
it was held in a very cordial atmosphere. The President seemed
quite receptive towards the demands made by the party leaders, the
source asserted.

He was quite optimistic about the release of some of the PPP
leaders languishing in jails on charges of corruption. The party
was expecting release of Hakim Ali Zardari and Naveed Qamar
shortly.

On the issue of Ms Bhutto's return to the country, nothing was
officially said from both sides.

The party claimed that it also sought an end to what it termed one-
sided accountability solely directed against the political
leadership of the country, stressing that the ongoing
accountability was politically-motivated. It also demanded release
of former senator Asif Ali Zardari, Vice Chairman Yousaf Raza
Gillani, Secretary-General Jehangir Badr, former chairman of
privatization commission Naveed Qamar and all other PPP leaders
detained on politically-motivated charges and also the withdrawal
of the politically-motivated cases.

President's spokesman Gen Rashid Qureshi quoted the President as
saying that it was essential for all Pakistanis, irrespective of
their political and party affiliations, to rise to the occasion and
play a positive role for safeguarding national integrity, unity and
solidarity at this critical juncture in the history of the country.

He said during the meeting with political leaders, the President
exchanged views on a number of issues of national importance as
well as the prevailing situation in the region with special
reference to Afghanistan. He said all the decisions and necessary
steps taken by the government were in the supreme national
interest. The president, he said, apprised them of his meetings and
telephonic conversations with various world leaders including those
of the Muslim Ummah.

The President also reaffirmed his commitment of holding elections
in Oct 2002 as directed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.

The PPP leaders said that the party had noted the assurances of the
military regime that the elections would be fair, free and
impartial. In this connection, the PPP sought some steps to be
taken by the government to substantiate its declaration. The steps
were: first, the minorities should be allowed the right to vote in
every single electoral precinct through joint electorate; two,
multi-identity should be introduced; three, the decentralized
district returning electoral count system should be adhered to; and
four, there should be a mechanism acceptable to political parties
for the transfer of officials, against whom charges of election
interference have been made.

The PPP also demanded that economic relief be provided to the
common citizen, including the reversal of the plan to remove
assistant commissioners recruited in Sindh during 1988-90 and 1993-
96.

The party leaders said the party was against terrorism in any form
and voiced support for the objective of a broad-based government in
Afghanistan. They called upon President Musharraf to open a
dialogue with political parties to broaden the political base of
the country at a time of grave national and international crisis.

KARACHI, Nov 7: An Accountability court dismissed an application of

proceedings of a corruption reference against her till her return
to the country.

The reference against Benazir Bhutto pertained to 1,393 illegal
appointments and promotions in different cadres and postings abroad
in violation of rules during her last tenure as prime minister.

Saying that the request for adjournment for an indefinite period
could not be granted, Judge Muhammed Jawaid Alam fixed Nov 16 for
recording the statement of the accused persons in the case and
ordered that Benazir Bhutto should either record her statement
before the court herself or through her counsel.

The others, charged with corruption with the former prime minister,
were Air Vice Marshal (retd) Umer Farooq, former PIA chief; Naheed
Khan, Ghulam Hussain Kazi, Ghulam Qadir Shah Jamote, Siraj

<A NAME="post">Benazir postpones return to Pakistan</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, Nov 3: Benazir Bhutto has postponed her return to Pakistan
indefinitely due to the fear of being killed by the Taliban or Al-
Qaeda networks. According to well-placed intelligence sources, the
Pakistan People's Party chairperson, who has been denied an
additional passport book or more leaves for the travel document for
unspecified reasons since last month, had formerly decided to
return sometime in November.

The sources said she had been given assurances by the present
government that some kind of deal or deals that had been discussed
in the past could come under discussion again. Such a proposition,
the sources said, was subject to her presence in the country with
her wholehearted support to the government's internal and external
policies with regard to the Afghanistan crisis.

However, the sources added, Benazir had to change her decision
following receipt of information that she might be target of an
assassination attack if she returned to the country.

The sources said her statements against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda
networks following the attack on the World Trade Center and the
Pentagon were taken by extremist elements in Pakistan and
Afghanistan seriously. They said Benazir had received incriminating
evidence suggesting an attack or attacks on her life if she entered
Pakistan after her three years absence.

When the acting secretary-general of the PPP, Mian Raza Rabbani,
was contacted, he rejected the impression that Benazir was afraid
of the Taliban or the Al-Qaeda. "The timeframe of her return will
be decided by the central executive committee of the party alone,"
he told by telephone from Islamabad.

LAUSANNE, Nov 5: Switzerland's high court has decided to let
Pakistan have Swiss bank documents tied to former prime minister
Benazir Bhutto and two family members, a Swiss justice ministry
spokesman said.

"The highest court decided the evidence can be released to
Pakistan," said spokesman Folco Galli, adding the documents should
be sent off soon.

The Swiss Federal Court in Lausanne published its ruling on the
Internet showing it had rejected pleas by three unnamed companies
which had sought to bar release of the information to Pakistani
authorities. The documents pertain to accounts held in Geneva in a
subsidiary of Barclays Bank and at UBS AG, the court said.

In 1997 Swiss legal authorities seized documents and froze around
20 million francs in bank accounts belonging to Benazir Bhutto,
husband Asif Zardari, and her mother.

Geneva's justice authorities also are conducting a separate legal
proceeding against Ms Bhutto.-Reuters

ISLAMABAD, Nov 8: The government asked the Afghan embassy to close
down its Karachi consulate and immediately withdraw all its staff
stationed there.

"We have asked the Afghanistan embassy to withdraw all the
personnel from its Karachi consulate except the caretakers," FO
Spokesman Aziz Khan said at the daily briefing.

The Afghan embassy in Islamabad and its consulates in Quetta and
Peshawar would function normally, Mr Khan said.

The foreign office gave no reason for the decision to close down
the consulate in Karachi, however an official said that it might
have been done because of violent anti-US demonstrations recently
held in Karachi.

To a question whether the decisions to stop Afghan Ambassador Mulla
Mohammad Zaeef from holding press conferences and to close down
consulate in Karachi had been taken under the US pressures, Mr Khan
said that the Afghan ambassador was reminded of the third country
rule and was asked to a observe diplomatic norms.

He said that Afghan ambassador had not been barred from holding
press conferences. "He has been asked to observe third country
rules," he said.

On the reports that the US embassy was also indulging in propaganda
against the Taliban, the spokesman said that the third country rule
was equally applicable to the US embassy. "At present we have no
information of the Americans in Pakistan misusing their diplomatic
privilege by indulging in anti-Taliban propaganda."

The MJC said that the US decision to freeze the accounts of

base to strengthen India's unending repression in Kashmir."

The Bush administration had imposed stringent financial sanctions
on the Harkatul Mujahideen organization, fighting Indian rule in
Kashmir.

Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 3: Foreign Office denied Indian allegation about
Pakistan's military build-up in the Sir Creek areas and termed
these charges baseless and a figment of imagination.

In an official handout the Foreign Office said the dispute in Sir
Creek area stemmed from India's refusal to demarcate the land
boundary in accordance with the Resolution Map-44 of 1914 which had
been accepted as "the most authentic Map," by the Ran of Kutch
arbitration Tribunal in 1968-69.

The spokesman pointed out that demarcation of land boundary in Sir
Creek area was also crucial for determining the land terminus for
the delimitation of the maritime boundary as well as the
determination of the exclusive economic zones of the two countries.

He urged India to agree on the demarcation of the land boundary in
Sir Creek area on the basis of the resolution Map of 1914 and
desist from making unfounded and preposterous allegations against
Pakistan.

In another statement the government condemns the attempt on the
life of senior APHC Abdul Ghani Lone on the night of November 1. Mr
Lone's residence in Rawalpura, on the outskirts of Srinagar, was
attacked by unknown gunmen. The circumstances surrounding this
reprehensible incident strongly point to the involvement of Indian
agencies. "The attack on Mr Lone is a part of the larger Indian
policy to weaken the freedom struggle by eliminating its leaders
and by spreading terror among the people of occupied Kashmir. The
government reminds that India will held responsible for any harm to
the APHC leaders." it added.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Nov 3: President General Pervez Musharraf has directed
the officials of the Ministry of Finance and Planning Commission to
change the whole economic and development strategy of the country
to minimize serious effects on the economy being experienced in the
wake of September 11 terror attacks on America.

Official sources said the president told the federal cabinet that
in the absence of much needed fiscal space, the government was left
with no option but to "make drastic re-adjustments" in its economic
and development strategy. The president directed the concerned
officials to urgently finalise a new strategy to meet the new
situation as only financial pledges and commitments have been made
by different countries but nothing has actually come in the kitty.

Sources said that as per the directive of the president, the work
on a number of mega development projects has been halted.
"Initially we have decided to pull out roughly Rs 12 billion from
National Drainage Program, Flood Control project and Islamabad-
Peshawar motorway project", an official said.

When contacted, he said that Rs 12 billion will be used for
covering up revenues losses being experienced due to 30 per cent
reduction in exports.

If the current situation continued to persist, sources said, the
government will have to slash its Rs 120 billion Public Sector
Development Program (PSDP).

President Pervez Musharraf told the cabinet that he has been
receiving firm assurances from US led coalition for generous
financial support both in the shape of grants and soft loans along
with market access. However, he said that unless that support
materialises, he has no alternative but to ask the federal planners
to make drastic re-adjustments.

Official sources confirmed that US government has informed them
that "it could take several months" to finalise any greater
economic and financial package for Pakistan by Washington and other
International Financial Institutions (IFIs). "We have been told
that there is a genuine difficulty of getting everything cleared
from US Congress and other institutions", another official said

 KARACHI, Nov 8: Over four million Afghans have been affected by
the bombings of the US-led coalition and with the on set of
chilling winter they were threatened with annihilation due to
starvation, lack of food, medical aid and other supplies.

This was stated by Maulana Abdul Sattar Edhi who visited
Afghanistan to monitor relief work being carried out by Edhi
Foundation.

He feared that if the current situation persisted, number of such
people would swell to unmanageable level.

Maulana Edhi appreciated the sentiments of American people and the
government following Sept 11 tragedy, and plight of the Afghan
people and appealed to the United States to show restraint to
ensure that innocent Afghans were not made targets during air
strikes. Innocent people should not be killed in the war against
Taliban, he said.

Mr Edhi called for practical measures to help the needy Afghans,
who could die if warm clothing, food, medicines and other essential
items were not provided to them in time. He appealed to the people
around the globe to come forward and make generous donations to
save millions from being perished.

<A NAME="indi">India accuses Pakistan of harassing its diplomats</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Jawed Naqvi

NEW DELHI, Nov 9: India accused Pakistan of harassing its diplomats
in Islamabad, saying two of its officials were illegally roughed up
and searched by Pakistani intelligence officials.

According to a statement by the Indian foreign ministry, Pakistan's
High Commissioner Ashraf Jehangir Qazi was summoned to the ministry
where he was handed a strong protest about two separate incidents.
The statement said Qazi was summoned by a senior foreign ministry
official and told of the "Government of India's strong protest
about two very serious incidents of intimidation and harassment,
involving officials based at the Indian High Commission at
Islamabad.

"In the first incident, an official traveling by bus to Lahore en
route to the Indian border at Wagah-Attari, with his wife and son,
was accosted by an individual who introduced himself as an ISI
officer," the statement said.

When the bus arrived at Lahore, the person demanded to see the
contents of the bag being carried by the Indian official. Upon his
refusal to do so, the ISI official forcibly opened the bag. He also
sought to confiscate money but returned it when the Indian official
threatened to report the incident to the police. Thereafter, the
statement said, "the ISI official threatened the Indian official
with dire consequences if he returned to Pakistan. The Indian
official lodged an FIR at the Gulberg Police Station in Lahore."

Indian High Commissioner Vijay Nambiar also personally raised this
incident with the Pakistan Foreign Secretary on Thursday evening,
the statement said.

The second incident involving another staff member took place at
Islamabad later in the evening at around 9:00pm.

"The staff member accompanied by his wife was returning by taxi
from a public shopping area of Islamabad when they were intercepted
by at least eight Pakistani intelligence operatives driving in a
Landcruiser. The intelligence operatives dragged out both the staff
member and his wife," the Indian statement said. It added that the
wife was gagged and manhandled by an operative while being dragged
to one side. "In the process, she sustained scratch injuries to her
face."

The Indian staff member was then pulled into the Landcruiser and
driven away to an unknown destination. He was released the
following morning, in the early hours, in a badly beaten and
bruised state. An FIR has been lodged with the Kohsar Police
Station in Islamabad.

"Shri R.S. Kalha, Secretary in the Ministry of External Affairs,
conveyed Government of India's strong condemnation of these
reprehensible incidents, involving the forcible abduction,
harassment and assault of High Commission officials and their
family members," the foreign ministry statement said. "He also
conveyed the government's protest in the strongest possible terms
at the crude and uncivilized behaviour of Pakistan's intelligence
operatives that included the assault on the wife of one of the
staff members. The Pakistan High Commissioner was also reminded of
Pakistan's obligations under the Vienna Convention of 1960 and the
1992 Bilateral Code of Conduct for Treatment of Diplomatic/Consular
Personnel in India and Pakistan.

Kalha also demanded that appropriate action be taken by the
authorities in Pakistan against those responsible for the above
incidents.

The fact that the second incident took place soon after the Indian
High Commissioner had personally brought the first incident to the
attention of the Pakistan Foreign Secretary, "naturally raises
obvious questions," the statement said.

"These high-handed actions are in complete violation of the Vienna
Convention and the Bilateral Code of Conduct for the Treatment of
Diplomatic/Consular Personnel that has been agreed to by India and
Pakistan. Pakistan's regular and repeated transgressions of its
obligations in this manner form a consistent pattern and raise
serious questions about its attitude and approach to its
commitments under international and bilateral agreements," the
Indian statement said.

<A NAME="ptcl">PTCL jeopardizes survival of 19 ISPs</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Bahzad Alam Khan

KARACHI, Nov 5: Out of the 34 internet service providers operating
in the city, the survival of 19 ISPs, dealing with about 200,000
subscribers, has been endangered owing to lack of coordination
between the two departments of the Pakistan Telecommunication
Company, Dawn learnt.

The PTCL senior accounts officer of the international
telecommunication department, based in Islamabad, did not notify
the Karachi-based value-added services department, authorized to
issue demand notes to new ISPs in the city, that monthly charges
for digital cross connect (DXX) network for ISPs using shared
bandwidth, ranging between 192 kilobits per second and two megabits
per second, are not Rs55,000 as announced by the minister for
science and technology, Prof Attaur Rehman.

At a press conference in Islamabad on April 22, 2000, Prof Attaur
Rehman had announced that "the DXX charges, which were previously
Rs219,000 per month, will now be charged at a flat rate of Rs55,000
per month for data rates of 192 kilobits per second and above". He
added that the new tariff would come into effect from May 1, 2000.

The Islamabad-based senior accounts officer of the international
telecommunication department did not inform the Karachi-based
value-added services department that the DXX charges were not
applicable to the ISPs employing shared bandwidth. As a result, the
value-added services department not only continued to issue new
demand notes at the previous rates but also did not intimate the
ISPs using shared bandwidth that DXX charges were not Rs55,000 per
month.

The senior accounts officer of the international telecommunication
department made matters worse by not issuing a bill to the 19 ISPs
using shared bandwidth for the past 18 months.

Insiders said the following 19 ISPs had been affected by the PTCL's
lack of coordination: Compunet On Line, Crestar International,
Cubexs, Dancom Pakistan, Gem Internet Services, Netsol Connect,
Gerry's Information Tech, Humdard University, NED University of
Engineering, Net 2000 Communication, PICL Global Net, Robonet
Interaction, Sattech, South Asia Media Wise, Super Net PDS, Web Net
Comm Service, Pak Free, World Tel Meca (on I.I. Chundrigar Road)
and World Tel Meca (Dr Ziauddin Road).

auctionable cargoes at the Karachi Port. According to a handout
issued after the meeting, the ECC also decided to approve Model
Petroleum Concession Agreement to cut delays in seeking approval
for each concession agreement from the ministries concerned. The
Model Petroleum Concession Agreement reflects a number of fiscal
and operational incentives to the investors to attract investment
in the petroleum exploration and production sector as enshrined in
the new Onshore Petroleum Exploration and Petroleum Policy 2001
approved by the Cabinet in May 2001.

On the energy sector intercorporate circular debt, the ECC approved
several measures to clear the backlog by netting out payments by
various government entities. This will solve old issues and improve
the balance-sheet of state-owned companies.

and large the prices of consumer items had remained stable.
However, as a precaution, the meeting decided to direct the
provincial governments to ensure price stability during Ramazan. It
was also decided to ensure consumer quality items in the utility
stores.

The ECC noted with satisfaction the increase in foreign exchange
reserves, balance of payment position and volume of the exports.

The oil, wheat, fertilizer and sugar stock positions were also
reviewed and the meeting expressed its satisfaction over the
availability of sufficient stocks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

Poor Afghanistan. The Persian rule in Ashvagan ('land of horses')
as the area was then known, was overthrown in 1747 and a monarchy
established in the land thereafter to be known as Afghanistan. The
Shahs and Amirs ruled until 1973 when the country became a
republic. In 1994 the Taliban converted the republic into an
emirate.

The landlocked 251,824 square miles of territory has within in it
over 2,000 mountain peaks and over 8,000 caves. It has always been
fair game for any world power. First came the Greeks, to be
followed down the years by many, many others, and the latest game
is now in the throes of being played by the mighty US. No matter
who has ruled over it, from conqueror to king to Taliban, the
people of Afghanistan have forever suffered, forever been deprived,
forever kept ignorant, forever been hungry, forever been miserably
poor. Who has bothered to educate them in any sense of the word?

A look at the list of those who have held sway since 1747 shows how
easy it has been to take over, to depose, to usurp, to assassinate
or to murder:

Shahs of the Durrani dynasty: Ahmad Khan - assumed the title of
Shah and the epithet Durr-i-Durran (1747-73); Timur - son (1773-
93); Zaman Mirza - son (1793-deposed 1800); Mahmud 1st - brother
(1800-deposed 1803); Shuja-ul-Mulk 1st - brother (1803-deposed
1809); Mahmud 2nd (1809-18).

Anarchy and confusion (1818-26).

Amirs of the Barakzay dynasty: Dost Mohammed 1st - assumed the
title of Amir (1826 - abdicated 1838); Shuja-ul-Mulk - restored
(1838-42); Dost Mohammed - restored (1842 - killed May 1863); Sher
Ali Khan - son (May 1863 - deposed May 1866); Afzal Khan - brother
(May 1866 - Oct 1867); Azam Khan - brother (Oct 1867 - deposed
March 1868); Sher Ali Khan - restored (March 1868 - Feb 1879);
Yakub Khan - son Feb 1879 - abdicated Dec 1879); Musa Khan - son
(Dec 1879 - March 1880); Ayub Khan - uncle (March 1880 - Oct 1881);
Abdur Rahman - son of Afzal Khan (Oct 1881 - Oct 1901); Habibullah
Khan - son (Oct 1901 - assassinated Feb 1919); Nasrullah Khan -
brother (Feb 1919 deposed).

Shahs of Afghanistan: Amanullah Khan - son of Habibullah (Feb 1919
- abdicated Jan 1929); Inayatullah Khan - brother (Jan 1929
deposed); Habibullah Ghazi (Bacha Saqao) - usurper (Jan 1929 -
deposed and executed Oct 1929); Muhammad Nadir - great-grandnephew
of Dost Mohammad (1929 - assassinated 1933); Muhammad Zahir - son
(1933 - deposed 1973).

Presidents of the Republic of Afghanistan: Sardar Muhammad Daoud -
Zahir Shah's cousin (July 1973 - deposed and assassinated April
1978); Noor Muhammad Taraki (April 1978 - deposed and executed
September 1979); Hafizullah Amin (September 1979 - deposed and
assassinated December 1979); Babrak Karmal (December 1979 - deposed
May 1986); Muhammad Najibullah (May 1986 - deposed March 1992,
later hanged by the Taliban 1996); Sibgatullah Mujaddedi (March
1992 - deposed June 1992); Burhanuddin Rabbani (June 1992 - ).

Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan: Amirul Momineen Mulla Muhammad Omar
(1996 - ).

In this present round of warring in Afghanistan, who is fighting
whom and for what?

The emirate has an embassy in Islamabad, on Street 90, off Attaturk
Avenue, presided over by Ambassador Mulla Abdul Salam Zaeef, who is
assisted linguistically by his translator, Ahmed Ratib,
distinguished by the black patch he wears over one eye.

Street 90, since September 11, has been jam-packed with journalists
and cameramen of the world's press corps who hang around waiting
for news to break from minute to minute or for a statement from
Mulla Zaeef. Last Monday, I happened to be in Islamabad, staying in
the house next door to the embassy, and strolled over for one of
the almost daily press conferences. It was attended by some 150
journalists with 50-plus cameramen from countries stretching from
Canada and Japan to South Africa and the Antipodes.

Mulla Zaeef rebuffed reports that Osama bin Laden, supposedly still
in Afghanistan, is in possession of nuclear weapons, he confirmed
that US commandos had entered his country, he denied that any
foreigners had been killed in the air strikes, he was unaware of
any forthcoming ground invasion, he denied rumours of any split
among the Taliban, and he requested that all the jihadis of
Pakistan who wished to join in the tangled tussle wait to cross the
border until the ground battle begins. His statement and the few
questions and vague answers took about fifteen minutes.

At a cost accountant's estimate, taking the time spent by the 200-
odd waiting for the conference to get going, those fifteen minutes
were worth $ 12,000. A lot of money that could perhaps be better
spent, but such is the cost of news so eagerly awaited around the
world.

The consulate-general of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan in
Karachi is situated next to the Bagh-i-Rustom in Clifton. It is
well-staffed, with a consul-general, a first secretary-cum-vice-
consul, a second secretary and a commercial attache. Consul-General
Maulvi Rahmatullah Kakazada, now in his 35th year, is a native of
Ghazni, he can speak, write and read Pashto, Persian and Arabic,
and can understand English. He was manager of a freight forwarding
company from 1996 to 1998 and since then has been CG at Karachi. He
has only one wife who has presented him with four children.

First Secretary Vice Consul Mufti Muhammad Aleem is 28 years old, a
graduate of our Dar al-Ulum Haqqania at Akora Khattak where he
specialized in the study of fiqh, and is the proud holder of a
certificate which entitles him to call himself 'Mufti'. He is
proficient in Pashto and Persian, and can speak and understand some
Urdu. He also has only one wife and so far only one child.

Second Secretary Muhammad Daoud Shah Niazi, born in 1973, is from
the village of Niazi in Khost Paktia. He studied at a madrassah in
Kohat and then at Jamshoro from where he graduated in 1997.

Commercial Attache Gul Ahmad Hakimi was born in 1964 in Ghazni and
is a graduate of a madrassah at Quetta. Before being posted to
Karachi in 1996, he was the director-general of the secondary
education department of his country's ministry of education at
Kabul.

These seemingly fierce men, bearded and turbaned, are all amiable
people and they do have a sense of humour. To understand what they
want from life is difficult. They are convinced that the
demolishment of New York's Twin Towers and the attack on
Washington's Pentagon was achieved by the Israelis. They say the
Americans have no proof that Osama or his associates were involved.

They are, of course, imbued with religiosity. They have no fear of
death and are absolutely ready and willing to kill in the name of
their particular brand of religion. They were unable to tell me,
when I asked, what or who is a 'moderate' Taliban - this was beyond
them. They say the Taliban are not willing to be represented in a
'broad-based' government with the Northern Alliance and King Zahir
Shah and his men. "Where was Zahir Shah when the Afghans were being
massacred by the Russians?" they asked.

They are convinced that UN Special Representative Lakhdar Brahimi
is an American agent. When asked how they feel about their Foreign
Minister Ahmad Muttawakils suggestion that instead of bombing
Afghanistan, Bush and Blair settle the matter in a kalashnikov duel
with Mulla Omar, they said the Mulla is waiting!

They told me that shrapnel from the countless bombs dropped by the
Americans on Afghanistan is collected and sold as scrap in the
bazaars of Afghanistan and Peshawar for whatever it can fetch. So
at least someone is gaining some advantage from the bombardments.

They do not want war, they would far prefer peace. When asked then,
in that case, why do the Taliban not hand over Osama to Bush, they
say that, firstly, he is a Muslim and, secondly he has helped them
fight the Russians, and, thirdly, he is their guest.

As far as the men of the consulate-general are concerned, what is
known to us as terrorism is their manner of fighting a war. Their
concept is very much the same as that of Prince Hasan of Jordan
who, when introducing Tony Blair at the Al-Khoei Foundation
conference in North London last week, reportedly said that
terrorism stands to win by not losing; and the West stands to lose
by not winning.

<A NAME="whod">Who developed anthrax?</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Eric S. Margolis

As our world continues to spin out of control, two horrible events
last week had special resonance for me: the spreading anthrax
terror, and the death of my old Afghan comrade-in-arms, Abdul Haq.

First, anthrax. In late 1990, after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, I
was in Baghdad, covering the impending Gulf War. In a futile effort
to prevent threatened US air attacks, Saddam Hussein rounded up
foreigners and held them hostage in Baghdad hotels. This brutish
act - which provoked outrage around the world - was a typical
example of Saddam's uncanny knack for negative, self-defeating,
public relations.

Among the hostages, I discovered three British scientists who had
been employed at Iraq's top secret Salman Pak chemical and
biowarfare plant. Two of the Britons confided to me they had been
working to develop a weaponized form of anthrax for Iraq's army.

At the time, no one yet knew that Iraq was trying to use anthrax as
a weapon. My dispatches from Baghdad were the first indication that
Iraq had progressed beyond crude, World War I - style chemical
weapons. The Iraqis threatened to hang me as a spy.

What made this news so fascinating was: 1) the British scientists
told me they were part of a large technical team secretly organized
and 'seconded' to Iraq in the mid-1980s by the British government
and Secret Intelligence Service, MI6; 2) the feed stocks for all of
the germ weapons being developed by Iraq came from an American
laboratory in Maryland. Iraq received full approval from the US
government to buy anthrax, plague, botulism, and other pathogens.
Here is a prime case of what spooks call 'blowback.'

Why did Britain and the US covertly help Iraq to develop biological
weapons? When an Islamic revolution overthrew the US-backed Shah of
Iran in 1979, the US and Britain decided to overthrow the new
regime in Tehran, which was seen as a threat to their Mideast oil
interests. Washington and London urged Saddam Hussein to invade
Iran in 1980 and march on Tehran. US and British money, arms, and
military assistance flowed secretly to Baghdad.

But by 1983, Iraq was on the defensive and near to losing the war.
Iran, with nearly four times Iraq's population, was fighting back
ferociously, swamping Iraqi defences with human wave attacks. In
desperation, Iraq, America and Britain began a crash development
programme to produce chemical and biological weapons to break
Iran's attacks and offset its numerical superiority. Iraq's
chemical arsenal savaged Iran's infantry and helped Baghdad win the
war by 1988. Over 500,000 soldiers died in the conflict.

In the Anglo-American view, chemical and biological weapons were
fine - so long as they were used to kill or maim Iranian Muslims
who opposed western interests. Such monstrous weapons, it seems,
are only associated with terrorism when used against westerners. My
view: what goes around, comes around, as the old song goes.

Second, Abdul Haq. A leading mujihideen leader during the great
jihad, or holy struggle, of the 1980s against the Soviet occupation
of Afghanistan, Haq was a burly, colourful, intense man, one of the
most charismatic Pakhtoon leaders and a CIA favourite. I was with
Abdul Haq and his men both in Peshawar and inside Afghanistan. Haq,
and his brother, Haji Kadir, gave me the hospitality of their home
and their badly needed protection during the important battle for
Jalalabad.

When the Afghan communist regime offered $50,000 to Afridi
tribesmen around the Khyber Pass to capture me, two jeeploads of
Haq's warriors ensured I was not kidnapped and sent to be tortured
and executed in Kabul.

After September 11, CIA resumed contacts with its old ally Abdul
Haq that were broken off in 1989. When it became clear in recent
weeks that the Russian-created Northern Alliance would be unable to
take over Afghanistan from the Pakhtoon Taliban, CIA sought an
anti-Taliban Pakhtoon leader, and naturally called the renowned
Abdul Haq.

Last week, CIA sent Haq and a handful of supporters into
Afghanistan with bags of dollars to bribe Pakhtoon tribal leaders
away from the Taliban. Haq, who was headstrong and impulsive,
foolishly went along with CIA's hasty, poorly concocted scheme.

Like CIA's unbroken record of bloody fiascos in Iraq, this
amateurish venture also failed disastrously. Forewarned by
sympathizers in Peshawar, the Taliban surrounded Haq's party. Haq,
who had lost a foot to a Soviet mine, tried to flee on horseback.
CIA bungled an attempt to rescue him, though two of its agents with
Haq managed to escape on US helicopters. My old friend was captured
and summarily executed by the Taliban as a warning to any potential
defectors.

The life of one of the heroes of the great jihad against Soviet
oppression was thus thrown away in a botched, amateurish mission in
an unnecessary war. Another CIA 'expendable asset' had been
expended.

Ten days before his fatal mission, Abdul Haq had urged the US not
to bomb Afghanistan, warning that doing so would only rally Afghans
to the Taliban, inflict massive new suffering on an already
tortured nation, and plunge Afghanistan into disintegration and
chaos. No one in war-fevered Washington listened to Abdul Haq.-

<A NAME="waro">War on terror - my cow</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

Brute force bereft of reason falls by its own weight. Power with
counsel temper'd even the gods make greater; but might which in its
soul is bent on all impiety, they hate. -Horace

If this was a war on terror then it should have begun from Israel,
the dagger of terror planted in the heart of the Arab world and
held in place by help from the United States.

But since it is nothing of the kind and from New York's Twin
Towers, or rather their rubble, has leapfrogged straight to
Afghanistan - on a body of circumstantial evidence that would fail
to convince even a drinking judge of a county court - it becomes
valid to question America's strident, and increasingly tiresome,
rhetoric and the half-truths it is expecting the rest of the world
to swallow.

If this was a war on terror what about the US's own record in this
field?

What a shining list of scumbags the US has supported in Asia,
Africa and Latin America, all in the name of freedom and the fight
against communism. The Trujillos, Somozas and Batistas signified
the kind of ruler the US was happiest with. No matter how corrupt
and tyrannical, they were kosher, and high in American esteem, so
long as they played lackey to US interests. The word banana
republic comes from the Caribbean and denotes the kind of dependent
and compliant state the US favoured.

What was Fidel Castro's great crime? Cuba was no threat to the US.
The very idea is laughable. The US just could not tolerate a regime
90 miles off its coastline that had the temerity to stand up to it.
Havana was a playland and a brothel for America's rich. Castro put
an end to that and took Cuba out of the American orbit, an act of
audacity for which the US has never forgiven him. He wasn't even a
communist to begin with, but became one as a response to American
hostility.

What was the Bay of Pigs except an exercise in naked terror? It was
an invasion of Cuba by an army of Cuban exiles armed and funded by
the CIA. The Reagan administration broke American laws to provide
funds and arms to the Contra rebels (or terrorists) it helped put
up against the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.

This list can go on and on. The overthrow of Mosssadegh in Iran,
Lumumba's killing in the Congo, the brutalization and naked terror
practised by the US in Vietnam, the totally pointless war foisted
on Cambodia (from which that country has yet to recover), and
training and funding the same Arabs and Muslim fundamentalists in
Afghanistan during the eighties whom the US is now attempting to
destroy.

Those idealists who consider the US as the land of hope and liberty
should consider the US record in Latin America and the Third World
before getting wet-eyed on this score. Now we are witnessing
another exercise in muscle-flexing in the name of freedom - this
time Enduring Freedom. The irony surrounding this venture is
thicker than the bombs falling on Afghanistan.

Democracy and the rule of law at home should not be confused with
unprincipled conduct abroad. European colonialists abided by rules
at home which they discarded as soon as they left their shores. So
it has been always: one law for Rome, another for the barbarians
vanquished by Rome. So it is with the new imperium: a different
light shining from the Statue of Liberty, a different morality
beamed at the outside world.

After 50 years of supporting the politics of terrorism in the
Middle East, and of exporting CIA-led terror elsewhere across the
globe, the US is alight with uncontrolled indignation because the
unimaginable has occurred and it too has been struck by terrorism.

Like the Cyclops Polyphemus whose eye was taken out by Odysseus,
the US is going about like a wounded giant and will not be appeased
unless it has had its revenge. But revenge on whom? The trail
leading from the Twin Towers to bin Laden is unclear but has been
seized upon by the US because it is the only one available. And
because bin Laden and the Taliban are easy targets to demonize.

One does not have to be a Taliban supporter to point out the
iniquity of what the US is doing. At issue is not what the Taliban
stand for or what their attitude to women is but the death and
destruction raining down on the hapless people of Afghanistan.
Nothing in the world can justify this and those bleeding hearts who
underscore the retrogressive nature of the Taliban's policies are
only confusing the issue.

No such confusion exists in the minds of ordinary Pakistanis. They
may have no truck with the Taliban but they do not like the brutal
bombing of Afghanistan. They also do not like Pakistan's soil being
used as a launching pad for what is increasingly perceived as an
unholy war.

Is it not plain to see what is happening in Afghanistan? A
humanitarian catastrophe is looming on the horizon but the
'civilized world' whose way of life came under threat on September
11 views different objects through different spectacles.
Afghanistan is not part of the civilized world, or at least of none
that a US president who looks smaller than the cosmic role he is
trying to play would readily recognize. So it is all right to apply
different standards there.

The UN has been a US mistress since the Gulf War. So it is foolish
expecting comfort from that quarter. But even the UNHCR and its
risible chief, Luubers of the Netherlands, are playing politics
with the plight of the Afghans.

If the suffering is in Afghanistan, then the relief aid should go
there. But Luubers and his entourage think that that would somehow
work in the Taliban's favour. So instead of taking aid to the
refugees, they are asking Pakistan to open its borders, so that the
problem caused by American bombing adds to the refugee burden of
Pakistan. With friends like these, who needs enemies?

Even so, Pakistan's role is the strangest in this dance of death
over the skies of Afghanistan. Even if the doubtful proposition is
accepted that we had no choice except to bow to American wishes,
what necessity of circumstance or loss of shame drives us to be
more loyal than the king?

While standing by Donald Rumsfeld's side (at the press conference
both addressed in Islamabad), Pakistan's foreign minister Abdul
Sattar was not content to observe diplomatic niceties. He had to
outreach himself and say that never in human history was so much
care taken to avoid human casualties as the Americans were taking
in Afghanistan. The cadence of Churchillian rhetoric - 'never in
the field of human conflict...', etc, - employed to what dubious
purpose.

Remember also the haste with which Pakistan said that the evidence
provided by the US was enough to indict Osama bin Laden in a court
of law. The American bombing came after this bit of judicial
activism from Pakistan. Whom were we trying to satisfy? The world
or our own scruples?

In a similar category falls General Musharraf's assertion that the
Taliban's days were numbered. Granted that we have no freedom of
action. Or, rather, that we have seen to it that we are divested of
all freedom of action. Still, why must our behaviour exceed the
limits of necessity?

But, surely, an image that will linger long in the mind is that of
Pakistan's proud military chiefs standing in line with beaming
faces to greet Rumsfeld, while General Musharraf is seen laughing a
step or two behind. Necessity or weakness may be behind the
position we have taken in this crisis. But with the people of
Afghanistan being subjected to brutal aggression, what need, in
public at least, for such bonhomie? For form's sake, if nothing
else, we could be more guarded in our displays of affection when
American warlords come calling.

Now General Musharraf is on his way to New York to be feted by
President Bush on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session.
We can only keep our fingers crossed. It doesn't take much for a
Pakistani leader to be swept off his feet. A bit of extra cosseting
and someone who in his native setting looks every inch a stern
defender of the national interest is changed instantly into a plate
of pudding. It is the nation which ends up paying the bill for this
transformation.

<A NAME="enou">Enough is enough</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

Among the legacies of the Vietnam war was 'collateral damage', a
nasty, cold-blooded term meant to camouflage the reality of
civilian casualties behind its bland, bureaucratic facade.

In the so-called war against terror, the American pounding of
Afghanistan is inevitably spreading death and destruction among the
civilian population. And just as inevitably, collateral damage is
being inflicted on Pakistan as well: with each report of an errant
bomb or missile killing innocent men, women and children in
Afghanistan, the support for General Musharraf slips a little.
Another kind of collateral damage we are suffering from is the
steady inflow of Afghan refugees fleeing the carpet-bombing of
their battered nation.

Indeed, if the aid agencies had their way, this inflow would turn
into a flood. From Oxfam to the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees, they are all demanding that Pakistan open its borders
to the unfortunate Afghans who are desperate for food, shelter and
medical assistance at our doorsteps. All these well-intentioned
relief agency officials want to avert a looming humanitarian
disaster as winter approaches, food stocks in Afghanistan run low
and American bombing makes distribution of supplies impossible.

At the risk of sounding hard-hearted and callous, may I suggest
that those demanding that Pakistan allow these poor Afghans in
should seriously consider flying them to their own countries and
caring for them there. I make this suggestion in all seriousness.
As the country with the biggest population of refugees in the world
already on its soil, Pakistan is now being asked to take possibly
millions more. And yet, a boatload of Afghans seeking to reach
Australia is refused entry and causes a major incident.

Somehow this entire arm-twisting exercise reeks of hypocrisy. We
already have anywhere between two and three million Afghans living
here, courtesy the Soviet invasion and the subsequent civil war
there. Hundreds of thousands of these were born in Pakistan, have
never been to Afghanistan, and possibly never will. Their fathers
and brothers have been engaged in all manner of trade and
professions, ranging from transport and mining to gun-running and
drug smuggling. Their presence has placed a huge burden on the
environment and the government exchequer.Despite all this, bleeding
hearts across the world want us to take in another couple of
millions. I would suggest they put their land where their mouth is
and offer the Afghans the hospitality they want us to provide.
Sure, they are offering to put up the refugee camps and pay for the
food and the medicine for now. But what happens when the current
campaign in Afghanistan ends and the glare of the media shifts to
whatever fresh target the Pentagon has in its sights? This happened
when the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan a decade ago, and most
of the three million refugees sensibly refused to return to a
country where a civil war produced more carnage in Kabul than the
Soviets did.

This time it is American bombs that are producing the fear and
uncertainty, driving more and more Afghans towards our borders. In
both cases, we ended up as the victims of geography and the agendas
of superpowers that were too far away to have to bear the full
consequence of their actions. And although in both instances, there
are initially an inflow of aid to cope with the situation, donor
fatigue soon set in during the late nineties, with the result that
Pakistan's weak economy was left to bear the burden. There is no
guarantee that this will not happen again.

But more than the money required for the upkeep of the refugees,
there are other kinds of price. Firstly, the devastation caused to
the environment of the Frontier province is long-term as a result
of trees chopped down for fuel. During Zia's days, police were not
allowed to apply the laws of the land to our Afghan population.
Then they have entered a range of professions and trades, depriving
locals of employment opportunities since they are willing to work
for lower wages.

It is estimated that 50,000 Afghans are working in Quetta alone.
Their involvement in crimes of all kinds is aggravating an already
grim law and order situation. And their presence in large numbers
provides the foot soldiers for the extremist religious groups and
the jihadi outfits that have virtually established a state within a
state. In fact, many of the bearded faces seen on BBC and CNN
belong to Afghans who have settled in major cities from Karachi to
Islamabad.

Given all these hidden as well as quantifiable costs of playing
host to the existing population of refugees, it is amazing that the
aid community is now applying pressure on Pakistan to accept yet
more Afghans. They are trying to reassure us by saying that the
camps would be located in 'remote' parts of the country. But we
know only too well that many Afghans do not stay where they are
supposed to. Indeed, an unknown number of them have Pakistani
identity cards and avail themselves of the educational and medical
facilities intended for Pakistani citizens. Thousands have also got
Pakistani passports.

When the first flood of our neighbours arrived in the eighties,
there was much official talk of 'welcoming our Afghan brethren.' No
longer. Even their Pakistani Pashtun cousins and tribesmen are fed
up. Although they may be demonstrating against American bombing,
they would not like the present influx of refugees to stay on as
the previous one did.

When a few thousand asylum-seekers are admitted to Britain and do
not return, there is loud and angry criticism of the government.
The other Europeans are very tough with their illegal immigrants,
fearing an erosion of their cultural values. The Americans do their
best to halt the flow of economic refugees who risk their lives and
pay fortunes to unscrupulous agents. The Australians are willing to
let shiploads of asylum seekers sink rather than allow them to land
on their under-populated shores. And yet we are being pressed to
take in millions of more Afghans over and above the two million-
plus who are already here.

"Let the polluter pay" is an established principle in determining
who pays to clean up after an environmental disaster. Here, I would
suggest we amend this to read: "Let the bomber pay." Having joined
the American-led coalition, we should not be penalized by having an
additional burden imposed on us. At some point, we have to say
enough is enough, and that point has been reached.

<A NAME="pias">PIA sacks sporting legends</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 7: Country's sporting legends Jahangir Khan, Jansher
Khan and Zaheer Abbas were officially handed over retirement
letters by the national carrier Pakistan International Airlines
(PIA).

The attitude of the establishment to the legends, who have been
decorated with Pride of Performance awards, didn't end here. At
least Jahangir Khan was told that he had only two days to remove
his belongings from his office.

There were reports that the PIA was planning to shut down the
sports complex which, ironically, has been named after Jahangir.
The complex is the hub of budding youngsters activities who sharpen
their skills under the nose of Jahangir.

The legendary trio has been asked to clear their dues and go home
with two months advanced salary. The sudden change in PIA's
attitude rings alarm bells for hundreds of sportsmen as the
national carrier had been the biggest promoter and supporter of the
sportsmen..

The debatable decision springs uncertainty amongst other PIA
sportsmen who are presently appointed on contractual basis.

Zaheer is a former Pakistan captain and was as run-scoring machine
during his playing days. Jansher won the British Open six time and
eight World Opens. But Jahangir is head and shoulders above
everyone. Undoubtedly the greatest sportsman of the country, he has
won a record 10 British Open titles, six World Open titles and
remained unbeatable for little under six years.

Jahangir is probably the only sportsman in whose honour Pakistan
government released stamps which his picture on it.

"Of course I am heart-broken. After having given my everything to
the country and to PIA, I don't deserve this treatment," Jahangir
said. "My pride and dignity has been hurt. Looking back at my
career, I today regret why I rejected lucrative offers to settle
down abroad. Today I am having a feeling that I don't belong to
this system and culture," the humble Jahangir said.

Jahangir, Jansher and Zaheer are Pakistan's pride and honour. They
are country's hero who have raised the green flag wherever they
played. And after doing wonders throughout their careers, if this
is the treatment they deserve, well, then its better that sports
should be banned in the country.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI Nov 5: Squash legends Jahangir Khan, Jansher Khan and
former cricket captain Zaheer Abbas - were among the nine officials
whose names have been struck off from the payrolls of Pakistan
International Airlines (PIA), sources said.

PIA has decided to end the services of nine employees as per rules
which allow for sending on retirement any employee with over 20
years of service or over 58 years of age.

Sources said the PIA Board of Directors had entrusted the airline
chief Ahmed Saeed with powers to enforce this rule in a meeting
held earlier this year.

Jahangir when contacted by SADA, showed ignorance over this
development. "I am not in knowledge of this," he said. The former
world champion working for the airline since 1978, is currently
general manager PIA's sports division, while Jansher and Zaheer are
also working on the same post.

The sources denied reports that the airline's sports wing is
teetering on the borders of closure. "PIA has already slashed its
sports budget and many sportsmen are working in administration and
other departments, but shutting down PIA sports is not on the
cards," the sources added.

Two former managing directors - Nawaz Tiwana and Shahid Islam - are
also among the nine officials sent for retirement.

Apart from cricketers, PIA also has star hockey players in its
sports division, including Shahbaz Ahmad, Atif Bashir, Mohammad
Usman, Shahid Ali Khan and Ahmad Alam etc. Shahbaz, Atif and Usman
are still the part of the national team, while the remaining two
former Pakistan goalkeepers have retired.-SADA

<A NAME="shar">Sharjah not my destiny, says Waqar</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 9: Pakistan captain Waqar Younis said he was delighted
with his team's success in Sharjah but clarified that was not his
destiny.

"I am not taking away any credit from my boys who were excellent.
But it is not what we are looking for. Our target is World Cup and
that's what we are gunning for," the skipper said from Lahore.

Waqar admitted that the victory has done good to the team. "It has
lifted our spirits, our morale and most importantly helped us
regain the confidence of our supporters. We also managed to break
the jinx of choking in the finals. But our feet are still on the
ground as we are aware that tougher tasks lie ahead.

"For me, Sharjah is history now. I am looking forward to the home
series' against the West Indies, Australia and away tour to South
Africa. In between, I would like to pick every success because it
is essential to keep the team motivated and fired-up," Waqar said.

Waqar said the secret to success in Sharjah was team spirit,
cohesion and support each player gave to his teammate.

<A NAME="hock">Hockey: Pakistan draw with Netherlands</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ROTTERDAM, Nov 3: Pakistan drew 1-1 against Olympic champion and
Grand Slam holder the Netherlands in the men's Champions Trophy
field hockey tournament.

Pakistan team manager Khalid Sajjed Khokhar said he was satisfied
with the result. "I'm quite content that we are equal to Holland,"
he said. The match was a special one for Pakistan, featuring the
return of one of its finest players ever. Starting in the line up,
Shahbaz Ahmed returned to the field after retiring from
international play three years ago.

In the first half, Shabaz impressed with a few keen passes, but
minutes before halftime he failed to score before open goal.

"I can still improve a lot," the 35-year-old Ahmed said. "I can do
more for my team. And I hope I will do that in the coming matches."
With a smile on his face, Shahbaz said goalkeeper Qasim deserved
"today's prize money," as he stopped a rash of Dutch attacks.

Qasim conceded only one goal. After nine minutes of play, Taeke
Taekema opened the scoring out of a penalty corner. About 20
minutes later, Pakistan's Sohail Abbas scored the last goal of the
match.

GERMANY BEAT AUSTRALIA: Germany came from behind to beat Australia
2-1 in the last match. It was Germany's fourth successive victory
over the Olympic bronze medallists. -Agencies

<A NAME="doub">Double joy for Waqar</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SHARJAH, Nov 4: Pace trio Wasim Akram, Shoaib Akhtar and Waqar
Younis shared eight wickets as Pakistan took the Khaleej Times
Trophy with a five-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the final.

Pakistan dismissed Sri Lanka for 173 in 44.2 of their 50 overs.

Captain Waqar captured three for 31, Shoaib took three for 33 and
Wasim finished with two for 20. Pakistan survived a testing 10-over
spell from off-spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who snapped up three
for 22, as they eased to success at 177 for five in 43.4 overs.

Waqar received the crystal trophy and a prize of $120,000 as well
as being adjudged Man-of-the-Match while Sri Lanka were awarded
$80,000. Zimbabwe, who lost all four of their round-robin matches,
returned home with a cheque for $50,000.

Sri Lanka, who were seeking to complete a hat-trick of titles at
Sharjah, won the toss but were let down by their premier batsmen as
they played loosely at deliveries leaving them. After slipping to
21 for two, skipper Sanath Jayasuriya and Mahela Jayawardena shared
a stand 58 for the third wicket, but rash strokes undid all their
hard work.

Jayasuriya, who was shaping well, smashed five fours in his 58-ball
34 before slashing at a delivery from leg-spinner Shahid Afridi to
be caught behind. Jayawardena, who hit Shoaib Akhtar for a six,
fell in the same over, cutting a delivery way outside the off-stump
straight to wicket-keeper Rashid Latif after making 43 off 60
balls, with seven fours and one six.

Russel Arnold and Chamara Silva added 40 for the sixth wicket
before Wasim trapped Arnold leg before for 47 off 51 balls, with
four fours.

The Sri Lanka innings folded with the dismissal of Arnold, the last
five wickets tumbling for 21.

Pakistan, facing a modest target, raced to 73 for two by the 15th
over with the dashing Afridi setting the tone with 35 off 38 balls
before falling to Muralitharan.

Yousuf Youhana (40) and Inzamam-ul-Haq (28) put on 49 for the third
wicket, and after they went and Younis Khan fell cheaply, Abdur
Razzaq (14 not out) and Rashid Latif (23 not out) completed the
task in 43.4 overs.-Reuters

<A NAME="aust">Australia outclass Pakistan 3-1</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ROTTERDAM, Nov 6: Two smartly taken goals by Jeremy Hiskins, a
player dropped by Australia for the Sydney Olympics, gave his
country a 3-1 victory over Pakistan in the first match on the third
day of the Champions Trophy. Australia's second successive win took
them into second place behind Germany.

The game only came to life in the second-half after a lacklustre
scoreless first 35 minutes with Hiskins putting Australia into a 2-
0 lead with two good goals. His first came from Australia's first
corner in the 42nd minute following an intricate move, though he
did well to steer it home with a reverse stick shot after the final
pass went slightly behind him. However Pakistan came back strongly
and had three good chances to level but Kashif Jawwad, who scored
both goals in Pakistan's 2-0 win over Korea, missed two of them.

Pakistan were still pressing when defender Bevan George picked out
Hiskins with a 50 yard pass and Hiskins' neat deflection put his
side 2-0 ahead.

Pakistan continued to create chances but it was not until the 66th
minute that Sohail Abbas flicked in their goal from his side's
third corner. Pakistan desperately sought a late equaliser but it
was Adam Commens who stole the last goal for Australia, hammering
in a cross circle pass.

Pakistan's legend Shahbaz Ahmad admitted afterwards that they were
lacking cohesion among their forward line. "Pakistan's attack at
the moment lacks the combinations enjoyed by other teams".-AFP

<A NAME="pcbn">PCB not cooperating, says Malik's lawyer</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Nov 6: Former Pakistan captain Salim Malik's lawyer
accused Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) of non-cooperation and
creating hurdles in the way of filing of his client's appeal
against the life ban.

"No one supported Malik after he was unjustifiably banned from
cricket. Now the Pakistan Cricket Board is causing hurdles and has
not given us the related documents needed to file a Civil
Revision," Raja Jahanzeb Akhtar told SADA. "The Civil Revision
against the ban will be filed next week before Lahore High Court
judge Justice Karamat Bhandari."

Middle-order batsman Malik, 38, was banned for life on match-fixing
charges by a judicial commission in May last year. Lahore High
Court judge Malik Mohammad Qayyum, who has resigned from the post,
conducted the inquiry from Sept 1998 to Oct 1999.

"There seems no justification in banning Malik because the inquiry
was conducted by Justice Qayyum and not by the Lahore High Court
itself. An inquiry cannot punish anybody," he said. "Cricket is his
(Malik's) life and the decision has really made things worse for my
client," he said.

Although Malik was granted a stay against the ban by a civil court
in Lahore in November last year, PCB instructed his employer Habib
Bank Limited not to include him in their team for domestic
competitions. "Pakistan has a good record under his captaincy and
he should not have been treated like this without any proper
evidence," Jahanzeb said.

Match-fixing allegations were first levelled against Malik by
Australian players Shane Warne, Mark Waugh and Tim May who accused
the former Pakistan captain of offering them bribe to perform
poorly in a Test in Karachi in 1994.

"PCB has snatched cricket bat from Malik and that too without
giving him any chance of appeal," Malik's lawyer said. "PCB has
spoiled Malik's reputation who is a very simple man." -SADA

<A NAME="shoa">Shoaib reported again</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, Nov 7: Shoaib Akhtar has been again reported for a suspect
action during the recent Sharjah Champions Trophy tournament, the
International Cricket Council (ICC) said.

The report was filed to the game's governing body by South African
match referee Denis Lindsay and umpires Rudi Koertzen of South
Africa and George Sharp of England.

Pakistan won the Sharjah tournament with a five-wicket win over Sri
Lanka in the final, a match in which 26-year-old Shoaib took three
for 33.

Shoaib, nicknamed the Rawalpindi Express and among the fastest
bowlers in the world, must now work with a specialist ICC bowling
advisor to analyse the concerns raised.

The ICC said they would name the advisor imminently, and that an
assessment of Shoaib's action would be submitted to the ICC and the
Pakistan Cricket Board within three months. During this period
Shoaib can continue to play international cricket, the ICC said.

A Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesman said Shoaib would be
provided with full support to get his action cleared again. "We
will decide in the next few days to appoint someone to work further
with him on his action," the spokesman said. "That is until he (is
cleared)."-Reuters/AFP

<A NAME="pcbt">PCB takes ICC head-on</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 9: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) took the
International Cricket Council (ICC) head-on when it rejected the
appointment of a specialist bowling adviser for Shoaib Akhtar.

The PCB, known for going all the way in defence of its players,
further said it would provide complete legal assistance to Shoaib
if a stage came when he was banned by the ICC and decided to
challenge his suspension in a court of law. "It is unfortunate that
this stage came which should have been avoided particularly after
Shoaib was twice cleared by the ICC. We will dispatch our
reservations and protest to the ICC on the subject Saturday,"
chairman of the PCB Lt Gen Tauqir Zia said.

The ICC Thursday appointed former West Indian fast bowler Michael
Holding to help Shoaib. The two will work for three months to
analyze concerns raised by South African match referee Denis
Lindsay during the recent Sharjah Cup and undergo any recommended
remodeling of his action.

The progress report has to be submitted by Feb 7 to the ICC and the
PCB. Shoaib, in the meantime, can continue to play in this period.
However, if the pacer is reported again, he would be banned for a
year. But the PCB supremo further said his establishment was not in
a position to bear the expenses of Holding's three-month
assignment.

"The ICC will also be informed that we cannot host Michael
(Holding) for such a long period. But the West Indian is more than
welcome in this part of the world anytime for we all have highest
regards for him and acknowledge his contributions to the game of
cricket," Tauqir said.

The cash-strapped PCB are facing financial crisis after it was
denied the right to earn approximately $30million owing to
cancellation of Indian and New Zealand tours this year for various
reasons.

<A NAME="boar">Board wages cola war over contracts</A>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 9: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) triggered a cola
war when it said that its players have revoked their contracts with
Coca-Cola and have signed up with Pepsi.

"The current players have revoked their contracts with Coca-Cola
and barring Yousuf Youhana and Saqlain Mushtaq who are playing in
Karachi, the rest have signed up with Pepsi. The two will sign
fresh contracts by next week," a PCB official said.

The official further said the PCB was ready to face legal challenge
if the players were dragged in the court of law. "Whether the suit
is of millions or trillions, the PCB is ready to provide all the
legal cover to its players. The board has gone through the
contracts and have found out that it is a one-sided one and
inadmissible in any court," the official said.

Eight Pakistan players - Waqar Younis, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Saeed Anwar,
Yousuf Youhana, Mushtaq Ahmad, Saqlain Mushtaq, Moin Khan and Azhar
Mahmood - signed a two-year contract with Coca-Cola through their
agents Sports Unlimited.

According to the contracts, which were to run between Jan 1, 2001
to Dec 31, 2002, the players were to make themselves available for
products publicity campaigns. But the PCB got involved in the issue
after their interests clashed with the players deal. The PCB has an
annual $4.6million contract with Coca-Cola's rivals Pepsi.

The PCB official said Coca-Cola have clarified that they have got
nothing to do with the PCB or the players. "They have signed the
players through Sports Unlimited and therefore, if they filed a
suit, it would be against the players agent (Sports Unlimited).

"The PCB enjoys excellent relationship with Coca-Cola and really
appreciate their efforts to release our share of 75 per cent from
the 1999 Asian Test Championship which was in limbo because of the
follies of the PCB. "Another 20 per cent could have been released
had the tri- series in Sharjah between 'A' teams from Pakistan, Sri
Lanka and India gone ahead as per schedule."

The PCB spokesman clarified that the establishment was supportive
of players contracts with multi-national companies but emphasised
that it had informed the players and their agent that before
entering into any agreement, prior permission from the PCB was
necessary. "That procedure was not followed as the players directly
got into contracts. When Sports Unlimited was inquired, it said it
had signed the players with Coca-Cola after the cricketers
confirmed their availability and conveyed that they had taken
permission from the board."

The PCB spokesman said Coca-Cola have been advised to stop payments
from October. The eight players were to get final installment of
their lucrative contracts along with bonus'. "The players new
contract with Pepsi is even more attractive and they will earn more
than what they would have got from the revoked contract."

The spokesman said Sports Unlimited had informed the PCB not to ask
the players to revoke contracts but create a situation where Coca-
Cola would have been forced to cancel the contracts.

"We were advised not to allow players until October next year which
would have automatically resulted in cancellation of contracts by
Coca-Cola and thus, the legal battle would have been avoided. "But
we don't want any hanky panky. The contracts stand cancelled and we
are ready to face any legal battle."
