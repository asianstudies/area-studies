<a name="date">Date for New York meeting finalized</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Aug 31: Pakistan said that the date for meeting between
President Musharraf and Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
in New York had almost been finalized. "Dates have almost been
finalized, but these will be announced simultaneously by Islamabad
and New Delhi later," Foreign Office spokesman Riaz Mohammed Khan
said here at a press briefing.

When asked whether the officials of two countries would meet before
the summit-level meeting, he said no meeting of high officials was
on the cards prior to the summit meeting.

The spokesman said there was an agreement between the two sides in
principle that President Musharraf and Prime Minister Vajpayee
would meet in New York.

"Normally there is no fixed agenda for such meetings," he said,
adding that official statement emanating from New Delhi had
indicated that India wanted to pick up the threads from Agra
Summit.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

MUZAFFARABAD, Aug 31: AJK Prime Minister Sardar Sikandar Hayat Khan
asked the United Nations to increase the number of its military
observers along the Line of Control to effectively monitor blatant
ceasefire violations by the Indian army.

In his speech at a public meeting and later in a brief chat with
reporters, he also called upon the international community to
intervene and stop ruthless shelling by the Indian troops on
civilians in Azad Kashmir.

Indian forces resorted to intense shelling on villages in Kotli
district's Nakyal sector on Thursday, injuring 12 people, including
four women. " The shelling was unprecedented in recent history. I
do not understand the reason behind the sudden escalation in
shelling, particularly when Pakistan is exercising maximum
restraint along the LoC," Mr Khan said, adding that artillery
shells had hit even the office of the United Nations Military
Observers Group in the Nakyal area.

<a name="cehi">CE hints at giving assembly status to Northern Areas Council</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
GILGIT, Aug 30: In a move aimed at removing sense of deprivation
among the people of Northern Areas, President Gen Pervez Musharraf
indicated that the Northern Areas Legislative Council might be
given status of an assembly.

President Musharraf said funds would be provided from Khushal
Pakistan Programme for the development projects of Northern Areas.

The president said that Pakistan would continue its moral,
diplomatic and political support to Kashmiris till the resolution
of Kashmir issue in accordance with the wishes of the Kashmiri
people.

He said Pakistan had a firm belief that without solving the Kashmir
issue peace could not be achieved in the region. "The centrality of
Kashmir issue cannot be denied and we will keep on emphasizing the
point. Kashmiris also cannot be ignored in the process. We have to
seek their opinion at some stage," the president said.-PPI/APP

GILGIT, Aug 29: President Gen Pervez Musharraf said that Pakistan
wanted to solve the Kashmir issue in accordance with the wishes of
the Kashmiri people.

Addressing the Frontier Constabulary troops here, he said Pakistan
would continue to support the Kashmir cause as it was based on
justice and fair play.

The president said the primary task of the armed forces was to
defend Pakistan from any external threat. However, we should not
ignore the fact that the government had assigned the mission to
them to defend it against internal threats as well. "Whenever there
is any threat to Pakistan, the armed forces will always be there to
defend it bravely," he declared.

Staff Correspondent

MUZAFFARABAD, Aug 27: President Gen Pervez Musharraf said he would
meet Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in New York next
month, as Pakistan had received indications that the Indian premier
wanted to see him on the sidelines of the United Nations General
Assembly session.

"There are indications from across the border that Mr Vajpayee
would like to see me. There are some protocol matters. They
(Indians) expect I should invite him. I don't believe in protocol,
nor do I have any ego. I will invite him because I want to have a
meeting with him," the president said while addressing the joint
sitting of the AJK Legislative Assembly and the AJK Council.

The president said there were bigger issues involved in the meeting
(with Indian prime minister) and he did not want them to be left
behind because of petty issues like who would invite and who would
not.

He said Pakistan had also invited Mr Vajpayee and External Affairs
Minister Jaswant Singh to visit Islamabad and it was expected that
they would visit Pakistan, though the dates had not been fixed yet.
"But I want to make it clear that whether talks are held in New
York, Agra or Islamabad, without settlement of the Kashmir issue
Pakistan and India cannot make any progress in any area."

This would be my main focus, he said, and added that the signals
from India suggesting that he (Musharraf) was "rigid and unifocal"
were incorrect. "I have never said that I do not want to discuss
any other issue. We are prepared to discuss everything, but Kashmir
will remain priority," he declared expressing the hope that "good
sense would prevail across the border."

Gen Pervez Musharraf said Pakistan and India could not achieve
peace and progress without resolving Kashmir issue in accordance
with the aspirations of the Kashmiris. "You cannot reach any
solution on Kashmir without the involvement of the Kashmiris," he
said amid desk thumping.

Recalling the Agra summit, the president said: "We went there with
good intentions." He said he did not take with him ministers for
commerce or communications so that he could tell the Indians that
he wanted to discuss political issues and not commerce, trade, and
cultural exchanges.

The president said he and Mr Vajpayee had reached an "agreed joint
declaration" in Agra on July 16, but the Indians rejected it at the
last minute due to their internal differences. "They would be in
the know of its reason, but I felt sad that in spite of agreeing to
a joint declaration we could not sign it."

"I definitely asked Mr Vajpayee that what he wants to do next and
how should they proceed now and has this process come to an end? To
this he replied that the process should continue and he (Vajpayee)
would try his best in this regard," said the president.

He said there was a lot of support in Indian media and public that
Islamabad and Delhi should resolve Kashmir issue through dialogue.
"I am hopeful that talks will be held. But first we will seek
acceptance of Kashmir as a dispute. Once this is done, then in the
next step we will discuss how to resolve the issue," he said and
added that discussion on the solutions at this stage could create
complexities.

Referring to the situation in held Kashmir, the president condemned
the grant of special powers to Indian army and withdrawal of cases
against the personnel of paramilitary forces involved in human
rights violations, and said it was against all international norms.

"Punitive military actions and human rights violations in held
Kashmir are on the rise as New Delhi is applying more military
pressure against the innocent citizens in Kashmir," he said.

He reiterated Pakistan's diplomatic, moral and political support to
the people of Kashmir struggling for their just cause.

The president said he needed the cooperation of the nation to carry
forward the issue of Kashmir in the interest of the Kashmiris and
Pakistan. "I must say your support encourages, reinforces and
strengthens me when I talk to Indian leadership," he said.

<a name="vajp">Vajpayee, Musharraf to meet in New York</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring desk

LUCKNOW, Aug 26: Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said he
would meet President Pervez Musharraf during his New York visit
next month and discuss Jammu and Kashmir and other bilateral
issues.

The prime minister said that he had accepted an official invitation
to visit Pakistan and only dates were to be finalized for the
visit. "Of course the Jammu and Kashmir issue will be taken up and,
besides, I would like to improve economic understanding between the
two countries," Mr Vajpayee said in reply to queries on his agenda
for the possible talks in the US.

The meeting in New York would take place on the sidelines of the
United Nations General Assembly.

Mr Vajpayee welcomed Pakistan government's crackdown on Jihadi
elements, claiming he had asked Gen Musharraf during the Agra
summit that these elements could prove counter-productive for
Islamabad. He, however, hastened to add that it was an internal
matter of Pakistan.

Invitation: President Musharraf has sent a formal invitation to
Prime Minister Vajpayee for talks in New York next month, a
Pakistan government spokesman told AFP in Islamabad. "The
invitation was delivered to Mr Vajpayee through the Pakistan High
Commission in New Delhi on Saturday," the spokesman said.

<a name="aphc">APHC will involve itself in peace process: Bhat</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SRINAGAR, Aug 26: The All Parties Hurriyat Conference has said if a
headway is made in the proposed meeting between Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee and Pakistan's President Gen Pervez Musharraf at
New York, then the alliance will try to involve itself in the
process of finding the solution to the Kashmir issue.

The APHC Chairman, Prof Abdul Gani Bhat, however, ruled out any
sort of dialogue with New Delhi in immediate future. He said the
alliance had shot-off two letters to the leaders of the two
countries before Agra summit as a goodwill gesture.  But only
Islamabad responded and the Hurriyat delegation met Gen Musharraf
in Delhi.

"We have had a long wait for the response from New Delhi. And we
feel that further wait is meaningless. These developments do not
favour a dialogue with New Delhi in near future," Kashmir Times
quoted him as saying.

"Should a Vajpayee-Musharraf meet take place in New York, and
should that meeting make headway with regard to Kashmir, the All
Parties Hurriyat Conference will try to link itself with the
process of talks," the APHC chairman said. "The APHC will not
hesitate to play its role if the process of talks between India and
Pakistan takes off."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Aug 27: The economic and military sanctions imposed by
the United States on India in 1998 following its nuclear tests
could be removed as early as next month by the US Congress before
President Bush's meeting with the Indian Prime Minister on the
sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly session.

According to a report in the New York Times, the Bush
administration would also seek to remove the sanctions imposed on
Pakistan in 1998 because of its nuclear tests but economic
sanctions, including those imposed after General Musharraf's
takeover, would remain in place.

WASHINGTON, Aug 27: Pakistan is a friend of long-standing that is
an important Islamic and regional power, and the United States'
evolving relationship with India is not directed at any other
country.

This was stated by State Department spokesman Richard Boucher at
his press briefing on Monday in reply to questions about reports
relating to the lifting of US sanctions against India, reports
which also implied that there might not be similar or matching
movement where sanctions against Pakistan were concerned.

Mr Boucher said the US policy on South Asia sanctions was being
reviewed, and no decisions had been made. He also pointed out that
the US was committed to working with Pakistan, which was facing a
series of difficult political and social challenges.

<a name="reli">Religio-political parties reject UN monitors</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ahmed Hassan

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: A national conference of almost all religious
and political parties here rejected the UN monitors deployment
plan, describing it as "an act of discrimination and aggression"
against Afghanistan and vowed to jointly resist what it termed the
world body's "coercive measure."

The conference, organised and presided over by its convener Maulana
Samiul Haq, was attended, among others, by Nawabzada Nasrullah
Khan, chief of ARD, Raja Zafarul Haq and Javed Hashmi of PML-N,
Ijazul Haq of PML-LM, Liaqat Baloch of JI, Afaq Ahmed of MQM (H),
Gen Hameed Gul, Maulana Masood Azhar, Malik Faridullah of Millat
Party, Haji Mohammad Adeel of ANP, Maulana Azam Tariq of SSP,
Maulana Moeenuddin Lakhvi JAH, with representation of JUI (F),
Lashkar Tayeba, Harkat Al-Jehad, Afghan ambassador Mullah Abdul
Salam Zaeef and other smaller organisations.

While there was no representation of PPP, Maulana Fazlur Rahman,
Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Maulana Shah Ahmed Noorani were conspicuous
by their absence at the convention as their deputies represented
them.

A declaration adopted at the conference, criticised UN attitude
which pursued the resolutions against Afghanistan vigorously but
ignored their implementation when the issue of Palestine and
Kashmir arose.

The moot expressed the view that the real objective of the
deployment plan was other than the declared one, with monitors
likely to be assigned the duty of watching sensitive nuclear
installations of Pakistan.

The conference demanded of the government to reject the UNSC step
outright. It demanded of the UN to shun arbitrary actions and
recognise the Taliban government. It also urged the OIC to
recognise Taliban Islamic government and assist in the
reconstruction of Afghanistan. It appealed to the neighbouring big
powers of Russia and China to take a realistic view of Taliban
government and to play their role in foiling the international
conspiracies in the region.

Describing the defence of Afghanistan and Pakistan as a joint
responsibility, the moot declared that the people of Pakistan will
stand shoulder to shoulder with their tribal brethren in resisting
the UN move. The gathering rejected the government's crackdown on
'Jihadi' organisations outright, describing it as negating the
spirit of Jihad and violating the declaration in the Constitution
that Allah Almighty was the real ruler of earth.

The leaders vowed to work together for the larger interest of the
country's solidarity. They said that if the deployment of UN
monitors was not resisted, more serious problems could emerge.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 29: The government warned illegal immigrants not to
apply for computerized national identity cards (CNIC) and said
those attesting their documents would be severely punished.

A senior official of the National Database and Registration
Authority (Nadra) told newsmen that attestation of fake documents
was an offence under the Nadra Ordinance, 2000, entailing severe
punishment.

According to an estimate, there exist around 10 million phoney
identity cards in the country.

It was very difficult to detect fake ID cards, he said, and added
all old identity cards would be cancelled in December and the new
cards would be very difficult to imitate owing to various security
safeguards provided in them.

He advised the attesting authorities to ascertain the identity of
the applicants and only verify forms of Pakistani nationals and
genuine documents. "Wrong attestation is bound to be detected," he
added.-APP

<a name="form">NADRA forms can be rejected at Islamabad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 28: Application forms being submitted by people to get
computerized national identity cards (CNIC) and being accepted at
local offices, can be rejected at the head office of the National
Database Registration Authority in Islamabad, Dawn learnt on
Tuesday.

Sources at the provincial headquarters of NADRA said forms were
being received at district registration offices, NADRA's provincial
headquarters and at makeshift counters in various places in the
city. Forms were not being checked thoroughly due to paucity of
time. However, attestation, thumb impression etc were being checked
at a glance. This did not guarantee that those who had submitted
their forms would get computerized ID cards.

They said the application forms would be sent to Islamabad for
preparation of CNICs where they would be thoroughly checked and
scanned in the computer. The probability of rejection of a number
of forms at Islamabad could not be ruled out.

They maintained that the rejected forms would be returned at the
present address of an applicant along with the marking of objection
(s). It would be the applicant's responsibility to remove the
objection (s), fill in a new form, meet all formalities and
requirements and then resubmit the form.

The sources, however, declined to state the procedure of
resubmitting of forms saying they had not yet received any
instructions in this regard from Islamabad "because such a
situation has not arisen so far."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Aug 27: Pakistan Muslim League (N) decided that none of
its leaders would meet President Pervez Musharraf either on behalf
of the party or in his individual capacity, and made it clear that
any interim setup under his leadership would not be acceptable to
the party.

The decision was made at a special meeting of the central leaders
of the party held at the residence of Begum Kulsoom Nawaz Sharif
and presided over by Chairman PML-N Raja Zafarul Haq.

Talking to reporters after the meeting, Acting President of PML (N)
Javed Hashmi said the meeting dilated on the political changes in
the country to devise a future political strategy.

Terming the present government illegal and unconstitutional, he
said no party member was allowed to meet Gen Pervez Musharraf in
his personal capacity.

To a question, he said the PML would not be a part of any setup
announced by Gen Musharraf.

Mr Hashmi further said the meeting refused to accept any plan to
amend the Constitution and the setting up of National Security
Council. He said the roadmap for democracy was pre-poll rigging
therefore it was also not acceptable to the party.

Dawn Panel

ISLAMABAD: In an interview with a Dawn panel, the Chairman of the
National Reconstruction Bureau, Lt-Gen Tanvir Naqvi, spoke on
various issues related to the local government system established
on Aug 14.

A little more time was taken in preparing the electoral rolls, as a
result of which the local government elections had to be put
forward slightly, thus giving less time to newly elected local
representatives to set up their offices, explained Lt-Gen Naqvi
when asked if the launching of the local government system could
have been better planned.

"The administrative machinery, namely, the district transition
teams, headed by the District Coordination Officers (DCO), and the
tehsil transition teams also took a little more time than expected
to be established, thus, giving them less time to get organized,"
he continued.

"Yet life is running normally at the district and tehsil levels and
there has been no dip in service delivery, apart from some minor
problems regarding domicile and citizenship matters, which are
expected in any change in the system," reaffirmed Gen Naqvi.

There was no confusion in the devolution law about the Nazim being
the actual head of the district government, he said when asked to
comment on the relationship between the Nazim and the DCO. "Working
under the Nazims are all the officers of the district
administration and all the government departments. The local
administration has never been so coherently organized in this
manner," he added.

"We have ensured that the language in the devolution law is
readable. We are in the process of translating it into Urdu to make
the law more accessible to the common man," said Gen Naqvi.

Asked if the police would be accountable to the Nazim or the
provincial Inspector-General of Police, he said that as far as
maintenance of public peace and order was concerned, the district
police officer was responsible to the Zila Nazim.

"As far as prevention of crime is concerned, the district police
officer is answerable according to the laws as laid down in the
Criminal Procedural Code (CrPC) and the Police Act. Under the CrPC,
the judiciary will take care of any errant policeman. Under the
Police Act, police behaviour will be checked by the chain of
command or hierarchy," he said

The NRB chairman said that although the new Police Act had yet to
be passed, there was no vacuum in the functioning of the police.

The new District Public Safety Commissions (DPSC) was the mechanism
that was being established to allay public fears about the police
being misused by the elected representatives or anybody else, said
Lt-Gen Naqvi.

"If the district police officer is given an illegal order, for
instance, he can refuse to obey and seek recourse in the District
Public Safety Commissions, which will then examine the case and
pass instructions accordingly. The decision of the DPSC is final,"
reassured Lt-Gen Naqvi.

There are also plans to establish such Public Safety Commissions
(PSCs) at the provincial and national levels. Half of the
membership of all levels of PSCs will consist of elected
representatives while the other half will be people from the civil
society. The latter will be identified by a panel of selectors who
will give a list of twice as many names as is required for the
commission.

"There will be no police representation in these PSCs because they
are meant to protect the public's interests from any errant police
behaviour," said Lt-Gen Naqvi.

A new comprehensive financial system was being carefully worked out
for the local governments by a team of local as well as foreign
experts on fiscal decentralization, replied Lt-Gen Naqvi when asked
about the budget for the local governments.

A formula will be worked out to determine the amount of money
different cities and districts with different populations should be
allocated.

"Meanwhile, an interim financial system is in place to enable the
local governments to function for the time being," said Lt-Gen
Naqvi. "Under this system, the provincial governments will make the
district budgets under different sectors of education, health,
agriculture, soil conservation, etc. But authority is being given
to the district governments to make intra-sector and inter-sector
re-appropriations.

"The district and tehsil Nazims must have the discretion to use the
money in accordance with the priorities as dictated by the people,"
Lt-Gen Naqvi asserted.

He said the districts would be empowered to collect users charges
from those using the educational and health facilities.

On the question of the need or otherwise for a constitutional
amendment to constitute provincial finance commissions, Lt-Gen
Naqvi said that the matter was being looked into and relevant
inputs from various sources were being sought in order to come to
an acceptable consensus on the issue.

The NRB was working on two basic mechanisms to ensure transparency,
and therefore efficiency and control of corruption, revealed Lt-Gen
Naqvi.

"One is the Public Information Act under which the minimum of
information will be classified as confidential or secret at the
district levels. The other is the National Reconstruction
Information Management System through which the public will have
access to information through the computer or the telephone. Under
this system, there will be an IT office at every district and
tehsil where the public can have access to information through a
computer system. The NRB has already developed a software for this
purpose and a pilot model is already running in the Chakwal
district," Lt-Gen Naqvi said.

When asked why local government elections had yet to take place in
the Islamabad, Lt-Gen Naqvi said that the capital territory's case
was a very peculiar one and its legal framework was also very
different, and hence there had been different points of view on how
it should be done. "More time is being taken to deliberate on it
very carefully to ensure that the local government system
established in Islamabad will be one based on a strong foundation.

"The cantonments are also a peculiar if not complex situation and
the NRB is studying it very carefully," said Lt-Gen Naqvi. He,
however, he held out an assurance that the cantonments would have
local governments eventually, by the end of this year or early next
year.

"We want to make sure that we develop a correct and durable legal
basis for creating local governments in the cantonments. It will be
a challenge of how to harmonize the cantonment system with that of
the local government system."

Lt-Gen Naqvi assured that the district monitoring teams,
overlooking the functioning of the new local governments, would
eventually be phased out along with the military government.

"Being renamed as support teams, their job is only to act as
catalysts to make sure that the district and tehsil local
governments are established as they are supposed to, and that they
are entrenched to function in the manner that they are supposed
to," said Lt-Gen Naqvi.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Aug 30: An important meeting of the Alliance for the
Restoration of Democracy, Sindh unanimously rejected the
government's proposed roadmap for general election scheduled for
October-2002 and alleged that all such steps are aimed at achieving
desirous results out of polls.

The meeting, chaired by PPP Sindh leader Nisar Ahmed Khoro at his
residence, alleged that government is seeking to bring
constitutional amendments through a committee consisting of
favourites.

The meeting declared all such government steps illegal and harmful
to the nation and refused to accept amendments to Constitution. The
right to amend the constitution rests with the elected parliament
only and nobody else has any right even to touch it.

The meeting termed the frequent constitutional amendments as
conspiracy against the integrity of the country and an attempt to
bulldoze democratic values. It demanded that government provide
funds to the elected representatives, end confusion among them by
taking some practical steps, and restore their confidence.-PPI

<a name="govt">Govt-PPP 'deal in offing'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sarfaraz Ahmed

KARACHI, Aug 26: The Pakistan People's Party and the government are
inching towards entering into a deal ahead of next year's general
elections.

Highly-reliable sources told Dawn that the government is looking
forward to bring to an end, however for a brief period, Benazir's
role in the country's politics.

Notwithstanding the cases pending in courts against the PPP
chairperson, the government is also looking towards Benazir's
continuing absence from the country for the period between now and
the next general elections.

The sources told Dawn that the recent Makhdoom-Musharraf meeting
had discussed the possibilities of providing an even-playing field
to Pakistan People's Party in the next year's elections.

The sources said the party would have to choose a new chairperson
to replace Benazir in the near future in a bargain for an end to
what the PPP calls political victimization of its leaders and
workers.

Given the PPP's performance in the recently concluded elections
across the country, the establishment now finds it difficult to
create any serious challenges for the party towards the elections
except for weakening its base in Punjab from where the PPP has
shown signs of re-emergence following its show in the local bodies
elections.

The man credited for this improved show is party's secretary
general Jahangir Badar, who has recently been arrested by NAB in
corruption cases. His absence would definitely remain conspicuous
no matter how much more the party does in the country's largest
province to strengthen its power base and brighten its prospects in
the next general elections. The government offer also envisages the
release of Jahangir Badar once the deal is formalised, the sources
said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 26: The Lahore organization of the Pakistan People's
Party (women's wing) has urged the government to withdraw cases
against party chairperson Benazir Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari and
Jehangir Badar.

A resolution to this effect was adopted at a meeting held at the
Nicholson Road office of ARD chief Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan. The
meeting was presided over by Lahore PPP women's wing president
Sajida Mir.

Through another resolution, the meeting warned the military regime
against tinkering with the Constitution and said the masses would
not accept any amendment to it.

Sajida Mir said the defeat of government-backed candidates in LB
polls had unnerved the rulers, and they had started arresting
political leaders. She said the arrest of PPP secretary-general
Jehangir Badar was the latest example in this respect. Women's wing
activists would launch a protest drive against the government if
Zardari, Badar and other political prisoners were not released
within two weeks, she threatened.

<a name="gets">Pakistan gets Benazir's artefacts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, Aug 31: An anti-corruption inquiry is poised to bring
charges against former prime minister and PPP Chairperson Benazir
Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari over claims that they used
millions of dollars from illegal kickbacks on government contracts
to buy properties in Britain, including a mansion in Surrey, south
of London, called Rockwood House.

A lawyer at the centre of a two-year investigation claimed there
was overwhelming proof that Asif Zardari bought Rockwood, a $7.25
million nine-bedroom house set on 350 acres and "a number of other
substantial" homes in London.

William Pepper, an American attorney who is advising prosecutors in
Islamabad, said the money used to pay for the deals "rightfully
belongs to the government of Pakistan," not Mr Zardari or Ms
Bhutto. The Bhuttos have consistently denied wrongdoing, saying
they are the victims of a political conspiracy.

In another significant development, artifacts left at Rockwood
House when it was abandoned five years ago have been delivered to
the Pakistan high commission in London. The belongings, including
gifts given to the couple when they were in power, were handed over
on Tuesday following a request from Pakistan's National
Accountability Bureau (NAB) to Paul Keating, a building contractor
who was left in-charge of the property.

The goods included a framed picture of Ms Bhutto, a commemorative
blue plate with her name engraved on it and a plaque with two first
World War bayonets. An inscription on the wooden frame says:
"Presented to Asif Zardari from Wilkinson's Swords". The NAB is
also hoping to recover a stuffed Bengal tiger that was delivered to
Rockwood.

Mr Zardari, who is facing trial in Pakistan on other matters, has
denied buying the house. Benazir Bhutto, now in exile in Dubai, has
insisted that she knew nothing about the property. She believes the
allegations against her and her husband have been trumped up by
their political enemies as part of an effort to keep her from
returning to the country and regaining power.

Benazir Bhutto has told the London-based Guardian newspaper she had
asked her husband "on 10 occasions" if he had bought Rockwood, and
that he had consistently denied it. "I have never seen the
paperwork to prove it. I do not believe he had anything to do with
it."

However, in a recent interview, Ms Bhutto conceded that Mr Zardari
might have bought it after all. "Perhaps he did," she said.
"Although he tells me no". She also distanced herself from her
husband's work. "(He) never interfered in my work and I never
interfered in his," she said.

The net around the Bhuttos has been tightening since Gen Pervez
Musharraf seized power two years ago. British Home Office agreed to
give the NAB bundles of confidential documents relating to Mr
Zardari's activities in the UK.

The papers included the findings of an investigation, and
statements given under oath by Mr Zardari's friends and business
associates during private hearings at London's Bow Street
magistrate's court.

Investigators claim it is highly unlikely that Ms Bhutto would not
have known that her husband, whom she appointed as investment
minister in her last government, was taking kickbacks.

Speaking in New York, William Pepper said: "There is no doubt that
the Rockwood property was bought by Mr Zardari. There is no doubt
about that at all. There are also substantial other properties in
London.

Meanwhile, the Pakistan High Commission in London confirmed that it
had received artefacts from Rockwood House.

"They will be sent to Islamabad. If the house did not belong to the
Bhuttos, it's hard to understand why these personal belongings were
there. Some of the artifacts appear to be gifts given to them when
they were in power."

The NAB has already brought a series of corruption charges against
Ms Bhutto and Mr Zardari. In June, Bhutto was convicted in her
absence for three years for failing to attend court hearings.-
Dawn/Guardian News Service

Meanwhile, an Indo-Asian News Agency report said that Pakistan was
planning to seek the extradition of Benazir Bhutto from Britain to
prosecute her for largescale transfers of money out of the country.

Quoting well-placed Pakistani sources, the report said the move
follows new evidence this week linking Ms Bhutto and her husband to
the purchase of Rockwood Estate, a 350-acre estate in Surrey.

<a name="jima">JI may say goodbye to PML-N, PPP</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Aug 29: Realizing that it negated its years of vigorous
campaign against the PPP and the PML-N by joining hands with them
in the recent local elections, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now thinking
of distancing itself from them, party sources say.

The party expects a furious reaction from its supporters against
electoral adjustments made with these parties and the soft attitude
adopted towards them, and is considering an appropriate strategy to
appease them.

To make them believe that the party genuinely repents what may be
regarded as a shift in the policy witnessed in the recent past, the
Jamaat will let its supporters and voters know that there is no
change in its thinking about these parties and it still regards
them as two faces of the same coin.

The Jamaat also intends to carry out its future campaign against
the present government from its own platform -- without forming an
alliance with other parties. However, the three-party Jamhoori
Group set up in Lahore at the time of elections will be kept
intact.

The party does not see any contradiction in working with the PPP
and the PML-N locally and campaigning against them at the national
level.

<a name="judi">Judiciary opposes govt move to set up military courts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Aug 28: A rift is developing between the government and
the judiciary over the establishment of a parallel judicial system
manned by uniformed officers for the trial of alleged terrorists.

Sources told Dawn that the judiciary was opposing the government's
move for the establishment of military courts for trying civilians
and had discreetly conveyed to the government that it would not
serve the purpose and boomerang.

The government was also cautioned that the establishment of any
kind of special court for the trial of terrorists would result in
protracted litigation, they added. Besides, it was conveyed to the
government that it would be difficult for the judiciary to
countenance the military courts when it had already declared a
parallel judicial system unconstitutional in 1999. However, sources
said, the government had not abandoned the idea, though it may
delay the setting up of these courts for a few months.

The sources said the government, through a deliberate leak,
conveyed to the chief justices committee (CWC), which met on
Saturday to deliberate upon this issue, that it was going ahead
with its plan.

The sources said the military government, when faced with a threat
of terrorism recently, sought quick solutions. The interior
ministry suggested that terrorists were emboldened due to delay in
the disposal of terrorism cases.

The ministry held the judiciary responsible for the resurgence of
terrorist activities.

The sources said the chief justice was doing everything to dissuade
the government from creating a parallel judicial system. There was
also some straight talk at the CJC meeting where members defended
the role of the judiciary. "The basic fault lies with the police
which, in the first instance, do not arrest the accused, and
secondly a number of innocent persons are also roped in, making it
difficult for the courts to ascertain the innocence or guilt of
persons named in the FIR," the CJP told the meeting.

The CJC, comprising all the chief justices of the superior courts,
asked the government to provide adequate manpower and
infrastructure for the anti-terrorism courts for expeditious
disposal of cases.

<a name="newp">New police setup for Sindh by Oct 12: Rs651m sought</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 29: The Sindh police have sought Rs651 million from
the provincial government to carry out the restructuring of the
police department before October 12, under the devolution plan of
the federal government.

Well-placed sources told Dawn that a meeting between the officials
of the provincial finance department and the Sindh police was held,
where the finance department had agreed to sanction more or less
Rs300 million to the Sindh police. The sources said that the
exercise to implement the new police set-up in the province had
almost been completed.

The police set-up for Karachi would comprise an IG, five DIGs and
SPs one each in 18 towns. Earlier, four DIGs were sanctioned to be
working under the IG Karachi but the post for DIG, Crime
Intelligence Department (CID) was created and notified by the
provincial government.

The sources said that the existing Anti-Terrorist Wing would be
merged into the CID and it would work under the IG Karachi. The CID
would track down terrorists and those involved in sectarian, ethnic
or any other kind of terrorism. The CID would solve the cases,
arrest the culprits and hand them over to the investigation
department. It would also carry out certain measures to break the
network of terrorists.

The sources said 260 officials would be transferred to the CID from
the existing police strength. The police would be transformed into
a new set-up before October 12. The transformation would be carried
out in phases.

In the first stage, Sindh would be divided virtually into two
separate parts on the basis of the police set-up. Two independent
inspector generals of the police will be appointed in the province.
The sources claimed the appointment of two IGs had become
imperative after certain amendments in the Police Act 1861.

According to the proposal submitted to the provincial government,
an IG would head the Karachi district assisted by five DIGs - DIG
Administration, DIG operation, DIG Investigation, DIG Traffic, and
DIG CID.

In the new set-up different sections would be divided on functional
basis, and not on jurisdiction basis, to be headed by DIGs.
Besides, the SP Special Branch, SP Central Reserves, SP Security,
SP Training and SP Legal would be directly under the command of the
Karachi police chief. All of these SPs would be in Grade 19.

The DIG operation would be responsible for maintenance of law and
order and 18 SPs of all the towns would work under his command. The
DIG investigation would supervise eight SPs - SP administration, SP
homicide, SP crime against person, SP crime against property, SP
ACLC, SP forensics, SP Criminal Record Office and SP anti-
terrorism.

Eleven SPs would work under the DIG traffic who would be AIGP
admin. The eleven SPs would be AIGP accident investigation, AIGP
engineering and education, AIGP communication and transport, SP MVI
Branch, SP driving licence branch and five traffic controlling SPs
in the city.

The sources said that the ranks of AIGP and SP were equal; SP
worked in the field and the AIGP was the staff officer. The sources
said that some police stations overlapped two towns or union
councils which could create problems in future for the police and
the elected representatives. So It has been proposed that the
number of police stations- 98 at present- should not be increased.

The sources said a police station would comprise two or three union
councils. In some places it would comprise one union council
depending on the population of the union councils.

KARACHI, Aug 25: Four policemen were shot dead and seven others,
including an under trial prisoner and two civilians, were injured
in an ambush in Malir. A senior police official said Shoaib Khan, a
businessman, allegedly involved in the kidnapping of his rival
businessman, Haji Ibrahim, was being taken back to Landhi jail in a
prisoners' van after hearing of the case in the anti- terrorism
court-II in Sultanabad, when the van came under attack near Malir
bridge.

Shoaib Khan was hit by three bullets. He was rushed to Aga Khan
Hospital where he was stated to be out of danger. Three passersby,
were also injured in the firing.

A senior police official said the statements of witnesses collected
on the scene showed that the assailants were at least 10 in number,
and they were standing on both sides of Malir bridge. As the
prisoners' van and the police mobile climbed up the Malir bridge,
the assailants opened intense fire. They had first targeted the
driver of the Prisoners' van, Pervez Akhtar, who died on the spot,
and the van stopped after hitting against a moving car. The
assailants continued the firing for several minutes and then
escaped in probably three cars. He said since the case was of a
sensitive nature involving two businessmen, security was provided
to the under trial prisoner.

<a name="mini">Former minister remanded in RAB custody</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Aug 28: An ex-provincial minister, Mohammad Ayub Tanoli,
was remanded in the custody of Regional Accountability Bureau (RAB)
for 14 days by an accountability court.

Tanoli was arrested on Monday night in Abbottabad on the order of
NAB on the charges of possessing assets disproportionate to his
known sources of income.

He was produced here before the accountability court presided over
by Miftauddin Khan for getting his physical custody.

The RAB has claimed that initial investigation against the accused
revealed that he owned property worth Rs25.3 million inclusive of
two luxurious bungalows in Sherwan and Abbotabad. The NAB alleged
that he purchased and sold cars and vehicles like Land Cruiser,
Pajero, etc. on profit.

Tanoli told newsmen in the premises of the accountability court
that he was falsely implicated in the present case. He said that he
did not possess any property and the one mentioned by the NAB
belonged to his wife.

"My father-in-law, Mohammad Afzal Khan, was a big landlord and
during land reforms of 1964 the government took away 80,000 kanals
from him," the former minister said, adding despite that he
possessed 11,000 kanal of land. He said that he still practised law
although he was 65 since he had no other source of income.

The RAB, in its press release issued, claimed that the accused
hailed from a middle class family and inherited land measuring 12
kanals- 15 marlas in his native village Sherwan, located near
Abbottabad. The annual yield from that piece of land was estimated
up to Rs10,000.

Brothers of the accused were low paid government servants, which
testified to the family's overall socio-economic status. Initial
inquiry, the RAB alleged, revealed that during construction of the
house in Sherwan, the accused had encroached upon government land
measuring 15 marlas, the property of government hospital adjacent
to it.

<a name="imfw">IMF wants Pakistan to bridge fiscal gap</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Khaleeq Kiani

ISLAMABAD, Aug 29: Pakistan will have to submit a set of new
adjustment measures to bridge fiscal gap before the executive board
of the International Monetary Fund, which meets in Washington next
month.

Sources in donor agencies told Dawn that these measures should
include some revenue adjustments besides steps to contain
expenditures to enable the IMF to release last tranche of about
$133 million of the Standby Arrangement (SBA).

Without quantifying the fiscal gap, these sources said that
Pakistani authorities would submit this adjustment strategy to the
IMF before the executive board meeting.  Based on these measures,
the IMF managing director would recommend the executive board to
complete the final review under the ongoing SBA and facilitate
talks on larger financing assistance of Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility.

Sources in the finance ministry agreed that the IMF mission's main
focus during the just concluded talks was on bridging around Rs15
billion gap between revenue and expenditure but the emphasis was
that adjustment measures should not touch the development budget.

An IMF statement, however, said that the mission that left Pakistan
on Wednesday morning would advise its managing director to
recommend the completion of the final review under the current
Standby Arrangement. This would enable Pakistan to receive the last
tranche of the SBA worth about $133 million. The two sides would,
however, start talks on the future PRGF next month in Washington
and then in October in Islamabad.

The statement issued by Henri Ghesquiere, the IMF's senior resident
representative in Pakistan, said that the IMF team led by Klaus
Enders left Islamabad following completion of discussions with the
Pakistani authorities.

"The mission team confirmed Pakistan's solid macroeconomic
performance including low inflation, a strengthening of the balance
of payments and reduction of fiscal imbalances," it said.

The statement said the economic growth was expected to accelerate
in the current fiscal year that ends in June 2002. The mission also
held fruitful discussions on the government's strategy for poverty
reduction and sustained economic growth with a view to providing
support for the strategy with financial assistance under the PRGF.

The Pakistani authorities intend to continue these discussions
during the annual meetings in Washington at the end-September and
with a follow-up IMF mission that will visit Pakistan in the second
half of October 2001.

<a name="rese">Reserves to be raised to safe level by 2004</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Aug 28: Pakistan is likely to have a fully flexible
exchange rate in place by 2004 as by that time the country is
expected to improve gradually its official foreign exchange reserve
(FER) to a safe level of 12 weeks of imports of goods and services.

This level of FER, about $3.6 billion in absolute terms (excluding
gold, foreign assets relating to FCDs contracted after May 1998
(FE-25s), and short-term foreign exchange swaps and outright
forward sales by the SBP), is expected to allow the State Bank
enough cushion to absorb some short-term fluctuations that would
follow the launching of a fully flexible exchange rate regime.

But this happy scenario seems totally dependent on an official
projection which shows the FER shooting up to over $2.3bn,
(equivalent of 8.7 weeks of import bill) by the end of this year
from last year's estimated $1.4bn (6.1 weeks of import bill).

This amount is expected to go up to $2.8bn in 2002-03 (10.1 weeks
of import bill) and then to $3.6bn (12 weeks of import bill).

<a name="sbpr">SBP removes Nostro limits</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Aug 31: The State Bank withdrew restriction from the banks
on their holding of foreign currencies abroad but it left intact
the exposure limits for overbuying or overselling of foreign
exchange.

In plain words each bank was directed not to hold abroad foreign
exchange worth more than 20 per cent of its paid-up capital. At the
same time an exposure limit of 10 per cent was set for the banks.
Or in other words each bank was supposed to keep its uncovered
buying or uncovered selling of foreign currencies on a single day
at not more than 10 per cent of its paid-up capital. An uncovered
buying means buying foreign currency from A without selling an
equal amount to B and vise versa.

This restriction on uncovered buying and uncovered selling is still
in place.

Senior bankers said SBP has withdrawn Nostro limits of banks as
part of further liberalization of foreign exchange program being
followed on the insistence of the IMF.
Further liberalization of foreign exchange regime was one of key
conditions attached with the $596 million IMF standby loan approved
for Pakistan in late November 2000.

Pakistan will get the last tranche of this 10-month loan next
month.

<a name="oper">Operation of NDFC accounts stopped: Govt declares moratorium</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Khaleeq Kiani

ISLAMABAD, Aug 28: All the branches of National Development Finance
Corporation have been closed down with immediate effect following a
moratorium on its accounts imposed by the federal government.

The NDFC sources told Dawn that a letter issued by the Ministry of
Finance declared moratorium on the NDFC and directed its
headquarters in Karachi to close down all branches till further
orders.

The same letter was accordingly faxed to the NDFC branches
throughout the country to inform them about the moratorium. This
meant that there would be no transactions or payments from any of
the 35 NDFC branches to the depositors and account holders.

Banking sector sources said that moratorium was applicable for a
minimum period of 180 days, but the NDFC sources said that finance
ministry directive was silent on the subject. The decision is the
follow up of a government decision to merge NDFC with the National
Bank of Pakistan.

The NDFC has a deposit base of around Rs24 billion and around
200,000 account holders. Around 900 employees were currently
working with the NDFC throughout the country.

A finance ministry official said the moratorium was just for a
couple of days and situation for the account would be clear after
this transitional period.

Till recently, the NDFC was able to settle loans worth Rs700
million only and that too through the intervention of the National
Accountability Bureau, out of a Rs15.8 billion non-performing loans
portfolio.

There were a total of 106 industrial units spread all over the
country that owed Rs30 million or more to NDFC. In total, this
amount comes to over Rs15.8 billion, of which the higher courts
have already issued decrees for the recovery of Rs8.6 billion.

The non-performing loan portfolio comprised three categories.
Operating units stood at 50, closed units at 49, while
restructuring was underway at seven units. The data that was
compiled in the first week of July reflected the position of non-
performing loans up to May 31, 2001, and included some of the big
names from the business, industry and political circles.

As regards 49 closed units, a total of Rs4.912 billion is
outstanding against them and the higher courts have issued decrees
for recovery of Rs3.989 billion. Non-performing loans of Rs8.66
billion are outstanding against the 50 operating units, and the
higher courts have issued decrees for the recovery of Rs4.637
billion.

The NDFC is the country's largest development finance institution
that doled out politically-motivated loans worth billions of rupees
in the past many years, resulting into a big portfolio of infected
loans that impaired the financial health of the corporation.

Among other activities, the NDFC was the lead manager of around $3
billion Private Sector Energy Development Fund (PSEDF) of the World
Bank and other international financial institutions that financed
the independent power producers (IPPs) in Pakistan.

programs while rest of $567.6 million is scheduled to be approved
by December 2001 under seven projects and program financial

ISLAMABAD, Aug 28: The International Monetary Fund mission

'positive note' but asked for achieving the original revenue target
of Rs457.7 billion at all costs.

"Everything has gone well and the mission is leaving on Wednesday
morning," a senior finance ministry official told Dawn after the
wrap up meeting. He said that talks concluded positively but
refused to elaborate. The reporters were asked to wait for an
official IMF release but were informed at midnight that it would
come on Wednesday.

Informed sources said the visiting IMF delegation did not agree
with the government on downward revision in the revenue target. It,
however, agreed with the government side that it would be difficult
to go beyond Rs445 billion on the basis of last year collection.

The sources said that talks on the stand-by arrangement (SBA) had
been successful and the last tranche of about $133 million was
expected to be released after the IMF board meeting next month.

<a name="rs30">Rs30bn appears unaccounted for</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Aug 25: The IMF has found an estimated over Rs30 billion
unaccounted for on the expenditure side in the last year's budget.
In its second review of the ongoing Standby Arrangement (SBA) which
was completed in July and released in mid-August, the Fund staff
has reported an "unidentified expenditure amounting to 0.9 per cent
of GDP."

The missing billions - a level comparable to the pattern of
previous years -, according to the Fund review, could "partially
account for the low level of recorded federal development
spending." The government, however, has denied that defence
spending was a part of the unidentified expenditure.

"The authorities (Government of Pakistan) explained, however, that
defence spending was monitored with particular attention and could
not be part of the unidentified expenditure," the review added,
without saying whether or not it agreed with the explanation.

The review said that on the expenditure side, the medium-term
framework assumed that defence spending would be kept stable in
real terms; an expansion of poverty-related spending by at least
0.3 per cent of GDP each year over the next three years, and a wage
and pension bill that would be constant as a share of GDP over the
same period. Under this medium-term scenario of the Fund, the
budgetary deficit is expected to come down to 3 per cent of GDP by
2003/4 as the revenue increased by 0.4 per cent of GDP on average
annually over the next three years.

The slightly less than previously envisaged increase in tax revenue
has been attributed to the "expected medium-term negative impact of
the business-friendly income tax reforms launched this year."
"Income tax rates will be progressively brought down with
significant reduction for banks and companies, surcharges will be
eliminated, and the most distortive, presumptive and withholding
tax schemes, including those on imports and contracts, will be
phased out starting in 2002/03," the review projected.

The negative impact of lower tax rates is expected to be
progressively offset by positive supply-side and governance-
enhancing effects, "as the reform will reduce sources of corruption
in the tax administration, provided that these measures are
accompanied by the envisaged fundamental reform in the CBR."

The review advised the authorities to aim their reforms at phasing
in over the next 2-3 years self-assessment and more automated
procedures and thus reduce the need for face-to-face contact
between taxpayers and tax officials. The review expressed concern
once again about SBP's continued purchases on the kerb market and
sales in the inter-bank market to finance oil imports, and
emphasized the need for a truly market-based flexible rate, with
minimum intervention.

The IMF staff noted that some of the observed volatility reflected
the 'exchange rate cycles' induced by SBP policy - a relatively
stable exchange rate in the period following IMF programme target
dates, leading to the depletion of official foreign reserves,
followed by subsequent substantial exchange rate depreciation and
interest rate increases to meet the reserves target as the next
Fund program target date was getting closer.

<a name="nbps">NBP shares' offer to test market appetite</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 26: The government will offer five to ten per cent
of its shares in all the nationalised commercial banks, financial
institutions and gas utilities to the general public through stock
market provided the National Bank of Pakistan attracts encouraging
investment next month.

A senior official at Privatisation Commission told Dawn that NBP's
initial public offering (IPO) was being launched as a pilot project
to assess the market appetite.

"This is going to be some sort of pilot project....a test case for
the privatisation program and market potential as well. If the
response is encouraging, the government would offer other banks and
utilities to the general public in the same way," said the
official.

The official said that 10 per cent shares of National Bank of
Pakistan (NBP) would be offered to the general public in the last
week of September in two equal lots of 18.5 million shares at par
value of Rs10 per share.

He said that all preparations for the subscription of initial 5 per
cent NBP (18.5 million) shares have been finalised during meetings
of Privatisation Commission, State Bank of Pakistan, and NBP in
Karachi last week.

In the coming week, prospectus of the issue would be presented to
the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) for
formal approval. A minimum of 1,000 shares would be offered to each
applicant with the choice of multiple buying as well. This would be
followed by a marketing campaign and hopefully the official
advertisement for the subscription of initial 5 per cent NBP shares
would be in the press by the second week of September.

<a name="limi">Limited withdrawal from NDFC allowed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 30: The State Bank announced that individual
depositors of NDFC having deposits up to Rs100,000 will be able to
draw the principal amount from September 5.

It said the depositors would get profit on their deposits up to Aug
27, 2001 which implied that they would not get any profit on the
deposits after this date. The NDFC sources said 35,000 out of over
100,000 account holders of NDFC have deposits up to Rs100,000 each.

No official word was available about the total amount lying in the
accounts of those who have deposits up to Rs100,000. But the
sources said the amount was equal to or a little more than 10 per
cent of the total deposits worth Rs27 billion.

By end-December 2000, the NDFC had Rs28 billion deposits but that
started declining as investors got wind of the government plans of
either closing it down or merging it with some other institution.

The SBP also said payment to individual account holders having
deposits between Rs100,001 and Rs500,000 would be made by the NDFC
in the third week of October before its amalgamation with the NBP
in November. "The deposits of the remaining account holders will
then be automatically transferred to the NBP."

"To facilitate the smooth transfer of depositors' money to the NBP,
their (NBP's) staff will be present at the NDFC branches to assist
in the process," said a SBP press release. The release was issued
after SBP Governor Dr Ishrat Husain had a meeting in his office
with NDFC Chairman Badaruddin Khan and NBP President Ali Raza.

The SBP said non-performing loans of NDFC will be transferred to
Corporate & Industrial Restructuring Corporation for disposal
through auctions. It said non-performing loans of NDFC were about
80 per cent of its total loan portfolio. It gave no numbers.

Explaining the rationale behind the decision to amalgamate NDFC
with NBP the State Bank said that the first option before the
government was to revive or restructure the corporation as a viable
and sustainable entity but upon close examination this was not
found feasible.

"As a second option, efforts were made to merge NDFC with IDBP but
it also became clear on scrutiny that the proposed merger would not
have achieved the purpose." But sources in the NDFC said the
decision to amalgamate the corporation was taken to meet a key
World Bank condition attached with its proposed $300 million loan
for the restructuring of the financial sector. The condition calls
for closure of unviable non-bank financial institution and the NDFC
with a negative equity of Rs16 billion is one of them.

The SBP said that "keeping in view the strong position of NBP and
transfer of non-performing assets to the CIRC the proposed merger
of NDFC with NBP will not have any adverse impact on the financial
health or standing of NBP."

Meanwhile, some 800 employees of the state-run National Development
Finance Corporation are going to lose their jobs as a result of the
corporation's amalgamation with the National Bank.

The State Bank confirmed that the NDFC was being merged with the
NBP and that the exercise will be completed by November this year.
It said in a press release that the NDFC staff will be paid
"severance pay as admissible under the rules in order to provide
them financial relief." The term severance pay applies on the
package offered to the employees of an organisation at the time of
their retrenchment.

Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Aug 28: A hi-tech service agreement was signed here on
Tuesday between Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL)
and M/s ABS Corporation (Inc) of the USA on Voice Over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) Pilot Project.

Mr Iftikhar Ahmed Raja, Member Technical, signed the agreement on
behalf of the PTCL while Mr Derik Lee Jones, Co-Founder and Sr VP,
Corporate Strategy, signed the accord on behalf of the ABS.

Later, giving details of the agreement, a spokesman for the PTCL
said that in Pakistan some unscrupulous operators/individuals had
been involved in illegal termination of international voice traffic
by bypassing the PTCL International Gateway Exchange through hi-
tech arrangements. The introduction of the VoIP through this
agreements, he said, was an important step to combat this illegal
termination. Through this illegal operation, the PTCL and the
government were being deprived of legitimate foreign exchange
earnings, the spokesman said.

He said that this agreement and other such agreements likely to be
signed with international telecommunication companies in near
future, would be in-line with the objective to effectively counter
and mitigate the on-going illegal operations by capturing the off-
shore Grey Area Traffic.

He said that after the conclusion of the three agreements on VoIP,
an estimated investment of $3.5 million was expected.

The PTCL spokesman explained that through the said agreement, each
contracting firm would capture 3-5 million minutes of international
voice traffic per month to address the Grey Traffic challenge.

M/s ABS Corporation of the USA together with the PTCL will set up
VoIP infrastructure in Karachi and bring additional international
voice traffic from the USA and Europe. Other companies with whom
the agreements are expected to be signed will start their
operations in Lahore and Islamabad.

The spokesman said that about 17 bidders, including foreign and
Pakistani companies, had submitted their bid documents to the PTCL
against an open tendering which had been widely publicized by the
PTCL. These bids, he said, had been evaluated by the PTCL through
specially-constituted in-house Technology and Financial Committees
and a Committee of the Board of Directors (B0D) specially
constituted by the PTCL Board.

The spokesman said that this would be a pilot project to introduce
the IP technology in the country and a beginning for the PTCL to
gradually migrate to the IP technology in line with other world
countries.

<a name="lega">Legal proceedings begin today: Pfizer, Parke Davis merger</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Aug 27: The Sindh High Court will consider a joint
petition of the Pfizer Laboratories and Parke Davis, seeking
judicial consent for amalgamation of the two companies. Objections
on this proposed merger of the two companies have been filed by the
minority shareholders of both the companies, Pfizer and Parke
Davis. Those who object on this merger are Pakistan's leading
financial institutions as well as individual shareholders.

In their joint petition, both the corporations have informed the
court of the adoption of a scheme of arrangement by the
extraordinary general meetings (EOGMs) of their respective
shareholders in May this year for an amalgamation of Pfizer and
Parke Davis under which Pfizer is transferring and vesting Parke
Davis of all the assets, rights, liabilities and obligations.

"Amalgamation of petitioners (Pfizer and Parke Davis) is not in
accordance with the law and is liable to be rejected" is the
objection filed by four financial institutions of Pakistan who hold
a total of 19 per cent shareholding in Parke Davis. The National
Investment Trust (NIT) holds 14.4 per cent, the State Life
Insurance Corporation (Slic) 3.8 per cent, Pak Libya Holding
Company 0.7 per cent and Investment Corporation of Pakistan (ICP)
0.1 percent.

"There has been a complete lack of transparency in the process
leading up to the filing of petition before this honourable court,"
the NIT and three other financial institutions alleged in their
joint petition.

Zahid Husnain who holds 126,232 shares of the Pfizer Laboratories
has serious objections on the compensation swap ratio for the
shareholders. "The present shareholders of Pfizer Laboratories
Limited will receive one share of Rs10 par value in Parke Davis
Limited in lieu of 264 shares of Rs10 par value in Pfizer
Laboratories," informs Mr Husnain in his objection filed on his
behalf by his father Azfar Husnain. "This ratio of swap means that
a Pfizer Laboratories shareholder is being offered 0.38 of one per
cent of the par value of his share in Pfizer Laboratories," he
contends.

In money terms, Zahid will get 3.85 paisa worth of shares in Parke
Davis for every Rs10 invested in Pfizer Laboratories.

The NIT and three other minority shareholders of Parke Davis blame
Pfizer Laboratories of being actively involved in transfer pricing
by purchasing raw materials for its products from its parent
company at more than market prices, which in turn has contributed
towards its heavy losses.

The amalgamation of Parke Davis, a highly profitable concern with
Pfizer Laboratories, which has suffered heavy losses will "have
disastrous consequences" for Parke Davis and will lead to erosion
of value of the minority shareholders, while the "majority
shareholders will continue to benefit due to transfer pricing", the
NIT and three other financial institutions contend.

KARACHI, Aug 31: The KSE 100-share index, therefore, lost the
overnight gain and finished 6.54 points down at 1,258.44 as
compared to 1,264.98 a day earlier as all the leading base shares
fell, although fractionally under the lead of PTCL and Hub Power.

The much-awaited fertilizer policy did not create stir as was
speculated as it was short of the rumored incentive package needed
to boost the industry.

Shell profits at Rs.1.05 billion were off 19 per cent as compared
to the previous year, and 80 per cent final dividend minus the
bonus, as expected, kept its share value under pressure. Adamjee
Insurance's loss of Rs.212 million owing to massive claims of
Rs.1.67 billion in motor segment against the premium income of
Rs.1.49 billion put it in the negative accounting year apparently
for the first time after several decades.

Minus signs dominated the list but some leading shares managed to
finish with good gains on stray support, notably among them being
Ferozsons Lab, Glaxo-Wellcome, Lever Brothers and Dreamworld, which
posted gains ranging from Rs.2.00 to 4.00.

Alico, Shell Pakistan, Allwin Engineering and Service Industries
were others among the gainers, which rose by one rupee to Rs.1.25.

Exide Pakistan, Dawood Hercules and Wyeth Pakistan, which suffered
fall ranging from Rs.3.45 to 10.00 were leading losers followed by
EFU Life, Artistic Denim, Burewala Textiles, Pakistan Oilfields and
Aventis Pharma, off one rupee to Rs.1.90.

Trading volume was low at 29m shares as losers further extended
their lead over the gainers at 108 to 47, out of 203 actives, with
48 shares holding on to the last levels.

PTCL led the list of actives, easy 10 paisa at Rs.15.95 on 7m
shares, followed by Hub Power, lower 15 paisa at Rs.15.85 on 6m
shares, PSO, off 25 paisa at Rs.125.85 on 3m shares, Engro
Chemical, lower 50 paisa at Rs.53.95 on 2m shares and Nimir Risins
up 45 paisa at Rs.2.50 also on 2m shares.

Other actives were led by FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, easy by five paisa
on 1.397m shares, WorldCall, off 60 paisa on 1.117 shares, Adamjee
Insurance, lower 25 paisa on 0.996m shares, Fauji Fertilizer, off
35 paisa on 0.913m shares and Dewan Salman, lower 15 paisa on
0.727m shares.

FORWARD COUNTER: Active trading was witnessed on this counters as
investors took positions in the September delivery after offloading
stakes in the ruling August contracts. As the duration of the new
contract is one month as against previous 15 days, investor will
have enough manoeuvring leverage to play on both sides of the fence
depending on the objective situation, leading to bullish and
bearish hella if prices fluctuate either way by Rs.1.50.

Hub Power was actively traded as the trading volume swelled to 5m
shares, although both the settlements ended lower by 18 and 16
paisa at Rs.15.82 and 16.06 respectively.

PTCL followed, off 14 paisa at Rs.16.12 on 2.324m shares and PSO,
lower 40 paisa at Rs.129.25 on 0.858m shares. Others were modestly
traded.

DEFAULTER COMPANIES: Allied Motors came in for renewed selling, and
was quoted further lower by 65 paisa at Rs.2.80 on 4,000 shares,
followed by Colony Textiles, easy 35 paisa at Rs.8.40 on 1,500
shares and Mehran Jute, up five paisa at Rs.0.20 on 1,000 shares.

The KSE 100-share index, did not breach through the psychological
barrier of 1,300 points during the week as disappointed investors
started liquidating long positions after the sponsors of stock
stabilization fund failed to give the needed support to the market.

It finally ended the week, off 21.63 points at 1,268.62 as compared
to 1,290.25 a week earlier, eroding Rs2 billion from the total
market capitalization at Rs320 billion as compared to Rs322bn a
week earlier.

The relatively improved performance of the leading base shares,
notably the PTCL, the Hub-Power and the PSO limited the losses to a
manageable level.

On the corporate front, the dividend from the MCB at 12.5 per cent,
from the Atlas Honda at 40 per cent cash and 40 per cent bonus
shares and 30 per cent from the Central Insurance and an identical
announcements from the others were above the market perceptions and
did push prices of their respective stocks higher under the lead of
Atlas Honda, which surged by Rs10 but the weekend selling allowed
it close with clipped gains. The omission of dividend by the ICI
Pakistan worked against the underlying sentiment.

Energy shares led the market decline under the lead of the PSO and
the Shell Pakistan, which suffered fall followed by the Lever
Brothers, the Pak Reinsurance, Sana Industries, the Merit
Packaging, Al-Ghazi Tractors, the Clarinat Pakistan, Tata Textiles,
Janan Demalucho Textiles and the Knoll Pharma.

Other leading shares, which fell included Adamjee Insurance, Bata
Pakistan, Murree Brewery and Adam Sugar.

Nestle Pakistan was leading among the gainers up by Rs4 followed by
Din Textiles, Artistic Denim, Burewala Textiles, Wyeth Pak,
WorldCall, Service Industries, Lawrencepur Woollen, Dilon, Zaniab
Textiles and Atlas Honda.

Trading volume was maintained at the previous week's level of over
300 million shares, bulk of which was again shared by the PTCL,
Hubco and the PSO, followed by the MCB, Engro Chemical, Fauji
Fertiliser and the ICI Pakistan.

Other actives were led by the WorldCall payphones, Adamjee
Insurance, Telecard, the FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, Nishat Mills, Sui
northern, the PIAC, Nimir Resins and several others.

<a name="just">Justice?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, is today
the highest authority responsible for the administration (or
maladministration) of our courts of law which dispense justice.

Lest someone should hasten to deem otherwise, this statement is not
being made in this column in this newspaper with any intent to
commit contempt of the Chief Justice, or of any other honourable
justice of the Supreme Court, or of any court of Pakistan.

Considering that I stand charged with the offence of contempt of
court by no less than a bench of 14 judges of the Supreme Court of
Pakistan (including himself) to which offence I have pleaded 'not
guilty', the Chief Justice of Pakistan has done me a singular
honour by asking his registrar to send me a copy of the historic
suo moto Order delivered by him and his brother judge, Justice
Shaikh Riaz Ahmed, on August 10 2001, in the matter of 'On perusal
of Pakistan Law Commission's Report No.22 on the Criminal Justice
System'. In his letter, the registrar has written "This is a matter
of great public importance and may be of some interest to you." It
is, indeed.

The final paragraph of the order (34) reads: "The case being of
great public importance shall be heard by a larger bench to be
constituted by the Chief Justice. Meanwhile, notices shall be sent
to the advocates-general of the provinces for a date to be fixed in
office at an early date. The interior secretary, chief secretaries
of the provinces, the home secretary, the advocates-general and the
inspectors-general of police of the provinces shall appear
personally and assist the court in the resolution of the above
issues."

Considering the time it will take to issue notices,and fix a date
when all summoned will be available to present themselves in
Islamabad, it may well be that Justice Khan will by that time have
attained his retirement age and it may be that his successor in
office, Justice Bashir Jehangiri, who only has 25 days as Chief
Justice, will also have departed as he attains the age of 65 on
January 31,2002. He will be followed by Justice Shaikh Riaz Ahmed,
who will hold the office of Chief Justice until March 2003.

With all due respect, I wonder if the honourable Chief Justice has
had the time or occasion to read the report of our Human Rights
specialist, I. A. Rehman, headed '4,500 languishing in death cells
for 10 years', published in this newspaper on May 11, 2001.

According to Rehman, a count taken on March 13 this year discloses
that over 4,500 fellow citizens are confined in the death cells of
its prisons. Of these, 4,300 were in jails in Punjab. By now this
number will have increased as the average rate of increase is 600
per year. Rehman's report laments the fact that a large number of
these condemned prisoners have been rotting in their cells for many
years. The appeals of 1,600 are pending in the High Courts, of
which 1,300 have been pending for well over three years, some 300
for well over five years, and 10 for up to 10 years. In the Supreme
Court 217 appeals have been pending, ranging from periods of three
to 10 years. Lying in the President's secretariat are 40 mercy
petitions which have been waiting there from between five to 10
years. Two appeals against the death penalty lie in GHQ; one has
been there for five years, the other for 10.

As far as the mercy petitions are concerned, President General
Pervez Musharraf recently declared to Karachi's CPLC chief, Jameel
Yusuf, that no mercy petitions lie pending in his secretariat, so
one must presume that the 40 have got lost somewhere between the
federal ministries of interior and law.

This state of affairs is unlikely to shock or surprise anyone who
resides in this Republic of Pakistan.

On January 18, 1999, in Lahore, a friend of artist Zahoorul Akhlaq
walked into his studio, sat down, had tea and biscuits, then pulled
out a gun and shot dead Zahoor and his daughter Jehanara, and
severely wounded Jehanara's husband. The murderer was arrested,
held in the police lock-up, later jailed, and in May 1999 court
proceedings were instituted against him in an anti-terrorist court.
The case was called 85 times, for one reason or another adjourned
55 times, heard 30 times, and the murderer was sentenced to death
on May 9, 2001. Pretty swift, one might say.

The convicted man will now appeal to the High Court, then
presumably an appeal will be made to the Supreme Court. Making a
rough guess, this will take at least five years. If the man's
sentence is upheld, he will file a mercy petition which will get
lost somewhere in Islamabad and lie around for a further ten years
or so. We are looking forward to around 2016 before the man knows
whether he is to live or die, by which time it may be that the
death penalty will no longer apply in this country.

Now take the case of the son of the former 'Lion of Punjab', Bilal
Khar son of Ghulam Mustafa Khar. I distinctly remember being
introduced to the 'Lion' by his trainer and benefactor, Zulfikar
Ali Bhutto, in 1970. Bhutto was smoking a foot-long cigar, sitting
on a silver-plated throne he had borrowed. That particular day two
'Lions' had called on him, one from Punjab and one from the
Frontier, Mustafa Khar and Hayat Sherpao (later to be
assassinated). Khar survived and thrived and succeeded in marrying
(so far) ten wives and spawning a substantial brood of children.

One son, Bilal, also addicted to multiple marriages, picked up and
married a beautiful dancing girl of Karachi. During their three
years of marriage, the girl, Fakhra, was subjected to constant
physical abuse and finally returned home to her mother. In April
this year, Bilal walked into the mother's house, grabbed the girl's
head, held it back and poured acid over her face and neck which
dripped on to her arms and lower body. The incident received much
publicity in our press and in the foreign press (lately, Time
magazine of August 20). Bilal Khar, who nowhere on record has
denied his deed, has not been arrested, and walks free to throw
acid again.

It is inconceivable that the Chief Justice of Pakistan is not aware
of this incident. Should he not contemplate suo moto action against
the police who should have dealt with this matter and of course
against the perpetrator of the crime? The man should be tried,
chances are he will be convicted, and he should be put away to
serve a sentence as a lesson to him and a warning to all the other
many acid-throwers of this violence-prone country. Have our judges
no wives, mothers, sisters, daughters? Are the women of this
country destined for ever and with impunity to be treated as sub-
humans, and subjected to cruelty and humiliation without our law-
makers and dispensers of justice raising a finger in their support?

Finally, to the tragic case of a young lawyer of Karachi, Shakir
Latif. He went to school at St Patrick's, went on to the London
School of Economics, was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn,
returned to Karachi and joined a law firm. He lived with his
parents in their Defence home. Their neighbour, Amjad Malik, one
day in July invited Shakir over to his house and is alleged to have
poisoned and killed him. A letter, 'A mother's plea for justice',
was printed in this newspaper on August 12. How soon will it be
before the judges of Pakistan decide the case of Amjad Malik who is
now in police custody? How long will it be before the criminal
justice system in this country can mete out due punishment?

Shakir's parents weep over a letter written to Shakir by Roy Amlot,
QC,Chairman of the Bar of England and Wales, on March 8, 2001: "I
would like to offer you congratulations and my best wishes on your
call to the Bar. This is the culmination of years of hard work and
you have every reason to be proud. You have joined a great
profession which welcomes everyone of talent and commitment. The
strength of the Bar lies in its commitment to the principles of
justice, independence and excellence. If you follow those
principles your life at the Bar will be rewarding and successful.
You will have your chance to help people, often at their time of
greatest need. Your duty is to serve them and the court."

Now, we must ask the question, who will serve the cause of the
murdered young barrister?

<a name="indi">India's 'hidden apartheid'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Eric S. Margolis

In a uniquely Indian version of Romeo and Juliette, a teenage girl
and boy were publicly lynched earlier this month in rural Uttar
Pradesh. The girl's parents and hundreds of villagers watched and
applauded.

The crime? The girl was a Brahmin, the boy, a Jat. The girl's
family had been 'defiled' by their daughter crossing the 'pollution
barrier' to consort with a lower caste boy. The appropriate
punishment was death. This grisly event was by no means an unusual
event in rural India.

At the end of August, India, a self-professed champion of human
rights, will attend the UN conference on racism in Durban, South
Africa. While the US is frantically trying to shield its protege,
Israel, from charges of racism at Durban, India is just as
frantically trying to prevent its caste system, which is often
called 'hidden apartheid,' from being put onto the conference's
agenda.

For decades, India loudly denounced discrimination against blacks
in the US and South Africa. But hidden from the world's gaze,
India, according to many human rights groups, continues to practise
and condone the world's largest, most pernicious system of
institutionalized racism and discrimination, the caste system.

Of India's one billion people, 160 million are untouchables, or
'Dalits'(meaning: 'broken people'). They are India's poorest
people, performing society's most menial, degrading tasks. Dalit
organizations in India call their people 'black slaves.'
Shockingly, this writer learned a decade ago that anthropologists
had actually discovered a caste that was lower than untouchables.
They were a small number of outcasts whose status was so degraded
that they were not permitted to appear in daylight. They lived in
garbage dumps and emerged only at night to scavenge.

Untouchables are barred from sections of villages inhabited by
higher caste Hindus. A Dalit's 'unclean' shadow must never fall
upon that of a Brahmin, lest he be defiled. Dalits may not draw
water from higher caste wells, nor touch food implements of their
betters. They may not enter higher caste temples, nor own land.
Their children sit in the back of classrooms, or are simply denied
schooling.

The ancient Hindu caste system dates back to 1500 BC when fair-
skinned Aryan tribes invaded northern India. The newcomers
conquered India's dark-skinned indigenous Dravidian inhabitants.
Though occupation and rank originally determined caste, over
centuries caste came to be associated with skin colour. Even in
overseas Indian communities, including Canada, caste still reigns.
Marriage solicitations in India and among expatriate Indian
communities routinely request 'light-skinned' boys or girls.

Fair-skinned Brahmins, 3.5 per cent of the population, are India's
ruling elite, holding 78 per cent of judicial positions and half
parliament's seats. In recent tests, Indian scientists discovered
that high-caste Hindus, particularly Brahmins, are genetically
closer to Europeans than they are to dark-skinned Dravidian
Indians. Caste became a rigid system whereby India's fair-skinned
ruling class kept lower and swarthier orders in their places - as
labourers, landless peasants, and servants - exploiting them in the
name of religion.

The Sikh religion and Islam both reject the Hindu caste system.
Tens of millions of low caste Indians found refuge from racial
oppression as Sikhs, Muslims, and, more recently, Christians. All
three religions have been and remain subject to varying forms of
persecution by India's Hindu majority, which is becoming
increasingly intolerant of other religions.

Dalits are forced to clean public toilets and remove human feces,
usually with their hands. They sweep up after Indians defecate in
the streets and move dead animals. According to an extensive report
on caste by the respected Human Rights Watch, large numbers of
dalit women are routinely raped and forced to become sex slaves for
Hindu priests and land owners. Of India's estimated 40 million
indentured labourers - a modern form of slavery - most are Dalit
children, often sold into lifelong servitude by starving parents.

When Dalits try to defend themselves against abuse and
exploitation, they are attacked by higher caste gangs and local
police. Their shanties are burned and their women gang-raped.
Dalits, like Muslim Kashmiris, are frequently subjected to
beatings, rape, torture and arson by India's brutal police, says
Human Rights Watch. The recent case of India's famed 'Bandit
Queen,' a Dalit woman who killed a score of higher caste men who
had raped her, is but one dramatic example of the suffering
inflicted by India's cruel caste system, which makes South Africa's
former apartheid look benign by comparison.

The caste system has also found its way into Nepal, which just
officially banned it this summer; to Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri
Lanka and to the Indian communities in Canada, the US, the West
Indies, Fiji, South-east Asia, and South Africa. Even Indian Jews
developed a caste system of their own under pressure from India's
customs.

Human Rights Watch gave their 2000 Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights
Award to Martin Macwan, founder of the India's leading human rights
movement for Dalits. Macwan calls the plight of India's
untouchables one of the world's gravest and largest violations of
human rights.

Modern India's father, Mohandas Gandhi, struggled against caste and
called for liberation of Dalits. India outlawed discrimination
against untouchables in the 1950s, and has enacted affirmative
action programmes for Dalits in education, voting, and government
jobs. Nepal just followed suit this summer. India's president, a
ceremonial post, is a Dalit, though most of its leaders, like PM
Vajpayee and Home Minster L.K. Advani, are high-caste, fair-skinned
Hindus. Brahmins dominate the BJP and its 'politburo,' the shadowy
RSS, which was patterned in the 1930s after Hitler's National
Socialists and Mussolini's Fascists.

'The Indian government has been very successful at manufacturing an
image as the world's largest democracy,' says Smita Narula, author
of the Human Rights Watch report, ...'but none of its (anti-
discrimination) laws are implemented and the constitution is not
enforced.'

Delhi simply winks at the wide scale oppression of Dalits across
India, remembering them only at election time. India appears
unlikely to make a major national effort to root out the deeply
ingrained caste system until worldwide outrage shames India's elite
into taking drastic action. Durban would be a good start. India
won't achieve the international respect and great power status it
so craves until the evil of caste is ended for good.-Copyright

<a name="towa">Towards a junkyard of the spirit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

OURS has never been a land famous for the birth of ideas. Mystics
and poets we have had aplenty but original thinkers who could light
the way for the rest of us, hardly any. Even so, whatever little
potential we had in this regard was knocked out long ago by our
political tribulations - our failure to evolve a stable polity.

Political confusion exacts an economic price. This is a truism with
which we are all familiar. Less often realized is another
consequence of the same malady: the stifling of ideas. Tinpot
leadership, and we have had no other variety, is responsible for
this legacy.

We are a nation rooted in the myths of the past, inimical to fresh
ideas, challenged by originality of any kind. The only scientist of
world renown we had was Dr Abdus Salam. Yet we did not accept him
as one of our own because of his faith. There must be something
seriously wrong with a society which can think along such lines.

The government says it will bring madrassah learning in line with
modern education. Of course it will do no such thing because any
such undertaking is beyond the capability of the Pakistani state.
All the same, can the irony embedded in this resolve be lost on
anyone? The Islamic madrassahs are not the principal founts of
ignorance in this country. The pass we are in is not because of
madrassah education. When has the mullah held power? When has he
been close to the decision-making process? Not that we should
invite the Taliban in. We don't deserve that. But at least let us
get the perspective of things right.

Most of the baffling decisions which have marred the country's
destiny owe their origin to the Sandhurst types (civilian and
military) who have held the reins of power. Why did we go into the
'65 war? Why couldn't we get the measure of Bengali aspirations?
Why did Bhutto have to sully his government by his dictatorial
methods? Why did Zia and his generals fight America's war in
Afghanistan? What explains the corruption of Benazir Bhutto and the
Sharifs? What drove us to test our nuclear devices? What teaching
of Clausewitz encouraged the army high command to embark upon the
Kargil adventure?

Whence springs this zest for the irrational, for the course of
action that, if you weigh the costs and benefits, makes no sense at
all? Partly from political confusion, partly from the cultivation
of ignorance at the highest levels of government. If we have turned
the country into an intellectual graveyard it is bound to rub off
on the calibre of the governing class. Let me cite two examples.

The brightest minds then in government and the army conceived the
steps which led to the '65 war. Had we consciously gone to war it
would have been another matter. But Bhutto, Aziz Ahmed and Maj Gen
Akhtar Malik, acting under the guidance of the subcontinent's only
self-appointed field marshal, opted for a limited adventure in
Kashmir and for their pains saw the country sucked into a full-
fledged war with India. The folly of the exercise lay not so much
in the clash of arms as in the miscalculation behind it.

The second example. Prior to our nuclear tests in 1998, every card-
carrying intellectual on Islamabad's seminar circuit was in favour
of testing, more nonsense having been spouted on the nuclear
question than perhaps any other subject in Pakistan. Three years
later the earlier jingoism is no longer much in evidence, a nation
of nuclear hawks having gone suddenly quiet. After an all-night
binge, the morning-after feeling. Even the demotion from his
commanding perch of the country's Oppenheimer, Dr A. Q. Khan, has
passed without flap or protest. Of all changes in fashion this one
is the most surprising.

In the calculus of cause-and-effect wherein fits political failure?
It determines much of our floundering as a nation because
instability invites repetition. Every time we go off the rails,
every time a fresh crop of generals comes riding into the arena,
the country has to begin from the beginning, re-inventing the
wheel, rediscovering the obvious, regurgitating the same rhetoric
about politicians being villains and the country needing a strong
hand on the tiller.

So it is this time. General Musharraf and his knights are not
stepping into the future; they are marching back into the past,
taking the nation with them. The polity being fashioned is a
throwback to the past, the methods are the same, even the politicos
being fashioned into frontmen by the military government resemble
nothing so much as the Convention Leaguers of the sixties or the
Muslim Leaguers of the Zia era.

Ayub Khan's political experiments had an air of novelty about them
as they were being tried for the first time. Forty odd years later,
and with many other experiments intervening, General Musharraf's
political manoeuvres look about as fresh as the hills. Yet the
nation is expected to perform a conjuring trick and see originality
where there is none.

The sixties gave us our first dose of full-blown authoritarianism.
The gift of the seventies was half-baked socialism, from whose
nationalizing consequences the country has still to recover. The
eighties saw the crowning of a false Islamism whose most
conspicuous features were hypocrisy and social regression. Then
followed a period of corrupt and inept democracy. Now we are back
to recycling Bonapartism.

With the past having to be relived every now and then, it is hardly
surprising if Pakistan gives an impression of a wheel forever
turning at the same spot without moving forward. No wonder our
political discourse, whether issuing from the lips of military
paladins or out-of-work politicians, is so sterile. How are fresh
ideas to be born in such a self-defeating climate?

Failing to get politics right, what have we managed to create? A
top-heavy state structure which allows nothing to grow in its
shadow. Granted that Benazir and Nawaz Sharif were a couple of
short-sighted politicians interested primarily in lining their
pockets. But given the interventionist zeal of the military-
bureaucratic oligarchy, even figures better than them would have
had a hard time making a success of democracy.

The pity of it is that even after so much devastation the oligarchs
will not let go. Still determined to control the march of political
events, they have learned no lessons from history. The only
difference is that whereas previously the mandarinate made and
unmade policy, it is now the corps commanders who are swept by the
illusion of having all the answers.

In war the record of the general staff has been at best
indifferent. Now it wants to refashion the peace and in so doing is
intervening in every aspect of national life from cricket and
hockey to the recasting of the Constitution. It is another aspect
of the past being revisited that the air is again full of talk of
Zia's constitutional amendments being re-enacted. Even in our
failures we refuse to be inventive.

Anywhere else versatility would be considered a good thing. With us
it has become a living curse. Earlier top mandarins went from job
to job, leaving confusion and mayhem in their wake. Now it is
generals trying their hands at different things.

Take the devolution plan which has led to more confusion across the
land than anything since the dissolution of the Sikh kingdom after
the death of the great Maharaja Ranjit Singh. If it was such a good
thing why did the military government not implement it first in
Islamabad before trying it on the rest of the country? For reasons
unknown Islamabad has been spared while the experiment rages
elsewhere. Knowing something of the authors of this plan I am not
surprised. It is hard to make out which is more frightening, their
naivete or their complacency?

Pakistan may not deserve much but it can do without these fresh
experiments upon its tired and harassed body.

<a name="anot">Another day, another atrocity</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

Earlier this week, this newspaper reported yet another atrocity
against Ahmadis. A mob of zealots in Sheikhupura district had been
goaded by mullahs from the Sipah-i-Sahaba and the Khatm-i-Nabuwat
parties to attack a peaceful group of Ahmadis watching a religious
TV transmission in their 'place of worship' which was burned down
by the frenzied mob.

As usually happens in such cases, those locked up (in 'protective
custody') were the victims, not the criminals. In fact, it is still
not clear whether the police have even registered a criminal case
against those instigating the fanatics and those who participated
in the attack. Apparently, what infuriated the worthies of
Syedwalla village was the fact that the Ahmadis were watching the
televised address of their spiritual leader, Mirza Tahir.

Ironically, the same issue of this newspaper carried a
clarification relating to the system of separate electorates:
according to a spokesman of the law ministry, no summary proposing
that the system of joint electorates be restored was being moved as
had been reported in a section of the press. In fact, I had read
this bit of happy news just a day earlier, and was preparing to
write a column welcoming this development. In my naivet, I had
assumed that this government was following up on its banning of a
couple of extremist religious parties by finally enfranchizing our
minorities who had been so cruelly marginalized by Zia and his
pernicious separation of the minorities from the mainstream.

Incidents like the recent one in Syedwalla are commonplace, and
invariably the perpetrators are never touched; indeed, they are
regarded as heroes protecting the faith. It is fortunate that none
of those attacked was killed; but even if there had been a
fatality, one can be sure the murderer would not have been arrested
by the police. Such is the state of security for our persecuted
minorities.

In the recently concluded local bodies elections, apart from the
blatant pressure tactics used by the establishment to ensure
'positive results' in certain constituencies, we had the odd
situation where minority candidates could not contest the seats of
nazim and naib nazim even in areas where they are in a majority.
Thus, Muslims will be running local governments in the few pockets
where Hindus or Christians outnumber them. The basis of this
travesty is the system of separate electorates. I was shocked and
saddened that Omar Asghar Khan, the minister for local bodies, who
supposedly presided over this exercise, did not raise a finger to
correct this gross injustice. I have long respected him for his
strong advocacy of the underprivileged, and had welcomed his
appointment. Alas, power seems to have diluted his sense of
justice, and he has opted to take the path of least resistance.

And what shall we say about Shahida Jamil, the minister for law and
justice? If her ministry has not moved a summary proposing the end
of the separate electorate system, should it not have done so? As
the minister for justice, should not Ms Jamil be concerned about
the deplorable state of our minorities, and do something to improve
it? At the end of the day, it is far easier to strike liberal
postures on Islamabad's cocktail circuit than in cabinet meetings.

I have long maintained that by disenfranchizing the minorities, we
have effectively removed whatever feeble protection the state of
Pakistan provides the disadvantaged. Since non-Muslims are barred
from voting for mainstream candidates and parties, they are in turn
ignored and neglected by them. And as the local MPs (and now the
local governments) see no electoral benefit in interceding with the
police and other minions of the state on behalf of the minorities,
this reality inevitably weakens their position in society.

Ahmadis are possibly in an even less enviable position than Hindu,
Christian and other non-Muslim citizens because they consider
themselves Muslims. Without wishing to get into the rights and
wrongs of this debate, I can only express my outrage over the fact
that these unfortunate people are legally persecuted even for
reciting verses or phrases from the Holy Book. Ironically, we are
delighted when a (white) foreigner is able to say "Assalam
Walaikum." Scores of Ahmadis are rotting in jails around the
country for having committed this 'crime.'

Our record for human rights, never very bright, has been further
tarnished because of our inhumane treatment of the Ahmadis of which
the recent violence in syedwalla is only one relatively mild
example. Organizations like Amnesty International and the Human
rights Commissions regularly document and highlight these
transgressions against internationally accepted norms.

Earlier in its tenure, this government had made some refreshingly
liberal noises that led the optimists among us to assume that it
meant what it said, and that religious extremism would no longer be
officially encouraged. But a spate of sectarian killings soon
belied this expectation. Even the recent arrests of activists from
extremist parties proved to be no more than a stage-managed
showpiece as most of them were soon released. Similarly, the 'ban'
on fund-raising by jihadi outfits was illusory as these groups have
openly defied this edict. It is this kind of backtracking that has
emboldened these small but well-organized and armed gangs. Both
politicians and generals have repeatedly demonstrated a distinct
yellow streak when it comes to facing their responsibility and
putting a stop to the sectarian violence that is destabilizing the
country. The basic problem, of course, is that these very armed and
dangerous groups are being used to further the establishment's
agendas in Afghanistan and Kashmir.

Our rulers refuse to comprehend the basic truth that religious
extremism is not divisible: we cannot have sectarian peace and
quiet at home while exporting violence beyond our borders. By
permitting training camps to function, millions to be collected and
volunteers to cross our borders, the government is viewed - both
internally and externally - as encouraging and strengthening
extremist elements. Whether the activities of these groups is
called 'terrorism' or 'jihad' is a matter of semantics: it matters
little to the families of those killed and wounded by their
actions.

It is high time our rulers and our citizens understood that until
we draw a line and take tough action against those persecuting
Ahmadis, those gunning down Shias in Pakistan or Hindus in Kashmir,
all of us are at risk from the growing menace of intolerance and
sectarian violence. General Musharraf has shown that he can talk
the talk. But he has yet to demonstrate that he can walk the walk.

<a name="crus">Pakistan crush Bangladesh: Dream comeback by Kaneria</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

MULTAN, Aug 31: Danish Kaneria completed a dream comeback when he
bagged a match haul of 12 for 94 as Pakistan sent minnows
Bangladesh spinning to defeat by an innings and 264 runs well
inside three days of the Asian Test Championship opener remaining
at the Multan Cricket Stadium.

He claimed six for 42 in the first innings, followed up with six
for 52 in the second as Bangladesh were bundled out for 148 some 45
minutes before an extended first session of the third day. The
newest Test nation had resumed this morning at 55 for three and
required 412 to make the reigning champions bat again.

The victory margin was also the sixth biggest in the 122-year-old
history of Test cricket and second largest since the West Indies
beat New Zealand by an innings and 322 runs at Wellington in 1995.
Pakistan had also equaled Australia's world record of five
centuries in an innings in this Test when Saeed Anwar, debutant
Taufiq Umer, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Yousuf Youhana and Abdur Razzaq reach
three figures.

Waqar Younis' promise of securing maximum points was also fulfilled
when Pakistan collected 24 points - 16 on the basis of an innings
win and four each for bowling and batting.

Pakistan equal world record with 5 centuries
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

MULTAN, Aug 30: Pakistan equaled the world record of five centuries
in an innings as the home batsmen continued to enjoy the run feast
in the Asian Test Championship opener against minnows Bangladesh at
the Multan Cricket Stadium.

Centuries by Saeed Anwar (101), debutant Taufiq Umer (104),
Inzamam-ul-Haq (105), Yousuf Youhana (102) and Abdur Razzaq (110)
carried Pakistan from an overnight 219 for two to 546 for three
declared in reply to Bangladesh's modest 134.

Bangladesh, left to play for pride after trailing the home team by
412 runs on first innings, had limped to 55 for three when curtains
were drawn for the second day's play.

Pakistan secured maximum batting (four) and bowling (four) points
awarded on the first 100 overs of the first innings while
Bangladesh failed to get any. An expected victory by an innings
would earn Pakistan 16 more points.

Pakistan equalled Australia's 46-year-old record when five of their
batsmen scored centuries in the 1954-55 Test against the West
Indies at Kingston, Jamaica. Had Pakistan skipper Waqar Younis not
declared immediately after the 27-year-old Youhana guided Mohammad
Sharif towards third man boundary to bring up his seventh century
in 34th Test, Pakistan might have gone on to establish a new
record.

Around 15,000 festive and appreciative spectators had their money
worth when they were thoroughly entertained by high quality and
ruthless batting display by the elegant Pakistanis against a
pedestrian, inexperienced and mediocre Bangladesh bowling
resources. However, local hero Inzamam was not that fortunate when
he had to retire hurt because of dehydration a ball after
completing his 15th Test century in 75th Test. But Inzamam's return
to the dressing room piled up more agony on the tourists as Abdur
Razzaq virtually blew them away with a whirlwind unbeaten century.
The batting all-rounder scored 110 off 100 balls with 16 boundaries
and three sixes during his 124-minute vigil at the crease.

Razzaq, who came when Youhana was batting on 60, raced to 70
against Youhana's 77 at tea in Pakistan's 478 for three before
registering his second career century off 92 balls with 14
boundaries and three sixes.

It was the second quickest century by a Pakistani after Majid Khan
whipped a 74-ball century before lunch against New Zealand at
Karachi in 1976-77. Sir Vivian Richards holds the record for
quickest century when he reached three figures off just 56 balls
against England at St John's in 1985-86.

Youhana was as elegant as ever and remained cool and composed
despite watching Razzaq murder the Bangladesh bowlers from the
other end. His innings contained 13 exquisitely timed boundaries
from 154 balls faced during 220 minutes of batting.

Youhana and Razzaq added 165 runs in 124 minutes after the former
and Inzamam had put on 123 in 116 minutes. Inzamam and Taufiq Umer
put on 80 in 88 minutes for the third wicket.

Inzamam, the 31-year-old burly right-hander, fulfilled his promise
of enthralling his home crowd when he laced his 105-ball innings
with 15 boundaries and a six. Inzamam now has century against every
country except South Africa and India.

Interestingly, it was Inzamam's fourth century only on home turf.
The other notable point is that 11 of his centuries have come in
the crucial first innings while eight centuries have helped
Pakistan win Tests.

On a record-breaking day, Taufiq Umer became the eighth Pakistan
batsman after Khalid Ibadullah, Javed Miandad, Salim Malik,
Mohammad Wasim, Ali Naqvi, Azhar Mahmood and Younis Khan to score
century on debut. He had started the day at 77 and was the only
Pakistan wicket to fall when he was caught at the wicket after an
attractive 104.

Taufiq, the 20-year-old from Lahore, now has five first-class
centuries in 33 matches. He batted for 231 minutes and punctuated
15 boundaries in his 163-ball innings.

Taufiq showed excellent temperament, concentration and showed no
signs of nervousness when he stayed in the 90s for 19 balls,
including 13 balls on 96.  Unfortunately, his brilliant effort fell
in the background after Pakistan stroke-makers went on a run-
scoring spree.

<a name="bang">Bangladesh in trouble as Kaneria and Taufiq excel</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

MULTAN, Aug 29: Right arm leg spinner Danish Kaneria, debutant
Taufiq Umer and veteran Saeed Anwar shared limelight on the opening
day as Bangladesh found out the harsh realities of top level
cricket in the Asian Test Championship opener at the Multan Cricket
Stadium.

The 20-year-old Danish, playing his third Test, captured six for 42
- his Test best figures - to help Pakistan spin out Bangladesh for
a paltry 134 some 40 minutes before tea. Later, 20-year-old left-
handed opener Taufiq Umer carried on his fine form by celebrating
his Test debut with a strokeful and attractive unbeaten 77 as
Pakistan finished the opening day's play at a healthy 219 for two
from 46 overs, a lead of 85 with eight wickets in hand.

Veteran Saeed Anwar also had reasons to smile on a hot and humid
day when he became the sixth Pakistan batsman to complete 4,000
Test runs while reaching 49 on way to a scoring a fluent almost
run-a-ball 101. It was his 11th century and first in 11 innings
from seven Tests. His last was against Sri Lanka in Galle last
year.

Saeed, the 33-year-old playing his 55th Test, smashed 17 blistering
boundaries and a six before falling to 16-year-old Mohammad Sharif.
Trying once too often to play his elegant wristy on-drive, the
enigmatic former captain, was caught at square leg by Hasibul
Hossain.

Faisal Iqbal failed to take advantage of heaven sent opportunity of
getting some runs under his belt. The 19-year-old was bowled by
Sharif to a delivery that kept low and crashed onto the stumps
after taking the inside edge of the bat.

Danish bowled exceptionally well and pushed the ball in the air
while picking up his wickets in just 13 overs. He was devastating,
mean and bowled with purpose.

The leg spinner got the ideal start which a wrist spinner wants to
apply the pressure and pick the line as early as possible. An over-
pitched delivery was belted by opener Mehrab Hossain but Faisal
Iqbal picked up an extraordinary reflex action catch at silly
point. Catches like this are not seen too often and only shows the
brilliant reflexes Faisal has. From then on, there was no stopping
Danish as he mixed up his deliveries intelligently and spun the
ball from the right areas.

Off-spinner Shoaib Malik, who also earned a Test cap, picked up two
cheap wickets while Waqar Younis who made the early breaks
accounted for two. Wasim Akram remained wicket less in his 10 overs
but he should consider himself unlucky when Saeed dropped a waist-
high catch in the first slip. The former captain, who was as mean
as ever, could have been a different bowler had Saeed not showed
greasy palms.

Taufiq Umer, who stroked a masterly 113 against the same side in
the three-dayer, matched Saeed Anwar with stroke by stroke.

The trademark of Taufiq's innings was his ability to stroke
boundaries in front of the wickets. Bulk of his 11 boundaries were
either straight or through the covers as he fully cashed in on the
half volleys and over-pitched stuff hurled by the tourists.

Taufiq was as confident against pacers as against the slow bowlers
when he worked them around to maintain the flow or runs. His also
displayed his hunger for big innings when he became cautious after
reaching his half century from 55 balls with nine boundaries. At
stumps, he had faced 123 deliveries and looks well poised to become
the eighth Pakistani to score a century on debut.

<a name="imra">Imran urges ICC to penalize India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Representative

MULTAN, Aug 30: Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan demanded the
International Cricket Council (ICC) to impose sanctions on India
after they withdrew from the Asian Test Championship.

"The ICC should penalize India for not honouring the commitment,"
the legendary Khan said from Islamabad.

The Asiad was left in a spin by India when it withdrew two weeks
before the commencement of the championship citing security fears
and political hassles. However, the event manager decided to go
ahead with the tournament.

"Had they not confirmed participation, it would have been a
different issue. But withdrawing two weeks back is a serious crime
and it should not go unnoticed. The ICC should impose penalty on
India for breaking the commitment," Imran, who led Pakistan to the
World Cup glory at Melbourne in 1992, said.

"I am perplexed as India has no problems playing Pakistan in any
other sport except cricket. I am sure there is some other reason
behind," he said with reference to India's acceptance to send a
350-athlete contingent for October's SAF Games in Islamabad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 26: Age proved to be catching on the two veteran Jahan
brothers - Zarak and Zubair - when they failed to reach the next
qualifying round of the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) squash
championship at the Roshan Khan/Jahangir Khan squash complex here
Sunday.

Zarak was outgunned by rising Shamsul Islam Khan 15-10 15-4 15-10
while his sibling lost out to Egyptian Wael El Hindi in 15-11 15-8
15-7 in just 25 minutes.

Another upset result of the day was the ouster of talented
youngster Zubair Ali Khan who crashed out to Malaysian Mohammad
Azlan Iskander after a putting up a challenging fight.

Zubair, ranked 139 in the world, secured the first game from
Iskander, ranked 59, at 15-11 before the Malaysian came roaring
back at the Pakistani to first draw level at 15-6 and then surge to
a 2-1 lead by winning the third game at 15-14.

Zubair managed to level the games at 2-all by winning the fourth
game at 15-8. But in the meantime, ran out of gas as the Malaysian
virtually toyed with him before winning the game at 15-1.

In yet another interesting duel, Mohammad Ilyas beat a fighting
Naseem Takhali 15-5, 15-12 4-15 15-14.

<a name="leth">Lethargy of PFF exposed again</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shazad Ali

KARACHI, Aug 26: Pakistan has been forced to skip the Asian Under-
14 football championship because of the non-existence of a squad -
another proof of lethargy of the Pakistan Football Federation
(PFF).

Although a PFF official claimed that it was due to scarcity of time
for the preparations that Pakistan won't participate, the prime
reason behind the decision of backing out from the tournament is
not having an Under-14 squad.

"We received the invitation on Aug 22 from our Bangladeshi
counterparts. But we have no time to raise and prepare a formidable
team for the tournament. Therefore, we have decided against
participating in the event," secretary of the PFF, Agha Liaquat,
said from Lahore.
