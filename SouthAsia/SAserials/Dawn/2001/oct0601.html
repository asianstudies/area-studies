<a name="isla">Islamabad has valid concern</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 5: British Prime Minister Tony Blair made a firm
commitment to address Pakistan's political concerns in the post-
Taliban setup in Kabul and to extend all possible cooperation to
solve Islamabad's economic problems.

"If the current Taliban regime fails to yield up Osama bin Laden
and his associates then it must fall, and its successors must be a
broad-based government with every key ethnic group, including
Pushtoon, represented in it," Mr Blair told reporters at a joint
press conference with President Pervez Musharraf.

The prime minister appreciated Pakistan's political interests in
Afghanistan, saying Islamabad had valid interests and close
involvement in any future arrangement in Kabul. Mr Blair, who
arrived here from Moscow, stressed the inclusion of Pushtoons, a
dominant ethnic group in Afghanistan, in the proposed broad-based
government was extremely important. He said that if the Taliban
failed to hand over Osama and his associates then they would be
considered the people shielding terrorists and a legitimate enemy.

Britain, Mr Blair said, would restore defence cooperation with
Pakistan and also help in working out a new IMF programme.
Pakistan, he noted, had already successfully completed first phase
of its IMF programme. "In addition, we will support strongly the
trade cooperation agreement with the European Union due to be
finalized on Monday," he said, adding they would also help
Islamabad in issues like debt in the context of the new IMF
package. "We and other countries will provide the necessary
resources to help Pakistan cope with the refugee problem," he said,
announcing a $40 million relief package for Afghan refugees and
another $15 million for the host country for supporting refugees.

Tracing the history of the relations between the people of two
countries, he said: "Now is the time to use our past and present
friendship to help resolve the current crisis in the interest of
people of not only this region but the whole world."

MUSHARRAF: President Musharraf in his brief remarks said the focus
of their two-hour discussion remained on Afghanistan. He said his
government was convinced that there was evidence showing a link
between the terrorist acts and Osama. "However, we are not standing
here in judgment on the details of the evidence," he said.

<a name="evid">Evidence enough to indict Osama: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 4: Government said that the evidence provided by the
United States against Osama bin Laden was sufficient to indict him
in a court of law. "We have seen the material that was provided to
us by the American side yesterday," Foreign Office spokesman Riaz
Muhammad Khan told reporters at his briefing about the evidence
that Islamabad said was received on Wednesday.

The investigations against Osama bin Laden were still continuing
and Islamabad expected that the evidence shared with it would be
supplemented by additional material, he said. Asked whether the
material was related to the Sept 11 terror attacks on the World
Trade Center and Pentagon, or to the bombing of the US embassies in
Tanzania and Nairobi, the spokesman said it related to both
incidents.

As regards the question of sharing the proof with the international
community, he said they had not been requested to share the
evidence with anybody. "It is for the US to exercise its judgment
on this question." However, he observed, the case of Washington in
taking action against those responsible for the terrorist acts
would be strengthened if this evidence was publicized.

He noted that certain sensitivities were involved with regard to
confidentiality of the evidence and that it should be a US decision
as to what extent it could be shared or whether they could go to
the extent of publicizing it. He said they had not been asked to
approach Taliban, adding it was for the United States and Taliban
to get in touch with each other regarding the evidence against
Osama.

He said the evidence shared by the United States had no reference
of the Al Rasheed Trust (ART) whose accounts had been frozen by the
government following a determination by the US that the trust, with
26 other organizations, had been a source of funds for Osama and
his Al Qaida group.

The spokesman said the government had asked the US administration
to provide evidence against ART, which, it believed, was primarily
a charity organization working for the welfare of Afghan refugees.
In reply to a question about the influx of Afghan refugees, he said
there were reports that around 800 people crossed over to Pakistan
daily. The established entry points, he pointed out, were lying
closed.

There was a tremendous pressure on Pakistan's western borders and
hundreds of thousands of people were pressing to enter the country,
he added. In reply to a question about foreign nationals,
particularly Arabs, the spokesman said the government was checking
credentials of all the expatriates working with the NGOs.

He said it was part of the restrictive visa policy and added that
issuance of visa at the airports on arrivals had been stopped. All
visa applications were now accepted only by Pakistani missions to
be referred to Islamabad for clearance, he said.

Agencies add: "There are sufficient grounds for indictment and it
reinforces the resolutions of the Security Council taken earlier,"
the spokesman said, referring to the United Nations sanctions
slapped on the Taliban in 1999 and 2001 for their refusal to hand
over Osama to the United States or a third country. He said
Pakistan had not been asked to share the material with the Taliban
and it would not do so. "Pakistan is not talking to the Taliban on
behalf of any other country or persons."

<a name="uswe">US welcomes statement on evidence</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Oct 5: The United States has welcomed Pakistan's
statement that Islamabad considers the evidence provided to it by
Washington to be sufficient to indict Osama bin Laden.

State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said at his afternoon
briefing: "We certainly welcome the announcement by the Pakistani
foreign ministry spokesman that Pakistan believes that there is
sufficient evidence to indict Osama bin Laden's organization for
the Sept 11 terror attacks. Pakistan has stated its intention to
work for a broad-based and representative government in
Afghanistan, and we share that goal as well."

Mr Boucher added: "We are confident that Pakistan will fulfil its
commitments as a key member of the global coalition against
terrorism. We are continuing our consultations on how best to wage
the campaign against terrorism, as we are doing with many other
countries involved in the international coalition."

Pakistan has become the first Muslim country to accept that the US
has credible evidence implicating Osama and Al Qaida in the Sept 11
attacks, and reports here on Friday said Islamabad's statement
should help to rally other Islamic states to fully join the
coalition. Mr Boucher refused to be drawn into discussing the word
"indictment" used in the Pakistani statement and whether this meant
that Pakistan could try Osama in a Pakistani court.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Oct 1: Mulla Omar warned that the Taliban would retreat
to the mountains and wage a long war against the former Afghan
monarch if the Taliban government was toppled in the event of an
attack on Afghanistan.

"Taliban are an organized force. Theirs is not a government like
that of Zahir Shah whose government was toppled and his forces
surrendered before another authority. If the Taliban government is
toppled, they would retreat to the mountains. How will he rule
then? How will he survive? Don't ruin yourself, don't drown
yourself," the Taliban supreme leader said in a radio address to
the nation.

In what is seen as the most direct and stinging attack on the
former king, Zahir Shah, who lives in self-exile in Rome since his
government was toppled by his cousin Sardar Muhammad Daud in 1973,
Mulla Omar warned: "Don't be mistaken, people will come after you
and kill you."

-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, Oct 1: President Pervez Musharraf said that the days of the
Taliban appeared numbered, saying he was "re-evaluating" ties with
the militia.

In an interview on BBC World Service radio, he said Pakistan was
trying to "interact" with the Taliban rather than "save" them.

Asked if the Taliban's days were numbered, he said: "It appears so.
It appears that the United States will take action in Afghanistan,
and we have conveyed this to the Taliban... that was the reason we
were interacting with them so that some moderation takes place and
maybe this kind of action is averted," he said. "But it appears
that because of the stand that the Taliban have taken that
confrontation will take place."-Agencies

<a name="aske">Islamabad asked not to act as kingmaker</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
JABAL SERAJ, Oct 5: The Afghanistan's Northern Alliance warned
Pakistan not to try and influence the leadership of the country in
a post-Taliban scenario and played down suggestions that the former
king should take up the reins as head of state.

Since the September 11 terror attacks on New York and Washington,
blamed on Osama bin Laden, former king Zahir Shah has been at the
centre of efforts to replace the Taliban regime. On Monday, he
forged a deal with Afghan opposition groups to form a supreme
council that would elect a head of state and transitional
government if the Taliban fell.

President Pervez Musharraf has also written to the Rome-based ex-
monarch requesting the urgent dispatch of an envoy to Islamabad for
talks on the political future of Afghanistan. Dr Abdullah Abdullah,
chief spokesman for the opposition Northern Alliance, said that he
expected the council would convene in opposition-held territory in
the next 10 days. But Dr Abdullah was keen to play down suggestions
that the council could result in the election of the 86-year-old
Zahir Shah as the next head of state.

Dr Abdullah also criticized Musharraf's request for Zahir Shah to
send an envoy to Islamabad. "If countries in the region have to get
involved, six plus two is the best formula," he said - referring to
Afghanistan's six neighbouring countries, plus the United States
and Russia.-AFP

<a name="ties">Ties with Kabul can't be cut: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Oct 1: Pakistan cannot sever its diplomatic relations
with Afghanistan and cannot afford the "luxury of insulating"
itself from Kabul. Foreign Office spokesman Riaz Mohammad Khan
stated that this isolation would amount to "strangulation" of the
people of Afghanistan who always depended on Pakistan for their
transit trade, food supplies, etc.

Asked what was the good of having relations with Afghanistan when
Kabul had declined to cooperate with Islamabad on the Osama bin
Laden issue, the spokesman said that if Islamabad had no contacts
with Kabul, and if no food reached Afghanistan then it would mean
that tens of thousands of Afghans would be pouring into Pakistan
adding to the millions of those already living in refugee camps.
"The contacts that we have maintained are dictated by geographical
compulsions" and were not "purely academic" as in case of most of
the countries, he explained.

One should ponder, the spokesman suggested, over the consequences
if these relations were to be severed. Most of the humanitarian and
United Nations agencies, he reminded, had been operating in
Afghanistan from Pakistan. Even during the last couple of days, he
recalled, the UN under-secretary responsible for humanitarian
affairs had come here to meet the Taliban ambassador in Islamabad
to seek assistance for supply of the World Food Programme
consignments to Afghanistan. They had requested for Pakistan's
assistance as well, he added.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 3: President Gen Pervez Musharraf told the joint
meeting of the National Security Council and the federal cabinet
that no war was intended against Afghanistan
and that the actions being contemplated by certain countries were
targeted against terrorists and those who provide sanctuary to
terrorists.

Referring to the current crisis in the region, he, however, said
that Pakistan would like to set its own course directed by
considerations of national interests and the principles of the
United Nations Charter. He was confident that both Pakistan and
Afghanistan will emerge stronger out of this situation.

He said that national interest was the only constant factor in
inter-state relations as policies change to protect the national
interest against a continuously changing international environment.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Oct 2: Pakistan renounced speculations that it has
received a formal demand from the United States for allowing six
air force bases for launching attack on Afghanistan.

Major-General Rashid Qureshi, chief spokesman for the government of
Pakistan, told Dawn that the US Ambassador Wendy Chamberlin during
her meeting with the president had raised no such demand.

Gen Qureshi, who was in Peshawar on Tuesday, said that there was no
truth in the speculations that Pakistan has acceded to the US
demand for providing six PAF bases - Peshawar, Quetta, Shamzi,
Rajanpur, Kohat and Shahbaz.

He said that Pakistan has so far maintained borderline stand with
regards to allowing US troops to use Pakistan soil for hitting
targets inside Afghanistan. It has also made it clear that
Pakistani troops would not take part in any offensive in
Afghanistan.

<a name="1000">1,000 troops leave for Uzbekistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
TASHKENT, Oct 5: Some 1,000 US elite troops are en route to
Uzbekistan in the first major deployment of US ground forces in the
showdown with Afghanistan, an official travelling with US Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said.

"The 10th mountain division is in the air," the official told
reporters travelling with Rumsfeld, who flew into Tashkent from
Cairo. The 10th mountain division, which specializes in cold-
weather fighting, could also be used as a rapid-reaction force to
back up special forces' missions in Afghanistan, the Washington
Post reported earlier this week. US troops have held military
exercises in former Soviet republics before, but never for an
operation of this kind.

US warships and bombers are positioned within striking distance of
Afghanistan and US special forces have been deployed to the region.
But except for some 2,200 combat-ready US Marines aboard amphibious
assault ships in waters off Pakistan, no large contingents of
ground forces had moved until now.

The Uzbeks could also be a valuable source of much-needed
intelligence on Afghanistan's ruling Taliban and the activities of
Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network.-AFP

<a name="whot">WHO to investigate spread of disease</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 4: The World Health Organisation, the National
Institute of Health and the provincial health authorities of
Balochistan will start investigations into the reports about the
outbreak of Crimean Congo Haemmoraghic Fever (CCHF) in Quetta.

Speaking at a press conference, the United Nations Information
centre director, Eric Falt, said that 40 cases of the CCHF were
detected in different parts of the country earlier during the
months of May to August. At least 11 persons are known to have died
from the disease during this time period, he said, adding, the
cases were reported by Pakistan's health authorities and
substantiated by the WHO.

Director UNIC said that the first case of CCHF was detected in May
and the last was reported in August. "The disease is not new in
Pakistan and has affected people from Quetta to Karachi in the
past." The disease spreads through bite of ticks and affects the
human population, he said.

About the authenticity of the reports that CCHF, labelled as "Ebola
like virus," has spread in Quetta, Mr Falt said that the Quetta
based WHO officials have not confirmed new cases and a fact finding
mission will be leaving for the city. The citizens should not draw
any conclusions until the reports are confirmed, he said.

The medical teams being dispatched to Quetta are to monitor
people's health and immediately screen anybody who might harbour
symptoms of the disease. According to UN officials, the CCHF is
said to be "Ebola like" which itself is a highly contagious and
often fatal form of Viral Haemmoraghic Fever.

Doctors told Dawn that in Pakistan the disease has been reported in
Afghan nationals and refugees. Earlier this year, two cases of
Congo Fever were brought to Shifa International Hospital Islamabad
who later expired. The doctors and paramedic staff dealing with the
cases were also affected because of the highly contagious nature of
the disease, but since infection in the doctors was detected early,
they survived, doctors said, adding similar cases were detected in
other parts of the country.

<a name="paki">Pakistan warned of biological attack</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Baqir Sajjad Syed

ISLAMABAD, Sept 30: The United States has warned Pakistan of
possible biological warfare and attacks by terrorists and asked it
to prepare contingency plans to check it, highly-placed sources
told Dawn.

Following the US alert, the authorities were preparing contingency
plans for the unusual mode of attack and had reportedly sought $1
million assistance from the US for upgrading their facilities, the
sources said.

The sources said there were reports that the terrorists might
unleash attacks by biological weapons in Pakistan in response to
the US attack on alleged terrorist bases run by Al-Qaida of Osama
bin Laden in Afghanistan.

Pakistan's two defence laboratories - one in Karachi and the other
in Islamabad - were working to prepare the vaccine to combat
biological agents, the sources said, adding that the existing
facilities would need to be upgraded for properly coping with such
an attack. The country had the required expertise to prepare
vaccine for biological agents and if funds were provided the
vaccine could be made available in days, the sources said. Under
the plan two mobile self-contained micro-biology laboratories would
be established, they added.

The authorities said they would also be looking forward to the WHO
for technological assistance in preparing a defence against
biological weapons.

International agencies, meanwhile, have expressed reservations
about Pakistan's ability to cope with such an attack. The vaccine
available with international agencies would not be enough to
provide coverage to the people in the event of an attack by
biological agents, the sources disclosed.

Officials of the National Crisis Management Team said the
authorities were making all possible arrangements to combat such a
threat.

<a name="noex">No extremism in army: CE: Nuclear weapons in safe hands</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Sept 30: President Gen Pervez Musharraf has said that
Pakistan's nuclear weapons are extremely safe and there are no
extremists within the armed forces who could try to seize control
of them in the current crisis.

"I am very, very sure that the command and control setup that we
have evolved for ourselves is very, very secure," Musharraf said in
an interview with CNN here on Sunday.

The president dismissed concerns that elements within the armed
forces were sympathetic to the Taliban regime and might try to make
a grab for control of nuclear weapons. "There is no chance of these
assets falling into the hands of extremists," Musharraf said.

The army is the most disciplined army in the world and there is no
chance of any extremism coming into the army. "We have an excellent
command system. We have excellent traditions, and I don't see this
doomsday scenario ever appearing," the president added.

The president insisted that those opposing his decision of
extending cooperation to the world community against terrorism were
a handful of religious extremists while the entire nation was
behind him.

When asked whether he had not taken a huge risk for his government
by siding with the world community, the president dismissed fears
that his government might fall as a result of his decision.

When asked why out of the entire Muslim world only Pakistan had
been singled out to become a frontline state in war against
terrorism, the president said we had put this question to the
United States and we were also in the process of getting other
Muslim states along which have already announced their full support
to the world community. He mentioned Oct 8 OIC foreign ministers
conference as one step in that direction.

Gen Musharraf was positive when asked if Pakistan would afford to
provide airspace facility to the allied forces when they make air
strikes on Afghanistan. He said: "We have been asked to provide
intelligence services, airspace facility and also logistics but we
need to get into modalities as they come along."

The president, however, added: "I would not like that Pakistani
troops enter into Afghanistan." "We don't know anything about the
operational plan as yet," Musharraf said.

He did not agree with the reports that thousands of US troops have
already landed in Pakistan and said: "I have no such information
and I am certainly clear that no one is based in Pakistan."

To a question about Osama bin Laden, President Musharraf said we
have no evidence as none is shared by the US with us. "There is no
evidence that has been shared with us as yet," he said. "I really
don't know what is the confidential part of this evidence.

"If there is confidentiality in it, in the interest of justice, we
certainly would understand that. But those parts which would
facilitate a better understanding of the people at large should be
shared."

When asked whether he expected any flexibility in the attitude of
the Taliban militia as a result of his government's efforts
including two missions already sent, the president said: "Hopes are
very dim that the Taliban would meet US demands to hand over Osama
bin Laden. The signals that come out are not very encouraging."

To a question about potential support to the Northern Alliance, the
president said: "We are interested in peace in Afghanistan as we
are interested in a government there which is interested in a
moderate, united Afghanistan." He said that Pakistan was the only
state with diplomatic ties with Kabul regime and we continue to
interact with them as due to our interaction we have been able to
put forth the view of our government and the international concerns
about terrorism and got their stand flexible with the ulema's
decree.

Replying to a question about the religious institutions and fears
of terrorist training attached to them, the president said: "We
have some 6,000 Madrassa most of them imparting religious education
but there is no real evidence of training in militancy by anyone of
them. Mind you, these Madaris were public welfare institutions in
real terms as they impart free education to thousands of students,
provide them with shelter and boarding facilities," the president
added.

He, however, stated with clarity that government was determined to
weed out terrorists activities from the country. He said Harkatul
Mujahideen whose accounts were frozen in the US and Pakistan had no
offices in the country for it was operating inside held Kashmir.

When questioned about possible economic benefits that his
government expected in lieu of its cooperation to the US, President
Musharraf said: "It is not a deal and what is going on is not a
result of it."

He said we were faced with difficulties after becoming frontline
state and "do expect that the US would consider our difficulties".

The president said he has the support of "the entire people of
Pakistan," except for the religious extremists - who have extremist
views - "but, they are in minority." He said Pakistanis could be
bracketed in three categories: religious extremist minority, upper
class and lower middle class. The entire nation is convinced of the
response of the Pakistan government to combating of international
terrorism, he added.

Responding to the question whether he was still committed to taking
the country back on democratic rails, President Musharraf
unequivocally said: "I shall remain committed to the nation in my
pledge to returning to democratic rule and have clearly laid down
the same by announcing a roadmap."

<a name="nati">National interests surrendered: PML</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 3: Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) expressed deep
concern over the reports that the military regime has been
discussing with the United States possible American assistance for
the security of Pakistan's nuclear installations.

In a statement issued here, the PML spokesman said that the move
amounted to compromising Pakistan's most vital security interests.
The spokesman said it was expected that the reports, emanating from
Washington, would be contradicted or at least a plausible
clarification would be issued from Islamabad. "However, continued
silence of the official spokesman has strengthened the suspicion
that the military rulers have completely surrendered the national
interests before the global hegemonic interests of the US," he
alleged.

The spokesman said that the reports, carried by the national press,
clearly stated that the top-level US military team visiting
Islamabad last week "discussed possible US help to Pakistan to
provide equipment and other assistance for improving security and
installing new safeguards on Pakistan's nuclear weapons and at its
nuclear power plants."

The PML spokesman said it was an open secret that the US had all
along been deadly against development of nuclear deterrent
capability by Pakistan and the country had to suffer harsh economic
sanctions for 11 years due to its nuclear program. "How could then
the Americans be entrusted with providing protection to our nuclear
installations," the spokesman asked.

<a name="usmo">US move to suspend democracy sanctions</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Mirza

WASHINGTON, Oct 4: The Senate foreign relations committee
unanimously approved a draft bill for Congressional approval that
would enable President George Bush to temporarily waive the
remaining sanctions against Pakistan.

The draft, which tailors the waivers to meet specific objectives
rather than give broad or sweeping waiver authority to the
president, has three significant elements. It proposes vesting the
president with the authority to waive democracy sanctions under
Section 508; it also seeks to invest the president with the
authority to waive, in the interests of national security,
sanctions imposed under the Missile Technology Control Regime
(MTCR) and to be able to do without the 45-day notification period
required for mandatory prior intimation to Congress; and it
recommends to do away with the 30-day period necessary under the
Brooke amendment for approval of rescheduling of loans.

Present MTCR restrictions apply to Pakistan's defence ministry and
Suparco, and the bill should provide additional flexibility to the
Bush administration in extending military assistance to Islamabad.

The waiver of the remaining sanctions on Pakistan was widely
expected after the waivers given last month on nuclear-related
prohibitions on both India and Pakistan. The move has strong
support in Congress, with both Senator Joseph Biden, chairman of
the foreign relations committee, and Senator Sam Brownback, who is
the mover of the present bill, publicly advocating the waiver of
all sanctions.

Senator Biden in his opening remarks at the foreign relations
committee meeting on Thursday said democracy sanctions were
proposed to be waived for fiscal year 2001, and could be waived the
next year also provided the president determined that doing so
would facilitate the transition to democratic rule in Pakistan and
if it was considered important in the fight against terrorism.

The senator said rather than providing the broad waiver sought by
the State Department, the committee had tailored legislation to
address the specific provisions of law that were obstacles to
helping Pakistan. Apart from Mr Biden and Mr Brownback, the bill is
sponsored by senators Jesse Helms, Mitch McConnel, Tim Johnson and
George Allen.

WASHINGTON, Sept 29: United States Senator Sam Brownback has

by waiving till September 30, 2003, existing legislation, reports a
website of PTI news agency.

The US' nuclear cooperation with Pakistan and India, however,
continued to be barred as per the provisions of the Bill.

The Bill, was co-sponsored by Senator Mitch Mcconnell. It
authorizes the President, George W Bush to provide for India and
Pakistan "assistance, enter into contracts, take actions in
international financial institutions, sell, lease or authorise the
export of defence articles or defence services, authorise the
export of dual use items or extend other financial assistance".

The only condition being it should be "in the national interest of
the United States and important to its efforts to respond to, deter
or prevent acts of international terrorism".

<a name="mili">Military aid likely as US Senate passes bill</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON, Oct 5: The Senate hurriedly passed legislation
suspending sanctions on Pakistan, a country the United States sees
as key to its efforts toward punishing those responsible for the
Sept 11 attack on the United States.

The Senate voted without debating the legislation, only hours after
the Foreign Relations Committee approved the measure. The unusually
quick pace reflected the urgency senators and the Bush
administration attached to the bill.

The legislation still must be considered by the House. US military
and economic aid to Pakistan has been interrupted for several years
to punish Islamabad for testing nuclear weapons and for the 1999
military coup that replaced a democratically elected government.
Pakistan's arrears on debt to the United States, which recently was
rescheduled, also limited future US loan activity.

The legislation would allow President George W. Bush to initiate
military and other aid to Pakistan for the current fiscal year,
which began on Oct 1, and for the following year. Following the
Sept 11 attack on the United States that left at least 5,700 people
dead or missing, Pakistan's military leader indicated a willingness
to cooperate with US attempts to apprehend Osama bin Laden and his
associates.

Using his executive powers, Bush recently announced some new aid
for Pakistan. But legislation is required to carry out a wider
range of US assistance to Pakistan. The Senate-passed bill arrived
on the floor Thursday with solid bipartisan backing. Among
proponents of the legislation are Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, and Sen. Jesse Helms,
one of the most conservative Republicans serving in the Senate.

Before Biden's committee approved the bill Thursday, the chairman
warned Pakistan's military leaders the legislation should not be
viewed as a "green light" to cancel elections set for next fall or
to go ahead with further nuclear weapons tests.-Reuters

<a name="pmld">PML denies approving Osama's arrest plan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Oct 4: Pakistan Muslim League has contradicted a
Washington Post report alleging that Mian Nawaz Sharif, the then
prime minister, had approved a plan prepared by the then US
government to arrest Osama bin Laden.

In a PML central secretariat statement, a PML spokesman said that
the hypothetical report was based on "possibilities, assumptions
and unnamed sources". He said that prime minister Nawaz Sharif
always protected the national interest and represented the wishes
of the people.

The spokesman said that despite as many as five telephone calls
form the former US President Clinton, Nawaz Sharif declined to
accept his demand to forego nuclear tests in exchange for economic
aid and waiver of US sanctions. "He decided to explode six nuclear
devices to ensure independence and security of the country,
although it was a golden opportunity to procure economic assistance
and get the sanctions waived off," he added.

The spokesman pointed out that in a recent interview with CNN and
BBC Mr Clinton went on record with the admission, "I had issued
direction to kill or arrest Osama bin Laden but the then democratic
government refused to help me, while the present United States
government is getting cooperation from the Musharraf government."

He said it was on record that when the United States fired cruise
missiles on Afghanistan in August 1998, Prime Minister Muhammad
Nawaz Sharif had lodged a strong protest with Washington, making it
clear that attack on Afghanistan without permission from the
government of Pakistan was wrong.

<a name="noop">No operational plan yet: FO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, Oct 5: Pakistan said the US had not provided any
specific operational plan, but made it clear the sentiment was that
only those responsible for terrorism should be targeted and care
should be exercised to ensure that innocent people didn't suffer.

This was stated by Foreign Office spokesman Riaz Muhammad Khan in
reply to a question at the daily briefing. The spokesman said that
Indian external affairs minister Jaswant Singh's remarks that
Islamabad was part of the problem of terrorism and not part of a
solution were "no surprise".

"It is usual for them (Indian officials) to say such things," he
said in reply to a question. Mr Singh had made the remarks to the
BBC in the context of the Kashmir freedom struggle which India
blamed on Pakistan.

He said the struggle in held Kashmir was not terrorism but a fight
for the right of self-determination which had been going on for 54
years. Not only the international community recognized it as such
but wanted it to be resolved urgently through negotiations.
Pakistan, he said, was no den of terrorists, as alleged by India,
but a victim of terrorism in the 1980s for supporting the anti-
Soviet struggle in bordering Afghanistan and in the 1990s for
supporting the Kashmiris' freedom struggle.-Agencies

Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Oct 4: Former interior minister Chaudhry Shujaat Husain
does not know that the US Central Intelligence Agency had trained
some Pakistani commandos in 1999 to enter Afghanistan and capture
Osama bin Laden, as reported by an American paper.

"I don't know whether any such thing had happened. If at all any
plan had been prepared or the commandos had been sent to the US for
training, the interior ministry was not in the picture," he said
while talking to Dawn.

Mr Husain said had the commandos belonged to any institution other
than the army, the interior ministry must have known that they had
been sent abroad for training. He said the then prime minister
Nawaz Sharif had never discussed the Osama issue in any cabinet
meeting nor had he ever taken it up with him privately.

Had Mr Sharif ever done so, he said, he would have vehemently
opposed any plan to send Pakistani commandos to Afghanistan to
capture the Saudi dissident.

<a name="osam">Osama: CIA had trained Pakistani commandos</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Oct 3: The US Central Intelligence Agency had trained
some Pakistani commandos in 1999 to enter Afghanistan and capture
Osama bin Laden, but the plan was shelved when the Nawaz Sharif
government was displaced by the military.

The revelation is made in a story published by The Washington Post
under banner headlines. It says the operation was arranged by Nawaz
Sharif and his chief of intelligence with the Clinton
administration, which in turn had promised to lift sanctions on
Pakistan and provide an economic package  the precise steps that
the Bush administration is now undertaking following Islamabad's
pledge of support for the US-led campaign against terrorism.

Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage refused in a television
interview on Wednesday morning to comment on the Post story, saying
intelligence matters could not be discussed in public, but unnamed
administration officials were quoted as confirming the report.

The Post also said a proposal by Sudan in 1996 to arrest Osama, who
was then in that country, and deport him to Saudi Arabia had fallen
through after Riyadh refused to agree to accept Osama. Talking of a
record of "missed opportunities" in the drive against Osama and Al
Qaeda, the Post said the US-Pakistani intelligence plan was set in
motion less than 12 months after American Tomahawk missiles were
launched on Afghanistan. The Pakistani commando team trained by the
CIA "was up and running and ready to strike by October 1999",
according to one official, when the plan was aborted after the Oct
12 overthrow of the Sharif government by Gen Pervez Musharraf and
the army.

The Post says Gen Musharraf, who has now committed himself to back
the US, had refused to continue with the operation despite attempts
at persuasion by the Clinton administration.

It adds: "The record of the CIA's aborted relationship with
Pakistan two years ago illustrates the value - and the pitfalls -
of such an alliance in targeting bin Laden."

The paper says Pakistan and its intelligence services have valuable
information about what is occurring inside Afghanistan. "But a
former US official said joint operations with the Pakistani service
are always dicey, because the Taliban militia that rules most of
Afghanistan has penetrated Pakistani intelligence."

According to the Post, president Clinton's national security
adviser Samuel "Sandy" Berger says Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden
were the number one security threat to America after 1998 (the year
when, in August, 200 people were killed in bomb attacks at the US
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania). "It was the highest priority and
a range of appropriate actions were taken".

<a name="usre">US revising Pakistani, Indian entities' list</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Monitoring Desk

WASHINGTON, Sept 29: The Bush administration is revising its list
of Indian and Pakistani entities that were denied imports of US
dual-use technology after the two countries conducted nuclear tests
in May 1998, according to the IANS website.

The Commerce Department began the exercise after President W.
Bush's Sept 22 order, scrapping nuclear-related sanctions against
India and Pakistan. The waiver permits the lifting of the denial
policy currently in place in the Export Administration Regulations
(EAR) for NP (N-proliferation) - and MT (missile technology) -
control- led items to these countries.

The department's Export Administration has said that Bush has
waived the Glenn Amendment sanctions that applied to dual-use items
controlled for nuclear and missile reasons of the Arms Export
Control Act. Meanwhile, the State Department released a fact-sheet
containing a summary of the sanctions against India and Pakistan
that Bush has waived.

The Glenn Amendment sanctions, which have now ceased to exist,
prohibited assistance under the Foreign Assistance Act, US
government credit, credit guarantees and "other financial
assistance".

It had directed the US to "oppose" non-basic human needs loans,
financial or technical assistance through international financial
institutions, barred export licences for US Munitions List items
and certain dual-use items. It also prohibited government defence
sales.

The waiver will apply to certain sanctions that were imposed only
on Pakistan. These include Export-Import Bank guarantees and
insurance and credits to any non-nuclear weapons state that
detonates a nuclear device. Also waived is the Pakistan-specific
Pressler Amendment, which prohibited military assistance and
transfers of military equipment or technology unless the president
certifies that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear explosive
device.

Pakistan will also benefit from the US decision to scrap sanctions
under the Symington Amendment, which blocks economic assistance,
military assistance or international military education and
training (IMET), assistance for peacekeeping operations, or
military credits or guarantees to any country, which receives
nuclear enrichment equipment without safeguards from any other
country.

<a name="unal">UN allows use of force against terrorists</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, Sept 29: The United Nations Security Council
unanimously adopted a comprehensive anti-terrorism resolution which
authorizes use of force against terrorists and their political and
military supporters.

Invoking Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, the resolution makes it
mandatory on all 189 member states to crack down on the financing,
training and movement of terrorists.

In an unusually quick decision, the Security Council approved the
US-sponsored resolution in a 15-0 vote to underscore the unanimity
of spirit in the council to combat terrorism in the backdrop of
attacks on the US. It was adopted a day after it was introduced in
the council.

"This is an unprecedented resolution on terrorism in the work of
the United Nations," said John D. Negroponte, the United States
ambassador. It obliges all member states to deny financing, support
and safe haven to terrorists.

The main focus of the resolution is on the financing of clandestine
networks. It seeks to freeze assets of people who have committed,
or attempted to commit, terrorist acts or participated in groups
owned or controlled "directly or indirectly" by such people. The
resolution also requires countries to deny safe haven to anyone
responsible for or supporting a terrorist attack.

The diplomats also said many of the resolution's requirements would
require changes in national legal codes, such as those dealing with
border controls or policies on asylum.

Both the Security Council and the General Assembly quickly adopted
resolutions condemning the attacks and endorsing an American
response immediately after the US attacks.

The main features of the resolution are:

* "Prevent and suppress the financing of terrorists."

* "Freeze without delay" the resources of terrorists and terror
organizations, none were specifically cited.

* Prohibit anyone from making funds available to terrorist
organizations.

* Suppress the recruitment of new members by terrorist
organizations and eliminate their weapon supplies.

* "Deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support or commit
terrorist acts, or provide save havens."

* Afford one another the greatest measure of assistance" in
criminal investigations involving terrorism.

* "Prevent the movement of terrorists or terrorist groups by
effective border controls" and control over travel documents.

The diplomats here said that the resolution, could be interpreted
to open the way for the use of force against the radical Taliban
government of Afghanistan if it failed to "deny safe haven" to
terrorist groups.

It also called on all the states to report within 90 days on how
they were complying with the stipulations of the resolution.

The Palestinian hijackers had filed the petition last week but it
was not taken up. Now they have filed a fresh application, seeking
interim order as the situation is changing dramatically and they
fear that they would be handed over.

According to counsel for the hijackers, Advocate Tariq Asad,, the
application for interim order will be taken up on Tuesday by
Justice Javed Buttar of LHC, Rawalpindi bench.

The hijackers contended in their petition, that if they were to be
handed over to the USA, they should have been handed over in 1985.
When they have completed all the punishment for the crime, there
was no justification for handing them over to the USA for fresh
trial, they said.

WASHINGTON, Oct 4: President George Bush announced $320 million in

neighbouring states to help Afghan refugees. A major component of
the assistance, $295 million, will go to Afghans suffering from
drought, famine and displacement because of the threat of a US-led
strike against their country. But the step was also seen as part of
an effort to woo ordinary Afghans and isolate the Taliban regime
ahead of action against Osama bin Laden and Al Qaida bases.

The new aid, which will be channelled through the World Food
Program and voluntary organizations, was announced by President
George Bush during a visit to the State Department.

Two influential senators, Senator Joseph Biden (Democrat), chairman
of the foreign relations committee, and Senator Sam Brownback

<a name="cour">Court resummons witness in Wattoo corruption case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, Oct 1: An accountability court summoned a prosecution
witness for October 9 to provide certified documents from
procurement and purchase files of an plane in a corruption
reference against former Punjab chief minister Mian Manzoor Wattoo.

The defence counsel, Babar Awan advocate, representing Mr Wattoo,
requested the court to direct the prosecution witness, chief pilot
Qaiser Saleem, to provide certain documents from the record of the
case which was not available with the defence. The counsel also
cross-examined the witness after which the court, headed by judge
Rustam Ali Malik, adjourned the case for Oct 9.

Mian Wattoo, according to the prosecution misused his authority to
purchase a Beach Jet 400-A aircraft by utilizing the non-
developmental funds of the Punjab government. The aircraft was
allegedly purchased to favour Javaid A Zia of Air Hansen and Pak
General Aviation (Pvt) (PGAL) without disposing of the earlier
aircraft available with the Punjab government. He is also said to
have misused his authority, as he had no powers to relax rules for
which federal government's approval was needed, it said. Mr Wattoo
also violated the purchase manual by relaxing all requirements for
the purchase of the aircraft, the reference alleged.

The prosecution said he created a fabricated emergency for the
purchase of the aircraft despite the fact that a Cessna 441
aircraft was available with the provincial government on March 31,
1994 and could be utilized for three more years before it required
an overhaul, costing Rs 20 million only.

The price of the aircraft, according to the reference, was
initially agreed at Rs165 millions but the Punjab government paid
Rs226 million at the time when it was facing severe financial
crisis. Since there was no budgetary approval for the purchase of a
new plane, the entire funds were withdrawn from the supplementary
grants, the reference alleged.

The chief minister set up a fresh purchase committee, comprising
Nazir Ahmad Chaudhry, the then additional chief secretary;
Aminullah Chaudhry, the then finance secretary; and additional
secretary transport.

The committee, according to the reference, already had met on March
31, 1994 for recommending the purchase of the aircraft before a
summary was presented by the chief pilot, Lt-Col (Rtd) Mohammad
Saleem.

The chief pilot had submitted his summary on April 1, 1994 by which
the purchase committee ostensibly was to be guided. Mr Watto asked
the chief pilot to submit the summary on April 1, 1994, on Friday
then a weekly holiday.

The reference alleged that the accused further misused his
authority by increasing wasteful expenditure in obtaining luxurious
accessories, including customs carpeting for the aircraft, gold
fittings, world maps on club tables and special leather coverings.
These items were included in the contract without presenting a

<a name="29ki">29 killed in Srinagar car bomb blast</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
SRINAGAR, Oct 1: At least 29 people were killed and more than 40
others injured after suicide bombers blew up a car outside occupied
Kashmir's legislature. The blast damaged at least 150 buildings and
street stalls around the tightly guarded legislature, including a
six-storey hotel.

Gunfire was heard for four hours after the attack inside the
building, after two other men stormed inside and began shooting.

Police said a total of 29 people died either from injuries suffered
in the bombing or from the firefight. Three of the dead were
suicide bombers, 19 were civilians and employees of the
legislature, while seven were Indian troops and policemen.

Jaish-i-Mohammad, a Mujahideen's outfit fighting Indian occupation
in Kashmir, has claimed the responsibility for the blast.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Sept 30: Mian Arshad, an aide to detained PPP secretary-
general Jehangir Badar, was allegedly tortured to death in the
custody of National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the victim's son
and PPP leaders claimed. However, the Punjab NAB officials
immediately refuted the allegation, claiming that the deceased died
of a cardiac arrest during interrogation.

Mian Raees, Mian Arshad's son and a Naib Nazim told Dawn that the
NAB authorities had been pressuring his father to turn approver
against Mr Badar who, too, has been in the NAB custody for the last
some months facing charges of corruption and misuse of authority as
a federal minister.

Mr Raees alleged his father had sustained four injuries; one on his
left eyebrow, a head injury, one around his neck and he was
profusely bleeding from nose.

The body was taken to the city mortuary for autopsy. A number of
party leaders and workers and relatives, fuming with anger, many of
them also carrying arms reached the place shortly thereafter. A
large number of police contingent was deployed there to ward off
any untoward situation.

Angry PPP activists and relatives surrounded the Racecourse police
station later in the night and tried to set the building on fire.
They were demanding registration of a murder case against the NAB
officials.

<a name="cana">Canada lifts sanctions</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
OTTAWA, Oct 1: Canada said it was lifting almost all its economic
and political sanctions on Pakistan as a reward for Islamabad's
decision to support a United States-led campaign against global
terrorism.

Foreign Minister John Manley and International Aid Minister Maria
Minna said in a statement that Ottawa would also forgive up to
C$447 million ($283 million) in outstanding loans on the
understanding that Pakistan used the money on development projects.

Only the ban on military exports will remain and existing
restrictions on military sales to India will stay in place.

Minna said Pakistan had 43 outstanding loans totalling C$447
million. -Reuters

<a name="600m">$600m US economic support under study</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Oct 2: The United States was said to be readying a
$600-million economic support program for Pakistan on which action
would be taken as soon as Congress agrees to lift democracy
sanctions against Pakistan.

Last week, making a waiver in the democracy or Section 508
sanctions, the administration had announced an outright cash grant
of $50 million for Pakistan. Presidential waiver can be exercised
for a maximum of $50 million each year under Section 508. A new
financial year began on Oct 1, and a further infusion of money
under Section 508 can also now be made. A bill to waive Section 508
sanctions altogether is under consideration by the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.

The outlines of what the reported new, larger aid package really
means and what its exact component will be are hazy. Pakistan's
immediate requirement is for assistance that can be quickly
disbursed, and it will certainly be far happier with grants than
with aid that goes out in the form of loans, thus adding to its
debt burden.

Talks have been going on directly between Washington and Islamabad
and a possible US role in Pakistan's economic recovery program will
be discussed again when Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz visits
Washington next week.

Since Pakistan's pledge of support to the US-led campaign against
terror, the US has rescheduled $379 million in debt payments out of
the total of $2.7 billion owed by Pakistan to America. The
International Monetary Fund has meanwhile approved a $135-million
loan to Pakistan as the third and final part of a $569-million
standby balance-of-payments support agreement.

<a name="warr">War risk surcharge: Pakistan likely to suffer $200m loss</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Special Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Oct 4: Pakistan is likely to suffer a loss of nearly 200
million dollars over the next 12 months as a result of the
decisions taken in the last week of September by the London-based
Joint War Committee of Underwriters (JWCU) regarding war risk
surcharge for ships.

Knowledgeable sources here did not rule out the possibility of
Pakistan taking up the matter with the British prime minister when
he arrives here. He is likely to be asked to use his good offices
on behalf of the 'front-line state' and make the JWCU see the
serious damage its decision was going to cause to the Pakistani
economy.

A big portion of the expected loss, estimated roughly at about $150
million, it is feared, will be caused by the sky-rocketing war risk
insurance rates, fixed by the JWCU, for ships coming to Pakistani
ports.

The JWCU in its late September decision has enhanced the war risk
insurance rates for ships going to six countries - Pakistan, Sri
Lanka, UAE, Syria, Yemen and Egypt. Interestingly, India is not on
the list, although the distance between Karachi and Mumbai ports is
very short.

The highest rates have been imposed on Pakistan and Sri Lanka while
the affect on Egypt is expected to be minimal as the rates for the
country have been kept very low. UAE is said to have provided
sovereign guarantee to all the shipping companies sailing into its
ports so the increased war risk rates do not affect it at all. The
rates for Syria and Yemen are said to be less than those imposed on
Pakistan but higher than Egypt's.

A complex formula is said to have been evolved by the JWCU for
calculating the exact incidence of the rates involving the size of
the cargo, the financial strength of the consignee and the size of
the ship.

A rough calculation, done at the official level in Pakistan,
indicates that each container coming to Pakistan would carry an
additional insurance premium of about $200 on an average, which
would mean Pakistan would end up paying as much as $150 million by
the end of the year, as during 12 months on an average 650,000
containers are shipped to Pakistan.

There are two more Pakistan specific damaging elements to the
decision of the JWCU. First, in order to make it doubly sure that
their costly vessels do not meet any unforeseen accidents, the big
time shipping companies are reportedly looking at the possibility
of not sending their ships to Pakistani ports at all, which would
affect the country's foreign trade immensely.

Second, the profitable feeder services which Pakistan had set up
between its ports and the UAE ports is being seriously threatened
as Mumbai is already said to have started its feeder services to
UAE.

Officials in the communication ministry said that, compared to
these estimated losses, the help Pakistan has so far been promised
and provided by the multilateral and bilateral donors for joining
the international coalition against terrorism was negligible.

They recalled that even when Pakistani ports, airports and other
such installations were under imminent danger of being bombed by
the Soviets during the 10-year Afghan war, Pakistan was never
declared a war zone area by the JWCU and it was business as usual
at our ports.

Why then, they wondered, had the JWCU listed Pakistan as a high war
risk country now when the entire world had joined hands to seek out
and destroy international terrorists who had no nationality and no
face and whose ability to strike any where at any time made the
entire world a high war risk area.

In fact, the officials said, if there was any country which was the
most protected against terrorist attacks today, it was Pakistan
because not only the country itself had boosted its security
capabilities since Sept 11, but the most powerful armada of ships
and aircraft, belonging to the most resourceful countries, had
gathered around in the close vicinity of its waters and land.

<a name="wher">Where the rupee is going?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi and the team of Business Reporters follow the
trail of the vanishing rupee

Stocks have slumped commodity markets are unattractive banks are
not reporting significant increase in money deposits gold has lost
lustre and for once people do not crave for the dollar....so

KARACHI, Oct 5: Bankers, businessmen, stock brokers, financial
analysts are still locked in an endless discourse to know 'why' and
'who' of the unusual phenomenon of dollars flowing in Pakistan from
abroad witnessed during post September 11 period. And then there is
the final question "where has the money gone?" It remains
unanswered.

For more than last three decades, when there were democratic, quasi
democratic governments and military dictatorships in Pakistan, the
flight of capital has remained a permanent feature. For some
unexplained reasons money started flowing in Pakistan last month.

Stocks are down, gold glittered for a while but is pale again, a
total slump prevails over real estate business and then dollar
started downward slide. Commodity trade in market does not show any
unusual trend. The question is then: "Where is the money going?"

"September 11 is now a landmark in study of finance, banking,
insurance and economics," a senior executive of an insurance
company remarked when asked to interpret the phenomenal fall of
dollar value against Pakistan rupee late last week and early this
week.

Dollar fell by Rs4.55 in the inter-bank and Rs1.55 in the kerb in
first two days of this week almost bridging the dollar value in
inter-bank and kerb.

Moral judgement and political fall-out of September 11 event apart,
the insurance operator is fully convinced that the collapse of twin
towers of World Trade Centre at New York and an attack on Pentagon
in Washington has shattered the myth of US political and financial
super power status.

"Dollar will never be again what it was on September 10, 2001," is
the final verdict of the insurance company executive who pointed
out the international downslide of dollar after September 11 and a
"coalition effort of USA and Western Europe" in the subsequent
period to keep greenback afloat will never give it the status that
it enjoyed hitherto.

<a name="thee">The terrorists within</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE recent pronouncements of Sherrif George W Bush, formerly of
Texas, have benefited the Karachiites. A largely attended MQM rally
held in this city on September 26 was addressed by Altaf Hussain,
now safely ensconced in peaceful London. He abhors terrorism in all
its manifestations, or so he announced over the loud speakers to
his ardent followers, and agreed that it must be eliminated
wherever it may raise its ugly head.

The British with, of course, our good at heart, have given him
British nationality and he is now the proud holder of a British
passport and a loyal subject of the Queen. Over the ocean, Langley
has a file on him. He and his partymen are suspected of having been
the organizers and perpetrators of the murder of the four Union
Texas Americans in Karachi in November 1997.

Altaf might care to start reading up on the Don Pacifico affair
(1850), but he should be warned that President General Pervez
Musharraf is hardly likely to send a naval squadron to blockade
Britain, nor is Tony Blair a latter-day Palmerston who will speak
up in the House on his behalf.

To quote from the Encyclopaedia Britannica: "During his speech
before the vote, he made his famous comparison between the British
and Roman empires, saying that, just as a Roman could claim his
rights anywhere in the world with the words 'civis romanus sum' so
also a British subject, in whatever land he may be, shall feel
confident that the watchful eye and the strong arm of England will
protect him against injustice and wrong'."

Now to more serious matters. This country now suffers from the
disapproval of the powerful democrats of the world, all ignorant of
the type of democracy adopted by the democrats of Pakistan, of not
having a democratic government in place and we are isolated, alone
and friendless.

But, with the peculiar circumstances that now prevail in the world,
and with Pakistan being very much in demand at the moment, we the
citizens of Pakistan might take advantage of and benefit from this
military rule.

The Pakistan Armed Forces (Acting in Aid of the Civil Power)
Ordinance, 1998 (Ordinance XII of 1998), specified in Section 3:
"That the Chiefs of Staff of the Armed Forces may convene as many
courts as may be necessary to hear cases triable under this
ordinance."The cases covered by the ordinance were mainly of a
terrorist nature. Under the new law the investigation of all
offences were to be supervised by the armed forces. The great
advantage of this was that it abolished the widespread complaints
emanating from both the public and the judiciary that the police
investigations were defective by reason of inefficiency and
corruption. Credibility was thus lent to the investigation process
by the induction of the armed forces in a supervisory role.

Appeals lay with appellate courts, also set up by the armed forces,
which were ideally suited to try offences in cases of terrorism.
Unlike civilian judges, the military judges were not identifiable
in advance by terrorists or their patrons and hence were not
susceptible either to inducements or to threats. These courts had
no arrears of work and were able to dispose of cases promptly.

And, unlike the civil anti-terrorist courts they consisted of not
one judge but a panel of judges who, although not well-versed in
the technicalities of criminal law, were strongly imbued with a
desire to do substantial justice. Their approach was that the
innocent should be acquitted and the guilty punished without their
being bogged down in a quagmire of legal technicalities. In one
sense, the Anglo-Saxon system in which lay jurors, innocent of any
knowledge of law, decide questions of guilt and innocence, was
partially introduced.

The result was a series of convictions, and in many cases the
innocent were acquitted either at the trial stage or at the
appellate stage by the military courts. Two convicts were sentenced
to death and hanged and for many months thereafter peace descended
on Karachi.

Then the Supreme Court stepped in. In the case of Liaquat Hussain
vs. the Federation of Pakistan a nine-member bench of the Supreme
Court struck down the law as being unconstitutional. The opinion of
the Supreme Court was that military courts amounted to a parallel
judicial system and hence this invasion of the S.C.'s authority
could not be tolerated.

However, the SC laid down a set of guidelines which, in its own
words, "were intended to deal with the fact" and to ensure that the
cases relating to terrorism should be decided within days.

Paragraph 2 of the order reads: "However, we are not oblivious to
the fact that terrorism in Karachi and in other parts of Pakistan
has not only taken toll of thousands of innocent lives but has also
affected the economy of the entire country and it is a matter of
paramount importance that this menace is eliminated effectively in
the shortest possible time, for which a solution be found within
the framework of the Constitution."

Guidelines 3 and 4 provided that the civil anti-terrorist courts
should decide cases within seven days and the H.C. in appeal should
decide the matter within a further seven days. Although not
specifically mentioned it was clearly implied that the S.C. would
also show celerity in disposing of appeals. The judgment was
announced on February 17 1999.

Sadly, these time periods have been honoured more in the breach
than in observance. Rather than days, appeals have lingered on for
months and in many cases for years. One month ago, after the chief
executive publicly announced that these delays were seriously
deleterious to the administration of justice and the maintenance of
peace, the Chief Justice of Pakistan constituted a number of
benches so as to try to expedite the appellate procedure. So far,
the judiciary has not shown much success. Things have not moved.
The old delays continue.

American President Harry Truman famously said: "If you can't stand
the heat get out of the kitchen; if you can't do the job, let
others who can do so." The military courts are the ones that can do
the job and that did do the job before they were rudely disbanded
out of pique.

The residents of Karachi lead a beleaguered existence, assailed by
fear of violence, terrified that acts of killing invariably go
unpunished. Some 70 doctors and other professionals have been
assassinated with brutal and cold-blooded efficiency. Murderers
convicted so far : nil. The crime of those murdered? They were
Shias. Similarly, Sunnis have been assassinated. All are agreed on
two critical points : firstly, both Shias and Sunnis are Muslims;
secondly, the assassins in all cases are invariably Muslims.
Numerous killings have been carried out in mosques

Why do the police not act? They are busy pursuing the different
avenues which lead to personal enrichment or public harassment.
Public pronouncements that the guilty must be arrested within the
week are ridiculed. Firm and decisive action is needed. An
excellent beginning would be for the government to announce that
the SHOs will be held responsible in case arrest and prosecution
are not made within a predetermined period.

In the event of failure to meet the deadline, those concerned
should at the very least be transferred forthwith (to Chachro), or
preferably suspended. There should be a public announcement every
month listing the heinous crimes committed and the remedial action,
if any, taken.

The statement should be precise and detailed and should not be
treated merely as the offering of a vague reassurance.

Why is it that repeated assurances given to the public that the
assassins of Shaukat Mirza were about to be apprehended have been
found to be completely baseless?

Why is it that a notable philanthropist was assassinated last week
to the accompaniment of a yawning indifference by the local
administration? Musharraf owes it to us, the people of Karachi, to
restore the military courts and give us justice. Though an
emergency may not have been declared, does it not exist?

End note: I stand corrected. In last Sunday's column I wrote that
Qazi Hussain Ahmad had two sons studying in the US. Asif Luqman
Qazi, the eldest son, e-mailed me. Both brothers are now in
Pakistan. Asif did study in US for three years, where he learnt
economics and computer science.

He is now an internet service provider and manages a college for
computer science education and training in Lahore. Asif's sister is
married to a doctor who lives and practises in the US. Learned Qazi
Hussain Ahmad is the grandfather of an American-born grandson, a
proud citizen of the mighty US.

<a name="join">Joining the international mainstream</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

The flaming warriors of the hard right apart, a nation sick and
tired of the jihad politics of the last 20 years has welcomed with
a sense of subdued relief the correct stance on Afghanistan adopted
by Pakistan's present set of generals. It can scarcely be forgotten
that the earlier line on Afghanistan, a line whose consequences we
are now ruing, was the brainchild of an earlier set of generals.

Never mind that it had to take an international crisis for Pakistan
to change course and see the light about the Taliban. There is no
point in quarrelling about the means if the end be correct. The
Taliban were a millstone round our neck, a drag on our resources, a
spreading blot on our name. By itself the military would never have
changed course, so strongly was it wedded to the 'strategic-depth'
notion of Afghan policy. The skies cannot be praised enough if
something, anything, has caused, or rather forced, a change in this
absurd thinking. A tragedy for the US, an opportunity for Pakistan.
No doubt a callous conclusion but in our case not so remote from
the truth.

What remains is for Pakistan to cure itself of the ambition of
playing the role of king-maker in Afghanistan. It is in our
interest for peace and stability to return to that country so that
the millions of refugees now in Pakistan can return to their
homeland. But whether warlord, mullah or king rules Afghanistan is
none of our business. Importing Afghan problems into our midst, and
thereby encouraging the winds of fanaticism and bigotry to blow
across the land, is the real threat to Pakistan, not any government
in Afghanistan, whatever its colour.

Times have changed even if officialdom in Pakistan has been slow to
grasp this fact. A hostile Afghanistan mattered to us when
Afghanistan was in the Soviet sphere of influence and many of its
external policies were influenced from Moscow. Pakistan in an Indo-
Afghan nutcracker with a malevolent Soviet Union in the background
was very much a cold war nightmare whose relevance, if at all it
had any, was eroded long ago by the collapse of the Soviet Empire.
Obviously, these past 20 years we have lived in a different world,
chained to a set of shibboleths that only now we are beginning to
break.

Even so, the change now being wrought is wrenching in many ways.
For one thing, it has not come about as a result of our own
thinking but forced on us from outside. For another, the champions
of the old strategy are still in place and it will be some time
before they fully adjust themselves to the fresh winds of change.
The Taliban are not just an entity. They also stand for a way of
thinking which in powerful quarters in Pakistan still holds sway. A
major removing-the-cobwebs job remains to be accomplished.

It goes to General Musharraf's credit, however, that he can accept
new facts and ideas, and fashion his behaviour in their light. A
less mentally supple leader could have fallen a martyr to his own
rigidity. All the same, to begin with, when he became army chief,
his ideology had GHQ stamped all over it: with all the accompanying
notions of jihad, Afghan depth and the strategic space provided by
our nuclear capability. That these notions have taken a battering
during the two years that he has been at the helm is obvious. Under
the pressure of events, the old certainty about these central
governing concepts has all but disappeared. But General Musharraf
has taken these developments in his stride.

At one swoop, a shattering blow has been dealt our Afghan policy.
In the rubble of the attacks on New York also lie buried some of
the superior notions we had about our nuclear capability. Can it
have escaped anyone's notice that what was billed as our greatest
strength (our nuclear 'assets') turned within 24 hours of the
attack on New York's Twin Towers into the greatest source of our
vulnerability, with Pakistan's high priests in panic at the thought
of what would happen to our nuclear assets if the US took it into
its head to flatten them? Is it not a little curious that all the
professors of national security who used to wax so eloquent about
our nuclear capability are strangely silent during these troubling
times?

Putting the famed Dr Khan out to pasture was a good first. It
should be followed by the next logical step of not investing more
good money into a venture that has only raised our walls of
insecurity instead of lowering them. While the world worries about
nuclear weapons falling into the wrong hands, some lingering
importance still attaches to them. Five years down the line they
will be as useless as Russia's rusting nuclear arsenal. If there
are any takers for our 'strategic assets' (hilarious phrase) we
should sell them while we still can. A write-off of Japanese debt
(and the promise of some more money besides) in return for a solemn
burial of our nuclear programme should not be a bad bargain.

If India wants to hold fast to its nuclear trinkets, let it.
Nuclear weapons are no longer a short-cut to international
prestige. As for strategic considerations, India's nuclear weapons
are as much based on false premises as are Pakistan's.

Anyway, of the holy trinity of Pakistani national security -
Kashmir, Afghanistan, nuclear weapons - all that still remains
intact is the notion of jihad in Kashmir. But does anyone seriously
think this will remain unaffected by current developments? As it
is, the attack on the state assembly in Srinagar has caused more
dismay in Pakistan than even perhaps in India because at a time
when we are engaged in recasting our steps in Afghanistan, it gives
India renewed opportunity to beat Pakistan with the stick of
'cross-border' terrorism. Let us hope that in Kashmir we make the
right choices while the initiative is still with us, instead of
waiting for the time when choices are forced down our throat, as
has happened in the case of our Taliban policy.

At bottom, however, the issue is more internal than external.
Joining the international mainstream does not simply mean cutting
links with the Taliban and keeping in step with the Americans.
There was a time when there was no Taliban, no ISI forward policy
in Afghanistan and we were good friends with the Americans. And yet
we made a mess of our national affairs, pursuing wrong goals,
worshipping false gods, and in thrall to stupid ideas.

The mullah-military nexus came into existence only in the eighties.
Before that there was a nexus between the military and the US. What
good did that do us? What if after the breaking of the mullah-
military nexus - one of the good things to flow from the present
developments - we continue to mismanage our internal affairs secure
in the knowledge that we now have American support and
understanding to fall back upon?

The main issue is putting our house in order and, for that purpose,
of returning to institutional rule. Let us bear in mind the
circumstance that while there is much about General Musharraf that
is personally likable - a genial and easy-going dictator being
better than a Franco or Pinochet specimen - he has presided over a
dispensation which in almost everything it has attempted at home
has struck confusion and failure.

A few items in a long list: a bad economic situation made worse by
ill-judged taxation measures, plunging law and order standards, the
question of administrative reform and easier provision of justice
not addressed at all. Furthermore, the local government initiative
carried out in the name of devolution is already a disaster
showpiece, sowing confusion at every step and in every district. In
foreign policy General Musharraf has shown the right instincts. At
home his government's performance has been singularly lack-lustre.

If Pakistan is to profit from the present upturn in its fortunes,
two things have to be done. Firstly, the army must define its place
in national life and stick to it. It must not spread itself all
over the place. Secondly, sooner rather than later, there must be a
return to representative rule - minus, I hasten to add, the two
cartoons who symbolized democracy during the nineties, Benazir and
Nawaz Sharif. The present ad-hocism will only lead to more failures
like the devolution plan.

Above all, to get out of the present rut the country needs a
broader canvas of governance than the corps commanders conference.
Render unto the corps commanders what is theirs, the running of the
army. Render unto other pontiffs the day-to-day running of the
country.

If, however, all that we get from the present crisis is a
strengthened military government, its confidence bolstered by
American support and acceptance, the nation will be left wondering
what it gained by rejoining the international mainstream. Just as
we now wonder what we gained from our Afghan involvement in the
eighties.

<a name="anat">A nation divided</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

A CRISIS unites most countries, cementing cracks and pulling people
together behind the government. In Pakistan, however, the opposite
has happened, with the current predicament exposing and widening
many of the seismic faultlines that already existed.

Every society has divisions and differences, and they usually
contribute to a creative ferment; however, when they become
unmanageable, they can be devastating as they erode cohesion and
destabilize the government. Years of poor governance, misguided
policies and disastrous leadership have created deeper and more
numerous disparities and divergences than we can handle. Just how
is Pakistani society divided? Let us count the ways...

First and foremost, and crucially relevant to the current crisis,
is the division between those angry, bearded faces the world sees
on TV screens demonstrating against the US and General Musharraf,
and for the Taliban, and the rest of the country that does not want
to be isolated and lumped together with our benighted neighbour.
Estimates of the relative strength of these two groups vary, with
General Musharraf placing their numbers at "not more than 15 per
cent of the population." In fact, religious parties have never won
more than 5 per cent of the national vote, and have never sent over
six members to the National Assembly at any one time.

Nevertheless, their organization, fervour and sheer ferocity make
them a formidable force. Willing to face police batons and bullets,
their aggressive zeal has paralyzed and toppled governments in the
past. One reason, of course, why they take to the streets at the
drop of a hat in large numbers is that very few of them actually
work. Unemployed and generally unemployable, these fanatical shock-
troopers are increasingly armed and very dangerous.

In a crude way, this schism between the holy warriors and the
moderate mainstream reflects the struggle that has been going on
between ultra-orthodoxy and reform in Islam for centuries. Although
this split started nearly a thousand years ago, it acquired greater
momentum with the defeat of Muslim forces at the hands of infidel
Europeans from Vienna to Plassey. Those refusing to permit ijtihad
(interpretation; reasoning) argued that the Muslims had lost favour
with God because of their feeble faith, and if Islam was to regain
its lost glory, it should return to the fundamentals. The
reformers, on the other hand, sought to use the West's tools of
education, science and reason to compete. One look at the pathetic
state of the Islamic world today will indicate whose views have
prevailed. Nevertheless, the tension between the two schools of
thought is reflected in open or underground conflict in most Muslim
nations.

In Pakistan, the fissures are even more numerous and complex as
Shias and Sunnis, and Barelvis and Deobandis fight it out
polemically and with Kalashnikovs. Theological debate and street
warfare have divided the country along sectarian faultlines. Here
again, a relatively few fanatics have held the country hostage. But
successive governments have tolerated (and in Zia's case,
encouraged) these extremists with the result that literally
hundreds of Shias have been gunned down in broad daylight without
any serious action being taken against the killers.

In this poisonous atmosphere of hatred and intolerance, it was
inevitable that the minorities would be marginalized. Despite Mr
Jinnah's promise of equality and protection to non-Muslims, they
have been progressively pushed into a corner. The writing on the
wall appeared when the Ahmadis were declared non-Muslim during
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's rule in the seventies; Zia drove the last
nail into the minorities' coffin through his deeply divisive
separate electorates that prevented non-Muslims from voting for
local candidates of mainstream parties. This law has effectively
disenfranchised the minorities.

The blasphemy law has made it possible to jail and prosecute
people, usually non-Muslim, on the most frivolous grounds. The
recent death sentence awarded to Dr Yunus for informing his
students of the obvious truth that before the advent of Islam,
Muslim practices were not followed, shows how prone this law is to
abuse.

Then we are divided by gender. If you go to any South Asian
country, you are first struck by how many women are visible in the
streets, going about their daily business. In Pakistan, on the
other hand, they have been steadily incarcerated in their homes.
The other day, I asked Fateh, my fisherman friend, why the women in
his village did not play a more active role helping their husbands
and fathers. He replied that he remembered a time when they did go
out on boats, helped haul in the catch, clean the fish and salt
them. But over the years, they have tended to stay home. As a kid,
I too recall seeing my mother cycle off to her civil defence
meetings in the early years of Pakistan. In the fifties, my girl
cousins used to ride bikes to get to Kinnaird College in Lahore.
This would be unthinkable today.

One reason why we are so susceptible to divisive tendencies is the
lack of education, with less than half the population being
literate. But even the educated are divided between the vast
majority that has gone through the mediocre public educational
system, and the privileged minority that attended private schools
and colleges, and is at home in the English language. For the
unfortunate former group, most doors are shut as the top jobs in
the public and private sectors are reserved for the elite that is
fluent in English.

Provincialism and ethnic divisions continue to undermine our unity
even after 54 years of independent existence. The three smaller
provinces resent the dominance of Punjab, and even within
provinces, tensions divide Sindhis and Mohajirs in Sindh, Balochs
and Pashtuns in Balochistan and Punjabis from the Saraiki-speaking
southern belt in Punjab. Then there are over two million Afghans,
many of whom were raised here and are indistinguishable from
Pakistani Pashtuns, specially as they carry Pakistani ID cards and
passports. Many of those currently demonstrating against the
government are Afghan refugees.

It goes without saying that like every other country, Pakistan is
divided by class and wealth. But here, the inequalities are greater
than in most other societies. From the vulgar opulence of houses in
the so-called 'Defence Housing Societies' in major cities to the
hovels a stone's throw away, there is a social and economic gap
that no civilized society should accept or tolerate. While we are
hardened to these cruel disparities, foreigners are invariably
shocked by them.

So when we organize and mark officially inspired 'solidarity days',
we need to remember that ultimately, we are a nation divided by
more elements than those that hold us together.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 30: Mohammad Akram faces a three-year suspension
after he deserted the Pakistan team for the Asian Test Championship
match against Bangladesh played at Multan last month. According to
sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) cricket operations, the
suspension was recommended by a four-member disciplinary committee.

Ironically, Akram's case was referred to the disciplinary committee
by the PCB officials despite the fact that Pakistan team manager
Yawar Saeed had claimed that the paceman had left for England after
securing permission from the chairman of the board.

The director of the PCB, Brig Munawar Rana, as always refused to
confirm or deny the report. "I can't confirm the story," he told
reporters.

Monitoring Desk

COLOMBO, Oct 3: Sri Lanka's unscheduled cricket tour to Pakistan
for a three-match one-day international series was in doubt after
the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Sri Lanka High Commission
in Pakistan failed to safeguard the safety of the players in the
event of a crisis, website cricinfo.com reported.

Cricket board sources said that they will be speaking to the
Pakistan cricket authorities again , before arriving at a final
decision.

Sources said that the High Commission had stated that everything
was normal in Pakistan, but they cannot guarantee if anything went
wrong.

<a name="worl">World Cup matches were fixed, claims Sarfraz</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
KARACHI, Sept 29: Former Pakistan fast bowler Sarfraz Nawaz claimed
at a cricket match-fixing inquiry that the result of two games at
the 1999 World Cup were rigged.

Sarfraz appeared before a commission headed by Justice Karamat
Bhandari at the Lahore High Court and recorded a statement for two
hours, registrar Kazim Ali Malik told Reuters. "He gave a lengthy
statement. I can't go into the details, all I can confirm is he
told the commission he believes two World Cup games were fixed," he
said.

The Bhandari commission was constituted by the Pakistan government
last month to inquire into allegations that Pakistan's matches
against Bangladesh and India in the World Cup in England were
fixed.

Pakistan lost both games but still qualified for the next stage of
the tournament and eventually made it to the final, which they lost
to Australia.

The commission will also look into the conduct of Pakistani umpire
Javed Akhtar when he stood in the Test match between England and
South Africa at Headingley in 1998.

"Nawaz had been asked by the commission to make himself available
as he was the first person to raise doubts over the results of the
matches," Malik said.

This is the second government-level inquiry into match fixing being
held in Pakistan. The first, by Justice Malik Qayyum, recommended a
life ban on former captain Salim Malik and fines on Wasim Akram,
Waqar Younis, Saqlain Mushtaq, Saeed Anwar and Inzamam-ul-Haq, all
current Pakistan team members.

Malik added no decision had been taken on whether former South
African cricket chief Ali Bacher or former Pakistan Cricket Board
chief executive Majid Khan - they have supported the World Cup
match-fixing allegations - would be required to record their
statements before the commission.-Reuters
