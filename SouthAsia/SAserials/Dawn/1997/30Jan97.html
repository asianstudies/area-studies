<a name="scup">SC upholds dissolution of NA, govts ouster</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, Jan 29: The Supreme Court on Wednesday by a majority decision 
upheld President Legharis Nov 5 proclamation dissolving the National 
Assembly and dismissing Benazir Bhuttos government.
    
The six-one verdict was announced by Chief Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah at 
4.25 pm in a jam-packed court room.
    
Reading from a 12-page short order, Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah said the 
presidential order contained enough substance and adequate material had 
been provided to conclude that the government could not be run in 
accordance with the provisions of the constitution and that an appeal to 
the electorate had become necessary.
    
Justice Zia Mahmood Mirza was the only judge who said the presidential 
order was illegal and could not be sustained and the National Assembly, the 
prime minister and the cabinet stood restored.
    
Outside the Supreme Court building, angry PPP workers raised slogans 
against the judgement and President Farooq Leghari.
    
The chief justice read out the operative parts of the short order as the 
presidents counsel Khalid Anwar received congratulations from his junior 
colleagues.
    
Benazir Bhuttos counsel Aitzaz Ahsan listened to the judgement shaking his 
head in disagreement.

<a name="bena">Benazirs plea was different from Nawaz case: Nasim</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, Jan 29: The 1993 and 1996 dissolution cases stood on entirely 
different footings, former chief justice Dr Nasim Hasan Shah, the author of 
the only apex court judgement that revived a dissolved central legislature 
and restored a sacked prime minister, said in his comment on the dismissal 
of ousted premier Benazir Bhuttos petition on Wednesday.

He recalled that he had held in his verdict on Mian Nawaz Sharifs petition 
that the president can dissolve the National Assembly if the machinery of 
the government has broken down completely and the federation cannot be run 
in accordance with the provisions of the constitution and an appeal to the 
electorate is necessary.

The attorney-generals emphasis in the 1993 case was on the 
irreconcilable differences between the president and the PM as evidenced 
by (Prime Minister) Nawaz Sharifs speech of April 17, 1993. The conflict, 
according to the AG, created a constitutional deadlock that could only be 
resolved by the dissolution of the NA and removal of the PM.

The Supreme Court held that dissolution order was based on an incorrect 
appreciation of the role assigned to the president and of the powers vested 
in him by the constitution.

The PM is not answerable to the president. In fact, it is the president who 
is obliged to act on the advice of the PM except when he enjoys 
discretionary powers.

The Benazir Bhutto case was distinguishable because extra-judicial killings 
in Karachi had reached the level of state terrorism and corruption a 
magnitude that threatened the very security of the state.

The government acted in violation of Article 190 of the constitution, which 
says all executive and judicial authorities in Pakistan shall act in aid of 
the Supreme Court. Instead of readily and honestly complying with the 
Supreme Court verdict in the Judges Case, the prime minister castigated 
and ridiculed it and implemented it reluctantly in phases.

Then there was the allegation of wiretapping of state functionaries, which 
is also a violation of a fundamental right.

In reply to a question, Dr Nasim Hasan Shah said he had yet to see the 
short order of the Supreme Court but it must have found substance in these 
charges and grounds which, if established, are sufficient to warrant a 
constitutional valid dissolution.

<a name="army">Army official disallowed to visit Pakistan mission</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Jan 26: Pakistans ambassador to the United Nations, Ahmad Kamal, 
asked security guards at the mission here to throw out an army captain. 
Yayha Qureshi, when he entered the mission from the adjoining consulate 
office, to meet Lt Col Nadeem Ijaz Mallik, a defence adviser to the mission 
following an altercation.
    
Mr Kamal also ordered the adjoining doors between the mission and consulate 
to be sealed, claiming that secrets were being compromised, mission and 
consulate sources confirmed.
    
According to Capt. Qureshi he had come to visit his uncle Javed Aslam, 
commercial counsellor at the consulate, and when he wished to meet Lt Col 
Nadeem Ijaz, a friend, he was told to go to the mission next door using the 
adjoining door. However, as Capt. Quereshi entered the consulate through 
the door inquiring about Col Nadeem, he was confronted by Mr Kamal in the 
stairwell who questioned his presence there.
   
According to a written report submitted by Capt. Qureshi, he identified 
himself as an army officer and said he was visiting Lt Col Nadeem and then 
he proceeded to ask Mr Kamal to identify himself.
    
Ignoring the captains query, Mr Kamal ordered the guards to throw the 
captain out and told his staff never to allow him to visit anyone at the 
mission again.

<a name="cons">Consensus reached on NFC award</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Saleem Shahid 

QUETTA, Jan 25: The representatives of all the provinces and the federal 
government reached a consensus on the NFC Award and decided to submit 
recommendations to the president for announcement.
    
The commission conceded the demand of Balochistan and approved a subvention 
in the fresh award for the development of the province.
    
According to a source, the NFC agreed to release funds to Balochistan to 
help it tide over its financial crisis once the award was announced by 
President Farooq Leghari.
    
Balochistan had a budget deficit of Rs2 billion during the current fiscal 
year which forced the provincial government to stop the Annual Development 
Programme, suspend fresh recruitments in government departments and 
observe strict austerity measures by way of merger of various departments.
    
According to an official announcement, the composition of the federal 
divisible pool has been changed and widened including more taxes and 
resources in the pool. The delegates also reached an accord on the sharing 
of divisible pool among the federation and the federating units, which has 
hitherto been a point of discord.

<a name="care">Caretakers ban Junoon Group song on Ehtesab</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Jan 23: The caretaker government has banned the playing of a 
song prepared by Junoon Group named Ehtesab.
    
The song which longs for the accountability of the corrupt rulers (sans 
Military) has been banned by the caretaker government on three grounds: 1) 
It is detrimental to election process, 2) It promotes the cause of Tehrik-
i-Insaaf, and 3) It would damage the national integrity.
    
Suleman, the main vocalist in the song, told the Press that the president 
has cheated the countrymen by dissolving the National Assembly. He said the 
assembly was dissolved on November 5, 1996 on the promise of accountability 
and we thought to make our contribution for this cause as singer to the 
nation and made this song.
    
The video of the song shown to the Press asks for accountability and 
accountability only.
    
The video shows a lilliputian as MNA alighting from a latest model Pajero 
jeep, glued to mobile phone, escorted by a gigantic bodyguard carrying a 
rifle double the size of the MNA. It also shows horses eating salad 
apparently in five Star Hotel.
    
The singer further said for how long we will continue chanting slogans 
Zindabad, Zindabad. The song , he said, has already been purchased. The 
song asks for the accountability of those who ruled the country for half a 
century but shows no glimpse of military governments. The military 
dictators , Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, and Ziaul Haq are shown but not in 
uniform.

<a name="cent">Centre was partner in Karachi killings, SC told</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, Jan 26: President Farooq Legharis counsel Khalid Anwar told the 
Supreme Court that the federal government was a partner of the Sindh 
government in the extra- judicial killings in Karachi.
    
Arguing his case in the apex court, Khalid Anwar tried to establish that 
Benazir Bhutto was personally involved in the Karachi operation and though 
law and order was a provincial subject, the federal government cannot 
absolve itself from the responsibility of extra-judicial killings. He said 
the federal government had not only complete knowledge of the happenings in 
Karachi but was also involved there.
    
He tried to establish that though the president had been presiding at the 
law and order meetings, it was in fact an evidence that he was concerned 
over the situation.
    
Khalid Anwar said the claim that the federal government had nothing to do 
with the law and order situation in Karachi was untenable. Reading the 
ordinance which had conferred wide powers to the Rangers, the presidents 
counsel mentioned that it was clearly written in the ordinance that the 
powers were being conferred by the federal government. It is the federal 
government which conferred the powers to the Rangers for arrest and 
search, he added.
    
He read out another letter in which the interior ministry had said that the 
functions and responsibilities of Rangers in Karachi would be worked out 
mutually between the provincial government, the Rangers and the federal 
government. So they are partners in the crime.
    
Khalid Anwar said the centre had given specific role to the Rangers due to 
law and order situation in Karachi and quoting a letter said the Rangers 
were working independently having their own intelligence network and 
independent operations. However, he said, according to that letter, it was 
decided to keep a police officer with them. So the role of Sindh police 
was that of a cloak.
    
The respondents counsel also read out a letter of the federal government 
dated July 18, 1996 which said that after considering Sindh situation it 
has been decided to extend Rangers stay for another year in that province. 
This establishes that the federal government was assuming greater and 
greater responsibility, he added.
    
When Khalid Anwar quoting a letter said that the Rangers were made an 
attached department of the federal government, he was reminded by Justice 
Irshad Hasan Khan that Rangers had always been an attached department of 
the federal government.
    
Khalid Anwar told the court that the cabinet at its December 24, 1995 
meeting had appreciated the excellent work done by the Rangers and police 
in Karachi.
    
You defamed the country internationally by violating human rights, is this 
excellent work? he asked.
    
In another letter issued by the interior ministry, he said, the Sindh 
government had been asked by the competent authority to re-arrest all those 
people who had been given bails by the provincial high court.
    
He said if at all there was any need to re-arrest any person, it should 
have been on merit and case to case basis instead of issuing order to 
prepare the lists and re-arrest all those people who had been granted 
bails.
    
The chief justice asked him whether it was a cabinet decision to re-arrest 
all those released on bail, the respondents counsel said the decision was 
taken by the interior ministry. The chief justice remarked that even a 
minister could be a competent authority. If he is a competent authority 
then he (the minister) cannot say he is not responsible.
    
Khalid Anwar said this was a cabinet decision and now the petitioner cannot 
say that she was not responsible. At this stage petitioners counsel Aitzaz 
Ahsan pointed out that the documents being referred to by the respondents 
counsel were incomplete and important documents had been withheld. At this 
Khalid Anwar asked him to give in writing the documents required by him and 
he would produce them.
    
Aitzaz said since the respondent had provided incomplete documents it was 
his responsibility to complete them.
    
Chief Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah at this stage interfered and said the 
respondents counsel has to satisfy the court. We will call upon him to 
provide all documents, he said.
    
When Aitzaz said he would require time to go through them and this might 
cause delay at this stage, the chief justice told him that he should not be 
hyper-technical on every issue. Every thing will be sorted out in the 
court, he said.
    
At one stage the chief justice told Khalid Anwar that if his claim that the 
people were killed in the police custody was to be accepted there must be 
some official version on record. He said according to law no one could be 
held in police custody for more than 24 hours and has to be produced before 
a magistrate after that period. Similarly, he said, if any person dies in 
police custody, the police have to explain the causes and reasons for his 
death. Have you produced that evidence? he asked.
    
Referring to the European Parliament report on human rights violations in 
Pakistan, the respondents counsel said the European Parliament had 
expressed its concern over human rights violations. He differed with 
Aitzazs contention that accepting the report would mean throwing away 
national sovereignty.
    
Justice Irshad Hasan Khan asked him whether this report was submitted to 
the government, to which he replied in the positive.
    
Khalid Anwar then referred to an official handout issued by the Sindh 
information department informing that the government and the Mohajir Qaumi 
Movement had agreed to the scrutiny of MQM cases, return of confiscated 
goods of MQM, restoration of political activities by the MQM, restoration 
of telephone lines, and not to arrest the MQM leaders against whom, there 
is no FIR.
    
He said the handout was an indirect confession of the provincial government 
that there were some fictitious cases registered which would be 
scrutinised, goods had been confiscated without any law and telephone 
connections cut off without any reason. Similarly, he said, it was also an 
indirect admission that the MQM workers were being harassed and not allowed 
to return to their homes.
    
Then he referred to a statement of the US state department in which it had 
been claimed that political violence had taken the lives of more than 1,000 
people in Pakistan. He said the report had mentioned the killing of Sindh 
Chief Minister Abdullah Shahs brother in Karachi by terrorists and said 
that only two days later two bullet-riddled bodies of people were recovered 
who were supposedly in police custody. Is it not law of jungle? he asked 
and added that animals kills out of necessity and not out of savage 
revenge.
    
Quoting another statement of the US state department he said it called upon 
both the sides to initiate talks. There is no infringement of the 
sovereignty of Pakistan if foreign governments condemn extra-judicial 
killings, he added.
    
The chief justice asked him whether there was any government which had 
admitted its involvement in extra-judicial killings. He said it was a 
problem in which the law should take its own course. If a person is killed 
in police custody, the police have to explain, he said and asked the 
respondents counsel about the procedure in such a case.
    
Khalid Anwar informed the court that normally an inquiry is held.  That 
means that the police must have initiated the proceedings (of inquiry)? 
the Chief Justice inquired and added was there any explanation on record 
regarding these killings.
    
Khalid Anwar said that in one case an SSP cancelled an inquiry which was 
being conducted by a magistrate. He said the police took no action against 
the accused policeman. In major cases no action had been taken, he told 
the court.
 
In the case of killing of Faheem Commando, the respondents counsel said, 
the magistrate asked a policeman to appear before the inquiry but the 
latter refused and the magistrate finally wrote in his inquiry that no case 
against police was made out.
    
That is why it is imperative that there should be separation of executive 
magistrate and judicial magistrate, he added.
    
Khalid Anwar quoted from foreign newspapers to establish that the situation 
was critical. He said the situation was so bad that the entire business 
community went on a strike throughout the country.
    
Khalid Anwar also referred to a summary prepared by the home department 
before the PPP government came to power in which it said that certain 
people should be declared absconders and a head money should be fixed on 
them or they may be eliminated. He said it was a clear order that any 
government agency could kill them and get the reward.
    
The chief justice asked him whether he could prove that these police 
officers were awarded for killing any person and reminded him that all the 
government record was at his disposal.
    
Aitzaz Ahsan immediately reminded the respondents counsel that the awards 
were always given by the president whom he was representing.
 
Khalid Anwar said the said notification was challenged in the court and the 
court was perturbed by the summary moved by the home department. He said 
the court had observed that there was no law which allowed the elimination 
of any criminal or fixing of head money.
    
Justice Irshad Hasan asked him what was the relevance when the notification 
was issued before the PPP came to power.
    
Khalid Anwar said when PPP came to power, the same notification was 
repeated which had been declared unconstitutional by the Sindh High Court.
    
The chief justice observed that the notification was issued by the 
provincial government and he had to establish a nexus with the federal 
government.
    
Khalid Anwar said he had documentary evidence to establish that the federal 
government was closely involved with the provincial government.
    
Justice Irshad Hasan Khan reminded him that even in the case filed in the 
high court, the federal government was not made a party. So what is the 
nexus?
    
The chief justice also asked him whether the second notification was 
challenged or not to which Khalid Anwar replied that at that time all the 
people had gone underground.
    
Justice Zia Mahmood Mirza pointed out that it was not the notification but 
only a reference had been made to the notification. You have not placed 
that notification on record, he told the respondents counsel. But Justice 
Irshad Hasan Khan observed that the said letter did talk of the reward.
    
Justice Zia Mahmood Mirza said the first notification did not ask for 
elimination of any criminal it was only mentioned in the summary which was 
sent for the notification.
    
The chief justice asked Khalid Anwar whether he was objecting to the second 
notification because the first had been quashed by the high court. He also 
observed there was no mention of elimination or head money in the 
notification.
    
Khalid Anwar said the summary was enough to indicate the intention. He said 
the high court had also quashed the notification after going through the 
summary.
    
So you say that the Sindh High Court had said it was disturbed over the 
use of words head money and elimination etc. but even then the Sindh 
government issued another notification? asked Justice Irshad Hasan Khan to 
which he replied in the positive.
    
Referring to the petitioner counsels claim that the president had been 
presiding at meeting to review law and order situation, he said, it only 
showed the presidents anxiety. He said the president never asked to resort 
to extra-judicial killings. It cant be said that the president was 
approving of the actions.
    
The chief justice told him that according to the other side the president 
had even commended the governments action.
    
Justice Irshad Hasan Khan also observed that in the report of the Amnesty 
International allegations have been levelled against the provincial 
government and not the federal government.
    
Khalid Anwar replied that he just wanted to establish that the killings 
were at such a massive scale that even the foreign governments took note of 
them. He quoted another US state department report in which it had been 
claimed that the number of deaths in police custody or staged encounters 
had increased in 1995 and that many officials were suspended.
    
Justice Irshad Hasan Khan the reports claimed that 500 policemen were 
suspended whereas the respondent had claimed that only four police 
officials were suspended.
    
The chief justice observed that the situation in Karachi started 
deteriorating during former prime minister Nawaz Sharifs tenure and asked 
if the Amnesty International filed any report about that period.
    
Khalid Anwar said what apparently drew the attention of the Amnesty 
International was the state terrorism.
    
The respondents counsel said Rangers dominated police in Karachi.
    
The Chief Justice told Khalid Anwar to bear in mind that the para military 
forces can be called by the federal government in aid of civil power at the 
request of the provincial government.
    
Khalid Anwar said in this case the federal government was a dominant part 
while Sindh government was a junior partner.  She (Benazir Bhutto) knew 
everything and referred to two documents which he thought were in the 
former prime ministers hand-writing.
    
Is this the handwriting of the (former) prime minister? asked the chief 
justice. I think so, replied the respondents counsel.
    
The chief justice asked him to go through the hand-written notes so that 
the court could see whether any complicity was involved or not.

<a name="prep">Preparations afoot to host OIC summit in Islamabad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Jan 26: Brisk preparations are under way to host the first-ever 
extra-ordinary session of Islamic summit, marking the auspicious occasion 
of the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Independence of Pakistan on March 23.
    
A senior official of the Foreign Office stated, that the summit would be 
preparing the Muslims for 21st century. The distinguished guests after 
witnessing the Independence Parade would move to the venue of the summit, 
the sprawling Convention Centre, according to the sources.
    
Islamabad Police would make tight and comprehensive arrangements for the 
security of the guests. It would also take help from the provincial 
governments in this regard.
    
The biggest flaw in the Convention Centre, a facility to host such summits 
in future also, is lack of facilities for TV coverage. Neither were funds 
allocated for this purpose, said the sources. However, Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs took the initiative and after squeezing its own budget allocated 
over Rs.34 Million for provision of the TV coverage facilities at the 
Convention Centre. We have done it for the national cause, said the 
sources.
    
Besides, many other changes have to be made on the suggestions of the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs which was appreciative of the concerned 
authorities co-operation with it in this regard.
    
The Heads of State and Government from 54 OIC member states are expected to 
attend the extra-ordinary session.
    
Under the OIC charter, an extra-ordinary session can be held only when two-
thirds of its members support the idea. But, so far, all the decisions in 
this regard have been taken through consensus among the member states. 
Besides, 20 Observers would also attend the summit. But the decision as to 
who to be invited would be taken by OIC Secretariat. King Hassan of Morocco 
is the current chairman of the OIC.
   
The Convention Centre is supposed to be handed over to the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs by March 1, as the guests would start reaching here by 
Mar.20.
    
Ministry of Foreign Affairs which is supervising all arrangements for the 
OIC summit has sought help from various ministries to make foolproof 
arrangements for a total number of 2000 guests coming to attend the summit.
    
The Convention Centre was modified and would be furnished with all the 
facilities to make it as befitting as possible, said Foreign Office 
sources.
    
At least six committees headed by the concerned Secretaries have been 
constituted each to accomplish the task of security, transportation, 
accommodation, reception, communication and capital improvement.
    
The sources said, various possibilities are being examined to make 
accommodation arrangements for the Heads of State and Government. The 
government would book entire Marriott and Holiday Inn, and Best Western 
Hotel along with another motel, 23 ministerial houses, Balochistan, 
Frontier, Punjab, Sindh and Kashmir Houses besides private houses in the 
Federal Capital to accommodate the Heads of State and government. Pearl 
Continental Rawalpindi would also be booked and most probably the crew 
coming with the guests would be lodged there. 
   
Two Heads of State would be accommodated in each provincial government 
house, like for instance Punjab House. Each Head of State or Government 
would have one conducting officer. Even if the Embassies want to book 
separate rooms in these hotels during the summit they have to do it through 
Foreign Office, said the sources.
    
Seventy to eighty ministers from OIC countries, expected to attend the 
summit, would be accommodated at the Parliament Lodges in Islamabad. 
   
The Speaker of the dissolved National Assembly has already been requested 
in this regard, said the sources.

<a name="econ">Economy stabilised: Burki</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 29: Pakistan has achieved economic stability in three months 
specially due to cut in government expenditures and rise in foreign 
exchange reserves to 800 million dollars.
    
I am still hoping that Pakistans reserves would touch one billion dollars 
mark shortly to fulfil one of the main commitments of the caretakers, said 
prime ministers adviser on finance, planning and economic affairs Shahid 
Javed Burki on Wednesday.
    
Speaking at a news conference, Mr Burki claimed that the caretakers had 
saved Pakistan from a worst kind of economic crisis which, he believed, 
would have further compounded had the Benazir government not been dismissed 
on November 5.
    
He said that with the disbursement of 76 million dollars by the IMF the 
reserves had reached a little over 800 million dollars. When we took over, 
banking system was in a very bad shape, reserves were depleting, government 
expenditure was increasing, but then we brought about economic stability , 
he added.

Asked to comment on the role of the press, Mr Burki, who looked visibly 
angry, said that, by and large, journalists in Pakistan had been terribly 
inaccurate.  The press has been excessively negative and sometimes did not 
care even about the national interests and published highly wrong stories, 
he said , adding that his experience in Pakistan with journalists was not 
good and that was why he had banned their entry in the ministry of finance. 
When reminded that he used to appreciate the press in Pakistan specially 
for fighting corruption, Mr Burki said he had a bitter experience and that 
he had been misquoted many times.
    
He offered no comments when asked about the UAE offer to provide 500 
million dollars to Pakistan. Pressed further, he said some amount had been 
received from the UAE but did not say how much as , according to him ,it 
was a matter between the two governments, which should not be discussed.

<a name="ibms">IBMs contract for NICs restored </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 23: The contract of IBM  for the computerisation of Identity 
cards system has been restored by the federal cabinet.
    
The restoration of the contract has also saved the government from paying 
Rs. 700 million which was payable to IBM under the punitive clause of the 
agreement.
    
The decision of the Cabinet was made on the recommendations of a Cabinet 
Sub-Committee which re-negotiated the deal with the company and asked it to 
include certain other facilities in the original contract.
    
The IBM has accepted to include a number of facilities without charging any 
additional cost to the government of Pakistan. These facilities includes:
    
a) Card quality to be further improved by increasing the thickness of the 
ID card from 250 microns, as specified in the contract to 350 microns.
    
b) IBM to undertake the responsibility to develop the media communications 
plan for deployment/execution by the government for purpose of public 
awareness campaign.
    
c) Card production time to be reduced from seven days to five days.
    
d) Current contract specifies one card layout. If necessary IBM to arrange 
for separate ID card layout for AJK.
    
e)  IBM will print reminders for registered children becoming eligible for 
ID card.
    
f) IBM to render year 2000 millennium change support for the database 
application so that transition of 21st century is achieved smoothly without 
any further investment.
    
g)  IBM to train 25 per cent more people than indicated in the contract 
from the Ministry of Interior at completion of the project.
    
h)  At the time of project completion when the equipment and software will 
be transferred to Government of Pakistan. IBM to transfer the source code 
of all software applications developed for this project so that the 
government in future updates the software for future requirements without 
having to go to IBM. IBM to provide training so that government personnel 
are able to maintain these applications independently and achieve self 
sufficiency and self reliance with technology transfer. The self 
sufficiency will help the government of Pakistan to market the solution to 
any other friendly country and help in software export. IBM may be called 
upon to assist in the marketing effort.
    
i) At the time of transfer if the government upgrades the hardware to 
induct new technology after four years, then IBM to upgrade the application 
hardware to make it compatible with the new hardware.
    
j)  At the end of the project IBM, while handing over equipment used for 
this project to Government of Pakistan, to also assist the government in 
redeployment of this equipment for other government  projects  such as 
motor  vehicle  registration, immigration, arms licences, driving licences, 
etc.
    
k) IBM to defer and not enforce the charge for minimum quantity commitment 
as per contract, of an amount of Rs. 27.36 million payable in January 1997 
for the services already performed under the contract. IBM will defer the 
billing of such charges to July 1997 thereby alleviating the liability for 
the government on this account.
    
l) In addition, IBM to arrange free of cost a consultant to help develop 
the information technology plan for Ministry of Interior around the 
database being developed under this contract to incorporate other law 
enforcement application as part of an overall Pakistan Information 
Technology Strategic plan for the country. This project will be independent 
of any vendor hardware and software platform.
    
The contract will be implemented in a period of four years and will produce 
an estimated 68 million tamper-proof Identity cards. The company has also 
agreed to charge a fee of Rs. 41 per card for the period of four years.

<a name="cdto">CD to end trading of fictitious shares</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Jan 28: The President, Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari 
promulgated on Tuesday the Central Depositories Ordinance, 1997, which is 
expected to bring the capital market in Pakistan at par with its 
counterparts in the advanced countries in terms of credibility and 
transparency.
    
Briefing newsmen about salient features of the Ordinance, the Chairman, 
Corporate Law Authority, Mr Khalil Masood said the Central Depository (CD) 
would be the custodian of shares in the same sense as a bank is custodian 
of money. The Member (Company Law), Mr Abdul Rehman Qureshi was present.
    
Its most significant function would be to facilitate prompt transfer of 
shares, in contrast to the present situation where shares are not 
transferred to buyers for long periods on pretexts that are not always 
legitimate. Computerised transfer would also put an end to uncertainty in 
the market, enabling investors to make adequate decisions in a market 
characterised by predictability and protecting their interests.
    
The scheme will enable de-materialisation of shares in that there will be 
no certificates and all the transfers and relevant records will exist in 
the computer. However, the Ordinance also does not debar a shareholder from 
obtaining a share certificate, if he so desires. By doing away with 
physical handling of shares, the CD will save brokers from the hassle of 
paper work which consumes enormous amounts of their time and effort. 
Consequently, they will be able to devote their resources and talent for 
development of their clientele by offering better advisory and other 
services. With the establishment of automated trading, CD and automatic 
clearing and settlement system, the entire legal and technical 
paraphernalia of a sound capital market had been put in place in Pakistan, 
he remarked.
    
Pakistan has stolen a lead over neighbouring India which still does not 
have any such facility although it has 22 stock exchanges and also a 
national stock exchange established by the Government of India, although 
CDs have operated in east Asian countries for quite some time. It removes a 
major impediment in the way of foreign investors coming to Pakistans 
capital market because one often encountered queries from them about 
whether Pakistan had established a CD, Mr Masud remarked. A lot of effort 
has gone into formulation of provisions of the Ordinance because the 
objective was to learn from the successes and failures of other countries. 
Remedies for problems experienced within Pakistan and abroad have been 
provided for in the Ordinance. The CLA added, however, that as compared to 
India, investors and other market players in Pakistan were more receptive 
to new ideas. As a result of establishment of CD, he visualised people 
flocking to Pakistan from other countries of Asia to study our system.

<a name="paki">Pakistan suffers trade deficit worth $3,037m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Jan 26: Malaysia was on top of the 12 major countries with which 
Pakistan suffered trade deficit during 1995-96, according to Federal Bureau 
of Statistics.
    
Cumulative share of these countries in our import bill amounting to $11.7 
billion is 99.7 percent. Out of overall deficit of $3,037 million, deficit 
suffered in trade with Malaysia amounted to $846 million. Imports from that 
country included palm oil, fatty acid, soybean oil, crude and natural 
rubber latex. Pakistans exports trade with it is so negligible that it is 
not mentioned in the FBSs publication covering only major trade partners.
    
The second and third positions in this list are occupied by Kuwait and 
Japan, with trade surplus of $754 million and $683 million respectively. 
The other countries with which the balance of trade is not in favour of 
Pakistan are Switzerland, China, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, Germany, Italy, 
South Korea, Australia, Iran and Thailand.
    
The major trade partners with which Pakistan was in surplus include: 
 United  States, United  Kingdom,  France,  Dubai, Netherlands, Indonesia, 
Hong Kong, Belgium, Canada, Spain and Bangladesh.
    
Japan emerges as the biggest exporter of goods to Pakistan and third 
biggest importer of goods from this country. As importer, it follows United 
States, Hong Kong and Germany. The shares of these four countries in our 
exports stood at 6.6%, 15.5%, 9.1% and 6.8%, respectively. However, our 
exports with these countries show a declining trend over 1994-95.
    
The countries whose exports to Pakistan were on the increase, as compared 
to 1994-95, included Japan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, China, 
Fuzrah, Australia, Netherlands, and Thailand. The increases in imports from 
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are explained by the rising price of POL, which 
accounted for 37% increase in its imports, in terms of Rupees.
    
The categories the import of which declined in 1995-96, as compared to 
1994-95 included edible oil (6.8%),  transport equipment (1.6%), tea 
(1.5%), and synthetic fibre (6.0%). This is, however, offset by impressive 
increase in other imports, e.g. machinery (17.4%), chemicals (excl. 
fertiliser & medicines) (38%), iron & steel (41.5%), fertiliser 
manufactured (197.6%), medicinal products (35.1%), paper & paper products 
(33.8%), tyres & tubes (35.2%), synthetic & artificial silk yarn (44.8%), 
milk & milk food for infants (96.8%), and miscellaneous (22.4%).
    
Region-wise, the FBS analysis shows that imports from Western Europe 
constituted 26.7% of the total imports; of these, 20.2% were from EEC. 
Imports from Middle East, source of all the fuel oil, accounted for 21.9% 
of which 19.3% was from Asian countries. The share of North America in our 
import bill was 9.8% including 8.9% from United States.
    
The share of Japan, USA, Malaysia, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia in total import 
bill during the year was 39.1% as against their combined share of 38.5% 
during previous year. Pakistans imports from Japan included mainly 
machinery, transport equipment, iron & steel, organic chemicals. From USA, 
unmilled wheat was the top import, followed by machinery, fertiliser, iron 
& steel, transport equipment and organic chemicals. Wheat, in terms of 
value, constituted 37% of total imports from USA.
    
The countries with which the trade deficit shows an increasing trend in 
1995-96 as compared to 1994-95 included: Japan, Saudi Arabia, China, 
Australia, Malaysia, Kuwait, Switzerland and Singapore. 
   
Among these, the imports from Hong Kong, Belgium, Canada and pain were 
evidently so small that they are not mentioned in the FBS publication.

<a name="rest">Restoration of PPP govt rumours unsettle foreign buyers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 28: After early steep rise, the Karachi Stock Exchange index 
on Tuesday faltered in the mid-session on selling triggered by rumours that 
the Supreme Court might restore the Benazir government.
    
The news that the Presidents counsel failed to provide evidence against 
judicial killings in Karachi, one of the main dismissal charges of the 
Bhutto government, seems to have unsettled some of the foreign buyers who 
hastened to take profits, some analysts said.
    
The other unsettling news was Presidents interview to the CNN telling that 
he might resign on morale grounds if the apex court restores the government 
of Benazir Bhutto.
    
The markets nervousness and the negative reaction to both the above 
perceptions is well reflected in the KSE 100-share index, which in the 
early session picked up the thread from the overnight run-up and rose 18 
points to 1,520 but late selling pushed it down to close around the last 
level of 1.503.00, showing a marginal rise of only 0.84 point.
    
Later, in the evening trading, it fell further by 2.16 points and was last 
quoted at 1,500.84 points, indicating that it could again breach the 
barrier of 1,500 points provided the news from Islamabad are not that 
encouraging.
 
Its sitting on edge of the barrier, said a broker adding move both ways 
was depending on background political news.
    
The sharp reaction in the index was largely caused by massive selling in 
pivotals such as Hub-Power and PTC vouchers, which together pulled it by 
more than 18 points owing to their heavy weightage in it.
    
Both the shares, which were shaping well to stabilise beyond Rs 40 on the 
strength of strong foreign fund buying, again came in for massive selling 
and accounted for a half of the total volume.
    
Both of them faced massive liquidation at the higher levels and took the 
entire market along with them.
    
PTC vouchers seemed to have received heavy battering at the last three 
sessions persistent rise and was last quoted Rs 1.10 down as some of the 
foreign investors hastened to take profits at the inflated levels.
    
Analysts said revival of demand in most of the investment shares, notably 
bank and modaraba and leasing companies, should have strengthened the 
underlying sentiment but for heavy selling in the current favourites, which 
took the market along with them in the downward territory.
    
Cement, energy and some of the chemical and pharma shares performed well 
but could stem selling coming from the jobbers and weakholders.
    
Despite nervous selling all was not bad with the broader market as gainers 
maintained a fair lead over the losers, reflecting the presence of strong 
selective support.
    
However, it is generally believed that the market might be able to maintain 
the current status quo until the Supreme Court judgement and could behave 
in an erratic fashion.
    
Most of the MNCs, however, managed to post fresh gains on active support 
under the lead of Shell Pakistan, Glaxo-Welcome, Fauji Fertiliser, Engro 
Chemicals, BOC Pakistan and Cyanamid Pakistan, which posted fresh gains 
ranging from Rs 1.15 to 5.
    
Among the local blue chips, which scored good gains, 15th ICP, ICP SEMF, 
Ghemini Leasing, Crescent Bank, Javed Omer, Soneri Bank, Lakson Tobacco, 
Fazal Textiles, Gatron Industries and M. Ismail Textiles were leading, 
rising by one rupee to Rs 4.15.
    
Taha Spinning, Adamjee Insurance, 17th ICP, KSB Pumps, PTC and Pakistan 
Services were among the leading losers, falling by one rupee to Rs 3. Other 
losses were fractional.
    
Trading volume crossed the 30 million shares mark for the first time during 
the current year and was last placed at 35.059 million shares, bulk of 
which went to the credit of Hub-Power and PTC vouchers.
    
There were 281 actives out of which 173 shares rose, 47 fell with 61 
holding on to the last levels.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, lower 40 paisa on 8.120m 
shares, followed by PTC vouchers, easy Rs 1.10 on 7.074m, ICI Pakistan, 
easy 30 paisa on 3.005m, Dewan Salman, off 40 paisa on 2.895m, and Dhan 
Fibre, up 15 paisa on 2.250m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by D. G. Khan Cement, steady 10 paisa 
on 464m, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, off Rs 1.10 on 0.400m, ICI Pakistan (r), up 
20 paisa on 0.417m, LTV Modaraba, up 20 paisa on 0.297m, Ibrahim Fibre, 
higher 15 paisa on 0.235m, Nishat Mills, firm five paisa on 0.236m, and 
Punjab Modaraba, up 15 paisa on 0.195m shares. There were some other 
notable deals also.

<a name="imfo">IMF okays 2nd tranche of $80m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Jan 24: The IMF board of directors has approved the second 
tranche of $80 million for Pakistan.
    
A senior IMF official told Pakistani correspondents on Thursday night the 
approval was obtained without a formal board meeting, through a process of 
circulating the proposal to all the 24 executive directors, none of whom 
raised an objection which could have led to a formal meeting. The approval 
was given by the 24 EDs.
    
Normally the IMF officials do not speak to the media on these sensitive 
subjects but Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi specially introduced Pakistani 
journalists to this official who then aired his complaint saying it was 
crucial for the IMF to get the second tranche through to Pakistan 
otherwise incalculable damage may have been caused to that country.
    
The official said now Pakistan was cleared until end of March when the 
question of the third tranche would arise and the performance of Pakistan 
would be reviewed by the Board to release the third instalment.
    
The IMF official was asked what was the criteria of evaluation of data 
provided by a government to the IMF because in the case of Pakistan it had 
been widely reported and alleged that the deposed Benazir Bhutto government 
manipulated the figures and played with public sector finances to meet the 
IMF target on a given date.
    
He said the IMF had to believe the data governments provided and it did not 
want to dictate to any government how to meet the specific target set by 
the Fund. That would mean encroachment on the sovereignty of the country 
and we do not want to do any such thing. It is for the government to 
determine where it used its money and kept it in which account. But on the 
given date, IMF had to check whether the target it had set had been 
achieved or not. If it had been achieved, the IMF cannot argue how it was 
achieved.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

YET once more, the 140 millions of this country have been let down.
    
According to various polls taken by private agencies in all four provinces 
it is clear that between 65 to 70 per cent of the population (illiterate 
and literate) do not want the coming elections. What they do want is a 
completion of the accountability process (which has barely taken off) or 
the disqualification of all those who held elected office during the past 
three governments. The people have no doubts but that they were robbed by 
all three. By disqualifying, through an ordinance, those who held office, 
we will simply be denying them a chance to continue their robbery. Surely 
this is not asking too much.
    
The President: He has been a big disappointment. My chauffeur is a literate 
man who reads three Urdu newspapers a day. On Legharis last visit to this 
city, as we were held up for his motorcade to sweep by, he eyed the convoy 
of spanking new Mercedes and asked me why I make him drive a twelve-year 
old Mercedes and why I do not buy myself (and him) the latest model. I 
explained that the Mercedes he drives is bought with my money, and those he 
sees carrying the President, the Governor and the other free-loaders are 
also bought with my (the tax-payers) money, and that he is lucky he is not 
a taxpayer or he would be very angry. He explained that he too is angry 
because what he pays through inflation is to him a tax, and, besides, 
percentage- wise he pays more. His verdict: If the people were to hang all 
the siyasatis who have robbed us, Allah hum ko beshuk maaf karayga. Simple 
logic; street justice.
    
He had read that during the week prior to the start of the Holy Month the 
President had flown twice to Karachi in his special plane to grace two 
private wedding parties. Those two trips, together with the disturbance and 
disruption caused to the lives of the people, cost the country some Rs 5 
million. It is difficult to explain that like Benazir and Nawaz, Leghari 
too lacks inner strength.
    
The Prime Minister: He has many smugglers and other undesirables amongst 
his list of friends. Forgetting that he is no longer a pleader, he 
continues to plead for them and their like. He is responsible for having 
saved a couple of high- rankers, who should, by all that is right and just, 
be languishing in our jails.
    
Each time Meraj Khalid makes innocuous, wordly-wise, or damaging 
statements, his cabinet members claim he has a philosophical mind.
    
Minister of Communications Ghaffar Jatoi: It is a firmly established fact 
that this man has had an amenity plot of 15,000 sq yds, now valued at Rs 
100 crores, converted and allotted to him. The caretakers know, the people 
know. This illegal allotment has neither been cancelled, nor has Jatoi been 
asked to resign, nor has he been sacked. So much for accountability.
    
Minister of Commerce Muhammad Zubair Khan: The brother-in-law has 
identified and announced the scams involved in textile quotas (skimmed  Rs 
100 million), rice exports (skimmed  Rs. 116 million), gold imports by one 
single concessionaire (worth Rs 17 billion  amount skimmed not declared), 
sugar exports (amount skimmed not declared), sale and purchase of land and 
properties by State Life (amount skimmed not declared). He has not named 
the men involved, though the people know their identity, and former Federal 
Secretary, Salman Farooqui, knows full details.
    
According to Zubair, Salman is helping in certain cases and has 
debriefed the caretakers on certain issues. Salman is said to be an 
asset both for the country and any government, present or future. (The 
News, Jan 7).
    
Brother-in-law is obviously a competent man, for long before November 5, 
commerce secretary Salman had facilitated his employment as a consultant to 
various ministries of Benazirs government.
    
Minister of Petroleum and Natural Resources Javed Jabbar: He has failed to 
unearth and expose the dubious doings of the former minister Anwar 
Saifullah or of his sidekick secretary. And, what, if any, action has been 
taken against Jehangir Ansari formerly of PSO who has merely been OSDeed?
    
Shahid Javed Burki: He has done his best; but the odds were stacked. He 
will return to Mother World Bank when his three months are up. Like any 
sensible economist he tried to:
    
 Improve the fiscal situation. Strengthen the tax system by broadening the 
base and lowering rates, by eliminating taxes that worsen distortions or 
depress economic activity, the end result being higher revenues from a few 
broad-based taxes that cause the least amount of distortion.
    
 Not increase excise on transport and power to the point where it begins 
affecting industrial development and market integration.
    
 Achieve an increase in tax/GDP ratio by about one per cent per year to 
reach 17-18 per cent of GDP by year 2000.
    
 Contain or reduce expenditure on wages and salaries, increase outlay on 
recurrent items  operations and maintenance  and raise the development 
budget.
    
 Take steps to change the structure of expenditures, control excessive 
outlay on administrative expenditures, and raise spending on infrastructure 
and services so as to encourage private investment that will lead to faster 
growth.
    
 Undertake administrative service reforms, such as substantial 
retrenchment to reduce numbers, while using some of the savings to increase 
salaries and incentives that will attract able people to government.
    
 As a prelude to retrenchment, prepare a personnel audit so as to 
determine how many people are on the government payroll and the true extent 
of wages and salaries.
    
 Establish a council of economic and social advisers to provide the 
President / PM with disinterested professional advice on strategy and on 
policy (members not to exceed four, drawn from business and academia who 
after 2-3 years would resume their earlier careers).
    
 Set up a programme to divest all strategic and non- strategic government 
enterprises, starting with the largest and most strategic. This would have 
sent a strong signal about the governments intentions and would have also 
attracted the largest number of bids. An interim government could begin 
preparing such enterprises so that they are brought to point of sale.
    
 Conduct an audit of military assets  real estate and commercial  with a 
view to liquidation, and put in place a definite plan for disposing of 
these so as to pay off a part of the national debt.
    
 Begin an investigation of expenditures on education and health to 
determine whether allocated funds are actually spent for earmarked 
purposes.
    
 Strengthen the statistical apparatus. Pakistans economic management is 
seriously hamstrung by the exceedingly poor quality of available statistics 
and their sheer scarcity. Policymakers and businessmen have to grope their 
way forward. Also, strengthen the organisation for collecting statistics 
and ensure that we get results in the next year or two.
    
 Start the process of holding a detailed population census. He knows and 
we know that without accurate population figures every statistic can only 
be based on guess work.
    
In 1991, Nawaz did not hold the census he should have held, because 
prevailing figures were working in his favour. When she came in, Benazir 
did not hold an overdue census because it would have affected her position 
in Sindh and upset Punjab. Now, in 1997, what will Nawaz do? Disturb the 
position at his peril?
    
Nawaz is toying with the idea of bringing in his accountant, Dar, as his 
finance man to better the records of Piracha, Sartaj and Jaffarey. How can 
such men as Burki and Pasha enforce their will and programmes? They are 
helpless.
    
Corruption: Yesterdays business pages in this newspaper told us: Gold 
from Dubai due on Saturday. Haji Abdul Razzak, chief executive and 
managing director of ARY stays in Dubai, a good place from which to trade, 
and is free to buy whatever money can buy. Nothing wrong with that. During 
Benazirs time he was the sole concessionaire for the export of gold to 
Pakistan, something he could not have achieved without paying a lot to 
somebody. He remains the sole concessionaire under the caretakers, which 
again, is not possible without a healthy pay-off all the way down the line.
    
It is said that the good Haji has lent the State Bank some $250 million at 
seven per cent and rolls them to his advantage. Local bankers term it a 
racket. The Haji plays by his rules, our government too, of its own free 
will, plays by his rules. Why blame him?
    
Elections: Same faces, same statements. The sole bright spot was Musarrat 
Shaheen on BBC TV on Wednesday evening. Hamza & Hamza have done well for 
her without putting her through a nose job. Swathed modestly in her white 
dupatta, and with her outsize spectacles, she bore an uncanny resemblance 
to Benazir. BBC also showed her snarling opponent at the polls. My vote, 
were I a constituent of the area, would definitely go to Musarrat.

<a name="apos">A positive move</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

THE provision of reasonably free access to information concerning 
governments policies, projects and acts and omissions is universally 
recognised to be indispensable for the smooth working of a democratic 
system of government. For half of the total period of Pakistans career as 
a sovereign state, this country has had to suffer unelected, authoritarian 
governments which believed that the proper functions of the mass media was 
to project a complimentary image of the rulers and their works. Hence it 
was deemed fit that the media should be prevented from doing anything to 
the contrary. The PR approach to official information emphasised the 
dissemination of good news about the government and ensured that the media 
were not able to dig out and disseminate information that would reflect 
adversely on the government or its doings. The prevention of access to 
accurate information has, therefore, been a major disability for the print 
media in the past decade of relative freedom.
    
It is in this context that the federal cabinets approval last Wednesday of 
the draft of the Freedom of Information Ordinance should be seen. Marked 
hitherto by mistrust and antipathy, the relationship between the government 
and the Press is likely to enter a more harmonious phase in which the 
government and the media would come to see each other as partners in the 
attempt to create an informed opinion. The promised enactment is something 
the Press had long been devoutly wishing for. After all, it is unthinkable 
for a Press to claim to be free without being allowed access to official 
information. The draft of the Ordinance will pave the way for an open 
government, notwithstanding its imperfections. The proposed law should also 
serve as an incentive to accurate reporting and discourage stories based on 
speculation and half-truth. It also negates the assumption shared by 
elected and unelected governments alike that it is for the rulers to decide 
what kind of information and how much should be vouchsafed to the people. 
While a catalogue of the damage done to the nation by such a myopic policy 
would be long and unpleasant, it has to be pointed out that information 
blackout over long periods has done immense harm to our fundamental 
national interests. It has, moreover, seriously undermined the popular 
endeavour to institute genuine democratic governance which is responsive 
and answerable.
    
While the end of dictatorship and the beginning of the democratic era have 
given us a free Press, it is too early to claim that the political 
leadership and the bureaucracy have accepted, without reservation, the 
medias role as the purveyor of information to the people and as the 
watchdog of the communitys interest. The test of such acceptance is likely 
to come soon enough when the government to be elected on February 3 will 
decide whether it is going to put up with the Ordinance or conveniently 
kill it by allowing it to lapse on account of non-enactment by the future 
parliament.
    
The drafters have done well to amend Section 4 of the draft Ordinance which 
had proposed to keep the cabinet, the armed forces, foreign affairs, 
intelligence agencies, financial institutions and the superior courts 
outside the purview of the proposed law. By making these institutions 
subject to the Freedom of Information Ordinance, the cabinet has removed 
what would otherwise have seriously hamstrung the promised freedom to seek 
information. The protection given to documents declared classified and to 
some other categories of information  like the notings on files, minutes 
of meetings, interim orders, and information about individual accounts in 
banks etc.  can at present be seen to be part of understandable caution. 
In any case, the law is not supposed to facilitate poaching into private 
affairs that have no bearing on matters of public interest. Similarly, 
documents classified secret will go to protect vital defence information 
whose revelation will hardly serve any national interests. There will, of 
course, be friction, where a document considered secret by a department or 
agency is denied to a member of the media or the public, which considers it 
otherwise. The Ordinance takes care of this conflict by providing for a 
reference to the Ombudsman.
    
While the Ordinance signifies progress towards a Press better able to 
discharge its duty to impart information, one has to note that the idea of 
establishing a Press Council as a statutory body with the power to use the 
provisions of the penal code against the Press and Pressmen has the 
potential of leading towards a controlled Press. Having taken a good step 
forward by approving the Freedom of Information Ordinance, the caretakers 
should resist any urgings by either politicians or bureaucrats to take two 
steps back by bringing in an unacceptable version of a Press Council or, as 
is being speculated, by making certain amendments to the present law of 
libel which may be calculated to make it into an engine of tyranny.

<a name="prom">Promising the moon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafizur Rahman

A Lahore newspaper carried a photograph the other day of a shopkeeper with 
a banner slung across his shop front saying that all credit had been 
suspended for the election period. Actually the banner said much more than 
what the shopkeeper intended to convey to his customers.
    
What the man did not realise was that elections too are a business 
conducted on credit. Candidates base their election promises on credit, 
affirming that they will do such and such things during the coming year or 
during the next five years. The people who have voted for them  given them 
their ballot paper on promise  then start waiting for the elected person 
to come and redeem the bill of credit by fulfilling his promise.
    
It is hard going for the voter. For one, the candidate who fails to get 
elected is under no obligation to pay back the credit, while the one who is 
successful makes himself scarce otherwise. Even if he is located and 
reminded of his promise, its like trying to get your money back from a 
pauper or a habitual gambler.
    
Therefore by putting up the notice that no credit would be available during 
election time, the shopkeeper was doing something which went against the 
very spirit of elections in our country. For with us the sine qua non of 
this exercise is promises, with the added feature that these promises need 
never be kept. It is to be seen how long after February 3 the shopkeeper 
refrains from giving credit to his customers.
    
Of course it is rather late now, with only four days left to the polling, 
but someone should really have gone over the newspapers and made a list of 
the various promises being made by various candidates from the various 
parties. They could have been put together as a list and published by the 
Press every month or so after the new government takes over.
    
One reads in the Press about investigation and observation teams coming 
from the US, Europe and Britain to study the modes and moods of the 
electoral process in Pakistan. I wonder if their scope could include 
election promises too. Such a task can only be handled purposefully by an 
organisation spread over the entire country, with its research workers 
fanning out and collecting samples so that the report can be 
comprehensive.  From what I have been able to cull from the newspapers, the 
promises have ranged from getting a village street paved to manufacturing 
the atomic bomb. The chances for the fulfilment of either are equally 
remote. The one about the bomb for obvious reasons, and the other (about 
getting the street paved) because the elected member is not likely to go to 
that village again.
    
I dont know whether the determination expressed by the chief of a 
religious party (which has boycotted the elections this time) during the 
last polls to raise the Star & Crescent on the Red Fort in Delhi should be 
counted as a promise or not. Also one does not know if it was a promise 
made to Pakistanis or to Indians.
    
I say this because it was not clear at that time whether it was Pakistanis 
who were yearning to proceed to Delhi as its conquerors or the citizens of 
Delhi itself who had secretly requested the party chief to come and take 
over the Red Fort.
    
I remember somebody voicing the fear that the Indian government might 
protest against the liberty taken by some of our leaders with the Red Fort. 
But why should the Indians have protested? Why shouldnt they have laughed 
instead? After all its just like one of us saying that hell plant the 
Star & Crescent on the Kremlin one day. I mean if it is just a question of 
bragging then let the boast be gargantuan at least.
    
If the study suggested by me was made it would have been interesting to see 
if it was individual candidates who made the most bizarre promises or the 
parties which did so on the basis of their avowed programmes. While the 
parties are expected to know better, it has been proved in some cases that, 
on an average, the collective level of wisdom and IQ of a group is lower 
than that of its individual members.
    
So, whereas the moon has not yet been promised by any party, but a truly 
enterprising one may hold out the vow in the future, that if it comes into 
power it will send up everyone to the moon with the help of the United 
States. (And, of course, unfurl the Star & Crescent there too!)
    
All that one can do now is to see to what extent the winning party (if it 
is allowed to take over, that is) is sincere about honouring its 
commitments and its mandate. But I must say that, on the whole, all the 
parties contesting the elections this time were clever enough not to make 
rash or idealistic promises. Probably they have realised after going 
through three general elections in nine years that the people are no longer 
willing to be taken for fools.
    
Also, there has been more of rhetoric than substance in their manifestos 
apart from the fact that there was hardly any difference between the 
manifestos of the three principal contestants. And when promises are kept 
vague and flexible and it comes to interpreting the objectives set up in 
them, there is always considerable ground for manoeuvrability.
    
Sometimes voters also make promises. I liked the story of the old man in 
Jaranwala or somewhere who had been advised by his doctor not to smoke the 
hookah for it was bad for his asthma. Since he wouldnt desist, his sons 
took away his hubble-bubble. Failing to find it, and not considering life 
worth living without it, the old man announced that any election candidate, 
whatever his party, was welcome to the twelve votes in his family if he 
(the candidate) provided him with a new hookah!
    
Jokes apart, elections are a serious business and one wishes that all 
concerned  the political parties, the candidates and the voters  took 
them seriously. The people of Pakistan have suffered grievously because of 
repeated premature elections and one cant help praying that this may be 
the last of such polls. It is not a nice feeling for national self-esteem 
that we are incapable of making the right choices and are thereby let down 
every three years or so.

<a name="thec">Punishing the corrupt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

AS the much-publicised process of accountability wends its way slowly and 
uncertainly and the popular despair of its inefficacy rises after great 
hopes had been raised for punishing the excessively corrupt, former Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto says four governments had been sacked on charges of 
corruption and yet nothing had been proved against them.
    
Not four governments were sacked on charges of corruption since 1988, but 
three. Mr Mohammad Khan Junejo was sacked for disobedience to Gen. Zia 
who had hand-picked him for appointment as prime minister after the 1985 
partyless elections, and not on charges of corruption. And yet the fact is 
that while she in her term could not punish anyone on charges of corruption 
as she came to power in 1988, Mr Nawaz Sharif could not punish anyone 
either as he became PM in 1990, nor could she punish anyone when she 
returned to office in 1993. And what she could not do in three years the 
caretakers cannot do in three months.
    
But all those regimes did make a number of senior officers OSDs, who were 
rewarded amply by their successors and were the better for it. And few 
persons were punished for involvement in the massive co-operative scam in 
Punjab.
    
What does all that mean? Does it mean that corruption was not excessive 
during those years or the process of detecting corruption, proving it in 
courts and convicting the corrupt is faulty? Should the exercise be given 
up, or a more effective system devised along with strengthening the vital 
process of prevention?
    
Meanwhile, the government is doing its second best  making those 
contesting elections pay all their dues to the government, banks and the 
utility companies. The amounts involved may not be too large in many cases, 
but the government regards that something is better than nothing. As an 
additional measure, those who win their seats will not be allowed to occupy 
them until all the dues had been cleared. Such successful candidates could 
have made many times more money through corruption than, they pay as dues 
to official agencies, but until they are convicted through proper judicial 
process they will continue to represent or misrule us.
    
Pakistan is not the only country which is helpless against political or 
bureaucratic corruption. While India is battling against corruption with 
the former prime minister Narasimha Rao as a major target with several of 
his ministers, in Bangladesh Gen. Ershad, who was ousted from the 
presidency in 1990, has been given bail by the Supreme Court in the last of 
the seven cases of corruption and misrule. And with 30 seats for his Jatiya 
Parishad Party in Parliament which it won while he was in jail he is 
sounding very cocky and pours venom on politicians opposed to him.
    
The process was far more successful in Japan where the political process 
eliminated several prime ministers as proof of corruption surfaced. Mighty 
prime ministers like Tanaka left or were forced out by the party, while 
some of the ministers were punished through the judicial process.
    
In South Korea former presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo were tried 
by a tribunal and the first was sentenced to death and the second to life 
imprisonment. Roh appeared on TV tearfully and confessed building a slush 
fund of 650 million dollars for political purposes and retaining 200 
million dollars for himself. He also shared small amounts of that fund with 
the opposition figures which a few of them admitted. But in Pakistan we do 
not have anyone of the politicians coming forward to confess their corrupt 
deeds as they are hopeful the government may not be able to prove that.
    
In Italy the new government is weary of the prolonged corruption trials 
after the magistrates took the lead in exposing corruption and the dirty 
link between top officials and the mafias and got many of them punished. If 
the process continues the trials may go into the 21st century and that can 
drain energies of the establishment. But the people are opposed to any 
leniency to the corrupt or reduced sentences to those confessing their 
crimes and paying back the money. In Pakistan few are willing to give back 
the loot as they are sure no one will get it from them. And as the corrupt 
are too many in number they feel pretty safe.
    
Clearly the corrupt cannot be punished and the money they looted recovered 
through the normal judicial process in Pakistan. And if special tribunals 
or Kangaroo courts are set up the wrong people may be punished and the real 
culprits would get away. The fact is that when too many persons violate the 
laws and the state machinery, too, is a part of that, it is too difficult, 
if not impossible, to enforce laws against the powerful and the rich. When 
entire departments like the police or FIA are corrupt and collusive the big 
fish will get away.
    
That is the kind of situation that we are facing. When vertical and 
horizontal corruption spreads wide and gets institutionalised and the 
corrupt politicians and bureaucrats are hand in glove, it becomes difficult 
to eradicate it.  We are moving closer to the Colombian situation, except 
that they have cocaine there while we have heroin. President Ernesto Samper 
was found to have accepted money from the drug mafia, particularly the 
notorious Cali Cartel, for winning his 1994 election. The explosive scandal 
led to the resignation of his defence and other ministers and he became the 
prime accused. And he solved the problem by declaring a state of emergency 
on the pretext of a rise in crimes. And Colombian Parliament instead of 
impeaching or ousting him resolved that as its members were receiving the 
same kind of drug money it should let go of the President.
    
We are now told accountability is here to stay and will continue after the 
elections as well and those found guilty during or after the elections will 
be unseated. That is right in principle. But will not the elected 
Parliament act exactly as the Colombian Parliament did and let bygones be 
bygones as the corrupt will be on both sides of the floor in Parliament? In 
the past despite their fierce differences with each other the ruling 
parties and the opposition were quick to act when it came to increasing the 
MNAs allowances, perquisites, and privileges and took only minutes to pass 
such bills, heedless of the cost to the nation.
    
As a concomitant, the Press which exposes the corruption and criminal deeds 
of the officials may come to grief, as has been happening in Colombia. 
Already there have been increasing attacks on Press photographers by the 
police and others who want to deny photographic proof of their crimes. 
Political parties too have not hesitated to attack newspaper office if any 
reports enraged them.
    
However three institutions can now make a contribution to fight corruption: 
The Ehtisab Commission, the Press and the judiciary. To what extent they 
succeed in combating corruption remains to be seen as the problem is 
overwhelming. Even in a modern country like Turkey former Prime Minister 
Ciller, who faced grave charges of corruption, did not hesitate to form a 
coalition government with the Pro-Islamic Welfare Party of Necmettin 
Erbakan which she vehemently opposed earlier and become his foreign 
minister in an effort to scuttle the anti-corruption drive. That shows to 
what extent the corrupt at higher levels can go to save themselves from 
punishment.
    
We have on one side the masses who are victims of widespread unemployment 
and under-employment, of soaring inflation and high indirect taxation which 
makes it far worse, and on the other side the changing political rulers and 
the permanent network of bureaucrats who are exceedingly corrupt and flaunt 
their ill gotten wealth and stay above the law.
    
How long can this stark contrast last and defy all attempts to reform it? 
The people are told of the challenges and opportunities to come in the 21st 
century and the hazards and rewards of the globalisation of the economy 
under way and the communications revolution. But they are a people who are 
overwhelmingly illiterate and the literate relapse into illiteracy often, 
while the highly educated leaders behave more like the uneducated. 
Caretaker Prime Minister Meraj Khalid urges the masses to revolt against 
the rotten system, but if they do the police and Rangers will suppress 
them ruthlessly.
    
The people were told that foreign aid will help them. But after receiving 
56 billion dollars, with 11 billion dollars in the pipeline, the poor are 
poorer for that while the rich are richer. They were told that development 
would help the poor but that too has helped the rich far more and many of 
them have now become major loan defaulters, too. The famous trickle down 
theory of the World Bank and IMF did not work in favour of the poor.
    
Then there was the promise of safety nets for the poor but now we are told 
the state does not have the funds and the need to reduce the budget deficit 
to 4 per cent by June over-rides all other considerations.
    
We are now told the structural adjustment programme of the IMF will 
eventually help the poor, though immediately it will cause greater pain. 
But the people are not ready to believe that as such bitter-sweet 
assurances had been held out from the top often in the past as well and 
they failed.
    
All that makes the current demand and drive for accountability so 
important. If it fails other methods must be devised quick. If not, revolt 
and lawlessness can follow.

SINGAPORE, Jan 23: The triumphant Pakistan cricket team was accorded a warm 
send-off at Melbourne before taking their flight home.
    
With the World Series trophy in their bag and about 150,000 dollars prize 
money and their pride intact they arrive home as the first Pakistan team to 
have won a World Series in Australia after their impressive performance in 
the preliminary matches and their two successive victories over the West 
Indies in the best of three finals.
    
They won the first final by four wickets at Sydney and the second by 62 
runs. After being shot out for 165 in the second final and bowling the West 
Indies out for 103 runs. A long cherished goal was reached which no other 
Pakistan team had the honour of doing so except the one in 1989-90, but 
they too failed in the finals.
    
Our victory in the World Series is the result of team work, said Wasim 
Akram. I consider myself lucky to be managing such a brilliant team.

<a name="mush">Mushtaq has doubts if players will play against India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 24: Pakistan cricket manager Mushtaq Mohammad has reservations 
if leading players will be available for Mays tour of India. He, however, 
hailed the decision to revive cricketing ties between the two countries.
    
Mushtaq, nevertheless, was unsure if star cricketers will be available to 
tour India in May. I think most of the players are committed in England. 
While some will be playing in County Championships, others have signed up 
with clubs.
    
Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Mushtaq Ahmad and Mohammad Akram are signed with 
Lancashire, Glamorgan, Somerset and Northamptonshire respectively while 
Mohammad Zahid, Saqlain Mushtaq, Shahid Nazir and Ijaz Ahmad Senior have 
signed with some clubs in league cricket, Mushtaq said.
    
The English cricket season starts in the third week of April. The players 
who will play in England have informed their respective managements that 
they will be available after the two-Test series against Sri Lanka late in 
April. But this latest development might put them on a tricky wicket, 
Mushtaq said.
    
Mushtaq stated that he himself came to know about the tour to India only 
upon return. In fact, it is you who is telling me that we have to go to 
India. Neither me nor the players know anything about this from official 
sources.
    
However, Mushtaq said it was up to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to 
think what they have to do. I think it is their (PCB) job to decide their 
line of actionleave out those players, send a second string or request the 
English clubs to release the players for two more weeks.

<a name="zees">Zeeshan Pervaiz returns home today</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 30: Zeeshan Pervaiz, who was exonerated of rape charge by the 
Kingston court, returns home on Thursday, family sources confirmed on 
Wednesday.
    
Zeeshan was accused by an American citizen from Jamaican background, Mrs 
Jewell Weekes, a 36-year-old mother of six (three from first husband and as 
many from the second), of raping her in Jamaica on Aug 31 on the second day 
of the three-day tour match when the Pakistan Under-19 team was in the 
Caribbean in AugustSeptember last.
    
We have passed through a trauma and we are glad that everything is now 
over, Zeeshans uncle said on Wednesday. We always knew that Zeeshan had 
been framed up. We come from a religious background where the women remain 
under veil.

He said Zeeshan was under tremendous mental pressure. I sometimes feared 
that he might suffer from a nervous breakdown because one cooked up story 
ruined his careercricketwhich meant and still means a lot to him besides 
the respect and regard he lost.
    
Four of his West Indies touring team members viz Shahid Khan Afridi, 
Mohammad Wasim, Mohammad Zahid and Shahid Nazir made it to the Pakistan 
cricket team and Zeeshan feels if this story had not been concocted he 
might have toured Australia or could have been in South Africa with the 
Under-19 team. After all, Zeeshan had performed outstandingly in the home 
series against West Indies Under-19 a couple of months earlier.

Ali Sibtain Fazli, the lawyer who contested Zeeshan Pervaizs case, said 
the matter would not have gone to the court had Zeeshan not had language 
problem. Zeeshan failed to understand that the woman was demanding money 
for the settlement of the case outside court when she said: `I want some 
do. Zeeshan couldnt understand that `do meant dollars.
    
Fazli stated that though not enough matter could be collected against her 
(Mrs Jewell Weekes), she still was a suspect character. She testified that 
she had six children including, three from the second husband when she 
still had her first marriage working well.

Fazli said not only the statements of Mrs Weekes three childrena stepson 
(16), a son (14) and a daughter (13)contradicted their earlier statements, 
the biggest point that went in Zeeshans favour was his return to Jamaica 
to appear for the trial.
    
They were stunned to see us back. They said: `We were not expecting you 
people back after he (Zeeshan) had been given a bail bond of 250,000 
Jamaican dollars. We developed our argument mainly on this background 
saying that Zeeshan has returned to an alien country, alien people and 
alien court only because he feels that he has been framed.

After the trial, Fazli continued, the jury called Zeeshan in its chamber 
and personally apologised for all the disturbance in the six months he 
underwent.
