<a name="fbia">FBI agent says he cannot name Pakistan officials</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Oct 20: The Kansi case took a dramatic turn on Monday 
when the FBI agent who had arrested him in a Dera Ghazi Khan hotel 
refused to disclose, during cross-examination, the identity of the 
Pakistan law enforcement people who had accompanied him during the 
operation.
    
Agent Garrette was ordered by the Fairfax trial court judge to 
answer the defence attorney's question who was with him, but the 
witness said it was classified information and he could not 
disclose it. The judge at one time hinted he might have to jail a 
federal official.
    
The importance of the disclosure was stressed by the defence which 
wanted to prove that the FBI and Pakistan authorities had jointly 
arrested Kansi and if that could be proved, Kansi could invoke his 
4th Amendment rights under the US constitution.
    
If Kansi was allowed to invoke his 4th amendment rights, all the 
statements he had made to the FBI officials would not be admissible 
in his case as evidence and that could make the prosecution's job a 
lot more difficult before a jury.
    
But agent Garrette twice refused the orders of Judge Howe Brown 
although he conceded that some Pakistan officials had been present 
immediately after Kansi was arrested by him and three other FBI men 
from his hotel room.
    
He said immediately after the arrest Kansi had been handed over to 
the Pakistan authorities and kept in a cell for two days during 
which the FBI men remained constantly with him.
    
He did not disclose where the cell was located but he said the FBI 
men had remained with Kansi to ensure that no one interrogate 
Kansi, as well as to provide food and rest to the accused.
    
The FBI agent told the court that Kansi had signed the statement 
after he was told about his rights. He had waived his rights and 
had indicated he would not hire a lawyer to defend himself.
    
The signed statement, which was counter-signed by another FBI agent 
on board the plane, was placed in the court record by the 
prosecution.
    
Kansi also told the FBI agent that he had a Master's degree in 
English language and he understood and spoke the language very 
well.
    
Agent Garrette said he had spent over one and a half years to hunt 
for Kansi since the killing of two CIA men in front of the CIA 
headquarters in Langley in January 1993.
    
He also stated that Kansi had signed his name on the statement as 
"Kasi" claiming it was his real name.
    
The alleged confessional statement was not admitted by the judge as 
evidence but was taken in the file under seal with the possibility 
that if may be entered as evidence later.
    
The defence was arguing that because Kansi had been arrested by the 
FBI in a joint venture with Pakistan authorities, he could invoke 
his constitutional rights and that would protect him from the 
statements he had made during the flight from Pakistan to the US.
    
State attorney Robert Horan said it was for the defence to prove 
that Kansi was either a US citizen or was entitled to protection 
under the US constitution.
    
Judge Brown said he agreed with the prosecution that Kansi had to 
establish a prima facie case that he was entitled to all the 
rights.
    
The FBI agent was brought on the witness stand by the prosecution 
to prove that Kansi had made the confessional statement in the 
plane voluntarily and not under duress or coercion.
    
Attorney Horan repeatedly asked the FBI witness whether he 
threatened Kansi or offered him leniency for making his statement, 
and the witness replied in the negative.
    
Earlier at the beginning of the hearing, prosecutor Horan conceded 
that the FBI had no jurisdiction in Pakistan to arrest Kansi.
    
He also agreed with the defence stipulation that Kansi had been not 
produced before a judicial magistrate after his arrest until he was 
brought to the US.
    
Horan also conceded that in the arrest of Kansi the Vienna 
conventions had not been complied with and his arrest was not made 
in pursuance of any Pakistan document which allowed him to be 
seized.
    
The court was told the CIA and the FBI had refused to comply with 
subpoenas issued by the defence to give files and documents of the 
Kansi case to the defence lawyers.
    
"The FBI has handed over some newspaper clippings saying this was 
all that they had in the Kansi file," lawyer Romano told the court.
    
The defence also argued that Kansi had been extradited to the US in 
violation of the Pakistan-US extradition treaty, copies of which 
were placed in the court record by the defence.  When the defence 
lawyer, Ms Meleen, cross-examined the FBI agent, he admitted at one 
stage that he handed over Kansi to the Pakistan authorities 
immediately after the arrest but refused to identify the 
authorities.
    
The court broke up for a recess and the cross-examination was 
expected to continue.

<a name="worl">World Bank chief asks govt not to review cases  </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Oct 21: World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn has 
called upon the Pakistan government not to review the cases of 
private power plants set up during the PPP government.
    
Informed sources told Dawn the World Bank chief, who had met the 
president, the prime minister and the minister for finance, 
observed that reviewing the cases of the private power projects 
would discourage foreign investment in Pakistan.
    
Mr Wolfensohn maintained that Pakistan needed substantial foreign 
investment which would only come when the apprehensions of the 
investors were removed, specially of those who had established 
private power plants during Benazir government.
    
Sources said the World Bank president was told that the government 
only wanted to ensure transparency in the privatisation process and 
that the purpose was not to discourage investors.
    
The government, they said, assured the World Bank chief that if, at 
all, any review was made, it would not necessarily mean the 
cancelling of a certain power deal.

<a name="parl">Parliament alone can fix number of judges: PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque     

ISLAMABAD, Oct 23: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said here on 
Thursday that only parliament had the right to determine the 
strength of the judges of the Supreme Court.
    
"We certainly want to resolve this issue through mutual 
understanding but it should be very much clear that it is 
parliament which has the right to determine the strength of the 
judges of the Supreme Court", the prime minister said.
    
Speaking at a news conference at the PAF base, Chaklala, before 
leaving for Edinburgh to attend the Commonwealth summit, he, 
however, said the issue of the strength of the judges would be 
resolved by taking all the important institutions into confidence. 
"We would also be consulting Bar associations  with a view to 
arriving at a consensus ", he said, and added: "When this issue 
will be taken to parliament, we will consult all the important 
institutions of the country".
    
Mr Sharif, nevertheless, denied his government had decided to move 
in the Supreme Judicial Council any reference against Chief Justice 
Sajjad Ali Shah. He regretted that some newspapers were publishing 
stories without any substance. "I do not know how to respond to 
your question because some newspapers have published about this so-
called reference and you are now trying to get it confirmed from 
me", he said.

<a name="usho">US House may sanction refund of F-16 money</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai    

WASHINGTON, Oct 23: An important member of the House foreign 
relations committee on Wednesday indicated the US House may 
sanction refund of F-16 money to Pakistan, to resolve the pending 
issue, but it was not clear whether or when that may be done.
    
Congressman Doug Bereuter, Chairman of the Asia-Pacific sub- 
committee of the foreign relations committee said at a hearing on 
South Asia that a proposal to appropriate money for the F-16s was 
pending with the Congress.
    
His remarks came during testimony by Rick Inderfurth, Assistant 
Secretary of State, before the sub-committee and after Dana 
Rohrabacher, a congressman who sympathises with Pakistani causes, 
raised the F-16 issue and forcefully demanded that either Pakistan 
be delivered the planes or refunded the money.
    
Bereuter's remarks were not clear whether the proposal to 
appropriate the money was a new one or it had been lying with the 
Congress for some time, neither it could be construed by observers 
as any definite move to resolve the issue.
    
The Clinton Administration has been trying to resolve the issue by 
selling the Pakistani aircraft to a third party, but for the last 
over two years no progress has been made. The Administration has 
not attempted to take the issue to the Congress to seek a budgetary 
sanction to return the money as it thinks the proposal may not be 
adopted.

<a name="over">Over 50,000 form human chain in AJK</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

MUZAFFARABAD, Oct 24: In a unique expression of solidarity with the 
people of Indian held Kashmir who have waged a war of attrition 
against Indian rule, more than 50,000 men, women and children 
formed, on Friday, a 56km long human chain from here to Chakothi 
near the Line of Control. The event coincided with the 50th 
anniversary of the foundation day of AJK government.
    
Almost all political and religious parties of Azad Kashmir, had 
united under a common platform, the Jammu & Kashmir Solidarity 
Forum, in the campaign spread over the past six weeks.
    
At 8:30am on Friday, representatives of the JKSF delivered a 
memorandum, signed by all the members of the JKSF, to the UN 
military observers.
   
The memorandum called upon the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to 
grant Kashmiris their unfettered right to self-determination, 
arrange complete withdrawal of Indian troops, facilitate return of 
two million displaced Kashmiris and take suo motu action against 
the Indian government which was contemptuously violating the United 
Nations resolutions 51(1995) 91(A) of 1957 by granting autonomy to 
Ladakh in violation of the UN resolutions and the UN charter.
    
The human chain started from the office of United Nations Military 
Observers post near Domail, the confluence of river Neelum and 
Jehlum, where women had been lined up on both sides of the road.
    
People from all parts of Azad Kashmir had travelled to the capital 
to join the human chain and show the outside world that the hearts 
of the Kashmiris on both sides of the LoC throbbed together. 
Eyewitness reports say although the chain was to be formed between 
12:00 noon to 1:00pm, the people had gathered on the road much 
earlier.
    
"Indian dogs go back." "We want freedom." "Right to self-
determination is our birth right." These were the slogans the 
children and girls were raising.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
    
KARACHI, Oct 24: Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves stood at 
$1.559 billion on October 18 � three days after the 8 per cent 
rupee devaluation.
    
According to the figures released by the State Bank of Pakistan on 
Friday, the reserves totalled $1.559 billion on October 18 � up 
from $1.548 billion on October 11 � showing a growth of only $11 
million within a week. The modest increase in the reserves should 
have been more substantial had the huge 8 per cent devaluation not 
come about on October 15.
    
The SBP statement shows that on October 18 the approved foreign 
exchange as reported by the issue department stood at $1.143 
billion and the same reported by the banking department totalled 
$415.394 million. On October 11 the two figures stood at $ 974.780 
million and $573.125 million respectively.

<a name="govt">Govt gets two offers for 30-year lease</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Oct 24: Two consortia, one backed by South African 
sponsors and the other by Italian business interests, have made 
multi-million dollar offers for a 30-year lease of the about to be 
completed Islamabad-Lahore motorway.
    
The 1.2 billion dollar motorway, which is expected to be 
inaugurated on November 26, carries 450 million dollars of Daewoo 
loan and the rest is budgetary allocations in rupees (Rs 22 
billion).
    
Paktoll, the consortium headed by South African sponsors and backed 
by an Omanese business firm has offered to pick-up the Daewoo 
liabilities, pay 200 million dollars up front and an average 100 
million dollars a year over the next 30 years from the incomes.
    
The annual payment offer of Rs 100 million is based on the traffic 
projections made by the National Highway Authority (NHA) with the 
caveat that it would go up or down in line with the actual incomes 
from traffic.
    
There is no mention in the offer about the incomes from sub-leasing 
of facilities like motels, shopping centres etc on the motorway.
    
The consortium has, however, offered to submit a bid bond of 20 
million dollars. The other consortium, Auotrostrada which is 
represented in Pakistan by a Pindi businessman has offered to pay 
75 million dollars up front, pick up the Daewoo liabilities and 
guarantee 2.1 billion dollars payment to NHA over 30 years from the 
incomes.
    
Anything over and above 2.1 billion dollars would be split 50/50 
between Autostrada and the Government of Pakistan. The income in 
this offer is defined the sum total of incomes from traffic and 
sub-leasing of facilities along the motorway.
    
It is understood that the two offers also pick up the expenditure 
on maintenance including repairs and improvements of the motorway.
    
The government has not yet taken a firm decision on the offers and 
according to some officials, more lucrative offers were expected 
after the completion of the motorway.
    
These officials said the two offers have their own merits with 
payment of nearly 50 per cent of the  total expenditure on the spot 
and the remaining over the next 10 to 15 years and substantial 
profits from then onwards. Any offer which would make good the 
entire expenditure in a matter of two years with 75 per cent of the 
payment up front is likely to meet a favourable response, they 
added.

<a name="trad">World Trade Centre to be  set up at Port Qasim</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Oct 20: The Minister for Finance, Senator Sartaj Aziz 
chaired, here on Monday, the first meeting of the Cabinet Committee 
on Investment (CCOI) which approved the setting up of the World 
Trade Centre at Port Qasim at a cost of over $250 million.
    
The proposed World Trade Centre would have facilities of 
international exhibition, permanent display centre, warehousing 
facilities including refrigerated storage, hotel, merchandizing 
plaza etc. The estimated cost of the project ranges from $250 
million to $300 million.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the meeting also approved $500 
million investment plan that sought to introduce real "One-Window" 
operation. All arrangements, sources said, would be made to offer 
all kinds of facilities to both the local and theforeign investors 
by having the representatives of all the concerned ministries and 
offices under one roof so that they should not face problems in 
getting their problems resolved instantly.
    
The CCOI which has recently been created by the prime minister to 
facilitate new investment in the private sectors also approved the 
provision of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) handling and storage 
facilities by utilizing the exiting jetties of ENGRO and FOTCO at 
Port Qasim. This would ensure adequate availability of LPG at 
economical prices and appropriate safety standards.

<a name="deva">Devaluation: a no-win situation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

THE DEVALUATION was imminent, it was only a matter of time, the 
right political time. Coming as it does only 5 days before the IMF 
board meeting for ratifying the ESAF/EFF agreement, it seems the 
decision could not have been postponed much longer whatever the 
political consequences.
 
The dollar had been appreciating for a long time against most of 
the hard currencies and with it, the rupee was also going up rather 
artificially. And we had begun subsidising the foreign exporters 
sending goods to Pakistan.
 
Meanwhile, the currency crisis of East Asia hit the ceiling forcing 
most of the Asian tigers to devalue their currencies. Many of them 
are our competitors in textiles, our main item of export. Their 
devaluation robbed us of a thick slice of the competitive edge. The 
Indian rupee also followed suit, making it all the more imperative 
for us to devalue.
 
Also, with the domestic rate of inflation at over 12 per cent 
officially (20 per cent unofficially), against 2 per cent in 
countries from where we import most, about 10 per cent downward 
adjustment in the rupee-dollar parity had become all the more 
imminent.
 
This is the third October in a row which has seen massive 
devaluation of the rupee. In October 1995 and 1996 also the country 
had to resort to devaluation. Like the two previous occasions, this 
time also the devaluation has followed the collapse of the budget 
in the very first quarter.
 
The latest reports emanating from the CBR indicate that the 
shortfall in revenue collection was to the tune of as much as Rs 9 
billion.
 
Against the target of Rs 62 billion, an estimated Rs 53 billion was 
collected. An almost 15 per cent decline against a revised target. 
And against the collection of the first quarter of last year the 
decline has been as much as 7 per cent. Even this collection was 
made possible because of tax returns filed in September on the 
incomes earned last year.
 
In order to keep bank borrowing within limits in the face of such a 
marked decline in incomes, the government in the first quarter 
resorted to further cuts in development budget.
 
The finance ministry held up releases for even the core projects 
(except the motorway), except amounts needed for salaries. On the 
non-development front also, expenditures on medical bills, 
newspapers, petrol etc are being withheld.
 
The stagflation that had risen its ugly head in early 1996 
(calender) and which had persisted throughout the crisis ridden 
months of 1996 was attempted to be broken by the newly elected 
government of Nawaz Sharif by announcing measures ostensibly to 
strengthen the supply side of the economy.
 
The cost of production was brought down all around. But so far the 
investors have not shown any inclination to take advantage of the 
new business friendly policies of the government. This has 
manifested in the stagnating exports and declining imports.
 
To be fair to the government, it perhaps knew that things would not 
improve at least for 12 to 18 months. It had planned to fill the 
gap with the incomes from an accelerated privatisation process 
(estimated to be in the region of $7-8 billion in the first year), 
recovery of bad loans amounting to Rs 135 billion and by offering 
amnesty to black money holders.
 
But neither the privatisation process nor the recovery operations 
brought in the needed resources to make good the losses expected 
from the economy in the first year of restructuring. In fact the 
privatisation process did not even take off and the loan recovery 
measures simply collapsed.
 
Therefore, the crunch. The revenue incomes reflect a massive 
stagnation on the production front. On the other hand the stoppage 
of almost all the public sector developmental activity (except the 
motorway and facelift of city of Lahore), has equally affected the 
incomes and employment situation generally. And together, the two 
have caused the persistent stagflation to become even more acute 
than it was last year.
 
Now, let us see what the delayed devaluation is likely to do 
immediately. The foreign debt liability would go up steeply in 
direct proportion to the extent of the devaluation restored to. 
Next, the import bill for food and fuel would go up sharply.
 
The government has announced that it would not let the prices of 
kerosene, HSD, furnace oil, diesel and atta be affected by the 
increase in the import bill of crude oil and wheat.
 
That is understandable because there is enough room in the tax 
component of imported POL to take care of the higher import bill on 
the rupee side. But then to that extent the government's resources 
would get blocked which otherwise were budgeted for something else.
 
The cost of production which the government had done so much to 
decrease by reducing taxes would surely go up again making the 
intending investors all the more reluctant to invest. The vicious 
cycle would continue.
 
The one sector which stands to gain by the devaluation is the All 
Pakistan Textile Manufacturers Association (APTMA). But then the 
world today is in the grip of a recession. Therefore, even if there 
is a bumper cotton crop in the country this year and even if the 
APTMA regains the needed competitive edge in the export of yarn and 
textiles, the decrease in the demand due to the recession is likely 
to keep the export earnings of the APTMA members as low as they are 
today.
 
The devaluation could not have been averted. In fact it should have 
been resorted to earlier. But the adverse impact of the devaluation 
too cannot be averted while there would be no gains on the export 
front.
 
The ripple effect of enhancement of prices of POL products (except 
kerosene, HSD, diesel, and furnace oil) as also the prices of other 
raw materials, intermediaries and finished goods is expected to 
accelerate the rate of inflation further. It is a case of no-win 
situation. You are damned if you do, you are damned if you don't. 
We have nobody but ourselves to blame for having painted ourselves 
in to such a tight corner.
 
How do we get out of this corner? That is the $64,000 question. 
Motorways certainly cannot do the job. Self-sufficiency in food, a 
population growth rate of 1.5 per cent and universal primary 
education can.
 
But do we have the time, the inclination and the resources to 
achieve this before it is too late? That is another one of those 
$64,000 questions which have been agitating the minds of the masses 
of this country for the last 50 years while the ruling elite 
continues to dip into the shrinking till.

<a name="priv">Privatization process beset with snags</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

IN-FIGHTING and the non-cooperative attitude of the major 
ministries including communication, petroleum, water and power, and 
railways has been a major cause for the delay in privatising the 
remaining state-owned enterprises.
 
The Privatisation Commission (PC) which has been assigned the task 
of completing the whole privatisation process by June 1998 has 
reportedly expressed its inability to deliver, saying that it does 
not have the support and cooperation from the major economic 
ministries.
 
It has also informed Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that the 'vested 
interest' of many ruling party legislators was hampering the 
process due to which it was not expected that the entire exercise 
could be completed in time.
 
Insiders maintained that the government's plan to sell every thing 
to obtain $15 billion in the next three years was fast becoming a 
dream as the situation on the ground was different despite major 
efforts being made by the Privatisation Commission and its 
chairman, Khawaja Muhammad Asif.
 
"Even the plan to get one billion dollars in one year by selling a 
few banks, DFIs and industrial units may not be possible to retire 
the most expensive foreign debt," an official commented.
 
He said that unless the officials of the ministries of petroleum 
and natural resources, communication, water and power and railways 
changed their attitude, there could not be any hope to complete the 
process by June next year.
 
The failure is said to have been experienced in the privatisation 
of the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) which, 
according to its officials, could give $10 to 12 billion alone. 
However, they alleged that the high-ups of the ministry of 
communications did not want the privatisation of the organisation 
because of their own vested interests.
 
Chairman PTCL Nasim Mirza is said to have told the high authorities 
that he would resign by June this year if he continued to receive a 
tough time from the officials of the ministry. He has made it amply 
clear that he would not be available to continue serving the 
organisation under these circumstances and that the top level 
people must intervene to rectify the situation.
 
Interestingly, when the privatisation was planned for the PTCL, the 
ministry of communication had approved Rs 50 billion expansion and 
modernisation programme.
 
The Minister for Communi-cations, Azam Hoti is said to be in the 
fore-front to oppose the privatisation of the PTCL and has every 
time resisted the pressure using his party, ANP's bargaining 
position in the government.
 
It is said that Khawaja Muhammad Asif who is a good friend of 
Asfandyar Wali has failed to convince him to go along with the 
privatisation of the PTCL.
 
The PTCL Chairman has reportedly asked the high ups to help 
privatise the organisation as early as possible. He said that by 
the year 2000, the international communication network system has 
to be liberalised under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and 
that if no timely privatisation of the organisation was done, then 
things could be pretty difficult for the government to seek $10 to 
12 billion through its privatisation.
 
The commission faces a formidable job of persuading the officials 
of the major ministries. It continues to face criticism that it has 
only been able to privatise two ghee units and a bank and that how 
could it be able to conduct the privatisation of more than 90 
state-owned industrial units.
 
The officials of the commission maintain that they are facing 
difficulties in privatising the loss-making public sector units and 
that everyone wanted to buy only running and efficient units.
 
For example two months ago the PC decided to privatise the 
remaining six ghee units of the ministry of industry but only two 
could be sold and that too not because of the machinery installed 
there but due to the precious land associated with the units.
 
About the units working under the ministry of water and power, it 
is said that since there is no policy of the government, it is not 
possible to privatise thermal power units.
 
The one which has already been sold, Kot Addu, has been a target of 
frequent criticism by the government. The Minister for Water and 
Power, Major (retd) Raja Nadir Pervaiz has said more than once that 
the government would cancel the Kot Addu deal because a certain 
procedure was not followed. This has panicked foreign investors, 
who are reluctant to come forward for taking part in the 
privatisation process of the country.
 
The British power company which purchased the Kot Addu power plant 
by paying $150 million and accepting $700 million liabilities is 
said to have protested over the issue and warned of serious 
consequences if the plan for cancelling the deal was considered. It 
was also planning to go to the higher courts to contest any 
decision on the issue.
 
The privatisation of Sui Southern and Sui Northern gas companies 
along with other units under the ministry of petroleum and natural 
resources were experiencing similar problems. Although some initial 
efforts have been made by the Privatisation Commission to disinvest 
Sui Southern and Sui Northern, but it could not do the job due to 
the opposition by the ministry.
 
The problems with the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) 
are more serious as it continues to be a loss-making organisation. 
There have been various proposals to privatise it but so far 
nothing could be done.
 
So far the PC has received about Rs 54 billion by privatising 
around 90 state-owned units in about six-year period (during both 
the first Nawaz and two Benazir governments).
 
The new target to complete the entire privatisation process by June 
1998 is apparently difficult to meet keeping in view the slow 
process on which Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif also reportedly 
expressed his concern and asked the authorities to accelerate it.
 
"My effort is to do the job efficiently ensuring transparency and 
to avoid the blunders of the PPP government," said the PC chairman. 
He said he would see to it that the entire process is complete by 
June next year.

<a name="will">Devaluation: will it help us beat India?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Aslam

THE RUPEE, after the 8.7 per cent devaluation, on October 15 is now 
about Rs 8 or 18 per cent cheaper against its Indian counterpart, 
but it is too early to predict whether or not it will enable our 
exporters to recapture markets lost to the Indians a decade ago 
despite a massive competitive edge.
 
The Indian rupee is trading in the range of Rs 36.20 - Rs 36.25 to 
a US dollar for quite sometime against Pakistan's Rs 44.05 and Rs 
44.27 for buying and selling respectively.
 
With a strong production base and diversified export products, the 
indications are that the Indian exporters might not be at a big 
disadvantage against Pakistani products on the world markets as 
their value-additions to the local manufctures provide a much-
needed hedge against any major turmoil in the South Asian 
currencies.
 
Loud whispering in business circles that India might also lower its 
dollar parity rates to meet the Pakistani threat to its exports is 
not relevant to the new finacial reality as the Indians have the 
capacity to defy the dictates of the donor agencies.
 
"It is a text book advice," said the Indian finance minister while 
commenting on the IMF suggestion to devalue the rupee, adding, 
"political governments are not run on text book advice."
 
However, some major Indian export items are likely to be affected 
by the Pakistani devaluation, notabale among them could be leather 
and rice. 
 
In both these sectors, the Indians have outperformed their 
Pakistani counterparts both in price and quality.
 
The Indians, for instance, export leather products including 
footwear and garments worth Rs 60 billion each year with a growth 
rate of about nine per cent but after the devaluation they might 
not be able to compete with Pakistain.
 
Similarly, local rice exporters are now in a position to break the 
decade-old Indian monopoly, notably in the Gulf, after beating the 
Indians on the price front.
 
But Indian textile exports, which account for more than a half of 
the total annual volume of $30 billion, are not likely to be 
affected by the devalaution, as Pakistan is not a competitor as the 
former exports a variety of quality fabrics and value-added cotton 
yarn mostly of fine counts.
 
"Pakistai spinners generally export coarse counts of cotton yarn 
below 30 counts and a limited quantity of fabrics, which could 
hardly match the Indians," spinners said.
 
"Rice exports may not touch the high mark of $3 billion, but the 
private sector could build-up a strong position for the smooth 
outflow of the commodity in the years to come," some leading 
expoters said.
 
But a major breakthrough could be achieved on the cotton export 
front if Pakistan really harvests a large crop of over 10 million 
bales, which will ensure an exportable surplus of more than a 
million bales.
 
Meanwhile, trade and industry circles generally welcomed the 
massive 8.7 per cent devaulation of the rupee by the central bank 
on the perception that it will boost falling exports enabling the 
government to achieve the export target of $9.2 billion.
 
"But much enthusiasm appears to be in the textile sector, which 
accounts for over 60 per cent of the total annual exports and 
rightly too as its main world competitors have already lowered 
their parity levels barring India," financial analysts said.
 
However, an air of pessimism also prevailed as the centralbank's 
abrupt decision could add significantly to the production costs as 
imported raw materials will be more expensive, they added.
 
"It will enhance the foreign debt of $32 billion, and the current 
account deficit of $3.37 billion in that ratio but it is not clear 
whether or not the export sector could match these increases," some 
economists said.
 
Pakistan has a very low production base as compared to India and 
some other countries and the devaluation being a double-edged 
weapon seldom pays back in the same ratio, they added.
 
The spinners were, however, not inclined to say what will be the 
quantum of increase in textile exports but some leading ones among 
them hoped it could be as much as 16 per cent
 
Cotton exporters basing their export sales of lint on the expected 
surplus of 1.5 million bales categorically said they could hit the 
high mark of 2 million bales after the devaluation.
 
"It has given a tremendous boost to our competitiveness on the 
world markets and there is no reason to doubt that we could hit the 
target and at a right price," said a leading exporter.

<a name="ecim">EC imposes dumping duties on bedlinen</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, Oct 18: An overwhelming majority of European Union (EU) 
member states has voted in favour of imposing enhanced definitive 
anti-dumping duties as proposed by the Commission on imports of all 
types of bedlinen originating from Pakistan.
    
According to a message received here on Saturday, 14 out of 15 
member states of European Commission (EC) on October 16 voted in 
favour of the proposal to impose definitive duties in the range of 
6.9 per cent to 8.2 per cent on imports of bedlinen from Pakistan.
    
Estimated annual export of bedlinen from Pakistan to EU states 
comes to around 27,000 tons amounting to a value of around $200 
million. 
   
The export of bedlinen which also falls under quota category stood 
at 74 per cent upto September and normally entire quota is utilized 
by Pakistan upto December 31 of each year.
    
According to details, the Commission proposed final duty in the 
range of zero percentage to 8.2 per cent for individual companies, 
for non-cooperating companies the punitive margin has been fixed at 
8.2 per cent, but for cooperating companies the dumping margin has 
been enhanced by 0.4 per cent to 6.9 per cent.
    
These definitive duties proposed by the Commission and approved by 
overwhelming majority of member states will come into effect once 
they are notified in the official journal of the EC, and according 
to some estimates they would be effective before the year is out. 
However, handloom bedlinen imports are not affected by these 
dumping margins.

<a name="hubp">Hub Power and PTCL battered, fall-out of HK crisis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 24: Hub-Power and PTCL on Friday came in for fresh 
battering, what analysts called the fall-out of Wednesday's crash 
of the Hong Kong stock market, pushing the KSE 100-share index by 
two per cent or 33.52 points at 1,980.68.
 
"The breach of the psychological barrier of 2,000 points just in 
two sessions reflect that the market is still playing on a terribly 
weak wicket as investors are not inclined to hold long positions 
even in the pivotals," said a leading broker adding "the euphoria 
created by devaluation or IMF approval of a credit line of $1.6 
billion faded just in no time."
    
They said most of the leading shares and current favourites are 
playing with an either-way range of Rs 3 as investors prefer to buy 
and take profits within this range without taking any undue risk.
    
Some analysts did not rule out the possibility of a big inflow of 
foreign funds in shares as local stocks offer an appreciable 
capital gain in a shortest possible time.
    
"The market has the capacity to rise 15 to 20 per cent but it needs 
positive background news including political peace," they added.
    
The market has already 8.7 per cent devaluation of the rupee, which 
could attract any amount of foreign buying, and added to it is a 
big boost to Pakistan's credit rating on the world financial 
markets after the IMF approval for a three-year credit line of $1.6 
billion, dealers said.
    
However, investors both local and foreign are still shaky about the 
future share outlook and are not inclined to make long-term 
commitment and until they stay on the performance of the market 
might remain volatile.
 
The KSE 100-share index was last quoted at 1,980.68 as compared to 
2,014.20 a day earlier as leading base shares fell further.
    
The market capitalization also suffered a fresh setback of Rs 8.829 
billion at Rs 592.750 billion as against the previous Rs 601.579 
billion, falling below the resistance level of Rs 600 billion.
    
Minus signs were strewn all over the list as leading shares came in 
for fresh selling at the higher levels and finished with an 
extended fall amid active trading.
    
Energy shares again led the market decline falling sharply under 
the lead of Pakistan Oilfields, which shed another Rs 10 on renewed 
post-dividend selling. Southern Electric, Pakistan Refinery, PSO, 
Sui Southern and Japan Power were among the other major losers.
    
Bank shares, which have been active demand in the post-devaluation 
sessions, also came in for strong selling and were marked down, 
major losers among them being MCB, Al-Towfeek Bank, Prime Bank and 
Faysal Bank.
    
Other leading shares which fell included Lakson Tobacco, Pakistan 
Tobacco, Knoll Pharma and Engro Chemicals, falling by one rupee to 
Rs 2. Leading gainers were led by Grays of Cambridge, Delta 
Insurance, KESC, Pakistan Cables, Glaxo-Wellcome, Fauji Fertilizer 
and Lever Brothers, which rose by 75 paisa to Rs 10.
    
Trading volume fell below the 100 million shares mark at 79.166 
million shares as leading investors stayed on the sidelines owing 
partly to weekend considerations.
    
There were 187 actives which came in for trading out of which 108 
shares fell, 41 rose with 38 holding on to the last levels.
    
Hub-Power again topped the list of most actives, lower 95 paisa on 
27.270 million shares, followed by PTCL, easy Rs 1.15 on 24.139 
million shares, ICI Pakistan, steady 10 paisa on 11.156 million 
shares, Southern Electric, off Rs 1.05 on 2.206 million shares, and 
FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, easy 20 paisa on 1.977 million shares.
    
The other actively traded shares were led by KESC, up Rs 1.10 on 
1.787 million shares, followed by Japan Power, easy 20 paisa on 
1.646 million shares, Bank of Punjab, unchanged on 1.32 million 
shares, Sui Northern, off 70 paisa on 0.830 million shares, and 
MCB, off Rs 2.10 on 0.782 million shares. There were several other 
notable deals also.
    
DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Trading on this counter remained dull as only 
Gammon Pakistan came in for trading and was quoted further higher 
by five paisa at Rs 5.95 on 500 shares.
    
DIVIDEND: Balochistan Wheels, cash 15 per cent, First Paramount 
Modaraba, 10 per cent, Pakistan Oilfields, final 15 per cent, 15 
per cent interim already paid for the year ended June 30, 1997.

<a name="theb">The bare bones: autumn 1997</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE first of this series on my talks with Shahid Husain was printed 
in September 1995, just before he retired as a Senior Executive 
Vice-President of the World Bank. Now, on October 15, whilst on his 
way back to the United States we had another conversation and this 
is what he had to say:
    
"I am less pessimistic than I was two years ago. Then I saw 
unparalleled corruption and a total disregard for the national 
interest. Today I do feel that the head of government has his feet 
firmly on the ground and wants to do good by the country. The 
question is: Has he the means to do so, will he have the time, and 
does he have his priorities right?
    
"The most important factor about Pakistan, when I look back at the 
past 50 years, is the continuing inexorable decay of its 
institutions. There are big buildings, innumerable public 
functionaries, but the government as a functioning system has 
ceased to exist. The extreme example is WAPDA, but that is just one 
of many.
    
"The questions that you put two years ago when you wrote 'The bare 
bones' are still valid, and if you are a common man in Pakistan and 
you pay taxes you have a right to ask these questions.
    
"Do you get security for yourself and your family? Do you get 
education for your children? Does the government provide health 
facilities?
    
"Unfortunately, the answers to all three are still 'No', and there 
are no signs of an early redress.
    
"The second most important factor is that the government has lost 
its fiscal capacity. Every time taxes have been raised, the 
government has collected less in real terms. By its own estimates, 
fifty per cent of the potential tax receipts are lost through 
corruption or straight evasion. The situation is so bad that after 
debt servicing and defence spending nothing is left for the 
fulfilment of the essential functions of the government. Some 
fiscal sanity has been achieved, largely by slashing the 
development programmes.
    
"The third important factor is the tremendous centralization. The 
provincial governments, particularly that of Sindh, have neither 
the financial capacity nor the administrative capacity to fulfil 
their functions.
    
"Given these, while the immediate haemorrage has to be stopped, the 
government has to take a long view. It has to undertake a sustained 
programme of institutional rehabilitation � which means that a much 
smaller government, possibly half the present one, has to be made 
more effective and nimble. It has to improve its collection while 
reducing the number of taxes. It has to decentralize and build up 
provincial and local governments.
    
"The damage done by the two Bhuttos to the system has to be 
reversed. Public services have to be reconstituted on the basis of 
competition and competence. Salaries have to be improved massively, 
so that inadequate pay can no longer be an excuse for corruption. 
The leaders have to understand that in this day and age good 
organization and good administration means decentralisation, and 
mainly the improvement of the capacity of provincial governments 
and the constitution of local governments in large cities, 
particularly Karachi.
    
"An institutional rehabilitation cannot be sustained in the absence 
of a functional system of education. Central and provincial 
governments have to undertake a major effort to improve basic and 
technical education. They must also rcognize that private 
educational institutions are essential to fill the gap left by the 
government. There should be no restrictions on private educational 
institutions. The quality may vary, but let the market decide, as 
the government is in no position to manage a public system.
    
"Rehabilitation of the tax machinery is critical. Tax collection 
will not improve simply by hitting the CBR on the head at the end 
of each quarter, or by twisting the arms of those who already pay 
high taxes. The management of institutions can only improve with an 
improved quality of people, the motivation of those involved, and 
an improvement in systems and processes. Therefore, the government 
has to think in terms of not just one quarter, but in terms of five 
to ten years of fundamental reform in tax administration.
    
"In countries like France and Japan, top civil servants are 
assigned to tax collection. The old ICS had its roots in tax 
collection. The economy was then agriculture-based and an ICS 
officer started as an assistant collector, moving up to become a 
collector � a collector of land revenue.
    
"Now that tax collection is the highest economic priority, let our 
tax collectors be chosen through competition, let them be trained 
well and thoroughly, and, above all, let them be paid such salaries 
that they cannot be pressured or reduced to corruption. It is 
imperative that these salaries are linked to those paid in the 
private financial sector. Then and then only can the government 
take away security of service and sack them at the slightest whiff 
of corruption or inefficiency.
    
"While the immediate task is financial rehabilitation, it is 
critical not to forget that policies do not have feet of their own. 
They survive and work only if you have functioning institutions. We 
do not have them. Thus, a major effort to build them must be 
sustained.
    
"The prime minister should ask himself again and again and again: 
Do I have a team for all this? If he does not, let him find and 
assemble around him men and women who can help him. The worst 
damage he can do is to once again become a victim to party hacks 
and to people whose experience is largely bureaucratic.
 
"Can he deliver the goods? Yes, but it is all dependent on the 
quality of those around him.
    
"Does he have the required people? At the moment, no. In my view, 
in the entire government the man with the best foresight is the PM 
himself. In meetings, I have seen him show far more common sense 
than those around him.
    
"The biggest tragedy for this government is that the Muslim 
League's three years of opposition were not used to chalk out a 
strategy for the future. Look at the British Labour Party. They 
moved immediately, with determination and with speed, to put into 
force the plan they came in with. They swiftly brought about 
fundamental changes, including devolution.
    
"His second tragedy is the quality of people in the cabinet and in 
the legislature. He has not included many new faces. He has around 
him the people who were largely responsible for the failure of his 
government in 1993. Unless there is a fundamental change of the 
actors, the prime minister's future and the future of Pakistan is 
at risk. Here again he has to learn from the British Labour Party. 
Tony Blair came with a new crew and got rid of figures who were 
responsible for past failures.
    
"Another threat to this government will be the loss of its sense of 
priority and the opening up of all sorts of unnecessary fronts, 
thus detracting from necessary fundamental reforms. The prime 
minister must not forget his historical opportunity and his 
historical task. All will go to waste unless he concentrates on the 
fundamental tasks. Right now, he has no real cabinet, no competent 
team.
    
"Unfortunately, far too many people in Pakistan believe in magic 
and believe that God is on their side. They forget that God has 
made a universe of cause and effect and unless this is understood, 
political management will not improve. The essence of good 
government is the limit of discretion.
    
"Private initiative does not thrive in an environment of 
uncertainty and if we adopt policies that keep changing, then no 
planning is possible. Under the British system of taxation, one 
fine morning the budget is unveiled and is good for only one year. 
In the old days when the government role was limited, this worked. 
But today with the government role being so vast and all-
encompassing, the system of budget-making must change. A move to 
the American system under which there are no changes for at least 
five years would be a good idea.
    
"Security of the economic environment can only come when 
arbitrariness in government is banished. Tax and policy changes 
should be few and far between, there must be no discretion and such 
things as SROs must go."
    
"I agree with you," I said. "Now, would you agree with my 
interpretation of what you saw, felt, and smelt last week in that 
alien city of Islamabad?" I asked.
    
* That Nawaz Sharif seemingly has the will, but not the team, to 
mount a salvage operation.
    
* That Nawaz Sharif's priorities need to be sharpened and narrowed, 
with a heavy focus on the reconstruction of institutions.
    
* That to encourage investments, policies, taxes, utility charges 
will have to remain firm for three to five years.
    
* That there are no short-cuts, that the very shortest period 
required to revive the economy and bring it close to zero again 
would be at least five years of sustained effort, and that too, by 
a very competent team."
    
Shahid agreed.

<a name="wate">Water, water everywhere....</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

A DECADE after the mantra of privatization entered the public 
policy lexicon, it is fair to ask what magic this panacea has 
wrought, and how it has affected our lives.
    
Curiously very little, is the answer. Prices have continued 
spiralling upwards; the quality of goods and services has remained 
shoddy; and increased competition has not resulted in a better deal 
for the consumer. But if things haven't got any better, they 
haven't got much worse. However, this state of affairs may be about 
to change: with the impending privatization of the Karachi Water 
and Sewerage Board (KWSB), those of us condemned to live in Karachi 
will soon feel the private sector's lash in right earnest.
    
One argument given for flogging the family silver was that the 
money raised would pay off our mountain of debts. To the best of my 
knowledge, this has not happened. Another reason given for the 
indecent haste with which successive governments have been trying 
to sell off every asset in sight is that the private sector, being 
more efficient than the state, will be able to produce goods and 
services more cheaply; this, combined with greater competition, 
would result in lower prices. Obviously, our official spokesmen 
forgot to give a dose of this gospel to our entrepreneurial class 
because prices have continued to gallop far ahead of incomes.
    
Next, the losses incurred by state enterprises and ultimately borne 
by the taxpayer would be halted; however, this has not happened 
because entrepreneurs have bid only for profitable units, leaving 
the loss-making ones in the hands of the state. Finally, the 
private sector is supposed to be ploughing profits back in the form 
of new plant and machinery, thus generating new jobs and serving as 
the engine of development. Welcome to the real world. Rather than 
creating new jobs, we have been axing them at a prodigious rate.
    
But of all the utilities to privatize, water is a curious choice 
because in a sense, it is already mostly in the hands of the 
private sector, at least in Karachi.For years now, millions of the 
city's citizens have been making their own arrangements for the 
supply of water. The affluent pay through their nose for tankers 
and for bottled water, while the poor line up for hours with 
containers before community taps which occasionally spew forth the 
precious liquid. Indeed, the first word my nephew Nadir uttered was 
"tanker." For years now, we have been paying our water bills (which 
have risen four-fold in the last decade) in addition to the 
payments we make to the tanker mafia.
    
Given the inherent inefficiency and leakages in the system, it is 
no surprise that the KWSB should be running at a loss (nearly Rs 
600 million last year). In order to transfer these and any future 
losses to the subscriber (i.e., you and me), the government is 
actively pursuing a policy to transfer the assets and 
responsibilities of the Board to a private company. Actually, I am 
often surprised by the public's willingness to pay the KWSB's bills 
at all, given the fact that it hasn't supplied piped water to 
entire neighbourhoods for years.
    
Nevertheless, over a period of time, we have invested billions of 
rupees into the system. Now the government � at the prodding of the 
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank � has in principle 
decided to hand over the Board to a private company, and permit the 
operator to jack up water rates at 20% per year for five years, and 
the company will be given the right to free use of the KWSB assets 
for 20 years. The rationale behind this strategy is that the 
private sector will be able to invest in the progressive expansion 
and improvement of the system, using the money they accumulate from 
us.
    
But what is to stop the private utility company from raking in 
profits without making any real investments? Given the weakness and 
corruption prevalent in all our overweight agencies, there is a 
real danger that we will be ripped off by these privateers (an 18th 
century expression for pirates) as well as the tanker mafia while 
still getting substandard water. The poor, of course, will have to 
fend for themselves as best as they can. So what else is new?
    
So basically, what we are facing in the near future is a major 
municipal asset being handed over gratis to an agency that will be 
virtually free to charge us what it will, while we have to pay for 
tankers as well, or queue for hours, depending on our bank balance. 
So if the government doesn't get a penny, and we end up paying 
more, who will benefit? No prizes for the right answer. 
Understandably, many foreign utility companies have expressed an 
interest in cashing in on this bonanza.
    
During the frenzied privatization in the UK under Thatcher, many 
water boards were broken up and sold off. In the last decade, 
prices have gone up enormously, and the quality of water has 
certainly not improved. Many less affluent users can no longer 
afford the luxury of maintaining even small gardens. A recent news 
item in this newspaper informed us that the number of rats in 
Britain had increased dramatically over the last few years; 
scientists have ascribed this phenomenon to the fact that 
privateers are not investing in the eradication of rodents to 
anywhere near the extent the public sector utility service had.
    
Ultimately, there is a conflict between private profits and the 
public good. Raising water rates cumulatively by 300% over the next 
five years will undoubtedly be good for business, but how about 
giving the consumer a break? The whole exercise has been marked by 
secrecy and undue haste. A decision of this importance and 
magnitude should not be taken before extensive consultations, 
public debate and discussion. After all, we have been coping with 
the KWSB's inefficiency for years, and paying for their non-
existent services as well.
    
So what's the rush now? It's not that the government will get a 
windfall overnight: the proposal prepared by Banque Paribas and 
William Halcrow, consultants to the Sindh government (at a fee of a 
million dollars), calls for a 20-year period in which the KWSB 
system will be exploited free of charge. All in all, we need to 
think through the far-reaching implications of this proposal very 
carefully, and not let foreign agencies decide for us.
    
Much of the information used in this article has been researched by 
Dr Aly Ercelawn and his colleagues at the Creed Alliance, a group 
dedicated to serving the public interest. They have voiced their 
concern and criticism of this mad-cap scheme in this and other 
publications. Perhaps they could kick off a discussion by appearing 
on TV for a debate with the KWSB officials.
    
It would appear that for Islamabad, Karachi's many woes are of its 
own making, and therefore not deserving of any federal funding. I 
am sure when there are water riots here, our lords and masters will 
echo the Queen of France's immortal advice ("Let them eat cake!") 
to Parisians when they took to the streets over the shortage of 
bread: "Let them drink Ava!"

<a name="terr">Terror remains untamed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aziz Siddiqui

THERE were two aspects to Arif Iqbal Bhatti's killing in Lahore 
earlier this month. One was the blasphemy law which apparently was 
at the root of the murder; the other was terrorism, the instrument 
of his death.
    
Justice Bhatti, it will be remembered, was the senior member of the 
Lahore High Court bench that admitted the appeal of Salamat Masih 
and Rehmat Masih against their conviction by a lower court for 
alleged blasphemy. That was more than two years ago, in February 
1995. The bench heard the appeal on consecutive days in a highly 
charged atmosphere. Before that attempts had been made on the lives 
of the accused, and a third one among them, Manzur Masih, had died 
of his injuries from one such attempt just outside the court 
promises a few months earlier. During the appeal, menacing mobs 
collected outside and around the court and kept up a denunciatory 
chant while the session lasted. On one occasion the car of the 
defence lawyer Asma Jahangir was vandalised and she herself had to 
be placed under police protection.
    
Inside the courtroom, in addition to hearing the advocate general 
and the counsels of the two sides the court invited a number of 
eminent lawyers of Lahore to assist it. As it happened, all but one 
of these amici curiae found that it was a case of no evidence.
    
After their release Salamat Masih and Rehmat Masih had to quietly 
seek asylum abroad because of certain danger to their lives. But 
for some others that was not the end of the story. In one plot 
against advocates Asma Jahangir and Hina Jilani, a group from a 
fanatical organisation stole into their house early one morning 
along with a haversack filled with instruments good for shooting, 
slaying and strangulation. The sisters and their families were 
saved by a combination of wholly fortuitous circumstances. 
Subsequent police investigations revealed details of the horrific 
plan and the people behind it. The principal culprit however, 
though identified, was never caught.  The senior judge of the High 
Court bench meanwhile kept receiving dire threats, as his widow has 
now revealed. They kept coming to the last. Why despite this he was 
not provided police protection, for whatever it was worth, is not 
known. After his death there were efforts to divert speculation 
about the killer's motive from the more obvious 'blasphemy' 
episode. Property dispute or sectarian malice was suggested as the 
likelier cause.
    
Was it likely for a religious gripe to be nursed for over two 
years? Mob frenzy may have a short span of life, but fanatical 
grouse rabidly held usually endures for as long as the score is not 
settled. Especially so if the grouse springs from the very purpose 
of existence of its holder. Apparently those that had vowed 
retribution at the time of the court judgment did not forget their 
resolve with the passage of time.
    
Their principal target, the alleged blasphemers, had escaped both 
the mischief of the law and their own sentence. The boys' lawyers, 
Asma and Hina, were next in line. But the mischief against them got 
aborted and the would-be killers themselves got exposed. The 
latter's attention then turned to the judge. Retired, he was no 
longer in the public eye and disposing of him must have seemed in 
the present circumstances unlikely to cause public stir or any 
embarrassment to the government. It was unlikely therefore to lead 
to any discomfort to themselves. If that was indeed the calculation 
it proved not to be far wrong. The murder has hardly had an 
aftermath.
    
Such 'holy' killers also often bide their time until someone 
sympathetic to their creed gets appointed to a position of official 
proximity to their intended act and can thus preempt any heat 
straying their way. Bullying fanaticism exists in pockets in almost 
every society. But usually it acquires spunk and converts to 
murderous activism only where it is certain of clandestine official 
support, connivance, indifference or incompetence. The graph of its 
incidence here over the past years can almost directly be related 
to combinations of the above factors. The unholy warrior is unlike 
the common crook. He often needs a silent partner in crime to urge 
him on and to brace him against contingencies.
    
The law minister claimed in a Dawn interview that his recent anti-
terrorism law had brought the average of daily killings from 10-15 
before the law to five after it. He was either being incredibly 
naive or plainly disingenuous.
    
First, incidence of terrorism is not measured between one month and 
the next. It is in the nature of it to occur in waves. There were 
ebbs down to that supposedly satisfactory figure of five even in 
the worst days of terrorism.
    
Secondly, the problem is terrorism as such, not just the numbers 
dead. A society is about as sick if a hundred are killed in a 
month, month after month, as when twice or thrice that number is 
eliminated. The canker thrives in one instance as much as it does 
in the other.
    
Thirdly, even if the drop in the numbers proves stable that is not 
necessarily an indication that the evil is beginning to be brought 
under control. Fewer victims may even be a sign of worsening of the 
situation if the terrorists have improved their skills and 
resources sufficiently to zero in on their targets rather than kill 
indiscriminately. Ask the lawyers themselves. Eighteen of their 
community have been picked up in less than as many months, and at a 
rate not much different after the law than before it.
    
The message to them � and the effect on them � has been: hands off. 
They have resolved not to accept cases of alleged terrorism. They 
had already been averse to getting engaged in cases of alleged 
blasphemy. Thus the scope for them has been narrowing and the 
prospects for the accused of various categories and for the due 
process of law has been under threat from both the law and the law-
breakers.
    
Finally, if granted that the situation has improved what proof that 
this is the result of the law the minister feels so proud of 
(though earlier when the law was new and under fire he had tried to 
put a certain distance between it and himself)? Did the other laws 
that a colleague of his had cited as parallels, India's TADA and 
Britain's Elimination of Terrorism Act, put an end to 'terrorism' 
in occupied Kashmir and Northern Ireland?
    
If two months after our law a man walks into a former judge's 
office, asks for him to be sent for from the court, then on his 
arrival pumps three bullets into him and coolly walks away into the 
morning sunlight telling a man on way to go and take care of a dead 
body inside � does that indicate that the new law has begun to 
strike terror in the hearts of the terrorists? Or if a fugitive 
from the law rings up a court soon after the passage of the law and 
warns it that while the law allows seven days to an accused he, the 
outlaw, wouldn't permit a sentencing judge the respite even of a 
single day � should that afford Mr Khalid Anwar any reassurance 
about the impact of his handiwork?
    
It may be claimed that such persons are just the remnants from the 
past. But are they? Even if that is so, the brazenness those few 
are still showing should cause worry rather than permit price. They 
can yet be capable of creating incidents on a scale good enough for 
many times their number. Terrorist leadership is always, 
everywhere, confined to just a handful of persons anyway.
    
Religious terrorism in particular will not go away by just bringing 
in a more stringent law. When were even the older laws consistently 
enforced? Was it absence of a strong enough law that caused the 
lapidators of Shabqadar and the lynchers of Sargodha to freely 
stalk the neighbourhood afterwards? Or allowed those who poisoned 
Tahir Iqbal in his prison cell or killed Manzur Masih in daylight 
bazar to remain unpunished? Or let the false accusers of Gul Masih 
or Salamat Masih, Manzur Masih and Rehmat Masih to remain 
unquestioned? Or kept outlaws like Riaz Bisra and Raza Konain in 
defiant, terrorising freedom. Or prevented the seminarian nurseries 
of sectarian hatred from being purged? Did the sectarian killers of 
the past go free just because there was no law to bring retribution 
to them, and those who poured sectarian poison or mouthed 
denunciation of public-spirited activists as kafirs and wajibul 
qat'l, did they have their way because there was no law to silence 
them? Only if the answer to these were a yes there might have been 
room for a new law.
    
The government may soon be tested some more. Religious parties like 
the Jama'at-i-Islami and the JUI, the one credited with launching 
the Taleban on the world, are just now reviving up to make their 
political presence massively felt. What they may end up doing is to 
create an atmosphere conductive to the more irresponsible and 
extremist elements' beginning to revel in a feel of militant power 
and self-glorifying intolerance. Should that happen this government 
does not seem equipped to make an appropriate response to it.
    
Few apart from Mr Khalid Anwar will doubt that if the national 
leadership remains as funky about religious terror as in the past 
no anti-terrorist law will do any good. On the other hand, if the 
attitude becomes firmer no terrorist law will be necessary, with or 
without its obnoxious features.
    
Indeed how many of our crop of political leaders have denounced 
religious bigotry as manifested in the late Arif Iqbal Bhatti's 
killing? That is one measure of how insidious terror reigns here.

<a name="poor">Poor planning exposed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

Promoting the game is one thing and running it properly, another. 
In case of Pakistan which is now considered to be one of the top-
ranking cricket playing nations along with Australia, South Africa 
and West Indies, the game is being reduced to mediocrity through 
mindless planning and lop-sided itineraries of a touring team.
 
When a new cricket board was set up on a professional line with a 
full time chief executive, an administrator and a marketing expert 
one would have assumed that things would change for the better and 
the game would be richer for it. The players of the home team and 
the visitors will be saved the rigours of unnecessary travel in the 
country and established centres with proper facilities would be 
used for the bigger matches like the Tests and the smaller ones for 
the one-day and side games. But things remain as shabby as they 
have always been.
 
Millions of rupees have been spent on renovations of the centres 
like Qaddafi Stadium Lahore and National Stadium Karachi and yet a 
test has been given to Sheikhupura which has no hotel for the home 
or the visiting team and no convenient or comfortable mode of 
travelling to the place. Staying in a hotel in Lahore and 
travelling every day for at least three hours for the Test is not 
what a modern day cricketer or a spectator relishes.
 
In an age of satellite, things travel fast, matches are beamed to 
numerous countries and then the commentators indulge in their 
favourite past time of showing the pars of the city to the world to 
give them the opportunity to visit the place and the country. I do 
not think that a place like Sheikhupura offers much except that it 
would leave a rather poor image of a country which is much prettier 
than that.
 
Why is it that countries like England, Australia, South Africa, new 
Zealand, West Indies play their Tests against visiting teams at 
established centres and not at some remote and unknown place like 
Waga Waga or Towoomba or in Torguay or at St Nevis or St Kitts. 
Only because places like that do not cater for an international 
event. As far as watching cricket is concerned they get it on the 
television anyway and those who are keen enough do travel to 
established Test centres with the charm of not only seeing the 
match but also experience the hustle and bustle of a big city.
 
The notion that taking Tests to smaller places and towns would fill 
the grounds and that the game will spread in remote pars of the 
country is wishful thinking. Television and broadcasting has spread 
the game in every corner of the countries where it is played. The 
interest generated through it is much wider than staging a Test in 
a smaller place on the pretence of promoting the game.
 
Places like Sheikhupura and Gujranwala, Sialkot and Hyderabad where 
no proper facilities of international standard exist should be 
given only a one-day game at the most till they are able to provide 
the type of facilities that the modern players have become used to.
 
What happened at Sheikhupura on Friday made a poor impression about 
the state of this game facilities-wise in this country. Primitive 
pitch covers and mopping up facilities ruined the chances of any 
play on the first day and that certainly is not a pleasant 
experience for the players or for the people who must have accepted 
all kind of travelling difficulties to get there.

<a name="pitc">Pitch drying operation embarrassing </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Zafar Samdani

LAHORE, Oct 20: Few sights at a sports ground could be as ugly and 
pathetic and as embarrassing for hosts as the pitch drying 
operations in Sheikhupura on Friday last, the first day of 
Pakistan's second cricket test against South Africa. But even worse 
were possibly the causes creating that situation and utter 
indifference of all who should have been concerned and ashamed.

The wicket got watered by nature as protective arrangements proved 
woefully inadequate, inefficient and non-professional. Rain water 
had seeped through the covers; their condition was obviously not 
checked till the time for unfolding them. Even then the moth eaten 
or rodden chewed state of the covers did not upset any one. Make 
shift last moment measures, for which the locals distinguish 
themselves in all fields, to plug holes and ensure that the pitch 
was not affected, could have been undertaken. That too was not done 
with the result that the start of the test was delayed by more than 
five sessions.
    
The covers were not required all of a sudden. The test match in 
Sheikhupura was scheduled months back. But it did not occur to 
anyone to find out the quality of professional facilities available 
at the venue though endless meetings must have been held to review 
arrangements. The focus of such meetings is invariably or law and 
order, sale of tickets, contracts for the sale of eatables and 
permission to vendors to turn the stands in to the kind of sale 
points that offer questionable food at bus stops for inter district 
transport and of course comforts for spectators meriting VIP 
treatment. Every city of Pakistan has its socially and politically 
sensitive personalities. Officials of the administration head such 
inventories. That the event was to be a test match between cricket 
teams of Pakistan and another country was apparently 
inconsequential to the organisers of the match and managers of the 
sport.
    
In this attitude of misplaced priorities anything could happen. On 
the current visit of the South African cricket team, one test 
centre had already produced unpleasant scenes. In the first test at 
Rawalpindi, entry was made free at one point to ensure a good 
gathering for the royal visitors from England. That caused a baton 
charge on a segment of the spectators. Covers for the pitch had 
proved problematic in Rawalpindi too. Earlier, during the visit of 
India's cricket team to Pakistan for a three-match series of one 
dayers, stone throwing incidents had marred the proceedings at 
Karachi while the last encounter in Lahore produced, besides 
thrilling cricket, almost unprecedented mismanagement which saw 
ticket holders lose out to free loaders, present in all stands, 
courtesy the police. The quality of professional facilities did not 
come under pressure and was hence not exposed. It is however 
doubtful if Hyderabad had come out unscathed if a demand was made 
on the management. Karachi and Lahore may have survived a challenge 
because they are major centres of cricket and consequently better 
organised. Even so, it is a question if these centres could be 
favourably compared with major grounds in other cricket playing 
countries.
    
More regrettable is the aftermath of the clumsy handling of the 
situation in Sheikhupura. Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) does not 
regard itself responsible because the ground is not under its 
control. But are professional facilities, at least reviewing their 
availability and quality, also outside PEB's jurisdiction? The 
district administration in Sheikhupura can not be treated as 
qualified for managing such matters but should it not have asked 
PCB to extend a helping professional hand? PCB may not have 
administrative control over grounds but pitches are prepared under 
its supervision; during test matches, they could be maintained by 
the Board too.
    
The sum total is that every one has slipped. But at a time when the 
cacophony of accountability has reached a deafening level no one 
seems to be accountable for the terrible mess at Sheikhupura. The 
games which where played there was neither accountability nor 
cricket; they were passing the buck and sweeping things under the 
rug, in this case, under the covers. But the cover had holes and 
caused seepage.

KARACHI, Oct 20: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has summoned United 
Bank President, Zubair Soomro, and Senior Executive Vice President, 
Khalid A Sherwani, to Islamabad.

Sources added that Soomro and Sherwani, a former UBL chief, were 
due to call on Nawaz Sharif anytime Monday. However, the sources 
were unaware of the agenda of the meeting.
    
Nevertheless, it is anticipated that the crucial meeting concerns 
to the sacking of 7,500 employees, including 13 cricketers and four 
hockey players.
    
Amongst the 13 cricketers is Waqar Younis who three years ago was 
given a state award for his meritorious services for the country 
and promotion of the game.
    
Besides Younis, also sacked are Tauseef Ahmad (bank's team captain 
who has taken 99 Test wickets), Inzamamul Haq (who has scored more 
than 2,500 runs in Tests and 3,500 runs in one-day internationals), 
and Mushtaq Ahmad (who has 120 Test wickets and more than 100 
wickets in one-dayers).
    
Former paceman Salim Jaffar, discarded Basit Ali, new Test cap 
Mohammad Ramazan were also fired by the bank on the grounds that 
they were either appointed after Oct 1, 1991 or were given 
promotions out-of-turn.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Oct 23: Squash legend Jahangir Khan, the record ten-time 
winner of the British Open and six times former world champion, 
today expressed his great concern and disappointment over the 
termination of services of World-fame sportsmen who brought honour 
and glory for Pakistan.
    
Talking to Dawn, Jahangir Khan stated that termination of services 
of Pakistan's world -renowned cricketers such as Waqar Younis, 
Inzamamul Haq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Basit Ali and good number other 
emerging and potential test cricketers would have a negative effect 
on our national sports. There is a general apprehension among the 
sportsmen and also among the sportswomen, serving in various 
government and other organisations, that they might be awaiting the 
same fate as the cricketers.
    
The former world champion said that he was sad at the dismissal of 
the who have rendered tremendous services to Pakistan's sports. It 
was a very unkind act by those who with a stroke of pen did away 
with the services of Pakistan sports heros, stated the Khan.
    
Terrmination of sportsmen, in the name of downsizing, is not the 
solution of the problem, he stressed. There is a way to handle the 
issue, particularly of the sportsmen, who have given their best for 
the honour of the country. While millions of people in Pakistan and 
outside the country had watched them in action.

ISLAMABAD, Oct 23: Former Pakistan cricket captain Wasim Akram on 
Thursday served a legal notice on Pak Suzuki Motors asking the firm 
to pay Rs. 50 million for "illegally" using his name.
    
"Our client is astonished and shocked to note that your company has 
promoted its corporate name and products by illegally using the 
picture of our client's world famous bowling action," Barrister 
Kamaluddin Azfar stated in the legal notice served on behalf of 
Wasim Akram.
    
Life-size pictures of Wasim Akram are displayed in prominent 
accredited showrooms of Pak Suzuki Motors throughout Karachi and 
elsewhere, he said adding that this illegal action was in full 
concurrence of Pak Suzuki to the detriment of his client.
    
"Our client is one of the world's top few sportsmen and is 
recognized to be one of all-time great allrounders in the game of 
cricket," Mr. Azfar said.
    
Mr. Azfar pointed out that cricket was one of the most popular 
games in Pakistan, United Kingdom, Australia, India, New Zealand, 
West Indies, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Hong Kong, Canada and 
Bangladesh and as a cricket star Wasim Akram was watched by 
millions on television in international matches throughout the 
world.

<a name="germ">German coach to train soccer players</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, Oct 23:  The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) is making 
arrangement to hire a German soccer coach to train the National 
team. This was stated by M.N. Jehan, chief selector, PFF here on 
Thursday.
    
The standard of football has witnessed a steady decline in Pakistan 
since the Dhaka fall in 1971. This was stated by the  (PFF) chief 
selector M N Jehan while talking to Dawn on Thursday.
    
M N Jehan who was also the captain of the Pakistan team in 60s said 
that like Calcutta, Dhaka had been awarding lucrative cash prizes 
to the footballers. But, after the debacle, the Pakistani players 
lost the opportunity which resulted in horrible decline of standard 
of the game in Pakistan.
    
He said in 60s Pakistan was among the top football nations of Asia. 
Pakistan had also played the final of the Asian championship in 
1965 but lost it to Japan, he said.
    
With the passage of time, Pakistan lost its ranking due to poor 
planning and insufficient incentives for footballers, while the 
other Asian countries continued their struggle and now they were 
far ahead of Pakistan, he said.
