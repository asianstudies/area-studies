<a name="deat">Death for possession of illicit weapons</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, March 7: The government has imposed death penalty or life 
imprisonment for those transporting, selling or carrying unlicensed 
automatic weapons including Klashnikov.
    
The death penalty or life imprisonment has been imposed by amending 
Pakistan Arms Ordinance 1965 and inserting a new Section 13-A in to it.
    
A penalty for transportation of arms etc:- (a) transports, sells or keeps, 
offers or exposes for sale, a cannon, grenade, rocket launcher, missile, 
machine-gun, sub-machine-gun, dynamite or detonator, or ammunition which 
can be fired from such arms, or goes armed with abovesaid weapons 
unlicensed or has in possession or control the above weapons and ammunition 
shall be sentenced to death or imprisonment for life and his movable or 
immovable property shall be forfeited, according to the newly- added 
section.
    
It said that anyone carrying, selling or transporting the above said arms 
or ammunition in contravention of section 8 of the said Ordinance, which 
bars any person going armed except under a licence, shall be punishable 
with death or life imprisonment.
    
Similarly, any contravention of Section 9 of the same ordinance also 
carries the same sentence. Section 9 says: No person shall have in his 
possession or under his control any arms, or any ammunition or military 
stores, except under a licence and in the manner and to the extent 
permitted thereby.

<a name="isla">Islamabad ready to settle issue of Siachen</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD March 1: Pakistan said it was ready to settle the issue of 
demilitarisation of Siachen in accordance with the Simla agreement.
    
A foreign office spokesman, said Pakistan had reached an agreement with 
India on the Siachen issue in 1989, but regretted that New Delhi had later 
reneged on it.
    
Responding to questions the spokesman said the issue of demilitarisation of 
Siachen glacier was not directly linked to the Kashmir problem.
    
The spokesman, commenting on the increase in the Indian defence budget, 
said: any move which may lead to increase in insecurity in the region, 
would not be a positive development.
    
The spokesman disagreed with a questioner that the Indian government led by 
Gowda was weak and might not be able to hold talks with Islamabad on 
Kashmir issue.
    
Asked whether the Indian prime ministers recent letter to Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif suggesting resumption of bilateral talks also includes the 
Kashmir disputes among the issues for discussion, the spokesman recalled 
that Prime Minister Deve Gowda had stated: We are ready and willing to 
hold wide-ranging and comprehensive talks on all issues of mutual concern, 
to which Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had responded by emphasising I hope 
you will agree that without some progress on the core issue of Jammu and 
Kashmir, it will be difficult to initiate meaningful cooperation in 
economic and cultural fields.
    
The spokesman replying to a question on so-called track-two diplomatic 
talks among non-officials of the two countries, said though the government 
had nothing to do with it, it was not opposed to it either. He said that 
the track-two diplomatic talks among honourable people whom he described 
as well-read and well-informed patriotic persons, seemed to do their best 
to help sort out issues bedevilling bilateral relations.
    
The spokesman declined to offer any comment on recent reported statement at 
a function by Federal Minister Syeda Abida Husain, alleging that Saudi 
Arabia and Iran were fighting their proxy war by whipping up sectarian 
violence in Pakistan. Both Saudi Arabia and Iran were Pakistans respected 
close friends, he said. The spokesman also issued a statement to the Press 
on the coming visit of Deputy Foreign Minister Morteza Sarmadi to Islamabad 
and said that during his visit here, the Iranian minister would also 
discuss Multan incident in which Iranian cultural centre director Mohammad 
Ali Rahimi was among seven others killed.
    
The spokesman, however, refuted news reports suggesting that Mr Sarmadi was 
coming to investigate the Multan incident. Iranian police were not called 
to assist investigations, the spokesman added. The spokesman stressed that 
the Iranian deputy foreign minister would be here in line with our resolve 
to work closely with Iran on this sensitive issue and ensure that our time-
tested ties are not affected in any way.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai 

WASHINGTON, March 2: Pakistan has been listed by the United States among 
the major money laundering countries of the world. The latest drug strategy 
report issued by the state department defines a major money laundering 
country as one whose financial institutions engage in currency transactions 
involving significant amounts of proceeds from international narcotics 
trafficking.
    
The other countries identified this year in this category are: Antigua, 
Argentina, Aruba, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Colombia, 
Costa Rica, Cyprus, Dominican Republic, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, 
Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, 
Netherlands Antilles, Nigeria, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Russia, Singapore, 
Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, the 
United Kingdom, the United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
    
Observers said most of these countries had privatised their banking systems 
which were not under the direct control of governments.

<a name="129d">129 die in Khanewal rail crash </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Abdul Sattar Qamar

MULTAN, March 3: At least 129 people, including 50 women and children, were 
killed and over 105 injured when the Karachi-bound 6-Down Zulfiqar Express 
met a catastrophic accident at Mehr Shah Railway Station some 10 kilometres 
south-west of Khanewal early on Monday morning.
    
Majority of the dead belonged to Karachi, NWFP, Gujranwala and Lahore 
division. The accident took place when the train was forced to enter a dead 
end of the loopline to avert a collision with Sialkot-bound Allama Iqbal 
Express. The cabin man tried to apply brakes but failed to stop it because 
its hydraulic brake system did not work. As a result of this the engine and 
five bogies derailed and entangled with each other.
    
According to details available here, the Zulfiqar Express left Lahore for 
Karachi via Chord Line (Khanewal-Lodhran section) at 3.40am. As it reached 
near Mehr Shah Railway Station, the driver of ill-fated train found the 
outer signal up. He pulled the hydraulic-brakes to stop the train but 
failed even to reduce its speed as the brake system was not functioning. 
The driver blew horn and gave signal through its head-lights for SOS. The 
point-man shifted the point of track towards sand-hump to save Sialkot-
bound Allama Iqbal Express. Allama Iqbal Express was entering Mehr Shah 
Railway Station at that time.
    
The engine of ill-fated train bogged down in the sand and derailed. Coaches 
No ZF 5559, 5590 and 9771 also derailed and entangled with each other. 
Another coach bearing No 9568 also derailed by all wheels while two wheels 
of the rear trolley of coach No 9958 remained on the railway track. The 
remaining 13 rear coaches remained on track.
 
Divisional Superintendent Railway, Multan, Sardar Saifullah Khan Qaiserani 
told reporters that there would have been most catastrophic accident, had 
the point-man not shifted Zulfiqar Express to sand-hump.
    
On hearing the information about the tragic accident, railway authorities 
rushed relief trains from Khanewal and Samasata to the site for rescue 
operation. The bodies of passengers were taken out of the bogies after 
lifting them with the help of a crane.
 
According to railway authorities, all traffic was diverted to Multan 
(loopline) and Zulfikar Express proceeded to Karachi at 9.50am with 13 
bogies which escaped undamaged and passengers having minor injuries also 
left for Karachi. The rail track was cleared for traffic after six hours of 
hectic efforts.
    
Some people of the area who gathered at the disaster scene told this 
correspondent that they listened a deafening noise of crash and screams of 
people. They immediately came out of their homes to know what had happened 
in their neighbourhood. They found five bogies derailed and rammed into 
each other. Then they tried to take the passengers out of bogies. One of 
the bogies was badly damaged and it was not possible for them to remove it 
without using the crane.
    
The trapped passengers were shouting for help to save them and their 
children. After an hours struggle a relief train reached the spot from 
Khanewal which started the rescue work and entangled bogies were separated.
    
The witnesses said passengers of Sialkot-bound Allama Iqbal Express and 
people at Mehr Shah Railway Station also participated in rescue work. The 
Edhi Trust provided 15 ambulances while a Korean company and health 
department also provided ambulances to bring the injured to hospitals from 
Mehr Shah.
    
Moving scenes were witnessed at the Mehr Shah Railway Station. A mother 
seemed to have turned hysterical due to the death of her two minor children 
sleeping in her lap at the time of accident.
    
Cabin man Allah Ditta told Dawn that train was moving toward Mehr Shah at a 
speed of 100 kilometre per hour and that he tried to save it from the worst 
accident by turning it to the sand-hump. But when asked why did he keep the 
train on the main track which was vacant at that time, he failed to give a 
convincing answer.
    
People of the area said it was absolutely incorrect to say that second 
track was occupied by Allama Iqbal Express coming from Karachi and said 
that both tracks were vacant and there was no justification to divert the 
train towards the sand-hump without consulting the station master or 
assistant station master.
    
A railway official who did not revealed his name said Allama Iqbal Express 
was detained at Jungle Mariala station for the  crossing of Zulfikar 
Express. He further said that brake system was correct at Khanewal railway 
station and if some fault had developed in vacuum system then there was no 
possibility of movement of locomotive even for 100 yards, he added.
    
Makhdoom Javed Hashmi, MNA from the area told reporters that it might be an 
act of sabotage. However, it would be premature to say anything about it, 
he added.
    
According to Mohammad Riaz, a resident of Burewala who received injuries in 
the accident most of the passengers became unconscious when the accident 
took place. Some railway officials said that the accident might be the 
result of subversive activity involving removal of fish plates and rail 
sleepers. Meanwhile, the villagers of nearby village and passengers of the 
train who remained safe took part in the relief operation side by side the 
railway rescue teams.

<a name="trai">Train driver says he was not fit for night duty</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

MULTAN, March 5: The driver of the Zulfikar Express, that crashed near 
Khanewal, told an inquiry team that medically he was not fit to perform 
night duty but his boss did not care and ordered him to keep on.
    
Driver Khalid Islam, admitted during cross-questioning that the divisional 
medical officer, Sukkur, had examined him on Feb. 25 last and advised him 
not to perform night duty due to high blood pressure and some symptoms of 
cancer. He further told the inquiry team, headed by the Federal Government 
Railways Inspector (FGIR), that he appeared before the divisional 
mechanical engineer, Sukkur, with the medical report but he asked him to 
perform his duties as usual.
    
Every PR staffer put the responsibility of the technical fault on the 
other. The train-examiners insisted that they had thoroughly examined the 
wheels, brakes and vacuum system of all bogies. They ruled out the 
possibility of any fault in hydraulic system of all the bogies 
simultaneously on the grounds that there was no precedence of such a fault 
in the past.
    
The inquiry team, according to sources, could not reach any conclusion. The 
preliminary departmental and magisterial inquiry report about the accident 
is being submitted to the prime minister on Thursday.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 6: The Federal Cabinet after two-days deliberations has 
finally decided to set up intelligence coordination committees at the 
provincial level to monitor, discuss and transmit vital intelligence 
information to the district level officers for pre-emptive actions.
    
It also passed draft ordinances to provide death penalty for gang rapes and 
un-natural offences on children below the age of 10 and imposition of fine 
up to Rs 3,00,000 on those holding marriage functions in violation of the 
law.
    
It was also decided in the meeting that the posting of the police officers 
would be done strictly through the Establishment Division at the central 
level and through Services and General Administration Department in the 
provinces in consultation with the concerned inspector generals of police.
    
Superintendents of Police in their respective districts will be allowed to 
post SHOs of their choice with a direction that all police officers so 
appointed will not be shifted or transferred except on disciplinary grounds 
before a period of two years. The SPs will, however, be accountable for the 
performance of the police force in their districts and be held exclusively 
responsible for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdiction. He 
said the police station would be made effective in the performance of its 
duties by making the Station House Officer accountable for any heinous or 
sensational crime committed in his jurisdiction. Failure to give a proper 
account would result in immediate action against the delinquent officer. 
Similarly, District S.P., Range DIG and IGP will be held accountable for 
heinous crimes within their respective territorial jurisdiction.
    
The punishments will include demotion, transfer or suspension.

<a name="shah">Shahid Hamid appointed Punjab governor</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 7: Pakistan Muslim League on Friday conceded to appoint 
presidents nominee Shahid Hamid as Governor of Punjab, Dawn reliably 
learnt.
    
The understanding to induct the former caretaker defence minister and a 
close confidant of President Farooq Leghari as governor was reached at a 
meeting at the Presidency on Friday.
    
The meeting was attended by Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Federal 
Minister for Population Development Abida Hussain, Petroleum Minister 
Chaudhry Nisar Ali, Shahid Hamid and Zulfiqar Khosa, an arch political 
rival of Leghari tribe.

The agreement, apparently a quid pro quo between the president and the 
Pakistan Muslim League, has also rescued the ruling party from a split as 
the president gave his nod to include Mr Khosa in the provincial cabinet. 
   
The president had also refused to induct an MQM nominee as Sindh governor 
unless his man was appointed as Punjab governor. The appointment of his man 
will also pavethe way for the appointment of the MQM man as Sindh governor.

<a name="bank">Pakistan banks in US allowed to accept donations</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NEW YORK , March 2: The US banking authorities have allowed Pakistan banks 
in the United States to open accounts and accept donations and deposits for 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs debt retirement scheme.
    
But they warned that all transactions should adhere to the US banking laws 
and that no bank would solicit donations itself directly and that any 
transaction of over 10,000 dollars would be reported to the Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS).
    
The President of National Bank of Pakistan in New York, Nabi Sher Khan, 
said that, as of Friday (Feb. 28), all Pakistan banks could accept 
donations and deposits towards the prime ministers debt retirement scheme. 
As a consequence, all National Bank branches in Washington, Chicago and New 
York will accept donations and deposits.
    
Mr Khan said that although several Pakistanis had called the bank to 
inquire about the scheme and where they could make deposits, so far there 
had been no donations or deposits made. 
   
He said the Pakistanis , willing to contribute, would not be charged any 
bank fee for any transactions. However, the other two Pakistan banks in New 
York, Habib Bank and the United Bank, were still not clear about their 
participation. The National Bank got instructions early last week to open 
such accounts here.
    
Meanwhile, in interviews with Dawn , almost all Pakistanis showed keen 
interest in donating or depositing money or give interest- free loan (Qarz-
i-Hasna) towards the prime ministers scheme. But many expressed serious 
reservations about disbursement and handling of such money . They felt that 
a proper system of accounting and managing of the funds should be 
established in order to make everything transparent. Many successful 
businessmen and professionals said: We are willing to sacrifice everything 
for our country. But we want that there should be transparency in handling 
of these funds.

<a name="impl">Implications of PMs call to expatriates</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
*From M. Ziauddin

THE poor and the downtrodden of Pakistan gave a massive mandate to Nawaz 
Sharif on February 3 to put the economy back on the rails. The Prime 
Minister, instead, has asked the rich and the affluent overseas Pakistanis 
on February 23, to help him with cash donations to meet the countrys 
immediate debt obligations which is in the range of $500 million.
    
The most optimistic projections reckon that the appeal of the Prime 
Minister for contributions and term deposits for debt retirement would 
bring in a minimum of $300 million and a maximum of $500 million by end-
June, 1997. Also, it is likely to be a one-shot item with no follow-up on 
an annual basis.
    
This projection is based on the fact that about 95 per cent of Pakistani 
overseas workers( about 3.5 million in all) is made up of manual labourers 
who are already sending in their hard-earned money to Pakistan to support 
their large families here. This amount, perhaps, around $300-400 million in 
all, comes to Pakistan annually through the Hundi system under which the 
recipient in Pakistan gets the remittances in rupees while the equivalent 
foreign exchange goes into the black economy. The overseas Pakistani 
workers have no faith in Pakistani banks and this attitude of theirs is not 
going to change over night because Pakistani banks are not equipped to 
transmit the amount to the recipients in time. In any case, these overseas 
Pakistani workers are in no position to oblige Nawaz Sharif because they 
simply cannot afford the $1000 he is asking.
    
Of the remaining 5 percent Pakistani workers abroad who can afford it, only 
1 per cent have any physical or emotional links with their mother country. 
So, according to the most conservative estimate the expected amount should 
not be anything more than $30 million. 
    
However, if the campaign is launched and conducted properly, there is a 
possibility that it would emotionally touch around 350,000 Pakistanis and 
if all of them contribute according to their respective ability, receipt of 
an amount between $500 million and $300 million does not appear to be out 
of question.
    
But, the question is: what after that? Since this amount is not going to be 
a regular annual feature of our income, how does the new government plan to 
take care of the future expenditures which are bound to go up consistently 
unless defence expenditure is rationalised and the population explosion is 
controlled to less than 2 per cent?
    
Pakistan is suffering from debt burden because we have not been able to 
earn enough to finance our galloping socio-economic and security needs. And 
the main reason for this has been the chronic problem of tax evasion. 
Between the agriculture and non-agriculture economy, there is a tax 
potential of Rs. 250 billion. But we collect a paltry Rs. 80 billion 
annually. Unless we do something drastic to reduce this massive tax 
evasion, we are likely to remain under the constant default threat.
    
It is not known why, the industrialist Prime Minister did not appeal to his 
businessmen colleagues and agricultural friends to pay their taxes honestly 
while requesting the overseas Pakistanis to contribute generously to debt 
retirement fund.
    
In the days of general Zia, every year the Pakistani business tycoons used 
to be invited to come to Islamabad just before the budget with their 
proposals. And they would come with proposals for tax exemptions. They 
would be obliged and in return they would be asked to help the government 
bridge the budgetary deficit with contributions. They would promise but 
would never keep these promises. As a result, the budgetary deficit kept on 
galloping and reached around 15 per cent of the GDP in 1988( this figure 
was fudged so as to make it appear 9.5 per cent of the GDP).
    
The Prime Minister by ignoring the real problem of the economy which is tax 
collection, has in fact contributed to further distortion of the economy, 
the price of which he may have to pay in political terms before the end of 
his tenure as did his predecessors.
    
The one welcome decision which he has announced in his February 23 speech 
concerns the promise to put a cap on the prices of electricity, gas and 
petroleum. This will certainly have an impact on cost of production and 
increase the competitiveness of Pakistani export goods. But he had more 
than nullified this decision by increasing the burden on the public sector 
budget and the cost of private sector production by increasing the salaries 
all around by Rs. 300 per month. It sounds too heartless to object to this 
paltry raise for a people who have been finding it impossible to make both 
ends meet for the last couple of years. But it is better to go without a 
meal today than to forfeit the two square meals tomorrow.
    
If the Prime Minister was really interested in stabilising the prices and 
at the same time he had wanted to initiate increased production activities, 
he should have announced a drastic cut in the import tariffs and imposed 
upto retail stage general sales tax on all consumer goods.

This would have reduced the prices of imported raw materials and 
intermediaries making it economic to produce domestically a whole range of 
items now being imported in finished form at a high dollar cost causing the 
trade gap to widen and the balance of payments position to deteriorate . 
And the GST would have taken care of consumption allowing the surpluses to 
be exported. The Prime Minister did not elaborate how he intended to revive 
production activities. If he is planning to do this by reviving the so-
called sick mills by injecting resources from the budget, then he would be 
committing the same blunder as did the government of General Zia which kept 
on throwing good money after the bad in attempting revive the sick mills 
whose owners had found it more profitable to declare their mills sick and 
pocket the bank loans. He should let the sick mills go bankrupt and allow 
the fittest to survive and make profits. By letting the sick mills 
disappear, the government would only be creating the right environment for 
the restructuring of the industrial sector which should get out of its 
traditional rut of spinning mills.
    
The need of the hour is infrastructure. Therefore, the new government 
should invite the private sector to investment in ports, roads, bridges, 
power, telecommunication, railways, airlines and road transport, rather 
than in spinning mills. Meanwhile, the government should take in hand in 
all earnestness, the process of privatisation, especially those of banks 
and investment institutions.
    
The new government seems to be suffering from a misconception that with one 
appeal from Nawaz Sharif, overseas Pakistanis would begin investing in 
Pakistan by the billions. They would if they can. But this is not such a 
simple matter. In the first place unlike overseas Chinese and overseas 
Indians the overseas Pakistanis are not as affluent. A handful of them who 
can afford it have tried in the past only to be discouraged by the local 
red tape. And this red tape is still there. Pakistani bureaucracy is 
perhaps the most visionless bureaucracy anywhere in the world. Somehow they 
have learnt only to block things. Sometime they make things difficult for 
foreign investors for cash considerations but most of the time because they 
have no understanding of the demands of modern industry.
    
Pakistans economy needs to grow at an annual average rate of around 10 per 
cent to keep pace with the population increase of 3 per cent per annum. To 
achieve this, we need to invest at the rate of 25 per cent and to obtain 
this rate of investment we need to save at the rate of around 18-20 per 
cent per annum. But the present rate of savings is 14-15 per cent.
    
In order to improve this situation in the first place we need to force the 
businessmen and agriculturists to pay their taxes honestly and secondly we 
must attract foreign direct investment as much as possible. One way of 
reducing tax evasion is to reduce the rate of taxes, but in order to ensure 
minimum tax evasion, the government of the day should have the political 
will to send the tax evader, no matter how powerful, to jail. And in order 
to attract foreign direct investment, a level playing field should be 
offered to the foreign investor instead of asking him to compete with those 
who keep double books and who make margins out of protection rather than by 
efficient production.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Teenaz Javat

There are, altogether 11 different taxes clamped on the import of books in 
Pakistan, enough to exasperate any established publisher and to put any new 
comer in the books trade out of business, within a matter of time.
    
The taxes are under different heads namely, import duty, advance income 
tax, surcharge, lending charges, stamp duty (only applicable in Sindh), 
sales tax, development surcharge and survey fee, aviation surcharge which 
comes to two percent on air freight, central excise duty, clearing charges 
and other miscellaneous charges (read bribes).
    
This has taken the cost of imported books sky-high as the freight charges 
too have escalated over the past few months, said a leading publishers 
representative based in Karachi. When we complained to the concerned 
authorities as to the bases of these taxes, we were brazenly told to 
contact the Central Board of Revenue (CBR).  When we did that, authorities 
at the CBR openly told us to contact the officials representing the World 
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Pakistan as it was they 
who had instructed the CBR to clamp the tax on imported books, moans yet 
another leading publisher who preferred to remain anonymous.
    
Going by these taxes if one were to see between the lines, the Library 
Rates Committee of the Ministry of Education, Department of Libraries has 
set out the following rates of conversion applicable for imported 
publications.
    
These rates when clamped on imported books increases the price by 16 to 20 
percent over and above the price of the book.
   
Because of this heavy taxation the selling price of a book is at the rate 
of Rs 51.66 to the US Dollar and Rs 86.19 to the pound Sterling, he added. 
Moreover, these taxes are not adjustable under any heads as there are no 
claim backs. Even the advanced income tax that the publishers pay on the 
import of the books regardless of the books being sold, there is no 
question of getting it back ever.

As the government has abducted its responsibility, the publishers 
representatives have made a submission directly to the IMF- World Bank 
representatives in Pakistan.
    
Little does the government realise that if they want to improve the economy 
they must, under any circumstances encourage education among the youth.
    
The amount allocated to education in the recent budget is probably one of 
the lowest in Asia.
   
The current increase in the cost of books have made them out of reach of 
the better part of the population. Text books must cost less. The 
government must increase its allocation on education and remove all taxes 
on this vital tool of knowledge. 
   
With the passage of time, the literacy rate in Pakistan has gone down. 
Books are the manure for the growth of the mind and instead of their sales 
increasing, this kind of harsh taxation have reduced the volume of books 
sold anything between 40 to 60 percent. 
   
This lacunae is therefore filled up by pirated versions as people will read 
only if they can afford to do so. The attitude of the government must 
change and no tool of education should be subject to such ruthless 
taxation.

<a name="ared">Are donations a substitute for reform?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem

PRIME MINISTER Nawaz Sharif has given a call to all expatriate Pakistanis 
to remit $1,000 each so that the country can boost its liquid hard currency 
reserves, reduce its dependence on foreign lenders and pay off some of its 
bloated foreign debt.
    
Senator Sartaj Aziz has reportedly drawn up a Green Bullet Scheme whereby 
Pakistanis working or settled abroad would be able to get a 8.25 percent 
rate of return on a two-year US dollar deposit, 8,50 percent for a three-
year term, 8.75 percent for four years and 9 percent for a five-year 
commitment.
    
Deposits denominated in pound sterling would be paid 9 percent for two 
years, 9.25 percent for three years, 9.50 percent on four and 9.75 percent 
for a 5-year deposit. In the case of German marks the rate of return stands 
at 6.25 percent, 6.50 percent, 6.75 percent and 7 percent for respective 
terms.
    
To be certain, there is absolutely nothing new either about the scheme 
itself or the various rates of return. Almost all banks in the country have 
been offering similar schemes with comparable rates of interest at least 
for the past 10 years.
    
The new government is simply attempting to bottle the same old pill in a 
new, patriotic bottle. Apart from such banking schemes, the Government of 
Pakistan (GOP) also has a $150 million Eurobond that actually pays 11.50 
percent semi-annually and is listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
 
Just ignoring the existence of all similar investment vehicles, proponents 
of the current scheme have forwarded estimates speculating that two million 
overseas Pakistanis would send back $2 billion. The Governor SBP, Dr 
Mohammad Yaqub, has even stepped into the debate with an estimate of around 
$1 billion.

Wishful horses
    
Let us assume, for a moment, that wishes were horses and that we would 
actually be able to attract around $1 billion in the name of loyalty alone. 
Considering that we are currently running an average trade deficit of $350 
million per month all the newly arrived money would be gone in less than 90 
days.
    
If we instead use the expatriate finds for debt servicing, then more than 
half of the billion dollars would have to be paid out by the end of March 
while the remaining half would fall short by a good $200 million for the 
payment due by the end of June (more than $500 million is due by the end of 
March and an additional $675 million falls due by the end of June).
    
Let us also say that ones love for ones country is at times directly 
proportional to how far one really is from his or her home. Let us, 
therefore, assume that hundreds of thousands of Pakistanis living thousands 
of miles away would succumb, to what would essentially equate to emotional 
coercion, and would deposit hundreds of millions of dollars with Pakistani 
banks (realistic estimates actually range between $150 million to $300 
million).
    
We, on the other hand, are sure to use up all that money either in 
financing our trade deficit, the current account deficit or debt servicing 
(there is no explicit guarantee that these funds will be used exclusively 
for debt retirement). How does the government really plan to pay these 
funds back to the original depositors as per contracted terms or at the 
time of maturity 2 or 3 years down the road? More debt? More appeals to 
loyalty and patriotism? Is the government into some sort of a pyramid 
scheme?

Opposition support
    
Benazir Bhutto, almost out of the blue, has also jumped on to the 
bandwagon. During her recent National Assembly speech she has also 
supported Nawaz Sharifs scheme of mobilising funds from overseas 
Pakistanis in order to pay off debt.
    
Do any of our leaders ever think of why overseas Pakistanis should send 
back their hard-earned dollars? Were the same overseas Pakistanis ever 
consulted when billions of dollars were being borrowed by the leaders in 
the name of alleviating domestic poverty?
    
None of that money ever trickled down to the masses but the country today 
stands indebted to the tune of $30 billion in foreign and close to Rs 1 
trillion in domestic debt.
    
Why have the leaders, in the first place, allowed the foreign debt to swell 
to 300 percent of our annual exports? As a matter of record, our foreign 
debt stood at around $12.9 billion in 1988 and has since gone up to $30 
billion, while the increase in domestic debt over the same period has been 
from Rs 333 billion to Rs 1,000 billion.
    
This means that since the advent of democracy in 1988, Benazir Bhutto and 
Nawaz Sharif during their respective terms have each been borrowing an 
average of Rs 60 crore every single day of the year just to keep their 
governments running. That translates into additional loans of Rs 50 lakh 
every waking hour of the day or nearly a lakh rupees of additional national 
debt for every waking minute.
    
What truly is the new schemes real proposition? Well, the new government 
wants Pakistanis working or settled abroad to deposit dollars with 
Pakistani banks  which shall in return increase our foreign currency 
liabilities  just so that the newly installed leaders could have enough 
dough to chew on for another quarter. Isnt the State Bank of Pakistan 
(SBP) already over-exposed on the account of resident and non-resident 
foreign currency deposits?
    
Just a few weeks ago, the SBP had reported hard currency reserves of less 
than $700 million while it owed $4 billion to resident foreign currency 
depositors and an additional $4.5 billion to non-resident foreign currency 
depositors. Why would it want to add on to its foreign currency 
liabilities?
    
Admittedly, some foreign institutional investors may also find the new 
rates of return (LIBOR plus 200 basis points) attractive enough to send in 
additional deposits. One should not ignore, however, that all such inflows 
are based on a strict risk-reward analysis and that foreign institutions 
have, in the past, been reluctant to lend us for a period of more than 9 
months. Additionally, some of the main-stream politicians-in-power may also 
decide to dip into their foreign accounts and bring back part of their 
holdings.
    
The government at the same time, must clearly understand that an exclusive 
concentration on the supply side of our economy resulting in huge 
exportable surpluses, a declining rate of inflation and a credible package 
of economic reforms are going to be our only saviours.
    
Simple appeals to loyalty patriotism and faith may produce some marginal, 
shot-term gratification (at the cost of increasing our banking systems 
foreign currency liabilities) but none of these are any substitute to real 
structural reforms and genuine balancing.

Actual disease
 
Instead of increasing our short to medium-term interest-bearing foreign 
liabilities, the concentration must be diverted to interest-free foreign 
equity investment (and the hurdles that foreign investors have experienced 
in the past). The new government must now concentrate on curing the actual 
disease rather than trying to find an aspirin for the cancer called 
structural economic flaws.
    
The government has now decided to send various high-powered delegations on 
a round-the-world tour to solicit funds. Even this is contrary to the 
accepted financial logic.
    
According to a recent study undertaken by The Economist, capital is far too 
intelligent in locating its own geographical boundaries for its most 
effective utilisation. The Economist further concludes that sending 
government officials to promote exports or to attract capital or to act as 
salespersons is nothing but a pure waste of national resources.
    
The cold-war era of surviving on concessional loans is long gone. We must 
wake up to the brave, new, competition-based world of commerce and that of 
economics. Capital is scarce, it has absolutely no loyalty, no preference 
based either on skin colour, creed, sex, religion or national origin It has 
no geographic boundaries and is increasingly being managed by professional 
asset managers.
    
Any sustained foreign inflow almost by definition, must be preceded by what 
the international market considers credible financial and economic reforms. 
As far as unadulterated financial theory and practice is concerned, any and 
all appeals to loyalty, patriotism and faith rightly belong to the economic 
dark ages.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 3: The State Bank of Pakistan has set up a monitoring cell 
to ensure proper recording and accounting of all receipts under the 
National Debt Retirement Programme.
    
An SBP press release said the cell would comprise four members including 
Deputy Governor Mr Mahfooz Alam and three other senior officials of the 
State Bank.
    
The members of the public are requested to please obtain proper receipts 
from the banks at the time of depositing the funds, the release said. It 
further said that the SBP had already advised the banks involved in the 
debt retirement programme to issue proper receipts in respect of donations 
and Qarz-e-Hasana bearing running serial number and date and authorised 
signature. According to the set of instructions issued to the banks, the 
receipts are required to be issued in duplicate. Permanent receipts should 
be issued and signed by a person other than the person who has issued 
interim/ temporary receipt at the time of receipt of donation/contribution 
at the counter. Preferably permanent receipt should be issued by the 
manager in charge of the branch jointly with another official.
    
The release said the banks have also been advised to ensure that the 
amounts deposited under debt retirement programme are duly accounted for 
and are subjected to proper internal checks. It said the SBP had set up 
inspection teams to check the accounts of and procedures employed to handle 
such deposits adding that strict action would be taken for any violation.
    
The release said if the members of the public desire to verify that the 
contributions made by them have been duly accounted for, they may approach 
the Monitoring Cell set up in the State Bank and give photo copy of the 
receipts for verification.

<a name="govt">Govt wants PIA to be cost-efficient</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, March 2: The new government has directed the management of 
Pakistan International Airlines to make it cost-efficient without any loss 
of time.
    
The directive has not demanded staff retrenchment, but neither does it 
advise the management otherwise. New recruitment, however, is to be made 
compulsorily on merit and no recommendations from any quarter are to be 
entertained in this respect.
    
The management has also been told to replace all five -year- old aircraft 
with new jumbos. The PIA at present has a total fleet of 47 aircraft, and 
all are more than five years old.
    
The service sector of the airlines is also expected to be given a fresh 
facelift by replacing over age stewards and stewardesses with more 
presentable and properly educated persons having the right aptitude and 
merit.
    
The kind of attention that is being paid to the PIA by the new government 
and the urgency with which changes are being demanded are said to be rather 
unusual. If things dont change within months for the better, the entire 
top management may be replaced with professional managers from the private 
sector, confided one insider. He also did not rule out the possibility of 
introduction of open -sky policy by the new government if the PIA showed no 
signs of improvement within a reasonable period of time. During his first 
tenure also, Nawaz Sharif had toyed with the idea of opening up Pakistan 
skies to foreign airlines.
    
The source was, however, not very certain why the new government was 
interested in replacing five-year- old aircraft with new jumbos at a time 
when the PIA was facing liquidity crunch. He categorically rejected the 
idea that middlemen looking for business for jumbos in Pakistan were 
actually behind this move.

<a name="then">The new economic strategy must not fail</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi

STAKES are high not merely for the new government of Mian Nawaz Sharif but 
for the Pakistan economy itself. Should his new economic strategy fail, the 
worst  a default in external payments, leading before too long to an 
economic collapse  will be unavoidable. In view of the stakes for the 
country, Mian Sahibs strategy must not fail. Would it succeed and what are 
its prerequisites?
    
Before an answer is attempted, it will be proper to pinpoint what the new 
strategy is. No doubt there are only a few pronouncements and the recently 
telecast speech of Mian Sahib to go by. These provide not even all the 
barebones. The highlights of it, however, are two: the first is the attempt 
to build up a cushion of foreign exchange reserves, made of contributions 
and loans from Pakistanis rather than from the international money market 
and the BWIs (Bretton Woods Institutions). Hopefully, that would prevent a 
default in the near future.
    
Meanwhile, the other prong of the strategy would come into operation, the 
substance of which comprises efforts to kick-start the economy. This would, 
if successful and in combination with the tax reforms, yield genuinely new 
resources to be mobilised with which to reduce the budget deficit. With 
that, excessive money creation would be curtailed and would have a good 
impact on the inflationary situation. However much of it is feasible within 
a short time-frame. Whether this strategy is an adequate response to the 
challenge of the situation is a legitimate question requiring an answer, 
more so because there is the wide open question of relationship with the 
BWIs.
    
It is easy to be sceptical and to pick holes but carping criticism in a 
situation of this kind, especially when so much is at stake, would be out 
of place and wholly unhelpful. Nevertheless it is necessary to temper the 
earnest desire with a realistic assessment of possibilities. Doubtless, 
Mian Sahibs strategy with regard to the building up of adequate foreign 
exchange reserves requires to be quantified  not with any exactitude but 
in an indicative manner so as to underline the magnitude of the efforts 
required and to enable observers to make an assessment of the 
possibilities.
    
It is also necessary to remember that this part of Mian Sahibs strategy is 
only a component part of the larger strategy of expeditiously reducing the 
debt servicing liability of the country, especially of the high interest-
bearing short term loans; this is to be done by early retirement of the 
high interest-bearing short-to-medium-term loans. What is the size of these 
particular kinds of loans? An indication was given by caretaker Shahid 
Javed Burki: he mentioned the figure of $10 billion.
    
The overall strategy then requires a foreign exchange reserve of the order 
of $10 to $11 billion. Let us also remember that the overall strategy 
includes contributions from privatisation funds; indeed an integral part of 
the idea is that all the proceeds of privatisation should go for the 
retirement of this kind of debt rather than being utilised as a budgetary 
support. This seems to be every reason to believe that Mian Sahibs 
strategy includes this idea. 
   
The requirement, therefore, is that over the next one to two years, the 
Pakistan government should be able to have this order of foreign exchange 
reserves so as to be able to rid the country of the crippling requirement 
of paying high sums in neat cash almost every month to service high 
interest bearing loans. By any assessment, it is a daunting task because of 
several factors.
    
One of it is: there are clear technical limits to what the Privatisation 
Fund can provide in the space of next two years; if the sales of the 
public-sector enterprises is to be orderly, and not a distress sale, 
realising $2 billion in the next two years should be rated as good 
performance. The brunt will have to be borne by the expatriate Pakistanis 
and locals with means to contribute in the qarz utaro, mulk sanwaro 
scheme. Here there is a big rider.
   
The rest of the world will not look kindly on the laundering of the black 
or drug money with no questions asked. Contributions will have to come from 
only genuine expatriates and businessmen. 
   
How that is to be achieved remains to be seen. Or they would be really have 
to be less punctilious about dirty money? That depends in part on our 
relationship with the BWIs. The earlier impression was that Mr. Nawaz 
Sharif was reconciled to the IMF scrapping the stand-by agreement and not 
disbursing any money under it. With that went the likelihood of IMF 
agreeing to another ESAF/EFF negotiations for quite sometime. the BWIs then 
would regard Pakistan as having walked out of their approved economic 
programmes. Latest indications are that the President and the caretakers 
were not merely bluffing or hoping hard. 
   
Mian Sahib and his experts appear to have discovered a middle road. They 
would remain loyal and bound to implement the targets laid down by the 
stand-by agreement, especially those that are denoted and determined by 
budget deficit coming down to 4 per cent by the end of the current year: 
the revised 1996-97 budget should not show any higher than 4 per cent 
budget deficit.
    
Mian Sahib would only renegotiate the means of achieving the goal in the 
space of the next four months. Instead of increasing user chargesthat he 
has frozen for the next four monthsand other increases in POL prices and 
the like, he would try to relate the economy without violating any of the 
other IMF conditionalities and he would meet the requirements of high 
resource mobilisation through more normal tax revenues, particularly by 
better realisation, a more extensive GST and increased production yielding 
more taxes and duties. 
   
This is to be juxtaposed with his assurances that he would not reduce 
defence spending or cut the nuclear programme or betray the Kashmiris. That 
translates into all the all commitments of the Pakistan government, the 
same as Benazir Bhutto was committed to.
    
Given these outside limitations, particularly the commitment to meet the 
target of 4 per cent of budget reduction by June 30 next, the denouement 
become more dicey. As it happens economic performance during the current 
year has been dismal from the point of view of both revenue collection as 
well as the governments borrowing requirements.
    
Reports are that Islamabad has already borrowed all the money that was 
admissible for the whole year and there are still five months to go. The 
exports too have not risencertainly not in terms of dollars. Revenue 
collections are down by a large margin. The freezing of the user charges, 
POL prices, institution of new subsidies and relief measures to the 
government employees and wage earners will make the budgetary situation 
even more difficult. If anyone expects the budget deficit to come down to 4 
per cent, he is living in a world of make-believe. 
   
The IMF is unlikely to accept five percent or more in deficit.
    
There is no doubt that Mian Sahibs basic strategy is sound, if partial. 
His is the proper way to raise resources. No doubt it is contingent on the 
economy picking up. For that he has to take deflationary measures. These 
include stabilisation of rupee value and lower interest rates. It is 
doubtful if the BWIs will accept these. Moreover, whether we pay attention 
to BWIs or not, the strategy anyway requires a certain amount of time to 
work; the turning around of the economy will anyhow take at least six to 
eight months at the fastest possible speed  provided all the required 
policies can be put in place now.
    
That is also the way to increase exports. But the joker in the pack would 
be, as the BWIs will loudly point out, inflation; it would rise. How much 
would it rise and how soon can it be controlled through increased 
production and more imports? It is a question of fine judgment and also of 
economic leadership. 
   
Theoretically, it is possible to plan two- or three-point increases in the 
cost of living to be brought down within the time-frame of four to six 
months. Fighting inflation is a longer-term job that requires sustained 
high growth rates over a period of time together with enlightened income 
distribution policies.
    
The more likely outcome, however, is that the IMF is unlikely to buy the 
earnest pleas of Messrs. Sharif and Aziz. They would cut Pakistan off to a 
shilling because they would not let Pakistan run higher budget deficits any 
more. The Islamabad mandarins are being less than honest. They are not 
talking about what the BWIs are really insisting upon. 
   
What the BWIs real demand is not too obscure: they want Islamabad to 
ruthlessly cut expenditures including the holy cows of debt servicing and 
defence. Should Islamabad be ready to do that in any substantial manner, 
they would be willing to consider rescheduling the debt servicing burden of 
the main long-term debts, while leaving Pakistan to cope with short-term 
debts as best as it can.
    
Indeed they would be happy to accommodate Mian Nawaz Sharifs strategy 
provided he goes all the way and also looks at the other side of the 
budgetary picture: he should be as ruthless in cutting down expenditures as 
he is earnest about retiring the short-term debts. Indeed without combining 
this expenditure-cutting part to his economic strategy, it is unlikely to 
succeed in any significant sense. The kind of mandate he has received 
requires him to provide leadership to the countrys economy, including 
changing the structures of the budget. 
   
This is a historic moment. He can do so now. If he fails, much else will 
fail.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 5: Stocks shrugged off the last few sessions weakness as 
investors covered positions at the lower levels on the blue chip counters.
    
The KSE 100-share index opened 34 points higher. But as follow-up support 
turned shy the index kept falling, finally finishing around 1.336.54 as 
compared to 1,617.17 a day earlier, showing gain of 19.37 points.
    
Leading textile shares, notably Lafayette Industries, Nishat Mills and 
Mehmood Textiles remained in strong demand and finished with an extended 
gain on news of good dividend by some other prominent companies.
 
Among the bank shares which recovered, Al-Faysal Bank, Askari Bank, Bankers 
Equity, Bank of Punjab, Crescent Bank and MCB were leading and so did EFU 
and Adamjee Insurance in the insurance sector. Adamjee recovered Rs 5. The 
recovery in the energy shares were led by PSO, Shell Pakistan and some 
others and so  did Atlas Honda and Ghandhara in the auto sector. Engro 
Chemicals and Fauji Fertiliser, which suffered heavy pruning during the 
last one week, recovered by Rs 6 and Rs 3 but Reckitt and Colman fell 
further on renewed selling.
    
Trading volume rose to 57.059 million shares from the previous 40 million 
shares, thanks to active alternate bouts of buying and selling in Hub-Power 
and PTC vouchers.
 
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, lower 30 paisa on 15.891m 
shares, followed by PTC vouchers, easy 45 paisa on 11.025m, ICI Pakistan, 
unchanged on 10.080m, Dewan Salman, lower 10 paisa on 6.878m, and Fauji

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

CONFUCIUS said: What goes up, must come down. However, most of our men who 
get to the top make a valiant effort to prove the wise old sage wrong.
    
Governor-General Mohammad Ali Jinnah (August 1947-September 1948), 
gentleman, our sole statesman, died in office and was buried with the 
honours due to him. The nation mourned.
    
Governor-General Khwaja Nazimuddin (September 1948-October 1951), last of 
the gentlemen-sportsmen. When Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan was 
assassinated, it was put to him that he would be the best man for the prime 
ministership. He agreed to step down, allowing wily Finance Minister Ghulam 
Mohammed to become governor-general.
    
Governor-General Ghulam Mohammed (October 1951-August 1955), a sick, tired 
man. On Liaquats death the survivors (the conspirators) wanting him out of 
the way agreed to put him out to pasture by kicking him upstairs. Initially 
he proved to be less sick than was thought, more assertive and more 
obstreperous than was anticipated. Latterly, when almost completely 
paralyzed, it was suggested that he resign. He declined. Eventually he was 
deposed by the powerful bureaucrats led by Iskander Mirza who carried him 
out of the GGs house, a dying man.
    
Governor-General Major-General Iskander Mirza (August 1955  March 1956), 
of the Indian Political Service, rose swiftly after partition, becoming 
defence secretary and then the trouble-shooting governor of East Pakistan. 
When the Dominion of Pakistan became a Republic in March 1956, he became 
the first President of Pakistan (March 1956-October 1958). On October 7, 
1958, he promulgated martial law, appointing as minister of defence his 
good friend Commander-in-Chief of the Pakistan Army, General Ayub Khan. 
Within twenty days he was deposed by Ayub Khan, supported by his three 
Lieutenants-Generals, Azam, Sheikh and Burki. he was bundled out of the 
Presidents House to Ziarat and then out of the country to London, where he 
died in exile.
    
President General Mohammed Ayub Khan (October 1958-March 1969). In 1965, 
his ministers led him to war against India and made him lose it. He never 
recovered. Ill-health and the antics of his sons compounded matters, 
discontent against him was engineered. A sugar shortage caused the people 
to riot, crisis followed crisis. Weakened by sickness, he was forced to 
step down and hand over the country to his army chief, Yahya Khan. He went 
home to farm his land in Haripur and later moved to Islamabad. When he 
died, largely forgotten by the public, he was buried with full military 
honours.
    
President General Agha Mohammed Yahya Khan (March 1969-December 1971). His 
and Pakistans friends made him lose a war and with it East Pakistan. He 
was deposed and one of the friends took over. He was held under house 
arrest until another general took over from the friend in 1977 and 
released him. He died three years later, tired and lonely.
    
President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (December 1971-August 1973), craving 
legitimacy, gave himself a constitution making the prime minister all-
powerful (anything signed by the president had to be countersigned by the 
prime minister to have any legal effect). He then proceeded to become prime 
minister, making puppet Fazal Elahi Chaudhry his president.
    
President Fazal Elahi Chaudhry (August 1973-September 1978). In July 1977, 
when Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was deposed by his hand-picked, 
bowing and scraping Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq, Fazal was 
allowed to stay on and complete his five-year term in office as president 
(Zia being chief martial law administrator). A forgotten man, none knowing 
whether he was alive or dead, he lived on in the presidency until quietly 
sent home.
    
President General Mohammed Zia-ul-Haq (September 1978-August 1988), would 
in all probability still have been with us as president had someone not 
blown him up, his fellow travellers, a crate of mangoes and his C-130 in 
the skies over Bahawalpur.
    
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan (August 1988-July 1993), as chairman of the 
Senate, constitutionally succeeded Zia. This former school teacher, 
patwari, member of the revenue service, of the audit and accounts service, 
was a stolid bureaucrat who became the first and last premier secretary-
general of the GOP, an austere finance minister, a strict Senate chairman.
    
The foundations of the opulent Aiwan-e-Sadar, designed at Ayub Khans 
bidding by Edward Stone, were laid during Ayubs regime. It was completed 
during Zias time, but the general chose not to move in, preferring to stay 
within hearing distance of his source of power, the army in Rawalpindi. The 
stern GIK was the first head of state to occupy the palace. Despite his 
personal frugality, his financial strictness, and his impeccable care for 
the states money, he managed to survive amidst pomp and glory until in 
1993 his friends prevailed upon him to commit a string of fatal mistakes 
and the generals asked him to go.
    
The workings of the mind of this last president were strange. He worked 
correctly up to 1990, when he had to dismiss the Benazir Bhutto government 
and install Nawaz Sharif and his men. He then put into effect Operation 
Cut Down the PPP and brought back into our politics, the faded, jaded, 
disgraced Jam Sadiq Ali as the cutting weapon. GIK knew full well that Jam 
was corrupt, undisciplined, unscrupulous, and capable of doing far more 
harm than good. From day one, Jam, as chief minister of Sindh, together 
with his hand-picked team, robbed and plundered this province.
    
Jams selected henchman for the job at hand (and other matters) was Imtiaz 
Shaikh of the defunct CSP. On Jams request, GIK willingly transferred him 
to the provincial service. He was promoted from Grade 18 straight to Grade 
20 and installed as Jams secretary, Imtiaz ruled the roost in Sindh 
according to his fancy. His mafia consisted of (amongst others) his 
cousin Ayub Shaikh, his brother Maqbool Shaikh, Imdad Ali Seehar, Khan 
Mohammed Mahar and Malik Asad Sikander. Each made his own pile, enriching 
himself at our expense, using the state apparatus and assets to extort 
money and to bully the people. Sindh, its funds and its land, were Imtiazs 
oyster.
    
Knowing his capacity, Jam brought Liaquat Jatoi on to his team as his 
finance minister. Jatoi spent discretionary funds entirely at Jams 
discretion and his own irresponsible whims. (One example: Secretary Salik 
Nazir asked for $10,000 to help educate his son abroad and Jam wrote Give 
 Kaun na baap ni Diwali?) Jatoi survived Jam, staying on as finance 
minister when Muzaffar Hussain Shah succeeded him. Can Liaquat Jatoi, whose 
own father, the good Hamid Jatoi, disapproves of his sons doings, be 
termed a reasonable man?
    
After the dismissal of Nawazs first government and the restoration of the 
PPP, Sindh Chief Minister Abdullah Shah and minister Pir Mazharul Haq 
decided to get Jatoi (and others of the Jam/Muzaffar coterie). An FIR 
(24/94) was filed in April 1994 in the Special Anti-Corruption Court in 
Karachi against Liaquat Jatoi. His Karachi house was raided, his family 
terrorised. Apprehending arrest, torture and the fabrication of a series of 
cases, Jatoi fled from Sindh and moved the Supreme Court in Islamabad for 
bail before arrest. Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah gave him temporary relief 
and bail was later confirmed by then strong, relief-giving Judge Mamoon 
Kazi of the Sindh High Court who courageously invoked the powers conferred 
by Section 561-A Cr.PC, the judgment emphasizing that they (the powers) 
are so large that the Court can pass any appropriate order to meet the 
ends of justice.
    
Thereafter, Liaquat Jatoi, with his ample savings, went into self-exile, 
hiding in Dubai until the second dismissal of Benazir Bhutto and her PPP 
government. Ironically, his pursuer Abdullah Shah is now absconding.  
Imtiaz Shaikh, on the other hand, who was dismissed from service by the PPP 
government, managed to hang on and face the music in Pakistan. He had 
enough money to settle matters out of court.
    
Now Liaquat Jatoi has been chosen by Nawaz Sharif to head the government in 
Sindh. Days before he was sworn in on February 20, the Shaikh mafia 
surrounded him. At the swearing-in Imtiaz adopted the role of his de facto 
secretary, his chief factotum, and made sure that everyone saw him doing 
so. Imtiaz has so far managed to have rescinded the dismissal order of the 
Sindh government (Dawn, Feb 27), but has yet to be cleared by the federal 
government.
    
The people of the impoverished and deeply indebted Sindh have apprised 
Nawaz Sharif of the impending peril.

<a name="anec">A necessary initiative</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi

PRIME MINISTER Mian Nawaz Sharif has broken the deadlock with India and 
wide-ranging negotiations may soon be resumed. This bold initiative needs 
to be welcomed. Obviously, the state of the economy has driven Mian Sahib 
to make the move. Islamabad is more or less broke; it cannot afford a 
hawkish foreign policy either vis-a-vis India or regarding Afghanistan. The 
position has been clear for sometime, though the governments had not 
acknowledged it.
    
World Bank emissaries like Shahid Javed Burki, Syed Shahid Husain et al 
were the first to speak the unvarnished truth, if also partially and to get 
rid of the PPP government. But their highlighting the grave balance of 
payments crisis was valid.
    
Talks with India over Kashmir and the other matters were inevitable. Our 
hawkish policy has hitherto comprised waiting for a chance to negotiate 
from a position of strength: in Kashmirs case it implied when the 
Kashmiris had harassed the Indian army enough to make New Delhi ready for a 
settlement acceptable to Pakistan; and in Afghanistan it meant waiting for 
the consolidation of the Taliban regime in Kabul. Unfortunately, the 
Indians have shown a remarkable insensitivity to the Kashmiri peoples 
human and other rights and have been ruthless enough to do what it takes to 
hold on.
    
Any further continuation of Pakistan-India deadlock simply means more 
misery for the Kashmiris without any visible light at the tunnels end. A 
change was anyhow needed, more so as the Kashmiris behaviour during and 
after the largely bogus election of last September was beginning to look 
disconcerting. As for Afghanistan, the prospect of Pakistans policy 
producing the desired goal looks increasingly unlikely: more warfare looks 
more likely and the consolidation of the Taliban regime may be an even 
longer-term prospect than was realised.
    
It is doubtful whether Pakistan can sustain the financial costs being 
incurred by pro-Pakistan elements  even after some foreign aid may flow 
in. In addition, there is the grievous loss of opportunities due to 
Pakistans original impatience and underestimation of the other elements of 
Afghan society besides the seven sisters. The time has, however, come for 
a change in Pakistans policy vis-a-vis Afghanistan and to lower the 
sights.
    
This necessity is stern and unavoidable; the economy is simply not in a 
position to sustain such a policy. We cannot go on borrowing any further. 
Look at what the caretakers have done. They borrowed a billion dollars just 
to manage things for three months, failing to build the monetary reserves 
at the promised level. Their legacy extends beyond the additional $ 1 
billion loans (at very high rates of interest) to substantially increasing 
the monthly debt servicing burden. It means, in the given conditions, 
Islamabad will require, for the next four months $ 1.85 billion for 
servicing the mainly short-term debts. Even with slightly better credit 
rating and with the goodwill of the IMF, these loans may simply not be 
available from known sources: international money market or multilateral 
agencies.
    
Mian Sahibs strategy of borrowing from Pakistanis is a desperate measure 
that is also a one-time or unrepeatable solution, rather a palliative. 
After all, it is borrowing and a very good chunk of the new money will 
require debt servicing at 9 to 10 per cent of interest. Borrowing is no 
solution, as the PM himself keeps on saying. Secondly, all his labours will 
prove to be like those of the mythical Sisyphus. Why? So long as Islamabad 
does not stop the haemorrhage of higher-than-available-resources 
expenditures, the size of the loans will continue to snowball. The 
situation was already intolerable by the middle of last year. Thus, a 
drastic change is unavoidable.
    
This should put the predictable opposition from Pakistans far right in 
perspective. It remains doubtful whether our famous establishment is ready 
to swallow what is logically implied in Mian Sahibs point of departure. 
The adversarial attitudes toward India have become so encrusted that these 
permit only a hard line. Reversing the policy or creating a tension-free 
atmosphere necessary for free trade, economic cooperation and for promoting 
regional trade and economic growth requires courage and will that our 
backwoodsmen do not seem to possess. But this is the only alternative that 
befits Pakistans circumstances. It implies a reduction of incomes of 
important people  the true vested interests. 
   
The latters emotions and selfishness would stand in the way of Mian Sahib 
going ahead at the required speed. The assumption here is that Mian Sahib 
cannot afford to lose. A question arises and the opposition will emphasise 
it: Does the prime minister has a chance in view of what the Indians are 
likely to say and do over the core issues?
    
Before discussing the point, let us be clear about the core issues. What 
our right-wing politicians imply is just the question of Kashmir; all the 
rest are negotiable and it is assumed that we will do what the Indians have 
been asking us to do provided they give us satisfaction on Kashmir. These 
include free trade, cultural exchanges, economic cooperation, regional 
economic integration and so forth. This is a partial assessment, however. 
One ventures to suggest that there is another and even harder question: it 
is the nuclear and missile programmes of the two countries.
    
As a consequence of the advanced stage of development or national or actual 
deployment of weapons of mass destruction  which is what the term 
deterrent implies  the 1.4 billion souls in the subcontinent are now at 
risk. Although it is only the Pakistanis and the Indians who are directly 
involved, the danger to others security via the environment  through 
wind, rain and water currents  will persist so long as these weapons 
remain in the inventory, assembled or as components.
    
The Indians are not in a reasonable frame of mind; their dreams of grandeur 
as a great power require a non-stop military build-up. There happens to be 
consensus in India over attaining the military sinews, including a sizeable 
nuclear stockpile, of a first-rank power. Even the Indian left is not 
clear-cut on this question; it seems to subscribe to the wishes of the 
majority of the Indian political class. That is a stumbling block. There is 
a lot of work to do by those who disapprove of nuclear weapons, missiles 
and militarisation in both India and Pakistan.
    
One mentions these difficulties so as to keep a balanced prospective. The 
Indians are not about to meet key Pakistani wishes  on demand. It is hard 
to imagine a politically vulnerable Deve Gowda government to agree to 
either a plebiscite or a settlement that would transfer sovereignty over 
the Kashmir Valley to Pakistan. It is hard to imagine any Indian government 
doing that in the near future, even one presided over by Jyoti Basu. 
similarly, the nuclear spectre is likely to go on haunting us for a long 
time. No doubt, something can be done on both questions in the immediate to 
medium-term future, provided there are alternative visions available in 
both countries.
    
Which is where intellectuals come in. But this is not a prescriptive piece; 
there will be time enough to discuss the merits and the possible lines of 
approach to the solution of the core issues in question. What requires to 
be emphasised here is that the PML government should move, as part a 
bilateral process, towards defusing the situation, allowing an increasing 
measure of normalisation, permitting free exchanges between bureaucracies 
as well as intellectuals to evolve the necessary approaches, measures and 
solutions to sort out these problems.

<a name="anew">A new era or flash in the pan?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Eqbal Ahmad

MR Nawaz Sharif inaugurated his prime ministerial term as no other 
Pakistani leader had done. He spoke artlessly, with apparent courage and 
conviction, leaving himself and his government no escape from the bold 
mission he has outlined. I have not before witnessed in Pakistan so 
meaningful a linking of power with purpose. 
   
He is promising to start a new epoch in our history. If he fails the price 
of failure shall be enormous indeed  for him and for the country.
    
The television staging was notable for its lack of fanfare and absence of 
artifice  a simple desk, an ordinary chair, and on the austere wall to his 
right an unadorned, stark portrait of Mohammed Ali Jinnah. The prime 
minister looked tired, shuffled uncomfortably, and occasionally halted 
while reading his speech slowly without a tele-prompter. As he turned them 
one by one you could literally count the pages, and watch the stack before 
him diminish. The austere setting was a piece of the whole. The medium 
merged with the message. If planned, it suggests that he is aided by a 
talented media manager. If unplanned, there was an excellent instinct at 
work.
    
The message was richer in symbolism than substance. But it will be an error 
to underestimate the importance of symbols in a society in transition. They 
help draw the outlines of an emerging political culture, shape official 
style and outlook, and inform public expectations. The Press and people had 
been railing the last five years against the worsening manifestations of 
VIPism which is rooted three-fold  in feudal outlook, colonial style, and 
the separation between state and society which augmented in the post-
colonial decades. The caretaker government of Malik Meraj Khalid responded 
to public disapprobation by closing the VIP lounges, and setting a 
commendable example of official modesty. Now an elected prime minister has 
furthered this process.
    
High officials and ministers shall be supplied only one car each, hopefully 
a modest one. They shall not bear special licence plates nor fly flags on 
their vehicles. Armed guards shall not line their route, and there will be 
no more of those traffic stopping VVIP movements: There will be no pomp 
and show in the name of security of Prime Minister, Governors, and Chief 
Ministers. Mr Sharifs reasoning for these limitations add substance to 
symbol: To obey the law is a human and social obligation. No one has the 
right to deviate from that responsibility by putting insignia of MNA, 
MPA... etc. No more plot allotments as perquisites of power and patronage. 
Not even official guards at the residences of ministers, advisors, and 
senior officials. Again the stated principle is crucial: Every citizen is 
equal before the eyes of the government and has equal right to receive 
protection. These are bold measures that strike at the roots of an elite 
culture of inequality. If they are followed and enshrined in law  and we 
must expect that they will be  then something extraordinarily positive 
will have happened in this country.
    
The Prime Minister announced other measures which suggest his 
transformation into a radical reformist. The shifting of holiday from 
Friday to Sunday was essential. The private sector will adjust and do well 
by it. There is a risk, nevertheless, of state employees transforming it 
into 3-days of vacation. Mian Sahib has cited Surat-ul-Juma to justify the 
change, so let the Jamaat- Islami holler. It is equally courageous of the 
PM to end the allocation of development funds to provincial and national 
legislators. He has withdrawn the largest single pork barrel from his own 
party colleagues. The raise of Rs 300 per month for all government 
employees of grade 1-16 is a mixed blessing. It is an inflationary measure 
that runs counter to his own pledge of reducing state spending. But it 
suggests a commitment to distributive justice, a commendable concern for 
the states low income employees, and a proclivity to disregard IMF and 
World Bank conditionalities when it is deemed in the national interest. A 
country as vulnerable as Pakistan today would have to tread cautiously. 
Yet, it is important to sustain these commitments beyond the flush of his 
unusual victory. If he can negotiate successfully between the vision and 
reality, Pakistan will be a better country.
    
What would normally be a stirring campaign speech the prime minister has 
delivered instead on assuming office, allowing himself no exit whatsoever. 
His promises, which ranged far and wide, were delivered within the 
framework of a bitter critique of state and society: Our country has been 
ruthlessly robbed for half a century. Enormous amounts of money were 
borrowed blindly and squandered on personal luxuries... I wonder where the 
30 billion dollars, which have mortgaged the future of every Pakistani 
child, has been spent... The railway system is obsolete. No motor way has 
been constructed; no employment opportunities created... They mortgaged the 
national interest to such an extent that we are not free to make our own 
budget... Our donors order us around. They pressure us to increase the 
electricity rates on an already poverty stricken people. We are told to 
increase price of flour which amounts to snatching the bread from peoples 
mouth. Yet we are forced to follow... Our own rulers have plundered us in 
ways that even the enemy would not practise in occupied lands... What sort 
of freedom is this? It is time for us to stand upon the ruins of the last 
fifty years and pledge that we shall take back our freedom. These are 
radical words heard often in communities of conscience and discontent but 
never in the Pakistani halls of power.
    
Nawaz Sharif read out the address in Urdu, with obvious emotion, coming 
close occasionally to tears. The chattering classes generally shrugged 
cynically as though they had known it all. But ordinary folks saw and heard 
him differently and, if newspaper accounts and my conversations through the 
bazaars are an indication, they have joined in making the pledge to take 
back our freedom. Mr Hamid, a Rawalpindi vendor, is an example. He got 
together with a dozen friends who have committed Rs 500 each toward 
breaking the begging bowl. This afternoon he shed tears of pride; eight 
of the twelve had made good on their commitment. In effect, Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif has offered a social contract, and citizens are signing up. 
Therein lies the promise of his government and also its great peril. If he 
fulfils even a quarter of his contract, history will have been made. If he 
does not, the flash in the pan may ignite a terrible fire.
    
The list of his promises is long and generally thoughtful. He will cut down 
government spending, rid the country of foreign debts, banish corruption 
and extravagance in government, restore the health of agriculture, augment 
the rate of industrialisation and investment, reconstruct the railways, 
build motorways and link roads, enact progressive labour laws, protect 
minorities and women, provide health facilities to poor and middle class 
families, create housing for the homeless, furnish primary education to 
all, create centres of excellence in higher education, establish 
participatory structures of accountability and governance, and more.
    
There is nothing excessive about these promises, and not much is new 
either. Their importance lies in that the countrys chief executive has 
made them as his inaugural pledge. Great voids have been left, 
nevertheless, in the making. His promises are not capable of fulfilment 
without structural reforms  in the relationship of land and labour, city 
and country, state and society, law and contemporary realities  and 
without the willed mutation of obsolete social, economic and administrative 
institutions. Reform, and even revolution, can be quiet and relatively 
peaceful. But they do require fundamental shifts in inherited 
configurations of power and wealth. On these fundamental questions the 
prime minister remained silent. He identified the destination to which he 
wants to take the country. He did not give the road map, not to mention the 
milestones.
    
I should urge Mian Sahib to reflect on his own words: I have to move 
forward breaking through all traditions that impede progress, this is the 
purpose for which you have given me your mandate. Neither is this mandate 
traditional nor would I be a traditional Prime Minister. traditions are 
embedded in structures of state and society, of power and property, ideas 
and institutions. So tell us where the impediments to progress are, and 
how, when do you propose to remove them. If your government does not do 
that it will administer, at best, some first aid, covering this wounded 
country with a lot of band aids.

<a name="idea">Idea of World Cup Test cricket gaining ground</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

With the proliferation of one-day cricket and its popularity worldwide in 
the last decade, the idea of a World Cup of Test cricket is fast gaining 
momentum. In fact it is on the agenda of the next ICC meeting in July to be 
held at Lords. It was supposed to be discussed in the 1995 and 1996 
meeting as well after Mathew Engel floated the idea in the 1995 Wisden 
Almanack, but had to be shelved.
    
What makes the cricket officials rethink about the whole concept is a fast 
growing disenchantment amongst the players because of the number of matches 
and competitions in which they have to commit themselves.
    
The Australian Players Association led by Tim May has already presented a 
paper to their cricket board expressing their concerns about commitments 
that the players have to make to be busy all the year round playing one-day 
cricket more than Test cricket.
    
The whole idea of a World Cup of Test is to help preserve the traditional 
form of the game, five-day Test cricket, for the 21st century, says Mathew 
Engel.
    
Engels idea is that all Test series from one match to a six game series 
would count the same with winner gaining two points, the loser none and one 
point each for a drawn series played over several years. His idea does not 
include any playoffs as suggested by former Australian captain Ian 
Chappell.
    
Chappells idea is that for points table to run over a four year cycle, 
alternating with the one-day World Cup, with one match of a series 
designated as the one to count on the championship points. At the end of 
the cycle, the top four teams would play off in semi-finals and the winners 
in a final to be played on neutral ground. Chappell considers that the 
final could be a big attraction for television marketing.  Another 
Australian Ross Edwards has his own plans. His idea entails the big six 
Test playing nations playing an equal number of home-and away Tests against 
each other over several years with the team gaining the maximum wins being 
declared the champion. Very similar to Engels idea. But what about the 
rest of the weaker playing nations. It surely would create disparity.
    
Another idea by John King, a cricket enthusiast takes account of many 
variables such as relative merits of home and away wins as well as quality 
of opposition.
    
Dr Ali Bacher, the managing director of the United Cricket Board of South 
Africa, has already announced his support and endorsed Engels plan. Majid 
Khan and Tim Lamb of the newly formed England and Wales Cricket Board at 
Lords also have aired their views in this regard and Bacher is sure that 
he will raise the issue at the ICC meeting.
    
Courtney Walsh, Wasim Akram are as much enthusiastic about it and have said 
so recently in Australia that they like the idea as has Clive LLoyd who 
said that he liked the concept of a competition to find out to determine 
the worlds best Test team.
    
Greg Chappell, the former Australian supremo as a batsman and captain has 
his own views about it.
    
Do we need it, and who stands to gain from such a system. Unless the ICC 
takes control of the programming and that wont happen, I see too many 
problems with this. It will be good for marketing and that is probably the 
main argument for it. The players are bubbling with revolt about the one-
day cricket, they are being asked to play. There has to be a lot of thought 
given to programming and in that regard players are as badly considered now 
as they ever have been. I suppose a two year cycle leading to the top four 
teams playing off in a sort of World Cup type tournament as Clive Lloyd has 
suggested might be the beat idea but it would be difficult to organise. 
Chappell had said.
    
Ian chappell who was the first in 1991 to air his views about a 
championship of Tests says. We have a world cup holder in the limited over 
version, why not a world champion of Test cricket? The thought of playing 
off for world championship should excite any self-respecting Test 
cricketer. If it doesnt, Test matches are doomed to die the death of the 
dismal draw, he says.
    
Richie Benaud, the doyen of the game thinks otherwise. It seem to me that 
people are pushing their own ideas in the hope the administrators will 
choose their system. I am happy with computers rankings for players. They 
are good hotel bar discussion topics and perhaps that it what the Test 
championship ideas should be. I am happy with the state of Test cricket, 
he says.
    
Obviously there will be contrasting ideas in favour or against. When 
Pakistan, Australia, South Africa and West Indies now play at Test level 
the series of matches are tagged as world battle of Tests. To be frank all 
permutations are nothing more than hypothetical calculations. A 
championship would obviously set peoples minds at rest at least for four 
years once the idea is put into practice or else the cricketing world will 
never know the real merits of a Test team.

<a name="juni">Pakistan juniors keep squash hopes alive</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

The Pakistani juniors re-affirmed their total dominance in the realm of 
squash regaining the team title as well as retaining the individual trophy 
of the eighth Asian Juniors (under-19) Squash Championship in Madras 
(India) last week.
    
Now as this years Runners-up, Pakistan had re-captured the team title with 
a 21 victory over the defending champions Malaysia in the eight-nation 
contest. The young rising squash star Mansoor Zaman, the new Asian 
champion, and experienced Kashif Shuja won their matches 1-1 in straight 
games. Team captain Amjad Khan, however, suffered defeat against Malaysias 
Beg Hee by 23 in the second match lasting one hour seven minutes.
    
Mansoor Zaman - who in his first appearance in the Asian juniors 
championship won the individual title by defeating Kashif Shuja in the all-
Pakistan final, virtually destroyed Mohammad Azlan Askander of Malaysia in 
the opening match in straight games. The defeat of Amjad Khan, the nephew 
of world champion Jansher Khan, brought Pakistan under considerable 
psychological pressure.
    
Kashif Shuja, the Asian Junior runner up, carrying rich experience of last 
two World Juniors championships, ensured the teams success by overcoming 
Michael Soo in straight games. Thus Pakistan won back the trophy.
    
Mansoor Zaman possesses great potential and seems destined to make his 
impact on international circuit with a more professional touch and through 
hard training. His early stroke-making needs discipline. Also strengthening 
of stamina should also be one of his main goals. 
   
Pakistan can hopefully look towards youthful Mansoor Zaman to bring glory 
and honour for Pakistan at the higher level. Winning of the Asian juniors 
title is a fine achievement and would certainly give a great morale boost 
to Mansoor. But one should not forget that before Mansoor, Umer Hayat 
(1983), Jansher Khan (1985 and 1987), Abdul Rashid (1989 and 1991) and 
Amjad Khan (1995) had been the Asian Juniors champion. But only Jansher 
Khan, through his innate skill and strenuous training, has reached the 
pinnacle of glory.
    
So the secret at the higher level success lies in total commitment to the 
game. Mansoor Zaman or any other youngster aiming for high achievements 
must prepare for hard training and sustained effort. The present young 
generation of squash players carries heavy responsibility but is bettered 
placed and looked after in terms of incentives and financial support.
    
The PSF President Air Chief Marshal Mohammad Abbas Khattak, Senior Vice-
President Air Marshal Aliuddin and Secretary Sq-leader S.M, Fazal have 
shown due keenness for execution of proper coaching schemes and training of 
the probable at Peshawar before the four-member team of Amjad Khan, Mansoor 
Zaman, Kashif Shuja and Ejaz Azmat was finally selected. The performance of 
Ejaz Azmat, who also represented Pakistan in the 1996 Cairo World Juniors 
Championship, remained unsatisfactory.
    
A panel of coaches including Jansher Khan, national coach Mohibullah Khan, 
who was team coach at Madras, and Omar Zaman, who supervised the six-week 
Peshawar camp, also contributed towards Pakistan teams success at Asian 
Juniors squash.
    
Now our target must be to win the next years world juniors championship. 
The PSF should start the process of building a winning combination for re-
capturing the individual and team titles. Except Mansoor Zaman both Kashif 
and Amjad would be overage next year for the 1998 world juniors 
championship, scheduled in Princeton, New Jersey (USA), in August.

Sept 20-30, will commence immediately after the 26th National Games at 
Karachi, the decision was taken at Pakistan Sports Board during a meeting 
between the officials of the board and Pakistan Olympic Association.

two years of training period in preparation for the 2nd Islamic Womens 
Games in October this year. However,  the  commencement of training camp, 
 and  its participation in the biannual games would be officially approved 
by the Executive Committee of Pakistan Sports Board. The year overdue EC 
meeting is now being called within a fortnight, it was learnt. The EC 
meeting will give final approval to these issues of immediate concern.

<a name="davi">Davis Cup loss against Iran a disturbing development</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

THE first round loss of Pakistan in the Asia-Oceania Group two of the Davis 
Cup against Iran must have caused concern to the lovers of tennis in the 
country. The defeat was specially sad since the host nation, which was 
Pakistan, had given its option for the surface and the players were backed 
up by the fans in Islamabad.
    
It has still not been fully explained why Pakistan decided to play on the 
rather slow-paced courts of clay, which is day by day being discarded by 
the tennis comity of nations. Certainly many may point to the Roland Garros 
of Paris where the French Open grand slam is an annual feature. But the 
French are traditionalists and they can hardly follow the Englishmen where 
Wimbledon is being played on the turf of the All-England Club. Australia, 
no doubt, has replaced the grass of Kooyong in the centre of Melbourne with 
a rubbered surface, which gives considerable aid to the serve-and-volley 
racket- wielders and it is a pleasure to watch the whirligig of pendulum 
swaying to and fro in the later round matches, if not the initial ones.
    
America too has chosen the cemented courts for their grand slam and has 
switched from the grass of the Forest Hills in New York to the Flushing 
Meadows. One expected the Pakistan Tennis Federation to either have staged 
the matches in Lahore on the grass courts, or the hard surface of Karachi, 
where the spectators would have packed the galleries in large numbers to 
cheer and laud the contestants which may have given the necessary boost to 
the game. The days of slow strokes and baseline tactics are gone and the 
federation should have encouraged the players with booming first service, 
sharp ground strokes and powerful overheads. Defeat and victory are part of 
the game but the national set-up has to look to the future, never mind the 
hard work and the effort needed to produce the modern players.
    
The Davis Cup stumble in the first round of what was previously the Eastern 
Zone shows how the country has gone down the hill in tennis and we are 
joining the category of the midgets of the game. While there are numberless 
youngsters strutting around the courts of the sporting centres the game of 
the seniors is declining in level, for inexplicable reasons. Anyway the 3-2 
thrashing given by Iran was too bad to be true.
    
Iran, as one scans through the score-sheet of the global competitions, has 
a closed-door policy and hardly belongs to the higher echelon of world 
tennis, though in their country they recently brushed aside the foreign 
challenge and took the honours of the Satellite competition. It is quite 
clear that their drill and on-court training are more strenuous than many 
regional countries and sooner than later the ratings of their racket-
wielders may be upgraded in the calculus of International Tennis 
Federation.
    
As one finds from the matches in Islamabad once the Iranians had their 
noses in front in the doubles it was not difficult for the visitors to take 
one reverse singles to advance to the next round of the Davis Cup, in which 
they are hoping to qualify for the World Group.
    
Many experts and veterans are questioning the policy of the federation to 
persevere with the veteran Hameedul Haq. One expected a youngster to have 
been fielded once Irans Ramin Raziani had demolished Pakistans Umer 
Rasheed with his aces and powerful volleys in the first reverse duel. The 
youngster, Shafiq or Shirazi, may have gained in experience and match 
sense, even if the players may have lost and Irans margin of victory may 
have enlarged.
    
Umers easy capitulation to Irans Mansour Bahrami and Ramin Raziani was 
surprising, though sorrowful for Pakistan. In the matches he seemed 
tentative and off-colour. It may perhaps be due to the slow surface. The 
fans expected him to forge ahead in the two ties after he had worked hard 
to take one set. However, it appears that he was under-prepared and the 
challenge turned out to be a tall order for him. Lacking were his 
athleticism on the court, his quick anticipation and his bullet-like 
volleys. Umers sharp first service was misfiring and there were more 
inhibitions in his shots. This was too bad for the player and sad for the 
country. He had been a confident stroke-maker in home tournaments with 
plenty of zest and match-winning rhythm.
    
Hameedul Haq set a record of 41 Davis Cup appearances and won his two 
singles matches on a surface that suits his game, with a determination and 
enthusiasm that was laudable for a player of his age. Though he wants to 
give up competitive tennis the federation is still pressing him to help the 
country in the play-off against Singapore in the coming April. A defeat 
would drive them into the insignificant Group III of Asia-Oceania Zone.
    
The Secretary of the Federation was so upset over the tennis drubbing given 
by Iran that he tendered his resignation, which has not yet been accepted 
by the President and later the Council may have to deliberate on it. 
However, a new calendar will have to be chalked out to raise the number of 
tournaments, more on hard surface and less on clay. The training and 
coaching have to be a continuing process. The youngsters like Aisamul Haq, 
Aqeel Khan, Ijaz Ahmad, Nomi Qamar are fine bets for future. They are 
diligent stroke-makers with variety and imagination. Certainly like India, 
centres of coaching have to be set up and the litmus test of the 
youngsters progress should be competitions the year-round.

<a name="open">Pakistan open squash in Islamabad: Aliuddin</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A.Majid Khan

KARACHI March 3: Air Marshal Aliuddin, Senior Vice President of the 
Pakistan Squash Federation, disclosed that Golden Jubilee Pakistan Open, a 
super series event, would be staged in August at the newly-constructed PSB 
Squash Complex in Islamabad.
    
Talking to Dawn the Air Marshal, said the other day PSF has now decided to 
hold the Pakistan event, which is part of the Pakistan Golden jubilee 
celebrations, in Islamabads new complex some time in August for which a 
date would be announced in the near future.
    
The PSF has planned to get the Championship Court of the Sports Board 
complex air-conditioned by seeking the sponsorship for one of the major 
events of the world, he said adding the prize money would be over US 
dollars 60,000.
    
The Squash complex was built over four years ago but it remained un-
utilised because it has no centralised air-conditioning as it involves over 
Rs one crore.
    
Air Marshal Aliuddin said the PSF is in touch with PSB authorities about 
getting the championship court air-conditioned and said the federation 
would succeed in holding a major squash championship, the first ever, in 
the federal capital. Since it is a super series event almost all the top 24 
players, including Jansher Khan, the champion of world squash, would be 
seen in action, he added.
    
However Karachi remains the backup venue for the Pakistan Open but he was 
sure that Islamabad would be the venue for the coming contest. The Senior 
Vice President further stated that Pakistan enjoys a unique record of 
producing many world renowned players and is a powerful force in the game 
but now we have planned to assume the role of major organisers of 
international squash events in the country. This year six international 
tournaments are planned to be held at different parts of the country and 
the prize money would be ranging from US dollars 7000 to 25,000, he said.
    
The first international tournament, he said, would be organised in April at 
Lahore by the Punjab Squash Association. A similar tournament is also 
planned for Karachi, hoping that the Sindh Squash Association, like the 
Punjab body, would secure sponsorship. The federation would certainly help 
SSA in holding an international event which could not be held last year, 
said the Air Marshal.
    
The international tournaments, emphasised the Air Marshal Aliuddin, would 
considerably help our players, particular the new entrants of the PSA 
circuit, to improve their international rankings. It is good for Pakistan 
squash.
