--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammed Riaz

KARACHI, Nov 2: The principal of Jamia Islamia, Binori Town, Maulana 
Dr Habibullah Mukhtar, and one of his colleagues were burnt to death 
when two motorcyclists hurled an explosive device at their van on 
the Business Recorder Road.
    
The driver also died on the spot as the assailants fired at the van.
   
Maulana Mukhtar (60) was a son-in-law of the late Maulana Mohammad 
Yousuf Binori.
    
A companion of the Maulana was injured and another escaped unhurt in 
the shooting, which took place near the Guru Mandir intersection at 
12.50pm.
    
Late in the night a student of Jamia Nomania was shot dead near 
Islamia College while he was going to Binori Town for attending the 
funeral of Maulana Mukhtar.
    
The others who died were identified as Mufti Abdus Sami (40), driver 
Mohammad Tahir (26), and student Ibrarul Haq (23). Maulana Bashir 
Ahmed Naqshbandi (45), received multiple bullet injuries. Maulana 
Abdul Qayyum Chitrali (46) escaped unhurt as he jumped off the van.
    
Protests spread to other areas of the city by evening and people 
started stoning vehicles. They also burned tyres to impede traffic.
    
Residents of localities on Khalid Bin Waleed, Shaheed-i-Millat and 
Jamshed Roads told Dawn about the forced closure of markets and 
shops in the neighbourhood. Police were not present, one resident 
complained.

<a name="stri">Strike paralyses Karachi</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 7: A complete strike was observed in the city on Friday 
on a call given by the Wafaqul Madaris Arabia, a chain of 
seminaries, and endorsed by politico-religious organisations, 
against the killings of two Ulema of Jamia Islamia, Binori Town, on 
Nov 2. 
    
Maulana Dr Habibullah Mukhtar, principal of the Jamia Islamia, 
Binori Town; Mufti Abdul Sami and van driver Mohammad Tahir were 
killed by unknown motorcyclists near Guru Mandir on Sunday.
    
The city was virtually taken over on Friday by the students of 
religious schools run by the Wafaqul Madaris, Jamia Binoria, and 
workers of both factions of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam; Swad-i-Azam 
Ahl-i-Sunnat, Sipah-i- Sahaba Pakistan and Harkatul Ansar.
    
The protesters set a wine shop (JBS Traders) on fire in Gulshan-i-
Iqbal and blocked the streets and roads by burning tyres and placing 
big stones there.
    
Students of Jamia Islamia, Clifton, pelted shops and offices in the 
Clifton Centre with stones and forced the shopkeepers to pull down 
shutters. "The rangers have asked us to immediately leave the area", 
a shopkeeper told Dawn by telephone.
    
The miscreants set ablaze a classroom of a school, a roadside hotel 
and some hawker stalls.
    
The furniture of a classroom of a government primary school was 
reduced to ashes in the neighbourhoods of Korangi. The police said 
the fire broke out due to short-circuit, but fire-brigade sources 
held a different view, saying the fire was apparently not caused by 
the short-circuit.
    
In Bilal Colony — a locality in the limits of the Korangi Industrial 
Area police — some miscreants burnt a roadside hotel when they found 
it open. They also set ablaze some stalls of hawkers near the hotel.
    
All business establishments, shopping centres and markets in the 
five districts remained closed. Transporters, who had observed a 
partial strike in the city on Wednesday, did not bring out buses, 
water tankers, trucks, coaches, vans, taxis and rickshaws on the 
roads.
    
The police and rangers remained off the roads and this gave the 
students an opportunity to freely vent their anger. An Edhi 
volunteer said miscreants had damaged an ambulance (EA-0941) near 
Hadi Mills in Old Golimar.

<a name="sena">Senate passes Environmental Protection Bill, 1997</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Yasin

ISLAMABAD, Nov 7: The Senate on Friday passed the Pakistan 
Environmental Protection Bill 1997 amidst unanimous cries of "Ayes, 
Ayes" from the treasury and the opposition benches.
    
As the Upper House took up legislative business, Deputy Opposition 
Leader Senator Raza Rabbani told the Chairman of Senate that his 
party was not opposing the Bill as it was originally his party which 
had introduced the Bill.
    
Consequently the Bill was passed with unanimity by the House in a 
couple of minutes when the Chairman, Mr Wasim Sajjad, moved the 
motion for taking the Bill into consideration and then for its 
adoption. The Bill had a smooth sailing all the way.
    
The Bill provides for the establishment of federal and provincial 
agencies, a framework for implementation of national conservation 
strategy, establishment of provincial sustainable development funds, 
the protection and conservation of species, habitats, and 
biodiversity, conservation of renewable resources, establishment of 
environmental tribunals and appointment of environmental 
magistrates, environmental impact assessment and promotion of public 
education and awareness of environmental issues through the mass 
media.
    
Under the Bill, in addition to official environment agencies, any 
person or organization can request for inquiries and investigation 
into environmental issues and/or award of compensation for 
losses/damages sustained in this regard. The Bill empowers the 
federal government to make rules for implementing important 
international environmental agreements to which Pakistan is a party.
    
The Bill provides that in case of offences by government, local 
authorities or local councils, head or other officer shall also be 
deemed guilty of such contravention along with the government 
agency, local authority or local council and shall be liable to be 
proceeded against.

<a name="areo">Aero Asia starts operations today</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shafaat Yar Khan

SHARJAH, Nov 5: Pakistan's largest private airline Aero Asia 
formally launches its operation on the Sharjah-Lahore sector with 
its first Boing 747 with more than 100 passengers arriving tomorrow 
(Thursday).
    
The introduction of the new private airline, is expected to break 
the monopoly of national flag carrier, Pakistan International 
Airlines in this sector.
    
Presently, PIA operates six weekly flight between Lahore and Dubai, 
which serves for passengers from Sharjah and other northern emirates 
also.
    
Airline authorities hoped that extra baggage allowance, competitive 
fares, convenient arrival and departure timings and will play a key 
role to attract more passengers from northern Emirates, particularly 
those looking for direct connection between Sharjah and Lahore.
    
'With 50 kgs of baggage allowance (the highest for any airline 
flying to Lahore) and competitive fares (15% cheaper than PIA), Aero 
Asia is targeting higher traffic on this sector,' says Rafique Nasir 
who finalized arrangements for the airline's new operation.
    
The airline has waived the fuel surcharge making the fare more 
competitive.
    
For domestic flights which started on May 6, 1993, the airline 
operates BAC-111s, but will use a Boeing 707 on the Sharjah-Lahore 
sector, with 16 business class and 142 economy class seats.
    
The airline plans to lease an Airbus A-300 in January 1998 for its 
new international routes.

<a name="stat">State Bank rings alarm bells after worst year</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

A COMBINATION of enhanced autonomy of the Central Bank, the fact 
that the government it impugns is no longer in office and the 
adverse consequences of the cumulative follies of successive 
governments in recent times, has made the State Bank of Pakistan 
come up with a forthright report on the performance of the economy 
in 1996-97.
    
Almost all the negative indices listed in the annual report confirm 
what have been known to the people through earlier official 
disclosures, but the report goes beyond last year and points out to 
the beginning of the sad chapter in our recent economic history, 
before declaring last year as one of the most difficult and 
disappointing year in the economic history of the country.
    
The report cautions that even if the targets for the current year 
are less ambitious or more realistic than last year. They may not be 
achieved without adequate exertion and true vigilance on the part of 
the government along with the right mix of fiscal and monetary 
policies.
    
But the Bank with its almost total autonomy has a new responsibility 
for monitoring the performance of the government and progress of the 
economy and bring them to the notice of the National Assembly and 
through it to the country.
    
It did well by coming up with the first quarterly report to the 
National Assembly, as enjoined by the new law on the enhanced role 
of the Central Bank, for the first quarter of this calender year on 
May 31 last, but did not follow that up with a second quarterly 
report for the second quarter.
    
Instead the present annual report for 1996-97 is to be treated as 
its second report which is not proper as it covers the whole year 
which encompasses three governments within the period and does not 
specifically evaluate the performance of the Nawaz Sharif government 
in its first full quarter ending June 30.
    
And now that the first quarter of the Nawaz government in the 
current financial year is over (on September 30) it should come up 
with its quarterly report soon. The National Assembly with the 
overwhelming majority support for the government may not be 
particularly interested in the next quarterly report, but the 
newspapers and the non-official economic community are.
    
The large gap between target and performance for the last five year 
shows that it is easy to fix attraction targets and difficult to 
achieve them in the normal bureaucratic manner.
    
And when economic growth goes down as low as 3.1 per cent against 
the target of 6.3 per cent in a country with a population growth of 
3 per cent per annum, almost everything goes out of gear and the 
country is left with a series of 14 negative indices and an increase 
in domestic and foreign debt which together has risen to Rs 2,240 
billion.
    
In fact, with external debt at Rs 1,198 billion, it is exceeding the 
domestic debt of Rs 1,042 billion by Rs 156 billion. And following 
the soaring short-term borrowing abroad the cost of that has risen 
to a high 11 per cent.
    
On short-term loans of $2,486 million, the interest payments due are 
$263 million. And that makes the IMF's loan of $935 million at half 
a per cent interest and even the External Fund Facility of $623 
million at around 4.5 per cent interest very valuable.
    
What the government has to realise is the heavy inter- dependence of 
the economic sectors. Economic growth fell to 3.1 per cent last year 
as agriculture growth inched up only 0.7 per cent against the 
targeted 5 per cent. That happened as the major crops, particularly 
wheat and cotton, recorded a negative growth 4.5 per cent. Minor 
cops increased by only 3.4 per cent against the target of 8.8 per 
cent.
    
All that resulted in the manufacturing sector growing by only 1.8 
per cent against the target of 7.2 per cent, while the crucial large 
scale manufacturing registered a negative growth of 1.4 per cent 
against the modest target of 6.5 per cent.
    
In the case of the large scale sector, the paralysis has been 
enduring as during the previous three years, the growth had been 
only 4.1, 1.7 and 2.6 per cent respectively and ultimately climaxed 
in the negative growth of last year. However all official figures 
show a constant growth of 8.4 per cent for the small scale sector 
and that is incredible.
    
As the industrial and agricultural sectors grossly under- performed, 
the service sector grew last year by 4.1 per cent against the target 
of 6.1 per cent and the 4.8 per cent of the previous two years. As a 
result of less of the exportable surplus being available from both, 
the commodity producing sectors, exports fell by 2.7 per cent 
against the target of a 14.4 per cent rise.
    
To boost exports, the rupee was devalued last year by over 13 per 
cent, including 3.65 per cent in September and 7.85 per cent in 
October last by the Benazir government and the rupee came down to Rs 
40.46 to a dollar by the end of the year from Rs 35.10 on June 30 
last year.
 
But that instead of helping the exports cut down the imports by five 
per cent as the imports became more costly, particularly after the 
duties went up to the extent of the devaluation. How much of such 
imports then came in through smuggling remain a matter for 
speculation.
    
But when the imports fell by 5 per cent instead of rising by 5.1 per 
cent as targeted the government's revenues fell and aggravated the 
budgetary deficit which rose of 6.2 per cent of the GDP instead of 
the targeted four per cent, which was the demand of the IMF.
    
As agricultural and industrial production fell and imports came to 
cost far more, inflation rose to 11.8 per cent officially, and far 
more actually, against the target of 8.5 per cent, and the previous 
year's 10.8 per cent.
    
Fall in incomes following the negative indices all round resulted in 
lowering the domestic liquidity to 12.2 per cent against the target 
of 13.1 per cent based on higher growth expectations, but the rise 
in domestic credit was a high 15.3 per cent against the targeted 
14.2 per cent because of excessive government borrowing to cover the 
budget deficit.
    
Low economic growth along with the shrinking of the industrial 
sector, as a consequence of which, about 4,000 industrial units 
falling sick, resulted in the tax revenue increasing by 13 per cent 
against the target of 14.9 per cent and the previous year's 14.1 per 
cent.
    
And while the growth of total tax revenues dwindled to 15.5 per cent 
against the targeted 18.5 per cent — a large gap of 3 per cent — and 
the budgetary deficit rose to 6.2 per cent against the targeted 4 
per cent.
    
The fall in per capita incomes by $20 to $470 lowered the growth of 
savings to a 11.8 per cent against the target of 14.7 per cent which 
is pretty low by Asian standards, including that of India. Hence 
interest at current prices rose by 18.2 per cent against the 
targeted 20.5 per cent which is again low by Asian standards.
    
The SBP report says: "Slowing down the industrial activity is also 
linked to a low rate of investment in the last several years. Gross 
fixed investment which recorded an average growth rate of 1.9 per 
cent (in real terms) in the last five years, actually declined by 
3.6 per cent last year and in particular significant negative growth 
was recorded in manufacturing and agriculture."
    
In the crucial balance of payments sector while the balance of trade 
recorded a deficit of $3,328 million, the balance of payments 
recorded a deficit of $4.2 billion and left the country with a poor 
foreign exchange reserve of $1,219 million against the target of 
$1,787 million and the previous year's $2,065 million, necessitating 
hectic short term borrowing at a high cost.
    
Having done so badly last year, the government has fixed a growth 
target of 6 per cent for the current year, something which has not 
been achieved for the last five years. 
   
It is yet hopeful of achieving a 5.1 per cent growth in agriculture 
which it expects will boost industrial production for which the 
target is the same as last year's 7.2 per cent.
    
But the government has to go all out to enlist and sustain the 
cooperation and energetic efforts of agriculturists and trade and 
industry to achieve such results in a year in which it cannot fail 
again. The SBP has to remain a vigilant monitor and timely bell-
ringer.

<a name="deva">Devaluation unlikely to boost exports</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
S.M.A. Rizvi

THE DEVALUATION of the rupee by 8.7 per cent against the US dollar 
is controversial not only among economists but the business 
community too. According to the Finance Minister, the step was taken 
by the State Bank, an autonomous body but not so autonomous as to 
recover loans from the defaulters. 
   
Instead of the Governor of the State Bank, the decision is being 
defended by the finance minister, the commerce minister, the 
chairman of the Planning Commission and others. 
   
The main argument in its favour is that it will boost exports and 
help achieve the target of $9.2 billion set for fiscal year 1997-98. 
Let us see how far this measure will help us enhance exports.
    
Major export items are yarn, fabrics, and textile made-ups, rice, 
carpets, leather, sports goods, surgical goods, fruits nd vegetable, 
etc. Let us study their export potential (All figures are based on 
government statistics released for the year June 1996 to July 1997).
    
Cotton: Textile industry is the backbone of Pakistan's exports 
having about 65.71 per cent share in the total volume. Since the 
last several years, the cotton crop is continuously suffering from 
pests, adulterated pesticides, due to bad manure, and shrinkage in 
acreage. 
   
The export of raw cotton will, no doubt, benefit from the 
devaluation but there is hardly any surplus. For about three decades 
the spinning mills exploited the growers by purchasing Phutti at a 
very low price. But for the last three or four years the situation 
has reversed. Now farmers demand a price of raw cotton which is at 
par with the intentional price or more. 
 
Though they are not benefited from it to the export of full 
increase. Major portion is shered by feudals lords, grinners and 
speculators who also have entered into this field. They hoard cotton 
with loans obtained through banks and demand high prices. It is a 
long story but to cut short, the country may not benefit from raw 
cotton export on account of nonavailability of surplus.
    
Cotton yarn at one time had fetched $1.6 billion but declined to $1 
or 1.2 billion. Last year it had picked up again to $1.3966 billion. 
   
The problem with yarn is, that it is an essential semi- manufactured 
raw material which is indispensable for all value- adding 
industries, which, although unorganized, fetch the highest amount of 
foreign exchange.
    
Inspite of numerous exercises and studies, the government and the 
private sector have not been able to determine correctly what the 
domestic requirements are and what export surplus is.
    
No doubt, devaluation will help boost to export of cotton yarn but 
at the cost of domestic value-added export industries. The value 
addition in cotton yarn itself is negligible.
   
Moreover it is a known fact that our fabrics, garments, knitwear, 
towels, bedsheets and similar products are ousted from the 
international market by textile goods manufactured abroad by our own 
cotton yarn, which is sold to them at prices which are cheaper than 
those in the local market. Even the APTMA which was vocal for 
devaluation has disagreed with the present drastic downward 
adjustment. They wanted it to be done gradually and not in one go. 
Shortage of yarn in the domestic market will result in the closure 
of small factories, causing not only unprecedented unemployment but 
also substantial losses in foreign exchange.
    
Value-added textiles: These will sufferer from devaluation more than 
others. The cost of production is already too high. The prices of 
raw materials, including yarn, have already gone up. 
   
The cost of machinery, spare parts, dyes, chemicals, packing 
materials etc. which are imported had already risen substantially 
and now there will be another hike on account of this devaluation. 
Even the local inputs i.e. cotton yarn, locally made chemicals and 
utility charges will further rise. Wages of labour will also 
increase following a new dose of price hike. 
   
The duty drawback rates have been slashed without any justification, 
knowing fully that the reduction in Customs tariff has been 
neutralised by the high prices of foreign imports consumed by the 
industry. While fixing duty drawback rates, no consideration is 
given to the refund of income tax paid by the importers at source, 
excise duty and other charges levied on electricity, telephone and 
gas. Wholesalers are not in the sales tax net. 
   
The exporter, therefore, cannot claim refund of sales tax on 
purchases made by them. Pakistan has, since the last six years, 
become a "buyers market".
    
Majority of export is made on deferred payment basis mostly on DA. 
Buyers dictate their own prices and terms. 
  
Apart from other factors, export prices are low on account of 
internal and external competition. If any devaluation or any other 
concession is given to the exporter, foreign buyers immediately 
react and start demanding reduction in prices by the same 
percentage. Sellers' resistance is almost nil. Why? 
   
Simply because of the inconsistency in the government policies and 
forbidding cost of finance, high prices of raw cotton and cotton 
yarn. If the government expects devaluation will earn more from the 
export of value-added goods, it may not materialise. This sector 
needs real incentives, and not just lip service.
    
Rice: Export of rice is not linked with any competition in 
international market. The Rice Export Corporation of Pakistan (RECP) 
and the private rice exporters are responsible for the low exports. 
Pakistan's Basmati rice is certainly superior to Indian variety. 
Inspite of every effort, no proper gradation and standard packing 
has ever been made. 
 
There are instances of many Indian businessmen abroad, having 
imported Pakistani Basmati, graded it, packed it attractively sold 
it at a very high price in the international market posing it as 
Indian rice. Rice did not require devaluation for its export, proper 
quality control, non- adulteration and acceptable packing could 
fetch us a billion dollars without devaluation. Rice export last 
year's fetched $460,300 million.
    
Carpets: The export of carpets is suffering from the unjustified 
conditions in respect of child labour, environment and ISO 9000, 
which have been imposed by the developed countries. Instead of 
devaluation, if these problems were attended to, as our neighbouring 
country has done, our carpets would never have suffered a setback in 
the exports. 
   
Another problem which the carpet exporters are facing is the non-
payment for their consignments by buyers on one plea or another. The 
government should have asked commercial counsellors to help the 
carpet exporters to realise their stuck up money.
    
Sports goods: Sports goods are also facing problems of child labour 
and environment to which the government should have paid maximum 
attention so that they could increase their exports. 
   
Our footballs, cricket balls and bats are used in internationals 
matches but for the last two years a vile propaganda has been going 
on against these goods. The government has failed to counter it. If 
it had been done, export of these items would have gone up without 
any adjustment of currency.
    
Leather and leather goods: The export of leather and leather goods 
has fallen on account of inconsistencies in the government policies. 
The problem of hides and skins, vet blue leather and finished 
leather remains unresolved. 
   
They are also a victim of drastic cut in their duty drawbacks. 
Although the PTA is making strenuous efforts to improve surrounding 
environment and it has been successful to a certain extent but 
propaganda against Pakistan in the international market is still 
continuing. Export of finished leather has shown an increase inspite 
of all odds. The tanners need better environment, correct duty 
drawbacks and solution of their problems instead of devaluation.
    
Surgical instruments face almost the situation as other items.
    
Fruits and vegetable: These can have a big market but in their case 
storage, gradation and packing are the adverse factor, not the 
prices. Apples of Balochistan, dates of Sindh and Balochistan, and 
mangoes of Multan and Bahawalpur can fetch higher prices without 
lowering the value of the currency. After 50 years, gradation and 
packing is as primitive as it ever was. No efforts have been made to 
improve thee. 
   
One has to visit the airport to see the shabby wooden crates of 
fruits and vegetables. Inspite of substantial freight concession, 
exports are not increasing as they should. Who in the international 
market would purchase these shabbily packed ungraded fruits? Best of 
fruit in such packing will never bring good price even if the 
currency is devalued heavily.
    
This practically disposes off all the major items of exports from 
Pakistan. It will appear that except for cotton and cotton yarn and 
devaluation would not serve the purpose for which it has been done. 
Following is the summary of exports, value in thousand dollars.
    
Mr Sartaj Aziz said that the decision was taken by State Bank, and 
it would help the export of agricultural products. But firstly there 
is little surplus of these commodities and secondly growers are not 
the beneficiaries because practically major portion of agricultural 
products go in the hands of big feudal lords on account of their 
major share due to "batai system" where the land belongs to absentee 
landlords and the Haris, Kissans and Muzarahs, toil and cultivate it 
by conceding lion's share of the yield to the owner of the land. The 
speculators, brokers and "arhthies" also hoard the agricultural 
products. We have seen this in the last Atta crisis.
    
Another argument advanced by Mr. Aziz is that it would reduce 
inflation and gave the examples of USA, Japan and Korea, completely 
out of context as far as Pakistan was concerned. 
   
He argued that the export to European Union and other countries 
would increase on account of better rupee returns on exports to 
these countries. 
   
He added that with devaluation, the Customs revenue would increase 
but he said nothing about the duty drawbacks which have not been 
increased accordingly. Mr Muhammad Ishaq Dar, the Commerce Minister, 
and Dr Hafiz Pasha all were very confident about the increase in 
exports and their major thrust in favour of devaluation was export 
promotion, unmindful of the high cost of production, raw materials 
and other inputs.
    
In heavily import-oriented economies like Pakistan, the fact is that 
the import bill neutralises the good effects of devaluation. 
Official import figures may be slightly low, but smuggling will 
increase.
    
The problems with Pakistan is that many-a-right decision have been 
taken at wrong time. About five years back India took the bold step 
of ending the system of 100 per cent managed value of dollar by the 
Reserve Bank. 
   
They first allowed their exporters to sell 40 per cent of their 
foreign earnings in the open market and afterwards lifted further 
controls. At that time many Pakistani economists and businessmen 
requested the government to take immediate corrective measures. 
  
We kept with the old regulated currency system, as is being done 
even now, and are facing the consequences. On the contrary the 
Indian rupee at that time dipped down to Rs 44 against the dollar 
but gradually recovered and is stable at around Rs 35 which is its 
real value. All indications are that the revamp devaluations will 
increase inflation. Certainly it would not help the value added 
textile industry in getting the desired boost-up. It is a fact that 
all the previous governments in the last ten years, including the 
present one, paid only lip service but did not take any practical 
steps to bail out this industry. 
   
The government incentives are generally limited to cotton and the 
spinning industry. This narrow approach has stifled the growth of 
industry and employment as well. The government is concentrating on 
non-traditional items when it is easier for them to increase the 
export of traditional ones. 
   
No doubt non-traditional export should be encouraged, but not at the 
cost of our regular exports. India which, in 1984 was far behind in 
export of textile, has increased it to over $12 billion and has set 
a target of $26 billion by the year 2000.
    
I suggest that the State Bank should start loosening its strong grip 
on the rupee in stages and a certain portion of export earnings be 
allowed to be sold in open market by the exporters. 
   
The State Bank should also direct all banks to allow, at the request 
of sellers, to hedge their sales made in other currencies with 
dollar without charging commission and pay the exporter their export 
proceeds in Pak rupees at dollar parity. Bank charges should be 
absorbed by the State Bank.

<a name="stru">Structural reforms creating grave social unrest</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

THE STATE Bank of Pakistan has again cut its repo rate by a half per 
cent to 18 per cent. On July 27 it had reduced its repo rate by a 
half per cent to 18.5 per cent.
    
The one per cent reduction in the repo rate within 3 months coupled 
with many similar steps including initiation of two-way open market 
operations indicates a major shift in monetary management that 
appears to be more market-oriented than before.
    
The move has come at a time when there is a huge surplus in the 
inter-bank money market that has caused a steep fall in the call and 
term rates. Besides the 1997-98 credit allocation of Rs 82 billion 
for the private sector remains almost intact as the first quarter 
ended with no drawdown on the same. Instead there was a Rs 14 
billion inflow in that head on account of the private debt 
retirement.
    
The State Bank has become much more autonomous and is asserting 
itself and is taking control of the instruments of monetary 
management.
    
But the question that haunts bankers and businessmen alike is 
whether an appropriate monetary policy can deliver in the absence of 
an equally appropriate fiscal policy as well as political stability? 
The answer, a big NO.
    
The participants of the recently-held meeting of the National Credit 
Consultative Committee — the supreme advisory body on the national 
credit plan — rather subscribed to the appropriateness of this 
answer when it came to the fore that on the one hand the private 
sector laments non-availibility of funds despite the credit 
allocation having been unused and on the other it also complains of 
a grave lull in industrial activity.
    
Analysed in its right perspective the situation is as follows:
    
Industrial activity is not picking up because the transitory phase 
of the structural reforms have reduced the purchasing power of the 
people but at the same time the industrialists are desparately 
looking for additional funds to run their day-to-day business or 
else to diversify their production line in the hope of creating new 
clientele.
    
On the other hand, banks are wallowing in excess liquidity that has 
rolled in as a result of monetary reforms and slowing down of 
economic activity and not due to an increased volume of business, 
but they are reluctant to advance loans fearing any expansion in 
their already huge infected loan portfolios that they have failed to 
contain even through the much-trumpeted June 5 special scheme of 
recovery of loans and revival of sick units.
    
While the country's economic managers boast of a successful 
completion of a crucial phase of structural reforms, the fact is it 
has reduced the purchasing power so drastically that trading and 
industrial activity seems to be at a halt.
    
Executives including those running multinationals here say their 
sale volumes have gone down; they are finding it difficult to create 
artificial demand any more, even after employing expensive and 
innovative advertising techniques. 
    
Traders say there is no buying to be seen anywhere, not even at 
grand concessional fairs and at the popular weekly bazars.
    
So what is going wrong and where? The State Bank Governor, Dr 
Muhammad Yaqub says the State Bank is now autonomous and is 
relatively free in making monetary policies. Finance Minister Sartaj 
Aziz says the economy is ready to take an upturn as a result of the 
structural reforms undertaken.
    
But the common man continues to suffer from back-breaking inflation 
and one is at his wits end to calculate the havoc a fast-approaching 
high rate of joblessness would play. 
   
The menace of joblessness continues to grow with the large scale 
lay-offs in banks and government organisations in the name of 
downsizing and restructuring.
    
Those sitting at the helm of banks and state-run organisations play 
with statistics to show that a laid-off employee would earn this 
much or that much amount by investing whatever he is being offered 
in the name of golden handshake, but they forget that the 
depression-cum-inflation, the economy is passing through would badly 
expose their claim.
    
Coming to specifics: Let us see what is happening in the banking 
sector and how it is adding to the miseries of the common man.
    
Currently, thousands of employees of state-run banks and development 
financial institutions are being thrown out of jobs in the name of 
downsizing through golden handshake or direct retrenchment, as is 
the case with the UBL.
    
Those carrying out this exercise believe it will help them save 
billions of rupees every year and make banking institutions more 
efficient. But they have hardly taken a realistic view of the impact 
of this exercise on the economy as a whole and the banking sector in 
particular.
    
Since the economy is faced with a depression, it presently offers 
little opportunities of mixing enterprise with money and since the 
sacked employees cannot get an entrepreneur's skill overnight, most 
of them would be forced to commit the folly of placing their 
retirement benefits in bank accounts, only to earn a negative rate 
of return.
    
There is no denying the fact that the return on savings in Pakistan 
has been less than the real rate of inflation. Besides a large 
number of the sacked employees would not have much to save after 
adjustment of their loans and overdrafts taken from the banks they 
used to serve and after meeting urgent financial requirements like 
running the household for a few initial months of joblessness and 
other pressing obligations.
    
Accepting the facts as they are, the retrenched employees would 
continue to be jobless, inflation may not come down and the current 
spell of depression in economic activity may go on.
    
So what needs to be done? The sooner the economic managers of the 
country find a realistic and practical answer to this question, the 
better it is for the government as well as for the country.
    
While finding an answer, the government will have to accept that it 
has miserably failed to foster political stability and discharge its 
socio-political obligations which impedes the realisation of desired 
results through monetary reforms.
    
The first and foremost object of all the structural and monetary 
reforms that the country underwent recently was to ensure revival of 
economic activity and making cheap goods and services available at 
an affordable price to the people.
    
But every day experience says that economic activity is not picking 
up and the inflationary impact of the structural and monetary 
reforms has eroded the buying power of the poeple to an extent where 
it would be sheer optimism to hope that economic activity would pick 
up in the near future.
    
This conclusion may apparently seem to have been drawn out of 
pessimism but is based on a review of as things stand.
    
The major setbacks our economy received in 1996-97 is no secret, not 
at least after the release of the State Bank annual report that 
calls it one of the most difficult and disappointing years in the 
history of Pakistan.
    
It is true that this goverment came into power in the second half of 
the last fiscal and as such did not contribute much to the 
deterioration of economic conditions, but it should be borne in mind 
that the structural and monetary reforms that had been initiated 
towards the end of the PPP government and continued during the 
caretakers period, took the country by storm during the present 
political set-up.
    
That the present set-up may be upset due to the negative impacts of 
the structural reforms is quite obvious. 
    
The period the country is passing through can best be described as 
transitory, more so because the reforms so far undertaken may take a 
long time to show positive effects and that too if supported by 
political stability and coherent economic policies. 
   
If the leadership had the vision, it would have been living in an 
altogether changed political atmosphere, less polluted with 
polarisation.

<a name="isde">Is debt cause for jubilation?</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem

WE HAVE BECOME a people that celebrate new loans as if it were a 
matter of true national euphoria. We have a government that is 
trying awfully hard to cure the cancer of debt with more debt.
    
By the time we are successful there may not be very many Pakistanis 
left to celebrate, but we as a leading example shall surely go into 
the Guinness Book of World Records. The World Bank would then have 
its first genuine accomplishment in its 50 years of attempting to 
alleviate poverty from the face of this planet.
    
The entire Ministry of Finance was euphoric when we raised a loan of 
some $200 million by pledging the future earnings of Pakistan 
Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL).

    
Every time we are able to raise a few hundred million dollars by 
issuing sovereign-guaranteed bonds, the ministry makes it a point to 
let everybody in the country know as to how smart it really is.
    
When we get tired of holding our 'begging bowls' in Europe we move 
over to Japan and feel even more elated at the possibility of 
raising yen-denominated debt. 'Samurai bonds', as we lovingly call 
them haven't yet been floated but we are going ecstatic at the 
opportunity of being able to raise even more debt by selling the 
future earnings of Pakistanis working abroad.
    
How about selling the future dollar-denominated ticket sales of 
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA)? Our government must take on 
more debt. Our leading political lights must also learn that true 
success is merely overcoming the fear of being unsuccessful. The 
financial whiz kids working for high-powered foreign banks are 
enriching their institutions by dumping their wizardry on our docile 
finance bureaucracy. The ministry, however, is exhilarated and 
Sartaj Aziz is thrilled while the rest of the nation is euphoric. No 
one should now have the right to blow out anybody's candle. We must 
also continue celebrating more debt coming our way, if nothing more 
than a means of being successful at befouling the international 
lending community.
    
Look at the Karachi Stock market, for instance. They have never been 
known to be a logical herd but celebrating a new $1.56 billion IMF 
loan, that would take us even closer to the frightening $60 billion 
national debt-mark, is for the psychiatrists to unravel.
    
The Pakistan Psychiatric Society (PPS) has always considered Karachi 
to be a good place for business.  The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE), 
the cotton exchange and the foreign banking hub has always been very 
kind to PPS supplying the society with a well-heeled clientele. In 
the recent past, however, the PPS seems to be reviewing its strategy 
as they feel that Islamabad may actually become a more lucrative 
market. Washington-based World Bank Chief Mr James Wolfensohn (a 
lawyer-turned banker) has said that he is "satisfied with Pakistan's 
fiscal position."
    
Washington is a city known for nurturing the highest per-capita 
population of lawyers. Its time for PPS to be pointing their guns at 
Washington as well.

<a name="epzs">EPZs being planned for Quetta, Gwadar</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
S. Azam Ali

QUETTA, Nov 3: Two export processing zones, one each at Gwadar and 
Quetta will be set up to boost Pakistan's exports to the Gulf states 
on one side, and Afghanistan and Central Asian states through 
Balochistan sea and overland routes, on the other, reliable sources 
disclosed here on Monday.
    
According to these sources, the aim is to accelerate the pace of 
industrial investment in Balochistan and increase exports to 
potential export markets in the region with emphasis on ECO 
countries and the Gulf states. Another objective is to ensure 
transfer of technology and creation of job opportunities.
    
The projects in export processing zones will be allowed if at least 
sixty per cent of annual production is exported. 
    
The hi-tech electronics and engineering industries have been 
exempted from this condition provided there are arrangements for 
transfer of technology.
    
These sources maintain that maximum foreign equity for these units 
would be 40 per cent. This may include investment by non-resident 
Pakistanis. If the foreign equity in a unit is 51 per cent its 
export requirement will be reduced to fifty per cent of the annual 
production.
    
Main incentives and facilities for investors and industrialists to 
be available in these export processing zones will include income 
tax holiday for five years, from the date of commencement of 
commercial production, complete exemption from customs duty, sales 
tax, import and Iqra charges on import of plant and machinery not 
manufactured in Pakistan.

<a name="fore">Foreign investment decline by 27.3pc</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov 4: Foreign investment in Pakistan during 1996-97 
totalled $949.5 m, indicating a sharp 27.3% drop from $1306.7m 
during the preceding year, according to the latest official 
statistics available on Tuesday.
    
Thus the last financial year witnessed the lowest level since 1994-
95 when foreign investment had stood at $1532.3m including $442.4m 
on account of foreign direct investment (FDI) and $1089.9m as 
portfolio investment, probably attributable to the flotation of PTC 
shares in overseas capital markets.
    
By 1996-97, FDI had dropped to $682.1m (down from $1101.7m in 1995-
96) and portfolio investment to $267.7m tons. The statistics show a 
sizable $62m increase last year in portfolio investment as compared 
to 1995-96.
    
Apart from these fluctuations in the last three years, the 1990s, 
nevertheless, show a positive trend so far as foreign investment is 
concerned. In 1990-91, it had totalled $237m after subtracting 
negative flow of portfolio investment to the tune of $9.0m. In the 
subsequent year, however, foreign investment more than doubled to 
$553.6m which included $218.5m received in the form of portfolio 
investment. The golden year of the decade was 1994-95 when F.I. 
reached $1532m mark.
    
Country-wise analysis shows that United States topped all the other 
countries in 1996-97 with a total investment of $357.5m constituting 
37.6% of total foreign investment in Pakistan. 
    
United Kingdom has vied with US for the top slot. Its share in 
foreign investment witnessed a sharp jump from only $82.0m in 1993-
94 to $282.6m in 1994-95 and to $399.8m in 1995-96. The year 1996-
97, however, saw a substantial drop of about $82m in UK's 
investment. Its portfolio investment, after peaking at $243.9m in 
1994-95 dwindled to $77.9m last year.
    
The increase by these two advanced countries in their FDI in 
Pakistan was accounted for mostly by private power projects. Thus 
their FDI constituted 59.1% of total FDI in 1995-96 and 71.2% during 
1996-97.
    
Only 12 countries account for as much as 85% of total foreign 
investment in Pakistan. These are USA, UK, UAE, Germany, France, 
Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Canada, Netherlands and South 
Korea.
    
A worrying aspect of the statistics is negative flow of foreign 
investment from Hong Kong and Saudi Arabia. 
   
The total foreign investment by Hong Kong stood at $29.6m in 1995-
96, as against minus $13.1m in 1996-97. This sudden drop is 
explained by negative flow of portfolio investment to the tune of 
$20.6m. In the case of Saudi Arabia, last year saw a negative flow 
of $17.0m on account of FDI as against 1995-96 when its total 
investment had amounted to $25.8 — all as FDI.

<a name="paki">Pakistanis in US present proposals to PM</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Correspondent

NEW YORK, Nov 5: Pakistani financial experts and bank executives 
have requested Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to speed up 
implementation of the economic policy framework laid down by his 
government, to revive the idle industrial sector, and to speed up 
the privatization process.
    
A group of eight US-based Pakistani bank executives and investors, 
led by the executive vice-president of Citibank, Shaukat Aziz, who 
had met the prime minister and his economic team in Islamabad on 
Sunday, submitted a 75-page report suggesting ways and means to spur 
on the still-staggering economy.
    
The prime minister, according to financial experts attending the 
talks, assured them that their suggestions would be assimilated into 
the government's economic policies.
    
According to an investor who had participated in the talks, the 
meeting took an overview of the global economic events, specially 
the downturn in the South Asian economies and its implications on 
Pakistan.
    
While noting that Mr Sharif's government was pro-business, the 
Pakistani financial experts stressed the need to improve the 
investors perceptions about Pakistan. They underscored the 
importance of clarifying the vision of the future economic activity 
as perceived by the policy makers in Pakistan.
    
The experts told the prime minister that the decisions and policies 
should be clearly defined and notified to the foreign investors 
directly by the key players in Pakistan. "We end up reading about 
the changes in the newspapers which are often murky and unclear," 
they told the prime minister.
    
Emphasizing the need to speed up the privatization process, the 
financial experts asked the prime minister to add 50 to 100 
professionals in various economic sectors as they could prove to be 
catalysts in reviving the economy.
    
They asked the prime minister to institute a massive training 
project in order to re-orient and train the civil servants in order 
to equip them with skills to manage the deregulated economy which 
they felt was essential to the speedy growth.
    
The prime minister was informed that while the changes in the 
economic policies were good, their implementation was lagging far 
behind and close follow-ups were needed to realize the full benefits 
of the new initiatives taken by his government.

<a name="real">Real estate being opened up to foreign investment</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov 6: Federal Minister for Commerce, Ishaq Dar said on 
Thursday that Pakistan is in the process of opening up new sectors 
like the infrastructure, housing and real estate, wholesaling and 
retailing, health and education to foreign investment.
    
He added that the government would announce a new investment policy 
towards the end of this month to provide a very enabling environment 
to the foreign investors.

Enumerating the incentives being given to the local and foreign 
investors under the new regime he said, foreign exchange controls 
have been relaxed and 100 per cent equity participation has been 
allowed to the foreign investors.
    
*Ceiling on payment of royalty and technical fees has also been 
abolished.
    
*No prior approval for investment in any sector is required except 
arms and ammunition, high explosives, radio active substances, and 
security printing, currency and mint.
    
*Export processing zones with infrastructure, one-window facility 
and tax holidays, have been established.
    
*Tariff rates have been brought down to maximum of 45 per cent on a 
cascading basis.
    
*Special industrial zones have been planned along the motorway.
    
*Income tax has been reduced by almost half, and the tax base 
widened, investment in debt instruments has been exempted from tax, 
and incentives provided for value-added exports.
    
He said all these steps have been approved and appreciated by the 
IMF and the World Bank and Pakistan's long-standing friends. The IMF 
has, a fortnight earlier, cleared Pakistan's request for a short 
term ESAF/EEF facility of $1.558 billion.

<a name="rese">Forex reserves fall by $125m</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 6: Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves slipped by $125 
million to $1.514 billion on November 1 from $1.639 billion on 
October 25.
    
A State Bank report released on Thursday showed the approved foreign 
exchange reserves at $1.145 billion on November 1 up slightly from 
$1.143 billion on October 25. It put the balances held outside 
Pakistan at $368.8 million against $415.3 million reported on 
October 25.
    
The fall in reserves is expected to be compensated during the week 
ending November 7 since a sum of $157 million was debited to the 
State Bank account by the IMF on November 4 as part of the first 
transche of $208 million of a $1.56 billion medium term loan. The 
IMF had already debited $51 million to the State Bank account on 
October 23.

<a name="equi">Equities post modest gains in brief session</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 7: Stock prices on Friday rose modestly in a brief 
sessions as foreign investors covered positions at the lower levels 
amid light trading.
    
The trading has to be suspended just an hour after the opening bell 
as most of the staff members could not reach the office owing to 
strike called by the religious parties to protest the killing of top 
Ulema in a terrorist attack on Sunday last.
    
The market opened at the official time of 9.15 a.m but was closed at 
10.30 a.m. as the attendance in the rings was thin in the absence of 
leading brokers and their agents.
    
The KSE 100-share index managed to finish with a gain of 1.98 points 
at 1,847.15 as compared to 1,845.17 a day earlier as some of the 
leading base shares managed to finish modestly higher.
    
The market capitalization also showed a modest rise of Rs 607.422m 
at Rs 558.680 billion as compared to Rs 558.073 billion a day 
earlier as highly capitalized shares managed to finish higher or 
unchanged.
    
The increase was largely attributed to good performance turned in by 
the leading shares, notably PSO, Hub-Power, PTCL, and some others 
including Adamjee Insurance and MCB.
    
Floor brokers said the opening was fairly promising as some of the 
foreign funds were in the rings and made active covering purchases 
on the selected counters.
    
Although the city was tense amid conflicting rumours about violence 
in the wake of strike, those who were present in the rings made 
extensive buying, sending signals that the market has shrugged off 
some of its current inhibitions,they added.
    
"That could well mean investors will be back in the rings by the 
next week and cover positions, putting the market back on the 
rails", said a leading floor broker.
    
Bulk of the buying interest was again centred around the energy 
shares at the lower levels as leading foreign funds covered 
positions at the lower levels.
    
Dealers said the energy sector should have put the market back on 
the rails if the trading was not suspended .
    
Although, Shell Pakistan consolidated its overnight sharp gain, both 
PSO and Pakistan Refinery maintained their upward drive and were 
quoted further sharply higher.
    
Kohinoor Energy remained in the limelight and ended with a fresh 
good gain on active support on rumours that a foreign party is 
taking an equity stake in it.
    
Volume was light at 2.288m shares, while out of the 29 actives, 17 
ended higher, six fell and as many stayed unchanged.
    
But most of the gains were fractional barring Kohinoor Energy, PSO 
and Pakistan Refinery, which posted gains ranging from Rs 1.05 to Rs 
5. Adamjee Insurance also came in for active support and was marked 
up by Rs 5 as some foreign made active buying apparently on some 
positive news.
    
Barring Exided Pakistan, which fell by Rs 4.50 after being ex-
dividend, other losses were modest ranging from 15 paisa to 75 
paisa.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, unchanged on 0.805m 
shares followed by Kohinoor Energy,up Rs 1.05 on 0.503m shares; 
PTCL, unchanged on 0.350m shares; ICI Pakistan, unchanged on 0.400m 
shares.
    
The other actively traded shares were led by Southern Electric, up 
20 paisa on 64,000 shares; Sui Northern Gas, higher 25 paisa on 
54,500 shares; and Sui Southern Gas, firm 15 paisa on 42,000 shares. 
There were some other deals also.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

"THE rulers of the country, good, bad or indifferent will continue 
to get away with both evil and nonsense for as long as they continue 
to keep illiterate the 120-odd million over whom they rule.
    
"Some comfort, however,comes to us from the signals sent by certain 
members of our judiciary, men of conscience who feel that all does 
not augur well for the future of law and justice in Pakistan." 
(Dawn, November 25, 1994).
    
Since this was written, the 120 million have risen to 140 million 
and the comfort signals sent to us by certain members of our 
judiciary have somewhat evaporated.
    
In the past week, many pretences have been washed away and it has 
now become clear to most of us exactly where each player in the game 
now being played between the parliament and the judiciary stands, 
and what each wants at the cost of the country and its people. There 
is little left for the skirts now to cover.
    
The President, Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan, Tumandar of all the 
Legharis, aspires for a second term, as did his predecessor in 
office, Ghulam Ishaq. He will take a 'principled stand', backing the 
principles which will help him achieve his aim. At the same time, he 
is vulnerable and fears Article 47 of the Constitution, ("Removal or 
impeachment of the President,") for he is aware, as are the others 
aware, of his acts of omission and commission. Only two-thirds of 
the total membership of both Houses at a joint sitting is necessary 
to decide his fate. He also fears the 'hereafter' on Mother Earth.
    
Senate Chairman, Rhodes Scholar Waseem Sajjad, continues to be 
economical with the truth, as he was so long ago, when the then COAS 
Aslam Beg, the man who wears shades in the shade sent for him. He 
would like to be president rather than merely 'acting' on occasions. 
He is dolled up and waiting in the wings.
    
The prime minister, Mian of Lahore Nawaz Sharif, head of the 
executive and of the legislature, has despotic tendencies which, to 
his credit and in his ignorance, he does not even pretend to hide. 
He depends on what he calls his overwhelming mandate. Democracy 
being what it is in this country, as reported in this newspaper on 
October 30:

"Sources said the prime minister told the meeting that he enjoyed a 
massive support and was ready to go to the people in case he was 
forced to accept the decision of the Supreme Court. They said the 
issue of resigning from the prime ministership was also discussed at 
the meeting. Nawaz Sharif said he would come back with a bigger 
majority in case fresh elections were held. However, he expressed 
fears that the country would plunge into chaos and that everything 
would become uncertain in case he stepped down or was thrown out 
through illegal and unlawful means."
    
And on October 31, from other sources: "We are ready to hammer out 
an agreement with the CJ in the larger interest of the country. In 
spite of a massive mandate, the prime minister is ready to find a 
solution to the crisis. But nobody should think that he (Nawaz) is 
weak."
    
Did he have to make public his weakness and how useless and light 
his heavy mandate really is?
    
On the high that he was, he suspended rules, prohibited debate and 
rushed through the 13th Amendment, emasculating the president and 
theoretically strengthening his hold over the army. Not content, in 
exactly the same manner he rushed through parliament the 14th 
Amendment, prohibiting dissent, and under which an elected 
representative would be disqualified on the ground of defection — 
defection being defined as: "a Member of the House shall be deemed 
to defect from a political party if he ...(a) commits a breach of 
party discipline, which means a violation of the party constitution, 
code of conduct, and declared policies, or (b) votes contrary to any 
direction issued by the parliamentary party to which he belongs, or 
(c) abstains from voting in the House against any party policy in 
relation to any Bill."
    
Should any member be guilty of any of the above three, the head of a 
party (for all intents and purposes judge, prosecutor, defence 
counsel, and jury) can order that he be disqualified and lose his 
seat.
    
What this 14th Amendment in effect did was to cut the number of 
members of the House to merely the leaders of the political parties 
therein represented, rendering party members dumb shadows. What is 
distressing is that this amendment was passed with a majority of 
over two-thirds of both Houses. Not one, repeat, not one, member 
stood up, spoke for democracy and recorded his vote of dissent. 
Fascism that day took firm root. All that then remained to be 
destroyed was the moral force of the judiciary and the physical 
force of the army.
    
Even now, at this late stage, it would be worth telling Nawaz Sharif 
and his desk-thumpers how democracy really works. Last week in the 
land of the Mother of Parliaments, a senior Tory MP, Peter Temple-
Morris, seriously considered defecting from his party over party 
leader William Hague's decision to fight the next election on a 
campaign opposing the European single currency, despite the 
assurance by the party whips that he would be able to both vote 
against his own party's line in the Commons and campaign against it 
at the next election. However, rather than be treated as a sort of 
'licensed leper' during the election, he chose resignation. He wrote 
to his local association in his constituency telling them that the 
Tory leader's new stance was contrary to his personal statement at 
the last election, and that he would be resigning his seat. Being 
sympathetic to Labour Prime Minister Blair's reform agenda and 
policies in general, his intention was to cross over to the Labour 
party. If accepted, he would be given a chance in a suitable 
byelection. That is how defection works. However, as things turned 
out, with a change of policy stances on the single currency issue by 
both the Labour party and Tories, Temple-Morris has since changed 
his mind and will not defect.
    
Coming back to droll reality, Chief Justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali 
Shah this August recommended the elevation of five High Court judges 
to the bench of the Supreme Court, three of them from the Lahore 
High Court. Nawaz Sharif needed LHC Chief Justice Shaikh Riaz and 
wanted him to remain in Lahore, and he felt that the other two, 
Munir and Arif, would prove hostile to him in the Supreme court. We 
all know too well how he fought to keep these three where they are.
    
The Chief Justice, on October 29, struck. After admitting a petition 
filed against the 14th Amendment, after hearing the petitioner's 
lawyer, he gave an interim order suspending the amendment. He did so 
without hearing the government counsel, Sharifuddin Pirzada, who had 
been flown from Karachi to Islamabad in a special plane. Since then, 
the government has been trying to rush through the 15th Amendment to 
the Constitution amending Article 191, the first draft of which 
reads:
 
"191, Rules of procedure: (1) Subject to clauses (2) and (3), the 
Supreme Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure 
of the Court.
    
"(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (1), serious cases 
involving critical constitutional issues shall be heard by all the 
judges of the Court or so many judges thereof as may be available 
and willing to sit on the bench.
    
"(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in clause (1) but subject to 
clause (2), the benches, roster and fixation of cases before the 
Supreme Court shall be regulated by a panel consisting of the Chief 
Justice and the two senior-most judges."
    
(Article 191, now reads: "Subject to the Constitution and law, the 
Supreme Court may make rules regulating the practice and procedure 
of the Court.")
 
The amendment would clip the wings of the Chief Justice. But how to 
get it through both Houses? Palms have already been extended for 
alms.
    
What else remains to go into the cauldron? A petition challenging 
the validity of the 13th Amendment has been filed. The CJ can also 
suspend this one. The president can come to the aid of the Supreme 
Court and notify the five judges, or he can do nothing and please 
the government.
   
The government can impeach the president. The prime minister can be 
disqualified. Each man in power has many weapons up his sleeve which 
he will wield in the name of anything held to be 'holy'.
    
Daggers have been drawn, blood will be spilt, whose depending upon 
the army decree. We must be thankful that we have a decent 
individual, General Jehangir Karamat, as Chief of Army Staff. 
Unfortunately the same cannot be said for many of his officers.

Noon, Friday October 31. Epilogue: Sense has prevailed. After 
wasting two months of valuable time, Nawaz Sharif has realized that 
time should not be wasted on non-issues. Let us hope that now, when 
he starts his third term as prime minister, he also realizes that 
the nation will not accept his brand of fascism.

<a name="thez">The zone of good governance</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

FOR most travellers setting foot in Pakistan for the first time, the 
first experience consists of fighting their way through a mob of 
smelly, pushy taxi drivers and their touts blocking the exit of the 
airport and harassing them mercilessly as they emerge with their 
luggage.
    
Miraculously, this state of affairs has undergone a sudden and 
dramatic change at Karachi's Quaid-i-Azam International airport. The 
pick-up-and-drop lane, usually clogged with so-called VIP cars, is 
now used only for the purpose for which it was intended. Taxis now 
queue up, and passengers get into the one at the head of the line, 
and the next one moves up. The lane previously used by cabs is now 
reserved for Civil Aviation Authority vehicles, and the car park has 
been divided into clearly marked zones. In short, for the first time 
that I can remember, there is sanity and order at the airport.
    
So how did this transformation take place? The answer says more 
about governance in Pakistan — or the lack of it — than a hundred 
seminars in 5-star hotels could.
    
In order to fully appreciate what has been achieved at the Karachi 
airport, try and imagine a single place in Pakistan today where a 
car with government or defence forces number plates can be towed 
away. VIP culture has been so deeply ingrained into every level of 
our administration that it is normally inconceivable for a cop to 
even think about taking action against the high and mighty. 
Foreigners who fly into Karachi for the first time now will probably 
not even notice that there is no chaos at the airport, but those of 
us who had despaired of any possibility of improvement can now 
rejoice in the possibility of positive change, given the will and 
commitment.
    
While a number of individuals and agencies should be given credit 
for this transformation, the idea and impetus came from a small core 
group of concerned citizens. I know Sami Mustafa will not be happy 
at being singled out, but I am mentioning his role as many readers 
are already familiar with his name. Apart from being an occasional 
contributor to this newspaper, his Book Group has done marvellous 
work in making attractive, high-quality books available to 
underprivileged schoolchildren at reasonable prices. Among other 
initiatives, he, in conjunction with the Citizens- Police Liaison 
Committee, has sorted out the traffic nightmare in a Karachi 
locality that has a large number of private schools.
    
Basically, the idea behind bringing sanity to the traffic at the 
Karachi airport was to demonstrate that despite all the pessimism 
and cynicism, good governance is possible. This particular area was 
selected because it is the most visible demonstration of our VIP 
culture as well as the chaos that has become symbolic of Pakistan. 
How Sami Mustafa and his friends managed to put their ideas into 
practice is an object lesson in persistence as well as the 
possibilities in the cooperation between concerned citizens and 
dedicated government officials. Fortunately for us, the latter are 
not yet an extinct species.
    
Sami's group first held a series of meetings with senior Sindh 
government officials, including police officers, and convinced them 
of the pressing need to sort out the mess at the airport. The 
informal working group knew they would be treading on sensitive toes 
if they were to uniformly enforce the rule of law. However, they all 
agreed that the experiment would fail if they started making 
exceptions. The next step was to convince the army corps commander, 
as well as the senior air force and navy officers based in Karachi, 
that their vehicles should not block the pick-up-and-drop lane.
    
Actually, getting the cooperation of the civil and military 
bureaucracy at the highest level was easier than convincing taxi 
drivers that they had to abide by the rules and stop jumping the 
queue. The yellow cab association invoked Mr Nawaz Sharif's name as 
their patron saint, and threatened dire action if their members were 
made to toe the line. But the group pressed ahead regardless, and 
the new arrangements are now in place, proving that with the right 
mix of circumstances and individuals, change is possible.
    
And herein lies the rub: How many people do we have who will invest 
their own time and money for civic action? As the level of 
governance has fallen progressively, the number of individuals and 
NGOs attempting to fill the vacuum has multiplied, but obviously, 
they cannot play the government's role as they have neither the 
manpower nor the money. Ultimately, there is no substitute for the 
state. And this is the point Sami and his group are making: unless 
government officials and agencies are involved, there can be no 
long-term solution to the crisis of governance that has taken the 
country to the brink.
    
For them, sorting out the traffic at Karachi airport was merely a 
demonstration, not an end in itself. When they took turns at 
monitoring the situation around the clock and then hired people to 
report violations, they did so in the hope that their work would 
have repercussions beyond the airport. Just as a pebble thrown into 
a pool causes ripples far beyond the point of impact, so too they 
would like to see the area of good governance expand to other parts 
and institutions of Pakistan.
    
One objection Sami and his friends have to the model created by the 
partial success of NGOs is that they start with the assumption that 
the state, its organs and its servants are a hindrance rather than a 
help. Thus, while they may achieve a certain measure of success, 
their work usually cannot be replicated, and hence have limited 
impact on the overall crisis of governance. The airport project has 
demonstrated that in order to make a difference, there is no option 
but to co-opt government agencies and officials.
    
This brings us to the next problem, and that is how to ensure that 
other groups of citizens have the same zeal and powers of persuasion 
that Sami Mustafa and his friends have displayed? And how many civil 
servants like Mirza Qamar Beg, and police officers like Asad 
Jehangir and Saleem Wahidi, are willing to push through a project 
which may make them unpopular, and will certainly not advance their 
careers?
    
And yet it is clear that unless we try, we will never know how many 
motivated citizens and government officials will emerge from their 
drawing rooms and offices and expand the zone of good governance 
until it covers the whole country.

<a name="limi">Limits of a popular mandate</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
M.H. Askari

THE impatience of the leaders — even of those who come to power with 
a solid popular mandate — with state institutions which by their 
very nature limit the exercise of unbridled political power in any 
democratic system has been a disconcerting factor in Pakistani 
politics and this, perhaps more than anything else can explain the 
situation which confronted Pakistan recently.
    
It is not always remembered that the line separating democracy from 
the authoritarianism of an ostensible democratic government which 
derives its power from the massive support that it may command in 
the legislature is very thin.
    
There can be no question of the immense mandate which has brought Mr 
Nawaz Sharif to power and when he was sworn in as prime minister in 
March there could have been no question of his not being able to 
complete his full tenure of five years. However the past few weeks 
have seen doubts being expressed over and over again whether he 
would be able to remain in office for the full tenure. Even now when 
the immediate question of the appointment of judges to the Supreme 
Court seems to have been settled to the satisfaction of all parties 
concerned, the veteran politician Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan has 
declared that the all-parties conference which was held in Islamabad 
recently would mobilise public opinion for a change of government 
"as the existing leadership had failed to deliver the goods."
    
Even more alarmingly, there has been a demand, mercifully from a 
small section of the people, for the restoration of the President's 
powers to dissolve the national assembly and dismiss the government 
under an article of the constitution which has since been expunged. 
The powers to do so had been arrogated to the office of President by 
the late Gen Zia-ul-Haq under the authority of his martial law.
    
Unfortunately it is not always remembered that there are lessons to 
be learnt from Pakistan's recent history. While at the outset, 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's power base was as solid as it can be, towards 
the latter part of his tenure he began to lean more and more on what 
have been called the coercive elements of state authority. In 1973, 
Bhutto abolished the elitist CSP cadre of the bureaucracy, in 
keeping with egalitarian reforms of the system which he had promised 
in his party manifesto in 1970. But not much later whatever remained 
of the civil services began to be heavily politicised.
    
Finally, as many observers have pointed out, Bhutto's need to secure 
the tacit support of the civil and military bureaucracy, and even of 
the police, an elite section of which he converted into the Federal 
Security Force (FSF), increased his dependence on state authority 
and eroded his popular base. In the end, as it is only too well 
known, the FSF was given a free rein to suppress all opposition.
    
In dealing with the non-PPP governments in Balochistan and the NWFP 
also, Bhutto exploited his massive popular support to strengthen his 
highly centralised style of government. This led to his seeking more 
and more support from the military which he had, at the beginning of 
his regime, attempted to trim and prune. Ironically, it was his 
misplaced confidence in being able to mobilise support from the 
army, as evident from his imposition of martial law on a selective 
basis to deal with the post-1977 election agitation, that proved 
Bhutto's undoing. His own hand-picked army chief, who had started 
scheming against him as soon as the agitation started, deposed him 
through a coup at a time when he least expected and finally had him 
executed. It is clear that in his ambition to wield absolute 
political power, Bhutto had squandered the moral support of the 
massive political base that he had been able to build during his 
years in political wilderness.
    
It was practically the same that happened to Benazir Bhutto who 
first came to power on the crest of popular support. Mesmerised with 
the adulatory slogans by the crowds in the major cities which turned 
out to greet her on her return from self-exile in 1986, Benazir 
Bhutto failed to realise that the elections in 1988 had given her 
only a nominal majority in the national assembly. It is known that 
she as well as her close aides were totally unaware of the moves 
made by the then President, Ghulam Ishaq khan, which culminated with 
her government being summarily dismissed through a presidential 
order.
    
It was perhaps her popular support which remained intact despite the 
presidential action which brought her back to power in 1993. But 
then, as the Asian Wall Street Journal was to say in its editorial 
after Murtaza Bhutto's murder (as quoted by Mr Roedad Khan in his 
recently published account of the vicissitudes of Pakistan) that 
"arrogance of pharaonic proportions was to lead her toward political 
doom." The editorial also said that she remained woefully unaware of 
the opposition which was building up against her and "instead of 
trying to mend her ways (she) continued to blame everyone but 
herself for Pakistan's woes."  There are innumerable factors which 
have hampered the growth of the democratic process in Pakistan. The 
South Asia scholar Lawrence Ziring in his "Pakistan: The Enigma of 
Political Development" has even argued that "Pakistan's leaders 
never intended to rest the national foundation (of the country) on a 
constitutional rock." However, it is easy to see that it is the 
leaders, though being the product of democratic process, who have 
most undermined the foundations of Pakistan's democracy.
    
The standoff between Mr Nawaz Sharif's government and the higher 
judiciary was perhaps the most unnecessary and bizarre and yet the 
most avoidable development, something that had the potential to rock 
the very foundations of the political process which has only 
recently started to stabilise.
    
Ironically, the crisis began in what to the layman appears to have 
been essentially a routine matter: the chief justice recommending 
the appointment of five judges to the Supreme Court and the federal 
government calling upon him to "review" his demand. The deadlock 
which ensued was subjected to prolonged "negotiations" between the 
Chief Justice and, somewhat unexpectedly, the chief minister of 
Punjab, but these did not lead to any positive outcome. The Chief 
Justice subsequently decided not to negotiate any more with the 
government and the government at this stage even contemplated a move 
to curtail the strength of the Supreme Court through legislative 
action, but, however, decided not to do so at the last minute.
    
However, the stand-off remained stalemated, with the Chief Justice 
insisting upon his recommendation of elevation of five judges to the 
apex court while the government remained unresponsive. There were 
reports that the matter had been under review among others by the 
President and the Chief of Army Staff.
    
The National Assembly by adopting a resolution on October 29 
reiterating the supremacy of the parliament over all other organs of 
state appeared to reaffirm its authority to amend the constitution 
and fix the number of judges comprising the Supreme Court. There was 
then disturbing speculation that the President may be impeached or 
that the country may be placed under martial law — which fortunately 
turned out to be baseless.
    
In a statesman-like statement, free of any contentiousness, the 
prime minister told the National Assembly on October 31 that the 
government had decided to implement the Chief Justice's 
recommendation. The National Assembly then unanimously adopted a 
resolution raising to 17 the Supreme Court's strength.
    
The development has generally been received with a sense of relief 
and a spokesman of the Supreme Court has even said that the Chief 
Justice was "happy" and "satisfied" with it. In another development 
which cannot but be seen in the context of the government-judiciary 
standoff, the chief of army Staff, Gen Jahangir Karamat has 
reportedly been unhappy at the fact that the print media had been 
quoting him out of context. An ISPR statement said that "the army is 
clear about its role, position and responsibility" and that it has 
been functioning and will continue to function within the parameters 
of its responsibility. Nevertheless, it must be recognised that if 
the ultimate positive outcome of the prolonged crisis has in any way 
been influenced by the position adopted by the military 
establishment or the chief of staff, their role in having 
strengthened the foundation of democracy can only be appreciated.
    
The lesson to be drawn is that elected governments, too, should 
understand that there are clear parameters of their authority as 
enshrined in the Constitution and good governance demands that they 
should function within these parameters. Democracy lies in taking 
even those with you who are not necessarily supportive of your 
manifesto but with whom a consensus can always be established. 
Regardless of the temptation to cash in on a massive popular 
mandate, the business of the state should be conducted in a spirit 
of give and take.

<a name="bylo">By losing he has won</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Eqbal Ahmad

IT IS Pakistan's moment of glory. Wisdom has prevailed over folly. 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has won by losing. Mr Justice Sajjad Ali 
Shah has earned his title as the Chief Justice of Pakistan. The 
common good and the cause of democracy has been served. Very well 
indeed!
    
What should have been a routine matter developed into a grave 
constitutional crisis. All of last week I was reminded of a well 
known fable:
    
The river was full, and flowing vigorously. The scorpion had to get 
urgently across as his family were stranded on the land beyond, 
needing food and care. The scorpion entreated with the frog to take 
him across the river. The frog being scared of the scorpion's 
poisonous fangs, hesitated. But the creature had the gift of 
persuasion, and reason on his side. "How can I hurt you?" he asked 
the frog "If I bite you, you will die and I shall drown too." "You 
speak wisely scorpion," said the frog. "Fear, fowl and irrational, 
overwhelms me. But I must overcome it."
    
Thereupon, the frog embarked on the journey carrying the lucky 
scorpion on his back. As they reached mid-stream, the scorpion 
plunged his pincers into the back and underside of the frog. 
"Ouch!", he yelled "stop biting me as you will drown if I die." "I 
know", said the scorpion. "But I can't help it. It is my nature." At 
the expense of stating the obvious, one may offer the moral of the 
story: Instinct may compel behaviour that is counter to reason. When 
it does, instinct should be suppressed.
    
It took weeks, but the Prime Minister's reason prevailed over 
instinct, and just in time. In this land of political suicides this 
is a record. We have reason to celebrate. Mr Nawaz Sharif's 
government was swimming quite nicely through the stormy economic and 
social conditions it had inherited from its predecessor. Then in 
mid-stream, it began to commit harakiri as though driven by tragic 
nature.
    
A host of political opportunists, particularly of the opposition 
parties, abandoned caution and considerations of the national 
interest, to eke out their paltry profits from this constitutional 
crisis. History shall record these bit players as vultures of a very 
low order. The Prime Minister should take note that all his recent 
bows to obscurantism did not yield even a fraction of gratitude from 
the obscurantists he has sought to placate. But it has reinforced 
the sectarianism he has vowed to eradicate.
    
There is a premium in our political culture on confrontation rather 
than compromise. Mr Nawaz Sharif has shown courage in pulling back 
from the brink. He could have dug in his fangs, down and be drowned. 
He did not. He and his cabinet colleagues shall hopefully view this 
as a victory of reason, not a tactical retreat to be undone at a 
more opportune time. Democracy in Pakistan has been strengthened by 
it, and the government has not been weakened by any means. For Mr 
Sharif to perceive this as a defeat will be self-defeating.
    
The developments of the last four weeks hold, nevertheless, lessons 
that all should ponder for this country's sake and for democracy's. 
The first is that people in high office ought to distinguish between 
authority and power. Authority — the worthiness to be recognized as 
legitimate — is the civilizing factor behind power, the element that 
makes the difference between coercing a multitude and governing a 
society. Power — the ability to get what one wants, or to produce 
desired changes — progressively degenerates when it is de-linked 
from authority. The divorce between the two yields dictatorship, 
tyranny, rebellion, or anarchy. Political instability and military 
rule in Pakistan have been premised on the absence of linkages 
between power and authority. The future of democracy in this country 
rests on our will and capacity to associate power with authority.
    
Since Plato's time, political theorists have observed that 
concentration of power undermines authority. The converse is equally 
true: institutionalized devolution and separation of powers enhances 
the authority of the state, the government and those who preside 
over it. This is the golden rule of good organization generally. 
"How do you keep your vast organization running so smoothly?", I had 
once asked the head of General Motors Corporation. Came the prompt 
reply: "By allowing maximum autonomy to the managers of our various 
sectors." Added the corporate leader ironically: "The communists 
coined democratic centralism. We practise it." The Soviet Union fell 
apart not because power was decentralized there but because it was 
not. Strong men produce weak nations.
    
Concentration of power produces augmentation of institutionalized no 
less than individual anxieties. An observer of the fish bowl that is 
Islamabad saw what the Prime Minister and his advisors must finally 
have seen: Whatever his failings — and there were some — the 
sympathies, spoken and unspoken, of the press, the legal profession, 
the bureaucracy, and the army's officers' corps lay with the Chief 
Justice. Of course, Pakistan's soldier-in-chief became a visible and 
central player in the high game of politics.
   
More importantly, the constituency he represented was restive, very 
restive indeed. At work was anxiety, not ambition. The political 
class will do the country, and itself, a favour by comprehending the 
sources of this anxiety.
 
Today, there is no noticeable ambition to political power in the 
high command of the armed forces. To the contrary, their attention 
is focused on maintaining the army's autonomy, its ethos, 
professional integrity, and fighting capabilities in a world of lost 
friendships and shrinking supplies. Armies are rarely very 
articulate institutions; this one has inherited a colonial tradition 
of in-articulation.
    
Hence, its frustrations have to be understood by civilian leaders. 
It is an army that has ruled this country — long and badly — which 
is not a pleasant reminder. It has fought three wars without 
winning, and was badly defeated in one. It had a pyrrhic victory in 
a proxy war — Afghanistan's — as its military objective there — the 
attainment of something its theoreticians called 'strategic depth' — 
remains a remote dream. Its agenda in Kashmir is unfulfilled. To 
make matters worse, it is economically squeezed. Inflation is 
emaciating it as an institution, and its personnel individually. 
Jawans rarely get to eat meat; and officers are served meat just 
about twice a week.
    
In this bleak environment, its leaders cherish the army's autonomy 
and their unity of command and purpose. They get anxious when these 
are threatened. Like the bureaucracy, the judiciary, the press and 
professional organizations the army officers of today regard with 
apprehension the concentration of power in the executive branch of 
the government. Like others, they too regard devolution of power and 
a system of checks and balances as essential features of stable and 
democratic governance. To make matters worse, Prime Minister Sharif 
was perceived by many as prone to concentrating power in his office.
    
Rumours reinforced this perception. Rumours play a large role in our 
society. Official misuse of the media, which renders radio and 
television extremely unreliable sources of information, enhances the 
role of rumour and gossip as vehicles for comprehending the workings 
and intent of those in power. Since the passage of the 13th and 14th 
amendments rumours had filled the air — of how the Prime Minister 
proposes to tame the judiciary, how he plans to take control of the 
army, and how eventually he would circumscribe the press. None of it 
may have been true but the rumours were all there, causing anxieties 
and shaping attitudes. To many people in many places, the Chief 
Justice appeared to be standing up to an ominous trend. That 
explains the spontaneous and broad based support he elicited.
    
But rumours were not the only stimulants to anxiety over a trend 
toward concentration of power, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's 
overwhelming parliamentary majority permits him a nearly free hand 
to legislate, make rules and change the rules of government. Then 
came the anxiety-inducing legislation. Some objected to the 14th 
amendment on purist ground: any constriction put on legislators is a 
violation of their rights. Most people thought the purist position 
inappropriate in a country where so many elected representatives 
used their freedom of choice to go on the auction block. The 
majority welcomes the prohibition on lotabazi as a necessary 
deterrent. But then the government added to it a blanket prohibition 
on dissent itself. The Court had no choice but to throw the baby out 
with the bath water.
    
Similarly, the anti-terrorist law was legislated despite an informed 
consensus against it. The Prime Minister appears convinced that it 
has effectively ended sectarian violence in Pakistan. That is not 
true and his advisors ought to tell him so. Moreover, it is a bad 
policeman's law. Its provisions too are unlikely to win judicial 
approval. The Prime Minister should realize this lest an 
unfavourable ruling cause another rift with the judiciary. True, the 
parliament is the supreme legislative body. But true also, that the 
judiciary has the ultimate authority to rule on the 
constitutionality of laws.
    
If the right lessons are drawn from this event, great good will have 
come out of a bad situation. The weeks past revealed a polity 
stronger and more lively than most observers had imagined. The 
President avoided partisanship and played a quiet, moderating role. 
The Court stood its ground and has reinforced the principle of 
separation of powers. In doing so it had the active support of the 
institutions of civil society — the bar associations, the press, and 
the intelligentsia as a whole. Above all, the Prime Minister finally 
acted wisely. To him goes the ultimate credit of defusing a crisis 
that could have caused great damage to the country. Those who 
describe the conclusion of this crisis as Nawaz Sharif's defeat are 
medieval 'pahalwans'. They do not know what democracy is about, nor 
what modernity entails.

<a name="what">What is milk?</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

MS. AMINA JILANI writing in her Jaywalker column (Dawn magazine 
October 26) was in top form. Responding to a letter published in 
this newspaper about a traffic accident that led to the death of two 
young girls by a car driven at high speed by a driver allegedly 
inebriated, she laments the fact that this particular incident went 
unreported by the newspapers and wonders why.
    
She writes: "The crash allegedly took place in the early hours of a 
Sunday morning. Now, our newspapers, including this one, publish 
regular reports on car accidents in the city particularly when 
anybody involved have been killed. In that Sunday's two Karachi 
papers, it was reported that a motorcyclist was knocked down and 
killed by a water tanker and pedestrian killed by a hit and run 
vehicle. No mention of the two dead girls. On Monday it was reported 
that two men were killed in an accident between a taxi and a minibus 
and another man killed when a coach turned turtle. No mention again 
of the two girls."
    
This omission baffles her but only momentarily for she goes on to 
raise some serious questions. Those in the car that killed the two 
young girls were obviously well-connected. She asks what sort of 
children are being raised, what sort of education are they being 
given at home and at school. Writes Ms Jilani: "The two boys in 
question, "A" level students in one of Karachi's elite moneyed 
breed, to the best of our knowledge have received no punishment, no 
censure, they have merely picked up from where they left off."
    
I share Ms Jilani's concern though it is not easy to provide her 
with the answers. It is all a matter of perception. When a poor boy 
steals oranges from an orchard, he is a thief. When a rich boy does 
the same, it is a bit of a lark. I can do no better than bring in 
the Hungarian born British writer George Mikes, best known for his 
book How to be an Alien. In another book, he recalls an old story 
which is about explaining something very difficult to understand.  A 
blind man asks a young girl what milk is. The girl is astonished 
that someone can be so foolish that he doesn't know what milk is." 
Milk is white," she tells him. The old man tells her that he is 
blind and he doesn't know what white means. The girl tells him that 
it is easy to explain, and tells him that a swan is white. The old 
man tells her that a swan may be white but he has never seen a swan. 
"It has a curved neck," she tells him. The blind man says that he 
has no idea what "curved" is. The girl lifts her arm, bends her 
wrists forward like a swan's neck." "Feel it," she says. "That's 
curved." The old man feels the girl's arm, touches the curved wrist 
and exclaims joyfully: "Thank God. Now at last I know what milk is."
    
We all have our own ways of defining terms. When we say, as we are 
inclined to say ad nauseum, that the law must apply to all equally, 
we do not have ourselves in mind. It is a fact of life that the poor 
and the wretched of this world, the meek (who are destined to 
inherit the world which has always seemed to me a post-dated cheque 
on a crashing bank) are twice penalised. Once for the simple fact of 
being poor and then again for being victimised because they are 
poor.
    
The yard-stick we apply in dispensing justice differs. Take just the 
fact that even in our jails, a class system operates. We have A, B, 
and C class prisoners and these are awarded not by the nature of the 
crime but by social classification. Thus we will find that a lowly 
pickpocket will be lodged in C class while a rich and powerfully 
connected serial killer will be in A class. This is an elementary 
example but it goes to the core of the problem of law enforcement.
    
So long as there are exceptions, the system of law-enforcement as 
such will be flawed. I have always maintained that the law should be 
perceived as the protector of the people and by that token the law-
enforcer should be seen as a friend. The reverse is true. The common 
man, if I may refer to the majority of the population in so rustic a 
fashion, has no confidence in the judicial system and the 
relationship with the law-enforcer is an adversarial one.
    
My idea of a just society would be when any man, woman or child can 
walk into a police thana without fear, without feeling intimidated. 
He or she should walk in seeking help and support and made to feel 
that they will get it, without a price tag.
    
As to what sort of education the moneyed breed are getting in elite 
homes and schools, I cannot really say. But what I can say with 
certainty is that the majority of the children in this country are 
getting no education at all. We would need someone like George Mikes 
to tell these children what schools look like.
    
I hope the above addresses some of the concerns of Ms Amina Jilani 
and others like her who tilt at windmills. It's the best that I can 
do. I entirely agree with the American visitor who said that the 
future is "Scary, man real scary."

<a name="fais">Faisalabad fiasco and quadrangular</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

Stunning defeat in the decisive third and final Test against South 
Africa at Faisalabad where Pakistan were decimated and were bowled 
out for 92 while chasing a marginal target of 146 to win with all 
the time in the world may not have come as a rude shock as much for 
the players as it was for hundreds and thousands of people at home 
and abroad who were glued to their television sets anticipating a 
series win for Pakistan after they had dominated the Test for almost 
three days out of three and a half. The manner of self-inflicted 
distruction was such that it once again makes the mind wander 
triggering signals of suspicion which are associated with the modern 
day game.

A defeat at Christchurch two years ago in the final Test after 
Pakistan had won two Tests on the trot and emphatically too, a 
massive 324 runs beating at Johannesburg against South Africa in the 
one-off Test and then an innings defeat at Harare against Zimbabwe 
only a few days later which sparked the fixing and bribery 
controversy found an echo after the defeat at Faisalabad. Without 
casting aspersions on the team which somehow failed to come to the 
expectations of the cricket loving public and in no way denying the 
merits of the respected visitors excellence, it is common knowledge 
that outside elements have their own axe to grind.
    
Even in normal circumstances Pakistan is known to have flunked. They 
floundered at Headingley in the early seventies in Australia a 
couple of times and in the West Indies too but then we only had 
stars and no team, individuals with diverse interest and angles with 
an eye on self projection. That is why Pakistan could manage to win 
only one Test series overseas and that too against New Zealand in 
the late seventies. Therefore it is nothing new really that Pakistan 
has once again let a golden moment slip. There may not have been 
something fishy in that but the way our players threw away their 
wickets and failed to rise to the occasion was quite embarrassing, 
to say the least. For this debacle the people who trained boys were 
also to blame.
    
Surely the humiliating defeat in the third Test has now come to them 
as a rude awakening. Chopping and changing the team every now and 
then has brought little and no result. It has unsettled a team which 
has started to emerge alongside the best. Now that they will be 
faced with the best like Sri Lanka, South Africa and West Indies in 
the one-day quadrangular they will be once again with a new captain 
and a changed side. That will not do them any good unless they 
really play to their full potential which they seldom do.

<a name="akra">Akram delighted with Anwar, Sohail's knocks</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 3: Pakistan captain Wasim Akram was delighted not only 
because Pakistan beat the West Indies by eight wickets but two of 
his frontline batsmen were back in form.
    
"Winning is always great and it's needed more frequently. But what 
is more important is the fact that Saeed Anwar and Aamir Sohail were 
back in form," Akram said from Lahore.
    
"I always had confidence in both the players, specially Saeed Anwar. 
He (Saeed Anwar) was through a rough period but I am glad that with 
sheer determination, he is back to his old ways," Akram, who has 
taken over the charge from Anwar, said.
    
Akram maintained that as a leader it was his moral duty to support 
his key player. "Saeed Anwar has done for the team in the last three 
years or so more than anyone else has done. But this was the period 
when he wanted someone to boost his morale."
    
Saeed Anwar's 108 not out was his first century in 11 matches. He 
now becomes the second leading century-maker after Desmond Haynes of 
West Indies who has 17. Indian skipper Sachin Tendulkar has 12 
centuries.
 
"Aamir Sohail had been struggling with the bat as well as off-the-
field. But now he has sorted out all his problems and it is great 
that he should now be looking forward to perform even better," Akram 
said.

<a name="exit">Pakistan's exit debases cricket carnival</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Zafar Samdani

LAHORE, Nov 7: Soaring carnival spirits were somewhat deflated as 
Pakistan crashed out of the Golden Jubilee Quadrangular Tournament 
on Wednesday, but Lahore is still a city living by cricket.
    
The question uppermost in everyone's mind till the national team's 
exit from the eight day cricket-vaganza — this is how the Pakistan 
Cricket Board billed the event — was: what are Pakistan's chances of 
winning?
    
Inevitably, the team was rated high, with sentiment prevailing over 
ground facts. The track performance of participants suggested Sri 
Lanka leading the quartet and South Africa about one-fourth of a 
length behind but expected to produce a burst of speed in the home 
stretch.
    
Clandestine gambling operations offered a miserly rate for the 
islanders and no lucrative bargain for backing the springboks. The 
West Indians, trailing the field by a distance, could be backed at 
long odds. Pakistan's position kept fluctuating with the bookies but 
never was the team installed as favourites.
    
Mobiles have been incessantly bleeping in five-star lobbies. An ear 
to the small instrument and a hand on the driving wheel is no 
unusual sight in Lahore, but it has been more on show in the last 
few days than ever before, presumably because of heavy betting on 
the quadrangular matches.
    
Not just on results. Information on the grapevine suggests that 
millions would be staked on the toss tomorrow (Saturday) when the 
coin is flung in the air. Batting first, everyone agrees, places a 
team in the driving seat.
    
Sri Lankans were the hot favourites from the start, but the South 
African win on Thursday has made the final more of an open contest 
even though the islanders batted without Jayasuriya and two of their 
key bowlers. But then South Africa also rested paceman Donald.
    
The finalists appear well equipped for overcoming odds which makes 
the match anybody's game, the Sri Lankans remain ahead in most 
people's contention. A full house is expected.
    
If it has been a week of hectic calculations for punters, genuine 
followers of the sport were also served a stroke-full feast of 
cricket. Spectators shouted, roared, banged plastic bottles and beat 
drums with every delivery. They were only disappointed by dot balls.
    
They came to the matches with the fullest preparation for a picnic, 
not that there is a dearth of eatables in the stands which leave the 
stadium in a sorry, garbage-filled state much before the end of 
play. Sandwich baskets, coffee flasks and fruit are brought by most 
families in the more expensive enclosures while in the general and 
women's enclosures, traditional homemade food is mostly the menu.
    
The city is flooded with cricket-related banners which inundate the 
scene around the venue. Inside the Qadhafi Stadium, young men with 
their faces painted, drooled up girls, older people getting into the 
mood, wave flags.
    
With strict security arrangement setting up a formidable buffer 
between players and cricket enthusiasts and the teams hotel not 
easily accessible to all, cricketers have reliable protection from 
excessive attention of cricket-mad crowds. Determined admirers 
nevertheless find a way of reaching them.
    
Or other personalities converging on the provincial capital for 
professional or cricket interests. At the final, practically every 
past and present Pakistani cricketer of note is expected to be 
present.
    
Always hospitable, most citizens are in an unprecedentedly generous 
mood. Sunil Gavaskar should be able to drive away a Pajero of his 
preference and no bills presented. Henry Blofeld could ask for 
royalty from shops selling artificial jewellry. His Sharjah 
originated focus on earrings has reportedly upped their sales. Among 
those who may not recognise Geoffrey Boycott, he has just to 
pronounce an 'o' to find out how much more following his insight 
into the sport may have won him in our part of the world than his 
prowess with the willow had earns when he toured the country as a 
cricketer.
    
This is not to say that foreigners and locals, commentators, experts 
and cricketers not mentioned here haven't made an impact. None more 
than Jonty Rhodes. The tournament's participants included many a 
famous cricketer. But it is his athletic feats in the field, plus an 
ever smiling and clapping presence that have made him the most 
popular cricketer of the tournament.

<a name="exci">Exciting final awaits cricket fans</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, Nov 7: An exciting competition will be witnessed in final of 
the Golden Jubilee Quadrangular Floodlit Cricket Tournament between 
two evenly-balanced sides of South Africa and Sri Lanka at the 
Qadhafi Stadium on Saturday.
     
It has been reliably learnt that Sri Lanka management would play the 
same team which beat the West Indies and Pakistan sides during 
league matches in this tournament.
     
In a strange move, the Sri Lanka team has planned to open the 
bowling attack with a spinner. More interesting is the strategy to 
open the bowling with off-spinner Aravinda de Silva. It will be 
something amusing to see whether the plan of an off-spinner 
operating with the new ball succeeds or not. No doubt, the strong 
South African side is considered to be rather weak while playing the 
quality spin-bowling, but during the Test series against Pakistan 
and in this tournament, South African batsmen have been competently 
handling the spin bowling. That is why  the South African side has 
unbeaten record in  this competition. No one should be surprised if 
the South African team maintains its unblemished record and wins the 
tournament. But the Sri Lanka side is no "push-over"!
     
Winning of toss has played very important role in this tournament. 
Team winning the toss likes to put the other side in to bat as it 
wants to avoid to bowl and field in the evening when dew makes 
gripping of ball by bowlers and catching or stopping the ball by 
fielders very difficult. However, South Africa is the only side 
which won two matches of the competition bowling in the evening. It 
had registered wins against Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
     
The pitch looks full of runs. Most of the fans lost interest in the 
tournament after the ouster of Pakistan. The hard-fought last league 
match between South Africa and Sri Lanka was a very poorly-attended 
show despite the fact that game of the highest order was on display. 
But the final is expected to draw reasonable number of cricket-
lovers. Many concessions have been announced by Pakistan Cricket 
Board (PCB) in tickets. That should also have a good effect on 
attendance in the final.
     
South Africa 'on-the-tour' management committee had a meeting late 
on Friday evening and finalised the team for the all-important match 
of the tournament. Paceman Alan Donald has been brought into the 
side in place of the  diminutive, unorthodox left-arm spinner Paul 
Adams. All the other players of the team which beat Sri Lanka on

<a name="firs">First phase of Pakistan's ascendancy in Squash-I</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

Squash and Pakistan have virtually become synonymous. No other 
nation in the world has in its fifty years history earned so much 
international glory and honour by dint of its unique record and 
unparalleled achievements in the realm of sports.
    
Whether in the British Open or World Open or at the Asian level, the 
country has maintained its grip not only on the courts but in the 
councils too. The foundation of the Asian Squash Federation as well 
as the Professional Squash Players Association (ISPA) — later re-
named as the Professional Squash Association (PSA) — owed a great 
deal to Pakistan.
    
While celebrating its golden jubilees the country remembers with 
pride the world renowned sportsmen particularly in squash, who kept 
its flag flying high in several continents and all corners of the 
globe.
    
Living legend Hashim Khan, born 81 years ago in 1916 in Nawakille, a 
village near Peshawar (NWFP) in the British ruled India, is rightly 
called the Baba-i-Squash (Father of modern squash) for its was he 
who put Pakistan for the first time on the map of world squash.
    
Serving in the Pakistan Air Force, before serving as a ball boy in 
the Peshawar Club's uncovered cemented courts where the British 
officers used to play squash, Hashim Khan learnt his game the hard 
way. With the passage of time he improved his technique and mastery. 
He demonstrated his power in the Western India championship winning 
the title three years in a row (1944, 1945, 1946) at the age of 28 
beating Abdul Bari before returning to his native city Peshawar 
after the partition of India in 1947.
    
For almost six years there was no squash organisation in the country 
at the national level. Jalil Qureshi, a former national amateur 
champion, took the initiative in forming the Pakistan Squash Rackets 
Federation in Karachi in 1954. It was milestone in Pakistan's squash 
history. The Federation has alternately been patronised and promoted 
by the Pakistan Navy and the Pakistan Air Force.
    
Hashim Khan, now living in the United States brought the first 
international glory to Pakistan in 1951 by ending the Egyptian 
ascendancy when he outplayed Mahmood al-Karim in straight games in 
the prestigious British Open, then regarded as the unofficial world 
championship. It was a professional event but the amateurs also did 
compete in the tournament. Winning the British Open at the age of 36 
was a great feat indeed. He subsequently went on to establish a new 
record of seven victories in the British Open (1951 - 56 and 1958.) 
besides six successive wins (1978-83) after the event was instituted 
in 1976.
    
Hashim, Roshan, Azam and Mohibullah Senior — all the great Khans 
hailing from NWFP — together ruled the international squash for an 
unprecedented 13 years, winning 13 British Open titles in a row, 
besides winning many other tournaments in Australia, Canada, USA, 
Egypt, Scotland and other places.
    
The Pakistan Air Force not only helped Hashim Khan to earn honours 
and glories for Pakistan, but also built a modern squash complex — 
Hashim Khan Squash Complex — at Peshawar in recognition of the 
legendary champion's services to national squash.
    
Hashim's younger brother Azam Khan and Mohibullah Khan all were in 
PAF who later took foreign coaching assignments. Hashim and 
Mohibullah settled in USA and Azam in London after Pakistan's 
domination in professional squash went through an eclipse in 1963.
    
Roshan Khan, one of the finest stroke players the world has seen, 
performed a remarkable feat by beating the then uncrowned squash 
king Hashim Khan in the 1957 British Open Final.
    
Roshan Khan had, however, to struggle hard to prove hat he was 
equally good but lacked required support and incentive which later 
came from Pakistan Navy which helped him prove his capabilities and 
calibre. Before the British Open victory Roshan Khan had beaten 
Hashim in the Pakistan Professionals Squash Championship Final held 
in 1956 at the Karachi Parsi Institute Squash Court.
    
The Karachi victory further highlighted Roshan Khan's position as 
one of the world's leading squash stars. He won the 1956 Dunlop 
Professional Championship final one though losing his teeth in the 
bargain. Like a wounded tiger he fought back to claim the title and 
then proceeded to win a number of international tournaments.
    
Azam Khan also demonstrated his squash power by wining the Britain 
Open four times in a row (1959-62) and several other international 
tournaments. The last member of the great Khan clan was Mohibullah 
Sr who won the 1963 British Open but thereafter Pakistan's first 
golden squash era ended.
    
Aftab Javed, Gogi Alauddin, Mohammed Yasin and Mohibullah Khan 
Junior, Qamar Zaman all did their best to recapture Pakistan's 
supremacy in the British Open but could not fully succeed. Aftab 
Javed thrice reached the British Open finals losing to Egypt's Abu 
Talib, Australia's G. Hunt and Ireland's Jonah Barrington 
respectively in 1966,67,71.
    
Gogi Alauddin, called the master of the lob; twice entered the 
British Open finals but lost to Barrington in 1973 and was beaten by 
Qamar Zaman in the 1975 final.
    
Mohammad Yasin, too, entered the 1974 British Open final but gave a 
walkover to Hunt of Australia because of the injury he sustained 
though he surprised defending champion Barrington in the semi-final.
    
Mohibullah Junior reached the 1979 British Open final but was beaten 
by Hunt. Qamar was the only player of the post Khans era, to reach 
the British Open finals three times (1978-80) more but each time he 
lost to Hunt who surpassed Khan's record of seven wins in 1981.

<a name="worl">World squash championship wide open</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 3: the non-participation of Pakistan's Jansher 
Khan, eight times the winner and holder, creates the inevitable 
situation of a new champion of the World Open Squash Championship 
being crowned here on Saturday. The tournament begins tomorrow.
    
In order of seeding, the main contenders for the vacant title are 
Rodney Eyles, the 30-year-old Australian, who was the losing 
finalist in Karachi last year, Peter Nicol, of Scotland, semi-
finalist in 1994 and 1996, and Canadian Jonathon Power, the most 
improved player over the last two years.
    
On the basis of results this season, Eyles is not a likely champion. 
Only once in six tournaments since June has he progressed beyond the 
quarter-finals stage.
    
In view of Nicol's performances against Jansher, the Scot must be 
fancied. He stretched him to the full distance in the British Open, 
in April, and beat him twice afterwards, in the Al-Ahram Tournament, 
in Cairo in June, and in the final of the Kuwait Open, a fortnight 
ago.
    
On the other hand, Nicol has twice lost to Power. indeed he is 
fortunate that Power is drawn in the opposite half. Seedings 
indicate that England's Simon is Nicol's main rival for a semi-
finals place.
    
However, Nicol has more to fear from Ahmed Barada, of Egypt. Indeed, 
he beat him in the Al ahram Tournament, but only after a long and 
fractious match in which Barada's tactics were so wickedly physical 
and unfair that he was reprimanded and fined by the Professional 
Squash Association.

<a name="amja">Amjad loses to Power in world squash</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 6: For the first time since the World Squash 
Championship was instituted in 1976, Pakistan are unrepresented at 
the quarter-finals stage. her last survivor, qualifier Amjad Khan, 
found himself too inexperienced to cope with the speed and brilliant 
racket work of Canada's Jonathon Power, one of the three contenders 
most likely to succeed Amjad's illustrious uncle, Jansher Khan, as 
World champion.
    
Power beat Amjad in only 35 minutes, 15-9, 15-6, 15-4. The Pakistani 
youngster had come through to the second round by upsetting the 16th 
seeded Irishman, Dcrek Ryan, yesterday.
