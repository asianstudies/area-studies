-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 12: A man was killed and three others were injured on 
Wednesday when a hand grenade was lobbed into an audio cassette shop in Lea 
Market.
 
The deceased Faqir Muhammad, was an employee at the Nisar Music Centre who 
had been running the shop for the last 12 years. The injured were Sajid 
Hussain, and his nephew Nadir who had come to the shop to buy cassettes.
    
They were taken to the Civil hospital where both were stated to be safe. 
Hanif, the third victim, was a worker at the shop, but did not need 
hospital treatment. A son of the shop owner, Imran, told Dawn that Faqir 
Muhammad was standing at the counter and he himself and his brother Nisar 
and worker Hanif were serving the customers when the blast occurred. 
According to an official handout it was caused by a Russian-made grenade.
    
Haji Siddique, who is engaged in a legal battle with his shops landlord, 
told Dawn that he was sitting in his office when the blast occurred. I 
have no enmity with anybody, he asserted. However, eye-witnesses told Dawn 
that Haji Siddiquis son, Nisar, had had an altercation in the morning with 
an Afghani quack who sold herbs at the footpath near his shop. The Afghani 
had allegedly teased a Baloch woman who complained against him to Nisar and 
this led to an exchange of hot words between them, they added. 
    
Police officials believe that personal enmity might be the motive behind 
the incident.
   
Bomb disposal squad chief told Dawn that the explosive device was a Freg-1 
handgrenade weighing about one pound.

<a name="nola">No law yet to enforce ban on marriage feasts, fireworks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Intikhab Hanif

LAHORE, March 14: No official in the Punjab government was aware till late 
on Friday night that under which law the recently imposed ban on feasts, 
illumination, fireworks display and firing on marriages was going to be 
enforced from Sunday.

The situation was confusing for police and district administration in 
Lahore and elsewhere as they did not know how and under what law they were 
required to take cognizance of the violations of the ban. Some even said 
they did not know which department would be enforcing the ban.

A ban on arranging feasts on marriages and related ceremonies was announced 
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in his televised address to the nation. The 
federal cabinet had on March 6 approved a draft of the proposed law under 
which the ban was to be enforced.

It was reportedly announced in the briefing about the cabinet meeting that 
fines ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 300,000 would be imposed on violations 
of the ban. But it was not clarified who would take notice of the violation 
and how.

A senior official confirmed that the provincial government had not as yet 
formulated any new law for the enforcement of the ban.

He said as it would be a uniform ban all over the country the relevant law 
would be announced by the federal government most probably on Saturday. I 
am told that summary of the law has been moved but I dont know whether it 
would be introduced through an ordinance or some other means, he said.

When asked to explain what he meant by other means, he said ban on lavish 
marriage parties had also been imposed in the country in the past and it 
is yet to be seen whether law about it does exist and the government is 
going to invoke it, or not.

He said he had also heard that it was the Food Department which would be 
asked to ensure holding of simple marriage ceremonies, admitting that 
basically it was the job of police and magistracy to take cognizance of 
violations of a law.

Lahore deputy commissioner said there had been no notification of the law 
but we have already been instructed to enforce the ban and take prime 
ministers maiden address as orders.

<a name="sche">Scheme evolved by India, China may be adopted</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Umashanker Phadnis

NEW DELHI, March 13: At their three-day meeting beginning here on March 28, 
the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan are likely to explore the 
possibility of the two countries adopting the modality and mechanism 
evolved by India and China to foster confidence-building measures between 
them.
    
In the case of Sino-Indian relations, after several rounds of talks solely 
on the boundary question had proved fruitless, the two countries decided to 
work on building an atmosphere of trust and confidence in each other before 
coming to grips with the nitty-gritty of the boundary problem.
    
Accordingly, a number of working groups, consisting of foreign office 
representatives and experts, were set up to come up with measures for co-
operation between the two countries in mutually agreed areas. As a result 
of the exertions of these bodies, there has been over the past few years a 
marked improvement in trade exchanges between the two countries, not only 
through the formal channels but also across borders between Tibet and the 
adjoining Indian territories, which had abruptly ceased because of tension 
along the borders. 
   
This apart, at the military level, the two sides were able to devise 
measures to avoid eyeball- to- eyeball confrontation and also take 
appropriate measures to prevent incidents of firing across the borders.
    
There are a number of measures in the case of Indo-Pakistan relations which 
the two governments can take and which would be in consonance with 
overwhelming public desire on both sides , but remain to be implemented 
partly because of bureaucratic hassles and diplomatic misgivings. Among 
these, perhaps the most urgent relate to travel procedures which have 
become so time consuming and cumbersome that the general public in both 
countries would like to see ended.
    
Besides this, of late there has been a growing awareness in the commercial 
and trade communities in both countries of the immense advantages of a more 
relaxed regime for commercial exchanges. He has also indicated that these 
would be announced on the eve of the meeting he will have with his 
counterpart, Gohar Ayub Khan, when he visits here for the SAARC foreign 
ministers meeting.

<a name="bena">Benazir decides to quit power politics</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, March 11: The chairperson of PPP, Ms Benazir Bhutto, declared that 
she had played her role in politics and now she was not aspiring to return 
to power or work as opposition leader in the National Assembly. She urged 
the party to choose an alternative leadership.
    
Answering reporters, she said at present the PPP was not agreeing to her 
point of view. However, she said she would again try to persuade the party 
leaders.
    
She was asked to comment on the Press reports that she had told her party 
leadership that she was not aspiring to become prime minister once again 
although power was regarded as natural dream of every politician.
    
I am not disappointed. But I am also not power-hungry, the PPP 
chairperson said. She claimed that she was not ready to join politics at 
all but the 1977 situation forced her to set her foot in this field. She 
said now that she had been prime minister of Pakistan for two terms and had 
done quite a few things for the development of the country, she was no 
longer an aspirant for the top slot. She refused to name the PPP leader who 
could replace her in the party or in parliament. I dont want to breathe 
down the next leader. I dont know who will win the hearts of the people.
    
The PPP chairperson said it had become a fashion in Pakistan that with the 
installation of every government in power, the opposition parties launched 
their efforts to pull it down. But, she said, she was making a departure 
from this practice and would like to give Mr Sharif time to work and give 
the people some breathing space.
    
She answered in the negative when a reporter asked the possibility of her 
leaving the country along with her children or striking a deal with the 
present government to seek the release of her husband Asif Zardari. 
Question does not rise.
    
The former prime minister said she did not believe in politics of deals. 
Ill rather prefer death to deals, she said, recalling that the Bhuttos 
had always belied such assertions and their past bore testimony to this 
effect. She said she believed that Allah would accept her prayers about the 
release of her husband and the latter would get justice along with other 
innocent people under arrest.
    
She said so far Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had not taken any step against 
her family which could be taken as victimisation or an indication that the 
new government did not want a working relationship with the opposition. As 
for the possibility of her going abroad, the PPP chairperson said, she 
might take her children to the United States, London or to Saudi Arabia to 
perform Umra during the summer vacation. But, she said, there was nothing 
wrong in such excursions during vacations as other political leaders had 
also been undertaking such visits. However, she said she was feeling that a 
long time had gone by since she last went to jail in 1986. Jail is not a 
bad place. In jail one gets a lot of time for worship.
    
But when a reporter asked her if she apprehended her arrest, the PPP 
chairperson answered in the negative. However, she hastened to add that 
President Farooq Leghari had become Farooqul Haq, nothing could be ruled 
out. Ms Bhutto described Ziaul Haq and Farooq Leghari as two sides of the 
same coin.
    
Replying to a question about the February 3 elections, the PPP chairperson 
alleged that ballot boxes had been stuffed and the turnout was not 40 per 
cent, as claimed by the Election Commission of Pakistan.
    
The PPP chairperson pointed out that all international observers were of 
the view that the turnout ranged between 15 and 18 percent. She claimed 
that all those who had cast their votes in elections were the PPP 
supporters. She admitted that some communication weaknesses of the party 
were also responsible for the PPPs defeat in elections. She said the urban 
people held the PPP responsible for the price hike but the party could not 
properly convey its point of view to them. Similarly, she said, the people 
were also influenced by corruption charges against her government, some of 
which might be right and some wrong.
    
Ms Bhutto said some man of conscience would ultimately emerge to reveal how 
the ballot boxes had been stuffed in the 1997 elections.
    
Answering a question about the outgoing Punjab governor Khwaja Tariq Rahim, 
Ms Bhutto said he had always been President Legharis man and his fixer. 
She, however, admitted that Mr Rahim was always honest in his dealings with 
her. She said she did not know whether Mr Rahim wanted to join the PPP.

<a name="retu">Returning Pakistanis being harassed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Saghir Ahmed 

KARACHI, March 8: The re-introduction of green channel facility at 
airports has come as a windfall to many and a hell to some returning 
Pakistanis from abroad, particularly from Gulf States.
    
Such a situation has arisen due to what observers termed unauthorised 
interception and harassment of the passengers en route their homes by a 
number of other law enforcement agencies soon after coming out of the 
customs channel.
    
The green channel facility was re-introduced by the Prime Minister Mian 
Nawaz Sharif soon after taking over the reigns of the government some time 
in February 1997, apparently, in response to public demands.
    
Inquiries show that the Preventive Collectorate of Customs had been 
following the Central Board of Revenues (CBR) directive issued soon after 
the announcement by the Prime Minister, allowing the free use of the green 
channel facility, directing Customs staff not to interfere in any manner 
with the arriving passengers.
    
The CBR chief has also dispensed with the powers of the custom officers 
regarding 5 per cent random checking of arriving passengers, apparently, on 
the directive of the Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
    
The interesting aspect of the whole episode is that the Customs have the 
inherent powers of anti-smuggling under the Customs Act of 1969 whereas 
other agencies which have let loose a reign of terror among bona fide 
returning Pakistanis, have only the delegated powers. Inquiries also show 
that in some cases, some of the law enforcement agencies have just no 
powers to intercept or search any person or his baggage within the 
municipal limit of a town or city.
    
In spite of this, some of the law enforcement agencies, especially the 
Police and its mobile pick ups, go on checking the arriving passengers in 
gross violation of the PMs directive that is acting contrary to 
established practices.
    
Inquiries depict that where the authority of the officials of these 
agencies had been challenged or where they have failed to achieve their 
ulterior motives, the passengers even if they are accompanied by their 
family members, have been heckled and in some cases they have been booked 
on count of smuggling under the relevant laws as per reports.
    
As a matter of legal procedure, these agencies, especially the police 
officials, have to lodge such cases (FIRs) in the court of Special Judge 
(Customs and Taxation) for trial of the person and refer the same to the 
Custom House for holding of quasi-judicial proceedings i.e. for purposes of 
the impugned goods to the Preventive Collectorate for adjudication plus 
penalty to the passenger. Both these proceedings (criminal and 
adjudication) go separately under the law and have no impact on one 
another.
    
Inquiries show that no case of smuggling of goodscleared by the Customs 
through the green channel at the Quaid-i-Azam airport has so far been 
referred for adjudication purposes to the Custom House. This shows that not 
all such cases have either been registered by any of the agencies or had 
been kept pending for further investigation or may have been disposed of-
unheard. It is anybodys guess!

<a name="voti">Voting right granted to overseas Pakistanis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, March 9: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif issued instructions to the 
Chief Election Commissioner to take necessary steps to give the overseas 
Pakistanis the right to cast vote in elections in their homeland.
    
The main objective behind the step is to enable them to play their role in 
choosing representatives to run the country.
    
There are some 3.5 million Pakistan who are working in other countries who 
would be benefited by the decision. Press Assistant to the prime minister, 
Mr Siddiqul Farooq told reporters that Mian Nawaz Sharif regarded denying 
the overseas Pakistanis right to cast their vote in elections in their 
motherland violative of the Constitution and the law.
    
The prime minister, he said, thought that with the conferment of this 
right, the involvement of Pakistanis working in other countries in their 
own country would go up.
    
The Supreme Court has already asked for this right to the overseas 
Pakistanis and it is also enshrined in the  PML manifesto. The prime 
minister has also directed the relevant authorities to ensure that all 
business centres and private institutions remained closed from 1pm to 3pm 
on Fridays.
    
Mr Sharif feels that many organisations continued their business during 
these hours owing to which the purpose of declaring Friday as half day was 
defeated. With Friday being a working day, the spokesman quoted the prime 
minister as saying, the gatherings in mosques had swelled and the day was 
no longer being wasted in social functions.
    
The prime minister has made it clear that he wanted to see his instructions 
implemented in letter and spirit.
    
Mr Sharif would soon start meeting the people desirous of personally 
handing over cash or cheques to the prime minister for his debt-retirement 
scheme. Such people would be required to inform the prime minister of their 
desire on Islamabads Fax No: 9201545.  They would be informed about the 
day and time of their meeting with the prime minister.
    
It has been decided that the prime minister will meet such people daily 
from 9.00am to 9.30am. The date from which these meetings start will be 
notified subsequently.
    
The prime minister has issued another directive to the Education Ministry 
that in villages where schools are without buildings, mosques should be 
used as teaching centres till Zohr prayers.
    
The  education secretary has been asked to  prepare  a comprehensive plan 
for the purpose. The prime ministers spokesman said that the plan would 
help raise the literacy rate without burdening the exchequer.

<a name="more">More relaxation in immigration rules likely</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 11: The authorities are actively considering a proposal to 
relax the immigration rules for overseas Pakistanis on their arrival in the 
country. Sources said a proposal to withdraw the immigration process for 
Pakistanis, including for those having dual nationality, upon their arrival 
in the country, was under consideration.
    
The incoming Pakistanis would no more be required to have their arrival 
stamped on their passports after the proposal had been approved.
   
At present, all incoming passengers, including ex-pat Pakistanis, are 
required to get their entry stamped on their passports by the FIA 
immigration staff. In his first term, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, had 
withdrawn the restriction of entry stamps for overseas Pakistanis, but it 
was reimposed by the previous PPP government. Earlier, the visa restriction 
for Pakistanis holding dual nationality was withdrawn by the PML 
government.
   
The present move to relax the visa restrictions for Pakistanis holding dual 
nationality and further relaxing the immigration rules for overseas ex-pat 
Pakistanis is apparently aimed at boosting their confidence in the present 
government which has been seeking their help in reviving the countrys 
economy.

<a name="usjo">US journal sees flaw in Clinton policy towards Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, March 12: The Brown Amendment was bought and paid for by heavy 
Pakistani-American political donations but has yet to provide a single 
tangible economic benefit to Pakistan, the influential Wall Street Journal 
said on Tuesday.
    
The Clinton administrations first-term policy effort aimed at improving 
relations with Pakistan, the strategic nuclear-capable Muslim state, has 
fallen flat, the paper said.
    
The article was written by Mansoor Ijaz, a Pakistani-American investment 
tycoon running a multi-billion dollar money management firm, who also wrote 
a number of hard-hitting articles against the Benazir Bhutto government, 
exposing its corruption and incompetence last year. His remarks about 
heavy Pakistani donations to get the Brown Amendment passed could add a new 
dimension to the current congressional inquiries into Donorgate, the term 
being used for alleged sale of White House access and influence to mainly 
Asian donors by the Clinton administration.
    
These remarks on Pakistan were contained as part of the article which dealt 
with Washingtons handling of the Muslim World and the failure of the 
Clinton policy in South Asia.
    
The relevant part of the article on Pakistan said: The Clinton 
administrations first-term policy effort aimed at improving relations with 
this strategic nuclear-capable Muslim state fell flat. The vaunted Brown 
Amendment, sending embargoed military equipment back to Pakistan, was 
bought and paid for by heavy Pakistani-American political donations but has 
yet to provide a single tangible economic benefit for Pakistan. If engaged 
properly, Washingtons former Cold War ally could provide the strategic 
export route for Central Asian oil reserves. It could also provide a vital 
link in transporting natural gas from Omans vast gasfields to energy-
starved India. Yet, while political risk insurance and other protections 
for American investment remain blocked by American non-proliferation laws 
still in effect, Pakistan is busy creating other alliances, most notably 
with Beijing and Moscow. The implications of Pakistans 1995 (alleged) 
purchase of nuclear ring magnets from China just as it was asking American 
legislators to ease sanctions against it, and its recent purchase of tanks 
from the Ukraine, are among the clearest indications yet of the failure of 
US policy in South Asia.

If the US-backed World Bank funded a feasibility study for the proposed 
Oman-India natural gas pipeline, it might provide the needed impetus to 
build the pipeline overland through Iran and Pakistan - at half the cost of 
the deep-water route now contemplated. Such a move could bind the economic 
interests of Pakistan and India in a way that might finally encourage co-
operation on a wide array of sensitive issues, including Kashmir and 
nuclear proliferation, the article concluded.

<a name="elec">Electricity tariffs to go up by 100pc in five years</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin 

ISLAMABAD, March 13: The power tariffs, including hydel surcharge per kwh, 
is expected to increase from Rs2.24 in 1997 to Rs4.47 in the year 2002. 
This increase is estimated to be around 17.9 percent in 1997, peaking to 21 
percent in 1999 and then going down to 4.4 percent in the year 2002.
    
According to a study, Pakistans balance of payments position is estimated 
to worsen by 1.4 billion dollars in the year 2000-01 as a result of the 
payments due to the private power producers. In the current year, this 
burden is estimated to reach 391 million dollars. Cash outflows for 
purchasing private power are estimated to increase from Rs37 billion in 
1997 to Rs125 billion in 2002.
    
The percentage share of payments to be made for purchase of power in the 
total WAPDA revenue are estimated to go up from 37 percent in 1997 to 47 
percent in 2002.
    
With the economy growing at the rate of 5 percent per annum the country is 
likely to have surplus power of 19 MW in January 2002-03 and of 181MW in 
May of the same year. However, if the economy were to grow at the rate of 6 
percent per annum in year 2001-03 Pakistan will face power deficit of 1009 
MW in January. The deficit will come down to 837MW in May the same year. 
The surplus is expected to peak to 2253MW in January 1998-99 (at GDP GR of 
5 percent) and to 2269MW in May of the same year.
    
The above projection has been made on the basis of the financial closure 
achieved by 19 private power projects till date for generating electricity 
of 3454MW.

According to an official study, Bangladesh with a cost of investment index 
(CII) of 3.5 ranks first in a list of seven Asian countries evaluated for 
their ability to attract foreign investment. India follows closely behind 
with a CII of 3.8, Malaysia gets the third place with a CII of 6.6. Next is 
Pakistan with a CII of 7.1 followed by Philippines 9.8, Thailand 10.3 and 
Indonesia 12.
    
The study identifies cost of capital/interest rate on a project, cost of 
utilities and exemptions/holidays as three most important factors impacting 
on investment decision.
    
Pakistan lags far behind its South Asian colleagues in all these three 
elements.
    
The interest rate in Bangladesh is 15%; in India it is 16.50% and in 
Pakistan it is 23%. Telephone charges in Bangladesh (per 1000 calls) Takka 
42, in Pakistan Rs 50 and India (NA).
    
Rates of electricity in Bangladesh are (per 1000 Kwh) Takka 47 to 119; in 
India Rs 57 to Rs 84 and in Pakistan Rs 83 to Rs 112. Rates of water in 
Bangladesh (per million litre) are Takka 223, in India Rs 112 and in 
Pakistan Rs 373.
    
Rates of gas in Bangladesh (per 1000 cu.m) Taka 91, in India Rs 80 and in 
Pakistan Rs 100. There is 100% tax exemption for 100% export-oriented 
industries in Bangladesh and for spare parts the rates range between 2.5% 
to 7.5%, in India 100% tax exemptions for export-oriented industries in 
EPZs and for spare parts the rates are between 15-35% and in Pakistan there 
are no exemptions at all.
    
In Bangladesh new investments enjoy tax holidays for 5-7 years, in India 
the tax holiday is for 5 years for export-oriented industries, power 
projects in notified states and for 8 years in EPZs and in Pakistan no 
holidays except 3-8 years for agro-food projects and up to year 2000 for 
units in EPZs.
    
Being above other ASEAN countries like Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia 
is not much of a consolation because Pakistan would rank below these 
countries as well when factors such as availability of infrastructure, 
uninterrupted supply of utilities, disciplined and skilled labour force, 
quality of life and industrial culture are taken into consideration.
    
According to the study, with the rising demand for foreign investment by 
developing countries, Pakistan has to contend with a very competitive 
environment. Many of the Asian countries have opened their economies for 
foreign investment and are offering lucrative incentives and facilities.
    
These incentives range from:
    
1. Zero or reduced import duties on machinery and raw materials.
    
2. Exemption from levy of tax on income.
 
3. One window operation.
    
4. Fully developed infrastructure.
    
5. Uninterrupted supply of utilities.
    
6. A disciplined labour force.
    
7. Better quality of life.
    
These incentives provide a competitive edge and play a very important role 
when an investor decides to plan his investments in one country/market or 
the other.
    
It would take decades for Pakistan to make available to intending investors 
the facilities listed from number 4 to 7. Therefore, the study recommends 
that Pakistan make a more generous use of other incentives like tax 
concessions, exemptions and holidays.
    
However, the study views the ongoing structural reforms as envisaged in the 
IMF prescribed programmes coming in the way of a concession and incentive 
favouring foreign investment attracting policy. The study believes that the 
demand oriented economic reforms have affected the development efforts of 
countries like Pakistan where the major emphasis should be to increase 
output through structural reforms involving shift from agricultural base to 
industrial base.
    
The study attacked the IMF conditionalities for their bias for revenue 
generation at the cost of foreign investment flows. In the opinion of the 
authors of the study it is through more investment and increased production 
that revenue generation objectives could be fulfilled.
    
The study points out that the 1997-98 budget withdrew many of the 
concessions given to attract investment through incentive packages, which 
have resulted in increasing the cost of investing in Pakistan when compared 
to other Asian countries, especially India and Bangladesh.
    
Many leading foreign investors, especially in Japan and Korea where 
Pakistan held investment conferences, have strongly represented over these 
changes as these have affected their pipeline projects for investment, when 
they were at the stage of final decision making for their investment plans 
conceived and designed on the basis of the incentives packages marketed by 
Board of Investment of Pakistan all over the world.
    
They said that the anomalous tariff structure also impeded an increased 
flow of foreign direct investment. During the financial year 1994-95 while 
the government undertook to reduce import duties as a matter of policy, the 
duties on imported machinery and equipment were in effect increased. This 
upward trend was further augmented by levy of 10% regulatory duty in 
October, 1995. And in the current budget, increase in import duties on raw 
materials and reduction of duties on their finished products have made 
trading cheaper and manufacturing more costly.
    
The overall impact of this process on industrial development is quite 
adverse. It has, therefore, become even more profitable for foreign 
companies to set up their manufacturing facilities in some other Asian 
country and sell their goods in Pakistan through trading rather than 
establishing the manufacturing facility in Pakistan. In view of the above, 
the study has asked the new government to adjust the tariff and tax 
structure in such a way, while making the next years budget and trade 
policy, that the cost of manufacturing a product in Pakistan comes down in 
relation to the landed cost of importing the same product.
    
The study also advised that while negotiating with the IMF, the finance 
ministry alone should not be allowed to represent the interests of Pakistan 
government.
    
Organisations like the Board of Investment (BoI), which has been given the 
responsibility of selling Pakistan abroad as an ideal place for foreign 
direct investment, should also be permitted to argue the case from their 
perspective and try to convince the Fund to help attract more DFIs rather 
than curb their inflows with its demand curtailing conditionalities.

<a name="them">The missing factor in human resource development</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Haroon R. Siddiqi

THE CORPORATE sector in Pakistan, especially the multinational companies, 
has done away with the forced marriage of personnel and administration 
which are now two distinct functions, very much apart from each other. The 
industrial relations (IR) function has gradually assumed a predominant 
place in the industrial and commercial organisations.
    
The IR primarily owes its ascendancy to the promulgation of the West 
Pakistan Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance, 
1968 and the Industrial Relations Ordinance, 1969.The voluminous Labour 
Code which is considered the Bible of our industrial and commercial 
concerns has made the IR function an increasingly legal and intricate 
subject.
    
The myth of engaging a retired army officer for an administrative post who 
could handle personnel matters as trivialities does no longer prevail. 
Retired army personnel are normally good administrators but certainly lack 
the temperament and experience to manage the industrial/commercial 
workforce, as their defence orientation remains a major stumbling block.
    
The loss of uniform is a great setback to an army officer who finds himself 
severely enfeebled in civvies, which radically changes the milieu around 
him. It is a difficult experience for him to interact with an unruly labour 
force, unlike the disciplined army where the human characteristics and 
physiognomy are shaped through a single mould of command and obey.

Devout professionalism
    
Inspite of the devout professionalism in industrial relations, the concept 
of human resource development our corporate sector has never been put to 
work in its true sense, and this failure is not an exception with the 
multinational companies. What we have witnessed over the years is a kind of 
pseudo transformation that is nothing more than a facial treatment.
    
Most of the companies have restructured themselves and redesignated their 
personnel managers as managers human resources. Obviously the change in 
nomenclature is meaningless unless these men enlarge their vision and 
understanding of the new role which is unique in many ways. 
   
Their psyche, temperament, behaviour and other human faculties have to 
transmute for responding as catalysts in their organisational fraternities.
    
A manager human resources decidedly needs more qualities of heart as 
compared to head since he is dealing with an animate factor of production  
human beings.
    
It is fallacious to assume that efficient handling of the staff and 
employees routine matters is the principal job of the manager human 
resources. In fact, his core responsibility is to create a corporate 
culture and environment that would elicit the best talent and potential 
from the employed human resources towards meeting the corporate objectives. 
He must remain freely accessible to all with affability as the slightest 
taint of bureaucratic style will negate his purposeful existence in an 
organisation.
    
Many years back, I was attending a seminar where the speaker was 
articulately dwelling on the topic of Leadership Qualities. He introduced 
a number of western concepts, models & techniques for the benefit of the 
participants. Perhaps in the closing hours of the three-day seminar, some 
one quoted this verse from Allama Iqbal:
    
Nigah buland sukhan dilnawaz jan pur soz
    
Ye hee hai rakhte safar mir-e-karwan ke liye
    
Since I have some poetic interest and appreciation, I intently pondered on 
the profound message and realised that the entire seminar could not convey 
to me what Allamas though provoking verse had taught me in no time. Do we 
have to look to the West to find all our answers? Certainly not!

<a name="taxa">Taxation system: mobilise the will-to-pay!</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Mahnaz Fatima

WHILE this is a subject for the public finance experts to dwell upon, one 
of their miserable failures has been their inability to drive home the 
importance of bringing about horizontal equity in the structure of taxation 
in Pakistan as a first step towards the development of any effective system 
of taxation worth the name.
    
Any structure based on inequality to begin with is bound to be as 
ineffective as our taxation system has been and will continue to be so 
until such time that the mother of inequities, that is, preferential 
treatment to agricultural incomes, is taken care of. All attempts at 
improvement in the taxation structure in the past have actually been 
efforts in marking time as all experts and advisers continued to look the 
other way from the issue of agricultural income tax.
    
While, subsequent to the agricultural income tax ordinance during Mr. Moeen 
Qureshis stint, three of the countrys provinces legislated it; the 
province of Punjab continued to oppose it so much so that even the last 
caretaker set-up failed to have an ordinance promulgated to this effect in 
the said province. In fact, Benazirs post-1996-97 budget instructions to 
the said province vis-`-vis quick action on this front was one of the moves 
that marked the beginning of the downfall of her second government.
    
So, the issue is a sensitive one for a political government to handle. 
However, it is critical to the development of an effective system of 
taxation because of which it cannot also be allowed to remain on a slow 
burner for too long as there is a dire need to generate resources from 
within the country to narrow the resource gap through internally generated 
funds. 

And, the silver lining is the verbal support to the idea of agricultural 
income tax that is now provided by the major farmlords in the country. This 
in itself is significant progress in the right direction as compared to the 
strong verbal opposition that they provided in the past. In the past, 
however, there did exist a case of implicit taxation of the agricultural 
sector as industry was pronounced as the only engine of growth. 
Consequently, conditions were created that provided all incentives to the 
industry to the extent of an extraction of surplus from the agricultural 
sector that was diverted to the industrial sector.
    
The output prices of the agricultural sector were kept depressed with a 
view to providing cheap inputs to our largely agro-based industry. Also, 
the food prices were kept low with a view to keeping the urban wage bill 
low enough for industrial development. The exchange rate was also kept 
artificially overvalued with a view to helping the import-reliant industry 
but which adversely affected the export earnings of the farmers.
    
These conditions exist no more for the agricultural sector. Consequently, 
the case for agricultural income tax has become stronger than the case 
against it. This coupled with a strong awareness-raising campaign even 
convinced the IMF to include it in its package. And, the last Benazir 
government budgeted a paltry Rs. 2 billion in the October 96 mini-budget 
when the estimated potential is forty to fifty times as much.
    
The above developments coupled with some strong farmer community opinion 
mobilisers and a heavy mandate to the current elected government should 
serve to provide impetus to the need for introducing horizontal equity in 
our taxation structure as one of the prerequisites for developing an 
effective system of taxation.
    
The strategy could include a strong educational campaign, debate, dialogue, 
and negotiations with the feudal interest groups by the current government 
on this crucial issue.  This campaign would even jibe with the PML(N)s 
emphasis on economic self-reliance.
    
A sincere and an earnest campaign could serve to convince the feudals to 
begin to contribute their share to the economy as, according to the basic 
principle of horizontal equity, equals should pay equally. And, now there 
is no reason why feudals should continue to enjoy a preferential treatment 
in this regard.

Parallel campaign
    
A parallel campaign could be initiated against tax evasion through which 
business and industry need to be convinced about giving their due share to 
the economy as it is in the long term interest of business and industry to 
strive to enter into a harmonious and a virtuous cycle of development with 
the countrys economy.
    
There is also a need for an inter-sectoral dialogue between the 
representatives of the agricultural and the industrial sectors who should 
together thrash out the critical issue of internal resources generation.  
For, hitherto, businesses have felt justified in evading taxes because of 
the preferential treatment accorded to the agricultural sector and the 
farmlords have felt justified in claiming a preferential treatment because 
of the incentives/concessional packages granted to the business/industrial 
sector.
    
Now that economic self-reliance is likely to become the cornerstone of 
Pakistans economic policy, the two key sectors of the country need to 
lower communication barriers between them and should engage in constructive 
dialogue on the issue of internal resource mobilisation.
    
Yet another basic principle of taxation is one of vertical equity, that is, 
unequals should be taxed unequally on the basis of the ability-to-pay.  
Here too, there is a glaring anomaly as the lower income segments are 
burdened more in proportion to their incomes than the upper income segments 
because of the tax exemptions that they enjoy.
    
The proposals of some public finance experts vis-a-vis taxation of perks 
and privileges enjoyed by bureaucrats and those who draw very high five-to 
six-figure salaries have not been able to see the light of the day. 
   
The last Benazir government adopted this proposal partially for the private 
sector and kept the bureaucrats exempt. This discriminatory treatment would 
again render any tax effort ineffective. And, above all, even the high 
income groups will not want to pay higher taxes for as long as the 
principle of vertical equity is not applied across the board. That is, for 
as long as the heads of the state, the government, and the federal/state 
ministries are not seen to be paying taxes in proportion to their incomes. 
Currently, many of them are known for not paying taxes when they should be 
leading by giving personal examples and excelling in tax-payment. Unless 
they lead by example, their exhortations to the effect will fall on deaf 
ears.

Development key
    
So, the key to the development of an effective taxation structure is to 
make it equitous, both horizontally and vertically. Hitherto, the efforts 
of public finance experts have been directed at making it efficient through 
withholding taxes and taxes that would be easier and sure to collect.
    
The idea has been to tax those goods whose supply and demand are relatively 
inelastic. Consequently, such taxes turn out to be regressive in nature as 
the lower income segments are made to bear a disproportionately higher 
burden. So, such drives at efficiency have only served to axe the weak who 
can be netted.
    
The powerful are not netted in due proportion to their incomes which is why 
tax reform since 1992, despite many man-hours of effort and even higher 
opportunity cost, has only produced dismal results. There is, therefore, a 
need to shift the tax reform emphasis to equity. For, key to effective tax 
mobilisation is to mobilise the human will-to-pay as the ability-to-pay 
cannot be mobilised for as long as the people see gross horizontal and 
vertical inequities in the taxation structure as is currently the case in 
Pakistan.
    
Tax administration is yet another aspect of effective taxation system in 
the country. The income tax department is known to be full of tax sharks 
who, allegedly, make the life of tax-payers miserable. Usually symptomatic 
cure is suggested that revolves around a system of heavy penalties to deter 
deviant behaviour when there is a need for institutional reform that would 
include, interalia, development of fool proof systems and good human 
resources management practices.
    
These, in turn, would necessitate decent levels of compensation that would 
obviate the need for extra incomes by capitalising on the misdeclarations 
of many tax payers. Low paid income tax department employees succumb to the 
temptation of extortion especially when they see big fish trying to evade 
taxes. 
   
There is then a desire to share the gain with the evader who cannot resist 
effectively since he is on a weak wicket himself.
    
The effort at reform, therefore, has to be two-pronged. That is, first, 
there is a need to reform tax declaration itself as suggested in the 
preceding sections. Second, there is a need to reform tax collection by 
minimising the need to extort in the tax collectors are well-compensated. 
   
Also, if misdeclarations are reduced, then there will be a resistance from 
the tax-payer too who should see no need to bribe if his declaration is an 
honest one and can be proved so in any court of law.
    
Unless the above weaknesses in the taxation system of the country are 
addressed adequately, all efforts at tax reform will amount to a mere 
clumsy tinkering with the system with little or no tangible results when 
the need of the hour is to bring about a quantum change.

<a name="anag">An agenda for austerity and welfare</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Mohammad Uzair

PAKISTANI society is known to be badly infected by consumerism, both at 
the governmental level and at the level of people at large. Ironically, 
millions do not get a square meal and potable water. It is, therefore, 
imperative that a mission is undertaken to counter the waste and to 
introduce Austerity at every level. Let us first look at the government and 
the people in government, both politicians and bureaucracy, because good 
examples, like bad examples, are introduced from the top.
    
The famous moral of Persian literature (Saadi) had said long ago, that if a 
king plucks one fruit from an orchard, the rest of the government machinery 
would rob and ruin the entire orchard. The President, the Prime Minister, 
other ministers and advisors should voluntarily forego some of the 
luxurious facilities that are dispensable. When they go abroad the size of 
the entourage should not include more than half a dozen persons, none of 
them relatives or family members. If businessmen accompany in certain tours 
they should obviously bear their own expenses. Similarly, giving lavish 
gifts to visitors or hosts, ranging from a carpet to a horse, should be 
discontinued. Size of personal staff should also be reduced. Position of 
Additional Secretary should be abolished. It will save money and time, by 
eliminating one layer in the process of decision making.
    
There are many public sector organisations with heavy over-staffing and 
alleged corruption and/or downright pilferage. It is admitted by honest 
professional people in some of these organisations that efficiency would 
improve if personnel are reduced by 150 per cent. Pakistan Steel and PIA 
are generally accused of these evils. The same is true to DFIs and banks. 
They should be headed and manned by the people with recognised competence 
as well as integrity. Unfortunately honesty and integrity are not 
considered to be important at all. No family connections or parochial 
considerations should be allowed. Then, we need to trim and prune Export 
Promotion Bureau, which naturally operates in a bureaucratise manners. It 
has done precious little for export promotion. We should have a 
professional and smaller body instead of a bureau. Every once in a while 
the businessmen approach State Bank and the government with a request for 
devaluation of Rupee to encourage exports.

Productivity

Our businessmen and industrialists should learn to raise productivity, 
reduce cost, improve standards of quality, and keep in sight the objective 
of national goodwill and honesty in the long run, instead of limited and 
immediate interests. If we can not adopt the standards of Japan in exports, 
at least we should try to attain the level of Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and 
Malaysia.
    
Now there are certain things which should be done at the national level. 
Some of the suggestions are:
    
 People in the government, from the President to joint secretaries, should 
not attend the weddings except in cases where the bride or bride-groom are 
directly related.
    
 Size of wedding gatherings should be reduced. The wedding was held on 
February 18, 1997 of an Indian girl Priyanika of Nehru family, daughter, 
grand daughter, and great grand daughter of Prime Ministers. The wedding 
was attended by only 200 guests.
    
 There should be no large scale ceremonies of Mehndi or Mangni. Total 
gathering should not be more than forty. Preferably these ceremonies should 
be done away with; and if at all it is necessary it should be only a family 
affair. All the ceremonies including weddings should be over before 10:30 
P.M. It will save electricity as well as time of the guests.
    
 Import of cars, air-conditioners, refrigerators, deep freezers should be 
made to attain largest possible degree of deletion.
    
It is suggested that a consumption tax be introduced to make sure that 
luxurious and conspicuous expenditure is reduced and discouraged. Some of 
the taxable items of consumption would be:
    
 Houses built on a plot of land exceeding 600 sq. yards (one kanal) but 
not exceeding 1000 sq.yards should qualify for a tax of Rs 50,000 per 
annum. The houses on a plot of land exceeding 1000 sq. yards should qualify 
for a tax of Rs 100,000 per annum. This tax is over and above property tax 
charged by the Provincial Governments.
    
 Cars exceeding 1000cc, but not exceeding 1300cc, would qualify for a tax 
of Rs 25,000 per annum. Cars between 1300cc, and 1500cc should qualify for 
a tax of Rs 40,000 per annum. Cars exceeding 1500cc, should qualify for a 
tax of Rs 60,000 per annum. Pajeros, Mercedes and other expensive cars, if 
imported by VIPs or rich businessmen or feudal, should be taxed at a rate 
of Rs 100,000 per annum (besides import duty. Nobody should be permitted to 
import duty free cars). This consumption tax would be over and above 
Vehicles or Road Tax.
    
 Dish antenna licence fee should be taxed at a rate of Rs 10,000 per annum 
as against present rate of Rs 2,000 per annum.
    
 Luxurious and pompous wedding dinners or lunches could be taxed at the 
following rates:
    
a) Those held in five star or four star hotels would qualify for a tax of 
Rs 30,000/-
    
b) Wedding dinners and lunches held in large clubs and lawns with a 
capacity of more than one thousand should be taxed at a rate of Rs 15,000/-
    
c) Wedding dinners and lunches in clubs or lawns with a capacity of more 
than 500 guests but not exceeding one thousand guests should be taxed at a 
rate of Rs 7,500.
    
d) Wedding dinners and lunches is small marriage halls or lawns with a 
capacity of about 500 guests should be taxed at a rate of Rs 2,500.
    
Proceeds of this proposed consumption tax should be used to constitute a 
Price Stabilisation and Assistance Fund. Government may also add some 
amount to this Fund, to make it effective. Prices of a basket of some basic 
food items, which affect a common man, should be stabilised and even 
reduced. This would mean some selected items of food. Production of these 
items should be planned and ensured so that their quantity and supply 
should be abundant, and not only prices are not high, but can come down to 
a lower level.
    
Assistance should be sought from Pakistan Agriculture Research Council, 
Agriculture Price Committee, experts from Agricultural University, 
Faisalabad, some officers of Federal and Provincial Agricultural 
departments. This body should monitor sowing and production of certain 
agricultural items, some of these are known as Minor Crops, and therefore 
neglected. Financial assistance to the farmers should be provided from the 
proposed Fund. These items are:
    
a) Wheat, and Atta made from it;
    
b) Sugarcane, and sugar made from it;
    
c) Rice;
    
d) Pulses (Dal) of different kinds;
    
e) Chickpeas and gram which have high nutritive value and are used by the 
common-man;
    
f) Some vegetables like onion, potatoes, tomatoes, pumpkin etc.;
    
g) Raw material for edible oil should be sown locally to facilitate local 
production of edible oil at a cheaper price;
 
h) Poultry farming.
    
The government should do away with Utility Stores Corporation, Ration 
Shops, and Fair Price Shops. The cost is high, and benefit is very 
marginal. Economic problems should be solved in economic manner and not by 
creating un-necessary bodies.
    
In the field of food, it is imperative that the new government may like to 
make special efforts to promote two industries, largely neglected in the 
past. These are large-scale animal ranching and dairy farming. These would 
increase the supply of meat and milk, and thus lower their prices. We can 
have joint ventures with suitable businessmen and investors in Australia, 
Canada and Denmark. Their participation should be for ten to fifteen years, 
after which local investors can be self sufficient. It will mean a great 
contribution to the economy. We can also have a white revolution (milk) 
as some other countries have had. We can also make good quality powder 
milk locally in collaboration with foreign companies. In fact we can even 
export powder milk, and other dairy products, to neighbouring countries in 
the Gulf. Cost of production and cost of freight can both be reduced by 
production in Pakistan. We can have some increase in our exports and 
foreign exchange earnings.
    
There are a couple of matters in the sphere of fiscal administration. The 
first is Iqra Surcharge. Figures of this tax should be clearly mentioned 
in budget and its proceeds should be reserved and utilised solely for 
education, especially primary education in villages.
    
It is no secret that feudal do not like the villagers in their 
constituencies to be educated. Government has to take strict administrative 
measures to ensure basic education in villages, where 60  70 per cent of 
population lives. Adult-education programme is also needed. Irony is that 
the feudal send their own sons and even daughters to foreign countries for 
higher education, but would not like their Haris and Muzareen to get even 
primary education to their children. Even some semi-urban and urban areas 
need some efforts. Misuse of Iqra Funds for purposes other than education 
is morally objectionable. A more objectionable matters is Zakat education 
and its use or suspected misuse.
    
There is no public disclosure, about figures of Zakat deduction, and 
details of its utilisation. People are un-happy about this situation. Many 
people sign and submit false affidavits to avoid deduction of Zakat. Items 
for which Zakat funds can be used are specifically mentioned in the Holy 
Quran. Moreover, Zakat is a religious obligation (Ibadat). Any mishandling 
of Zakat funds is tantamount to a crime or sin, besides begin politically 
and socially un-popular. Zakat Budget should be prepared and publicised 
separately, at the time general budget is presented.
    
It is hoped that historic success of the new government, will lead to 
certain bold efforts and actions neglected in the past. Austerity and 
Welfare Programme is a challenge which should be sincerely and efficiently 
met.

<a name="lead">Leading scrips finish with fresh gains: index recovers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 14: Stocks extended the previous rally as the short Friday 
session saw leading shares finishing with fresh gains on active follow-up 
support.
    
Although the KSE 100-share index managed to recover fresh ground, 
signalling that it is heading for its pre-action level of 1,650 points but 
some analysts still have some doubts about a sustained run-up.
    
However, the fresh recovery of about 15 points and that too at the weekend 
session points to revival of strong foreign demand during the next week.
    
The formation of government in Sindh seems to have defused the political 
tension luring investors back in the rings in a bigger way, dealers said.
    
In normal conditions, the weekend sessions always attract profit-selling as 
investors are not inclined to hold long positions in view of the 
uncertainties linked with the two closures but weekend rally certainly 
points to smooth sailing during the next week.
    
There is a perception and shared by many that the new Sindh coalition 
government could ensure lasting peace in the city and that is what the 
market needs now, analysts said.
    
They said investors are back in the rings led by some of the foreign funds.
    
The market should have given more encouraging performance but for weekend 
considerations as some of the leading investors were not inclined to take 
bigger risks, they added.
    
But most of the local institutional traders and some of the foreign 
investors were active on selected counters, which in turn evoked good 
sympathetic short-covering on some other selected counters.
    
Although the market advance was led by most of the leading shares, which 
attracted active short-covering at the lower levels, some of the second-
liners also came in for active support and finished recovered.
    
Unlike previous sessions, the market has some special feature both in terms 
of good gains and large volume as a section of operators were not inclined 
to miss the rising market.
    
While both Hub-Power and PTC vouchers led the list of volume leaders, some 
of the multinational recovered broadly under the lead of Dawood Hercules 
and some others, reflecting the presence of strong foreign demand at the 
lower levels.
    
However, bulk of the short-covering remained confined to bank, cement, 
energy and some of the pharma and chemicals shares, which rose appreciably 
amid active support at the lower levels.
    
Some of the inactive shares also attracted good support on news of higher 
interim earnings and rose sharply, major gainers among them being Sitara 
Chemicals and Security Paper.
    
But market has some depressants too, notably bad news from the export front 
and some problems with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in regard to 
conditionalities attached to standby credit.
    
Big gainers were led by Askari Leasing, Faysal Bank, PSO, Fauji Fertiliser, 
Sitara Chemicals, and Security Papers, which showed gains ranging from Rs 2 
to 5.
    
But the largest gain of Rs 12.75 was noted in Dawood Hercules, which came 
in for strong covering purchases on news of higher interim sales. IGI 
Insurance, which announced bonus shares at the rate of 20 per cent a day 
earlier came in for active selling and was marked down by Rs 3. Parke-
Davis, Abbott Lab and Ciba-Geigy were among the other prominent losers.
    
Owing to a half Friday session, trading volume fell to 30 million shares 
from the previous 41 million shares, bulk of which again went to the credit 
of Hub-Power and PTC vouchers.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, up 25 paisa on 8 million 
shares followed by PTC vouchers, higher 20 paisa on 6,560 million shares, 
ICI Pakistan, firm 20 paisa on 4.350 million shares, Dewan Salman, steady 
five paisa on 3 million shares, FFC-Jordan Cement, higher 40 paisa on 2 
million shares, and Dhan Fibre, lower five paisa on 0.950 million hares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Dhan Fibre, easy five paisa on 
0.719m, Fauji Cement, up 20 paisa on 0.5m, D.G.Khan Cement, higher 50 paisa 
on 0.161m, ICI Pakistan (r), firm 25 paisa on 01.26m and Nishat Mills, 
higher 75 paisa on 0.103m shares.

<a name="moha">Mohammed Ali Jinnah</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

MEN such as Mohammed Ali Jinnah are more controversial when dead than when 
alive. The film now being shot, entitled simply Jinnah, the name by which 
the founder of our country wished to be known and recognised, has been made 
controversial. Nothing new, nothing surprising, given the moral and 
intellectual dishonesty that swamps this country.
    
Jinnah achieved what few have achieved. Stanley Wolpert, who has written 
the best biography of the man so far published, which was also made 
controversial, summed up Jinnah with perfection in the opening lines of his 
preface:
    
Few individuals significantly alter the course of history. Fewer still 
modify the map of the world. Hardly anyone can be credited with creating a 
nation-state. Mohammed Ali Jinnah did all three.
    
When Wolperts book, Jinnah of Pakistan, was published by Oxford University 
Press-New York in 1984, OUP- Pakistan immediately imported 500 copies. But, 
before putting it up for sale, OUP sent two copies to Zias information 
ministry, the men of which upon reading it immediately took hypocritical 
umbrage at two factual paragraphs and one sentence relating to Jinnahs 
eating and drinking habits. The ministry confiscated the remaining 498 
copies, and distributed them to visiting dignitaries and to in-favour 
intellectuals of this land who it was felt would not be incapacitated by 
the truth.
    
The government later relented and informed OUP that the book could be 
reprinted and distributed were Wolpert to agree to delete the passages 
imagined to be offensive. Wolpert, naturally, rejected outright the absurd 
suggestion. It was not until 1989, when Wolpert was called in by Benazir 
Bhutto to write a biography of her father, that it was reprinted by OUP in 
its unexpurgated version and found its way into our bookshops.
    
Now to the film, Jinnah. This present controversy has been blown up by one 
newspaper which has printed a sustained series of front-page and other 
articles mainly by an unnamed special correspondent. The man writing 
these pieces should have had the courage of his convictions and put his 
name to what was written. This controversy can only further the cause of 
violent religious bigotry, which this present government is doing its best 
to curb, and to stir up anti-Indian feelings at a time when the government 
is taking steps towards solving some of the differences with our neighbour.
    
The objections of the newspaper in question are to a script it claims 
existed in September last year. Now, film scripts are updated and changed 
from day to day. I have gone through the script, as it is now, and have 
found nothing in it that can possibly be termed, by even the most hard-core 
bigot, either anti-Islamic, anti-Pakistani, anti-Jinnah or anti-anything. 
There is no mention of any angel, let alone Gabriel, and there is no 
boatman telling Jinnah to shut up, as has been trumpeted by the 
publication in question. In fact, it is apparent that those making the film 
have been most careful to ensure that the sensibilities of the run-of-the-
mill tunnel-minded opinionated monomaniacs of this land are well protected 
from illusory hurt.
    
Making a film on Jinnah is not easy. One has to be imaginative, which 
producer-director Jamil Dehlavi undoubtedly is. Jinnahs life was neither 
dramatic nor stirringly heroic, nor the stuff of which epics are made. He 
was never a self-styled martyr, he never went to jail, he never went on 
hunger strike, he never led marches or processions, he indulged in no 
political gimmicks. He made his point and got what he wanted through calm 
and determined negotiation. He was an Anglo-Saxon by bent and training, he 
was a man of strong secular beliefs, forward- looking, shrewd, who knew 
well the difference between religion and religiosity. He had a flexibility 
of spirit and mind  qualities lacking in the men and women for whom he 
made a country. He wanted a modern Pakistan, in tune with the democratic 
liberal world.
    
One excellent thing the script writers have done is to include a scene 
showing Jinnah speaking to the Constituent Assembly in Karachi on August 
11, 1947, when he set forth for the future framers of the constitution of 
this land what was, in essence, his creed:
 
If we want to make this great state of Pakistan happy and prosperous we 
should wholly and solely concentrate on the well- being of the people. You 
are free. Free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or 
to any other place of worship in this state of Pakistan. You may belong to 
any religion or caste or creed  that has nothing to do with the business 
of the state... my guiding principle will be justice and fair play without 
any prejudice or ill-will, partiality or favouritism. We must root out the 
poison of nepotism and corruption. And I am sure with your support and co-
operation I can look forward to Pakistan becoming one of the greatest 
nations of the world.
    
Alas, none of this was to be. Jinnah died too soon, leaving behind too few 
honest men of vision.
    
Akbar S. Ahmed, the executive producer of the film is also a controversial 
figure, either liked or strongly disliked. He is a professor of 
anthropology who has held the Iqbal Chair at Cambridge for the past five 
years, and a Fellow of Selwyn College. Such positions are not attained by 
sycophancy or by clout, but by merit, when a man is recognised for his 
intellectual worth. He is also on the panel chosen by the Prince of Wales 
to advise him on the various projects relating to ethnic minorities in 
Britain.
    
The newspaper, which for its own peculiar reasons, has chosen to churn and 
stir up public opinion about everything to do with the film, objects to the 
choice of Christopher Lee to play Jinnah, on the ground that 40 years ago 
he acted as Dracula. In his career, this fine character actor has acted in 
some 260 films, in countless different and divergent roles. He is 74 years 
old, he looks, walks and talks like Jinnah, and he can in no way be termed 
anti-Pakistan. A ludicrous charge to bring against him.
    
An objection has also been made to Shashi Kapoor, an internationally famed 
actor who happens to be an Indian and a Hindu. Is criticism on these two 
grounds at all valid or logical? Since he is being constantly mobbed in the 
lobby of his hotel and when he goes out to the set, it seems that the sane 
and sensible Pakistani has no objections to him at all. Jinnah certainly 
had no objections to Hindus. One of his closest friends and confidants was 
Kanji Dwarkadas.
 
I do not claim to be an authority on Jinnah, but I can make an assessment 
of what the man was like from the stories and anecdotes I have heard about 
him in my childhood and youth from his contemporaries. Jinnah was in and 
out of the Karachi and Bombay houses of H.J. Rustomjee, my mothers 
grandfather, and spent much time with his sons, Pestonjee and Dhunjishaw. 
And I used to hear much about him from my father, and from his architect, 
Dinshaw Daruwalla, and his personal legal adviser, Minocher Kotwal.
    
My advice to the producers was to show Jinnah, the man, as those close to 
him knew him  Muslims, Hindus, Parsis and British  to show him as he was, 
a normal human being with no false pretensions, who behaved as a normal 
human being, was treated like one, and who enjoyed the good things that 
life has to offer. Had they done so, the film would surely be banned in 
this land of myths and delusions and thus make a lot of money. But they did 
not want to risk it.
    
The film is being funded by private enterprise and the government, who are 
satisfied with its veracity and viability. Let it be seen and then let the 
controversy begin. Some will like it, some will not, there will be much 
valid and invalid criticism. Let those now criticising it, before it is 
made, make their own film on Jinnah, a better one. No one is stopping them. 
We will cheer them on.

The timing of a film on Jinnah and his life is important. Few in the West 
are really interested in Jinnah. A film on him, under normal circumstances, 
would find a poor audience. But there will be interest in him and his times 
later this year when the 50th anniversary of the loss of the Indian Empire 
is commemorated with much fanfare. This is the ideal time for Jinnah to be 
released and shown, when the flame of the old dead Raj flares briefly 
again. Let thousands of people who have barely heard the name Jinnah learn 
about him, his achievement, and his place in history.

<a name="thej">The Jinnah film</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

THERE are two ways in which we can honour the memory of Quaid- i-Azam 
Mohammad Ali Jinnah. The first is that we order our national lives in 
accordance with the guidelines he set for his vision of Pakistan.
    
The second is that we allow him to rest in peace. The first is too 
idealistic and it has not suited the successive cliques or coteries or in-
groups who have assumed or seized leadership through manipulation or 
subterfuge or force majeure and become the custodians of our lives, become 
what is sneeringly called the ruling elite. The second too is not possible 
since we have decided to observe his birth and death anniversary and these 
occasions provide an opportunity to issue messages that reek of earnestness 
and sanctimonious humbug and to hold meetings and seminars where speakers 
invariably lament weepily our departure from his principles. There is too 
the ritual of visits to his Mazaar and any one who assumes public office, 
places a wreath on his grave, converting the visit, into a photo-
opportunity. This has become a mechanical exercise, something that comes 
with the job. It goes without saying that the Quaid would have thoroughly 
disapproved of this kind of an homage as he would have thoroughly 
disapproved of the shambles we have made of his dream.
    
Now a film on him is being produced and it has created a fierce controversy 
even before a foot of the film has been shot. It is hard to pin down the 
precise objections to the film beyond the fact that, in the perception of 
the critics, the wrong people are involved in the production of the film 
and there are serious misgivings about their motives.
    
As the controversy heats up, bits and pieces of the supposed script have 
been somewhat mysteriously released to the press. Objection too has been 
taken to the casting of a Mr Christopher Lee as Jinnah, the objection being 
based on the fact that the actor has played the role of Dracula in the 
past. Objection too has been taken to the choice of the director Mr Jamil 
Dehlavi, whose past, according to these critics, has been shady. And there 
is Mr Shashi Kapoor who has been cast as the narrator who is an Indian and, 
therefore, creates his own turbulence. And looming over all these is the 
major domo of the project Prof. Akbar S. Ahmed. Let me make it clear that I 
know none of these people either personally or by reputation. I have read 
the names of Shafqat Jamote and Shariffudin Pirzada as having some 
connection with the film. These two I know and have for them both, respect 
and affection and in the case of Shariffudin Pirzada also admiration. My 
friend Ardeshir Cowasjee has given him the jolly sounding name of Jadoogar. 
It has been said of him that asked by Ziaul Haq to produce a rabbit from a 
hat he produced the Eighth Amendment. No ordinary rabbit but Bugs Bunny!
    
Not knowing any of the people involved in the film, I also know nothing of 
film making. I cannot offer any opinion on whether the right people are 
making the film or whether the script, snatches of which I have read in the 
newspapers, shows up the Quaid-i-Azam as a caricature, as the critics 
maintain or as a great leader as the producers insist. We will only know 
when the film has been completed.
    
It is necessary, however, to obtain some sort of clarification about the 
funding of the film. Is it being privately financed or has the Government 
of Pakistan some financial stake in it? The idea of wanting to know is to 
fix the responsibility as regards the end-product. But let me put this film 
in perspective. In 1983 Sir Richard Attenborough made a film on Gandhi. The 
film was widely acclaimed and I wrote a column on it, that is to say, 14 
years ago. Much of what I wrote applies to the present controversy. I had 
written that our own response to the Gandhi film was that there should be 
one on the Quaid-i-Azam. The point I made was that it was irksome that the 
interest in a film on the Quaid has been triggered by the fact that a film 
on Gandhi has been made. In other words, it is a reaction and one wonders 
whether there would be this clamouring for the film on the Quaid had there 
not been one on Gandhi. It would be banal to suggest that it would have 
been more appropriate that we should have wanted a film on the Quaid for 
the fact that he was the Father of the Nation rather than merely because we 
have been scooped by a film on Gandhi, I argued.
    
Those who are now demanding that the script of the film should be vetted by 
the government dont entirely realise what they are asking for. This too I 
had anticipated. How would one circumvent the bureaucracy that inevitably 
would want to get involved? There are so many questions that can be asked. 
Film making is highly creative. It brooks no compromise. How will a 
consensus be reached on what the general direction of the film will be? And 
how will the film deal with those who sat out the battle but claimed the 
booty? I had asked.
    
I concluded the column by offering this advice: Perhaps, it might be 
simpler to forget about the film and pay our respects, instead, by working 
for a Pakistan that the Quaid so avowedly wished for its people.
    
I think this advice is still good. But whatever my personal views may be on 
the subject of the film, there is in the raging controversy an element of 
pre-censorship. It does not seem fair to me that something should be 
condemned even before it has taken shape. Once again we find that we are 
not allowing the Quaid-i- Azam to rest in peace. One wishes that the same 
concern and anger would have been shown about the direction of the country 
which appears to be going nowhere than about a film.

<a name="theu">The unwanted baby</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

LIKE an unwanted baby born out of wedlock, the poor Press and Publications 
Ordinance is being shifted surreptitiously from one door to another, but so 
far, the father has not stepped forward to admit his responsibility.
    
My friend, Mushahid Hussain, the prime ministers adviser on information, 
was prompt in distancing his ministry from the paternity suit. The 
caretakers were equally swift in denying parentage, and a spokesman from 
the PPP camp has squarely blamed the Nawaz Sharif government for having 
drafted this draconian and totally unnecessary piece of legislation.
    
Khalid Anwar, the PMs adviser on law, has put up an uncharacteristically 
feeble defence by saying that the information secretary had forwarded the 
summary as a matter of routine to ensure continuity with the 1995 ordinance 
which has been kept alive through four-monthly renewals. So much for the 
supremacy of Parliament. He went on to say to the Islamabad correspondent 
of this newspaper that earlier, there had been no law to deal with the 
Press.
    
Now why there should be separate legislation to deal with the Press is 
beyond me. Surely there are enough libel laws as well as laws against 
subversion and anti-state activities to keep lawyers in business. And Mr 
Khalid Anwar, as an occasional but important contributor to newspapers, 
should be the first to condemn any law that could easily be misused to gag 
the Press.
    
Granted that some sections of the print media have often been libellous in 
their attacks on individuals. But the answer would seem to lie in making 
our totally inadequate libel laws tougher to protect people from unfair 
criticism. As far as I know, nobody has sued a journalist, and editor or a 
publisher successfully for damages arising out of defamation or character 
assassination. And God knows there have been many incidents of orchestrated 
Press campaigns without a shred of proof that would stand up to the acid 
test of judicial probing.
    
However, on balance, our Press has exercised more self-censorship than most 
independent newspapers do abroad. Most publishing groups have other 
business interests to protect, and this makes them wary of antagonising the 
government of the day. Other factors that push editors into erring on the 
side of caution include the very real threat of violence from the many 
armed fringe groups that have sprouted across the country. Then there is 
the whole gamut of legal sanctions against anything that smacks even 
remotely of contempt of court. These provisions are resorted to more often 
in Pakistan than in any other country I know of. Why our honourable judges 
cannot permit free and open debate about their judgements is something I 
have never been able to understand, but perhaps it has something to do with 
our sense of general lack of security as a nation. Then there is a whole 
range of taboos against writing about sex, religion, the defence forces and 
the secret lives of the powerful.
    
Given all these written and unwritten restrictions on the freedom of 
expression, does the government really need another plethora of checks in 
the shape of the Press and Publications Ordinance? Although this is clearly 
a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand is doing, the 
entire episode brings us to the question of presidential ordinances as a 
short-cut to legislation duly debated and framed by Parliament, as 
envisaged by the Constitution. It would seem that before asking the 
President to put his signature to this document, his staff did not 
understand the political and moral implications of this ordinance.
    
Previous governments have often used this constitutional loophole to ram 
through all kinds of dubious and ill-considered legislation. Wishing to 
avoid long drawn-out debate on the floor because of their fragile 
parliamentary majority, successive prime ministers have taken this short-
cut. But Nawaz Sharif has no need for this kind of quickie law-making. If 
the prime minister feels he needs tougher Press laws, he should initiate a 
debate on this important subject in and out of Parliament. Even if one were 
generous enough to concede that he was unaware of the existence of the 
draft, then one is forced to infer that he is not fully in the picture 
about what is happening under him. And that is bad news indeed, given the 
high hopes riding on his shoulders.
    
It is high time that the whole question of issuing presidential ordinances 
at the drop of a hat was reviewed. While this government has rightly 
attacked pomp and privilege in high places, here is a fruitful area left 
unexplored. What could possibly constitute a greater abuse of power than to 
short-circuit the entire parliamentary process at will? This provision was 
originally designed to cater for emergencies that cropped up when 
Parliament was not in session. It was never the intention of the framers of 
the 1973 Constitution to provide impatient rulers with a way to bypass the 
whole system of subjecting draft legislation to scrutiny by Parliamentary 
committees and then by the entire House.
    
The way it works now is that ministries wanting to slip a law through wait 
until Parliament is in recess before moving a summary to the cabinet in 
which they make out a case that the urgency of the matter is sufficient to 
issue an ordinance. Once the President is faced with this fait accompli, he 
has few options but to sign. True, he has the authority to send it back for 
a review, but the whole thing has now become so routine that he just signs 
on the dotted line.
    
To complete this mockery of parliamentary legislation, the same ministries 
then craftily wait until the next break in the session before asking the 
President to re-promulgate the same ordinance. This is what appears to have 
happened in the present case: everybody treated this odious law as 
something they had inherited, and had to keep alive, irrespective of its 
need or merit. In short, it has acquired a life of its own.
    
More often than not, the hassle of piloting legislation through all the 
slow and cumbersome steps required by the Constitution makes it tempting 
for the executive to wish for a short-cut. In this sense, the provisions 
regarding ordinances are very seductive. But on reflection, these very same 
time-consuming requirements decrease the possibility of enacting bad laws. 
The entire system is designed to prevent hasty and ill-considered 
legislation from being passed. Ordinances, on the other hand, are 
essentially a bureaucratic, back-door approach.
    
The PMLs commitment to parliamentary democracy will be fully tested by the 
need to resolve this constitutional contradiction. The party can now prove 
that it can use its overwhelming parliamentary majority to constructive 
ends.

The modern day world is now wired through the advent of high-tech. The 
beaming of events through satellite, the cable channels have made the world 
shrink even to the extent that now if you have facilities available, then 
you need not step out of your own sitting room and you watch the world go 
by.
    
Cricket is one sport which has its own intriguing and exciting web-site on 
the Internet. The most interesting being Cricinfo, the self proclaimed 
Home of cricket on the Internet.
    
This British-based site is the 39th largest Web site and the third largest 
sports site with the potential of being a genuine force for providing 
information on cricket news, features and the ever changing enjoyable 
statistics on the game.
   
The Australian Cricket Page, South Australian Librarys Bradman site or 
West Indian Tony Coziers on-line version on his site, Cricket, are all 
those sites which are full of interest and  anecdotes and stories to thrill 
a cricket buff.
 
Cricinfo had Bradmans Test record match by match and all  the detail that 
one would like to know about his career at all levels.
    
Did you know that a cricketer has won a Nobel Prize? Through Cricinfos on-
line cricket magazine Googlers Gazette I found that out that the Irish 
author Samuel Beckett was the one who  did. A left-handed opener and 
medium-pace bowler for Dublin University, Beckett in his only two first 
class games in 1925 and 1926 made very humble contribution but as a writer 
Beckett was Nobel Laureate.
    
Just zip across the Coopers and Lybrand which gives rating to the players 
of the game and you would find the latest rankings. Whether Wasim Akram is 
heading the averages or Glen McGrath or Saeed Anwar amongst the batsmen, is 
on top of Steve Wough or Greg Blewett.
    
Get into the system and you will browse throw a heap of information of 
Pakistan players and their profiles, as would you find on the pages of 
newspaper on the Internet.

<a name="cric">Cricket triumph in SAARC contest</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

THE SAARC gold cup tournament, launched in 1992 to enhance goodwill and 
friendliness among regional cricketing countries, was deservingly clinched 
by Pakistan at the Dhaka Stadium, built during the days when Bangladesh was 
the eastern wing of this country.
    
Pakistan had been eliminated from the final of the previous competition, 
held in December 1994 and it was India which had performed excellently to 
gain the honours of the four-nation contest. The tournament is supposed to 
be competed by the second string of the Council members of the ICC, though 
Bangladesh, short of first class cricketers, must be fielding their main 
and national side. However, the encounters cannot be downgraded since they 
are occasions to spot out talent. The skill and technique of some of the 
fine performers can be honed to develop them into crafty bowlers and sound 
batsmen.
    
Many may not like a relegation of classification to the competition since 
there were many Test players, apart from fresh hands in the squads of 
Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. Some critics may, nevertheless, dismiss the 
contests as of low level since the Bangladesh cricket officials have not 
yet understood the significance of turf wickets. They point out that the 
nylon surface, on which the matches were arranged, gave little aid to the 
pacers, howsoever effort and labour they put in their deliveries. Others 
are of the opinion that a few medium-pacers who toiled hard with their 
outswingers and cutters reaped the dividends. The artificial surface suited 
the slow spin and the bowlers experimenting with the curving line of the 
flight.
    
Bangladesh may have staged the matches on the Astroturf because most of the 
south-east Asian countries try their luck on it to bag the Asian Cricket 
Council (ACC) trophy honours. However, to develop cricket and to throw down 
the challenge to the heavyweights of the continent it is important for 
Bangladesh to switch over to grass strips. That will determine their true 
merit and help the officials eliminate the flaws in their players.
    
Nevertheless, the result a triumph in the final for Pakistan cannot be 
down-rated. The Indian coach, Srikkanth, thought that the rain, which came 
in the later stages of the last match, spoiled their chances. He felt that 
the Indian batsmen were going on the right course and with five wickets in 
hand victory was not difficult to attain. But the inclement weather changed 
the whole thing.
    
Zaheer Abbas, the Pakistani coach on the contrary, was of the opinion that 
his sides total could not have been overtaken by the Indians, even if the 
rain may not have come. For the lower order batsmen it was rather difficult 
to raise the run-rate to five per over, which was the requirement for 
victory, according to Zaheer.
    
The triumph was significant for the Pakistan A side. In the second one the 
country, captained by Rameez Raja, had put up a lacklustre show and 
surprisingly Bangladesh, the babes among the combatants, had clawed their 
way into the final and India had picked up the laurels.
    
For Asif Mujtaba, the skipper, this was a triumphant visit. He earned the 
verdict of the scribes for the man of match (final) and the man of the 
tournament. As a batsman he scintillated on the field with a responsible 
innings of 91, though studded with slick stokes on a day of lowering clouds 
when four wickets had been lost for a numerically small score of 85. 
Pakistan had little chance. But Mujtaba rose to the occasion confidently to 
play watchful cricket with handsome shots to give India a hard target.
    
His captaincy in the competition had been praiseworthy for in the league 
matches both the strong challengers, India and Sri Lanka, were brought 
down. Even Zaheer Abbas, sent to Dhaka as a coach but a member of the 
selectorial set, gave him his approbation quite warmly for the way he 
handled the difficult situation in the final and his mode and manner of 
batting.
    
Akhtar Sarfraz of Peshawar also showed guts while facing rival bowlers but 
it is difficult to pass a final judgement on his level as a player since 
the strip was synthetic.
    
As a bowler pacers Mohammad Zahid and Aqib Javed harassed the batsmen. On 
an uncertain wicket on which skill and variety were required Aqib 
demonstrated a rhythmical action with controlled outswingers that puzzled 
the batsmen. Here was again a case of injustice to a bowler, who has plenty 
of energy, zest and fire in him. And whenever he has been given a chance in 
Test and one-day international he has proved his prowess and has  been a 
success.

<a name="alib">Ali Bacher favours Two-yearly World Cup</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim-ur-Rahman

KARACHI, March 8: Dr Ali Bacher, chairman of the ICC Development Committee 
and Managing Director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa has 
favoured establishment of five regional structures for the promotion of 
cricket, organising two-yearly World Cup and evolving a right formula for 
establishing a world championship of Test cricket.
    
Dr Bacher said important recommendations in this regard had been presented 
in its interim report which would come up for consideration in its final 
meeting in Malaysia on March 25. The UCBSA Managing Director said the ICC 
Development Committee has recommended that five regional structures should 
be established to expand and promote the game.
    
WORLD CUP: On the frequency of World Cups Dr Bacher said the matter was yet 
to be fully debated and no decisions or recommendations had been taken.
    
The interim report observed that the ICC World Cup tournaments were the 
single most effective marketing tool of cricket as world game and could 
provide source of income necessary to fund the development.
    
It also needs to be shown that a two-yearly World Cup would have 
substantial financial benefits for three of crickets stake holders , 
namely (a) the ICC Development Fund, (b) Associate and Affiliate members 
and (c) the ICC, the interim report observed.
    
It was also necessary to show that the organising country and participating 
countries would not be worse off financially as a result of staging the 
World Cup more frequently.

With the ever-expanding number of channels on television and the vast 
potential for commercial advertising associated with a seven-hour match, 
the following factors must be kept in mind while increasing the frequency 
of World Cup tournaments from four years to two, the development committee 
observed.
    
With a proliferation of one-day tournaments , there was a need to re-focus 
attention on the distinction of the World Cup as the event which determined 
the leaders in one-day international cricket, it said. Supporting the idea 
of holding the World Cup every two years the ICC development committee 
contended that played every two years, it will certify that other one-day 
tournaments (important as they may be to the development and promotion of 
the game within regions), do not supersede the significance and importance 
of the World Cup.
    
The report says that there were indications that TV rights fees would 
continue to increase, and staging the World Cup every two years would 
result in substantial financial benefits to the host country, global 
expansion of the game and development among associate members.
    
The final report will be presented to the ICC before June this year.

<a name="usae">USA emerge champions of CISM Seaweek Games</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Fyfe

KARACHI, March 13: After a hectic struggle with Brazil and Pakistan in the 
pentathlon, the USA emerged the overall champions of the 37th Seaweek 
Military World Championship.
    
Transisco Teiseira, won the Amphibious cross-country event, that included a 
rifle range, the swimming pool, where an athlete paddles his rubber boat 
from one end of the pool to the other, reaching the grenade throwing area 
after running another 400 metres and then sprinting for home, covered this 
gruelling 2500 metres course in a smart time of nine minutes 49.2 seconds.
    
Amjad Usman was second in 10 minutes 16 seconds, while Kevin Montford from 
the USA, a close third, in 10 minutes 17 seconds. This result enabled the 
strong American contingent of Kevin Montford, Joseph Dulin and Joseph Bell, 
amass a total of 17733 points, which was enough to see them through to the 
gold medal.
    
Although Teiseira won the race for Brazil, the trio of Walter Duarte, 
Meneses Antonio Luis and Carlos Mattos, totalled 17415 points to pick up 
the silver medal and Pakistan served by Mumtaz Akbar, Amjad Usman and A.U. 
Rehan grabbed the bronze with 17393 points.
    
The pentathlon consisted of five events, two won by USA, two by Pakistan 
and the last by Brazil.
    
Andrew Hoyer, won both the swimming events for the Americans, but finishing 
fifth overall. Amjad Usman and Mumtaz Akbar won one event each for 
Pakistan.
    
Lying fifth behind Finland and Norway the night before, Pakistan with a 
great last ditch team effort edged out the two Nordic nations seeking a 
medal and only 22 points separated the home team and Brazil for the silver.
    
Norway, were declared the overall Ladies champions after Mona Liverod and 
Catherine Fauske finished first and second in the Amphibious cross country, 
with Sarah Loverich nosing out Tenna Gaarde, the gritty Danish girl for the 
bronze. But it was Catherine Fauske, winning two of her five events and 
finishing third on three occasions, creating in the process a new world 
record in the life saving race, who was declared the Ladies champion, with 
a total of 5978 points. Her team-mate Mona Liverod, took the silver after 
gathering 5807 points and Tenna Gaarde the bronze, with 5695 points, as 
Sarah Loverich slipped down the ladder to fourth spot with 5630 points.
    
The teams placement after all five events were as follows: Norway 
(Catherine Fausk and Mona Liverod) 11785 points first, USA (Sarah Loverich 
and Kara Kauloheras) 11247 points second and Russia (Marina Nagornaya and 
Lutsia Bochkarcva) third with 10659 points. Denmark was placed fourth, 
Turkey fifth, Sweden sixth, Brazil seventh, while Pakistan completed the 
frame in the eight nation ladies competition.
    
The sailing championship also had its fair share of thrills and spills. 
After six races, three countries France, Russia and Denmark, were vying for 
top honours after the Danes shocked all and sundry by winning both their 
races.
    
Pakistan leading the fleet after race four, had two miserable races, 
finishing 11th in the fifth race and a disappointing ninth in the sixth, to 
slip down to the number four spot.
    
France had to only finish two positions behind the Russians, who 
desperately needed to win the final race to seal the fate of the 
championship.
    
Captain A.R, Arshad, the International Race Officer finally got the final 
race under way at 10.20 hours with a light South Westerly wind blowing in a 
strong flood tide.
    
The Russian coxswain Emitri, in a brilliant move manoeuvred his Laser 16 
towards the side of the Committee Boat, a ploy that paid off handsomely, 
with the Russians taking the lead.
    
France, on the other hand in the middle of the fleet, moved inshore with 
most of the boats, due to the flood tide. Continuing to gain the advantage 
the Russians passed the finishing line first. The Danes came second and the 
French leading the other 13 nations on Wednesday night had to be content 
with the fourth spot, just behind the Italians.
    
The Pakistan crew had another miserable morning, finishing ninth once 
again, a position which spelt doom for the Saddiq brothers and their other 
crew member. Although Pakistan did manage to retain the fourth spot, a 
medal which seemed so likely after four races faded away for the host 
nation.

The final standing in the Laser 16 event was Russia 20.1 points 1, France 
25.0 points 2, Denmark 28.7 points 3, Pakistan 49.7 points 4., Germany 53.4 
points 5, Turkey 56.7 points 6, Italy 60.1 points 7, Canada 73.4 points 8, 
Finland 80.0 points 9, Brazil 96.0 points 10, Norway 99.0 points 11, Sweden 
100 points 12 and South Africa 104.0 points 13.

<a name="pane">Panels to organise National Games in Karachi set up</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By A. Majid Khan

KARACHI, March 14: Senior Sindh Minister Dr Farooq Sattar, Chairman of the 
Organising Committee of the 26th National Games, said here today that 
various committees have been formed for holding the games in Karachi in a 
befitting manner and stressed on the need of curtailing the lavish spending 
in the wake of financial constraints.
    
It is a matter of great satisfaction and honour that Karachi is hosting the 
five-day National Games, starting on April 28, and ending on May 2 with 
inaugural and closing ceremonies at the National Stadium, stated the 
chairman of the organising committee.
    
Addressing a crowded Press conference here at a local hotel and preceded by 
a meeting of the organising committee which he chaired, Dr Farooq Sattar 
stated Sindh Chief Minister Liaquat Ali Jatoi is the patron-in-chief of the 
organising committee and the patrons are Dr Nishat Mallick, MNA from 
Karachi and Chief Secretary of the province Saeed Mehdi.

Dr Farooq Sattar stated that about Rs one crore and 20 lakhs are the 
estimated expenditures on the 17 disciplines of the National Games for 
which Rs 30 lakhs had been guaranteed . The PSBS Rs 15 lakhs grant would 
be routed through the Pakistan Olympic Association and another Rs 15 lakhs 
have also been set apart.
    
We have to generate about Rs 90 lakhs through sponsorship for meeting the 
estimated expenditure, he remarked.
    
Dr Farooq Sattar emphasised the necessity of curtailing unnecessary 
expenditures, adding there is no room for huge spending due to financial 
problems.
    
The organising committee chairman further stated it is sheer coincidence 
that the 26th National Games are being held at a time when the new 
government has been formed in Sindh. We work hand in hand to make the 
National Games a success and the committees carry heavy responsibilities 
for ensuring the smooth running of every discipline.
    
The 17 disciplines to be contested are athletics ( men and women),Badminton 
(Men and women), swimming (Men and women), rifle shooting (Men and women), 
tennis (Men and women) , table Tennis (Men and women), boxing, cycling, 
football, hockey, squash, volleyball, weightlifting, yachting and
