<a name="wasi">Wasim declines to defend anti-terrorism law</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Aug 30: Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad, an astute legal expert
himself, on Friday declined to defend the controversial laws introduced
by the Nawaz Sharif government.
   
Mr. Sajjad, who is in US for the last 15 days to speak on 50th
anniversary functions, was asked searching questions by Pakistanis living
in the Washington area at a get-together arranged by the Pakistan
Ambassador at the Embassy. "I welcome the Chairman as we were class mates
in Lahore," Mr. Riaz Khokhar introduced him.
   
After a brief "bird's eye view" of the situation in Pakistan in which Mr.
Sajjad dealt with the economic and political situation and how the Nawaz
Sharif government was tackling it, the floor was opened for questions.

When asked about the controversial anti-terrorism bill, the Senate
Chairman presented "both the viewpoints" before the audience, starting
with the criticism that it gave sweeping powers to a police which "does
not have a good reputation."
   
He said the law had made confessions obtained by the police admissible in
courts and that had generated a lot of criticism. The government, he
said, was arguing that it was not dealing with a normal situation and so
"for an abnormal situation, extra powers were needed."
   
Asked whether as a lawyer and legal expert did he believe that seven days
were enough to investigate a heinous crime and convict a person in a
court and would not the police use the seven days just to "extract"
confessions even from innocent people, Wasim Sajjad said: "You are an
intelligent person. You can draw your own conclusions."

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 1: The Supreme Court on Monday received a writ petition
challenging the federal government's decision of reducing the strength of
judges of the apex court through an executive order.
   
The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) in its writ petition under
Article 184(3), through its secretary Shamim Ahmed Bokhary prayed the
apex court to declare the government's decision as "unconstitutional,
arbitrary, whimsical and malafide." The SCBA also prayed the court to
direct the government through secretary law, justice and parliamentary
affairs to fix the number of judges after consulting the Chief Justice of
Pakistan, and chief justice of the concerned high courts.
   
The petitioner association which made "Pakistan" as respondent stated
that order of the president to reduce the number of judges in the apex
court was violative of the judicial independence which was guaranteed
inter alia under Article 2 A of 1973 Constitution. It submitted that the
executive had caused a blow to the independence of judiciary which
amounted to the denial of fundamental right of getting justice to the
citizens. The SCBA stated that order of urtailing the number of judges of
Supreme Court was contrary to the aspiration and rights of the people of
Pakistan.

<a name="nawi">NA withdraws president, PM privileges</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 1: National Assembly on Monday passed three amendment
bills withdrawing a privilege of the President and the Prime Minister to
import a duty free car and their entitlement of income-tax free salary.
   
The opposition Pakistan People's Party which did not oppose the bills
termed these as 'symbolic gestures' of the government just to pretend
austerity and called for more amendments to withdraw other privileges
available to the president and prime minister.
   
"It is hypocrisy" said Naveed Qamar who had proposed several other
amendments in the same laws for withdrawing the privilege of the
president and the prime minister to import items of personal use
including food stuff and article of furnishing their residences.
   
He pointed out that even the close relatives of the president and the
prime minister were entitled to import the items of personal use. He said
there was no limit on it. Instead of just pretending they should adopt
real austerity measures, he said. "Prime minister still goes to Lahore
twice a day on a chopper," he said. "Prime minister still travels in
large entourage with cavalcade of officials limousines," he said
reminding the treasury benches their claims to do away with the VIP
culture.
   
Waja Karim Dad of the PPP said that the members had been stripped off
their privilege to use the VIP lounges at the airports while other
officials were still enjoying all the perks. He claimed that one day
expenditure of the prime minister house was Rs. 3.5 million.

<a name="prov">Poverty Alleviation Fund Co registered</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Sept 2: The Planning Commission has got registered the
Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Company (PPAFC) as a private limited
company under Sec 42 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, to tackle the
problem through the provision of microcredit to the poor, an official
source told Dawn Tuesday.
   
It will be a non-profit organization with a board of directors at its
apex and comprising three nominees of the Government and nine members
from the private sector. For the present, the deputy chairman of the
Commission, Dr Hafiz A. Pasha is chairman of BoD. Other two officials are
the Finance Secretary, Moin  Afzal and Secretary, Economic Affairs
Division, Javed Burki.
   
Nine non-official members of the BoD are well-known leaders of NGO
movement, namely: M/S Abdul Sattar Edhi, Dr Ayesha Ghous, Dr Mohammad
Tehseen, Dr Zulfikar Jilani, Zubaida Jalal, Suleman Sheikh and Humayun
Murad.
   
The immediate bases of the project are Prime Minister's announcements and
Finance Minister's budget speech in which the Government pledged to stem
the tide of poverty through various measures including, inter alia, the
establishment of village and district support organizations and provision
of micro credit for the poor, promotion of collective savings etc.
  
He had admitted in his budget speech that the percentage of those under
the poverty line had increased in the last ten years from 20 to 25%. The
idea for PPAFC is basically derived from the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh
which has successfully helped reduce population growth rate by providing
microcredit and establish microenterprises in that country. But the main
difference here is that Bangladesh is free of the feudal yoke, while
Pakistan still groans under it, observed a veteran development economist
who did not want to be identified.

<a name="fore">Foreign scholarships being slashed</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Sept 2: The Federal Government has decided to slash the Merit
Scholarship Scheme and to provide funds only for 47 people who are
already studying abroad, according to an official source.
   
The eighth five-year plan had set aside Rs 1.4 billion for scholarships,
out of which an expenditure of Rs 700 million was meant for the Federal
scholarship scheme. Even in the Annual Development Plan, an expenditure
of Rs 20 million was envisaged.
   
According to a revised plan to be considered by the Central Development
Working Party (CDWP), however, the provision has been reduced to a mere
Rs 2.3 million to be consumed over the period 1995-99, i.e. for the
duration of the training course of the individuals already studying
abroad.
   
The objective of the scheme was to make Pakistan self-sufficient in terms
of highly qualified professionals with a view to reducing dependence on
foreign experts.
   
A total of 308 people benefited from the scheme. Out of these, 164
scholars completed Ph.D, and 40 others did M.Sc. Twelve of the
beneficiaries failed to acquire any degree at all.
   
Out of those who completed their course, 14 did not return to Pakistan at
all.

<a name="soft">Software engineers aboard to be lured back</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent
   
ISLAMABAD, Sept 4: The federal government is planning to launch an
ambitious programme to offer employment to the Pakistani software
engineers working abroad.
   
Source said the Information Technology Commission would announce the
programme toward the end of this month.
   
Talking to Dawn, the ITC Chairman, former Senator, Syed Mazhar Ali said
the commission intends to revamp the country's information
technology-related institutions which are presently producing 4000-5000
software engineers, a year.
   
"In India, they produce more than 50,000 such experts every year, and if
we produce them at the present rate, Pakistan would be tragically
deficient in the fields of database development, education and marketing
etc", he said.
   
For this purpose, he added, the relevant institutions presently doing the
systems analyses and other works, would be upgraded to the required
level, with the help of Pakistani software engineers working abroad, to
enable them to be capable of producing better and more exportable
software producers.
   
"These Pakistanis abroad need to be offered better salaries to attract
them homeward, and the government is already working on a programme to
acquire means and resources to allocate the required funds for this
purpose".

<a name="pres">Presidents, PMs & others imported 48 duty-free cars</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report
   
ISLAMABAD, Sept 4: Presidents, prime ministers, governors, chief
ministers and chiefs of armed forces imported 48 duty free cars since
1985, the National Assembly was informed on Wednesday.
   
A list of the cars was presented in the House in reply to a question
along with the value of the vehicles and duty and taxes exempted, showing
that the exempted amount stood at Rs23,76,35,546.
   
According to the details, three cars were imported by presidents, four by
prime ministers, 22 by governors and acting governors, four by chief
ministers and 15 by chiefs of armed forces.
   
The list shows that opposition leader Benazir Bhutto happens to be the
only prime minister who imported duty free car twice. Her party leader
Chaudhary Altaf Hussain (late) also imported two cars during his tenure
as the Punjab chief minister.
   
On a point of order, after the question hour, the Parliamentary Secretary
on Finance Kamil Agha said no member of the ruling party had imported
duty free car.
   
"It is not a tradition with the Muslim Leaguers to import duty free cars
and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif neither as prime minister nor as a chief
minister imported a duty free car."

The following are the details:

<a name="alie">Aliens may get legal status if registered</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report
   
ISLAMABAD, Sept 4: Interior Minister Shujaat Hussain said on Thursday
that the government was studying several proposals to give legal status
to illegal immigrants, particularly the Bengalis, if they opted to stay
in the country and got themselves registered.
   
He was responding to a notice for discussion moved Syed Naveed Qamar of
the PPP regarding the presence of illegal Bengalis and other illegal
nationals who, the PPP leader said, were contributing to various crimes
in Karachi.
   
Mr Shujaat said his ministry had already prepared a summary to address
the problem of illegal immigrants, at least for Karachi. The summary, he
said, proposed registration of illegal immigrants in the Sindh capital so
that their stay could be legalized, if they so desired. Otherwise, they
would be sent back to their countries.

The interior minister said the main cause of hindrance in the formulation
of a national policy on illegal immigrants was that they hailed from
various countries, the number of Bengalis being over 1.1 million. He said
most of them had opted to stay in Pakistan at the time of partition and
now had families here, and the government could not simply throw them out
of the country. Mr. Shujaat Hussain said the next cabinet meeting would
discuss a detailed report on the problem of illegal immigrants and might
consider a proposal to start their registration.

Dawn has learnt that the proposal, which was presented to the cabinet at
a previous meeting, had suggested an amendment to the Foreigners Act of
1946 but the cabinet, after discussion, deferred the matter until more
facts were brought to its knowledge. However, in the meantime, it issued
instructions that Rangers, the Frontier Corps and the Coast Guard should
keep an eye on the activities of the illegal immigrants in the country.
The interior minister said on Thursday that the Rangers and Customs
authorities had been told to control this problem for future.

<a name="indi">India making talks doubtful</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin
   
ISLAMABAD, Sept 4: Pakistan feels that some of the statements emanating
from India regarding foreign secretary level talks between Pakistan and
India have created doubts about the future of these talks.
   
Sources said that the government has sought clarification from New Delhi
in this regard.
   
Meanwhile, if all goes well and the talks are held on schedule, the
dialogue on Kashmir is likely to be upgraded to the level of foreign
secretaries with the secondary issues left to be sorted out by the
working groups.
   
Under the joint statement issued on June 23, the foreign secretaries were
to have a dual function in terms of the agreed mechanism. One, to deal
with the issues of peace and security and Jammu and Kashmir and the other
to coordinate and monitor the progress of working of all the working
groups.
   
They were thus to have separate meetings for each of these two distinct
functions.
   
However, in view of its importance and the fact that any progress in any
other working group would have no meaning unless there was some
substantial advance on the core issue, Pakistan now feels that the
Kashmir problem should be handled by the foreign secretaries of the two
countries while they are at the same time coordinating and monitoring the
progress of the working groups.
   
India is not likely to have any objection to the change in the structure
of dialogue over Kashmir, because a separate working group on Kashmir in
their view would perhaps serve as a red rag for the opposition BJP.
   
Pakistan is said to be more interested in getting India to start talking
on Kashmir, rather than in any particular structure for the dialogue on
the core issue.
   
"As long as India agrees to talk on Kashmir, Pakistan will talk whatever
the forum," said an informed source.

<a name="scsu">SC suspends order to cut its strength</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali
   
ISLAMABAD, Sept 5: The chief justice of Pakistan, Sajjad Ali Shah,
suspended the operation of the president's order reducing the number f
judges of the apex court from 17 to 12. The CJ passed the order on a writ
petition filed by the Supreme Court Bar Association. The main petition of
the SCBA, challenging the government's decision, is still pending in the
Supreme Court.
   
After the order passed the government will now have to take a decision on
the CJ's recommendation for the elevation of five judges to the apex
court.
   
According to the Supreme Court verdict in the judges case, the opinion of
the chief justice of Pakistan carried great weight in the appointment of
judges, and if the government disagreed with his recommendation, it could
reject the name proposed by him but would be bound to give reasons in
writing. The government's reasons for rejection of chief justice's
nominee would be "justiciable".
   
The chief justice in his interim order decided to place the case before a
bench of three judges or more. Prominent constitutional lawyers S.M.
Zafar and Sharifuddin Pirzada have been requested by the Supreme Court to
appear as amicus curiae in the case when the petition came up for
hearing.
   
When the hearing of SBSA application resumed, Attorney- General Chaudhry
Mohammad Farooq placed on record a copy of the summary moved by the law
ministry on Aug 21, for the reduction of the number of Supreme Court
judges, and also a copy of the letter sent by the chief Justice on Aug 20
for the elevation of five judges of high courts to the SC.
   
The attorney-general, however, stated that the court should not look into
the advice tendered by the prime minister to the president, as envisaged
under article 48(4) of the Constitution. He informed the court that the
government had "at present" no plan to introduce a bill for fixing the
number of Supreme Court judges. The attorney-general had been asked by
the chief justice on Thursday to inquire of the government if it had any
plan to fix the number of SC judges through an Act of parliament.
   
The chief justice observed that the question of independence of the
judiciary and public importance was involved in this case, and it would
be placed before a bench of three or more judges.
   
Mr Bokhari further stated that, according to the constitutional history,
the strength of the Supreme Court could be increased but not decreased.
He said in the 1956 Constitution, article 148 had fixed the number of
judges of the Supreme Court at six and authorized parliament to increase
it. In the 1962 Constitution, he argued, article 49 envisaged that the
number of judges might be determined by law or, until so determined,
might be fixed by the president.
   
He submitted that the 1973 Constitution provided in article 176 that the
number of Supreme Court judges was to be determined by an Act of
parliament, and until so determined, might be fixed by the president. He
further submitted that even in 1971, when half of the country was lost,
the number of judges of the Supreme Court was not decreased.

<a name="inde">Index falls 43.82 points on foreign selling</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 1: Stocks fell across a broad front on Monday on near-panic
selling by all and sundry, intensifying the current bear-run on the
leading index shares and some other current favorites. The index was down
43.82 points or 2.5 per cent on foreign liquidation triggered by reports
of devaluation of the rupee.
   
The 100-share index was quoted at 1,698.33 in the morning session as
compared to 1,744.64 at the last weekend owing to the weakness of the
base shares.
   
Analysts said the breach of the support level of 1,700 points could lead
the market where bears want it too and the next resistance level could be
1,500 points or below it as investors are not inclined to buy at the
falling prices.
   
The closure of the stock market for official trading on Wednesday at the
time of prime minister's visit also added to current bear-run as it is
considered to be an unusual step as on such occasions markets should
remain open, some stock analysts said.
   
It was in this background that minus signs dominated the list as out of
345 actives 235 shares fell, 40 rose with 70 holding on to the last
levels.
   
An idea of the sell-off may well be had from the fact that the biggest
gain noted yesterday was of one rupee and lowest 25 paisa.
   
PSO led the list of leading losers, falling by another Rs 11, followed by
PIC and Lever Brothers, which lost Rs 9 and 5. BOC Pakistan, Engro
Chemicals and Telecard lost Rs 2 to 3 on persistent selling.
   
PTCL and Hub-Power, well-known for their stiff resistance to larger
decline, were also marked down by one rupee to Rs 1.20 and so were MNCs,
notably Shell Pakistan and Pakistan Tobacco.
   
Trading volume rose to 38 million shares from the previous 32 million
shares bulk of which went to the credit of ICI Pakistan, off 25 paisa on
11 million shares, followed by Hub-Power, easy Rs 1.20 on 9 million
shares, FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, lower 45 paisa on 4 million shares, and
Dewan Salman, easy 65 paisa on 3.500 million shares.
   
Other actively traded shares were led by Japan Power, off 55 paisa on
0.900 million shares, followed by Engro Chemicals, easy Rs 2 on 0.343
million shares, Schon Bank, lower 55 paisa on 0.300 million shares,
Pakland Cement, unchanged on 0.139 million shares, Bank al-Habib, up 25
paisa on 0.163 million shares, and KESC, off Rs 1.25 on 0.109 million
shares.
   
DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Barring an increase of one rupee in Bolan Casting
on active support at the lower level, all other 16 shares which came in
for trading suffered decline ranging from five to 50 paisa, biggest
decline of 50 paisa being in National Modaraba, which was last quoted at
50 paisa against its face value of Rs 5.
   
Bolan Casting finished at Rs 6 from the previous Rs 5 on a business of
1,000 shares, while Zainab Textiles was marked down by 10 paisa on 3,500
shares.
  
Crescent Spinning was traded unchanged at Rs 6.50 on 4,500 shares. There
was no deal in any other share.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 2: Stock on Monday fell across a broad front under the lead
of pivotals but selling was not that as aggressive as was reflected by
the light traded volume and extremely narrow price movements.
   
But index managed to close above the psychological barrier of 1,700
points at 1,711.81, wiping out early morning fall of 5.29 points thanks
to late selective support by some institutional traders apparently to
demonstrate to the prime minister that the market was in a good shape.
   
The market capitalization also rose from the three-month low level of Rs
526bn to Rs 529bn reflecting the strength of leading base shares in the
afternoon session.
   
Price changes were, however, fractional and reflected that both buyers
and sellers are inclined to maintain a status quo ahead of automated
trading after its inaugural by the prime minister today (Wednesday).
   
The index in the morning session showed an extended fall of 5.29 points
despite Monday evening session's modest recovery of 2.72 points at
1,695.53 as compared to 1,700.82 points a day earlier.
   
Most of the blue chips again led the market decline under the lead of
PSO, Telecard and Lever Brothers falling by Rs 3 to 15 without any large
selling. They were followed by 8th ICP Mutual Fund, Adamjee Insurance,
Nishat Mills, Askari Leasing, Faysal Bank, Glaxo-Wellcome Lab and Dawood
Hercules, which suffered decline ranging from Re 1 to Rs 1.50.
   
Some of the secondliners managed to put on good gains under the lead of
Custodian Modaraba, which rose by Rs 2 and was quoted at Rs 3 against its
face value of Rs 10 on a business of 1,000 shares.
   
Others which recovered modestly were led by Engro Chemicals up Rs 2 and
Kashmir Edible, Diamond Industries, Pakistan Gum Chemicals and Network
Leasing rising by Re 1, each. Volume fell to 29 shares while the gainers
trailed far behind losers at 227 to 60, with 71 shares holding on to the
last levels out of the total 358 actives.
   
The most active list was topped by ICI Pakistan lower 10 paisa on 6m
shares; followed by Hub-Power up 10 paisa on 5.500m shares; FFC-Jordan
fertilizer easy 15 paisa on 1.212m shares; Dewan Salman unchanged on
0.700m shares; and Japan Power, off 15 paisa on 0.246m shares.
   
Other actively traded shares were led by the PTCL which was actively
traded on spot basis and was quoted unchanged at Rs 34.75, reflecting
investor-reluctance to part with their holdings apparently a in
anticipation of an imminent price flare-up on revival of demand at the
lower levels. Dhan Fibre fell 10 paisa on 0.128m shares and Maple Leaf
Cement was easy five paisa on 0.129m shares.
   
Defaulting companies: Trading in the defaulting companies was modest
although some of the investors picked up shares at the current lower
levels. But price changes were fractional in all the shares, which came
in for trading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Intikhab Amir

PESHAWAR, Sept 2: The NWFP government's claim that it recovered Rs 35
million on account of agriculture income tax, during the last financial
year, proved an empty boast when revenue generation under that head
finally stood at just over Rs 5.1 million, according to the official
documents provided to Dawn.
   
Well placed official sources of the provincial government told this
correspondent that the province had recorded massive shortfall on account
of agriculture income tax after the Board of Revenue (BoR), NWFP, the
concerned authority, submitted to the finance department final figures to
the tune of Rs 51,55,288.
   
This is far less than what the provincial government projected in the
1996-97 financial year. Under the revised estimates of the last fiscal
year the provincial government claimed that it recovered a total of Rs 35
million under that head whereas chief minister Mehtab Ahmed Abbasi, who
is also the finance minister, had claimed, in his post-budget press
conference on June 18, that the collection would finally stand at Rs 60
million.
   
The fact is that till June 16, the day the provincial budget was
presented, recoveries under that account had not crossed the four million
figure.

Official documents provided to Dawn show that till May 31 the NWFP
government could collect only Rs 38,06,437 under that head as against the
Rs 35 million projected under the revised estimates of the provincial
budget.

<a name="scri">Scripless trading</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 2: The Karachi Stock Exchange will switch over to scripless
trading from Sept 4, after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif formally
inaugurates the Rs 100m Central Depository System on Sept 3, at an
impressive ceremony to be held to celebrate the historic event.
   
The automated trading system already in practice on trial basis for the
last few months, will get international recognition on Sept 3, putting
the KSE on the list of selected band of fully automated world stock
exchanges.

'The system will, among other allied benefits, will lead to more
transparent share transactions, about which some of the leading foreign
investors have doubts,' stock analysts said adding that 'could well mean
a significant increase in daily volumes.'
   
The work on the project was launched in 1995 under a turn-key assignment
given to the IBM and during the last two years both the KSE authorities
and the IBM personnel have been busy to meet the deadline set for its
formal launching. 'Initially, trading will be a judicious blend of both
automated trading and the decades old open cry system on some of the
counters apparently in bid to allow the system to seek perfection through
trial and error,' said a member of the KSE.
   
The step apparently has been taken to keep busy over 1,000 agents of the
members for some more months until they switch over to other jobs to
avoid unemployment. Under the automated trading system buying and selling
offers are routed through computers and there will be no need of agents
for open cry purposes.
   
Once the system is fully operational, physical handling of shares will be
eliminated as all the transactions will be routed through book entry in
the Central Depository, which will finally assume the role of a share
bank. The active members of the KSE have already set up 900 booths both
in the trading hall and in their offices and have a trained personnel to
handle the job of scripless trading.

Bureau Report
   
ISLAMABAD, Sept 2: The Economic Coordination Committee of the cabinet
which met here on Tuesday decided to close down the Ghee Corporation of
Pakistan, Rice Export Corporation, Utility Stores Corporation and the
Trading Corporation of Pakistan, and directed that the corporations cease
their business activities forthwith.
   
The meeting also decided that liabilities of the GCP, RECP, USC and TCP
would be cleared through the issuance of bonds in the next financial
year.

The suggestion of the finance division to issue bonds to clear the
liabilities of the corporations was approved by the ECC, said Finance
Minister Sartaj Aziz, who presided at the meeting. The bonds would be
issued in 1997-98, he added.
   
The ECC was presented a report on the financial difficulties of GCP,
RECP, USC and TCP and it was also decided that they would no more carry
out business activities. "When they have to be closed down and privatized
why should they continue further business", Sartaj Aziz said.
   
The ECC took up the issues relating to urbanization and decided that the
programme for the upgradation of small and medium-sized towns with growth
potential should be prepared by the provincial governments, which had
originally conceived this idea.

ISLAMABAD, Sept 3: A case has been prepared by the Privatization
Commission (PC) justifying a request from the Muslim Commercial Bank
(MCB) to the government for permission to offload in small tranches, the
24 per cent of shares of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) held by
the bank and other sub-underwriters.
   
The permission, at this juncture, if given is likely to adversely affect
the privatization of the SNGPL, the process which is now in an advanced
stage.
   
The MCB had acted as the lead underwriter for the public offering of
shares of SNGP alongwith a number of sub-underwriters, under a July 1992
contract with the government.
   
Since the issue was highly under subscribed, the MCB alone was left with
the SNGPL shares valuing approximately Rs 950 million (14 per cent)
while, the sub-underwriters were found holding 10 per cent of shares for
which there were no buyers. The total shares of the SNGPL are estimated
to be around 285 million.

KARACHI, Sept 3: Prime Minister Mohammed Nawaz Sharif has advised the
business community to take full advantage of the concessions provided to
them through a package of reforms for the revival of the economy.
   
Reminding them of the responsibility for payment of tax conscientiously
and making use of amnesty for undeclared income through payment of taxes
at the rate of 7.5 per cent, the prime minister warned after the expiry
of the due date the government was determined to move against the tax
evaders on the basis of the data available through the computer system of
the tax administration.
   
Nawaz Sharif was addressing the inaugural ceremony of "Central Depository
System" held in a local hotel on Wednesday under the auspices of the
Central Depository Company of Pakistan Ltd. The elite of the business
community, chiefs of the financial institutions and diplomats attended in
large number.

Behind the podium was moss green banner with the slogan "Pakistan's Stock
Market enters a new age". On its right was seal of the Golden Jubilee of
Pakistan.
   
At the dais Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was flanked by governor Sindh Lt
Gen Moinuddin Haider, finance minister Sartaj Aziz and CDC chief
executive officer Najam Ali on his right while CDC chairman Arif Habib,
CM Sindh Liaquat Ali Jatoi, Corporate Law Authority chairman Shamim Ahmad
Khan, IBM Pakistan chief Nisar Ahmad Memon and MCB chief Mohammed Mansha
Khan on his left.
   
Felicitating the sponsors, CDC, the prime minister said that the system
of custody of shares and their electronic transfer would be serving all
the three stock exchanges and would provide variety of services leading
to increased efficiency and transparency of the market.

Nawaz Sharif reminded the business community of its responsibilities and
asked them to take full advantage of the concessions and initiatives
announced by the government to increase production and expand exports. He
said it was also important that after major changes in tax structure and
system, every one must pay his tax promptly and accurately. The prime
minister further stressed:" Our reform is a continuing process. In the
next few weeks, we would be announcing a new industrial policy in order
to shift the focus of our industrialization from low value added to high
value added industry particularly the export oriented. "One of the
serious setbacks received by Pakistan's economy has been the result of
large scale nationalization in the early seventies which led to
relegation of industrial activity to low value industries."
   
The Prime Minister said that unless during the next few years the country
made rapid progress in hi-tech industries like electronics, engineering
and chemicals, it would not be able to compete in the international
markets in the face of rapid globalization. Government was also
determined to maintain consistency of its policies which was crucial for
sustained economic development.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 3: The Privatization Commission on Wednesday invited
applications for the appointment of a financial adviser for the sale of
National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), an official announcement said.
   
The bank, established under the NBP Ordinance,1949, is one of the largest

<a name="hblt">HBL to extend time period for golden handshake</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter
   
KARACHI, Sept 5: The time period for accepting the golden handshake will
reportedly be extended up to Sept 15 during which some adjustments will
be made for workers' benefits, according to reliable sources in the
banking sector.
   
Inquiries show that there are serious concerns amongst the HBL's senior
staff, who joined the bank before 1975. They are of the view that under
the old gratuity option of provident fund, they would be deprived of
hundreds of thousands of rupees compared to the employees availing of the
new pension scheme.
   
Under the golden handshake offered by the HBL, the old gratuity option is
to be calculated on the basis of self-contribution and the bank's
contribution, with gratuity assessed as basic salary at the time of
retirement divided by the length of service. Since most of HBL's
employees had been unprepared for the golden handshake, having expected
to retire at 60 years, they will be receiving considerably less than if
they had retired on schedule.
   
The new retirement benefit scheme is based on the employee's own
contribution to service, with pension to be calculated on the basis of
basic pay divided by seven, divided by length of service, divided by 300
multiplied by 2.
   
Although HBL employees who had joined in 1975 were in a position to avail
of the new scheme, the new pension benefits were reportedly twice offered
to the older employees as well. However, being unprepared for the golden
handshake, they had not availed of the scheme at that time.
   
A delegation of bank union employees led by Habib Bank Workers Front
president Habibuddin Junaidi had met the president Shaukat Tarin on Sept
1.

The delegation had told the president that since most-senior employees,
aged 55-60 years would opt for the golden handshake, they would be the
losers under the old gratuity scheme.
   
According to Mr. Junaidi, while the bank president is reportedly not
reconsidering changing the old gratuity option for senior HBL employees,
he was reportedly considering reframing the medical policy on the golden
handshake. While the previous policy gives monthly ceiling on three basic
salaries for 10 years for a final settlement, Mr. Tarin was acknowledged
to have recognized the "human problem" this would create for retiring
employees.
   
Consequently, the HBL is reportedly considering changing the medical
option provided in its golden handshake in favour of providing monthly
medicines, with coverage for prolonged illness and surgery for life, as
it would have under the usual retirement scheme.
   
In response to the demands raised by the banking workers, the bank
president is also reportedly revising its benevolent scheme to give a
better offer to executives and officers. Furthermore, as a result of the
pressure from bank union employees, the HBL is also reported to be
reconsidering it original leaves policy in the golden handshake policy,
which had allowed for encashment of only up to six month of leaves.
   
Under the improved scheme for workers, the HBL is reportedly considering
allowing the total encashment of outstanding leaves for employees opting
for the golden handshake.

<a name="thel">The legless chair</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

"THE main function of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee
during peacetime will be planning for the defence of the country,
including planning of war. He will not interfere with, or give directives
to, the Services about their normal function nor will he exercise any
executive authority in time of peace....
   
"In peacetime, where there is diversion of views among the Chiefs of
Staff, and the Committee is unable to agree, the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Committee will present the alternatives, as formulated
during discussions and give his advice to the Defence Minister for his
decision." (White Paper on Higher Defence rganization, issued by the
Ministry of Defence, Islamabad, May 11, 1976).
   
And should war be upon us: "During war (declared or undeclared), when the
Prime Minister has informed the nation that the country is at war or
facing a war-like situation, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee
will assume responsibilities as Principal Staff Officer to assist the
Prime Minister (Defence Minister) in the supervision and conduct of war
and as overall coordinator to the extent authorized specifically in that
behalf by the Prime Minister who will continue to exercise Supreme
Command over the Forces... During war the Chairman JCSC will have to take
decisions as authorized by the Defence Minister." (White Paper...).
   
That is to say that the Chairman will play golf in peacetime, and caddy
for the Prime Minister should we find ourselves at war.
   
The legless chair upon which to seat the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff Committee was first conceived in 1975 by the then prime minister,
doubling as defence minister, with the sole purpose of its acting as a
perch for senior military officers who were to be sidelined by an upward
shunt, or by those who he hoped he would be able to manipulate to conform
with his mind-set. The creation of the Higher Defence Organization (HDO)
was announced to the nation by the prime minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
during his broadcast of December 20, 1975, the fourth anniversary of his
assumption of supreme power in Pakistan. It was said that the HDO "takes
into account the historical setting, experiences, and the national
temperament of Pakistan." This temperament, after a lapse of 50 years,
still has to be even vaguely defined.
   
Ever afraid of the only disciplined party in the country, and the
largest, the army, Zulfikar declared that "the government is confident
that the new organization will not only provide the country with an
efficient machinery but will also secure an effective civilian supremacy
which is in consonance with the nation's paramount aim."
   
In the latter part of 1975, Bhutto having noticed the obsequious bowing
and scraping of the sixth down the line, Lt General Zia-ul-Haq, and
having considered him totally servile and incapable of holding a
divergent view, let alone even dreaming of turfing him out and taking
over the country, made up his mind to make him his army chief. To do this
he had to ignominiously shunt into a siding the much senior and more
competent Lt-General Mohammed Shariff. He did this, on March 1, 1976, by
promoting him and appointing him as his first Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff Committee.
   
The legless chair was occupied by General Shariff until he retired, after
the fall of Zulfikar, whereafter Admiral Mohammed Sharif, then Zia's
Chief of Naval Staff, officiated as Chairman until April 13, 1980, when
Zia's friend, General Mohammed Iqbal Khan, was sent to sit in it. Iqbal
was followed on March 22, 1984, by Zia's other close friend General
Rahimuddin. He made way on March 29, 1987, for the super-rich General
Akhtar Abdur Rahman Khan of ISI fame who left this world with Zia in the
skies over Bahawalpur.
   
He was succeeded by retired CNS Admiral Iftikhar Ahmad Sirohey, appointed
Chairman on November 10, 1988. General Shamim Alam Khan, never to be
COAS, followed him on November 10, 1991, and on November 10, 1994, came
the present incumbent retired CAS Air Chief Marshal Farooq Feroze Khan.
   
The high-sounding Chairman can only do what he is told to do by his boss.

Apart from serving no useful purpose, he, his commodious chair, his
accouterment, his staff, their houses, their rest houses, their travels
and world tours, their privileges and their perks all cost us a great
deal.

They consume funds and manpower that could be far better used. The
running of his organization, its offices, training establishment and
college, and the jaunts and joyrides in which he and his men indulge
themselves has cost the nation an average of Rs 100 million per year.
This means that so far, from 1976 to 1997, over Rs 2 billion has been
squandered, Rs 2 billion that could have been put to some useful purpose
for the benefit o the people of the country.
   
Up to 1976, before Zulfikar for his own purposes decided that something
more was needed, there was what was known as a Joint Chiefs Committee,
served by a Joint Chiefs Secretariat headed by a Chairman appointed from
amongst the three service chiefs. It served its purpose, and for almost
thirty years of the country's life was considered to be sufficient.
Farooq Feroze's term expires this year on November 9. Would it not be
prudent to disband his organization at this time and revert to economic
simplicity?

Downsizing has to be done; it is now essential.
   
We know that the first priority of our leaders is to amass power and
pelf, and the second priority to amass more power and more pelf, and that
all they pray for, day and night, is that they remain in power for ever
and ever. When we talk of reality - the safety and security of the
people's lives and property, the 40 million who live in absolute poverty,
the 70 million without access to health facilities, the 100 million
illiterate - the voice of the government from Islamabad says that we are
countering government rhetoric with emotionalism. When defence is
discussed, it is purely in terms of more spending, more money-making
deals.
   
Nawaz Sharif is so evidently on a power-consolidating binge. His
constitutional amendments and his acts manifestly prove it. He is out to
destroy the independence of the judiciary. Why else would he reduce the
number of Supreme Court judges? This has been done merely to block the
passage of those recommended for elevation by the Chief Justice who
either would not suit his purposes in the Supreme Court or whom he would
miss in their respective High Courts. This undermining of this vital
institution must be resisted.
   
Then, observe how Chapter 2 of our Constitution dealing with the armed
forces has been chopped and chipped by three leaders for their own
expediency.
   
Article 243, "Command of the Armed Forces", originally read: "(1)

The Federal Government shall have control and command of the Armed
Forces."
   
Zia added: "(1A) Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing
provision, the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces shall vest in the
President."
   
Clause (2) of Article 243 originally read: "The President shall, subject
to law, have power:
   
"(a) to raise and maintain the Military, Naval and Air Forces of
Pakistan; and the Reserves of such Forces;
   
"(b) to grant Commissions in such Forces; and

"(c) to appoint the Chief of the Army Staff, the Chief of the Naval
Staff, and the chief of the Air Staff, and determine their salaries and
allowances."
   
Zia added in (2) (c), after the word "appoint": "in his discretion, the
Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee".
   
By his 13th Amendment, hurriedly passed without debate, Nawaz Sharif has
changed Zia's clause (2) (c) to omit the words "in his discretion."  So,
we now have a Supreme Commander, the President, a Tumandar no less, who
is content to remain subservient and powerless, and a prime minister who
has acquired his power but has omitted to constitutionalize the fact. An
incongruous situation.
   
One must now suppose that Nawaz Sharif will swiftly consult his legal
adviser and think about rushing through another amendment, after
suspending the rules of business, and after the lily-livered opposition
has staged another 'walk out' instead of holding their ground and
recording their reasons for either agreement or dissent.
   
We, the 140 million, can only blame ourselves for the worsening
situation, for allowing a one-party system to take root, further
endorsing fascism.

<a name="epid">Epidemic of despair</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

I WENT to Islamabad last week and as I entered the Jinnah Airport
terminal building, an announcement was blaring out over the public
address system that was cautioning/warning/ threatening all and sundry
that smoking was strictly forbidden in the airport building. When I got
on board the aircraft (it was three hours late) we were informed that
smoking was banned on all domestic flights.
   
I presume that this ban is in the public interest, a concern for the
health of the people. No one can fault this. But will it make people give
up smoking? If the idea is to keep the airport building and the aircraft
free from the pollution of cigarette smoke, it merely papers over the
cracks because on the way to the airport one breathes air so foul that it
is the equivalent of smoking ten packets of cigarettes.
   
The solution clearly is to catch them young, before they light up their
first cigarette and get hooked. It may be too late for those who are
hooked. They may give up the habit on the advice of their doctors. But
clearly we need to target those who have not yet taken up the habit.
Simply put, prevention is better than cure. I myself took up cigarette
smoking to show off to myself that I had grown up. It was the sort of
ego-thing. I smoked surreptiously because I knew my father would murder
me if he found out. Thus there was the thrill of conspiracy, all very
foolish reasons.
   
I am sure that had there been this vigorous anti-smoking campaign in
those days, if the glamour had been taken out, I would not have lit up.
In other words, we should remove the inducements. Tobacco companies
maintain that their advertisements and their sponsorship of sports do not
encourage the young to take up smoking. Why then are they spending
millions and millions all over the world? All advertising is a come-on, a
selling proposition.
   
But that is the least of our problems, that is to say, when we are
confronted with the staggering and horrendous figures that there are 5.6
million drug addicts in the country and the number is increasing. It is
further claimed that the addicts are consuming 16,500 kg of heroin
daily.
   
I think we need to ponder over these figures, understand that we are
dealing with an epidemic and then feel very concerned and get very
alarmed. The problem or the disease has to be addressed two-fold. First
there is the easy availability of drugs. This is clearly a failure of
law-enforcement agencies. The inability to stop pushers. But far more
important, we must address the despair that turns people into junkies.
What sorrows are they trying to drown? What strains are they trying to
remove? What hell are they escaping from that makes them want to enter a
different kind of hell? Surely not a better hell.
   
One reads of the intensification of efforts to prevent the smuggling of
heroin from Pakistan. We read too reports each day of some passengers
being apprehended at airports with drugs concealed in their baggage. This
is as it should be. There are international obligations to meet. Pakistan
is already known as the largest exporter of heroin in the world. But what
about the smuggling of heroin into Pakistan? That heroin that is meant
for domestic consumption? After all these 5.6 million addicts get their
heroin from dealers and pushers in this country. What efforts are being
made to dry up this supply?
   
But most of all we need to look at the demand side. Why do people, the
young in particular, turn to heroin? It is a fact of life that heroin
addicts are to be found among the poorer sections of society. There is,
therefore, a direct connection between drug addiction and quality of
life. This is true all over the world. The vast majority of junkies are
to be found in the inner cities, among slum dwellers and those who live
on the margins and the sharp corners of life. Not all the policing and
the vigilance will be able to stop drug addiction unless the reasons why
people turn to drugs are removed. Sniffing cocaine may have been the
in-thing and a status symbol among the glitterati of the Western world.
But it no longer is. Now it is seen as a sickness.
   
While dealing and pushing drugs should be considered a criminal activity,
the addicts must not be treated as criminals. They are victims of an
unjust society that has made their lives so desperate that they will
cling to anything that will provide them some temporary relief, even if,
in the long run and the not-so long run, it may kill them.
   
We must consider too that not so long ago, there was not a single heroin
addict in this country. What factors led to the present epidemic of 5.6
million heroin addicts? Clearly there were external factors that colluded
with internal forces. The first advanced their geopolitical agenda and
the second enriched themselves. It was an unholy alliance. When we are
sternly lectured about the export of heroin by our friends, we need to
remind them that they were our original partners in this crime!  Social
psychologists and behavioural scientists will be able to identify the
causes of drug addition. The law-enforcement agencies will point to the
efforts they are making to eliminate this menace. But that is getting us
nowhere for research shows that the numbers are increasing which means
that the problem is getting worse. If we are to avoid a national
disaster, obviously some major action will be required. But first of all
we must accept that we are standing precariously on the edge of a
precipice.

<a name="lear">Learning from the past</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Gen Khalid Mahmud Arif (retd)

THE Golden Jubilee year of Pakistan's independence (August 1997)
justifies self-approbation and self-reproach. The national gains and
losses during this five-decade long period may be comprehensively and
objectively analyzed to learn from our acts of omission and commission
and to plan for a better future. First, the past.
   
Ancient India was neither Hindu nor Muslim. It existed much before the
light of Islam radiated fourteen hundred years ago or Hinduism spread in
India about six hundred years before the birth of the holy Prophet
(PBUH). The case of India's physical identity is also similar. Its
existing geographic unity is a recent phenomenon. Culturally old but
politically young, the India of distant past was a land of paradoxes, a
bunch of kingdoms and mini-states of varying and frequently changing
sizes, each enjoying a modicum of sovereignty.
   
India was never a united country. Its national unity was largely forged
during periods of Muslim and British rules. Even then 563 princely states
existed in India at the time of its independence in 1947. The emergence
of current India out of immense diversity is writ large in its
composition and behaviour. The fissiparous tendencies and the regional
pulls that keep surfacing here and there in the country are the result of
the rich cultural and social heritage of its various regions which are
highly proud and deeply sensitive of their distinct identity, developed
languages and
fascinating history.
   
"India is a Hindu country," declares L.K. Advani of the BJP, adding, "it
may be multi-lingual, multi-religious and multi-racial but its culture is
one. The culture is Hinduism." This rings an alarm bell in a country that
claims to be a secular state. The Muslims feared the risk of this culture
being imposed on them by the extremist majority in case partition had not
materialized in 1947.
   
The emergence of Pakistan not only enabled its people to live in
accordance with their own ways of life but also imposed a check on India
to treat its minorities fairly. True, this moral pressure was neither
strong nor effective but without it the plight of the minorities in India
might have been worse. The Hindu fundamentalists maintain a highly
offensive posture. Bal Thackray had arrogantly announced during the
premeditated Bombay Massacre in 1992, "Forget the government. No Allah
will save the Muslims here." India's media claimed that over 2000 Muslims
were killed in Bombay now renamed as Mumbai. Bal Thackray remains
unpunished in "secular" India.
   
The past five decades gave freedom, identity and self-respect to the
people of Pakistan that defy quantification in mathematical terms. This
gain outweighs all other considerations. The delight of being the masters
of their own destiny is better known to those who have faced the pangs of
slavery. We are not second-rate citizens in our own state, a phenomenon
not uncommon in some countries. We availed many other mundane benefits.
These might not have been spectacular but realism demands that we judge
ourselves from where we started.
   
In 1947, India's economy was largely under the control of the Hindu
community. It dominated sectors such as industry, trade, commerce,
banking, exports and imports, and agriculture. The Muslim share in these
sectors was small. So also was the case in the social sectors - health,
education, transport, medical care, housing etc. Pakistan inherited
backward areas virtually void of industrial infrastructure. For strategic
reasons the industrial complexes in the undivided India were located far
away from the traditional land invasion routes to India from the west.
Additionally, the border areas were kept undeveloped to provide manpower
for the armed forces of the British Raj.
   
Despite such handicaps Pakistan has laid the foundations of a fairly firm
industrial base to reach a take-off stage. This is an impressive success
story. As a nation we did not exploit our full potential and mismanaged
our affairs. Our rich and talented demographic resource was not harnessed
to its optimum ability. Pakistan, a perfectly fine and robust country,
has been let down by its greedy and incompetent leadership.
   
Our downward slide is a painful story. Painful, because we lost East
Pakistan and despite this shock this land of the pure was judged last
year as the second most corrupt country in the world. Its national riches
were mercilessly siphoned off to the personal accounts of the policy
makers and their accomplices in a grand national loot. Banks were used as
instruments of state coercion to punish political opponents. The bank
loans were given to the privileged few without adequate securities, with
the full connivance of the bank authorities. Many defaulted. Some loans
were written off.
  
Democracy was derailed. The politicians blame the generals for entering
the political field seen off-limits to them. The generals chide the
politicians for making a mockery of democracy and creating the conditions
that endangered national security. The judiciary excelled in delays and
gave controversial judgments. The octopus of bureaucracy kept creeping
its tentacles and accumulating authority, and lately wealth, under its
wings. The constitution-making was delayed. When made, it was soon
upturned for valid and invalid reasons. The resultant confusion and
uncertainty retarded national progress.
   
Some political parties, loud in democratic rhetoric, are autocratic from
within. Internal elections are foreign to them. The nominated office
bearers dutifully "elect" their party chiefs. Such parties are treated by
their lords as their fiefs. Pakistan's body politic suffers from the
cancer of dynasty controlled political parties. The assemblies are
dominated by a mixed bag of literate and semi-literate rural gentry and
brief-less lawyers who are opposed to any reforms that may erode their
grip on the legislatures. Ayub's land reforms were largely frustrated by
this powerful land Mafia.
   
It is a rebuke to our sagacity that our political parties aided, abetted
and prompted defection of legislators for reasons of tactical gains.
Mercifully, an anti-defection law was made a part of the Constitution in
1997, a full fifty years after gaining independence. Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's government and the opposition deserve credit for this
achievement. This belated maturity is a positive development.
   
The parliamentary system suits our law makers because it provides them
lollipops in the administration. The jumbo size cabinets and battalions
of advisors have frequently flourished in the past at the cost of the tax
payers' money. A constitutional limit may be fixed for the maximum size
of the federal and the provincial cabinets. Likewise, we may downsize the
federal and the provincial governments by forty per cent. The removal of
fat will promote efficiency and save avoidable expenses.
   
The country needs land reforms. The Indian model may be useful. All state
lands, stud lands and Jagirs etc. granted in the past for the services
rendered for the British Crown may be immediately resumed. The supporting
laws may be speedily enacted before the time runs out for such acts. In
the interregnum an agricultural tax be levied on all agricultural
incomes.
   
The failure of our archaic education system is writ large by our low
literacy rate and linguistic-cum-ethnic pressures on the society. A
uniform syllabus in all the educational institutions in the country is
the dire need of the time to promote national cohesion. So is the need
for a joint electorate for the assemblies to achieve greater internal
unity. The system of separate electorate has long run its course. The
country needs internal peace. It has suffered violence for too long.
   
A comprehensive and a bold economic package may avert the present
economic crisis. Bhutto's nationalization policy in the mid-seventies was
a monumental blunder. It destroyed the national economy and checked the
industrial progress made during the Ayub era. The bold and innovative
decisions taken in 1997 may be firmly implemented. Our labour laws are
defective. The right of hire and fire may be restored with sufficient
safeguards against excesses committed by the employers and the employees.
The trade union activity should be healthy, constructive, legal and
peaceful.
  
We have learnt at our cost the need to discover a new wealth of wisdom to
upgrade national institutions and downgrade personalities howsoever
mighty they may be. Civilian dictators are as bad as the military
dictators can be. Reject both. No system can survive if the deviators
keep thriving in it. We may ruthlessly and fairly get rid of the dirty
fish to clean our national political pond. The first fifty years of our
independence have ended in a confusion. We are down and under but not
without a lesson. Let a new equilibrium emerge out of this confusion to
fertilize our minds for a better future. The government has the requisite
majority and the public mandate to show tangible results. This chance has
come only once in the last five decades. Will we avail or lose it remains
to be seen.

<a name="unce">Uncertain outlook for dialogue</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
M.H. Askari

THE fate of India-Pakistan relations seems to be interminably suffering
from uncertainty: when the government on either of the two sides is too
sure of itself, it seems to feel little compulsion to work towards
normalisation, and when it is not strong, it does not feel confident
enough to take a bold initiative and risk its survival.
   
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif won the last elections with an unusually
large voter support and would appear to be in a position to carry the
entire nation with him but Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral, on the
other side of the divide, is perched on top of a 13-party coalition
representing mainly a broad range of regional parties and is not too sure
when the carpet may be pulled from under his feet. To make matters worse,
the domestic situation in both countries continues to be unpredictable;
in Pakistan because of the economic mess and the factional divisiveness
and in India because of the rising tide of Hindu chauvinism which
threatens the secular platform of the coalition partners of the United
Front.
   
The net result is that the hard-liners on both sides appear to be
confident that they can obstruct the process of normalization to which
otherwise both Messrs Nawaz Sharif and Gujral stand committed. It was not
too long that the fog of uncertainty seemed to be clearing and the
outlook for a meaningful dialogue to resolve all bilateral issues looked
fairly bright. After two rounds of talks the foreign secretaries of the
two governments seemed agreed on a common agenda. However, at the time of
writing, the prospects for a third round again appear to be befogged.
   
Even more enigmatically, the Indian prime minister has come up with an
unusual demand, that in his proposed meeting with the US President later
this month there should be no discussion on India-Pakistan relations and
Washington appears to have yielded to the pressure. It is an established
protocol that at any summit meeting, leaders of two countries engage
themselves in a tour d'horizon  which in practical terms means a review
of the current situation in all areas of common interest, especially of
developments in their respective regions which can impinge on their
bilateral relations and matters of mutual interest.
   
It would be naive to deny that the stability of the region and relations
between Pakistan and India have throughout the fifty years since the
subcontinent secured its independence been of considerable concern to
Washington. Mr. Gujral's insistence upon leaving any reference to
India-Pakistan relations out of the agenda of his talks with President
Clinton is therefore both unrealistic and unreasonable. If the position
that he has taken is meant to convey to his own people that he would not
accept any pressure from the US president, he could have been more
specific and not mystify the situation for the policy-makers in Pakistan.
Mr. Nawaz Sharif has demonstrated an admirable level of political
maturity by not making the issue a subject of public debate, having
abstained from coming out with any rejoinder to the statements of his
counterpart in New Delhi.
   
There has been a persistent feeling that the resumption of the bilateral
talks between India and Pakistan in recent months has to a great extent
resulted from American interest in using its good offices. It is possible
that Islamabad may have felt the pressure from Washington more than India
has because of the critical economic problems that it faces and the heavy
dependence upon IMF and the World Bank which are institutions used by
Washington to promote its own foreign policy and not for the altruistic
purpose of rescuing nations which happen to be in economic distress. New
Delhi, too, is under strong political and economic pressure, to a large
extent because of the Kashmir situation and would presumably not be
averse to accepting outside help in restoring peace and calm in the
region.
   
Mr. Gujral is also fully aware of the serious nature of the social and
political problems that his government faces with escalating pressure
from the regions to free themselves from the control of the centre.
Kashmir, because of the extreme militancy that it has suffered for the
past ten years and the deep mistrust of New Delhi's designs by the
Kashmiri people, is the major challenge confronting the Indian
government.
   
The Kashmir issue is undeniably the major hurdle in the way of
normalization of relations between Pakistan and India and the seminar
held under the auspices of the University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir in
Muzzafarabad on August 24-25 did a great deal to place the problem in its
proper perspective from the point of view of the Kashmiris. At the end of
the seminar it was clear that the political leaders and opinion-makers on
the western side of the LoC in Kashmir feel deeply anguished at the
international community's apathetic attitude but in no sense feel
despondent about the ultimate outcome of the Kashmiri people's armed
struggle against the Indian security force.
   
Even though the seminar spent a disportionately great deal of time
reviewing the events of the past - what may now be called history - the
message that it wished to convey to the outside world was that the
Kashmiri people would not yield on their basic demand of
self-determination. Unfortunately, what remained unclear was how, and how
soon, would the ultimate goal would become a reality, especially if
recourse to an outside power, such as the US for mediation or for
facilitating the negotiations for peace is to be ruled out.
   
Several of the speakers at the seminar, including Mr. Yusuf Buch,
probably the most seasoned expert on the Kashmir problem, and Mr. Abdul
Sattar, former foreign secretary and former caretaker foreign minister,
did not seem to place much faith in the good offices of the US. Mr. Buch
left no doubt that, in his opinion, the US is "a status quo power, par
excellence" and it viewed with suspicion any "movement that seeks to
change an existing dispensation unless that change is perceived to be
necessary for a defined American interest." (emphasis added).
   
Mr. Sattar suggested that India's projection of the Kashmiri freedom
fighters as Islamic fundamentalists may have been a factor with the US
threatening in 1992 to place Pakistan on its list of terrorist states.
He, however, disclosed that it was as a result of "preventive diplomacy"
by the US that averted the danger of pre-emptive air strikes against
Pakistan recommended by Indian military planners in 1990. He nevertheless
expressed the view that the US being "disinclined to displease India",
tended to equate the Kashmiri fighters with terrorists, "equating
(India's) state terrorism with acts of freedom fighters."
   
It cannot be said that the seminar reached any clear conclusions which
would suggest a way out of the stalemated situation in Kashmir. Despite
the large-scale repression and brutalities committed on the Kashmiri
people, it would be too optimistic to suggest that the freedom fighters
by themselves would within a predictable time-frame be able to attain
their goal of azadi. Several of the speakers seemed to place too much
trust in the UN's will to implement its resolutions which the Security
Council adopted nearly fifty years ago.
   
Stressing the chaotic conditions and the nascent breakaway movements in
many parts of India, Prof. Aftab Ahmad of Bangladesh maintained that the
UN and the world powers, specially the US now had the opportunity "to
redefine the strategic priorities of the region vis-a-vis the aspirations
of the people." He perhaps placed too much faith in the sense of morality
of the Western countries when he suggested that the Kashmir issue was
part of the "unsettled business" of the 1947 partition and it was high
time that the international community discharged its responsibilities to
the Kashmiri people.  A more pragmatic approach to the problem was
suggested by Mir Abdul Aziz, a prominent Kashmiri writer and one of the
pioneers of the Kashmiri people's liberation movement, in a private
conversation with this writer. He proposed that the Kashmir issue could
be settled step by step and the first step should be the abolition of the
LoC giving the Kashmiri people on both sides the opportunity for free
interaction and contacts, especially in the economic field. He believed
that tensions would defuse once the Kashmiri people had free access to
their kith and kin in both parts of the disputed state and help to
reintegrate their economic activity. He felt that economic activity in
the Indian held Kashmir would start picking up once this happened and
that this would greatly mitigate the hardships of the Kashmiri people on
the other side of the divide.
   
Surprisingly, many of the speakers at the seminar suggested that Pakistan
should upgrade its help to the Kashmiri freedom fighters, and proposed
that the assistance to the freedom fighters should not be confined to
moral and diplomatic but also include material support. The ramifications
of such a move can be altogether unpredictable and lead to escalation of
the fighting beyond the borders of the state. At a time when Pakistan is
faced with innumerable domestic economic and political problems it is
doubtful whether this would be the wisest course for Pakistan to
choose.
   
Somewhat unexpectedly, it was a military participant of the seminar,
retired Major-General Nishat Ahmad, President of Islamabad's nstitute of
Regional Studies, who stressed that Kashmir was a political problem and
that there could only be a political solution to it. He agreed with what
he called the counsel of Pakistan's "friends" who believed that the
country should concentrate on its economic development and reduce the
burden of high defence expenditure. However, it had to be recognized that
this could not be done unilaterally by Pakistan which had been the victim
of Indian aggression more than once.
   
As a military man, Gen. Nishat Ahmad did not mince his words and said in
a forthright manner: "My sincere suggestion to our neighbors is that they
cannot keep a people subjugated permanently through use of force." He
then went on to declare: "Let us mutually reduce the deployment of forces
in Kashmir drastically and allow free inter-action between the people of
Kashmir; this will perhaps enable us to chart a new course which may not
be visible or not acceptable at the moment."
   
These words clearly seemed to echo what Mir Abdul Aziz told this writer
privately. Is there anybody listening in New Delhi?

<a name="just">Just so much garbage</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Rifaat Hamid Ghani

SOME of Karachi's garbage disposal equipment has been dispatched to
Hyderabad in connection with a cleanliness drive there. Obviously,
cleanliness is considered a short-term project there for the quipment to
be on loan. What happens to Karachi while it's away and what happens to
Hyderabad once it is returned?
   
If memory serves right, it took several months to clear some garbage
disposal and collection trucks from the port - the ones that had een
gifted to Karachi. It could take Hyderabad some years before its ans are
ordered or donated and then cleared and sent on. But then all of us are
used to living with garbage. Somebody voiced the opinion that nobody in
Karachi would notice the absence of the equipment because it has been so
long since the city has had a cleaner face. Still there are degrees of
filth that have to be taken into account. Wading through garbage one foot
deep would be worse than wading through a thinner layer of it. Think of
Empress Market: even the bus drivers have problems negotiating the litter
ridden, rutted patches there.
   
There is one thing to be said in favor of garbage accumulation in
Karachi. It is not subject to class. Garbage collects everywhere. Defence
and KDA and Clifton have their problems with the polythene bags and
conspicuous consumption makes the household garbage accumulation in some
affluent areas exceptionally high. Maybe one day our civic authorities
will have mastered the concept that it is not enough to collect garbage
from one point simply to dump it elsewhere near by. We need garbage
disposal not transference. And what about recycling? One hears a lot
about it these days but only as a conceptual desirability.
   
Urban development has been curious in Karachi. The city expanded without
a thought as to the provision of a civic infrastructure. But now, even in
areas where there once was an infrastructure of sorts and the basic civic
services were functional, things have changed. Poor maintenance has taken
its toll. Sometimes a kunda is more reliable than the conventional
connection and cheaper to boot. Tankers have to supplement the water that
pipe connections provide. The ones who matter in our society are
beginning to realize that something has to be done to expand the
infrastructure and maintain it, otherwise even they will cease to be
served.
   
When it comes to using jargon though we have progressed by leaps and
bounds. We are supposed to enter the twenty-first century with a bang not
a whimper and there are slogans to match. The catchphrase for health was
health care for all but the new millennium is about two years down the
road. A friend who indulges in the luxury of civic consciousness is still
not going in for purified bottled water in the home because it is too
expensive to provide it for the servants as well and it makes him gulp to
say: that's your water, and this is mine. But even with the best will in
the world, how much can he or anyone else do in a private capacity to
improve the lot of their domestic help? In more general terms they remain
deprived.
   
To take just one example: the man in the street's favorite remedy is an
injection from the doctor or a glucose drip when feeling low. To be
taking a mere Aspirin seems like stinting on their health. What the
less-than-sterile drips and syringes may be doing to public health is
something the privileged will only feel a sense of urgency about when the
consequences begin to threaten them too and the problem has become too
enormous to be dealt with easily or effectively.

<a name="whyt">Why this needless, draconian law?</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi
   
THE president has issued an order to reduce the number of judges in the
Supreme Court of Pakistan to just twelve from the present strength of 17.
It is not known whether he has done it under any of the remaining Eighth
Amendment powers or he was acting on the advice of the cabinet through
the law ministry.
   
In the given background it is to be presumed that he seems to have been
working on the cabinet advice. Thus, if any blame has to attach to this
reduction in the apex court strength and effectiveness, or its ability to
discharge its duties efficiently, the responsibility must rest with the
federal government.
   
As it happens, the whole country is reverberating with rumors of a
serious divergence of opinion between the government of Mian Nawaz Sharif
and the superior judiciary in general and the Chief Justice of Pakistan
in particular over the new act to counter terrorism. None of it seems
groundless. The senior members of the bar and the bench, along with all
liberal opinion in the country, regard this as a black law. It is this
background that makes the presidential order suspect. In any case, what
is certain is that reducing the strength of the top court at a time when
a huge backlog of work remains to be cleared can only reduce the
effectiveness and the ability of the apex court to complete its work in
reasonable time.
   
That this goes against the grain of what the PM and the members of his
government claim to want to ensure for the people: inexpensive and
expeditious justice. Here is the government ensuring that there would now
be even more delays in disposing of important cases that go up to the SC.
This would be paradoxical were it not for the background of serious
personal divergences of opinion between the government and the superior
judiciary. In the given circumstances all human rights organizations and
liberals will definitely side with the judiciary and hold the government
wrong and culpable for an action both arbitrary and thoughtless. This is
a question on which to stay neutral or unconcerned will amount to a
dereliction of a citizen's duty toward society and his own conscience.
   
The proper thing for an aware citizen is to sound the alarm over the
government's state of mind. It is giving way under the strain of the
sectarian warfare now going on mainly in Punjab and in its panic it is
rushing to arm the police with such sweeping powers that threaten the
very basis of a civilized existence. One is not necessarily accusing the
government of bad or anti-democratic intentions, though this is not a
case where any benefit of the doubt can or should be given to the
government. As a general rule where citizens' rights are involved, this
benefit should go to those who may be complaining against an executive's
high-handedness - its gradual tilt towards authoritarianism.
   
The root cause of the discord between the judiciary and the government -
incidentally a recurrent theme in the country's turbulent political
history - was the recent anti-terrorism law. The PM somehow appears firm
on this sort of approach while, true to his salt, the CJ, and indeed any
member of the judiciary, could possibly be happy. Thus the PM and his
government seems to fear that SC, or even a high court, might strike down
this law just as soon as an opportunity presents itself. The fear may not
be unjustified. All honor to our judges for the government to entertain
such fears about their conduct. One only hopes that the senior judges
will make the official fears come true.
   
There is simply nothing to be said in government's defence, except to ask
for understanding: it appears panic-stricken and does not know anything
better. What all liberals must remind it is that it should take an
appraising look at the police forces at its command. Does any sane
citizen trust them either for their conduct or intent. The government
leaders fail to remember what they have seen, and occasionally
experienced when in opposition, that all previous governments have used
the police for questionable political purposes. Secondly, the police,
when given an inch, have taken a foot. Look at the record of the Sindh
Police. Gen Babar seemed to have ordered a certain number of suspects to
be dealt with in a certain manner and it went berserk and did what so
many judges and courts are still seized of. The record of the Punjab
Police in mistreating citizens and staging fake encounters and rapes in
police custody, etc, is not too dissimilar to that of its Sindh
counterpart.
   
Can such police forces be trusted with sweeping powers? Ask any citizen
of Sindh or a newspaper reader of Lahore and he would tell you. And how
wide-ranging these powers are that have been lately conferred upon the
police forces? A policeman can shoot to kill a person whom he suspects
that he is likely to commit a terrorist act. He can enter any house
without a search warrant, if he just suspects that it harbours a
terrorist or a would-be terrorist or illegal arms at any time on his own
authority. Then, the kind of expeditiousness - timeframes for completion
of this or that function or process - that the act envisages in
administering justice militates against all time-tested cannons of
justice. One feels proud of one's judiciary for insisting on doing full,
not partial or hurried, justice.
   
It is to be hoped that all the liberal-minded people, not just the human
rights activists and organization, would rally round the judiciary
full-throatedly and some public-spirited citizens should file writs with
superior courts for getting this obnoxious law struck down. It is not
that one is unmindful of the evil that sectarian and religious
intolerance can do or are doing. This certainly has to be tackled and
most urgently. But the nation does not have to be panic-stricken like the
government.

Retaining poise and commonsense, let the subject be intensively
discussed, giving due weight to the views of those who are simply not
carried away by any prejudice or whose ability to be tolerant is known.
   
The prime minister and his government will do themselves credit if they
go by the precedent of their own party leader of yore - Mohammad Khan
Junejo - to consult the entire intelligentsia in a proper manner.
  
Let them not hot-heatedly rush into thoughtless action that can badly
backfire, without solving any problem. Let them not create bigger
problems for themselves and for the country.

<a name="pace">Pacer Akram selected for Sahara Cup</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, Sept 1: The tall and lanky Test paceman Muhammad Akram, rated
highly by experts due to his control over length and direction and fiery
pace and who had the honor to represent Northamptonshire during this
English cricket season nearing its end, stages a comeback into the
Pakistan senior cricket team.
   

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive Majid Khan told this
reporter in an exclusive meeting on Monday afternoon that the selectors
recommended the name of Muhammad Akram to fill the 14th slot in the
Toronto-bound Pakistan cricket team. That would leave for Canada on the
10th of this month and take part in the second Sahara Cup Cricket series
against the Indian side from the 13th. The Indian team has also been
already chosen.
   
In fact, the 14 players of the Pakistan cricket team for the series had
been picked much before the Indian team was finalized. However, the PCB
Council had to drop young paceman Shoaib Akhtar on the day of its meeting
(August 23). That very day a facsimile message was received from the
Pakistan "A" cricket team manager Justice Ijaz Yousaf, who  had
complained  about "misbehaviour" of the youngster during the tour of
Britain and advised not to include him in the Pakistan squad despite the
fact that the boy had done well as a fast bowler.
   
"The selectors put to trial the other young Test paceman Shahid Nazir,
who was a strong candidate for inclusion into the side, but were not
satisfied with his fitness and form. They have given their verdict in
favour of Muhammad Akram", said the former Test captain and now the PCB
chief executive Majid Khan.

The Toronto-bound Pakistan team captain Ramiz Raja, who returned on
Saturday after holidaying in Britain, told this reporter in a brief chat
on Monday morning that he was scheduled to reach Karachi in the evening.
In all probability, Ramiz Raja will resume training in the camp on
Tuesday.

Spinner Mushtaq Ahmad had played important part in winning the first
Sahara Cup Cricket series against India last year on the turning Toronto
pitches. He would be sorely missed this time like Wasim Akram and Waqar
Younis.
    
Mention of the speed-merchant Waqar Younis reminds one that the lethal
bowler has expressed his inability to play for the Pakistan team because
he was busy in helping his county Glamorgan in gaining top-berth in the
All-England Championship.

The 17-member Pakistan team is:
    
Captain Ramiz Raja, Vice-captain Saeed Anwar, Shahid Afridi, Salim Malik,
Ejaz Ahmad Senior, Inzimam-ul-Haq, Moin Khan, Hasan Raza, Azhar Mahmood,
Muhammad Akram, Aaqib Javed, Kabir Khan, Saqlain Mushtaq, Muhammad
Husain. Manager: Maazullah Khan. Coach: Haroon Rashid.
    
Physiotherapist: Dr Dan Kiesel.

<a name="fina">Finances main problem for Akhtar Rasool: Atif</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Walter Fernandez
   
KARACHI, Sept 4: Brig (retd) Manzoor Hussain Atif, Senior Vice President
of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and Chairman of the World
Hockey Rules Board, has lauded the election of former Olympian Akhtar
Rasool as President of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) in an
exclusive interview to `Dawn' here on Thursday.
   
"I feel extremely happy for Akhtar Rasool, who is the first Olympian or
in other words a `Technocrat' to have been elevated to the position of
the Pakistan hockey supremo from the post of the PHF Senior Vice
President and that too, in the Golden Jubilee year of the country's
creation," added Brig. Atif, a former PHF Secretary, who returned home
today after an almost nine-month stay in Harrare (Zimbabwe) where he was
attending to his personal business.
   
"After a pretty long time Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Managing
Director has not been elected as the PHF President. However, the National
carrier which has been a great benefactor of the country's hockey for
over three decades, should continue their support in the very same
fashion as before," said the FIH Senior Vice President.
   
"The National carrier also arranged to host the Champions Trophy World
Hockey Tournament in the country every two years. PIA also defrays the
entire expenses for the tournament besides providing the visiting teams
and officials with tickets and daily allowance," stated Brig. Manzoor
Hussain Atif.
   
"Akhtar Rasool is the product of the game. So he will understand every
aspect of it and I wish he turns out to be a success," said the Guru of
the World Hockey Rules Board. "But what really is required for Akhtar
Rasool to become a success as the Pakistan hockey boss should be plenty
of finance. But with him being a member of the Pakistan Muslim League and
the Prime Minister also from the same party that should not be found
wanting," explained the FIH Senior Vice President.
   
"Nonetheless, what Akhtar Rasool should initially concentrate on, is
trying to institutionalize the finances of the federation. For even if
the government is changed that then would not financially affect the
PHF," opined Brig. Manzoor Hussain Atif.
   
"The PHF was in the pink of health during the tenure of retired Air
Marshal Nur Khan. Although, Nur Khan was not a hockey technocrat, he was
a brilliant administrator and contributed a hell of a lot in terms of
finances to the PHF. Since I filled the latter role as the PHF Secretary,
I must add Nur Khan had a tremendous mind and had the uncanny knack of
sifting out what was good for the game from my numerous conversations
with him," concluded the Chairman of the World Hockey Rules Board.
   
Brig. Manzoor Hussain Atif, who at present is not in very good health,
has shed aside all his personal business for the time being and is
proceeding to Islamabad on Friday to have a complete medical checkup.

<a name="pcbo">PCB officials accused of demanding 'cut'</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan
   
KARACHI, Sept 5: In one of the biggest financial scandals involving the
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), three of its officials were accused of
demanding kickbacks in a financial deal estimated to be around Rs 10
million.
   
One of the three officials was PCB Secretary, Waqar Ahmad, it was
alleged. However, when the 'commission' was declined by a representative
of a multinational company, Waqar Ahmad and his two companions advised
the PCB chief executive, Majid Khan, to end the 10-year-old working
relationship with Adamjee Insurance Company.
   
EFU, another multinational insurance company, was awarded the contract.
   
S.M Aslam Khan, Deputy Manager (Development), Adamjee Insurance Company,
alleged that Waqar Ahmad and his other two colleagues had demanded a
kickback of 22% from an outstanding premium of Rs 1,167,050 which the PCB
had been delaying since March this year.
   
"On June 25, I was directed by Majid Khan (PCB chief executive), to talk
to a committee which was formed by him. During the course of the meeting
apart from technical points of the insurance policies, they (committee
members) insisted that how much rebate or commission I could offer them,"
Aslam Khan alleged.
   
Aslam states that according to the demand of 22% from the pending claim
of Rs 1,167,050, the committee was to get approximately Rs 215,000. Aslam
continued saying that when he refused to accept their claim, they
(committee members) said they would invite other insurance companies "and
whichever insurance company will offer them the best rate of commission,
they would consider that."
   
"I must tell you here that no insurance company can give you rebate
because it is forbidden legally," Aslam pointed out.
   
Aslam further alleged that the PCB officials wanted him to issue a cover
note for the players, National and Qadhafi Stadia and Cricket House for a
year which he did. Aslam emphasized that once a cover note was issued,
the establishment stood committed with the insurance company. "The
insurance company, on the other hand, stood committed to cover the
risk."
   
"On May 22, I went off the way to get the cover note for the players,
stadia and Cricket House. Normally, we don't issue cover notes without
payment but in their (PCB) case, we did it considering our old
relationship with them besides they (PCB) being a reliable organization,"
Aslam said.
   
"Majid Khan could neither take a stand for a firm decision on his
honorable commitment nor he understood the commercial implications of a
cover note," he added.
   
Aslam said the players and stadia cover was for a year. He added that the
PCB used to issue them a program of the team's nternational commitments
but the players were endorsed accordingly because some were retained and
some dropped.
   
Aslam admitted that a claim was filed by the PCB but it was not honored
because the premium was not paid. "Inzamamul Haq was injured in Sri Lanka
and the PCB filed a claim but was rejected outright because no premium
was paid. Had the premium been submitted, Inzamam would have got the
match fee which he couldn't because he was not insured." Aslam also cited
an example of Tauseef Ahmad whose Rs 50,000 medical expenses were paid by
his insurance company as the player was comprehensively insured.
   
A detailed report with documentary evidence has been dispatched to the
Patron of the PCB, President Farooq Ahmad Khan. "I have nothing to hide
and want to keep the President informed about the corruption which has
started creeping in the PCB," said Aslam Khan.
   
Efforts were made to contact the PCB officials, for their version, but
none was available for comment.
