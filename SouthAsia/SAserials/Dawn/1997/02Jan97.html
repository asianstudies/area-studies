<a name="jide">JI decides to boycott elections</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ashraf Mumtaz

LAHORE, Dec 29: The electoral process in Pakistan received the first 
setback on Sunday when the Jamaat-i-Islami announced its decision to 
boycott the February 3 elections mainly because of the failure of the 
caretaker government to keep the corrupt elements out of the electoral 
process and because the major political parties had fielded such candidates 
as did not meet the requirements mentioned in Article 62 of the 
Constitution.
    
The decision was announced by Jamaat Amir Qazi Husain Ahmed at a news 
conference here on Sunday on the second day of the three-day central Shoora 
meeting at Mansoora.
    
He said the Jamaat candidates would withdraw their nomination papers.
    
The Jamaat chief said in the present situation accountability and not 
elections was the major public demand and the Jamaat would start a series 
of sits-in all provincial capitals to mobilise the public opinion about it 
and to persuade the voters and other political parties away from elections. 
However, he made it clear that the Jamaat would not force the people not to 
exercise their franchise.
    
The Jamaat had contested the 1993 elections from the platform of the 
Pakistan Islamic Front (PIF) and had bagged three NA and about half a dozen 
PA seats. It had polled 645,278 votes in these elections.
    
The Pakistan Muslim League has described the Jamaats decision as 
unfortunate and made it clear that it would have no impact or effect on the 
PML plan to fully participate in the electoral process.

The interim prime minister and the chief election commissioner have already 
announced that boycott by any party would have no effect on elections and 
the government would stick to poll schedule of February 3.

<a name="jirg">Jirga not to allow women to vote</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, Dec 31: The controversy over women's voting in the ensuing 
general elections was settled on Tuesday when all the eight Afridi sub-
clans decided that women would not be allowed to cast their votes.

A grand jirga of Afridi sub-clans held at Bara took the decision to debar 
women from voting. It was also attended by 43 candidates for National 
Assembly seats.

The jirga observed that women would neither be registered as voters nor 
allowed to cast vote. It also decided that any male member of a family who 
would bring or allow any woman to cast her vote would be fined up to 
Rs500,000 and his house would be torched.

<a name="isla">Islamabad stops all funds to provinces</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Jan 1: Islamabad did not release any fund to the provinces, 
including their shares from the federal divisible pool, during the last two 
months causing acute financial crunch.
    
Sindh has not received its share of funds, about Rs2 billion a month, for 
November and December, causing acute financial problems well placed 
sources disclosed saying that resource crunch in the province had led to 
heavy dependence on overdraft from the State Bank of Pakistan.
    
Enquiries made with the relevant sources revealed that Sindhs overdraft 
with the State Bank was somewhere near Rs9 billion as against the 
prescribed limit of Rs667 million.
    
Confirming the resource crunch in the province, caretaker Finance Minister 
Kunwar Idress was confident of getting the overdue amounting to over Rs4 
billion in the next few days which he hoped would ease the financial 
situation in the province.

However, no plausible explanation is available as to why the federal 
government stopped the flow of funds to the provinces that include even the 
share from the federal divisible pool which is a constitutional obligation.
    
In accordance with the 1996-97 budget, he said, Islamabad would provide a 
total of Rs34.51 billion to Sindh in fiscal 1996-97 as its share from the 
federal divisible pool. It comes to roughly Rs2.9 billion a month he said 
and explained that Rs500 million are deducted at source on account of debt 
servicing and Rs400 million are deducted against arrears of WAPDA and other 
utilities. It leaves a net inflow of Rs2 billion every month, he said.
    
He disclosed that Sindh had cleared all the arrears of WAPDA and other 
utilities. The province has asked the federal government to stop 
deductions at source and let the provincial government adjust bills 
directly with WAPDA and other utilities.

<a name="imra">Imran blames Nawaz for Rs5bn plot scandal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Jan 1: Imran Khan, chief of the Pakistan Tehrik-i-Insaf, said 
here on Wednesday that his party would not boycott the forthcoming general 
election.
    
Addressing a press conference at the outset of his election campaign in the 
federal capital from where he is contesting election, the PTI chief said 
his party would not boycott the poll under any circumstances, and added: 
Our party is against the postponement of elections.
    
He, however, added that the Jamaat-i-Islami, which had boycotted the 
elections, had a valid point. Four governments in the past had been 
dismissed on the charge of corruption and it was wrong to go for fresh 
elections under the same system in which the same people again managed to 
come into the assemblies, PTI chief pointed out.
    
Mr Khan also released a document called Mian Nawaz Sharifs plot 
plundering record. He claimed that, as chief minister, Punjab, Mr Sharif 
had caused a loss of Rs 5 billion to the Punjab treasury. He alleged that 
Mr Sharif had allotted plots worth Rs 5 billion as a political patronage, 
in violation of the law.
    
According to Imran Khans findings, Mr Sharif, as chief minister, Punjab, 
had allotted: 1,111 plots in various development schemes of LDA; 2,027 
plots of Housing and Physical Planning Department of Punjab; about 147 
plots, worth 150 million, to MNAs/MPAs, political leaders and other 
influential people; eight tracts of valuable land with costly timber trees 
in Murree; 27 mostly commercial and some community plots for residential 
purpose; 66 one-kanal plots against only 20 that were available for 
allotment in M.A. Jauhar Town scheme; and 45 one-kanal plots against 27 
available in the Sabzazar Housing Scheme.

<a name="trib">Tribunals get powers to debar candidates</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Dec 30: The caretaker government on Monday approved another 
amendment in the Representation of Peoples Act 1976 giving suo moto powers 
to the eight election tribunals to debar the defaulters of loans, taxes and 
utility charges from contesting the general election.
    
The decision was followed by a an official list containing the names of 
1538 candidates or their relatives who are defaulters of utility services.
    
A handout issued after the Federal cabinet meeting said the amendment, to 
be made law through a presidential ordinance, was made in view of the 
possibility that a candidate may suppress the required information 
regarding the default in payment of loans, taxes, or utility bills and thus 
succeed in getting his nomination papers accepted.
    
The new amendment said: If a tribunal constituted under sub- section (5) 
is, on the basis of information or material coming to its knowledge from 
any source, satisfied that a candidate whose nomination paper has been 
accepted is a defaulter of loan, taxes, government dues or utility charges 
or has had any loan written off or suffers from any other disqualification 
from being elected as a member of an assembly, it may suo moto call upon 
such candidate to show cause why his nomination paper should not be 
rejected, and if it is satisfied that the candidate is a defaulter as 
aforesaid or has had a loan written off or suffers from any other 
disqualification, may reject his nomination paper.

<a name="more">More corruption cases against past rulers soon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Dec 27: Caretaker Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid on Friday 
announced that more corruption cases will be instituted against past rulers 
within the next few days on the basis of evidence already collected.
    
The caretaker prime minister said these would expose to the nation the 
misdeeds of those holding positions from top to bottom in the past. We 
have to take the unpleasant step for the survival of the nation, he said.
    
Meraj said under the Constitution the caretaker government had the mandate 
of holding free, fair and impartial elections within the stipulated time 
and to initiate accountability process. When it was necessary to dismiss 
the government on the charge of corruption it was also essential to hold 
accountable all the corrupt rulers for their misdeeds, he said.
    
Malik Meraj Khalid said the Ehtesab Ordinance was accepted by all because 
it was a complete law but people have started our accountability because 
they want us to do much more than giving an ordinance.

<a name="paki">Pakistan warns India on Prithvi deployment</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Dec 26: Pakistan has once again drawn world attention to a 
likely threat of ballistic missile race in South Asia because of admitted 
deployment of Prithvi missile by India, and warned that Pakistan reserves 
its right to take necessary measures to counter the Indian threat to its 
security.
    
A Foreign Office spokesman was asked for Pakistans reaction to a recent 
statement of the Indian external affairs minister on a foreign TV , in 
which he had confirmed deployment of Prithvi missile. Over the years, 
Pakistan had repeatedly warned that India would deploy the Pakistan-
specific missile, capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction, he said.

Reaffirming Pakistans plea for a zero missile zone regime in South Asia, 
he observed that Pakistan reserved the right to take necessary measures to 
safeguard its security.

<a name="twot">Two TJP leaders, four others shot dead</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Report

LAHORE, Dec 31: Two TJP leaders and four others were shot dead and one was 
injured on Tuesday by unidentified assailants in two different incidents 
that took place in Lahore and Multan.

The first incident occurred at village Lakh Chandra in the Lahore's Kot 
Lakhpat area.

Zulfiqar Naqvi, 50, an advocate by profession, was a central executive 
committee member of the TJP and in charge of its political wing in the 
Punjab. He had filed nomination papers for the Punjab Assembly from two 
Lahore seats, PP-126 and PP-133, as independent candidate. Mr Naqvi's 
murder comes within a few days of the killing of Punjab Ombudsman, Justice 
(retd) Muhammad Munir Khan.

He was on his way to his office in the city with his son, a friend, his 
private driver and a police guard in a car when they were killed on the 
Ferozepur-Kahna link road. The motive behind the multiple murder was not 
immediately clear. Some police officers were of the view that this was an 
attempt on the part of a terrorist group to re-start sectarian killings.

Senior police and district officials visited the spot, and were treating 
the slaying as sectarian. Other suspected the involvement of TJP's rival 
group. However, police said they had no concrete evidence to declare it a 
sectarian incident.

Police have yet to register a case.

In Multan, TJP district president Ayub Siddique was gunned down and his 
companion injured when two motorcyclists fired at them here on Tuesday 
night.

Ayub Siddique and his companion, unidentified so far, were on their to 
Suraj Miani from Harram Gate in a rickshaw at around 9:15pm, when unknown 
people intercepted them near the Bohar Gate. They fired at them with a 
Klashanikov. They received injuries and were taken to the Nishtar Hospital. 
Siddique died in the hospital.  The condition of his companion is serious.

<a name="usbi">US biggest importer of Pakistani products</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Dec 31: United States emerged as the top buyer of Pakistani 
products during 1995-96, accounting for 15.5% of total exports which stood 
at $8.7 billion, 7% more than during the previous year, according to Export 
Promotion Bureau's statistics.

The second highest importer of Pakistani goods was Hong Kong, worth $792 
million, up 47.5% over 1994-95.

In contrast to United States, whose imports from Pakistan mainly account

1994-95.

Germany emerged as the third biggest buyer of Pakistani products. Exports 
to that country during 1995-96 amounted to $593 million against $571 
million in 1994-95. Its share in total exports from Pakistan declined from 
7% to 6.8%.

<a name="grea">Greater powers to SBP, Banking Council abolished</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 1: The caretaker federal cabinet on Wednesday decided to 
abolish the Pakistan Banking Council and approved an amendment in the State 
Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 to strengthen the regulatory role of the central 
bank over commercial banks and financial institutions.
    
The cabinet also decided to revise its earlier decision of cancelling the 
contract awarded to IBM for preparing computerised identity cards.
    
By amending the Banks (Nationalisation) Act 1974, the cabinet abolished the 
Pakistan Banking Council, a regulatory body over the commercialised banks 
and instead gave these powers to the State Bank.
    
Now the central bank will be empowered to appoint chairmen and presidents 
of nationalised commercial banks and development financial institutions.
    
The amendments in the Banks Act has also created a new post of chairman of 
the boards of all nationalised commercial banks and financial institutions.
    
By approving an amendment in the State Bank Act, the cabinet empowered the 
central bank to regulate and monitor the performance of the nationalised 
commercial banks and development financial institutions, a job previously 
done by the Banking Council which is being abolished.
    
However, the power of licensing and regulation of non-banking financial 
institutions would be vested in the Corporate Law Authority.

The cabinet, an official handout said, also decided to review its earlier 
decision of cancelling the IBM contract for preparing the national identity 
cards.
    
It formed a four-member committee to re-evaluate the agreement and present 
its recommendations for consideration.
    
The IBM was preparing a citizens database and computerised national 
identity card on built, operate and transfer basis but the caretaker 
cabinet cancelled its contract accusing the previous government of awarding 
the contract without inviting bids.
    
The cabinet decision had not been taken well by the multinational companies 
and many of them had refused to bring in new investments. This perhaps 
forced the government to revise its decision.

<a name="dosa">Dos and donts of trade with India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Zakir H. Rizvi

IN THE ERA of globalisation when the world is inching towards free trade, 
the issue of trade with India and vehement opposition to it betrays 
emotional immaturity and technological backwardness on our part. Trade with 
India has been branded as a security risk, compromise on Kashmir, 
strangulation of our industry, disloyalty to the nation and a means of 
cultural invasion, by some quarters.
    
The issue has bitterly divided thinkers, opinion makers and entrepreneurs. 
On one side are those who favour free trade with India. They are staunchly 
opposed by those who want no trade. A few rare souls, however, have the 
moderate approach of controlled trade. Its time to take stock what is 
behind the cacophony of rhetoric and slogan mongering: lucid arguments or 
blinkered righteousness.
    
Those who oppose the idea of trade with India say that it will be 
instrumental in driving our entrepreneurs out of business. A massive flow 
of better and cheaper Indian goods into our markets will hit the indigenous 
industry which cant stomach foreign competition. Indian goods are cheaper 
than ours due to availability of cheaper raw material, electricity, 
subsidies and other tax exemptions.
    
They further argue that motivated by malice, Indian entrepreneurs under 
official patronage will dump their products in our markets and begin 
exploitation after putting down roots here.
    
The proposition of no trade is supported by highlighting Indian 
atrocities in held Kashmir. Some politicians and religious leaders have 
said declaration of MFN to India will make Kashmiris feel that they are 
being abandoned. 
   
Trade shouldnt be at the cost of Kashmir.
    
Then there are many who have declaring it a security risk. They anticipate 
that opening of borders will trigger anti-Pakistan activities by Indian 
agents. Some leaders hold the opinion that it will lead to a cultural 
invasion from India.
    
Those who favour trade with India consider it a panacea for our economic 
ills. It will, they argue, ensure maximum allocation of resources, as 
variety of goods, spurs competition and increases employment in the long 
run. People will be saved from exploitation by local hoarders.
    
Pragmatism, they claim, demands that we legalise trade with India, which is 
already taking place in the form of smuggling. The time has come that we 
enter into free trade either by forming customs union or common market like 
the European Community and European Free Trade Association. This, they 
believe is what we are supposed to do, being a signatory of GATT and WTO 
regime.
    
The fact of the matter is that the two groups have gone too far in opposing 
each other. Our incompetent entrepreneurs, addicted to protectionism and 
backed by narrow-minded politicians, have always benefited from Indo-Pak 
rivalry and the Kashmir issue and suggest no trade. At variance with them, 
are those who either dont comprehend free trade, GATT and WTO or are 
enjoying economies of large scale production.
    
Neither argument seems plausible. The opponents of trade should take into 
account that trade includes imports as well as exports. It incorporates 
goods as well as services. We dont want to trade, means we dont want to 
have their services too. But what about our students who are availing and 
want to avail the services of Indian authors.
    
If raw material is cheap in India, we can have it from them. By importing 
raw material at a low tariff rate and letting finished goods manufactured 
by the same material enter at a high tariff rate, we can protect our 
domestic industry far more than the nominal tariff rate. Availability of 
cheap electricity in India doesnt imply the policy of no trade. Our 
government, instead of increasing utility bills should prevent electricity 
theft to reduce the cost of power production.
    
If India is giving any subsidy or rebate to her exports, the GATT makes it 
binding on her to give details. If the consequence is dumping, then we have 
every right to impose countervailing duty on subsidised imports from India.
    
The fear of exploitation by Indian entrepreneurs is out of the question in 
the wake of bilateral trade. Some political pundits treat trade as a 
compromise on Kashmir. Well it is not, it will augur well for Pakistan, and 
will not dampen the spirits of the Kashmiris. 
    
Entry of Indian agents in the name of trade is another argument, but when 
we have access to their country via trade, they wont choose trade for 
subversive activities. Closing trade due to this purpose will be tantamount 
to poisoning an entire garden to kill a few bugs.
    
Lastly, the fear of cultural invasion is next to impossible, as we are in 
the age of the dish and satellite, and cannot prevent interaction among the 
two cultures. Youll hardly find a house in Pakistan without Indian video 
and audio cassettes. We can maintain our identity and defend our values 
like our territory.
    
Formal opening of trade between two countries will manifest in both their 
favour, as at present a lot of clandestine trade worth millions of rupees 
(according to a private estimate) already takes place lifting trade 
barriers will only affect smugglers and corrupt officials.
    
There is a lot of misconception about GATT and WTO. General Agreement on 
Trade and Tariff is all about persuasion and negotiations. It doesnt 
besiege any signatory to engage in free trade, but invokes to reduce tariff 
and non-tariff barriers to mutually agreed level.
    
According to the Director General of WTO: WTOs objective is not just to 
create further liberalisation, but to do so inside rules and disciplines 
agreed to by all member states and ratified by all their parliaments.
    
In the absence of trade barriers Pakistan will be flooded by Indian goods. 
Indian light and heavy machinery, chemicals, fertilisers, transport goods, 
electrical appliances and food products will dominate our industry, which 
is in its nascent stage, we should interlocute with New Delhi, the 
exclusion of such items which we want to protect.
    
Both can impose Voluntary Export Restriction on some commodities for a 
specific time period. They can identify industries on which a specified 
level of reduction in tariff, say by 30 per cent, may be imposed. We should 
focus on acquisition of technology and assistance in R&D. If we can have 
procure it from America, there is no wrong in procuring it from India.
    
The needs of our present and future demands from us to put at rest the 
heritage of misperceptions and promote economic co-operation in the region 
to ensure economic prosperity for South Asia.

<a name="bour">Pakistani bourses to assist TSE</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dilawar Hussain

The previous week, Tashkent Stock Exchange (TSE) finally issued a Letter of 
Intent (LoI), inviting the Karachi and Lahore Stock Exchanges to assist and 
support Uzbekistans fledgling stock exchange in nearly all aspects of its 
formation and operation.
    
The Pakistani bourses are jubilant; in a statement last Thursday, the 
Karachi Stock Exchange explained why: This is a significant development, 
in that the project established the credibility of the Pakistan capital 
market, especially the fact that IFC chose the KSE and LSE for 
collaboration with the TSE.
    
The countrys capital markets are sure that the development heralds the 
beginning of an era of economic co-operation between Pakistan and 
Uzbekistan, and would lead to greater economic relations between the two 
countries and the rapid development of their capital markets.
    
The TSE move came following the visit of a two-member delegation to 
Tashkent escorted by the officials of the International Finance Corporation 
(IFC) between November 27 and December 7. Possibilities of collaboration 
and exchange of information and technologies between the capital markets of 
the two countries were explored. The LoI has identified areas in which the 
Pakistani stock markets can render assistance.
    
These include activation of the secondary market; improving the quality of 
listing procedure and devising listing procedures and rules and 
regulations; making quality presentations to foreign investors and 
disseminating knowledge about the investment opportunities available to 
participate profitably in the privatisation process and to make sound 
investment in the secondary market; to improve the payments, clearing and 
settlement systems and information dissemination; to build the 
institutional framework of the capital market benefiting from the 
experience in Pakistan and creating these institutions with collaboration 
and equity participation of Tashkent, Karachi and Lahore Stock Exchanges 
and others as may be necessary; training of personnel of exchange and 
market participants and holding of seminars and discussions for the various 
levels.

International exposure
    
In the first instance, the project is to be of medium term, which would 
last for a minimum period of one year. The Pakistan markets will get 
international exposure and this signals the beginning of new 
opportunities, says Mr Iqbal Ismail, adviser to the President of the 
Karachi Stock Exchange, who was one of the two delegates to Tashkent.  Mr 
Iqbal mentions the possibilities of export of technologies, creation of new 
jobs for Pakistanis in the Central Asian States and best of all the foreign 
exchange and goodwill that the country would earn, as several other 
positive points of the new contract.
    
For all this, both Mr Ismail and the other delegate, Dr. Yasir Mahmood of 
the LSE, credit the Chairman CLA, Khalil Masood, without whose active 
encouragement, they insist, the mission may not have been accomplished.
    
The historic city of Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan, a country 
inhibited by 22.2 million people. The country boasts a literacy rate of 97 
per cent, with more than 25 per cent of the people being science graduates.
    
The country has a surplus in electricity and the underground railway 
network in Tashkent is good as anywhere in the world. Uzbekistan has 
abundant resources of uranium, gold, copper, iron, limestone, gypsum and 
oil and gas. Cotton, silk, wheat and fruits are the main agricultural 
products.
    
The officials of the CLA and the KSE, having been able to make the first 
foray into the vast and emerging capital markets of the Central Asian 
States, are understandably brimming with optimism about the endless 
possibilities. But when the celebrations are over, they would have to get 
down to some serious business. Heart-breaking problems can not but be 
foreseen.

Grey areas
    
The Tashkent Stock Exchange (TSE) established in 1994, is fully 
computerised. There are a dozen regional exchanges, called the branches of 
the Tashkent Stock Exchange.
    
Around 4,000 companies, currently under various stages of privatisation, 
are quoted on the TSE. There is no secondary market and the trading is over 
the counter. The companies have been allowed to be quoted to facilitate the 
privatisation programme.
    
As privatisation gathers pace, hundreds of companies are expected to seek 
listing. The State Property Board called (GKI) is the privatising agency 
and the main buyers are the employees of collectives anxious to secure the 
controlling shares.
    
The listing procedure and rules and regulations are being formulated. 
Because of inherent weakness, not all the 4,000 currently quoted companies 
may qualify for listing.
    
Under the generally accepted listing conditions, only 8 of the total would 
have qualified for listing. In respect of trading of equities, it is good 
to observe that payments are prompt and at least for the moment, risk of 
defaults does not exist, since all commitments to buy have to be backed up 
by a bank guarantee.
    
But the problems remain in the procedures of payments and settlements which 
do not interface. Additionally, when the secondary market has been created, 
defaults risk would emerge as bank guarantees for market transactions may 
not be possible all the time.
    
The long era of socialism and closed economy has inculcated the habit of 
secrecy within the companies, which is evidenced in the accounting 
standards adopted.
    
It is difficult to obtain material information about companies due to 
underdeveloped accounting standards and lack of disclosure of information. 
All of which would make presentations to foreign investors difficult on 
international standards.
    
The TSE has in place a certification programme which applies to both 
members and agents. Besides universities which offer specialised courses, a 
functioning institute imparts courses on capital markets. 
    
The Pakistani bourses would be required to acquaint the personnel of the 
exchange and the market participants with our practices and to explain 
recommendations.

<a name="imfc">IMF conditions:  Rs 50bn in new taxes?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem

THE GOOD NEWS is that the IMF has released $76 million out of the $579 
million stand-by credit that was agreed upon between the Government of 
Pakistan (GOP) and the Funds Executive Board on December 13, 1995.
    
According to another IMF press release of December 17, 1996, the Executive 
Board approved a request by the Government of Pakistan to extend the 
current stand-by credit through end-September 1997 and to augment the 
amount available under it by SDR 160.74 million (about US$231 million) 
.......
    
In return for the disbursement of this interest-bearing loan  that has a 
deadline of September 79, by which time it is to be paid back  the GOP is 
expected to impose massive new taxes, build up foreign exchange reserves of 
$1.6 billion, collect surcharges of Rs 26 billion by June 97, reduce bank 
borrowing to a maximum of Rs 42 billion, increase utility rates and curtail 
the budget deficit to a maximum of Rs 101 billion or equal to 4 per cent of 
GDP.

IMFs interest

To be certain, the IMFs primary interest is to guarantee circumstances 
under which our economy remains capable of servicing the billions that we 
have borrowed from the Fund ever since we became its member on July 11, 
1950. Absolutely nothing wrong with that.
    
The Fund has lent us money and they have a right to safeguard repayment. 
While we try and maintain just such a debt-servicing capability, our 
government would, perhaps, be forced to undertake structural reforms that 
it might not have undertaken otherwise.
    
Surely, nothing wrong with curtailing the bloated deficit or, for that 
matter, reducing the governments bank borrowing and also accumulating hard 
currency reserves that are at least sufficient to finance 8 to 10 weeks of 
imports.
    
The original stand-by credit has been enhanced but the release of the next 
tranche shall really depend on how well the interim government is able to 
implement the conditionalities. The odds, however, are that it will not be 
able to meet them.
    
There is, to be sure, nothing new about the IMFs prime conditionality of 
drastically reducing budgetary deficit as the principal prerequisite to 
additional loans.
    
The other important conditionality has frequently been successive 
devaluations to cure trade deficits. Currently, 61 of the 179 member-
countries are at various stages of implementing tax increases and 
devaluation schedules supported by the IMFs regular and concessional 
lending programmes (EFF, CCFF, STF, SAF or ESAF). Tax increases and 
devaluations, unfortunate as these are both have a history of being 
largely unsuccessful.
    
In almost all of the 61 recipient-countries, the IMFs primary emphasis 
over the years, has remained on the escalation of taxes as a route to close 
the gap between government expenditure and revenue (budget deficit).
    
In almost all cases where tax increases was used as the sole toll to cut 
budget deficit the results have not been encouraging. An increase in taxes, 
more often than not, decreases economic initiative to produce and either 
retards production or, as is the case in most developing countries, causes 
a migration of productive sub-sectors over to the informal economy (which 
by definition is outside the tax net).
    
The present tax/GDP ratio in Pakistan, for instance, is satisfactory by 
most standards (meaning that enough taxes are being collected given the 
current parameters).
    
The solution really lies in expanding the tax net itself and in the 
rationalising of the existing revenue collection mechanism. The problem, at 
the same time, clearly lies in the notion that tax increases, in the 
Pakistani context, shall end up in increased government revenue.

Additional taxes

The budget 1995-96 had imposed an additional Rs 11 billion in direct taxes 
and a colossal Rs 23 billion in the form of new indirect taxes. The Budget 
1996-97 also had Rs 41 billion in new tax measures. If that wasnt enough, 
the recently announced mini-budget had another Rs 13 billion of extra 
taxes.
    
The IMF now insists that the budgetary deficit should be reduced by close 
to 2 percentage points. Considering that, in the IMFs terminology, a drop 
of each percentage point means Rs 25 billion of new taxes, are our economic 
decision makers now preparing to burden the economy with an additional Rs 
50 billion load?
    
If additional taxation was to lead us into higher government collection, we 
would have reached that goal long time ago. Instead, we have a stagnating 
economy where budgetary estimates of revenue are always brought down and 
the actual collection at the end of every fiscal period is much lower than 
both the budgetary, as well as the revised, estimates.
    
Another tax increase is not the answer. New taxes will not result in 
additional revenue and the government will not be able to narrow the 
budgetary gap. What we really need to do is to stimulate the economy. 
Expand the productive capacity. Increase the overall size of the economic 
base. Enlarge the tax net. Add incentives to work and to produce more and 
create a business environment in which individuals can work towards 
increasing their income.
    
An argument is frequently made that out of 130 million people, less than 
one million are direct tax payers, rightly so. The average income is just 
so low that one cant really expect an average Pakistani to become a tax 
payer. There is simply nothing left after roti, kapra and the hugely 
discriminatory regime of indirect taxation on each and everything that a 
common man must consume.
    
Successive governments have failed to provide conditions for the private 
sector to grow and allow individuals to engage in rewarding employment. One 
hundred and thirty million Pakistanis collectively produce what a mere 5 
million Taiwanese or 3 million Singaporeans would do. How can a rational 
IMF expect an average Pakistani to pay direct taxes also when it is next to 
nothing that he takes home as wages?
    
It is important that the IMF stays assured of its repayment, principal as 
well as interest. it is also important that the budgetary deficit is 
brought down. The historical evidence, however, suggests that none of these 
goals can be reached by increasing taxes.
    
The budget deficit, for one, cannot be narrowed by merely enhancing taxes 
on everything in sight. Expenditures would have to be cut, and drastically 
so, along with the introduction of definite measures to enlarge the overall 
productive capacity of the economy, which shall in return, expand the tax 
potential.

<a name="mism">Mismanagement costs nation $2 billion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Dec 28: The environmental mismanagement takes its toll on Pakistan 
economy to the tune at least of $2.180 billion every year-roughly 4 per 
cent of its GNP.
    
Quoting a World Bank study, a World Bank official Mr. Tariq Husain said 
here on Saturday the mismanagement made tens of millions of Pakistanis to 
suffer.
    
The crisis in science is deeper than our economic crisis..., he said 
while delivering 12th Zahid Hussain Memorial Lecture organised by the State 
Bank of Pakistan. He urged the government to appoint a commission of 
eminent scientists that could help it frame sustainable economic policies 
with least adverse impact on the environment.
    
Mr. Tariq Hussain, Director, Learning & Leadership Centre of the World Bank 
dwelt exhaustively on the factors impeding economic growth in Pakistan in 
his 45-minutes lecture titled PakistanRole of Education for a Sustainable 
Future.

Speaking about the gap between the income of the rich and the poor he said: 
In comparison with India, Indonesia and BangladeshPakistan has the 
highest level of inequality. He said some 40 million people or one third 
of Pakistans total population live in absolute poverty.

<a name="stoc">Stocks contradict predictions, open on promising note</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 1: Contrary to overnight predictions, stocks on Wednesday 
opened the new account on a promising note as the strength of the base 
shares spillover to other counters.
    
Analysts, however, ruled out the possibility of any tangible new year gain 
in the subsequent sessions as the developing political scenario could 
hardly be ideal for the share business until the current uncertainty, both 
on the financial and the economic front, is over.
    
Both PTC vouchers and Hub-Power are capable of putting the index on the 
right track owing to their massive saying in it, but it is pretty difficult 
to build any strong base on it for a longer period, they added.
    
It was well reflected in the performance of the broader market and its 
inability to reinforce the initial gains as the genuine buying support is 
still shy.

Many analysts said revival of strong demand, which pushed the index higher 
to 1,354.64 from the last years bottom level of 1,339.93, was not 
technically inspired but appeared to be inspired for obvious reasons.
    
Some others said together with the incentive package announced at the fag-
end of last year to boost the capital markets, the comfortable supply of 
money in the sessions to come could push the market at least to a more 
viable level.
    
This perception was, however, not shared by others who think it is too 
early to say something about the direction of the market in the new trading 
year.

However, the market reaction to the current political uncertainty and news 
of sectarian killing will be known during the next week as both could well 
prove major inhibiting factors.
    
The Wednesdays snap new year rally could hardly prove a befitting 
greeting, as sustaining factors around are not many.

The minus signs again dominated the scene under the lead of leading 
multinational shares, notably Shell Pakistan, Philips, Siemens Pakistan, 
Knoll Pharma, Brooke Bond and Parke-Davis, falling by one rupee to Rs 5.
    
Commercial Union Insurance followed them, falling by Rs 3 on active selling 
coming from locals. EFU Life Insurance also fell by Rs 1.50 on renewed 
selling.
    
Other local blue chips shares, which finished lower, were led by National 
Fibre, Balochistan Wheels, Zeal-Pak Cement, Pakistan Refinery, Dewan 
Textiles, KSB Pumps and Elite Publishers, which suffered decline ranging 
from one rupee to 1.75.
    
MCB, which has been under pressure for the last two sessions and has fallen 
substantially on news of disinvestment of remaining shares in government 
control, was boosted by news of visit of its new president to the Karachi 
Stock Exchange and a possible announcement of enhancement of credit 
facilities for the new year, rose modestly on active short-covering at the 
lower level.
    
Dewan Salman followed it, which was actively traded on heavy short-covering 
at the lower level, rising by Rs 1.80.
    
PSO, which has also suffered persistent pruning, recovered by Rs 2 thanks 
to active short-covering at the lower levels.
    
Other good gainers were led by First ICP Mutual fund, Imrooz Modaraba, 
Askari Leasing, Sui Northern and Sui Southern and Quality Steel.
    
Trading volume was maintained at the overnight level of 21 million shares. 
Losers maintained a fair lead over the gainers at 121 to 81 with 59 holding 
on to the last levels.
    
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, up 40 paisa on 4.575 
million shares, followed by Hub-Power, higher 60 paisa on 4.505m, ICI 
Pakistan, firm 60 paisa on 3.830m, Dewan Salman, up Rs 1.80 on 3.635m, and 
Dhan Fibre, steady 15 paisa on 1.190m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by ICI Pakistan (r), up 30 paisa on 
0.204 million shares, FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, steady five paisa on 0.200m, 
MCB, higher 90 paisa on 0.166m, and D. G. Khan Cement, up 25 paisa on 0.145 
million shares.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

SARDAR Farooq Ahmed Khan, President of Pakistan and Tumandar of the 
Legharis, has turned the presidential table around from where it was in GIK 
days to face the Margalla Hills. He sits, Bismarck-like, surveying the 
scene, gazing over the hills into the far distance, rarely moving his eyes 
towards his visitors.
    
But so far, unlike the Iron Chancellor, he does respond to questions. A 
story is told of Bismarck, who at the age of 68 (Leghari is a mere 56) 
suffered from neuralgia, gout, migraine, rheumatism, gallstones, varicose 
veins, influenza, jaundice, shingles, piles, gastric upsets, constipation, 
stomach aches and cramps. Exasperated, he complained, I am not able to 
hold my thoughts continuously. In addition, there is this unbearable 
pressure on my stomach, unspeakable pains. Doctors came and went. Bismark 
was intolerant, received no satisfaction, and chose to unsuccessfully treat 
himself. Ultimately, he sent for the able but highly eccentric Doctor 
Schweninger. At the outset of their first consultation, Bismarck said, I 
dont like being asked questions. Schweningers reply was, Then get a 
vet. He doesnt question his patients. The Chancellor gave in, did what he 
was told, went on a herring diet, took to riding again, exercised his iron 
will, lost 20 kilos, and recovered.
    
The President has gathered together a team of batchmates and friends, many 
of whom are more loyal to him and to themselves than to the country. It is 
said that Legharis first priority is to secure another term in office, and 
that he is working towards this. Nothing extraordinary in that. GIK too 
suffered from the same malaise. Men like General Cincinnatus and General de 
Gaulle do not come by the dozen.
    
Our de jure prime minister, Meraj Khalid, is a well-meaning man. He grew up 
in the Kasur district, near the Indian border, where, of economic 
necessity, ever second man is a smuggler. In the past he has helped friends 
in need, an admirable quality. If some he defended were smugglers, so be 
it. He wants complete accountability before elections. He fears the old 
faces will be back with the scheduled elections and they will do us even 
more harm. He has underscored the need for a revolutionary change to solve 
the socio-economic problems and the removal of moral and other social evils 
from society. (The News, Dec 22). He wants the peoples will to prevail. 
This can be done without a revolution, by the holding of a referendum as is 
provided for in Article 48(6) of the Constitution.
    
The first caretaker Law Minister Fakhruddin Ebrahim made a mess of the 
accountability and other ordinances, then martyred himself yet another 
time. No great loss. The accountability process has just not taken off, as 
it was sincerely hoped it would, though not for want of trying. The team is 
efficient, but is blocked by all the non-co-operators. The new Law 
minister, Shahid Hamid, may perhaps do better. Interior Minister Umer 
Afridi is doing his best as is FIA chief Khawar Zaman, whose organisation 
is overflowing with corrupt and inefficient and dishonest men recruited by 
the previous government. Khawar is weeding madly, but there is no way he 
can get rid of all of the rot overnight.
    
Not one tainted politician, not one supportive acquiescent bureaucrat, 
admits he is corrupt, not one shows any remorse. There are, of course, 
those that are kicking themselves for not having made hay to the extent of 
many of their mates. Bureaucrats protect bureaucrats, servicemen protect 
servicemen. All are stalling in the hope that time will pass, elections 
will be held, they will be rewarded for their pretended ignorance and 
allowed to remain in place.
    
Those that were jailed, and have not yet been released on bail, have 
developed ailments they never had before, have bought their way into 
various hospitals where they hope to stay until the hopefully re-emerging 
freely and fairly elected corrupt government bails them out, recognises 
their past performance and prowess, and rehabilitates them.
    
Precedents abound, the most glaring being Safdar Zaidi. During BBs first 
tenure he did much wrong, was later arrested and then lived in hospital 
until BB was brought back to power. He was re-employed, made chairman of 
the Board of Investment with a federal ministers rank and status, and 
remained glued to his seat until BB was again shot out.
    
Each time ousted Benazir opens her mouth, she does everything possible to 
make matters worse for not only herself but for her country. This week she 
loudly and firmly proclaimed on BBC television that she has never touched, 
let alone taken, one penny of the national exchequer, and that having lost 
her father and her brothers, every human life is sacred to her.
    
In Islamabad it is felt that Benazir, now on a losing wicket, if it should 
suit her will find some excuse to boycott the elections. It is also widely 
surmised that no caretaker wishes to disqualify either Benazir or Nawaz or 
their corrupt cronies. Benazir is to be soundly trounced in the elections 
and the stage set for a Nawaz comeback. Administrators and police are being 
moved around the country to suit the circumstance and the purpose. A bad 
scene.
    
Has everyone conveniently forgotten that Nawaz was a disaster, that 
robbery-wise he outdid Benazir in her first term? But now, in comparison 
with Benazirs second term, he was a bumbler and a bungler, nowhere 
matching her quality. In his second term he may again overtake her.
    
Is this what dissolutions are all about? In 1988, Benazir was brought in 
on a wave of sympathy. She and her government were found to be inept and 
corrupt, and in 1990 the assemblies were dissolved. At that time she was 
considered to be the innocent one, not knowing what Asif and his cronies 
had done. The caretakers came, held elections, and Nawaz and his men were 
brought in. They robbed as much as they could. Again it was said that it 
was not Nawaz, but his father and brother who were largely at fault. His 
father is not a politician, but a businessman, a karobari. Brother Shahbaz 
helped enlarge the industrial empire in the Pakistani manner, by using his 
brothers clout, extracting bank loans, by changing and tailoring SROs to 
suit their needs. They had to go and a seemingly wronged Benazir was 
brought back.
    
Together with her husband and their various cronies, they then proceeded, 
with a vengeance, to rob the country and to destroy its institutions. When 
there was nothing left to be robbed, the family silver and the countrys 
land was sold. Again came the much maligned Article 58(2)(b) and Benazirs 
second government was removed.
    
Must we now have Nawaz again? Has he shown any remorse for his past sins? 
Is he a changed man? Has he sent us any signals to prove that his 
priorities have changed?
    
The constitutionalists who support Nawaz maintain that elections must be 
held within 90 days. They ignore Article 254: When any act or thing is 
required by the Constitution to be done within a particular period and it 
is not done within that period, the doing of the act or thing shall not be 
invalid or otherwise ineffective by reason only that it was not done within 
that period. They overlook Article 48(6): If at any time, the President, 
in his discretion, or on the advice of the Prime Minister, considers that 
it is desirable that any matter of national importance should be referred 
to a referendum, the President may cause the matter to be referred to a 
referendum in the form of a question that is capable of being answered 
either by Yes or No.
    
Why is the President afraid of holding a referendum? He must know that the 
overwhelming majority of the people will insist that the holding of the 
accountability process must be completed, and that the guilty politicians 
should be disqualified, or convicted, before any elections are held? But 
does he know that the majority of the people find many of the present 
caretakers unacceptable? He could easily replace them and appoint men in 
whom the people have confidence.
    
Is it not high time that the country is cleansed? We have a sensible army 
chief who does not want martial law, we have an assertive judiciary which 
wishes to do right by the people. If Nawaz is brought back, the economy 
will not improve, there will be mass robbery. A hung parliament will breed 
acrimony, it will not usher in prosperity. Within six months there will be 
chaos, and 58(2)(b) (or worse) will again come into play. Both he and 
Benazir have had their chances and failed. Enough is enough.
    
The clamour for accountability is gaining ground every day, growing 
stronger as the accountability process of these caretakers falters and 
fails. Let there be a team change and a referendum.
    
I ask the constitutionalists of the country: do they want a constitution or 
do they want a country?

<a name="avip">A VIP speaks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafizur Rahman

I AM a VIP, and that is why I am more qualified than an incipient 
politician like Imran Khan to define what is the VIP culture. I think hes 
got it all wrong and made a hash of it when asked by pressmen to say 
something about it.
    
This was a fortnight ago. The Lahore Diary of Dawn reported Mr Imran Khan 
telling a meeting in the Lahore Press Club that if somebody had money of 
his own and could maintain himself in luxury, he saw no harm in it. There 
is nothing wrong if I purchase a Mercedes every day if I can afford it, he 
added.
    
I and some other VIP friends laughed at his words. I was reminded of a news 
report that when challenged for jumping a traffic signal, a truck driver 
tried to run over the traffic policemen. He was a VIP in spirit. The point 
is how did he get to the stage where he thought he could by-pass the law?
    
Let me say that the VIP culture doesnt merely mean using that over-rated 
facility called a VIP lounge at the airports. With rare exceptions, 
everyone of us in Pakistan is trying day and night to occupy positions 
where the law should think twice before touching them and where they can 
enjoy extraordinary privileges.
    
For instance, having moved in the corridors of power for long years, I have 
the confidence that I can get away with anything short of murder. And even 
that is manageable if I have the money to supplement my clout otherwise. It 
gives me a great feeling of security. No wonder that other people, less 
fortunate than I am, are working hard to take a seat beside me in this 
special enclosure.
    
As a VIP I belong to that category of citizens who are absolutely sure that 
if they ever take the law into their own hands they will not come to any 
harm. We have the confidence that the law will take us into its gentle 
hands as if it was our godfather. For example, I am not bothered either by 
traffic signals (like that truck driver in Lahore) or the constable blowing 
his whistle on me.
    
If I am not able to get a court of law to dislodge a truculent tenant from 
my property, I take half a dozen obliging toughs to the place and throw the 
tenant and his family and furniture out on the road. If there is a vacant 
municipal lot adjoining my house, I appropriate it without the slightest 
compunction.
    
My son aged eleven, drives a car and runs over people (even the traffic 
police) with impunity. My elder son wields a gun in college and was 
rusticated once, though the principal too had to suffer a transfer. (I had 
forgotten the boy had become so big. I hardly ever see him).
    
My daughters father-in-law is a secretary in the provincial government, 
and my sister is married to a federal joint secretary. My elder brother is 
a budding industrialist and close to the caretaker prime minister. As for 
politicians, there are quite a few in the family and come and go with the 
ebb and tide of governments.
    
So you see how well-connected I am? Besides I know a whole lot of people in 
the right places. The law is not the only thing which holds no fear for me. 
I am certainly not a common citizen in respect of many other privileges. If 
I need cement or steel or bricks for building a house I know where to get 
them cheap  and quickly. I dont have to stand in a queue to pay my bills 
or get my servants identity card made or to have my passport renewed.
    
Almost regularly, every three years or so, I am allotted a plot on the 
basis of the fact that neither I nor my wife and children own any urban 
property in any part of Pakistan. If my college-going son takes a pot shot 
with his gun at a member of a rival student gang, I know a couple of 
newspaper editors who will ignore the ugly news. The police, of course, I 
can well look after and keep it eating out of my hand.
    
I am also what is known as a prominent and respectable citizen. If I am a 
senior bureaucrat I join that assembly as soon as I retire from service; 
meantime I have the best of both the worlds. The most enjoyable privilege 
attached to the appellation (of prominent citizen) is that I get invited to 
all sorts of places  from a reception for a foreign head of state to the 
long line which accords a warm welcome to our own President and PM when 
they return after conquering hearts in foreign lands.
    
I am regularly invited to the Horse & Cattle Show in Lahore, and even once 
made it to a meeting of intellectuals called by a prime minister to find 
out the countrys pressing problems. I am available 24 hours of the day to 
the APP to give a favourable comment on the national budget or anything 
done by our top government leaders to promote democracy or demote it.
    
All this gives me the well-deserved feeling that I am the governments son-
in-law, to use a crude Punjabi phrase. It also makes me aware of my 
inherent birthright to get things free. When cinema-going was common, I 
never bought a ticket, nor do I buy one now for any play or show or 
entertainment.
    
I always say that whether I go to a function or not is immaterial, but I 
have a right to be invited, especially if I am a senior officer or 
connected in any way with the ruling regime. I cant tell a cricket match 
from a matrimonial match, but you will see me in the VIP enclosure whenever 
the MCC or any other CC is around. I simply love these invitations and keep 
them on the mantelpiece of my drawing room till they can be replaced by 
others.
    
With all these rights and privileges and contacts and relationships and 
facilities and amenities within my grasp, why should I have to bother about 
the law and its piddling concerns? After all I am not a dacoit or a highway 
robber (even though I have robbed banks in my own legal way) that the 
minions of law and order should be allowed to spoil my peace of mind.
    
And if the rest of the city is trying to emulate me and, in that process, 
it is jumping traffic signals and running over constables (like that 
enterprising truck driver) its not my fault. All I can do is to wish them 
luck in their endeavours to match my good fortune.
    
So, friends and countrymen, heres wishing you a Happy New Year, and may 
you soon become a VIP and join our fraternity. Itll be nice exchanging 
views with you.

<a name="corr">Corruption in high places</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Zia-ul-Islam

AT a time when the entire nation is up in arms against corruption, 
specially corruption by rulers, this might be the right moment to suggest a 
one-item agenda to the caretakers whereby they can effectively and 
permanently solve this problem.
    
Rulers, elected or otherwise, do not operate in a vacuum; they simply 
cannot indulge in corruption alone. The question is, How do rulers indulge 
in corruption? Through whom do they take illegal gratification? Who 
negotiates and accepts money on their behalf and who signs official papers 
in return for which the graft money is paid? The answer to all these 
questions is one and the same, the civil servant.
    
This is also the clue to the solution. At present if a civil servant 
refuses to oblige, he is transferred with the stroke of a pen and another 
one posted in his place who complies. Imagine a scenario where such a 
transfer cannot take place. Where a civil servant refuses to perform an 
illegal act and still continues in the post, it would be impossible to 
carry out the act. On the other hand, however, what if the civil servant 
willingly becomes party to the illegal act? This is, of course, the more 
likely scenario, so the solution must also contain concrete measures to 
prevent this from happening.
    
The only solution for minimising corruption, therefore, is to insulate the 
civil servant from all kinds of influences. On the one hand, his posting, 
transfer, punishment and promotion should be done, not by the rulers but by 
commissions and tribunals which are completely free from the influence of 
rulers as well as from personal greed. On the other hand, in order to 
ensure that this insulation does not allow him to indulge in corruption the 
fear of God should be instilled in him to such an extent that he does not 
succumb to any temptations.
    
In short, the endeavour should be to make the civil servant fearless, 
honest, non-compromising and a strict follower of the Book.
    
Such a clean bureaucratic environment can be gifted to this nation only by 
a caretaker government, which has no axe to grind and whose main goal is to 
clean up the country of corrupt practices. No other government, elected or 
otherwise, is likely to have the will or the inclination to introduce such 
a system, wherein the rulers are unable to misuse bureaucrats for their own 
personal ends at the expense of the pressing needs of the country. Given 
the will, this system can be brought about by adopting the following means:
    
1. Let all appointments be made through independent commissions. Let no one 
have the powers to take out any posts for whatever reasons from the purview 
of the commissions. The chairmen and members of these commissions should be 
appointed through procedures similar to those followed for the appointment 
of supreme court judges, including the condition that once appointed for a 
fixed tenure, they would neither be eligible for any extension or 
reappointment or for any benefit from the government, nor would any one 
have the authority to remove them except by the same process of impeachment 
as is laid down for the President and the Chief Justice.
    
Let us have such commissions all over the country at all levels and let us 
pay them more than handsome salaries. The expenditure incurred on such 
commissions will be millions times less than the money lost through the 
wrongly recruited people chosen by the rulers. We must remember that proper 
recruitment is the key factor in preventing corruption and misuse of 
powers. A person recruited for wrong reasons is not only a source of all 
kinds of evils during the tenure of those who appoint him but also for 
another forty years during which he continues in government job. 
Commissions will ensure all appointments to be on merit and through written 
tests. Appeals against the decisions of the commissions will be heard by 
specially constituted benches of high courts and supreme courts.
    
2. A set of tribunals, again consisting of chairmen and members like those 
mentioned above, should be formed to carry out continuous accountability of 
bureaucrats at all levels. Any one hurt by a decision of a civil servant 
should have the right to directly approach a predesignated tribunal, which 
could provide immediate relief to the petitioner within a month. 
Accountability can only be carried out by an outside agency which is 
completely free from inducement and threat. All the existing instruments of 
accountability like anti-corruption departments, inspection teams, special 
cells, etc. have failed because they are part of the same set of rulers and 
bureaucrats whose misdeeds they try to examine.
    
3. All postings of grade 17 and above as well as others which are important 
in any respect (of which a list should be prepared), should be made for 
fixed tenures of two to three years. No one should be transferred from a 
post before completion of the tenure except for a wrong doing for which he 
or she should be duly punished. If a government servant is transferred 
without proper reason, or otherwise, victimised by any one including the 
government, he should be free to get relief from the tribunals mentioned 
above, again, within a month.  4. All important posts should be filled only 
with officers who are specially recruited for the purpose. The so-called 
horizontal movement has done more harm to the country than any other single 
policy. Whatever may have been the possible advantage of such a policy in 
the minds of its formulators it has been abused so thoroughly that its only 
use is to get lucrative postings by people who know little about the basics 
of a job.
    
5. Let there be competitive tests for all posts which are sought after 
ranging from that of the SHO to the federal secretary. Anyone who aspires 
for such a post, and belongs to the requisite service may appear in the 
written test meant for this purpose. Those who qualify shall have their 
career planned in a systematic way so that each one remains in designated 
position for the fixed tenure one after the other. Thus, most people will 
know well in advance where they would be posted, ending uncertainty to them 
as well as to the public.
    
This would put an end to the ruthless race among bureaucrats for important 
positions.
    
Some of the above measures may appear drastic and unworkable. The strongest 
argument against them would be that they would create friction between the 
rulers and the bureaucracy. Yes, they would, but at this point of time in 
the nations life, we must choose between a smooth, corrupt system and a 
rough, honest system.
    
The fact is that most of the measures suggested are practicable and in 
vogue in many countries. In essence they aim to provide a set of civil 
servants at high places who will find it impossible either to be in 
collusion with the rulers in doing anything illegal, or to indulge in 
corrupt and illegal practices. To start with, some of the measures can be 
put into practice straight away in the case of federal secretaries, where 
most crucial interface between rulers and bureaucracy takes place. The 
caretaker government alone has the courage and the ability to introduce 
this system.

<a name="worl">World Cup fiasco in Bangalore eclipsed Pakistans successes</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

The defeat in the World Cup quarter-final and that too against India at 
Bangalore on March 9, completely eclipsed Pakistans otherwise excellent 
performance in the year that included victories in four Tests against just 
one defeat in seven Tests and winning of three one-day international 
competitions out of five.
    
Pakistan had entered the World Cup being the defending champions. But the 
first setback they suffered was the defeat in the third round match when 
South Africa beat them comprehensively. That defeat affected their standing 
in their group and after finishing second ahead of New Zealand, England, 
United Emirates Cricket Board and Holland, made a trip to India to play the 
quarter-final where India were waiting for them having finished third 
behind Sri Lanka and Australia and ahead of the West Indies, Kenya and 
Zimbabwe.
    
It was Pakistans first visit across the border in seven years and in the 
background of victories in Sharjah competitions over India and other 
political tensions between the two countries, they were welcomed by a 
hostile and unfriendly crowd. If those pressures were not enough, Wasim 
Akrams withdrawal from the crunch match only 15 minutes before toss left 
cricket fans and follows, in this part of the world bewildered.
    
Against all odds, Pakistan enjoyed dictating terms in the first 42 overs of 
the match restricting India to around 200 for four before the advent of 
Ajay Jadeja who launched a blistering attack to collect around 120 runs in 
the last 10 overs including 57 in the last four. Pakistan chasing, 288 to 
win, were off to a flier reaching 113 for one in the first 15 overs but 
Aamir Sohails lack of concentration, lop-sided team planning which saw 
Salim Malik and Javed Miandad come out at No. 5 and 6 respectively and rank 
bad batsmanship by Ijaz Ahmad and Inzamamul Haq saw the defending champions 
crash out for 248.
    
Ardent aficionados of the game in Pakistan could not accept the defeat in a 
contest of fluctuating fortunes and levelled serious allegations against 
Wasim Akram with one of them filing a writ petition in the Punjab High 
Court. In disappointment and desperation they burnt effigies of the 
players, made threatening calls at their residences besides pelting stones.
    
The Indians, who enjoyed every moment of the momentous victory, touched 
rock bottom a few days later when their semi-final match was awarded to Sri 
Lanka after people broke loose watching India slump to 120 for nine while 
chasing 252 for victory. It was the worst-ever crowd behaviour which 
spoiled and stained the sporting traditions of Calcuttas huge crowds.
    
Though Pakistan crashed out of the World Cup, cricket fever in the country 
didnt subside. On March 17, an overflowing pro-Sri Lanka crowd at the 
flood-lit Qadhafi Stadium saw their favourite side lift the World Cup. Sri 
Lanka beat Australia in the final by seven wickets and settled the scores 
with the Australians who along with the West Indies had refused to play 
league matches in the Pearl Island.
    
Putting behind the defeat in the World Cup, Pakistan travelled to Singapore 
where they won their first one-day competition in two years defeating India 
in the league match and Sri Lanka in the final. But their inconsistency 
cost Pakistan dear when a week later they failed to reach the finals of the 
Sharjah Cup. South Africa, on their first visit to the desert city, 
clinched the top honours beating India.
    
The Pakistan cricket team left for England in late June to play three Tests 
and as many one-day internationals hoping for the best. And the best 
followed. Pakistan defeated England in two Tests to salvage some pride and 
confidence that had been woefully wounded.
    
Inzamamul Haq and Ijaz Ahmad, who had fared badly in the World Cup were 
once again on the rampage when they scored heavily along with Saeed Anwar 
while Waqar Younis bamboozled the Englishmen with his speed and Mushtaq 
Ahmad mesmerised the hosts with his crafty leg-spinners. Moin Khan and 
Salim Malik also made valuable contributions in the second and third Tests 
respectively but there was no significant joy for Aamir Sohail, who missed 
most of the matches because of injury, and skipper Wasim Akram, who was 
lacking fitness after two months of absence from competitive cricket.
    
Immediately after their return from England, Pakistan team left for Canada 
for the inaugural Sahara Cup against India. Despite difficult conditions 
and hectic travelling schedules plus the absence of Inzamamul Haq and 
Mushtaq Ahmad, Pakistan overpowered India 3-2 in the five-match series.
    
*From Canada, Pakistan came back to Karachi and after a six-hour stint in 
transit flew off to Kenya leaving behind an injured Aamir Sohail. To cop 
the misfortunes Wasim Akrams father suffered a heart attack and he had to 
rush back leaving the Pakistan team visibly weakened. Natures Law of 
compensation, however, came into play when Shahid Khan Afridi hammered a 
blazing 100 runs knock in 37 bowls that helped Pakistan beat Sri Lanka and 
qualify for the final against South Africa where they were soundly beaten. 
Nevertheless, considering a host of handicaps it was a commendable 
performance.
    
Pakistan played two Tests at home against Zimbabwe winning by 1-0 and 
followed up this success with a clean sweep in the one-day series.  The 
home team went to Sharjah and after winning the three-nation event, came 
back with New Zealand for the two-Test series. The New Zealanders dealt a 
telling blow when they won their first Test in Pakistan in 27 years at 
Lahore. Pakistan were, however, quick to regain their composure and 
levelled the series 1-1.
    
Pakistans cricketers are currently in Australia and have so far won and 
lost a game against Australia and the West Indies respectively. The World 
Series competition restarts on Jan 1. Individual achievements:
    
Hasan Raza became the youngest Test player at 14 years and 237 days when he 
played against Zimbabwe at Faisalabad. Raza broke Mushtaq Mohammads record 
who had played his first Test in 1958-59 at Lahore against the West Indies 
at the age of 15 years and 124 days.
    
Shahid Khan Afridi slammed a 37-ball 100 in his second one-day 
international to eclipse Sanath Jayasuriyas record of a 46-ball 100 
against Pakistan in April. Afridi also established a new record of 11 sixes 
in his 102.
    
Saeed Anwar became years highest one-day scorer getting 1,576 runs while 
Aamir Sohail completed his 1,000 runs in a calendar year for the second 
time in three years.
    
Wasim Akram, besides completing 300 wickets in both Tests and one-day 
internationals, scored his Test-best 257 against Zimbabwe at Sheikhupura 
that included record 12 sixes. He established a new world record 
partnership of 313 runs for the 8th wicket with Saqlain Mushtaq (79).
    
Mohammad Wasim, a Pakistan Under-19 captain, registered a century on his 
debut against New Zealand at Lahore but failed to save Pakistan from 
defeat.
    
Paceman Mohammad Zahid became the first Pakistani to claim 10 wickets or 
more in his debut when he captured 11 wickets in the second Test at 
Rawalpindi against New Zealand.
    
Saqlain Mushtaq, the promising 20-year-old spinner, became the leading 
wicket-taker of the year when he finished with 65 wickets from 32 games.
    
These outstanding records were, however, marred by an ugly episode when 
Pakistan Under-19 player, Zeeshan Pervaiz was charged in Jamaica, West 
Indies, for raping a 36-year-old mother of three. The case is still in the 
Jamaican High Court and Zeeshans first hearing is on Jan 6, 1997.

<a name="afte">After cloudy patches a silver lining on the hockey horizon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef  Jafri

The year that is passing out had been a  mixed one with reference to 
hockey.
    
While the national outfit struggled to find its identity after the Atlanta 
Olympic reverse, the silver medal at the recent international competition, 
the 18th Champions Trophy, gave hope for the future as the team fought with 
a never-say-die spirit at an alien venue with the atmosphere usually 
discomforting for Pakistan.
    
The SAF Games debacle in Madras late last year had triggered panic among 
the hockey officialdom as manager Rasheed Junior and coach Saeed Khan left 
their posts just when the planning for the new season was to start. The 
breach was filled by Col Mudassar Asghar, Secretary of the hockey 
federation and an Olympian of the 1976 Games, and Manzoorul Hasan, one of 
the most reliable deep defenders of yore. Both spared no effort to fashion 
a side good enough to regain its place in the elitist group of hockey 
nations even though Shahbaz Sr., a noted dribbler, had decided to abstain 
from camp training and dropped out of the squad preparing for a pre-Olympic 
invitational tournament in Atlanta. The hard work at the clinic paid 
dividends since at the Georgia six-nation contest, a test of the surface 
for the Olympics, the combination claimed victories over Argentina, 
Britain, the USA and exhibited the wit and imagination to snatch the top 
honours from India on increased points. The result was an affirmation of 
the nations steady progress in the game and revived hopes for a high 
placement at the Atlanta Games. This was in April.
    
In the same month Muhammad Nawaz Tiwana was formally elected president of 
the hockey body, taking the reins of the federation for the second time. A 
strong disciplinarian and believing to always have a ringside view of the 
hockey scene there was optimism in the air. However, just to upset the 
arrangement and perhaps due to political and executive interference Air 
Vice Marshal Farooq Umer staged a comeback as PHF Chief for a term lasting 
up to the Olympics. The decision was rubber-stamped by the Executive Board 
without any dissenting voice.
    
Though the AVM had been brought in to continue the building-up process of 
the squad and to further intensify the training for the European tour and 
later the Olympiad, it proved to be a bleak period. Conspiracies and 
politics compounded the problems. On the day of the final trials 24 of the 
32 probables, led by Shahbaz Ahmed Senior, refused to come onto the field 
and revolted, putting forward certain demands, which included the removal 
of the manager and the coach. Under the constitution this was a prerogative 
of the Council. The selectors and other hockey officials, including the PHF 
president, were in a quandary as to how to cope with this unprecedented 
situation. Even the Senate and National Assembly Sports panels were 
involved to sort out the crisis in an Olympic discipline. Ultimately Col 
Mudassar Asghar stepped down as manager, keeping only his post of hockey 
secretary, and coach Manzoorual Hasan too voluntarily kept himself aside, 
both taking the decision in the interest of the game and with the Atlanta 
Olympics so near.
    
The PHF chief had no alternative but to give an immediate charge of the 
trainees to former Olympian Samiulllah and invite Jahangir Butt, another 
ex-Olympian, to assist him. Samiullah, who was then managing the second 
string in Singapore in the Asian Juniors Cup, had to rush back to Karachi 
for the more onerous assignment. The former speedy left winger returned 
with his confidence perked up as the juniors had ascended the podium in 
Singapore with the Asian juniors cup in their grasp.
    
Ten days of training were wasted and the camp commandant and coach could 
conduct the drills for only a week as the selected squad had to proceed to 
Europe for participation in two warm-up tournaments.
    
Both Milton Keynes, England, and Amstelveen, Holland, presented odd moments 
of disquiet to the Pakistan officials as in the two competitions the 
national conglomerate submitted to the Dutch and German tactical ploys and 
could not finish above Britain. In Amstelveen Pakistan were put out of 
their stride in the opening match by Britain but in the play-off for third 
spot later their trustful sallies proved to be the saving grace and helped 
them gain the third position.
    
Shahbaz Ahmad had been axed from the main outfit for the Olympics. However, 
he was rushed to Atlanta, the PHF head considering his individual forays as 
essential for the teams forward-line. The cut-off date for the lists of 
the competing teams had passed but a request was made for his induction 
into the side which as a special case was accepted.
    
Pakistan opened the Olympic schedule on July 20 with an authoritative 4-0 
victory over USA. The Americans, having appeared five times in Olympic 
field hockey were practically new-comers after the modified rules. They had 
no clue to the left side thrust of Pakistan, engineered by Shahbaz Sr. on 
the inside. He displayed his wares well. However, in the very next match 
Spains vibrant approach gave little chance to Pakistan to settle down. 
Their defence was well organised and as soon as Shahbaz tried to sneak into 
the Spanish area he was ambushed. Spain thrashed Pakistan by three clear 
goals showing the advantages of team-work, instead of individual dribbles 
and dodges howsoever elegant they may be.
 
Defending champions Germany, which did not have a good tournament, played a 
proper game with adherence to skill, to dismantle Pakistans confused 
tactics by a margin of 3-1.
    
Contrary to what was expected the India-Pakistan match did not touch great 
heights. Breakaway raids from the right side by the Indian duo of Dhanraj 
Pillay and Mukesh Kumar did not help their cause. Besides, Pillay was 
usually leaving his appointed place and was trying to run up and down on 
the left flank. The cohesion and order in the Indian outfit vanished. The 
Pakistani formation should have exploited the Indian flaws but their game 
plan too was clumsy; nothing went right for them and so the match ended as 
a goalless draw.
    
None of South Asian sets demonstrated the true Oriental style in which 
attack draws its strength from the support of the middlers and the mobility 
and centres of the wingers give a horrid time to the rival defences. A poor 
feature of the sides was their corners.
    
Later Pakistan earned a consolation win over Argentina.
    
Pakistan recorded a victory over Britain to hold for a brief period a fifth 
spot on the competition table. South Korea three days later pumped in three 
goals to Pakistans one to push the latter to the sixth place. There was 
order in South Korean play. Their tackling was strong; there was directness 
in their moves. They could not have been worn down by haphazard and 
inconsistent efforts.
    
The final 6th place, which Pakistan attained, was the worst in her hockey 
history and beat the Seoul Olympic record where the country was fifth. A 
battered and demoralised side returned home. Perhaps the power base again 
shifted to Europe. Two combatants of the Occident, the Netherlands and 
Spain, proved that fitness, vigour and speed were more important in modern 
day hockey. In a battle of corners with Spain, the Netherlands won the day 
at Atlanta and for the first time took the gold. Australia got the bronze 
medal.
    
Three months after the Olympics Nawaz Tiwana was formally installed as PHF 
president on Oct 12, his predecessor having tendered his resignation after 
damaging the countrys hockey image to a considerable degree.
    
Before the new incumbent took charge the juniors participated in a 
tournament in Vught, Holland, and clinched the trophy, through a golden 
goal against the host side. Earlier they had smothered the challenge of 
Germany.
    
The success of the juniors pleased the hockey enthusiasts as it were they 
who were to strengthen the base of the countrys hockey.
    
As was expected Tiwana restructured the selection committee with Mir 
Zafrullah Khan Jamali, caretaker Chief Minister of Balochistan and a former 
Aitchison College and Punjab University blue, as its chief and Islahuddin, 
a famed right winger and ex-Olympian, as a new member. Without much loss of 
time Dr Tariq Aziz, captain of Mexico Olympic team, was assigned to take 
charge of the managerial functions for preparing the team for the 18th 
Champions Trophy. His team-mate of the same Olympics, Jahangir Butt, was 
given the onerous responsibility of coach.
    
Just after the National Championship in Lahore, which was won by the senior 
string of PIA, the probables were called to the clinic in Karachi. Since 
there was more stress on training schedule and discipline no ugly incident, 
like the May-June revolt, recurred. No foreign trips had been arranged 
before the Champions Trophy but the camp commandant and coach wanted 
strenuous workouts and a new-look side for Madras, which was a difficult 
place for the Pakistani contingent, having lost to India a year before in 
the SAF Games. The technocrats saw to it that the players shook off a good 
measure of lethargy and diffidence that was seen at the Olympics. Two 
senior players, Mohammad Shahbaz Junior and Tahir Zaman, opted out due to 
injuries and yet the selected squad, a blend of youth and experience, was 
full of zest and determination as it reached India for the last global 
competition of the year.
    
The first match in the Champions Trophy against the Netherlands came as an 
upset for Pakistan lost it by 20. However, they soon settled down and 
showed traces of authority while whipping Australia.
    
The national outfit called the shots for the major part of the fixture 
against Spain and led by 2-0 up to 10 minutes before the final hooter. Yet 
the advantage was frittered away and Spain, Olympic silver medalist, 
levelled the scores as the end came.
    
Many thought that perhaps Pakistan was out of reckoning in the tournament 
and they can hardly pull themselves out of the tight spot. But the team had 
the fervour and guts to defeat Germany, always a strong team, and brought 
down India in a crunch encounter before their own howling and shouting 
supporters. The Indians tried hard to put pressure on Pakistan in the last 
moments of the match but the Pakistani rearline stood firm to beat back the 
Indian sallies. It was sweet revenge against India for the defeat in the 
SAF Games.
    
In the final against Pakistan, the Olympic winners Holland exhibited 
methodical efficiency at the start and took a 3-0 lead but the former came 
back into the match with plenty of zeal and resilience. The Dutch advantage 
was cut to 3-2 before the lemon time. The second session went barren for 
the Dutch to lift the Champions Trophy. Pakistan clinched the silver medal 
but won the appreciation of the experts for their tactical acumen and 
fighting abilities.
    
Hopefully, the result in the Champions Trophy was a sign of resurgence, 
which many thought may not come, given the problems that had surfaced 
before and after the Olympics. The performance at Madras may have jacked up 
the morale of the players as well as the officials and the year ends with 
promising expectations for future.

<a name="jans">Jansher still the lone standard-bearer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

Pakistan enjoyed almost complete domination in the international squash 
during the year 1996 with world number one Jansher Khan bringing added 
glory and honour for the country by further extending his World Open 
record-breaking performance to eight and that too in Karachi.
    
The 27-year-old Peshawar-born Khan met the emerging world challenge single-
handed by embracing the five super series events which included the British 
Open at Cardiff, Al-Ahram International at Cairo, Qatar Open at Doha, 
Gezira Open at Cairo, and the PSO World Open in Karachi, organised by the 
Pakistan Squash Federation. By any standard it was a magnificent 
achievement by one who has established himself as a squash legend. As if to 
show that he is mortal and fallible, Janshers two years victory run was 
broken at the start of the year under review, when he lost to Englands Del 
Harris in the PSA Super series finals by 2-3 in March. It was not a super 
series event but was contested by the eight top players of the 1995 Super 
Series ranking. The foreign press looking for a change in his armoury went 
out of the way to give an impression that Jansher Khan is on the way down 
if not out Jansher, however, silenced his critics in April with a 50-minute 
straight games victory over world number two Rodney Eyles of Australia to 
win the prestigious British Open for the fifth time. Thus the reigning 
champion has reached the half way stage to equal the record of the 
legendary Jahangir Khan (Retired in 1993) whose ten successive victories in 
the British Open stay untouched. Last year, squash master Jansher Khan had 
surpassed Jahangir Khans six wins record in the Nicosia World Open and had 
expressed his ambition to set a new record also in the British Open 
provided he remains immune from injury.
    
After taking the Al-Ahram international at the Egyptian capital Cairo in 
May an almost three months rest followed when the seven time Hong Kong Open 
champion went to Hong Kong where the third super series started on August 
27. Here the defending champion tasted the first defeat in the superseries 
when Rodney Eyles won the title in straight games. Jansher, in the post 
match press conference, the Khan paid tributes to Rodney and admitted that 
he played badly and he lacked match fitness.
    
The world champion, however, took revenge of his Honk Kong defeat when he 
beat Rodney Eyles by 3-1 in the hard fought final of the Qatar Open at 
Doha.
    
The mighty Khan confirmed his continuing command during the Gezira Open at 
Cairo with a convincing victory over Rodney Eyles in straight games in 
September. But next month he suffered another lapse in New York at the 
hands of Australias Graig Rowland. He then beat Rodney in Qatar Open 
final. The Khan reached New York hardly a day earlier for the tournament 
and had no time to get himself fully settled to the new playing conditions. 
It was rather rash on his part to go for competition straight after a long 
journey  a mistake he avoided by skipping the German Masters tournament 
scheduled soon after the New York event, as hardly two weeks were left for 
the 20th World Open in Karachi. The late withdrawal resulted for zero point 
for Jansher Khan but it provided him enough time to get fully prepared for 
the Karachi World Open, scheduled from Nov 17.
    
After going through tremendous hard training under his brother coach 
Mohibullah Khan, he started the defence of his title in a confident way, 
removing his challengers Graig Wapnic of South Africa, Canadian sensation 
Jonathan Power, England Simon Parke and Scotlands Peter Nicol in straight 
games. The world champion reached the final without dropping a game.
    
He then proceeded to overpower Australias second seed Rodney Eyles 15-12, 
17-15, 11-15, 15-3 before the packed to capacity court gallery of about 700 
spectators which lustily cheered the top seed who received the glittering 
trophy from chief guest Air Chief Marshal Mohammad Abbas Khattak, President 
of the Pakistan Squash Federation.
    
Jansher, however, skipped the Mumbay Mahindra International, the last super 
series event, held in the first week of December on security grounds to the 
discomfiture of the Indian organisers and the Professional Squash 
Association.
    
As regards other squash stars, brothers Zarak Jahan Khan and Zubair Jahan 
Khan were the first Pakistanis to compete in the fourth Mahindra open. The 
24-year-old Zubair made appreciable progress in the world ranking. He has 
emerged as the best Pakistani player after world beater Jansher Khan as in 
the November PSA world ranking he is at number 16 but his elder brother 
Zarak has slipped down to 18th position.
    
The Asian champion Mir Zaman Gul is placed at 25th and Sindh Open champion 
Kumail Mahmood is at number 62 while other up and coming players are 
farther down were struggling to better their leads.
    
Zubair Jahan made a great impact in the Karachi World Open when he created 
two major upsets by defeating Englands eleventh seed Mark Chaloner by 3-2 
in the first round of 32-man draw and also beat Australias tenth seeded 
Anthony Hill by 3-2 in the second round match, marred by unsporting conduct 
of the Australian who hit Zubair.
    
Zubair lost the Marathon quarterfinals by 2-3 against Rodney Eyles. He is 
currently ranked number 11 in the PSA Super Series Standings announced 
recently and his ranking in the World too is bound to improve when it will 
be announced in the first week of January, 1997.
    
At the Asian Level also Pakistan dominated championship winning both the 
individual and team events held in Amman, Jordan, in January. Pakistan won 
the team title defeating Hong Kong by 3-0 in the final with Mir Zaman, Gul, 
Zarak, Zubair forming the team after Jansher returned home from Amman with 
trouble in the back.
    
Mir Zaman Gul emerged Asian champion overcoming Hong Kong challenger Abdul 
Fahim by 3-2 in the final, lasting two hours 15 minutes.
    
In the world juniors Pakistan secured the third position, an improvement 
over its previous showing at number five in the World juniors (under-19) 
championship at Cairo. But we have yet to win back the juniors team and 
individual title for well over a decade. Moreover in the individual events 
none of our seven youngsters, who competed in Cairo, could reach the 
quarter finals.
    
This indicates low competitive standard of our juniors, despite the fact 
that they get all possible facilities and encouragements by the PSF which 
were not available in the past. It also shows that juniors are not fully 
committed to hard training which they badly need. The competition at the 
All-Pakistan scale has increased. The holding of full PSA sanctioned 
international tournaments, two in Lahore, and one each at Peshawar and Wah, 
in which foreign players also compete, is considered highly beneficial for 
our players for improving their world ranking.
    
Besides international tournaments, events on all-Pakistan level are also to 
be held this year. Participation of world champion Jansher, Zarak Jahan 
Khan, Zubair Jahan Khan, Mir Zaman Gul and others would go a long way to 
help the youngsters to gain experience by playing against world class 
players in the local competitions.
    
Regarding womens squash, the national championship had been revived over 
two years ago but it should be backed by holding more tournaments at the 
divisional and provincial levels which at present remains wanting.
    
Let the PSF and its affiliated units work out a more comprehensive 1997 
programme, particulars on the juniors level, for spotting talented 
youngsters, available in every part of the country. The affiliated units of 
the Federation have to play a more positive role for the games promotion.
    
As the year ends, the one vital question that remains unanswered is who 
will be the successor to world champion Jansher Khan, whom we wish a long 
career in the game where he remains number one.
