<a name="paki">Pakistan to attend Delhi talks with open mind</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, March 19: Pakistan will go into next weeks crucial talks with 
India with an open and a sincere frame of mind to settle all disputes, a 
foreign office spokesman said.
    
The spokesman said: We hope to discuss all outstanding issues during the 
talks including Kashmir. We are not thinking of agreements at the present 
time.   We will probably start by deciding on an agenda and format for 
discussion.
    
He said the Indian response to Pakistani gesture will also be in the same 
spirit because negotiations were a recognised way to solve the issues.
    
Foreign secretaries of Pakistan and India are scheduled to meet on March 28 
in Delhi.  Pakistan has always been desirous of co-operative, tension-
free, good neighbourly relations and we feel that this is the historic 
opportunity to make a beginning, the spokesman said in his opening remarks 
at the briefing.
    
He declined to reveal what might be Pakistans new strategy at the 
resumption of talks. 

Answering questions from the news persons, the spokesman denied that there 
was any external compulsion on Pakistan to reopen negotiations after the 
stalemate overtook them about three years ago.   We have agreed to 
(resume) these talks to establish our good intentions and we are going to 
these talks with that intention, he added.
    
The spokesman recalled various statements of the prime minister on the need 
to resume bilateral talks with India and said we have a new government in 
Pakistan which has committed itself to improve relations with India and to 
make attempt to solve outstanding problems.
    
The spokesman conceded that some Indian public statements tended to vitiate 
atmosphere for talks but he advised against taking all such public 
pronouncements on their face value.
    
Commenting on reported demand by the leadership of the APHC (All Party 
Hurriyat Conference) representing the freedom fighters in held Kashmir to 
be associated with the talks on Kashmir issue with India, the spokesman 
said the people of Jammu and Kashmir had been recognised internationally in 
the United Nations resolutions, as a party to the dispute. 
   
He assured that their views and choice would be taken in deciding the 
dispute at the appropriate time.
    
Replying to another question, the spokesman referred to the prime 
ministers letter to his Indian counterpart, in which he clearly stated 
that some progress on Jammu and Kashmir issue, is a pre-requisite for 
initiating discussion and progress on other issues with India.
    
About the Indian reluctance to permit a delegation of the APHC to attend as 
observer at the OIC Islamic Summit in Islamabad in celebration of 
Pakistans fifty years of independence, the spokesman said that should 
expose the Indian authorities attitude towards Kashmiri Muslims.
    
The spokesman said that Pakistan had asked the Indian High Commission in 
Islamabad to make necessary arrangement for travel and repatriation of 38 
Indian minor detainees who had been recently released unilaterally by 
Pakistan on humanitarian grounds. 
   
There were about 200 detainees in Pakistan and India including fishermen 
and persons suspected of security and criminal offences, whose release on 
reciprocal basis was being worked out, the spokesman disclosed.

<a name="pmhi">PM hints at cut in taxes, duties</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 17: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has said that the rates of 
Income Tax, import duties and tariffs will be rationalised to stop tax 
evasion and corruption and enlarge the tax base, Press Assistant Siddiq-ul-
Farooq told reporters after the meeting.
    
The Prime Ministers Tariff Reforms Commission, headed by MNA Ejaz Shafi, 
in its report had recommended to the government to bring down the maximum 
tariff from 65 percent to 45 percent and impose only 5 percent import duty 
on primary raw materials.
    
Nawaz Sharif, the spokesman said, told the meeting that businessmen, 
industrialists and common people were willing to pay the taxes provided 
their rates were justified. Rationalisation of taxes will result in 
enlarging the tax base and generation of revenues, the prime minister told 
the meeting.
    
He said Nawaz Sharif was briefed on the budgetary situation, the balance of 
payments position and issues connected with foreign and local debt. He said 
Nawaz Sharif exhorted the economic experts to utilise their full energies 
to take out the country from the present economic mess.
    
Nawaz Sharif also directed them to work for reviving the sick units so that 
exports could be increased and the gap between  imports and exports be 
bridged.
    
The spokesman said the prime minister also set up a committee to recommend 
steps for making the 33 state-run corporations economically viable. He said 
the committee head and its members will be announced by Finance Minister 
Sartaj Aziz on Tuesday. The committee will submit its report to the prime 
minister within 15 days.
 
He said Nawaz Sharif also directed to gear up the privatisation of the 
state-run industries in a transparent manner.  The prime minister 
announced that all revenues generated from the privatisation will be used 
for debt retirement, the spokesman said.
    
The banks and development financial institutions were also directed to 
support the agricultural sector to boost agricultural growth.

<a name="pmss">PMs scheme not to solve problems, says US paper</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NEW YORK, March 19: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs debt retirement scheme 
will not solve the countrys economic problems despite the fact that over 
100 million dollars have poured into the scheme since it was launched, says 
the Wall Street Journal .
    
In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz 
admitted that the debt retirement scheme at best, is only a stopgap thing, 
to get Pakistan through its next few repayment deadlines. However, he 
declared that the clouds have lifted, the Sun is streaking in, the shadows 
have gone, and we are much better.
    
The article titled A Break in the Clouds Over Pakistan? contends As 
impressive as that is (DRS), it represents only a drop in a very big and 
leaky bucket.
    
Laying out the economic woes confronting Pakistan, the WSJ says Pakistans 
foreign debt stands at $30 billion, outstanding domestic debt was over $22 
billion in February, Pakistan was looking at debt repayment bills through 
March about equal to its liquid foreign reserves of $750 million dollars. 
And compounding the problem is the black shadow of the International 
Monetary Fund, and a fiscal deficit reduction target of 4 percent of gross 
domestic product that was agreed to back when the former government of 
Benazir Bhutto duped Pakistans creditor-disciplinarians into believing 
that the deficit was only 5.8 per cent. Since truth a figure of 6.5 
percent-became known, the very real threat of IMF pulling the plug has had 
some people pulling up ringside seats for one spectacular crash, observed 
the Journal.
    
However, WSJ writes that Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz, while acknowledging 
that no way Pakistan can meet the four percentage point reduction target, 
said that he can get the deficit down by 1.8 percentage points  the degree 
of reduction the previous government promised when it was giving 
misleadingly lower figures to the IMF.
    
ECONOMIC REFORMS: Mr Aziz said in the interview: The government of 
Pakistan intends to dazzle the IMF and the world with a package of banking 
reforms, tariff reductions and sweeping institutional changes to increase 
tax collection, develop the secondary capital market and prune back the 
regulations that are suffocating businesses and breeding corruption.
    
Mr Aziz said that at the end of this month, Pakistan would announce a 
master plan for transforming the country within 18 months into a new Asian 
destination for investment. But the journal notes that As much as theyd 
like to believe that, most Pakistanis are sceptical as the average 
outsider, its a shame that insular, communist Vietnam generates more 
economic excitement than open-armed, capitalist Pakistan.  But Vietnam has 
not seen a half dozen changes of government in as many years, is not 
flanked by war-torn Afghanistan and hostile India, and it is not routinely 
in the news for outbreaks of sectarian violence and other products of 
Kalashnikov culture.
    
Nevertheless, the WSJ points out: Whats different now is that for the 
first time in half a century of nations existence, Pakistan elections have 
produced a government with parliamentary majority so large that there is 
almost no limit to what that government can accomplish if it tries, adding 
indeed, with no significant domestic constituency to block reform, the 
only thing standing in the way of major progress would seem to be bad 
habits.
    
On the policy side, the WSJ says that Mr Sharifs team appears to know 
what is wrong and how to fix it. For instance, it says that Finance 
Minister Azizs single greatest concern is not the IMF but Pakistans sick 
manufacturing sector. Annual export growth which had averaged 7 per cent 
over 30 years slumped to less than 1 per cent in 1994-95 and then has not 
risen over 2 per cent. Up to 5,000 industrial units have closed down, 
ranging from textile plants with 14,000 spindles and 1,000 employees to fan 
assembly lines of 50 people.
    
Mr Aziz told the journal that until and unless the exports pick up, 
nothing else he does will save the situation.
    
On the causes of economic decline in Pakistan, the WSJ says that they are 
the same all over: Heavy industrial taxation at every level can put a tax 
burden of 60 per cent on some products; high raw material costs because of 
devaluation and expensive money, in a system which is all but squeezed dry 
by governments borrowing.
    
As to how Mr Sharifs government would reverse these trends, Mr Aziz says 
You just remove the fiscal anomalies. For instance, he says: Pakistan 
has local demand for 600,000 television sets a year, but the domestic 
producers can hardly compete with 200,000 Sony sets smuggled yearly across 
from Afghan border and through other channels where no import duties apply. 
The solution will be to lower the duty and impose a retail sales tax 
instead across the board.
    
On the question of finding capital, Aziz admits Its true the government 
has been pre-empting a much larger share of the credit market. But that 
doesnt mean that there is not enough money for the private sector. Aziz 
feels that the problem is that we lack a developed secondary market to 
mobilise private savings and get the government out of the business of 
finding money for public and semi-public enterprises.
    
The journal says that Pakistan may have to wait much longer for an upturn 
in foreign investments. Foreigners will move in only after Pakistanis have 
signalled their confidence, or lack of it, in the new government.

<a name="cabi">Cabinet decides to hold census</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 19: The federal cabinet decided to hold the much-delayed 
housing and population census all over the country.
    
The prime ministers adviser on information and media development, Mushahid 
Hussain, told a briefing that the prime minister had asked the chief 
ministers to send in their proposals for holding the census which had been 
put off several times due to political controversies.
    
The last one was held in 1981 and though it is a constitutional requirement 
to hold a population census after every 10 years, the successive 
governments have been deferring it on one pretext or the other. The PPP 
government had held a housing census in 1994 but did not make the figures 
public after reports of massive irregularities in Sindh. The PML government 
would now hold the housing count afresh Mushahid Hussain said.

<a name="viol">Violations of press freedom in Pakistan: report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NEW YORK, March 15: The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists 
(CPJ) has, in its annual report, decried  the dramatic deterioration in 
press freedom conditions in Pakistan since 1995 , particularly in Karachi.
    
In its annual worldwide survey of press freedom violations entitled 
Attacks on the Press, the CPJ cites the arrest and detention of the daily 
Dawns sub-editor Sheikh Aziz and beating up of Aftab Syed of the News, as 
glaring examples of the declining press freedom in Pakistan.
    
The committee which has many luminaries of the American media on its board 
 Walter Cronkite, Peter Arnett (CNN)  says the deterioration in press 
freedom in Pakistan began when ethnic and sectarian violence in urban 
centers worsened and the then prime minister Benazir Bhuttos Peoples 
Party started to impose bans on media outlets, which continued through 
1996.
    
The CPJ report said: The press conditions were even worse in the rural 
areas of Pakistan, where journalists encountered unchecked abuses of power 
by local government and feudal lords who act with virtual impunity. The 
federal government, the report said, effectively facilitated and 
sanctioned the intimidation of the journalists by introducing an ordinance 
that allowed the provincial governments to use army and paramilitary 
rangers for law and order purposes, including arrest and interrogation.
    
Specifying a typical case of dangers that the rural journalists face in 
their areas, the CPJ report notes that police and others severely beat 
Monnis Bokhari, a reporter for the daily Sindh in Dokri, after he reported 
that a member of the Sindh provincial government had illegally purchased 
land belonging to the Sindh Forest Department.
    
The report says that elsewhere in Sindh province, men employed by a local 
landlord kidnapped and sexually assaulted Mumtaz Sher, a correspondent for 
daily Bakhtiar, after his newspaper published an article about alleged 
misconduct by a senior school administrator who is also the landlords 
wife.
    
In Asia, the report says, India sought to contain separatist movements in 
the north-west by gagging the press. It also contends that 185 journalists 
in 24 countries were in prison at the end of 1996 and 27 were killed in the 
line of duty.

<a name="newl">New law bans meal serving at weddings</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali 

ISLAMABAD, March 15: The federal government banned lavish meals, fireworks 
display and illuminations at weddings and allowed serving of hot or cold 
drinks only.
    
An ordinance promulgated by the president imposed a fine of Rs100,000 to 
Rs300,000 on the violators. 

The ordinance has empowered the provincial governments to constitute an 
Ehtesab committee for each sub-division, Tehsil or taluka which would be 
responsible for the implementation of the ordinance. No court would be 
competent to take cognisance of the offence under this ordinance except on 
complaint in writing by the Ehtesab committee.
    
The ordinance prohibits the decoration or illumination of any house, 
building, street, road or any other place. It also bans fireworks and 
firing in the air.
    
An ordinance promulgated by the president under clause (1) of Article 89 of 
the Constitution of Pakistan expires after 120 days if it is not re-
promulgated or made an Act of Parliament. If the same draft of ordinance is 
converted into an Act of Parliament it would remain in force for two years.

<a name="lhcb">LHC bans cigarette ads on radio, TV</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Reporter

LAHORE, March 21: The Lahore High Court On Friday barred Pakistan 
Television and Radio Pakistan from relaying cigarette commercials and 
programmes which might induce people to smoke. The order will take effect 
from April 1.
 
However, the court allowed for a period of three years cigarette marketing 
during live telecasts of sports events sponsored by tobacco companies, 
provided the commercial did not show a person smoking and was followed by a 
warning against smoking.
   
Radio will only be allowed to relay a statement mentioning the name of 
sponsors during sports commentaries.
    
Radio and television will be able to seek an extension of the period, which 
ends on March 31, 2000.
    
The directives were issued by Justice Mohammad Aqil Mirza in a short order 
while accepting a writ petition filed by the Pakistan Chest Foundation and 
the Pakistan Anti-Tuberculosis Association.
    
After hearing arguments from both sides, the court concluded that cigarette 
advertisements induced younger people to smoke and that freedom of trade 
and business was not violated by prohibiting such advertisements on the 
electronic media.
    
The court relied on reports prepared by the Pakistan government and the 
World Health Organisation stating that the number of smokers had increased 
in countries like Pakistan where there was no ban on cigarette 
advertisement. In a report, the director-general of Pakistan Health 
Services stated that smoking caused different kinds of cancers and lung 
diseases. The WHO report mentioned smoking, in any form, as a major cause 
of premature deaths.

<a name="imfc">IMF cancels loan, sets terms for new accord</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, March 21: The International Monetary Fund has cancelled the 
stand-by arrangement worth 850 million dollars and has made future lending 
conditional on Islamabad bringing about some basic structural reforms.
    
The week-long negotiations between the IMF and a Pakistan government team 
ended here on Friday on the note that the Fund could consider a new 
agreement on the extended structural adjustment facility (ESAF) and 
extended fund facility (EFF) but that, too, only when the government of 
Pakistan had given what the IMF called a viable policy package. According 
to finance sources here, the prime minister is likely to announce a package 
in a weeks time.
    
The sources said the IMF had expressed reservations at Pakistans inability 
to meet various targets agreed to by Islamabad earlier. Since Pakistan has 
not been able to achieve its revenue target during the eight months of the 
current financial year, nor has it been able to control its budget deficit 
or the current account deficit, the sources claimed, the IMF has refused to 
release the third tranche of 76 million dollars under the SBA (stand-by 
arrangement). Earlier, the SBA had been stretched from 600 million dollars 
to 850 million dollars, out of which Pakistan had already received 326 
million dollars.
    
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz conceded at a news conference on Friday that 
the SBA had been cancelled but said the government was now interested in 
signing a new agreement on ESAF for 1.2 billion dollars. Why should we get 
loan under SBA and pay 6per cent interest and why not to have ESAF on 0.5 
per cent interest rate, he said. Mr Aziz said the government could still 
manage without the 76 million dollars from the IMF.
    
Asked how would the government meet its debt liabilities till June, the 
finance minister said the government had already mobilized 134 million 
dollars under its debt retirement scheme. He said thus it had double the 
amount it would have received from the IMF. There is nothing to be worried 
about, he remarked.

Sen Aziz said he did not believe that the IMFs refusal to offer anything 
under the SBA would hurt Pakistans credit rating position. IMF executive 
director Abbas Mirakhor, who represents Pakistan on the Funds board, was 
present at the news conference.
   
He expressed satisfaction with the governments determination to implement 
its economic reform programme. I am quite certain that the new government 
in Pakistan would be able to present an economic package that would surely 
improve its credit rating position in the world. Mr Mirakhor said the SBA 
was a target-oriented short-term programme of the IMF and that he hoped 
Pakistan would be able to do good with the new ESAF arrangement.
    
Answering a question, the finance minister claimed that there was no danger 
of default in debt repayment. He also denied that Pakistan had any plan to 
request the Aid to Pakistan Consortium to reschedule its debts. He said 
Pakistan expected to have 1.2 billion dollars from the consortium which was 
to meet in Paris on April 21 and 22.  At the moment we do not have any 
programme to seek rescheduling, he declared.

<a name="tige">Tigers  Asian and global</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
R.M.U. Suleman

DESPITE continuing precariousness of Pakistans forex reserves and mounting 
debt burden, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been much encouraged by the 
success of his appeal for foreign exchange donations and loans from 
Pakistanis, particularly those residing and working abroad. He has been so 
encouraged by this response that he has expressed the hope that it would 
not be long before Pakistan becomes not only an Asian but a global economic 
tiger.
    
Simultaneously, Indian Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted 
that his country would be as combative as the rest of Asias Tiger 
economies within the next four years. Mr Chidambaram added he was aiming to 
accelerate the countrys gross domestic product growth from seven to eight 
percent.
    
The minister, widely applauded for unveiling a tax-cutting budget, told the 
Asia Society conference that India will Asianise herself and become as 
combative as any other Asian nation within four years.
    
Mr Chidambaram, whose budget cuts in income tax, corporate tax and tariffs 
and excise duties had delighted business leaders and corporate investors, 
has aimed at achieving eight percent growth annually by 2000 AD.
    
Chidambaram told the conference there had been scepticism, suspicion and 
doubt over Indias government. Earlier, Finance Secretary Montek Singh 
Ahluwalia said the budget for the fiscal year to March 1998 was not a 
Christmas tree which has a gift for everyone, but argued it would pave the 
way to major reforms. He said the countrys current fiscal deficit, at 
around six per cent, would fall to under four within two years.
    
In India as well as Pakistan, investment exceeds savings and results in the 
piling up of debt, domestic as well as foreign. The lagging of savings 
behind investment is sharper in Pakistan relative to India.
    
Quick at the heels of his resounding election victory, Mr Nawaz Sharif 
vowed to lure foreign investors back to the country. The economy is in bad 
shape. We have to reverse the trend, said Mr Sharif.
    
A darling of the business community, Mr Sharifs family owns the Ittefaq 
industrial conglomerate, one of the countrys largest with interest in 
metal, sugar and textiles. He was swept to power on promises that he would 
reinvigorate the economy and rid the country of its reliance on overseas 
donors such as the IMF.
    
The economy needs to be turned around. The first thing to do according to 
Mr Sharif is to create an investment climate to get rid of debts and debt 
servicing, he said.
    
Before the elections, Mr Sharif promised incentives to attract foreign 
investors and raise some $30 billion through privatisation to repay foreign 
debts. But no political leader is ready to touch defence spending, which 
takes around 40 percent of the $14.2 billion budget, citing a perceived 
security threat from rival neighbour, India. This spending is the main 
generator of the budget deficit and the debt, local as well as foreign.
    
Last December, the IMF approved an increase in credits for Pakistan due to 
the economic measures approved by the interim Pakistani government. 
Disbursements had been interrupted last year in the face of what the fund 
called slippages in the implementation of economic reforms agreed to by 
Ms Bhuttos former government.
    
In the wake of the election victory, Mr Nawaz Sharif claimed that he had 
plans to break the countrys begging bowl. Word had also gone round that 
the new government may scrap the agreement with IMF, particularly the 
portion relating to cutting the budget deficit to 4 percent as against the 
revised target of 5 percent suggested by the new government. Mr Sharifs 
government has, however now compromised with bitter economic truths and 
realised that the generosity of overseas Pakistanis and of Pakistanis 
keeping huge deposits abroad are not easy alternatives for subservience to 
IMF.

<a name="huma">Pakistan and its human development strategy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Syed N Zafar Majid

PAKISTAN is among those few countries in the world which show a wider gap 
between their investment in physical production and their investment in 
human capital.
    
The adult literacy rate of 36 percent is 33 percentage points below the 
average for all developing countries (69 percent). Its net enrolment in 
basic education is around 50 percent compared with 100 percent in China and 
Sri Lanka, 97 percent in Malaysia and 68 percent in India.
    
Pakistans per-capita income compares favourably with those of China and 
Sri Lanka. But on the human development index, Pakistan ranks 132, compared 
with 90 for Sri Lanka and 94 for China. In adult literacy, Sri Lanka has 
already reached 89 percent and China 80 percent compared with Pakistans 36 
percent despite similar per capita incomes.
    
Despite Pakistans income being much higher than Indias, its people suffer 
much greater human deprivation because personal income is unevenly 
distributed and because in Pakistan, governments have consistently 
neglected  the provision of basic social services.
    
Pakistan is 70 percent ahead of India in its real income, according to 
World Bank estimates, but far behind in human development. Its adult 
literacy rate is 36 percent compared with Indias 50 percent. Its combined 
enrolment at all levels is 24 percent compared with Indias 50 percent; and 
its access to safe drinking water is 50 percent compared with 75 percent in 
India.

Human deprivation
    
The magnitude of human deprivation in Pakistan boggles the mind: 55 million 
people have no access to safe drinking water or primary health care 
services; 95 million are deprived of sanitation services; 35 million people 
are below the absolute poverty line, with limited access to even the very 
basic needs for human survival; 42 million adults are illiterate, two-
thirds of them women; 4 million children under five are severely 
malnourished.
    
Pakistan is simply not prepared nor is it preparing for the technological 
challenges of 21st century. It spends only $3 per capita on real human 
priority concerns, compared with $133 in the Republic of Korea, $123 in 
Malaysia and $9 in India.
    
The neglect of Pakistans human resources arises from a feudal society that 
places a low value on the lives of the ordinary people except at election 
time.
    
Pakistan needs to spend a minimum of 10 percent of its GNP on the provision 
of basic social services to its people, particularly education and health, 
whereas at present the country is spending around 3 percent of its GNP on 
these sectors. The size of allocation, even after the launching of the 
Social Action Programme (SAP), remains unclear.
    
Though it is possible that the budget provision may have increased to over 
5 per cent of GNP. Still, at least a doubling of current allocations is 
called for. This will be impossible if debt servicing continues to consume 
more than 6 percent of GNP, defence spending consumes another 7 percent and 
if the tax revenue does not rise above 14 percent of GNP. If social 
expenditure is to have its rightful place in the national budget, rather 
than remain a mere residual, a complete restructuring of fiscal management 
is required.
    
Pakistan is spending 125 percent as much on its military as on the 
education and health of its people.

Change wanting
    
According to the Human Development Report, just one years purchase of arms 
by Pakistan is equivalent to a sum that could have provided safe drinking 
water for about half the countrys population or extended basic education 
to all children currently out of school.
    
Of course, Pakistan cannot unilaterally undertake a reduction in military 
spending. A SAARC agreement on joint reductions in military spending is 
needed so that no nation within the region is put at a comparative 
disadvantage.
    
Since Pakistans budgetary resources will remain tight, it needs to squeeze 
the maximum mileage out of its funds. This means giving a greater priority 
(and subsidy) to basic education rather than to university buildings, to 
primary health care rather than expensive hospitals, to cost effective 
community water taps in rural areas rather than to piped water in high-
income urban neighbourhoods. 
   
It is the poor who need government patronage, not the rich, who can afford 
to pay for the services they get.

<a name="inte">Internal, external threats to economic self-reliance</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Mahnaz Fatima

WHILE MANY in the country were yearning for the government of Pakistan to 
adopt an approach towards economic self-reliance, as that is also a pre-
requisite for putting the country on the road to true national economic 
development, a lot of vested interests might try to obstruct the plan and 
the process, that the current elected government and the committed quarters 
will need to guard against.
    
For, it is in the interest of many that Pakistan remains economically 
dependent on the First world as national economic dependence, in turn, 
leads to the continued subservience of the majority in the country to a few 
who remain connected to the developed world.
    
Also, many others might oppose this approach as the above goal implies that 
all the haves in the country would need to contribute their due share to 
the economy which they would much rather withhold to keep their tribe/ 
clan/groups economic power consolidated.
    
It is little wonder then that we already see a pro-IMF sentiment creeping 
in again with our rating with the IMF projected as something that is 
essentially required for our credibility with the external lenders as 
though Pakistan is destined to survive only with the help of external 
borrowings.
    
Rumours of default are again being spread, with Credit Lyonnais declaring a 
90 percent probability of default. It was encouraging to note that local 
analysts disputed it and reduced the probability to 10 percent.
    
However, it is analysis and views such as the ones above that did serve to 
dampen the buoyant stock market and the positive sentiment that was 
initially displayed towards the National Debt Retirement Programme (NDRP). 
Pakistan would have raised much more by now under the NDRP than has been 
raised so far had it not been for the dampeners that have been floated as 
mentioned above, for, it is only through the above route that Pakistan can 
acquire staying power in the short run and a reasonably strong negotiating 
position with the IMF as, inter alia, a departure from IMFs 
conditionalities is essentially needed to again prime the economy.
    
As explained in an earlier article, a turn-around in the disposition of 
Pakistans business community, as demonstrated through the NDRP, augurs 
well for their future positive business disposition which, if it 
materialises, should enable Pakistans economy to turn the corner.
    
A pre-requisite, however, is that Pakistanis should be able to develop a 
thinking and analytical capability independent of foreign and domestic 
vested influences without which we, as a nation, will continue to waver 
when the need of the hour is to demonstrate a resolute will and 
determination.
    
At this point, it is important to briefly recapitulate the role of the IMF, 
on which I have dwelt upon considerably in some of my other articles. It 
needs to be understood that it is the First World interest that the IMF is 
out to promote and this promotion might be done at the expense of our 
national interest as has usually been the case.

IMFs machinations
    
So, while IMFs response would determine our countrys international credit 
rating in the short run, we must not forget the role that the IMF played in 
Pakistans most recent political and economic history.
    
The IMFs reluctance and delay in releasing the desired tranche to 
Pakistans last elected government of Benazir was one of the factors that 
had led to the rapid erosion of business confidence and panic in the 
countrys stock and currency markets.
    
This paved the way for an elected governments dismissal and induction of a 
caretaker government whose economic management team could be easily seen as 
one comprising Bretton Woods yes-men. The IMF hesitated little in 
releasing the tranche to this team of caretakers even though the economic 
performance was just about as dismal.
    
At that time, the IMFs stated intent was to bail Pakistan out of its 
economic crisis. And, we had then wanted to know the reasons because of 
which the IMFs desire to bail Pakistan out was not so strong when an 
elected government was in office as much as it was when the office came to 
be occupied by an interim government of caretakers dominated by Bretton 
Woods connections here or abroad.
    
So, those who advocate strict adherence to IMF conditionalities are either 
unclear about the role of the IMF and its impact on Pakistans economics 
and politics. Or, the IMF protagonists belong to that group of economists 
in the country that have been consulting with the World Bank and, 
therefore, toe the IMF line.
    
There is, therefore, a need to understand the role of the IMF in Pakistan 
as adherence to its conditionalities and inability to negotiate with the 
IMF keeping national interest in mind, has done the country more harm than 
good.
    
If the role of the IMF is clearly understood, then patriotic citizens will 
have little reason to sneak in the pro-IMF sentiment or raise alarm bells 
at the slightest objection from the IMF unless they will have vested 
interests.

Fifth columnists
    
In addition to the World Bank-connected Pakistani economists, there are 
other groups within the country who would prefer to have the country rely 
on foreign economic assistance rather than mobilise domestic resources as 
they are reluctant to either contribute to the countrys economy or slash 
their not-so-needed expenditures. Of these groups, the most noteworthy 
would be the feudals, those businessmen and industrialists who wish to 
continue to evade taxes and return borrowed money, and the establishment.
    
As also mentioned in a recent letter to Dawns editor, feudals have yet to 
begin contributing meaningfully to the NDRP. Their reluctance in 
contributing to this national cause only highlights the class cleavage in 
the country. So much for the patriotism of the feudal class. Also, as for 
the agricultural income tax, while some feudals no longer oppose it as 
there are not enough reasons for this opposition to continue, many would 
still continue to resist it. This would continue to provide a reason for 
businessmen and industrialists to continue to evade taxes and default on 
loans although, with a leader from their community now occupying the 
highest government office, the business/ industrial community should be 
providing leadership in turning around the economic behaviour patterns in 
the country.
    
These thorny issues of internal resource generation, followed by 
reinvestment within the country, need to be resolved essentially to enable 
Pakistan to embark on its second phase of the journey to economic self-
reliance. And, the current elected government needs to give them high 
priority and put them on top of their economic agenda. However, the 
business class is now expected to blaze the trail in this direction which 
will eventually coax the feudals to fall in line or get even more exposed.
    
The establishment might pose yet another potential hurdle towards the goal 
of economic self-reliance for some reasons that cannot be stated but known 
to all and some others that can.
    
First, we have a bureaucracy full of Anglophiles, USphiles, or more 
appropriately Westophiles and is actually one of the countrys worst 
colonial legacies. The elected government should expect resistance from 
within the bureaucracy itself as many bureaucrats have been the 
beneficiaries of innumerable foreign training programmes funded either by 
the World Bank or other bilateral donors which have further galvanised 
their Westophilial tendencies.
    
A concept as indigenous as self-reliance will sound too desi and, thereby, 
repugnant to mentally enslaved bureaucrats already sold on the idea of the 
global village and blurring of international economic boundaries.
    
The above tendency might be compounded by the caretakers desire, expressed 
through a person no less than the President himself, that Pakistans 
economic interest necessitated close adherence to IMF vis-e-vis adherence 
to the terms of agreement. For, if he does and finds the Nawaz Sharif 
governments economic policy audacious, then problems can compound.
    
As it is, a rift between the President and the Prime Minister is being 
denied and one can only hope that their is truth in these denials. For, if 
there is truth in the rumours regarding a rift, then one can only urge the 
President to let the elected government exercise the mandate that the 
people of Pakistan have given it.
    
To cap it all, a senior member of the US government has reportedly urged 
the elected government to follow the caretakers policies which centred 
around total submission to the IMF. Such a signal from a member of the US 
government is indeed ominous and is in fact interference in Pakistans 
internal affairs.
    
With such glaring internal and external threats, the Nawaz Sharif 
government will surely be fighting a besieged battle towards the cherished 
goal of economic self-reliance. However, drawing support from the heavy 
peoples mandate, the battle can still be fought successfully if the 
government remains aware of the pitfalls and alert to the road mines.
    
It will also need to tread cautiously, ensuring that it does not invite 
heavy criticism that would weaken its case for self-reliance. For example, 
already eyebrows might be raised at the action against those who were 
recruited in the last three years as they too are jobless citizens of this 
country in dire need of jobs; at the arbitrary diversion of Rs 700 million 
from the PSDP to the motorway project; and at the quiet increase in 
electricity charges at 2 per cent a month and levy of 10 per cent excise 
duty on gas when the PM and the Petroleum Minister had earlier given a 
decision to the contrary.
    
Decisions such as the ones above could be best avoided especially when 
there are many in the field still who would want to see the elected 
government lose to yet another dictatorial set-up and prematurely.
    
So, the need of the hour is a clean government operating in a manner that 
would invite the least criticism or else, the vested interests within the 
country and abroad might again. God forbid, have the better of yet another 
elected government of Pakistan.

<a name="want">Wanted: instant remedies for sagging exports</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

WHILE Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is appealing to Pakistanis overseas and 
at home, to come up with contributions to reduce the large national debt 
and improve the foreign exchange reserve, the more crucial foreign trade is 
again showing very adverse trends that can aggravate the balance of 
payments crisis.
    
The export performance during the first eight months of this financial year 
is hardly better than in the same eight-month period last year which ended 
with a record trade deficit of $3.33 billion.
    
Against the export growth target of 14.4 percent set for the current year, 
the rise in exports until February is only 5 per cent and there are small 
prospects of a substantial rise in exports before the end of June unless 
very extraordinary measures are taken.
    
What is disheartening is that the 13 percent devaluation of the rupee 
effected in the first half of this year in the hope of boosting exports has 
not paid dividends, except briefly when exports went up. It has however 
helped to reduce imports. While the target for the rise in imports this 
year is 5.3 percent the rise in the first eight months has been only 3.32 
percent over the same period last year.
    
With the trade deficit at $2.32 billion for the first eight-months which is 
hardly better than the $2.36 billion deficit in the first eight months of 
last year, the $10 billion export target initially set is far off, and even 
the new target of $9.2 billion appears too elusive.
    
Undeterred by such factors the new commerce minister, Ishaq Dar, spoke last 
week of raising the export this year by 30 percent and doubling exports 
soon. He did not specify how he would achieve that.

Devaluation fears
    
The Economic Committee of the Federal Cabinet discussed the external trade 
crisis on Tuesday but could not come to conclusion. Instead it decided to 
analyse the reason for the stalemate.
    
The persisting large trade deficit along with the larger balance of 
payments gap in the current account which was $4.2 billion last year is 
spawning fears the government may resort to further devaluation of the 
rupee. Foreign securities agencies have already begun forecasting it.
    
The advice of Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia to its clients says, 
underlying the current account deficit is a burgeoning trade deficit, 
estimated at a current monthly average of $250 million. The dip in the 
December trade deficit to $160 million was short-lived as it rose quickly 
again to $375 million in January.
    
Pakistans export base is narrow and is, therefore, unlikely to respond in 
tandem with the government policy which promotes domestic demand and as a 
consensus imports. The fast growth strategy would put huge pressures on the 
external accounts at a time when Pakistan forex finances are precarious, to 
say the least, it says.
    
While this report is rather racy, the fact remains that Pakistan has been 
running a monthly trade deficit of $300 million for the last eight months 
with the average of exports at $637 million and average of imports at $937 
million. If the average deficit had followed the target of two billion 
dollars deficit for the whole year it would have been $160 million dollars 
and not $300 million.
    
The narrow export base of Pakistan with its dependence on cotton and 
cotton-based products stand in the way of Pakistan reaching the target of 
$10 billion, for the revised target of $9.2 billion after eight months 
could achieve only $5.34 billion exports in the face of $7.664 billion 
imports.
    
Cotton has failed as a significant export item because the current years 
output of 9.1 to 9.2 million bales leaves hardly any exportable surplus. 
Cotton export this year so far has been only worth $7 million vis-a-vis 
last years $550 million. This is because even though cotton traders are 
free to export whatever quantity they get hold of, domestic prices are far 
higher than international ones and more exports are out of the question. A 
cotton grower gets at least Rs 200 more than the international market. 
    
A substantial sudden devaluation of the rupee after creeping devaluation as 
done last year has again proved to be counter-productive for accelerating 
exports, as happened after the massive devaluation of the rupee resorted to 
in 1993 by the caretaker government of Moeen Qureshi. Exports fell by two 
per cent at the end the year after a 10 per cent devaluation in July and 
August, 1993.

Imports prices up
 
Devaluation of the rupee enhances the rupee prices of all imports, 
including machinery and spare parts, industrial raw materials, and 
chemicals. It also increases of price of POL, gas, power and 
transportation. And import and excise duties increase along with the 
devaluation. In a country where 45 per cent of all imports are industrial 
raw materials, devaluation of the rupee pushes up the prices of all exports 
and refund of the taxes paid on exports take a long time to materialise at 
a time of very high cost of money. So devaluation of the rupee as a major 
tool for boosting exports in Pakistan has failed again and again, while it 
has only helped to repress imports and domestic consumption only to some 
extent.
    
Credit Lyonnais overshoots its mark when it talks of the government 
promoting domestic demand and as a consequence imports, when through 
sustained devaluation of the rupee, higher and varied taxes, including the 
latest 2 per cent on imports subject to pre-shipment inspection, makes all 
consumer goods more and more costly, and those who cannot obtain goods 
through the normal channels buy smuggled goods.
    
The right approach to increasing Pakistans exports is to reduce the cost 
of production which means reducing the cost of the inputs of production.
    
However, if their costs go on rising as in the case of agricultural 
products like cotton. If the energy costs go on increasing and along with 
that the cost of transportation following rise in POL prices, if wages rise 
in relation to productivity due to too many holidays and break-down in 
production following electrical loadshedding and interests cost are high, 
and even the export credit at 13 per cent is high compared to the interests 
rates in other countries, the devaluation of the rupee has to become 
counter-productive and the efforts to step up exports less rewarding in 
spite of large official investment on export promotion.
    
A major pharmaceutical company chief says he exports medicines worth Rs 25 
million to Bangladesh but he is hoping that at cost as the cost of 
production is high here. He is hoping that sometime such exports may become 
profitable and the export incentives would be improved.
    
Exports have fallen far short of the targets as export of guar and guar 
products have dropped by 17.6 percent, surgical instruments by 12 percent, 
vegetable exports 10 percent and leather exports by 4.17 percent. However, 
the export of value-added in the textile sector has improved to the extent 
of 37 per cent for ready-made garments, synthetic textiles by 34 percent 
and cotton fabrics by 12 percent and towels by 6 percent. But they could 
not pull up the exports overall beyond a 5 percent vis-a-vis the 14.4 
percent target.
    
On the import side, while Pakistan will be importing 2.4 million tonnes of 
wheat, following last years imports for $444 million the import cost of 
POL has shot up following the rise in world oil prices. Sugar imports are 
also rising and may touch half-a-million tonnes and fertiliser imports too 
are substantial. What has not been rising is machinery import as banks are 
tardy with their investment loans.
    
In the earlier years, Pakistan could reduce its balance of payments deficit 
by adding the large home remittances to the export earnings. But since the 
home remittances peaked at $2.88 billion in 1992-93, they have been falling 
and came down to $1,467 million last year. The projection for the current 
year is $1,200 million. Some of the remittances may now be directed towards 
the prime ministers debt reduction fund and hence the amount which goes 
into the kitty of the State Bank may be small.
    
There are no quick fixes for increasing exports after the hobby horse of 
devaluation of the rupee as the principal instrument for that has failed 
again and again in our environment. The remedy has to be comprehensive and 
aimed at reducing the cost of production, improving quality of the 
products, and increasing the efficiency and ethical level of business 
practices.
    
Pakistan has to diversify its exports instead of cotton and cotton products 
forming over 60 per cent of the exports. Export of non-traditional items 
has to be increased through organised methods and the value-added has to 
become a far larger part of the exports.
    
Some of the 11 working groups set up by the prime minister after the 
Businessmens Convention are grappling with such issues and we have to see 
their recommendations and the extent of their acceptability to the 
government. Some of their recommendations in the fiscal area may have to 
await the new budget. If that happens Pakistans exports may not average 
about $962 million a month which is needed on the next four months to reach 
the current years target.
    
This is a very critical year for exports in view of the acute balance of 
payments problems and Pakistans capability to achieve large results within 
a short time is very limited because of the excess of fiscal and monetary 
constraints which are likely to stay for some more months at least.

THE FORMATION of coalition government in Sindh provided the much-needed 
push to an uncertain market as investors were back in the rings after mid-
week and made an extensive short-covering at the lower levels.
    
The KSE 100-share index staged a smart recovery during the last two 
sessions of the week as after having fallen to as low as 1,545 points, 
finally managed to finish at 1,590.83 points as compared to 1,591.50 points 
a week earlier as most of the shares came in for strong short-covering 
after the formation of the Sindh government.
    
All the leading shares participated in the run-up but the bulk of buying 
remained confined to PSO, Fauji Fertiliser, Engro Chemicals, which posted 
gains ranging from Rs 4 to 5. Most of the textile shares also showed good 
rallies thanks to active short-covering at the lower levels and rose under 
the lead of Gadoon, Saif and Mehmood Textiles. Bank shares also came in for 
active support at the lower levels and finished recovered, major gainers 
among them being Bank of Punjab, and Faisal Bank.
    
Bonus shares at the rate of 20 percent by IGI Insurance for the last year 
pushed its share higher by Rs 3 on active buying. Adamjee Insurance, which 
was under pressure in line with the general trend also recovered by Rs 3.
    
Other dividends, notably from Al-Faysal bank and Reliance Weaving at 15 and 
10 per cent respectively were well-received in the rings and so were the 
7.5 and 5 per cent from Gulistan Textiles and its OE shares.
    
The mid-week rally after the formation of Sindh government was led largely 
by leading bank, insurance, synthetic, cement, energy and most of the 
chemical and pharma shares.
    
The market sentiment in part was also influenced favourably by revival of 
foreign demand on most of the MNCs at the lower levels, which attracted 
good sympathetic short-covering from others.
    
Losses on the other hand were mostly fractional and reflected slack demand 
rather than large selling from any quarter. However, some leading shares, 
notably Shell Pakistan, Parke-Davis, Dewan Textiles, Sana Industries, 
Mirpurkhas Sugar and Dadabhoy Sack came in for active selling and fell 
sharply.
    
Trading volume suffered a sharp contraction owing to the absence of leading 
sellers who were not inclined to sell at the falling prices in early sell-
off and held on to their positions. The total volume fell to 190 million 
shares from the previous weeks 250 million shares.
    
Both PTC vouchers and Hub-Power remained volume leaders but early in the 
week came in for panic selling on some bad news from the foreign markets 
about GDR rates. But later short-covering allowed them to finish partially 
recovered. They were followed by Dewan Salman, ICI Pakistan, FFC-Jordan 
Fertiliser, Fauji Cement, Dhan Fibre, and to a lesser extent Bank of 
Punjab, Askari Bank, Fauji Fertiliser and several others.
    
The interesting feature was that most of the low-priced textile shares also 
came in for active short-covering and rose though by fractions but turned 
out large volume.
    
A section of leading operators is rolling positions from the overvalued 
sectors to this sector on news that export performance of this sector is 
exceptionally well and interim profits are on the higher side. Good 
dividend from some of the leading among them for the year ended Sept 30, 
1996 also provided an attractive bait for prospective investors to buy at 
the lower levels.

<a name="stoc">Stocks stage fresh rallies on active follow-up</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 21: Stocks on Friday maintained an optimistic outlook as 
share values staged fresh rallies on active follow-up support originating 
from all the quarters.
    
The notable feature was that the KSE 100-share index was quoted slightly 
above the psychological barrier of 1,600 points, reflecting the strength of 
leading index shares.

It was last quoted around 1,600.63 after at one stage touching the peak of 
1,605.00, showing a gain of 18.35 per cent or one per cent over the 
previous close of 1,582.28. The long-overdue bull-run appears to have made 
debut and there are reasons to believe that it could be sustained in the 
coming sessions too, most analysts believe.

They said opinions were still divided over the future direction of the 
market owing to liquidity problems and expensive bank credits, strong 
presence of foreign fund buying had raised hopes of a sustained run-up. 
The market needs peace in Sindh and that is there after taking over the 
government by the new set up, they maintained.
    
Bulk of the support remained confined to bank, cement, energy and most of 
the low-priced textile shares as investors made anticipatory buying on 
predictions of big capital gains in the coming sessions.

Ahmed Hassan Textiles, Ayaz Textiles, Burewala Textiles, and Fateh Textile 
were leading gainers among them, rising by Rs 1.25 to 5.

The biggest gain of Rs 41 was, however, noted in Lever Brothers which 
surged to Rs 750 on active short-covering followed by news of higher half 
year profit. Over 25,000 shares changed hands at this high level.
    
Fauji Fertilizer, Engro Chemicals and Dawood Hercules were among the other 
major gainers, rising by Rs 2.50 to 4.50, followed by IGI, Burewala 
Textiles, Husein Sugar and Fateh Textiles, which also posted gains of 
identical amount.
    
Adamjee Insurance, Askari Insurance, Siemens Pakistan, BOC Pakistan, Glaxo-
wellcome, Mitchells Fruits and Cyanamid Pakistan were among the prominent 
losers, falling by one rupee to Rs.6.
    
Trading volume fell to 33.452 million shares from the previous 41 million 
shares, while out of the total 311 actives, 161 shares rose, 89 fell, with 
61 holding on to the last levels.
    
PTC vouchers again topped the list of the most actives, up 40 paisa on 
8.445m shares, ICI Pakistan, higher 75 paisa on 6.113m shares, Hub-Power, 
firm 10 paisa on 4.388m shares, Dewan Salman, higher 85 paisa on 2.537m, 
shares, Dhan Fibre, steady 20 paisa on 1.628m shares, and D.G.Khan Cement, 
up 80 paisa on 1.195m shares.
    
The other actively traded shares were led by Fauji Cement, firm 20 paisa on 
0.837m, Maple Leaf Cement, up 35 paisa on 0.271m, Chakwal Cement, unchanged 
on 0.246m, Nishat Chunian, higher Rs 1.25 on 0.159m and Askari General 
Insurance, up Rs 2.35 on 0.108m shares.

<a name="jinn">Jinnah, the film </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

IS IT malice, or envy, or ignorance, or the woman scorned syndrome that 
makes you write so irresponsibly, in an effort to hinder the making of the 
Jinnah film? I asked my journalist friend. He was shrewder than I presumed 
him to be and he answered, A bit of all.
    
Ever since the birth of Pakistan there has been a lobby of ignorant self-
opinionated prejudiced men. I call them bigots, but many of them refer to 
themselves as professors though at the most they can be termed lecturers. 
They claim to be experts on Jinnah, and have made it their mission in 
life to project the man as having been as humourless, as emotionless, as 
narrow-minded as they themselves are.
    
In his book published in 1954, Hector Bolitho, Jinnahs official 
biographer, wrote: While Quaid-e-Azam was caught up in this exasperating 
care of detail, he was also writing the greatest speech of his life. He 
would leave these fault-finding expeditions to return to his desk, where he 
worked for many hours on the presidential address he was to give to the 
Constituent Assembly of Pakistan on August 11. Bolitho went on to quote 
from that speech.
    
To illustrate how even in 1954 it was found necessary, by the very people 
to whom he had bequeathed a country, to betray the man Jinnah and his 
beliefs, I give an example of senseless censorship, the blatant twisting of 
Jinnahs creed, written and publicly declared by the great man himself.
    
Jinnah: You may belong to any religion or caste or creed  that has 
nothing to do with the business of the State... We are starting with the 
fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one 
State.
    
Bolitho: You may belong to any religion or caste or creed  that has 
nothing to do with the fundamental principle that we are all citizens and 
equal citizens of one State.
    
And what was the phrase that had to be omitted? That a mans religion has 
nothing to do with the business of the State. (We must always remember 
that on more than one occasion Jinnah had emphatically stated that under no 
circumstances was his country to be a theocracy).
    
Bolitho was unaware that the speech given to him by Colonel Majid Malik, 
principal information officer to the GOP, had been censored. Malik was a 
good man, who was later to admit that to his great regret he followed 
orders.
    
Now, as we all know, a film script is innovative. The script of the film 
now being made is at the same time cinematic, biographical, imaginative, 
historical and factual. It cannot possibly offend the sensibilities of any 
sane or balanced man, be he from Pakistan or Baffin Island.
    
Neither can the casting of the film. Christopher Lee, whose career spans 50 
years, the age of this nation, has been chosen to play Jinnah. Lee, an 
established internationally famed cinema actor, looks like him (this 
photograph was taken in Karachi a week ago) sounds like him, and is of the 
age Jinnah was when he founded this country. An actor is not selected to 
play a role on the basis of his past roles (they are irrelevant) but on the 
basis of his role suitability and his acting skills. One of Lees recent 
roles was the Duke of Edinburgh in Charles and Diana, the film made for 
British television. Anthony Hopkins, after playing murderer / cannibal 
Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs went on to play Richard Nixon, 
president of the USA. Did anyone raise a murmur?
    
Christopher Lee is here to do a job. He is naturally concerned with the 
malicious disinformation being spread in the Press, and cannot understand 
it. Of course, he cannot. No one who is not steeped in the local culture 
can make head or tail of it all.
    
Lees confusion is further compounded by the letter he received from the 
Press Secretary to the President. Dated January 28, 1997, this letter 
reads:
    
I am writing on behalf of the President of Pakistan to express warm 
gratitude to you for participating in the film being produced by Professor 
Akbar S. Ahmed on the life of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.
    
Mr Jinnah is not only the founder of Pakistan but is one of the most 
distinguished statesmen in contemporary history. Your participation in the 
film will, I am sure, embellish the production.
    
Let me assure you that the people of Pakistan deeply appreciate your 
decision. We look forward to your visit to Pakistan.
    
The feature film is being made, in 1977, on a shoe-string budget of 2.7 
million pound. To put things into perspective, the film Gandhi made in 
the early 1980s cost 27 million pound. Omar Kureishi was recently in 
Singapore where he sounded some film-makers with a view to making a film 
for one of his clients. They confirmed having just made a one-minute 
television commercial for Garuda Airlines that cost $2.5 million, and 
another one lasting the same time, with a superior cast and props, for 
Malaysian Airlines for $5 million.
    
Funds for our Jinnah film have so far been largely subscribed by Pakistanis 
living in America and Europe, who are very keen that this film about Jinnah 
be shown on the screen abroad so that people are made aware of his life and 
achievement.
    
Producer Akbar Ahmed has also made an agreement with Faruk Dhondy, 
commissioning agent of Londons Channel Four, to have the film shown in 
Britain. PTV, in the era of our last caretaker government, also expressed 
its keenness to Akbar when he was here earlier this year. Irshad Ahmad 
Haqqani, the then information minister, signed an MoU which reads:
    
Whereas the Government of Pakistan recognises the need to project the life 
and achievements of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah to the world at large 
in a proper perspective.
    
And Whereas the eminent scholar Professor Dr Akbar S. Ahmed is engaged in 
the production of such a film through a British-Pakistan venture called 
Quaid-e-Azam Project Ltd, which has wide international support.
    
Therefore, the government of Pakistan wishes to provide every moral 
support in the early completion of this Project.
    
In this regard, the Government of Pakistan will encourage PTVC to enter 
into agreement with the Quaid-e-Azam Project Ltd to provide support to be 
decided between the two parties.
    
Thereafter, the Government of Pakistan, through PTVC, on February 2 of this 
year, entered into a firm agreement whereby it unambiguously agreed to 
subscribe Rs 6 crore (950,000 pound approx). The agreement was very one-
sided, heavily loaded in favour of PTVC, which no businessman in his right 
senses should have made. In terms of this agreement, the government will 
share the profits, but will not share any losses.
    
Armed with this agreement Akbar lined up his production teams, comprising 
some 30 members from Britain and 25 from Pakistan, and signed up with 
Christopher Lee, Shashi Kapoor, James Fox, Patricia Hodge and many others.
    
Now, at this late stage when the main actors have arrived and shooting is 
well under way, a handful of dissatisfied disgruntled citizens of Pakistan 
are trying to force the government to renege on its written commitment.
    
As it is, Pakistan, through its own faults, has come to be treated 
worldwide as a joke, and in banking language it is termed not good for its 
commitments. Do we need to substantiate this view? Do we need to make the 
Indians have a good laugh at our expense? Do we wish to further confirm to 
the world that after fifty years of existence we are incapable of making an 
interesting and informative film on the creator of this country? Shame on 
us.

<a name="brin">Bring on the horses</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak        

IF you had thought the PMLs overwhelming majority in the National Assembly 
meant an end to horse-trading, you had better think again.
    
The latest round of wheeling and dealing that accompanied cabinet formation 
in Sindh is just a foretaste of things to come. By bending over backwards 
to accommodate Pir Pagaras sons, Sibghatullah and Sadruddin, the chief 
minister has sent a clear signal that he is wide open to political pressure 
and coercion. 
   
Apart from the Pagara pair, MPAs Arbab Faiz and Maqbool Sharif also sent in 
their resignations, thus pushing Sindhs fragile coalition to the brink of 
dissolution.
    
But in yet another triumph of power politics over principles, the sulking 
foursome were given what they wanted all along: lucrative portfolios of 
their choice as against the unimportant ones they had been offered 
earlier. 
   
So much for sharafat ki siyasat and the PMLs oft-stated determination to 
introduce principled politics in Pakistan. Also, if anybody still harboured 
hopes for a transformation in our polity following the February elections, 
he only has to look north to the NWFPs murky politics: there, the ANP has 
successfully blackmailed Nawaz Sharif into accepting Begum Wali Khans 
brother, Azam Hoti, into the federal cabinet. He too, will no doubt insist 
on an important (i.e. lucrative) portfolio so that he can serve us 
better.
    
I have often been accused by friends engaged in politics as a profession 
that I am much too idealistic to appreciate the compulsions they have to 
work under. Rather them than me, I reply: there should be some limit to the 
compromises slimy politicos are willing to make in order to retain their 
slippery grip on power. 
   
When it comes to greed and blind ambition, our politicians have few peers.
    
What then is the shape of things to come? The euphoria of a landslide 
victory having worn off, what are the emerging contours of Pakistans 
political landscape? Frankly, stable governments in Islamabad and Lahore 
apart, the situation in the other provincial capitals looks very dodgy. 
     
In Sindh, a weak and barely tenable coalition of the PML and the MQM will 
be forever held hostage by a handful of so-called independent adventurers 
who will exploit the prevailing anti-PPP sentiments to gouge their pound of 
flesh. With Pir Sibghatullah as minister for revenue and land utilisation, 
we can safely expect him to maximise revenues through total exploitation of 
urban land. 
    
Similarly, his partners in resignation will undoubtedly proceed to make the 
most of their important ministries.
    
The same dismal scenario will be repeated in Peshawar and Quetta. And when 
ministers are making hay, it would be unrealistic to expect their 
bureaucratic underlings to remain as pure as the driven snow. So what price 
clean government? 
   
It appears that Nawaz Sharifs brave post-election promises are proving 
hollow barely before his administration has had time to get into first 
gear. 
    
Predictably, the seemingly invincible force of a two-thirds majority has 
been stopped cold by the sleaze factor that has dominated our political and 
social landscape for half a century.
    
Although the government has been making all kinds of pronouncements and 
promises to cleanse the system, the fact is that almost all those 
politicians and bureaucrats responsible for the premature demise of the PPP 
government are still living off the fat of the land. 
    
The handful who were arrested have managed to suffer sudden but 
mysteriously convenient illnesses that have necessitated moving them to the 
VIP wings of hospitals. 
    
Accountability is now yet another discredited slogan. Given this scenario, 
what chance does Nawaz Sharif have to actually make a difference?
    
None, unless hes willing to break a few eggs to make an omelette. While 
the FIA and sundry other agencies are scouring the land for evidence of 
corruption, it stares them in the face in the form of huge houses and other 
signs of conspicuous consumption. 
    
As long as the onus of proof is on the government, it is unlikely that 
anybody will ever get convicted. However, turn the equation around and you 
can put away hundreds of crooked bureaucrats and politicos. Let them 
explain how they managed to foot the bill for the childrens lavish 
weddings, or how they built their huge and obscenely opulent homes, or how 
they paid for their snazzy limousines and jeeps. And if they cant justify 
their lavish lifestyle, they are automatically out. No appeal, no stay 
orders.
    
Granted that there is bound to be some miscarriage of justice, but hey, 
life isnt perfect. 
     
Although we seem to be on the verge of forgetting, there was a real wave of 
revulsion against corruption, and three months of caretaker raj have proved 
that conventional means of accountability simply will not do. Let the onus 
of proof be on the accused.
    
Meanwhile, life in Sindh threatens to be an action replay of the Jam Sadiq 
days: already friends with industries have reported getting threatening 
phone calls demanding political contributions. 
     
If Islamabad tries to discipline a profligate provincial government by 
cutting off funds, I can imagine a wave of threatened resignations from 
ministers whose portfolios have suddenly become unimportant. 
      
After all, the name of the game is  and always has been  money. For all 
their tall talk about serving the people, if you scratch a politician, 
youll find a bank account with its mouth wide open. Why these people dont 
find a profession other than highway robbery is beyond me. 
    
Indeed, they could even try looking for a normal life.
 
Instead, they devote all their inexhaustible time and energy to grabbing 
power, and once installed, do all they can to hang on at any cost. Given 
the amount of abuse and contempt hurled their way by an exasperated public, 
youd think that any self-respecting group would slink away and spend the 
rest of their lives in obscurity, atoning for their sins. But our 
politicians are beneath the standard notion of dignity and respect: they 
are thick-skinned enough to ignore all criticism and invective and 
cheerfully proceed along their path of pillage and loot without straining 
their conscience unduly.
    
Unfortunately, there is no legal or social deterrent to make the corrupt 
think twice before ripping us off. We have all heard slogans for change 
shouted by politicians on the eve of their oath-taking, and then seen them 
sacked on corruption charges. 
    
The crooks have prospered, and no action has ever been taken against them. 
This apparent immunity encourages others to dip into the national till, 
secure in the knowledge that they will not be touched.
    
And even if a few crooked civil servants are sacked, this will do nothing 
to deter their political masters. 
    
Given the ease with which Sindhs four rebellious ministers managed to get 
the portfolios of their choice, it becomes clear that without a clear 
majority in the provincial assembly, good governance remains a distant 
dream. 
    
Not that this one factor is any guarantee: the PPP had a handy majority, 
and yet its rule is not recalled as a model of clean government. 
nevertheless, this remains a prerequisite for a reasonably honest 
administration.
    
If things continue in the same vein in Sindh, Nawaz Sharif may have to 
think very seriously about imposing governors rule.

Omar Kureishi

PRIME Minister Nawaz Sharif has sent out an unambiguous message to PIA: 
shape up or ship out. Bombarded as he has been with advice on what should 
be his priorities, he has indicated that PIA is high on the list. And so it 
should. 
 
PIA is more than an airline. It is a part of our lives and a crucial player 
in the national economy. A troubled PIA is costly not only to itself but to 
the country, in more ways than just financial. The Prime Minister is fully 
justified in expressing concern.
    
The perception is that PIAs service standards have fallen and as a result 
it is getting considerable flak both from its customers as well as the 
media. There is concern too about the financial health of the organisation, 
not too dissimilar to the health of the countrys economy, which is 
generally agreed to be fragile if not tottering on its last legs. As if 
this was not enough, PIAs fleet is ageing and there is a compelling need 
to induct new aircraft. There is substance in the criticism that is being 
made and even PIAs own management would find it hard to put on a brave 
face.
    
PIA suffers the disadvantage that it is compared to its past, to the trail-
blazing airline that sky-wrote its name in golden letters, if I may be 
forgiven an opulent metaphor. This is manifestly unfair because then was 
then and now is now and PIA has to contend with the present realities. It 
is these realities that have to be examined if responsibility has to be 
fixed for the disarray in PIA and those obstacles removed that has brought 
a once proud airline to such a sorry pass.
    
One of the major complaints is that PIA is not only overstaffed but it is 
top-heavy. There is no one in PIA who will disagree but they will say with 
every justification that this overstaffing and a top-heavy management is 
not of their doing and even more important, not of their asking. Left to 
themselves they would downsize the airline but they are not left to 
themselves. It is no secret that PIA has been made a dumping ground for 
political appointees by successive regimes. Even certain domestic points 
have been added to its network at the behest of political masters, 
irrespective of whether they can be justified commercially.

PIA can hardly be blamed for actions that are not of their making and for 
decisions that are made for them. The irony is that whereas PIA is expected 
to compete in the international market, it is being asked to do so with its 
hands tied behind its back. PIA was meant to be a commercial organisation 
but it has been reduced to a government department. Imagine British Airways 
or Singapore Airlines or even Emirates, which PIA helped to start, having 
to function, strangulated by red tape and run de facto by remote control. 
No one expects that the National Bank of Pakistan will be as gung-ho as the 
Citibank or ANZ Grindlays. National Bank operates in a totally different 
culture. Yet we want PIA to be like British Airways or Singapore Airlines. 
Though never meant to, PIA too has been made to operate in the same culture 
as the National Bank. If PIA is to be turned around and be made a 
competitive airline, then conditions must be created for it to be 
competitive. PIA is described as a semi-autonomous organisation. The accent 
should be less on the semi and more on the autonomous!
    
This is not to absolve PIAs management of all blame. Improvements can be 
made in the service areas and in the attitude of staff who too see 
themselves as functionaries of a government department with the same 
cavalier disrespect for the public. Over the years, PIA has developed its 
own bureaucracy and this bureaucracy is no less deadly than the real one.
    
When I worked for PIA I once read the Service Code and immediately informed 
my superiors that it resembled a Penal Code. As a service code it was 
entirely negative and soulless. It needed changing. The point I wanted to 
make was the management and the employees should be seen to be on the same 
team and not have an adversarial relationship. But even then, PIAs 
fledgling bureaucracy considered such a point of view as too radical and 
cock-eyed in the bargain. PIA employees who retire or are given the boot 
are still made to go through a private hell to have their outstanding and 
dues settled. I dont think there are any restrictions on the management to 
remove these babu obstacles.
    
In other words, working conditions can be improved. Middle management 
should be encouraged to take decisions so that the level of supervision and 
monitoring is tightened. PIA needs to decentralise its management to get 
efficient. It would do wonders for the morale of the staff as well. But 
none of this would make an important difference to the overall PIA 
performance unless there is a change in the attitude of government. The PIA 
should be set certain objectives and targets and then told to get on with 
achieving them without any kind of interference. Failure to achieve these 
objectives and targets would amount to a failure of management and then 
heads can roll. But PIA cannot be expected to fly jets through rules and 
regulations that were designed for the bullock-cart. PIA should be 
encouraged to compete with the best and the word is encouraged not 
hampered.
    
There is still in PIA a hard-core of professionals who I fervently believe 
will be able to win back the trust of Great People To Fly With. At present, 
it is only an advertising slogan and a pretty old one at that. It worked 
then. It can be made to work now. PIA is not a hopeless cause. It has just 
lost its bearings and needs to be put back on course. The heart of the 
airline is sound.

<a name="prep">Preparing Karachi for 2001</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

SINDH, at last, has a cabinet following the February 3 general elections, 
and it is the largest in the country today. The MQM with seven ministers 
and an adviser with ministerial rank in charge of finance, has almost equal 
representation in the 18-member cabinet inclusive of Chief Minister Liaquat 
Jatoi, with other parties. The issue of portfolios for them all which 
threatened to disrupt the cabinet following its formation has also been 
settled.
    
There is now hope that following the return of MQM to office after five 
years, there may be peace in the city which desperately needs it to solve 
its multiplicity of problems. It is 12 years since violence began 
disrupting the city life, and ethnic conflicts became its centre-piece. The 
economic and social life of the city, estimated to have 12 million people, 
has been disrupted along with its political and civic life which had 
resulted in frequent disbandment of elected municipal bodies. Along with 
that big time crimes have been on the increase manifesting themselves in 
various horrid forms aggravating the sense of insecurity in most areas.
    
The economic life of the city which contributes over 70 per cent of the 
income tax revenues of the federal government even in its disrupted state 
needs to be rehabilitated and reinvigorated. If political violence 
aggravates unemployment, prolonged unemployment of an increasing number of 
persons as well as the sustained high inflation in a low-wage economy have 
been increasing the crimes in the city and the province. The old solitary 
burglar has become a thing of the past. What we have instead are armed 
dacoaities committed by gangs using stolen cars who are ready to shoot at 
the sight of any resistance from their victims. And few realise the role 
inflation, now officially 14 per cent and actually far higher, is playing 
in the rising violence within families where mothers are victims of 
violence spurred by unemployment as well as the sustained high inflation 
when several children have to be fed. That increases the use of narcotics 
as well.
    
The city is the victim of heavy federal taxation like sudden increases in 
sales tax and its sweeping spread through one budget after another. And for 
all the taxes Karachi pays to the Centre and Sindh government it gets very 
little in return in the form of improved services. Caretaker chief minister 
Mumtaz Bhutto had stressed several times that the province which was paying 
75 per cent of the federal taxes was getting too little in return. 
Karachis leaders and people have not been organised enough to plead their 
case strongly or fruitfully. Successive governments spoke of special 
packages for Karachi, but very little came out of them.
    
Karachi is now likely to be hit harder by some of the hobby horses of Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif. The use of green channel freely by overseas 
Pakistanis bringing in vast variety of electrical and electronic goods will 
undermine the dwindling electronic industry of the city. Already radio and 
TV manufacturers here have slashed their production sharply as they could 
not compete with tax-free imported electronics. And re-opening the green 
channel in a big way which is used by customs officers and professional 
carriers will flood the country with tax free electronics even more while 
the domestic products are heavily taxed.
    
Hino-Pak in Karachi has reported that its sales are down by 80 percent this 
year following the tax-free import of Volvo trucks from Sweden by 
Pakistanis returning home. And now Mr Nawaz Sharif talks of reviving the 
yellow cab scheme which would mean far more buses coming in the manner the 
fast-moving coaches came earlier. During his first term, bus manufacturing 
was hit hard through the import of several hundred buses by a friend of his 
from China.
    
Industry in Karachi is hit hard when not held back by violence or an excess 
of holidays as a result of prolonged and frequent loadshedding by KESC or 
the endemic water shortage. What the current power crisis in the city shows 
is that even if the output of power is increased through foreign investors, 
unless the transmission and distribution systems are proper and massive 
corruption is eliminated in WAPDA and KESC, power failures may stay 
recurrent.
    
Unemployment in the city has been getting worse owing to external and 
domestic reasons. Karachi is said to have half a million to one million 
illegal immigrants who are all employed. Efforts to round them up and send 
them away have not succeeded. Not much can be achieved in the face of 
excessive police corruption which shields these aliens. Hub was developed 
as an industrial areas with the promise of providing 75 percent of the jobs 
to the people of Balochistan. Instead, most of those employed were 
Bangladeshis.
    
Construction jobs in the city are now taken up by workers from Punjab and 
the NWFP. Domestic jobs as cooks are secured by Bangladeshis. And Sri 
Lankans and Filipino women take up womens work in homes. And the security 
jobs are secured by persons from the Frontier or retired soldiers and 
policemen.
    
Most of the Mohajirs by comparison are lower or middle class workers who 
need white collar jobs. It is industry, business and the service sector 
which can provide such jobs. But instead of these sectors expanding they 
have been stagnant or shrinking and about 1,500 industrial units are sick.
    
And now instead of increasing employment, the KDA, KMC, KESC and KWSB are 
under pressure to sack thousands of workers from each of them. Public 
sector banks and DFIs are to shed about 35,000 workers under IMF and World 
Bank pressure. PIA and Pakistan Steel face similar situation after the 
massive staff expansion under political pressure over the years.
    
Clearly new jobs in large numbers and with good pay are in the private 
sector. But they cannot come through little outfits like Modarba and 
leasing companies, with a tiny staff buttressed by computers. Instead, the 
city has to opt for large-scale industrialisation with a dynamic and 
expanding small sector and the service sector which follows an export 
sector that thrives.
    
The SITE has too many sick industries and chronically ailing textile mills. 
The Korangi Industrial estate is so polluted it is a real health hazard. It 
has 2,800 industrial units which pay Rs 200 million as tax to the Centre 
daily but the government shows scant interest in its welfare. The Korangi 
Fifth Harbour has taken ages to be completed and is yet to play its proper 
role. The Federal B. Area had about 900 small industrial units in 1994 but 
following the escalating violence hundreds of them had closed down.
    
The PPP government spoke of three industrial zones in the city in Landhi, 
Orangi and Baldia. It also proposed a Surjani Town electronic industrial 
area at a cost of Rs 200 million. But none of the projects became a 
reality. An electronic industry and massive smuggling of such goods cannot 
go together.
    
The Export Processing Zone remains an eternally stunted body even after it 
has been exempted from labour law and it provides one window facility for 
foreign investors. Its total foreign investment of about 170 million 
dollars is a shadow of the massive investment of over 3 billion dollars in 
the export processing zone near Dubai.
    
Nooriabad, close to Karachi, was to provide employment to the local workers 
in Dadu but because of ethnic violence and increasing crimes that made 
little headway.
    
The need of the hour is a task force for economic re-generation of Karachi. 
If the federal or the Sindh government would not set up such a body, the 
private sector in the city should do that with the approval of the 
government. When the 11 working groups set up by Mr Nawaz Sharif come up 
with their reports and the government takes final decision on them, that 
may not be enough for Karachi in view of its peculiar problems and 
accumulated liabilities. It needs a task force to identify its specific 
problems and suggest specific solutions to be implemented within a short 
time-frame.
    
The labour policy has also to be revised instead of having a good policy on 
paper which breeds a variety of nasty violations. The policy restrains good 
employers, like multinationals, while it shields the notorious group system 
which many Pakistani employers, particularly in the textile sector, rely 
on. The new policy has to let employers have the right to fire subject to 
rules. Otherwise we may not be able to get the best rewards from our 
privatisation efforts or our relentless drive for attracting foreign 
investors.
    
If Karachis economic problems are to be solved and its future secured, it 
has to become an island of peace and progress. A meeting of American and 
Asian strategic experts recently suggested that Karachi and Hong Kong 
should become tax-holiday zones. Considering that the bulk of the federal 
revenues come from Karachi, that may seem a distant dream.
    
But the fact is that if Karachi becomes an island of peace with inter-
ethnic peace and its infrastructure is improved it can become a bubbling 
industrial city and a far larger financial centre. But Karachis leaders, 
particularly those of the MQM have to strive for that relentlessly, 
brushing aside small considerations for larger objectives and have clearer 
vision of its role in the 21st century.
    
All that has to begin with imparting quality education in the city, and 
particularly technical and computer education. More than Hong Kong, 
Singapore may be the best model. Singapore has been built up by disciplined 
men under a dynamic and far-sighted leadership. We need that kind of an 
educational and infra-structure base in the city. We can ignore all that 
only at grave peril to ourselves.

<a name="hope">Hopeful hints about a new sports policy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

While Pakistan is celebrating its golden jubilee, serious gaps and 
deficiencies in the realm of sports hit the eye. The most glaring lapse on 
this vital front was the failure of successive governments, since the 
creation of the new state on August 14, 1947, to formulate a national 
sports policy.
    
After almost half a century it is evident that several young generations of 
the country were deprived of a national direction in the field of healthy 
sports activities. Huge amounts of public money were wasted, in the absence 
of any national sports policy, by a conglomerate of bureaucrats, the 
Pakistan Sports Board, the Pakistan Olympic Associations and several sports 
federations on unproductive outings  with rare exceptions  to regional 
and world moots accompanied by disproportionately large contingents of 
officials and joy-riders.
    
The outcome of this lop-sided approach has been the overall decline of 
national sports at the hands of a few incompetent but influential 
monopolists in the national sports organisations.
    
With virtually no accountability at any level the sports structure seems to 
have almost collapsed. The Federal and the provincial governments are 
vulnerable under the charter of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
because of their interference in the affairs of the sports organisations.
    
The IOC charter lays the responsibility of promoting sports on the POA and 
its affiliated national federations, but in Pakistan the POA and the 
national federations substantially depend on funds and contributions from 
the governments for even coaching camps not to say, foreign tours.
    
It is to be seen if in the wake of recent changes, significant structural 
reforms are introduced in the sports sector, as indicated by Mr Mushahid 
Hussain, Advisor to the Prime Minister on Information, Sports and Culture. 
The proposed Sports Conference on March 30 in Islamabad, avowedly called 
for taking measures to revamp and revive sports in the country, can be a 
meaningful exercise but the task is very challenging and demanding. If a 
new sports policy is formulated in another six months it will be a great 
achievement.
    
The need to curb the carter-style tendency in the national sports is 
manifest, yet getting rid of the sports Mafia will not be easy. In the past 
no government could succeed in putting the national sports on the right 
track partly because they lacked the will and partly because of the stiff 
resistance from powerful vested interests.
    
In order to strengthen the base it would be in the fitness of things that 
provincial sports conferences were organised at Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar 
and Quetta, before launching the ambitious scheme on a country-wide scale. 
Such conference can be easily held under the auspices of provincial sports 
boards of Punjab, Sindh, NWFP and Balochistan. This exercises would bring 
into focus the ground realities before the Islamabad conference is held.

<a name="some">Some flaws in the Test World Cup scheme</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

It was in the first quarter of 1995 that Matthew Engel had broached the 
idea of a world championship of Test matches in his editorial notes of the 
respected Wisden cricketers almanack to raise the games profile and to 
determine a true world champion.
    
Engel had dismissed the one-day competition and its one tournament called 
World Cup as a bewildering variety of contest with no legitimacy beyond 
the profit motive. There was no reason why this competition (of Tests) 
could not be instituted almost once, according to the Wisden editor. His 
scheme, as he developed it later, had one flaw that the duels had to go 
through a four-year cycle, even if the crowds had filled the venues to 
watch the Test stars in action and the marketing plan had proved a success. 
The officials, the players and the fans of the game cannot wait for so long 
a period for the winner to come out. The whole process would then prove 
counter-productive and may not attain the desired objective: enhancing the 
importance of the five-day inter-country duels, attracting spectators and 
sponsors and bringing in more revenue to help development of the game in 
the nine Test-playing countries as also in other areas where increased 
interest in cricket is day by day being shown.
    
Others are putting forward a two-year programme, taking the series in each 
country as the launching pad. A return Test series on away basis will be 
mandatory in this system. Many veteran cricketers and writers, including 
the editor of the Wisden, want a continuous process to prop up interest in 
Test matches and help regain their global significance.
    
A glaring defect in the plans, as are being given out by famed cricketers 
and debated in various countries, is the point system, which may not be 
fair to many nations which in recent years have attained a higher status in 
cricket like Sri Lanka, which brushed aside all challenges in last years 
World Cup to the amazement of the fans and critics alike. It will not be 
proper to relegate the world champions by giving lesser playing chances to 
them.
    
Two important personages, who have recently lined up in support of the 
global Test championship or a Test World Cup are Dr Ali Bacher, Managing 
Director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, and David Richards, 
Chief Executive of the International Cricket Council. Dr Bachers backing 
will carry considerable weight and his expected lobbying at this months 
ICC meeting at Kuala Lumpur will win many delegates to his side. He has not 
detailed his proposal but said it was the appropriate time to find the 
right formula for establishing a world championship of Test cricket which 
would counter any possible negative influences of a more frequent World Cup 
(one-dayers). It seems Dr Bacher has an open mind on the point system, 
format and the schedule of the Test World Cup.
    
David Richards seems to be in a hurry. While on a visit to Johannesburg he 
said the competition could be instituted in a year but wants a 
formalisation of the proposal from the nine Test-playing countries. 
Richards said once we have agreed in principle its just a question of 
juggling the itineraries. However, he has concurred with Engel on the 
point formula and the four-year schedule as mentioned by him.
    
The first proposal in respect of a Test World Cup was offered for 
consideration of the cricketing nations by Pakistans former BCCP supremo, 
Air Marshal Nur Khan, in an interview. The idea was taken up by Arif Ali 
Abbasi, former PCB head but at that time having the charge of Chief 
Executive of the board. He did his paper work and dispatched the whole 
design to Lords for debate and discussion at the annual caucus of global 
cricket delegates. But before he had a chance to press the issue through 
arguments and lobbying he was replaced by a technocrat, a former Test 
player, Majid Khan. The latter had a feeling that the staging of such a 
mega-championship had multi-sided problems of its own, especially relating 
to logistics and infrastructure. The proposal, as such, was talked out. The 
Englishmen could not have lagged behind and wanted it to be started without 
waste of time. Of course the commitments of what they call mini-cricket 
nations come in the way. Otherwise, the Test duels going on be included in 
their scheme of things and the points scoring may start this year (as 
Richards wants).
    
Abbasiss programme was based, more or less, on the one-day World Cup model 
where 37 or 39 matches are arranged at various venues in a maximum of two 
countries who are joint sponsors. In a championship of Tests eight matches 
are to be played pool-wise, plus a five-day final. Taking the travelling 
the whole duration may not extend beyond 60 days, which is not impractical. 
The competition can be allotted to a single country. Pakistan, as Arif 
Abbasi during his PCB tenure claimed, could have staged the whole show with 
satisfactory results and Pakistan would have proved that even Test matches 
can attract full houses both at Karachi and Lahore, the main cricket 
centres. Perhaps Pakistan can again join up with India in setting an 
example for successfully holding a Test World Cup and helping in the 
survival of the five-day Test cricket. The only problem will be the already 
committed Test tours, which means if the Pakistan plan is seriously taken 
up at the ICC meeting it can only be launched a few years after the next 
century dawns.
    
It is to be seen if the Pakistani plan is pressed by the PCB 
representatives when the issue comes up for discussion at the Lords summit 
meeting, if not at its special Kuala Lumpur session.

<a name="aami">Aamir Sohail suspended for 30 days</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, March 16: Aamir Sohails prospects for getting selected in the 
Pakistan team for the Sharjah and Sri Lanka tours went down the drain when 
he was suspended for 30 days by the Disciplinary Committee of the Pakistan 
Cricket Board (PCB) for allegedly misbehaving with its Chief Executive, 
Majid Khan.
    
The 30-day suspension is enforced with immediate effect and it will 
terminate on April 15a day after the Pakistan cricket team would have 
arrived in Sri Lanka for a two-Test series.
    
The member said Aamir Sohail had a right to appeal. He can appeal against 
the suspension any time.
    
Ashraf Qureshi, member, Disciplinary Committee and PCB Executive Council, 
said: The suspension decision doesnt have to go to the Executive Council 
for approval because when the Disciplinary Committee was constituted, it 
was empowered to take any decision it deemed necessary.
    
Aamir Sohail has been at the centre of controversy on a number of occasions 
but this has been the harshest decision he has ever faced. In 1993-94, 
Aamir Sohail was fined Rs 10,000 after he levelled ball tampering 
allegations against Pakistan Railways team during the Patrons Trophy Grade 
Two final at the LCCA ground, Lahore. That fine turned into a two-week 
suspension as Sohail didnt submit the cash purse. However, the suspension 
short-lived as he was called to reinforce the Pakistan team that was 
touring South Africa for the three-nation tournament that also involved 
eventual winners, the West Indies, and South Africa.
    
Aamir Sohail was also fined 25% of his tour fee by Intikhab Alam after he 
allegedly exchanged blows with team-mate Ijaz Ahmad Senior during the first 
one-day international at Harare against Zimbabwe in 1994-95. But this time 
Aamir Sohail was engaged in a verbal confrontation with PCB Chief Executive 
Majid Khan. Last Friday, Aamir Sohail told Majid to `mend his ways after 
the PCB Chief Executive told Aamir Sohails brother-in-law, uncle and 
brother to vacate the balcony opening towards the ground and reserved 
exclusively for the PCB officials and selectors.
    
Aamir Sohail, when appeared before the Disciplinary Committee on Sunday 
noon, admitted that he had told Majid `to mend his ways and also agreed to 
apologise to Majid.  But Aamirs contention was that he would apologise to 
Majid Khan as a former Pakistan captain for whom he has all regard and 
respect. But he was not willing to regret to Majid in his capacity as PCB 
Chief Executive, a Disciplinary Committee member, on condition of 
anonymity, said.
    
The sources said Aamir Sohail, whom the Disciplinary Committee heard for 
almost 90 minutes, argued that he was insulted by the Chief Executive. But 
we told him that if he (Aamir Sohail) had any complaints, he should have 
talked to him (Majid Khan) privately and not in front of several people, 
sources said.
    
The sources said Aamir Sohail also argued that he had affidavits of some 
spectators who witnessed the entire scene to which the Disciplinary 
Committee said: We also have several complaints and decisions taken 
against you. Those documents are signed by the PCB Executive Councillors. 
It is interesting to point out that Aamir Sohail had engaged a team of 
lawyers against the show cause notice that was served on him by the 
Secretary, PCB, Waqar Ahmad, on Tuesday last in which he was directed to 
appear before the Disciplinary Committee on Thursday.
    
In reply to the show cause, Shabbir Ahmad Lali, besides other things, had 
contested that the Disciplinary Committee was a brain-child of PCB 
Executive Council which was, in fact, a complainant in the case.  The 
Court of Justice will be deflected and the hearing before the said 
Committee will only be a perfunctory-ritual, he had said in his reply to 
the show cause notice.

<a name="outo">Pakistan out of final race; chances missed again</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

KARACHI, March 20: Pakistan, the reigning champions of World Cup, suffered 
the humiliation of their ouster from the title race when fighting Germany 
overturned a 0-2 deficit for an exciting 3-3 draw and skipper Jay Stacy 
performed a delightful first hit-trick of the event in Australia's 
comprehensive 5-2 victory over England in the five-nation Golden Jubilee 
Hockey League here on Wednesday at the HCP Stadium.

Pakistan, who over three months back at the Madras Champions Trophy put up 
commendable performance by entering the final to get the silver medal, 
fared disappointingly before their supporting crowd of about 15,000, the 
biggest of the tournament so far.

Missed chances again let down the team badly today and particularly when 
the seasoned Olympian and World Cup insideright Tahir Zaman squandered a 
54th minute second-half penalty stroke when Pakistan were endeavouring hard 
to erase the German lead of 3-2. If Tahir Zaman, who professionally 
executed the first penalty stroke, had succeeded a second time Pakistan 
would have evened the scores 3-3 and centreforward Kamran Ashraf's third 
equaliser would have been the winner to keep Pakistan in contention for a 
place in the final.

Tahir Zaman miss at the crucial moment proved costly for Pakistan who have 
collected only three points from three successive draws without a win. 
Australia, having lost their first two encounters, today secured three 
points by overpowering England, who finished at the bottom of the five-team 
contest with one point by holding Pakistan to a 1-1 draw on the opening 
day.

Pakistan and Australia play their fourth and last encounter on Saturday as 
tomorrow is the rest day but the outcome would be having no bearing for 
both the teams as they would clash again for the third and fourth position.

Similarly the Netherlands, the holders of the 1996 Olympic and Champions 
trophy, and Germany, the Madras bronze medalists, have already qualified 
for the final by securing seven points each from three matches. Their last 
league match is also on Saturday and the victorious side might enjoy a 
psychological advantage when they again fight out for the golden jubille 
trophy on Sunday, the day the tournament concludes.

PAKISTAN: Mansoor Ahmed (captain-goalkeeper), Danish Kaleem, Ali Raza, 
Irfan Yousuf, Mohammad khalid, Waseem Ahmed, Mohammad Ali, Tahir Zaman, 
Kamran Ashraf,Mohammad Shahbaz, Babar Abdullah, Ejaz Khokar, Tariq Imran, 
Irfan Mahmood, Rahim Khan and Khalid jr.

GERMANY: C. Schulte, K. Nils, C.Philip, Eimer M, Blunck (Captain), 
Hollensteiner, Michel,Domke, Saliger, Streich, Eimer C. Bechmann, Gren, 
Michler, Kurtz and Mayerhofer. Umpires: Hoyes (England) and Prior(Spain).
