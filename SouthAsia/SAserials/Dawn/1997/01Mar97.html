<a name="dual">Dual nationality Restrictions of visa may go</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 20: Pakistanis holding dual nationality may not be required to 
obtain visas for entering the country of their origin as the federal 
government is considering certain facilities for them.
    
Sources said relaxation in the visa restrictions for people of Pakistani 
origin having dual nationality was being considered by the government of 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who had recently appealed to the overseas 
Pakistanis to deposit at least $1,000 in their accounts in Pakistan to help 
reconstruct the countrys economy.
    
The appeal is reported to have already started getting a positive response 
from the Pakistanis living abroad as, according to the State Banks 
reports, Pakistans foreign reserves have been swelling since the victory 
of Pakistan Muslim League in the general elections on Feb 3.
    
The sources said a final and formal decision regarding the relaxation in 
visa restrictions to those having dual nationality was expected shortly.
    
A senior official of the FIA immigration, who asked not to be named, 
however, told Dawn that he had been directed by his seniors to ensure 
maximum facilities for the incoming people having dual nationality.
    
He said those possessing dual nationality in the United States and other 
European countries were required to obtain a visa from the Pakistani 
embassies in their respective countries for entering the country of their 
origin. However, under the immigration rules, the such people holding 
Pakistani passport along with their foreign passports could also enter 
Pakistan without a visa, but they are given a landing permit for 72 hours 
by the immigration authorities and were bound to obtain a visa from the 
passport office if they wished to prolong their stay beyond 72 hours, the 
official said.
    
The FIA official said maximum facilities to those with dual nationality 
technically meant that they might not be required to obtain the visa for 
their stay in Pakistan. They could enter the country on their foreign 
passports, he added.

<a name="army">Army called out after clashes in Multan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

MULTAN, Feb 21: The district administration had to call out army to 
maintain law and order and avert any further untoward incident after three 
people, including an ASI, were injured in a clash between protesters and 
police near Chungi-No 9 on Friday afternoon.
    
The army is patrolling the Suraj-Miani, Khanewal Road, LMO Road, and 
Kutchery Road areas.
    
Police also resorted to baton-charge and teargas to disperse a group of 
protesters who turned violent after attending the funeral prayers for the 
four people killed in the Iranian Culture Centre firing.
    
Funeral prayers for the four were to be held at 2pm at the sports ground, 
but these were held at 4:30pm after the administrations assurance that 
three Shia leaders, Prof Mazhar Husain Gilani, Allama Bashir Ahmed Momin 
and Allama Ahmed Raza Najfi, would be released on Saturday morning.
 
Leaders of the PPP, the Milli Yekjehti Council, the Muslim League and the 
Khidmat-i-Insaniyat Party also attended the funeral.

<a name="five">Five killed in Lahore blast, firing on mosque</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Feb. 27: Five people were killed and over 15 suffered injuries in 
two terrorist incidents in the provincial metropolis.

A bomb explosion at a busy wagon-stand near railway station claimed three 
lives and injured 13 others, five of them critically, while two traders 
said to be financiers of Sipah-i- Sahaba were killed and two others injured 
in a shooting incident outside the Masjid-i-Shuhada.

Police said people were boarding a wagon at the railway station stand at 
about 8.50 pm when a powerful explosion ripped through the vehicle. The 
roof and doors of the vehicle were blown away and people sitting inside 
sustained serious injuries. Flying glass splinters also injured a number of 
people standing nearby. A few vehicles parked alongside the wagon were also 
damaged.

Rescue operation started about 15 minutes after the incident. Eleven people 
were brought to Mayo Hospital where three succumbed to their injuries. Some 
people were under treatment at the Railway Cairn Hospital. Police cordoned 
off the area soon after the incident and senior civil and police officials 
visited the spot to gather first- hand information.

A bomb-disposal-squad official said an explosive device weighing about 1.5 
kg was placed beneath the wagon, and it was premature to say whether it was 
a remote control device. The van owner, Allah Ditta -said he saw no 
suspicious person boarding or alighting. He said they had reached the 
wagon-stand about 15 minutes before the incident and swept the floor of the 
van. Nothing was present inside it. The bomb, he said, was placed beneath 
the vehicle afterwards.

The identity of the people killed in the incident was not established and 
the bodies remained at the hospital. Two of the deceased were teenagers 
while the third was about 25-years-old.

<a name="asif">Asif caught on tape admitting drug trade : UK paper</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Feb. 24: Authorities here were tight-lipped about the reported 
disclosures by Londons Sunday Times that Asif Ali Zardari had been caught 
on tape admitting his alleged drug connections and crimes.
 
The State Department, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the CIA were 
separately approached by Dawn for their comments but each of them declined 
to say anything at this stage.
    
We are not even in a situation where we can speculate about it, a State 
Department official said when inquired whether in such cases it was 
possible that the United States might ask for drug offenders to be brought 
to the US for trial.
    
Declining to offer any further comments, the official said: We are looking 
into these reports.
    
A CIA public affairs spokesman said he would not comment on the report 
either.
    
The news, however, struck the Pakistani community and even these US 
departments like a bomb shell. Scores of Pakistanis telephoned Dawn to know 
whether it was correct and what had been the US reaction to the 
disclosures.
    
The Sunday Times had revealed that an undercover agent, posing as a drug 
dealer, had taped a five-hour discussion with Mr Zardari, in which he 
revealed how he had been shipping heroin to the UK on a regular basis. Most 
of the Pakistanis asked the names of the senior PAF officer and the 
businessman who were allegedly present when the agent recorded the 
conversation with Mr Zardari.
    
The Pakistan government should now get to the bottom of the case and 
extract the truth from Mr Zardari as well as the PAF officer and the 
businessman, a Pakistani American businessman said.
    
Observers said the timing of the disclosures was very relevant to the 
situation in Pakistan where the caretaker government had failed to prove 
any charge of corruption against Mr Zardari and had arrested him in 
connection with Murtaza Bhuttos murder.
    
They said the authorities could now officially seek the contents of the 
tapes and institute charges of drug trafficking against Mr Zardari and his 
friends who were allegedly involved.

<a name="pppt">PPP to sue Sunday Times</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 24: The Pakistan Peoples Party has decided to take legal 
recourse against the Sunday Times for carrying, what they called, a 
concocted and baseless story regarding the involvement of Mr Asif Ali 
Zardari in drug smuggling.
    
The party is setting up a panel of lawyers to file legal damage suit 
against the Sunday Times of London. The party high command is also writing 
a letter to the CIA to make public the evidences, including the audio 
cassettes proving Mr Zardaris involvement in drug smuggling.
    
The PPP chairperson is being made a target of senseless media propaganda 
because she is perceived to be the main obstacle in the on-going conspiracy 
against Pakistan, said a PPP spokesman.

<a name="begs">Beg says he is not answerable to court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 24: Former army chief Gen Aslam Beg told the Supreme Court 
that he was not answerable to it regarding his actions as the chief of army 
staff and the sitting COAS is the only competent and proper person to look 
into the allegations or take action.
    
He made this statement after the issuance of notice by the Supreme Court on 
the petition of Air Marshal (retd) Asghar Khan. 
   
The former air chief had filed a petition against the former COAS alleging 
that he had drawn Rs150 million from the Mehran Bank and had distributed 
the amount to different politicians before the 1990 elections.
    
When the hearing started on Monday, Deputy Attorney-General Mumtaz Ahmed 
Mirza placed a certificate from the secretary ministry of defence stating 
that the ISI had not received any money.
    
The counsel for Gen Beg, Mohammad Akram Shaikh, demanded that Gen (retd) 
Asad Durrani and General (retd) Naseerullah Babar should be summoned to the 
court for recording their statements.
    
The three-member bench of the Supreme Court consisting of Justice 
Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, Justice Fazal Ellahi Khan and Justice Bashir 
Jehangiri, adjourned the hearing of the case till March 26.

<a name="hrcp">HRCP disputes turnout figures in elections</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Feb. 26: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has 
reiterated that its teams observation of the turnout during the Feb. 3 
elections do not somehow tally with the official figures.

In a Press statement issued on Tuesday, HRCP chairperson Asma Jahangir 
clarified that the HRCPs assessment of the elections so far remains the 
same as it gave out on Feb. 4.

She said: It appears that there is another human rights body that has, 
confusingly, adopted the same initials  HRCP  as that of the Human Rights 
Commission of Pakistan. It has just published its comments on the polls. 
These have unfortunately widely been mistaken as ours. I wish to clarify 
that HRCPs assessment of the elections so far remains the same as it gave 
out in its Press release the following day.

Our teams which toured 100 of the National Assembly constituencies and 
close to 200 of the provincial assemblies constituencies did report that to 
the extent of their initial observations the polling was orderly and 
according to the rules. But to confine an assessment of polling to the 
motions of the casting of ballots is to under-define the concept of 
fairness and freeness. We had pointed out that a number of other factors, 
such as the conduct of the caretakers, the official pronouncements during 
the run-up to the election, and the cases in the high courts and Supreme 
Court, had also apparently greatly affected the process, the HRCP 
chairperson concluded.

<a name="siac">Siachen, trade should be basis of bilateral talks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Feb. 27: The United States on Wednesday revealed the outlines 
of what could be the beginning of a major negotiating process between 
Pakistan and India in which Kashmir may not be on top of the agenda but 
Siachen and trade issues are to be given top priority.

"It is up to the two countries to decide how they fit Kashmir into that 
equation. It may be that India and Pakistan can get together and come up 
with some kind of negotiating process whereby the political status of 
Kashmir is not first on the agenda but rather Siachen is first and trade is 
second," Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel told an important 
seminar on Pakistan's future, its domestic, foreign and economic policies.

The discussion was organised jointly by the US Institute of Peace and the 
Middle East Institute in Washington. The panellists held a 90-minute 
discussion on Pakistan's major political, economic and foreign policy 
problems and some very interesting observations and comments were made 
which could indicate how the US policy would now move vis-`-vis the new 
government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in particular and Pakistan in 
general.

On the economic problems facing Pakistan, Ms Raphel said Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif was aware how little manoeuvring room there was for his 
government and she was glad that Mr Sharif had decided to abide by the 
agreements with the IMF, disregarding advice to the contrary. "The basic 
problem is that Pakistan spends too much and does not collect enough 
revenue. The result of this is that it would be difficult for them to meet 
the targets set by the IMF arrangements. We are pleased to hear that Nawaz 
Sharif has decided to stick to the IMF arrangement and will try and 
increase revenues by privatisation, retiring debts and asking expatriate 
Pakistanis to put money into Pakistan," Ms Raphel said. She was very clear 
that rejection of IMF agreements would have been disastrous for Pakistan. 
"I don't think that would have worked and they would have run severe risk 
if they walked away from that IMF programme," she said.

Suggesting measures that should be undertaken by the new government, the US 
Assistant Secretary of State said: "Starting down the road to solving 
Pakistan's economic problems is difficult because it needs austerity and 
nobody is terribly keen on that. "The intentions of Nawaz Sharif are good 
but he will have to work hard to sell the idea of austerity, to pay now and 
get later. It is a hard concept to sell," she added.

<a name="fore">Foreign exchange reserves cross  $1 billion mark</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nasir Malick

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 27: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's debt retirement scheme is 
receiving enthusiastic response from the people and the foreign exchange 
reserves have crossed $1.0 billion, government officials said. Everyone is 
contributing in whatever manner he can," an official said.

On Thursday, the prime minister received donations and fixed deposits worth 
more than Rs2 billion during the businessmen convention, which was presided 
over by him.

The government is mostly banking on Pakistani expatriates to send money by 
donating or depositing $1,000 each in one of the three schemes launched by 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar said in an 
interview that foreign exchange reserves stood at $1.065 billion as against 
$780 million which the government had inherited from the caretakers. He 
said in the first seven days after Nawaz Sharif took oath of his office, 
foreign exchange reserves increased by $100 million while in the last three 
days another $185 million were added to them.

Commerce Minister Ishaq Dar said the government was expecting to collect at 
least $1.0 billion from local and expatriate Pakistanis for debt retirement 
fund. He said the government would endeavour to increase the foreign 
exchange reserves to $2 billion.

Pakistan has to pay more than $1.25 billion in debt retirement this year. A 
government official said the proceeds from the privatisation of state-run 
industries would also be used for paying off the national debt. He said the 
previous government had not used the entire privatisation proceeds for debt 
retirement. "The PPP government paid off $1.0 billion in debt servicing 
though it could have paid more." He said the privatisation process was 
being geared up so that the debt could be paid off as early as possible.

<a name="trad">Traders fear misuse of green channel</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Aamir Shafaat Khan

KARACHI, Feb. 26: The prices of some electronic items have come down in the 
local market in anticipation of their influx through the green channel, 
which the government had restored two days back.
    
Dealers at the Regal Chowk contemplate further decline in prices within the 
next 20 days if the green channel, like previous experience, turns into a 
Khepia channel.
    
They said the government this time had taken stern measures at the airports 
to check illegal imports but former Chairman, Pakistan Electrical and 
Electronic Manufacturers Association (PEEMA), A.H.A. Ahmed told Dawn the 
goods had started arriving into the markets.
    
The misuse of green channel can only be curbed when the Customs department 
becomes strict, otherwise the unscrupulous persons will take the channel by 
storm, he added.
    
It may be noted here that the prices of electronic items move both ways in 
the markets, depending on the activities of Khepias as well as on import 
duties.
    
Mr Ahmed was of the view that the menace of smuggling through Afghan 
Transit Trade (ATT) and other channels could only be tackled if the 
government reduces the import duties.
    
Former President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Haji Shafiqur 
Rehman in a letter to Nawaz Sharif urged him to issue orders for punishment 
of officials who may be found to allow the misuse of the green channel.
    
He also urged the prime minister to fix 35 percent customs duty on the 
import of tea, crockery items, electronics, perfumes, small auto spare 
parts and spices as these items were considered preferable items for 
Khepias.

6.30% on four-year, 5.70% on three-year and 5.10% on two-year.
    
The SBP circular made it clear that in case of two-year deposits there 
would no encashment before maturity but has made provisions for premature 
encashment of deposits of three-year and more.
    
Any depositor who wishes to receive the profit of his deposit in rupee has 
been advised to indicate it in writing to the concerned bank which will 
arrange for transfer of the rupee amount to a person designated by him.
    
The deposit will be kept in the name of the depositor. At the time of 
placement of funds, or afterwards, another person can be designated to 
receive the amount in case of mishap. The circular states that all the 
authorised dealers have agreed to handle all remittances under this 
programme free of charge and commission.
    
The circular has also mentioned procedure for the banks to record the name 
and address of the person who is remitting the money specifying the purpose 
and also the name and address of the person who would be claimant in case 
of mishap.
    
Under this programme any person who remits and deposits one hundred 
thousand dollars (or equivalent amount of other currencies) would be issued 
a letter of appreciation signed by the prime minister in addition to 
deposit receipt.
    
Similarly, a person who deposits one million dollar or equal amount in 
other currencies would be invited to receive the letter personally from the 
prime minister.
    
The circular also spells out the procedure for maintaining the record of 
the deposits, donations and Qarz-i-Hasna in the banks and its subsequent 
information to the foreign exchange department of the State Bank on daily 
basis.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz to honour caretakers commitments</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

THE NEWLY ELECTED Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, has assured the President 
that his government will abide by the commitments made by the caretakers 
with the IMF to combat the critical economic situation of the country.
    
The Prime Minister held a long meeting with the President along with his 
economic and financial experts and said that he would continue the major 
economic policies of the caretakers and that he would abide by the 
commitments made with the IMF, disclosed the caretaker minister for 
commerce, Dr Zubair Ahmad Khan.
    
He told Dawn that since the economic situation was still critical despite 
the many efforts made by the interim government, the new government would 
pursue the caretakers policies.
    
The President had done a very good job by providing an opportunity to both 
the caretakers and the prime minister as well his economic team here on 
February 16 to discuss important economic policies and their continuation 
and I can tell you that the new government is equally disturbed about the 
state of the economy and has assured to implement economic reform programme 
agreed with the IMF, he stated. I can not say authoritatively that the 
new government would re-negotiate any agreement with the IMF because they 
are independent to take any decision, he added saying that the caretakers 
could not force anyone to continue their policies.
    
However, he expressed his optimism that Mr Nawaz Sharif seemed serious 
about rehabilitating the economy and would continue the polices of the 
interim government. When we met in the Presidency, Shahid Javed Burki gave 
the briefing during which I and Dr Hafiz Pasha were also present and Mr 
Sharif was assisted by Mr Sartaj Aziz and Ishaq Dar and I found a 
realisation in them to improve things in the light of our policies as well 
as that of the IMF.
    
The caretaker commerce minister who would have relinquished the charge of 
the ministry by the time this piece appears, said the caretakers were 
leaving with the hope that the new government would strengthen the policies 
given during the last three months to improve the economic situation.
    
He said the President had told the meeting that he would also be readily 
available to advise the new government on economic issues. You know the 
President himself is an expert on economic and financial matters and has 
been giving advice to the previous government but their bad luck that they 
did not listen to him with the result that they are not only out of power 
but also being looked down upon by the people of Pakistan, he said adding 
that the verdict of the people in the February 3 elections should be an eye 
opener for the PPP if it really wants to remain in the political arena.
    
One of the major conditionaliites of the IMF was that Pakistan would have 
to achieve 4 per cent GDP growth rate during 1996-97 and it had refused to 
compromise on it. Experts believed that it would be an uphill task for the 
Nawaz administration to achieve that formidable target without which things 
would become very difficult for him.
    
We have no plans to re-negotiate anything with the IMF and we would 
sincerely be trying to achieve 4 per cent GDP growth rate, said PML 
Secretary-General Senator Sartaj Aziz, likely to be given the portfolio of 
the finance ministry.
    
He told this correspondent that his government has set out its priorities 
which primarily include the removal of distortions in the economy made by 
the previous government. We are very conscious that we have a very hard 
task ahead but we will try to correct things without being sluggish and 
lenient, hoping that his government would be able to deliver something 
that would help pull the country out of what he termed  an economic mess 
created by the Benazir government.
    
The IMF feels very strongly about the 4 per cent GDP growth rate, reducing 
inflation to single digit, restricting borrowing to a Rs 22 billion limit 
and making the central bank more independent specially to effectively run 
the commercial banks and the Development Financial Institutions (DFIs).
    
Independent experts, though appreciating the concern of the new government 
about the economy, were not sure whether Mr Nawaz Sharif would be able to 
drastically cut the non-development budget and other unnecessary 
expenditures. They said that past practice showed that every successive 
government in Pakistan eventually succumbed to the pressure of its 
legislators for offering them undue benefits.
    
Insiders said that Shahid Javed Burki had warned the new prime minister and 
his team on February 16 that in case the agreement with the IMF was flouted 
then the situation would become horrifying to the extent that no 
international lending agency or foreign private bank would come to our 
rescue.
    
He reportedly told them that downgrading of the credit worthiness of 
Pakistan by Moodyss of New York had done great damage and that this must 
be avoided in future.
   
In this regard, he claimed that he had persuaded another credit rating 
agency- Standard and Poors- not to go for any downgrading of Pakistan.
    
Sources said that the President had also made it clear to the new 
government without mincing words that there would be no free of all and 
that he would be there to monitor the economic situation. He also explained 
to them the role of the Council for Defence and National Security whose 
main purpose he pointed out would be to ensure political stability and 
economic policies continuation in Pakistan.
    
We are handing over power to the PML government with the hope that they 
deliver, Dr Zubair said, hoping that the economic experts of the new 
government would move forward for achieving economic betterment of 
Pakistan.

<a name="vict">Victory carries a load of responsibility</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Iqbal Patel

PEOPLES verdict in 1997 election carried various messages particularly 
that the people seriously take note of the activities of the rulers.
   
The lesson to the winning party is that the mismanagement of economy, the 
misuse of powers, rampant corruption and mis-use of tax payers money 
contributed to the debacle of PDF government and their defeat in the 
general elections.
    
The people gave a massive mandate to PML(N) at a time when the nation is 
celebrating its golden jubilee is a reflective of the expectations of the 
people attached with the party that created Pakistan and is entrusted by 
them to rebuild the nations economy and free it from the subservience of 
the WB and the IMF. The PML(N), therefore, has to take some bold decisions 
to put the economy on the right track.
    
The people are facing the pressure of rising prices. The average inflation 
rate for last three years was officially put at around 11.7 per cent but 
privately it was estimated at around 20 per cent. There is need to control 
and stabilise the prices of kitchen items particularly on a priority basis.
    
The PDF and caretaker governments have increased the prices of gas, 
electricity and POL frequently in order to reduce the budget deficit to 4 
per cent of GDP. The caretaker during their short tenure raised the gas 
charges twice aggregating 25 per cent. It was said to have been increased 
on the demand of IMF which is said to be insisting on bringing gas price in 
line with the cost of production. This justification would have been 
correct if the gas companies should have been running in losses. Whereas 
the annual report of one of the companies, SSGC showed a pre-tax profit in 
their latest annual report at over Rs.1 billion. Same is the case with the 
POL companies; PSO earned Rs 1175.62 mln profit in 1993-94.
    
The people are panalised by raising the energy prices for the inefficiency, 
dishonesty and pilferages of the KESC, WAPDA, and the gas companies as is 
reflective from the electric bills which other charges like FAC and 
surcharges which include constitute more than 100 per cent of energy or 
charges of the bill. 
   
These companies are facing the liquidity crunch and cannot retire their 
foreign debts. In fact, these companies should manage to collect their dues 
/ arrears from the politicians who are the utilities defaulters. It would 
help to improve their liquidity position instead of burdening the people 
with high unforformidable utility charges. Prices of power, gas, petroleum 
have a direct impact on the cost of production and transport, this burden 
is shifted by industries and others to the people by raising the prices of 
the goods and services on one hand and the export becomes incompetative on 
the other. Thus all economic activities are affected.
    
The frequent increases in POL charges are reflective of the adjustment of 
exchange rates of Pak rupees against dollar as required under the agreement 
executed with the WB and IMF. These companies should, instead, adjust these 
exchange differences against Exchange Risk Reserves to be created out of 
annual profit of the company. Thereby increase in POL prices could be 
avoided.

Manufacturing sector
    
The export during the first three years increased on an average, by 8.9 per 
cent per annum against target of 12.5% while the import rose by 7.1 per 
ceent per annum, the cumulative deficit in the trade account therefore 
surpassed the plan target. Thus the economy is plagued by huge deficit and 
trade imbalance.
    
Production has slowed down and more than 3000 industrial units have been 
closed and the industry grew by only 2.6 per cent during the last three 
years against the target of 10.5 per cent. The steps should be taken to 
start and enhance their production through initiating fiscal measures such 
as reducing the income tax rate at import stage, reducing the import tariff 
of industrial goods and by reducing the rate of general sales tax.
    
These measures will revive the industrial activities, hence the production 
will increase, export will be augmented, inflation will decrease, prices 
will decrease and the employment opportunities will be increased.

Taxation & corruption
    
Our society is mainly faced with the problems that out of a population of 
more than 130 mln only 0.80 people were paying income tax, there is massive 
evasion of tax and the tax collectors remained corrupt.
    
Thus there is a need to widen the tax net, reinforce equity by widening the 
base of direct taxation bringing farm income into tax net which was 
estimated to fetch Rs 20.0 billion. 
   
All the unnecessary exemptions should be eliminated, discrimination among 
tax payers should be abolished and the salary income of public 
representatives and of the government employees should be made taxable at 
par with tax payers of the corporate sector.
    
The number of tax payers should be enhanced by encouraging new comers by 
introducing a long-term at least for three years liberal self-assessment 
scheme and other simplified procedures and systems.
    
Transparency International has labelled Pakistan the most corrupt nation in 
Asia. The corruption is the leakage where form the tax revenue is flowed 
out. The tax evasion and corruption in the tax officials are due to vast 
discretionary powers vested with them under the income tax law. Therefore 
these discretionary pow3rs of the tax officials should be minimised and be 
made subject to check and balances which will help to minimise the tax 
evasion and corruption. it is estimated that the prevailing scale of tax 
evasion is to the tune of Rs 120 billion annually and scale of corruption 
once about a decade ago was estimated by then Finance Minister to cost 
exchequer at Rs 2.0 billion.
    
More revenue can be collected through a crusade against corruption rather 
than imposing high rate of taxation. High tax rate elude the government 
efforts to raise the revenue / GDP ratio. The maximum tax rates in most 
countries of Far East are below 35 per cent as against the average of 65 
peer cent in Pakistan. This situation suggests to reduce tax rate which 
will yield high saving rate and tax revenue too.
    
Therefore restructuring the tax system which plugged off these leakages is 
a need of the time which will increase the number of tax payers and will 
enhance tax revenue collection as per target plan of the government.
    
A considerable money of Rs 135 billion is stucked up with the defaulters of 
bank loans. A recovery process thereof should be started. The government 
should require the individual banks to negotiate the matter with their 
clients and to work out a compromised arrangement with them rescheduling 
their outstanding loans and get the compromise sanctioned from the court as 
provided under Section 284 of the Companies Ordinance 1984.
    
This way the defaulters will find it easy to repay their outstanding loans. 
The banks thus will receive money. it will reduce the cost of credit which 
hitherto have increased to over 20 per cent. Recovery of bank loans, will 
increase the capacity of banks to give funds for the growth of industry 
which will help in reviving economic activities.
    
Further, the government should look into the huge bank loans amounting to 
Rs 9.78 billion which were not written off by the influential during 1986-
96 period.
    
The government should speed up privatisation through the process of stock 
exchanges. It should also disinvest the shares held by it in the banks and 
DFIs like MCB, ABL, PICIC, BEL and HBCCI.
    
These measures will broaden the base of stock exchange and will bring 
stability. The money so generated through privatisation of units and 
disinvestment of share of banks should be utilised in the retirement of 
foreign debts: so as to reduce the debts service charges. This will also 
infuse confidence of the donors.
    
The economy is plagued by huge foreign debts of some $30 billion which made 
our nation a subservieent to WB and IMF who dictates us their terms and 
interfere in governance of our economy. It, therefore, should be urgent 
priority to retire these debts as soon as possible. 
   
Their unrealistic prescriptions do not suit to our requirement and instead 
it makes it still worse. The living examples are the deficit target set by 
them at 4% of GDP, generation of revenue of Rs 41 bln through additional 
taxes in the budget of 1996-97 to meet their conditionalities which proved 
a blow to our economy, similarly imposing of GST that too at high rate also 
have adversely affected our economy.
    
The government should approach the WB and IMF to re-negotiate the deficit / 
GDP ratio higher than 4 per cent and to grant moratorium on servicing of 
foreign debts at least for three years so that resources could be made 
available to improve social services and revamp the infrastructure 
facilities needed to boost national economy.
    
A big piece of the cake is eaten up in paying of debt service charges and 
military expenditures which have damaging effect on the rest of economy. 
    
Hence efforts should be made to retire the debts speedily. Further our 
foreign policy should be reviewed to have better relations with our 
neighbours, so as the expenditures on defence could be reduced which at 
present accounts for around 6 per cent of the GDP against development 
expenditures which has fallen from 7.7 per cent to less than 5 per cent of 
GDP upto year 1995-96. 
   
The defence expenditures are exceptionally free from scrutiny or audit. The 
tax payers are deprived from their right to know the justification of such 
huge expenditures.
    
Serious efforts be made to lessen the burden on the exchequer by cutting 
down the number of miniseries, divisions and departments in both, the 
federal and provincial governments. 
   
This would improve save about Rs 35 billion. The savings can if certain 
measures are undertaken to reduce the number of employees such as 
attractive golden hand-shake and early retirement schemes by designed for 
the employees would attract large number of employees out of government 
service. 
   
Similarly a freeze should be clamped down on all promotions, increments and 
recruitments of the government employees. 
    
These measures sound a bit harsh but will help economy and the country.
    
Last but not least government should cut their lavish official expenditures 
such as on foreign medical treatment, foreign trips, haj, mra with large 
entourages, form jumbo cabinets etc.
    
The measures suggested above would reduce the budgetary crises and place at 
the disposal of the government substantial resources which could be 
utilised to revive industrial activities in the country and would reduce 
budget deficit to four per cent.

<a name="shar">Sharifs uphill task to reduce prices</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

PRIME MINISTER Nawaz Sharif wants not only to hold down the soaring prices 
in an environment of sustained high inflation but also bring down the 
prices of essential goods for the common man significantly.
    
He has identified specifically, wheat flour, sugar, and vegetable ghee, the 
prices of which rose sharply in recent weeks following maldistribution, 
storage and administrative hiccups and dishonest business practices.
    
He began working on such a drive even before he was sworn in. His younger 
brother, Shahbaz Sharif, had a meeting with businessmen immediately after 
the election and pleaded with them to help bring down prices of essential 
goods. You voted us into power, and now help us bring down the prices, he 
said.
    
While various figures of price reduction sought or desired have been 
mentioned, the minimum is a reduction of one rupee for wheat flour, two 
rupees for sugar and three rupees for vegetable oil per kilo. Vigorous 
efforts are already underway to bring atta prices down by one rupee per 
kilo with which the flour millers are ready to cooperate more or less or 
with demands of their own to make the concession real.
    
What is significant is that a substantial part of these items are imported 
and the import continues with 2.4 million tonnes of wheat imports alone due 
this year. Sugar import also continues as its production this year is not 
expected to exceed 2.6 million tonnes which will be better than last years 
2.47 million tonnes but far less than the 1995-96 output of 3 million 
tonnes.
    
The demand of sugar growers for exorbitant prices up to Rs 50 per 40 
kilogramme instead of less than a half of that fixed by the government is 
bedevilling sugar production and delaying full sugar output.
    
Overall food prices in the world are now 1.5 per cent less than last year 
in dollars and less than 8 per cent in sterling, but 7 per cent more than 
last month in dollars and 8.8 per cent more than last month in sterling. So 
the world price situation is better than last years particularly when the 
imports are done in sterling.
    
In his earnestness to fulfil his electoral commitment, Mr Sharif may want 
to subsidise these items as their prices have risen sharply in recent 
months in Pakistan due to the 17 per cent devaluation of the rupee carried 
out last year and the higher cost of production, transportation, 
distribution and sale.
    
But that is taboo as far as the IMF and the World Bank are concerned. And 
restrictions in that area are so rigid that even the Utility Stores were 
restrained from selling their essential items which are usually formally 
identified and listed by the government, that was a major departure from 
the pattern followed at concessional rates in previous Ramazan. So the 
future of Utility Stores is in serious doubt.
    
Not only does the IMF, which wants to bring down the budget deficit to 4 
per cent this year and to 3 per cent next year, it wants all subsidies to 
go as also does the World Bank, whose senior vice- president is Mr Shahid 
Javed Burki, and who holds all subsidies as a dirty word in public finance.
    
When World Bank President J.D. Wolfensohn was in India recently, he was 
questioned by the Press, very critically, about his opposition to food 
subsidies. He said he was opposed to subsidies in the US and in Europe and 
so he would be opposed to subsidies in India too as they would make the 
Indian economy eventually non-competitive. When he opposed food subsidies 
he was also arguing for better returns to the farmers.
    
But subsidies overall form a minuscule part of public expenditure. Food 
subsidies this year are to be only Rs 6 billion compared to Rs 7.55 billion 
last year.
    
The World Bank has mounted a campaign in Pakistan to do away with the 
subsidies on imported wheat which enables the government to sell it in 
Pakistan at prices at which local wheat is sold.
    
It sponsored a seminar of agricultural experts through the Agricultural 
Prices Commission earlier to evolve a consensus on that. Major farmlords 
and some top bureaucrats with large farms of their own supported the move 
and argued they should be paid world prices for their wheat, in fact 
inclusive of the landed cost of imported wheat which covers shipping and 
insurance charges.
    
Currently Pakistanis are forced to pay higher prices for all imported items 
because of the heavy devaluation of the rupee and also high prices for 
vegetables in this winter when normally vegetable prices crash, 
particularly winter vegetables. Some of the vegetables and fruits are 
exported but the export earnings are very small compared with the stiff 
prices Pakistanis have been paying for vegetables.
    
Fish prices have skyrocketed and better quality fish is scarce and too 
expensive. Here again we are told of fish exports but again the import 
earnings are very small. The dichotomy in both the areas persist.
    
If the government cannot subsidise food prices and even the Utility Stores 
cannot be helpful in this area, and prices in Friday and Tuesday Bazaars 
too have been high, how does Mr Nawaz Sharif fulfil his commitment to the 
masses to reduce prices of essential items?
    
As they rejoice over his return to office he can ask the traders to reduce 
their profits and lower prices. He has to ask the wholesalers, middlemen, 
distributors and retailers to reduce their prices as their profit margin is 
very large.
    
The difference between the prices at the Sabzi Mandi and at the retailers 
end can be as much as 200 per cent. Pakistani businessmen have the highest 
profit margin in South Asia, Indian businessmen on the other hand rely on 
larger turn-over for their profits.
    
He could persuade the transporters also to reduce their profits. After all 
he has helped them with thousands of trucks, buses, Suzukis, taxis and 
other form of transport at vastly reduced prices, and he can exhort them to 
respond to his call so that he can help them more later.
    
Of course, they will argue that both the Benazir government and the 
caretakers have together increased petrol prices within six months by 18 
per cent, kerosene prices by 34 per cent, high speed oil by 34 and light 
diesel 42 per cent respectively and furnace oil by 46 per cent.
    
The caretaker government came up on February 4 with some token reductions 
as world prices of oil have fallen by 10 per cent but the price of petrol 
was not reduced at all. If Mr Sharif wants the cooperation of businessmen 
and transporters in reducing prices, he needs to bring down POL prices in 
line with the falling world prices by spring.
    
The government should also realise that when the prices of any items rises, 
hoarding starts in anticipation of still higher prices, which comes to 
pass. 
   
In the process, adulteration and use of short weights and measures by 
traders, particularly the retailers, become common.
    
Mr Sartaj Aziz says the Benazir government focused on demand management or 
demand reduction by raising taxes and duties and increasing interest rates 
but the new government will give more attention to the supply side.
    
On the physical side of demand reduction Mr Sharif wants small wedding 
parties and less social ostentation. He deplores the practice of not only 
politicians but also officers with apparent small incomes giving wedding 
dinners for thousands of guests. Success in curtailing such ostentation 
depends on the extent to which public figures will stay away from such 
functions and enquire into the sources of income of the officers indulging 
in such excesses.
    
Prices can come down instead of the Sensitive Price Index hitting 15 per 
cent and consumer price index 13 per cent officially, and far more 
actually, if agricultural production goes up along with industrial output.
    
China which had a 26 per cent inflation two years ago has a 6.6 per cent 
inflation rate today because of sustained economic growth which is 9.9 per 
cent now and will be 10.5 per cent in 1997.
    
Agricultural output went up in 1996 by 5.1 per cent and industrial 
production by 20.4 per cent. Food grains last year registered a record 
output of 480 million tonnes and meat and fisheries output went up by 10 
per cent. And the Chinese yuan has come up from 8.48 to a dollar two years 
ago to 8.29 now, the same as in February last year, making imports, cheaper 
unlike us who have to pay 30 per cent more.

Indian example
    
The same has happened in India where inflation has come down from 12.2 per 
cent last year to 8.5 per cent now because of the bumper harvests its 
exportable sugar and cotton, industrial growth of 9.9 per cent and 
reduction in the interest rate on short term lending from 12.97 per cent to 
7.5 per cent now.
    
In Pakistan, prices have been rising as a result of a large mix of official 
policies and irrational official steps. They include constant increase in 
agricultural support prices, rise in taxes and increase in their variety, 
rise in cost of production due to increase in power, gas and water rates, 
soaring cost of transportation, high interest rates, frequent devaluation 
of the rupee which pushed up the cost of imports and the high cost of 
pervasive corruption and frequent strikes and shut-downs.
    
Mr Nawaz Sharif has to address all these problems almost simultaneously if 
prices have to come down not on a tactical basis or for a short time but on 
a lasting basis and stay that way.
    
All that has to begin with large cuts in official expenditure and an 
insistent drive against corruption, particularly in the taxation services 
which is too deeply infected.
    
If revenues increase and expenditure goes down, the government need not 
foul up the consumer economy with various taxation, administrative and 
monetary measures which have bogged down the economy and reduced large 
scale industrial growth to a mere 2.6 per cent over the last three years, 
which is the source of many of our fiscal and monetary problems and 
consumer tears.

<a name="paki">Pakistans post-election economic prospects</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Mahnaz Fatima

THE EMERGING economic and political scenario thus far only serves to 
confirm the various predictions made through these columns by this writer 
during the caretaker interlude.
    
The question raised earlier by many as to how the caretakers planned to 
provide continuity to their economic policies in the event of scheduled 
elections, was answered quickly as soon as the CDNS was formed. Further, 
several other developments served to confirm the Presidents and the 
caretakers resolve to provide continuity.
    
One such notable move was the National Finance Commission (NFC) award which 
needs to be dwelt upon as it also serves to illustrate another type of 
continuity that might also be provided to the authoritarian and apathetic 
style of economic governance we have been experiencing since the Burki-
Pasha team took over in November 1996.
    
The caretakers moved with great haste to finalise the NFC award before the 
induction of elected representatives when, according to the informed, the 
NFC award can only be given by elected representatives of the people, as 
per the Constitution of Pakistan.
    
It seems that, in their exuberance, the efficiency-obsessed classical 
economists even ignored the key constitutionality requirement, leave alone 
the success that they might have achieved in somehow silencing the voices 
of dissent. And, knowing the general levels of patriotism, such enthusiasm 
could emanate only from a reasonable assurance of continuity not only of 
their policies but also of themselves.
    
Even more audacious was the announcement of the NFC award on January 13, 
1997, by the Pasha-Burki team contrary to the earlier indication that the 
award would be signed by the President after conferring with the elected 
government. So, this little act of courtesy to the elected government was 
also decided against.
    
The above was done, in the aftermath of elections, amidst news reports 
regarding Mr Burkis desire and assurance that the new government would 
continue with caretakers economic policies which were nothing but a total 
submission to IMF. This was followed by PML(N) former finance minister Mr 
Sartaj Azizs quick confirmation of continuation with the IMFs package.
    
Further, there was an unprecedented lag between the holding of elections 
and formation of government ostensibly for the submission of election 
expenditure statements. An attempt was, perhaps, made by the caretakers to 
fruitfully utilise the lag to influence decision viz-a-viz key cabinet 
positions.
    
So, in addition to a quick report on the portfolios of foreign affairs and 
defence, continuity was also reportedly confirmed for Dr Hafiz Pasha, who 
held the position of caretaker Deputy-Chairman, Planning Commission. When 
in office, both Mr. Burki and Dr. Pasha also symbolise the practice of 
classical economic thought in the country. So, the intent of their 
continuity was of great symbolic significance as it first means continuity 
to the IMF package as also ardently desired by the President himself.
    
Secondly, knowing their position in office, their continuity also 
symbolises the continuity of the extreme classical world view of economics, 
generally oblivious to Third World constraints but occasionally garnished 
with marginal social sector concerns for reasons of palatability. faith 
in price-mechanism and the magic of the marketplace that could surpass 
the most coercive practices; ruthless preoccupation with efficiency; 
grossly overriding concerns for equitable distribution of income and 
resources; non-interference by the government that could approach a virtual 
abdication of government responsibility to the people; and a complete 
apathy to popular economic opinion from a Third World perspective marking a 
ruthless arrogance in style and deeds. Since Mr. Burki was asked to 
continue, the intent appears to be in the direction of the continuation of 
classical economic thought.
    
It is little wonder then that we see Mr Sartaj Azizs partially refreshing 
statements viz-e-viz the IMFs package and targets followed by almost 
nervous denials of the reported statements.
    
It should then be little surprise that the crucial NFC award was announced 
quickly before making any attempt whatsoever to accommodate the concerns of 
the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan. Behind this uncalled 
for haste is yet another manifestation of conservative thought and elite 
arrogance that the educated can think and act better than the people or the 
masses in conservative terminology. This thought, if allowed to prevail, 
will damage liberal democratic values even before they begin to spread 
meaningfully in the country.

Helpless minister?
    
As a voter, one would, therefore, like to know if Mr Sartaj Aziz is being 
inducted as the finance minister with his hands tied at the back, with a 
Presidents man poised to serve as de-facto finance minister.
    
Will the voters of this country even be allowed a chance to get a real 
glimpse of PML(N)s economic agenda in action whose central theme is 
economic self-reliance? Or, will PML(N) be facing the brunt of an economic 
die that has already been cast in the fashion of textbook classical 
economics that failed to show results even in the First World where 
governments intervened heavily in public interest until such time that 
there was little need to do so.
    
If the above is true, then the elected government will virtually be a 
captured one. As a voter, one would then like to see the real finance 
minister stand up and take charge so that he is accountable before the 
people or can get due credit if he manages to turn the economy around.
    
If the above argument is contended by our elected representatives and if 
the elected representatives choose to continue to repose faith in the 
caretaker economic policies; then too, one would be justified in urging the 
elected government to let the continuing heir of the caretaker economic 
legacy wear the coveted hat of the countrys finance minister.
    
In addition, our elected representatives confidence in the caretaker 
economic policies would make one wonder even more about the post-election 
economic prospects of Pakistan.
    
By now, the true ills of Pakistans economy are known to all and sundry. To 
recapitulate, we have an inflated defence expenditure that is taboo to even 
talk about publicly by the key decision makers or heads might roll.
    
Since even lay persons know about this huge burden, could one imagine that 
Mr Burki would underestimate its effect on the economy in his honest and 
free moments? However, Mr Burkis evasive responses, while in office, 
served to demonstrate the impotence of key decision makers as far as 
defence expenditure trimming/ reduction is concerned.
    
In fact, this is one expenditure that is justified by all office seekers, 
politicians or otherwise, or else they cannot even think of continuing. All 
future governments are expected to remain ineffective in this regard unless 
the academics who may be holding ministerial offices in Islamabad can pick 
up courage to begin to educate our Generals and the foreign office about 
it. 
   
Or, an unencumbered Mr Burki back in Washington would use his good offices 
to make it yet another IMF conditionality for Pakistan to adhere to which 
would be most welcome.
    
Second, there is a high debt-servicing burden which the conservative 
economic thought is trying to shed selling off the states profitable 
concerns.
    
If at all, this might prove to be a one-time remedy unless we quickly 
develop internal resource generation capability to not only compensate for 
lost government revenues from state enterprises but to also prevent 
incurring of debt in future when we will be left with no state assets to 
fall back on. A further assumption of the conservative economic thought is 
that private enterprise, once unleashed, will work wonders.
    
In theory, it should show good results, if not wonders, only if the First 
World behaviour patterns can be replicated in Pakistan.
    
The private business behaviour pattern in Pakistan has, however, been 
generally characterised with under-reporting incomes for tax purposes, 
defaulting on loans, risk averse business practices, and siphoning away of 
declared profits instead of reinvesting in business and industry in the 
country. 
    
The quick gains culture has unleashed business enterprise in a distorted 
manner with the result that various government incentives and 
business/industry friendly policies led to the development of businessmen 
and tycoons, in all times, and to a retarded growth of business and 
industry in the country which is indeed paradoxical.
    
One hopes that this is not the type of business enterprise symbolised by 
Nawaz Sharif that refuses to agree to give due returns to the country. If 
it does, then we might be in for yet another era wherein the business 
classes will eat into the very vitals of the countrys economy with the 
businessmen becoming richer and the business/industry becoming poorer 
making it an almost zero sum game.
    
And, this is most likely to happen should the agricultural sector continue 
to avoid their equitable income tax payment and continues to enjoy a 
preferential treatment. Unless the major sectors of the economy begin to 
give their due share equitably, we will remain caught in a vicious circle.

Virtuous cycle
    
If history does not repeat itself, and a virtuous cycle is developed, even 
then the gains might never reach the people due to an iniquitous 
distribution of assets and means of production that we are beginning yet 
another journey with, if at all it is a new beginning.
    
Without definite policy intervention to redistribute assets before growth, 
that is, land reforms and broad-based business ownership; national income 
will continue to be distributed most inequitably with social unrest, 
agitation, and anger simpering beneath the surface and justifiably so.
    
So, for our peculiar problems, classical or neo-classical economics has 
little or no solutions. On the contrary, it might only serve to strengthen 
the above coalition of major interests that would continue to grab major 
shares of the pie thus working against the interest of the people, of the 
countrys economy, and of the long term interest of the country itself. 
   
The need of the hour is to provide teeth to the economy and not just keep 
it afloat through a life-jacket of cosmetic applications to the national 
accounts that is the second-best alternative that the classical economists-
cum-public finance experts propose for the country.
    
At best, this approach can only delay the crisis and might even aggravate 
long-run survival prospects as irresponsible economic ways and/or 
iniquitous distribution of income will be allowed even more time to 
perpetuate.

<a name="link">Links to be forged with overseas stock markets</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 28: The government is planning to adopt measures which will 
attract maximum equity participation in Pakistani companies from Japanese 
investors by creating congenial atmosphere based on confidence-building 
efforts and close contacts between the stock exchanges of the two 
countries.
    
For attracting maximum equity participation from Japanese investors in 
listed companies as well as new floatations of shares from local companies, 
the government would first like to see that Pakistani stock exchanges are 
formally recognized by their Japanese counterparts.
    
The official sources said that to begin with, the Karachi Stock Exchange 
(KSE) would be asked to seek formal recognition from the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange (TSK) for which it had been advised to take the assistance of the 
Japanese Securities Dealers Association (JSDA).
    
Besides, these sources said, leading Pakistani dealers and brokerage houses 
having international affiliations would also be asked to forge links with 
major Japanese securities and seek their collaboration and assistance in 
attracting equity participations in Pakistani companies.
    
The government is also approaching local stock exchanges asking them to 
organize a number of seminars in Japan so that awareness is created about 
Pakistan in general, its economy and its stock markets. These sources said 
that newly emerging Asian Tigers like Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, even 
Singapore organized such seminars which helped to attract participation of 
potential portfolio investors from Japan and other developed countries.

<a name="ksei">KSE index loses 43 points, fresh sell-off predicted</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb. 27: Massive selling in Hub-Power and PTC vouchers pulled the 
KSE index below the psychological barrier of 1,700 points. The loss of 
about 43 points in a session at 1,699 was an enormous one. But they failed 
to pinpoint specific reasons behind the snap reaction..

Most of the investment shares, notably banks, are eroding major portion of 
gains netted after the PML victory in elections and are apparently heading 
towards their pre-reaction levels. Insurance shares followed them, although 
Adamjee Insurance despite late selling managed to hold on to its early 
gains and so did New Jubilee Insurance and some others.

Textile shares, however, evoked good interest under the lead of Burewala 
and Dawood Cotton after the announcement of good dividend and so were some 
others including Kohinoor Spinning and Nishat Mills. Synthetic shares were 
actively traded under the lead of Dewan Salman, Dhan Fibre and Ibrahim 
Fibre and so did most of sugar shares after good dividend announcements by 
leading among them. Cement shares were actively traded both ways, but 
leading among them ran into selling at the higher levels and ended lower, 
big losers among them being Chakwal, Cherat and Maple Leaf Cement.

An interim dividend of 30% from PSO and 35% from Shell Pakistan triggered 
heavy buying in both the shares but late selling allowed them to finish 
with clipped gains.

Electrical shares, which rose sharply after the news of ban on luxury 
items, came in for selling later and so did leading shares such as Engro 
Chemicals, Fauji Fertiliser, Lever Brothers and some others. Singer 
Pakistan, Reckitt and Colman, Hinopak Motors, BOC Pakistan, Ghandhara 
Nissan and Dawood Hercules among the MNCs showed good rallies on active 
short-covering.

Trading volume showed a fresh modest increase at 58.649 million shares from 
the previous 56.814 million shares, although a half of which went to the 
credit of Hub-Power and PTC vouchers. Hub-Power again topped the list of 
most actives, sharply lower by Rs 1.05 on 13.700m shares, followed by PTC 
vouchers, easy 70 paisa on 12m, ICI Pakistan, lower 55 paisa on 9.500m, 
Dewan Salman, up 50 paisa on 6.500m, and Fauji Cement, lower 35 paisa on 
3.130m shares.

Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, off 35 
paisa on 0.840m shares, followed by Dhan Fibre, easy 35 paisa 0.897m, Sui 
Northern Gas, easy 35 paisa on 0.505m, and Japan Power, lower 15 paisa on 
0.313m shares.

There were 389 actives out of which 258 shares fell, 72 rose with 59 
holding on to the last levels.

DIVIDEND: Pakistan State Oil Company (PSO), interim 30%, Cherat Paper, 30% 
interim, Sakrand Sugar, bonus shares 20%, Shahtaj Sugar, cash 15%, Attock 
Refinery, interim 120%, and Fazal Cloth, cash 10%.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE last population census was held in 1981. The next should have been held 
in 1991, but was not. The true and changed figures would have suited 
neither the party in power nor the party in opposition, as they would have 
redefined most of the countrys constituencies and reflected the shift of 
population from the rural to the urban areas. 
   
Now, no figure, no statistics can be relied upon. It can only be estimated 
that the population of this country is close to 140 million, of which 80 
per cent are kept illiterate and ignorant to suit the purposes of their 
various rulers.
    
It was on this basis that the government appealed to the electorate yet 
again on February 3. The illiterate people voted in their representives by 
ticking their chosen symbol.
    
Nawaz and his men won, leaving Benazir and her troupe far, far behind. The 
usual international observers came and made the usual satisfactory noises. 
The winners claim the elections were free and fair; the losers claim the 
polls were rigged. The people should be satisfied. These elections were as 
fair and free as any elections ever have been in our country, or will be 
for a long time to come.
    
On Monday, February 17, Nawaz was voted in by 177 members as leader of the 
house and prime minister. His opponent, PPP loyalist Aftab Shahban Mirani, 
managed 16 votes. There was one abstention, Independent Asghar Khan of 
Bhakkar (alias Halaku Khan), a former police officer of the Dirty Tricks 
Brigade, now an honourable member who, knowing well how clean each side is, 
refused to vote for either.
    
Halaku I have known since 1972, then a dreaded policeman who was sent to 
Karachi by Bhutto to question me. Bhutto was desperately trying to find 
some evidence against Altaf Gauhar who had been arrested on a trumped-up 
charge and jailed. Halaku, quite happy to call a machine gun a gun 
machine, ordered his sidekick to pick up Cowasjee Ardeshir, also bearded, 
also a Parsi. This unfortunate man, totally ignorant of what was going on, 
was taken to the police station and questioned late into the night, until 
at last Halaku realising he had the wrong man, arrested me, the machine 
gun, and released him, the gun machine.
    
Halaku has done well for himself, but not half as well as the Lahore 
Chaudhrys, sons and relatives of Chaudhry Zahur Elahi, his contemporary in 
the lucrative police service. Last year when he called on me (I was on a 
visit to Lahore), he arrived in a chauffeur-driven spanking new Mercedes 
escorted by his personal armed bodyguard. He was happy with life and said 
he had then two of his relatives deputising for him, sitting as elected 
members in the Punjab Assembly.
    
The National Assembly has so far done well for itself. It could not have 
chosen a better, a more flexible, and more accommodating man as Speaker 
than Ilahi Bakhsh Soomro, who was unanimously elected.
    
Ilahi Bakhsh and I have known each other since 1943 when we both read 
science at the Dayaram Jethmal Sind College, Karachi. Later he moved to the 
Nadirshaw Eduljee Dinshaw Engineering College to do his BE, and then went 
off to America to do his M.Sc from Columbia Polytechnic. In 1951, it was 
Illoo who helped arrange for our mutual friend Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to be 
married to his second wife Nusrat, much against the will and wishes of 
father Shahnawaz and his family. Illoo produced a Maulvi and the two were 
wedded very privately, with only Karamdad Junejo and Ilahi Bakhsh standing 
by on Zulfikars side and father Sabunchi with Nusrat.
    
Illoo joined the Sindh government engineering service in 1952. From 1966 to 
1969 he was principal of his old college, which he managed to raise to 
university status, transforming it into the NED University of Engineering 
and Technology.
    
In 1970, much to Zulfikar Bhuttos annoyance, Illoos father, Maula Bakhsh, 
won against the PPP candidate and was elected from Shikarpur. So, as soon 
as he assumed power at the end of 1971 Bhutto sacked the son. The charge: 
inefficiency and corruption. In 1973, Ilahi Bakhsh was jailed by Bhutto 
on a trumped-up charge of having murdered a man who he had never met. His 
family industries were also destroyed.
    
In 1985, he almost became prime minister of Pakistan when Zia was forming 
his government, but fate eluded him and Pagaras chosen Mohammed Khan 
Junejo was given the plum, and Illoo a ministership. When democracy dawned, 
he stood from Jacobabad and was elected to the National Assembly. In the 
last round, in 1993, he was defeated.
    
Somewhere around 1994-95, Ilahi Bakhsh emerged as a senior, mature 
politician.
    
Sitting now on the high chair, he must take care of and preserve the human 
dignity of the members who sit in his House. He should direct his gaze 
towards Member Nusrat Bhutto. Our erstwhile friend is suffering from 
Alzheimers and is not fully compos mentis. Iloo obviously cannot take up 
the matter with Nusrat, but he can persuade Member Born-to-Rule Benazir to 
stop using her mother. Taking off from a fathers grave is excusable, but 
manipulating an ailing mother is beyond the bounds of decency.
    
Nusrat has paid more than her price for being a member of that Born-to-Rule 
family. She has seen her husband hanged, her younger son die in mysterious 
circumstances from a drug overdose, and her elder son gunned down by the 
police on the road outside his own house during the regime of her daughter. 
One of her two sons-in-law is in jail on a murder charge and the other is 
out on bail on another murder charge.
    
As for the new ringmaster, Nawaz, by now he must find himself walking a 
slack rope without either a pole to balance him or anyone handy to take up 
the slack. The ordinary citizen cannot afford the luxury of being a party 
to what he is likely to do, but he could write for Nawaz the speech he 
might give at the inaugural session of our latest National Assembly:
    
My dear countrymen, my fellow travellers, my brothers, my sisters, my 
supporters, my opponents: I stand before you as your leader. My aim is to 
save this country, bankrupted by the excesses of the last three democratic 
governments  two of Benazir and one of mine. The President said that 
Benazir and her husband have robbed you, the people, of $1.5 billion, of 
which there is no proof. I must declare that my family, my friends and 
myself have been accused of robbing you, the people, of the lesser sum of 
$1 billion, of which there is also no proof.
    
However, I have vowed that my new government will not victimise anyone, 
friend or enemy, but at the same time will continue the process of 
accountability, barely started, and will spare no one, not even the 
President or my talented brother, Shahbaz. Cases in court against us and 
the Chaudhrys which have been adjourned for good reason will not be 
withdrawan.
    
The President has committed a gross indiscretion. Knowing how broke we are, 
just before Eid this month, he chose to fly in a 200-seater Boeing 707 to 
perform Umra at your expense. Had he felt that it was below his dignity to 
travel by PIA, or Saudia as I did, he could have arranged to charter a 
Tiger Moth. Vain pomp and glory we can no longer afford. I hold him 
accountable and will be asking him to make good our loss. In the interests 
of open government I will make the issue public.
    
Following Mr Jinnah, who said in his inaugural speech that his first 
priority was to maintain law and order, my government will ensure the 
safety of life and property and will take action against those responsible 
for the political extra-judicial killings. The culprits will be found and 
punished, as will the killers of Editor Salahuddin, whose heirs suspect 
that it was the MQM that had him murdered, of Lawyer Nizam Ahmed and his 
son who it is suspected were murdered by the PPP, and the killers of Mir 
Murtaza, the beloved brother of our former prime minister.
    
Congratulating me in the Assembly on February 17, Benazir seemingly said 
that the goose that lays the golden eggs is now on a life-support system, 
the eggs broken and scrambled. Let us now unscramble them. The task is 
onerous but with help I can succeed. To work is a basic human need, which 
maxim we must heed and work harder.
    
Whatever I will do on the economic front will of necessity be harsh, 
stringent and incisive. The bitter pill will have to be swallowed for many 
a long year.
    
Not wishing to emulate Churchill, I offer you nothing but sweat, toil and 
tears. Again, not wishing to emulate Garibaldi, I say to anyone who loves 
his country: Follow me.

<a name="theh">The high cost of intelligence</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

ON 5 November last year, the surprising thing was not that Benazir Bhuttos 
government was dismissed, but that the ex-prime minister was surprised by 
the Presidents action.
    
Considering that she had pumped in billions into the Intelligence Bureaus 
already-swollen budget, one would have thought she would have detailed 
assessments of Mr Legharis plans and timetable. Presumably, the IB would 
also have advised her on how to prevent her administrations premature 
demise. Indeed, she was just as stunned when she was sacked in 1990. In 
both cases, the rest of us could see what was coming without recourse to 
what passes as intelligence reports in Pakistan.
    
One of the many items on the presidential charge-sheet against the Bhutto 
government was that the IB was tapping telephones on an unprecedented 
scale. Hundreds of tapes are said to have been recovered on which the 
conversations of the mightiest in the land have been recorded for 
posterity. Masud Sharif, the agencys director, has stated in court that he 
ordered this massive bugging operation on his own initiative. Maybe so, 
although this is not a very flattering comment on Benazir Bhuttos control 
on an agency which reported directly to her.
    
Whatever the truth of the matter, the fact remains that this vast 
intelligence-gathering operation was only possible due to the increased 
resources (i.e., our tax money) made available to the IB by the previous 
government. The only reason for this expansion was to keep a closer eye on 
political opponents, and where necessary, to coerce them. Putting aside the 
morality of the whole exercise, the fact is that ultimately, the IB failed 
in its mission. When push came to shove, Masud Sharif and his army of 
spooks could not warn their boss of her impending ouster.
    
This is true in varying degrees of virtually all governments and all 
intelligence agencies. In fact, Pakistans history is littered with 
intelligence failures. And yet, successive rulers have pinned their hopes 
for survival on amoral and ambitious spymasters who have convinced their 
masters that they will ensure their political supremacy indefinitely.
   
However, when the crunch came  as it has all too often in our chequered 
history  these agencies and their chiefs proved to be frail reeds.  From 
Liaquat Ali Khans assassination to the anti-Ayub movement; and from the 
PNA pahya-jam to the proliferation of ethnic and sectarian terrorism, our 
intelligence agencies have few successes to boast of. In 1965 when the 
Indian army attacked Lahore, we were caught completely by surprise. 
  
The one major operation that was a qualified success was the ISIs handling 
of the Afghan war, but that was in partnership with the CIA, and was more 
in the nature of covert warfare than an intelligence-gathering exercise. 
Also, the ISI lost its bearings once the Soviets withdrew and ended up by 
forever backing the wrong horse in the Afghan power struggle.
    
So why do our rulers continue pumping money into the black hole of spying? 
Clearly, they seem to lack confidence in democratic institutions and their 
own popularity. Indeed, as soon as they come into power, they forget about 
their party workers and start relying on the bureaucracy. In line with this 
shift comes an increasing dependency on intelligence agencies which, for 
their part, start spinning all kinds of conspiracy theories to strengthen 
their control over paranoid rulers.
    
The Benazir government set some kind of record in lavishing resources on 
the IB which was expanded dramatically to take it down to the tehsil level. 
All kinds of sophisticated bugging equipment was ordered, but ultimately, 
none of this proved to be enough.
    
The reason why our intelligence agencies have such a dismal track record is 
the quality of manpower they deploy. A couple of years ago, the UN was 
recruiting police officers for contract appointments in Bosnia. Almost all 
the officers of the elite police service of Pakistan who tried for these 
assignments flunked the English test; and most of the ones who made it to 
Bosnia then failed the driving test and ended up doing desk jobs. And this 
is the officer class who man some of the most senior positions in IB and 
the FIA.
   
The IQ and educational level among the rank and file can easily be 
imagined. While these people are capable of following and bugging the 
governments political opponents and other such enemies of the state, 
they cannot meaningfully analyse the vast amounts of data they gather.
    
The most difficult and creative aspect of intelligence work is to sift 
through facts and conjecture and come up with accurate forecasts. This is 
an area our operatives are seriously lacking in. One reason, of course, is 
that they do not want to be the bearers of bad news. The products of a 
society of sycophants, they try and insulate their masters from the real 
world by controlling the information they have access to. They are also 
aware that if they paint too many gloomy scenarios, they may easily be 
replaced by people who will put a rosier gloss on depressing news.
    
General Durranis list of politicians who were on the ISI payroll in the 
1990 elections shocked nobody, just as General Begs confession that 140 
million rupees were funnelled from Mehran Bank to the presidents election 
cell has scarcely caused a raised eyebrow. In most other countries, heads 
would have rolled, but we are so used to the armys role in politics that 
instead of trying politicians who accept such tainted funds, we elect them 
to high office. Indeed, the whole scandal was not even an issue in the 
recent elections.
    
One reason the entire accountability exercise was such a resounding failure 
under the caretaker government was the FIAs inability to deliver. Despite 
a wealth of information about sundry scams, none of the corrupt politicians 
and bureaucrats have been charged with the serious financial irregularities 
we know them to be guilty of. The few sharks who were arrested are free on 
bail, while several small fry are languishing in jail because they couldnt 
afford to pay off their investigators. Many witnesses to financial scandals 
have not come forward to give evidence because they fear they would get 
shaken down by the FIA.
    
It is high time the entire network of civilian and military agencies was 
appraised by subjecting it to a cost-benefit analysis. By now, most 
politicians in and out of power have been subjected to the attentions of 
one or another of these organisations; they have also seen the quality of 
their output. It is time that we put some intelligence into our 
intelligence agencies and removed the flab.

CAN a news-item be both amusing and menacing? I suppose it would depend on 
the disposition of the reader, the general outlook he or she brings to 
life. Sometimes that which is meant to be sinister turns out to be comical 
and that which was meant to be comical is actually intended to be 
threatening.
    
Thus the news-item creeded by APP, and therefore bearing an official stamp 
of approval, about the presence of a multitude of big brothers in the 
Parliament House on the day when Nawaz Sharif was sworn in as prime 
minister was prominently displayed by the newspapers, the prominent display 
constituting its own displeasure. The news-items lead paragraph says it 
all: There were all there. The eyes and ears of the government. There were 
more men of the intelligence agencies in the Parliament House than there 
were MNAs as election of the Leader of the House was in process.
    
The report adds that Parliament was literally swarming with unknown people 
of sensitive agencies who stood guard at every nook and corner of the 
building. Their presence was also felt by Shahid Khakan Abbasi who brought 
it to the attention of the Speaker Ilahi Bakash Soomro.
    
My reaction to this news-item was one of weariness. Some things never 
change, particularly a mind-set. There is, probably, a standard operating 
procedure that is automatically activated given a certain set of 
circumstances. It would be interesting to know how far this standard 
operating procedure dates back and whether anyone has seen fit to change it 
or, at least, to update it. All rules and regulations and procedures must 
have flexibility in them.
    
The question that needs to be asked is what was the specific purpose or the 
reason to have these swarms of people standing guard at every nook and 
corner of Parliament? Was it surveillance? Or was it a form of 
intimidation? I have always maintained that unlike justice which should not 
only be done but seen to be done, security or intelligence-gathering must 
be done but not be seen to be done. As they say in spy novels, if an 
agents cover is blown, he ceases to have any utility. Or to give a more 
current example, if you know your phone is tapped, you are hardly likely to 
give out the sort of information for which a bug has been installed on your 
telephone.
    
There is one significant fact of intelligence-gathering and that is that it 
tends to fail when it is most needed. This is not only true of this country 
but even of countries which have the technology to tell you what Saddam 
Hussain had for breakfast on a particular morning. For all its formidable 
reputation, the CIA failed miserably in Vietnam. The Vietnamese peasant in 
black pyjamas known variously as gook or Charlie, neither being terms 
of endearment, was one step ahead of the CIA. So much so that during the 
January 1968 Tet Offensive, the American Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker had to 
flee the Embassy in his night clothes. The equally formidable Mossad was 
not able to prevent the assasination of Rabin and nor RAW, the assasination 
of both Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi.
    
And there can be no more absurd performance then that of the FBI when they 
picked up the bombing-suspect of the Atlanta Games, the luckless Mr Jewell 
whose life was turned upside down and who was arrested, interrogated and 
might even have been convicted. The FBI was shown to be clueless when it 
came to investigating the crash of TWA 800 because the FBI operated from 
the start on the assumption that it was an act of terrorism and then 
proceeded to work backwards. They would have done the same in the case of 
The Oklahoma bombing had they not been stopped dead in their tracks. 
Otherwise Islamic Fundamentalists had been nominated as the villains.
    
In any case, domestic intelligence-gathering has all but ceased to have any 
usefulness since it is mainly used to keep a vigil on ones political 
opponents. That being the case, it is a gross violation of its terms of 
reference and its charter of duties. To start with, a distinction has to be 
made between the State and the government of the day. Intelligence agencies 
are meant to keep an eye on the enemies of a country. In other words, to 
forestall subversive elements, subversive to mean those who present a clear 
danger to the security of the state, those who may be passing on 
information to a countrys perceived enemies. They have no role to play in 
the political process of the country.
   
When a political party is in the opposition, its more prominent members 
attract the attention of what are called sensitive agencies. Why should 
this be so? It is not unlawful to be in the opposition. Why then should 
they be treated as suspects? The irony is that the whole procedure is 
reversed when a government changes. But the fault does not lie with the 
intelligence agencies. It lies with the government itself.
    
A long time ago, I wrote that we should not only dismantle the machinery of 
the police state but the state of mind that goes with it. In these times 
when we have become cost-conscious, we might consider the waste of money 
involved in gathering information which has no validity and which, in the 
end, serves only to harass ones opponents.

<a name="coun">Counting the cost of Kashmir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

NAWAZ SHARIFs recently-enunciated resolve to break the deadlock with India 
over the festering Kashmir problem represents the first window of 
opportunity for improving relations with our neighbour in nearly eight 
years.
    
Indeed, no prime minister in recent times in either country has enjoyed the 
kind of mandate Nawaz Sharif does, together with the freedom of manoeuvre 
it confers. Even Indira Gandhi did not gain such a sweeping majority after 
her victory over Pakistan in 1971. So this government can begin the 
politically difficult task of setting the pace. And while the Indian prime 
minister may still be a prisoner of the past  as well as a tenuous 
parliamentary majority  his Pakistani counterpart has no such constraints.
    
Obviously, there can be no unilateral declaration of peace. The residue 
of half a century of animosity still distorts perceptions on either side, 
but if anybody can break out of the vicious cycle both India and Pakistan 
are locked in, it is Nawaz Sharif with his rock-solid majority. In 
addition, his right-of-centre, Muslim League credentials will help deflect 
the predictable accusations that he is soft on India. So just as it took 
a Republican president of the United States to make peace with China, and a 
Likud prime minister to open talks with the PLO, it will need a 
conservative prime minister in Pakistan to achieve a breakthrough with 
India. As we saw, Benazir Bhuttos efforts to forge closer ties with India 
in 1989 foundered on the rocks of Indian obduracy and incessant attacks 
from her opponents. Perceived as a liberal, she had little credibility with 
right-wing politicians and Pakistans powerful establishment. Nawaz Sharif 
does not suffer from this handicap.
    
Although the number of people advocating an all-or-nothing solution to the 
Kashmir problem is mercifully declining, they still constitute a strong and 
vocal lobby. And failing a plebiscite they are sure Pakistan will win, they 
insist on clinging to the current ruinous status quo. Their Indian 
counterparts, for their part, hang on obstinately to their mantra of 
Kashmir being an integral part of India. Neither side will budge an inch, 
and both countries slide deeper and deeper into the morass of poverty and, 
at the end of the millennium, total irrelevance.
    
Just as the 20th century was about naked military power, the next century 
seems likely to be dominated by economic clout. Already, various regional 
groupings are positioning themselves: the European Union, ASEAN and NAFTA 
are powerful economic alliances that are dominant in the world economy. By 
comparison, SAARC is a pathetic joke, largely because of the endless 
bickering between India and Pakistan.
    
Quite apart from the debilitating financial cost of maintaining a huge 
defence establishment, we must count the political cost we have incurred in 
the past as a result of various direct and indirect military interventions. 
The only justification for the bloated defence budgets on both sides is the 
unending tension over Kashmir. Although India has regional pretensions as 
well as a disputed border with China, most of its armed might is poised on 
our eastern flank. Once we can shed this millstone around our necks, we can 
finally turn our attention to the long-deferred problems of poverty, 
disease and illiteracy.
    
There has been much talk about foreign investments in the recent past; 
indeed, given the decline in bilateral and multilateral aid, this is now 
the only realistic route to development. But how many investors would like 
to put their money into an explosive subcontinent where Kashmir might 
provide the spark at any moment? With the whole world to choose from, 
businessmen are unlikely to flock to an area faced with the danger of a 
nuclear confrontation triggered by an unresolved territorial dispute.
    
Our diplomacy, too, has become one-dimensional as a result of our inability 
to sort out our quarrel with India. In foreign capitals around the world, 
our poor representatives try yet again to interest their long-suffering 
hosts to take up cudgels on our behalf. Prodded by politicians in 
Islamabad, our ambassadors and their aides scurry around, waving ancient 
Security Council resolutions on Kashmir. Whenever possible, their victims 
duck for cover; but when caught, they wear a mask of pained resignation. 
Its high time we realised that the rest of the world is slightly 
underwhelmed by the whole problem, and just wishes it would go away. If 
there is any concern in any quarter, it is only because both India and 
Pakistan are covert nuclear powers. Freed from the deadweight of Kashmir, 
our diplomats might be able to get on with their job, which is to improve 
our relations with the rest of the world.  Had we really cared as much 
about the people of Kashmir as we do about their land, we would at least be 
discussing the socalled third option instead of insisting on our hardline 
position. Indeed, initial autonomy to be followed a few years later by 
final talks on the question of sovereignty may be the only hope for a 
peaceful settlement. A variation on this theme was proposed last year by Dr 
Mahbubul Haq, and he had several hawks claw at him in print. But although I 
have often disagreed with him in the past, I find much merit in his idea.
    
While many zealots in Pakistan are more than ready to fight to the last 
Kashmiri, they have few suggestions to offer on how to end this state of 
confrontation. But Nawaz Sharif is a shrewd businessman with a sharp eye 
for the bottom line. He no doubt sees the huge commercial advantages that 
would accrue to both sides if trade was to open up: our industrialists 
would have a huge market for their products; similarly, many raw materials 
would become far cheaper with resultant advantage to consumers. Both 
economies would benefit from a reduction in military expenditure on the one 
hand, and greater trade on the other.
    
It is true that ultimately, human problems cannot be subjected to simple 
financial analysis. But by clinging to a formula that is dead and buried, 
we are ensuring that the only way we will be able to help our Kashmiri 
brethren is to observe an annual strike in their name.

<a name="ulti">Ultimate responsibility</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hafizur Rahman

A COLUMNIST of an Urdu daily has wistfully recalled how Mr Lal Bahadur 
Shastri thought it proper to resign, when he was railway minister of India, 
because there had been a serious railway accident involving a large loss of 
life.
    
Mr Shastri could have done nothing to prevent the accident, but he felt 
morally bound to lay down his office. The columnist bewailed the fact that 
the principle of ultimate responsibility in democracy was no longer 
observed  at least not in Pakistan.
    
Certainly it is cause for sorrow that politicians become glued to the chair 
if inducted into an office (of profit). The fact is that if they were ever 
given the choice, they would probably be ready to surrender a few years of 
their lives rather than give up a chair. After all the chair is the thing.
    
I remember a rather telling observation said to have been made in this 
connection by Sir Chhotu Ram, the distinguished Revenue Minister of pre-
partition Punjab, who, incidentally, did much to free the Punjab peasantry 
(most of whom were Muslims) from the economic clutches of the Hindu bania. 
He was once asked why he or his colleagues did not choose to give up office 
of minister when all the time they complained that it was a bed of thorns 
and an utter museebat.
    
A rank realist, Chaudhry Sahib is reported to have replied, Bhai, when a 
minister alights from a flag car, and the police guard stands to attention 
and salutes him, it is as good as half a bottle of whisky. It is this 
stimulant, this heady feeling, which does not let him resign.
    
Heard in the accent of Karnal and Rohtak, the area Sir Chhotu Ram came 
from, this pearl of wisdom has a flavour all its own which no English 
translation can convey. But Chaudhry Sahib spoke the truth. The exercise of 
authority, the opportunity to feel and use power, the panoply, the 
adulation of fawning sycophants and (nowadays) the material privileges  
all these are no joke.
    
How many people are able to get them even for a few minutes in a lifetime? 
It would take a truly great man to be able to see the principles through 
the haze and glare created by these trappings of office. As for railway 
accidents and the like, they will go on happening anyway. Who can stop 
them?
    
What my columnist friend does not know is that, at the time it took place, 
Mr Shastris resignations had its reverberations in Pakistan too. A few 
months later there was a railway accident of almost the same magnitude in 
this country somewhere in Sindh. The matter was debated in the Central 
Assembly, as it was then called. Some of the members referred to the ethics 
of Mr Shastris action and eulogised its democratic spirit. They even 
called for similar sacrifice on the part of the then Railway Minister.
    
The minister, Mian Jaffar Shah of Mardan, got up to reply to the debate and 
ended by saying in the most indignant tone, All this talk about resigning 
because of a railway accident. Never. I shall not resign. By the grace of 
God I am a Muslim. I shall never follow in the footsteps of a kafir!
    
Thus it was that the Islamic spirit of Mian Sahib prevented the Government 
of Pakistan from losing a very energetic and useful minister. Because, 
quite apart from his English bloomers (he once described the members of a 
visiting Turkish delegation as these honourable Turkeys, and would 
invariably say filful instead of fulfil) Mian Jafar Shah was a magical 
manipulator of elections and an invaluable asset for any political regime 
willing to go through them.
    
I think it is not without reason that those of Pakistans personalities who 
are inclined by temperament towards dictatorship decry parliamentary 
democracy as being unsuitable to our psyche. If we were to follow the 
traditions of Westminster and other alien institutions, our ministers, both 
federal and provincial, would be resigning every week because of one 
trespass or another. We might then have to import ministers from abroad.
    
The trouble with these foreign institutions is that they treat ministers, 
and even prime ministers, like ordinary human beings and then expect them 
to behave like angels. How can we, simple mortals that we are, live up to 
such superhuman expectations, when each one of us, sinners as we all claim 
to be, wants to excel others in confessing to be gunahgar?
    
Whenever someone, in excess of modesty (or hypocrisy), describes himself as 
a sinner, I am always tempted to ask him why he sins at all and what 
prevents him from giving up sin. Once you have called yourself a sinner  
and you should know yourself best because anyone else calling you that 
might be guilty of calling a spade a spade  all your efforts, your mental 
faculties, your moral strength, should be directed towards reforming 
yourself. As someone aspiring to be a good Muslim you should be doing your 
best to become deserving of a better epithet than a sinner.
    
Confessing to a crime, which is a wrong in the eyes of man-made laws, may 
be pardonable. But a sin is against the law laid down by the Almighty  
that is, if you are a believer. Instead of trying to wash that sin, people 
go on proclaiming that they are gunahgars, sinners. Is this just an attempt 
to sound humble, or am I looking at it from the wrong angle?
    
I admit that in these times it may not be possible for a Mohtasib, or even 
perhaps for a computer, to keep track of the misdemeanours of ministers and 
elected representatives, but let us, for Gods sake, reintroduce some old 
respected traditions and practices of democratic government. That of 
ultimate responsibility, for example.
    
The long years of military rule have played havoc with these traditions and 
practices, and what sounded ethical, say, 20 years ago may appear to be 
foolish and unnecessary today. Add to this the complete failure of elected 
regimes since 1988 to support, encourage and respect traditional values, 
and its no surprise to find our politics at the nadir of self-degradation, 
individually as well as collectively.
    
Now that a new regime has come into power, elected by an overwhelming 
majority, and promises to conduct itself on a moral plane in all spheres of 
national life, let us see what it has to offer that is different and good 
and decent. It would be prudent, however, to keep our fingers crossed.

<a name="mujt">Mujtaba, 91, helps Pakistan lift SAARC trophy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Saeed

DHAKA, Feb 28: Favourites Pakistan A lifted the 3rd SAARC Cricket Trophy 
beating holders India A by virtue of better run-rate in the rain-marred 
final at the Dhaka Stadium today.
    
The final match between the two arch rivals earlier began at 10.40 a.m. 
(local time), 85 minutes late due to heavy fog in the morning with the tie 
reduced to 44 overs.
    
Put to bat first, Pakistan, A were all out for 199 runs in 43.2 overs with 
skipper Asif Mujtaba topscoring with 91 runs in 104 balls.
    
Mujtaba was caught 9 runs short of his maiden SAARC century, but his 
captains knock won him the Man of the Match award. He also received the 
Man of the Tournament award for his prolific batting in the competition.
    
In reply, India A managed to score 124 runs losing 5 wickets in 31 overs 
with a S. Sarath and S. Prasad batting on 35 and 3 runs respectively.
    
But then the Dhaka afternoon sky gave in and poured 2 mm rains in 10 
minutes that halted the match. Finally, the last showdown had to be 
abandoned, putting a gloomy end to the four-nation biennial meet which 
opened on Feb 19.
    
Pakistan A were declared champions according to the run-rate as holders 
India A were still 39 runs short of the asking runs in 31 overs. India 
needed 163 runs in 31 runs to win the match on better run-rate.
    
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed distributed the trophies as chief guest 
at a simple ceremony.

<a name="zahe">Zaheer wants more regional cricket matches</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

DHAKA, Feb. 26: Zaheer Abbas, manager of the Pakistan A cricket team now 
plying the SAARC tournament, is delighted to be in Dhaka heading the 
favourite of the current engagement.
    
In an interview with English daily The Star he said he was always happy 
to be in Dhaka where he delighted huge cricket-loving crowd during his 
playing days.
    
Daily Star (DS): What has been your thought on the tournament so far?
    
Zaheer Abbas (ZA): It has been a very good tournament, nicely organised. 
The only thing I am disappointed with is the absence of big crowds. After a 
full house in the first match I expected similar crowds in the subsequent 
games. Unfortunately, that has not happened.
    
DS: And your teams performance?
    
ZA: It has been good except for the wides and no-balls. The main reason for 
that is that the bowlers are bowling without studs and spikes on their 
boots. They are also bowling on a surface unfamiliar to them. Otherwise 
they are usually very accurate.
    
DS: What do you think of the Bangladesh side?
    
ZA: They have improved quite a lot in the last few years and I expect them 
to improve even more in the near future. Since you have someone like Gordon 
Greenidge, there is more scope for improvement. It will also help develop 
specific skills. I think it is a good sign that you are getting 
professionals from different fields.
    
DS: How you think countries like Bangladesh should go about developing 
their cricket?
    
ZA: The most important thing is exposure. You have to go abroad more often 
and get exposure. For example, when Sri Lanka first came to the 
international scene, they went abroad frequently and that is how they 
developed. I think you should start off by visiting the SAARC countries  
Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. Playing in their domestic tournaments, like 
one of your teams is doing now in Pakistan, will help too. Only with such 
exposure can you learn about your faults and develop your technique. You 
could also hold this SAARC tournament more frequently.
    
DS: How much scope do you think does Bangladesh have for developing in 
cricket?
    
ZA: You have tremendous scope. You see, three SAARC countries have won the 
World Cup and are the top teams in the world today. So why can Bangladesh 
not do well and go on to play at the international level? The atmosphere 
here is conducive to cricket: there is a lot of interest in the game and 
with proper initiative Bangladesh should be able to reach that stage. The 
people here love this game and you should develop the game as quickly as 
possible.
    
DS: Of late, Pakistan has been producing a number of quality young players. 
What do you think is the reason behind this trend?
    
ZA: Talented youngsters have always been there but it all depends on the 
selectors if they are to surface internationally. I am in the selection 
committee and we do not mind taking a few risks. We have to show our 
confidence in youngsters. We have even given break to some body as young as 
Hassan Raza, the 14-year-old kid. This also serves as an incentive to 
upcoming players. Every parent will now tell their child that he could play 
for Pakistan even at the age of fourteen only if he is good enough. This 
works as a psychological boost.
    
DS: Players like Mohammad Wasim, Saqlain Mushtaq and Shahid Afridi have 
shown good temperament despite being newcomers to the international stage. 
How has this been possible?
    
ZA: We have a high standard of cricket in domestic competitions as we take 
our game very seriously. The boys are used to playing competitive cricket. 
They also play for different companies back home and to keep their jobs, 
they have to try and improve constantly. This helps to improve the standard 
and also to build temperament.
    
DS: What is the criterion of selection for the Pakistan side?
    
ZA: Apart from ability and current form, discipline and approach to the 
game are considered. But in my opinion fielding is a very important factor. 
Regardless of the fact that you are a world class batsman or bowler, if you 
can not field well, you have no room on my team. It is very simple - 
fielding is the first priority.
    
DS: Pakistan had gone through a phase of a disciplinary crisis of sorts a 
few yeas back. Now things seem to have settled down. How has such a 
transition been possible?
    
ZA: The change actually took place as more youngsters came up. Now we have 
got less player-power as we have developed a good team of back-up players. 
Anyone  whether he is a world class player or not  can be replaced by a 
younger player. A competent replacement is always available. No one in the 
Pakistan team is indispensable.
    
DS: So you think players like Mohammed Zahid and Shahid Nazir can step into 
the boots of Wasim Akram or Waqar Younis even?
    
ZA: That only time can tell, but they definitely have the potential to do 
so.
    
DS: What is the actual role of a manager in modern-day cricket?
    
ZA: The manager is there to solve problems for the players. We are here to 
help them out, to constantly guide them. The boys out there are not 
computers, they have to be told what is good for them and what is bad. It 
helps when the manager himself is an ex-player as he can understand the 
players problems better. I think having a good manager definitely affects 
a team.
    
DS: India and Pakistan have not played a series against each other at home 
for some time now? Do you think this trend should change?
    
ZA: They should definitely play frequently. Understandably, there is always 
a fear of unrest among the public. But I think this will normalise if more 
matches are played. Otherwise, all the tension is concentrated on one or 
two games only. We should also play with each other to improve our games. 
If we play among ourselves in the SAARC region, it will help all the 
countries develop better technique and temperament. That will help our 
region to claim the top spot in world cricket. In that respect, this 
current tournament is a good step.

A. Majid Khan

KARACHI, Feb. 24: World Open record holder Jansher Khan today announced to 
skip the PSA Super Series finals in case the new American scoring system of 
nine points is not altered to by 15 points.
    
Addressing a Press conference at the PIA headquarters soon after his 
reception was over, world champion Jansher Khan said that he had informed 
today his London manager to contact the Professionals Squash Association 
(PSA) Executive Director John Nimick on his conditionality of participation 
in the top eight-man contest of the Super Series standing.
    
Jansher urged that the PSA Super Series should be contested on 15 points 
system and not on nine points. Last year I competed in the event and the 
experimental nine points system, according to him, resulted in his defeat 
on the eve of the British Open. It had a bad psychological effect, though 
he retained the British open title for the fifth successive year last year, 
the champion added.

<a name="hock">Pakistans hockey potential</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Syed Mohammad

Pakistans prospects in the coming Olympic games were bright to some my 
statement may seem strange. But it is not. I say so because hockey is in 
her blood as it is in the blood of other South Asian teams. But Pakistani 
players are tougher then other South Asia.
    
However, hard the Europeans may try they cannot acquire the natural talent 
with which South Asians have been gifted because of their sharper reflexes. 
European supremacy depends on changed rules and change in the playing 
surface and scientific physical training hard hitting, fast running and 
bulldozing. These can be thwarted by clean stick work.
    
What is needed is the attention of the Pakistan Hockey Federation. It has 
to ensure that the toughness the players possess has to be maintained. The 
players have to be looked after. Nourishing and light food, exertion to 
capacity of each player. The amount of rest needed by each player. Every 
player should be provided the kind he needs.
    
Then comes the most important thing i.e. coaching. The coaches should not 
be left to do what they like. Then work had to be supervised. Wholesale 
coaching is not the answer.
    
Individual coaching as opposed to collective coaching is the key point for 
improving the performance of players. After mastery of ball control and 
stick work, players have to be taught team work. This is done during the 
course of games played for improving team work.
    
Forwards have to be taught dodging dribbling and short passing, while 
defenders have to be taught accuracy in tackling. Forwards have to be 
taught to make opening for penetrating enemy defence. Defenders have to be 
taught to block the openings enemy forward have been trying to make.
    
Defending players have to be taught accuracy in tackling and interception 
of enemy passes.
    
At the conclusion of each field game after the players have changed into 
dry and warm clothing and had ample nourishing refreshments, faults should 
be discussed. During the field game on the following day players should be 
directed to avoid the faults committed in the game played during the 
previous day.

WHICH is the best and most varied bowling side today for consistent effort

Clive Lloyd of the West Indies, had but to intervene and give his ruling in 
favour of Lanka. Jayasuriya, the bowler, was unplayable; his slow stuff, 
sent with amazing steadiness, harried the Indian batsmen. 
    
In the final, the Lankans beat the redoubtable Australians by seven wickets 
to lift the coveted cup for global one-dayers. However, cricket observers 
and critics can, under no circumstance, agree that the island attack is the 
most balanced, if not the most destructive. Is Chaminda Vaas, their medium-
pacer, in the class of Allan Donald, the South African, or Curtly Ambrose, 
the West Indian. Certainly no spinner of the island can be bracketed with 
Warne and Tim May for his spinning art. 
    
The Australian bowling, minus Craig McDermotts velocity and double-swing, 
has lost its force and sting, whatever may be the physical strength of 
McGrath, Angel and Reiffel. The Australians, no doubt, have a consistent 
artist and a classical spinner in Shane Warne, who is a pleasure to watch. 
His guile would worry the most organised batsmen but where are the fearsome 
match-winning pacers? The late Leonard Hutton, knighted for batsmanship and 
captaincy, once described the Australian attack of the 1950-51 series as 
the most varied and difficult one of the post-War era. Lindwall and Miller 
formed a ferocious new-ball pair. Then came Bill Johnston with his cutters. 
Ian Johnson and Jack Iverson provided the variety but the whole bowling set 
taxed the skill and technique of the batsmen, English, South African and 
the West Indian, considering that the three Ws  Worrell, Weekes and 
Walcott  were then at the apogee of their form. Perhaps during the Bradman 
captaincy from 1946 to 1948 the Australian bowling had the same all-round 
excellence as stated by Hutton except that Dooland, McCool, Ring and 
Johnson were backing the fast attack since Iverson had an entry in the Test 
team much later. 
    
The Australian combination of Gregory, McDonald and Mailey had the force 
and fire of true seamers and the dexterity of a spinner. But after a few 
years McDonald left Australia to demonstrate his demolition act at 
Lancashire. Mailey, as experts are agreed, was too expensive. The Grimmett-
Mailey pairing did not last long for the latter left the Test scene in 1926 
for the inimitable Clarrie Grimmett to alone exhibit his clever spin and 
deceitful googly. But where was the brute force with the springing strides 
of Lindwall, Miller and Johnston? 
    
England had a strong attack in the fifties with Bedser, Statham and Trueman 
quite dangerous for the Australians as also the Carribbeans. Then Laker and 
Lock dazzled the onlookers with their variations of flight and spin. The 
bowling had balance and variety. Yet what is the English bowling of today? 
Certainly it cannot be compared with the bowlers of yore. Even most of the 
West Indian trundlers, leaving aside Curtly Ambrose, are getting old. A new 
energetic lot will have to take over from them. Gilchrist, Hall, Holder, 
Holding, Clarke, Marshall, Croft and Garner, with venomous and nasty speed 
left competitive cricket, as everybody has to do, long ago and the 
Caribbeans have no more breath-snatching speed merchants. 
    
One can risk a claim that Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram of Pakistan form the 
most dangerous and effective fast bowling duo in the present-day cricket-
playing countries. The pair will shake the batsmen with sheer speed or 
slight change of pace. The long run and galloping stride of Waqar would 
make the rival batsmen fearful of the bowler. Then the alarming pace would 
strain the nerves of many a technically-sound batsman. Wasim has few peers 
as a new-ball bowler. With the perfect shape of a pacer Wasim would send 
his swinging, bouncing deliveries to puzzle the batsmen and get an early 
breakthrough. If Aqib Javed may not have been sidelined from the mainstream 
outfit for reasons better known to the officialdom of the cricket board, 
perhaps Pakistan may be called to be having the most menacing fast attack. 
Yet the two Ws are in a class into their own. As Mushtaq Ahmad and Saqlain 
Mushtaq come to show their pretty and clever bowling the variety is 
enthralling to behold. It is the most balanced attack both for the sweat 
and labour of one-day as well as for five-day tussles of Test matches. 
    
The Pakistani bowling is good enough to wreak havoc on any field, at home 
or away. If the team is let down it is only by a brittle middle-order or if 
one of the regular opening batsmen is ill or is driven out of the squad for 
reasons other than cricket.
