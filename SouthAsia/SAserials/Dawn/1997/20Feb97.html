<a name="name">Names of many rich Pakistanis also to come into limelight</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

WASHINGTON, Feb. 17: The noose of illegal foreign campaign donations is 
tightening around the second Clinton presidency at a stunning speed and 
soon many big names, including a lot of wealthy Pakistanis, will come into 
limelight, analysts said on Sunday.

The latest move in the hitherto slow-moving process came on Sunday when an 
important chairman of a House sub-committee demanded the entire White House 
database, called "Big Brother", which lists all the names of donors and 
supporters of the Clinton campaign.

The database has not been handed over to the committee yet and Congressman 
David M. McIntosh threatened on Sunday he would issue a legal subpoena to 
secure Big Brother.

Analysts said the database, which includes some 350,000 names, including 
everyone who has ever come into contact with the Clintons since they moved 
into the White House, could turn out to be highly embarrassing as it may 
include many such names who neither the Clintons nor the visitors would 
like to divulge.

So far Pakistanis who made contributions to the Clinton campaign have 
remained protected as nothing illegal was detected in their donations or 
source of their funds but this may not remain as such once full disclosures 
are made to the congressional committee.

The only prominent name which has figured so far is that of Maryland 
businessman Rashid Choudhry, who is said to have donated $340,000 to the 
Clinton campaign which gave him access not just to the White House but even 
to Air Force One, the president's personal aircraft.

The scandal has been widening ever since Indonesians, Koreans and Indians 
were found involved making illegal donations to the Clinton campaign, most 
of which were returned to the donors.

Already 52 subpoenas have been issued by Congress which include all the 
leading government officials and private donors based in the US and once 
the circus of hearings begins, the Clintons would find themselves in an 
increasingly difficult situation, analysts say.

One such embarrassing aspect of the donations has been the availability of 
the Lincoln bedroom in the White House to donors who contributed in six 
figures.

Cartoonists and columnists have preyed on the Lincoln Bedroom scandal with 
relish and the Clintons have occasionally been made to look like running an 
infamous house in the red light area where bedrooms were up for hire at a 
price.

The White House denies that the Big Brother was used for political purposes 
and maintains that it was created to help the president send Christmas 
cards to his friends and supporters.

<a name="bena">Benazir backs PM's call to overseas Pakistanis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 17: Opposition leader in the National Assembly, Ms Benazir 
Bhutto, on Monday supported Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's call to the 
overseas Pakistanis to send $1,000 each to overcome the economic crises in 
the country.

"I also appeal to the Pakistanis living abroad to send $1,000 each so that 
Pakistan can get a breathing space," Ms Bhutto said in her first speech as 
leader of the opposition in the new assembly in which she welcomed the 
prime minister on his election as leader of the house.

The former prime minister said while the money sent by the overseas 
Pakistanis will help in increasing Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves and 
to make debt repayments, the government in the meantime should sell the 
state-run enterprises and the proceeds from the privatisation should then 
be spent on debt-repayment.

Ms Bhutto said it was to her credit that the PPP government was the first 
to repay the foreign debts from the proceeds of the privatisation. "We paid 
$1 billion foreign debt from privatisation proceeds," she added.  She 
disagreed with Nawaz Sharif's proposal of cutting civilian non-development 
expenditure which she said was only 12 per cent of the total budget. She 
said the civilian non-development expenditure includes salaries of para-
military forces and expenses on Pakistani missions abroad.

<a name="read">Benazir ready to head foreign affairs body</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 17: Former prime minister and leader of the opposition in 
the National Assembly, Ms Benazir Bhutto, said on Monday she would consider 
accepting the chairmanship of the NA's Foreign Affairs Committee, if 
offered by the government.

"If it is in the interest of the nation, I might consider accepting this 
office," she said in response to a question when asked to elaborate how her 
party could cooperate with the PML.

Ms Bhutto had accepted the office of chairperson of Foreign Affairs 
Committee when she was opposition leader in 1990.

Responding to questions in the parliament building after the election of 
the leader of the House, Ms Bhutto demanded of the new prime minister to 
repeal the controversial 8th Amendment. However, surprisingly, she did 
neither make this demand nor raise this issue in her assembly speech 
earlier although people sitting in the galleries were expecting her of 
making such a demand as she had been a victim of Article 58 (2)(b), a part 
of 8th Amendment, twice.

Ms Bhutto said Nawaz Sharif's party had achieved two-thirds majority in the 
217-member house. "Now he has two-thirds majority in the house, he must 
take some practical step to undo the 8th Amendment."

<a name="swor">Nawaz sworn in PM: Drastic economic surgery pledged</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb. 17: The newly elected Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif said 
on Monday that "Pakistan is facing worst economic situation" and pledged 
that he "will carry out a major surgery and a drastic cut in expenditure".

Mr Sharif, who secured 177 votes against 16 of the PPP nominee Mr Aftab 
Shahban Mirani to become leader of the house, said that without this 
drastic step, the country could not surmount its economic problems and this 
painful treatment was urgently needed.  He said that many institutions were 
on the verge of collapse and required overhauling and added: "It is my 
promise with the people that I will not sit idle until I solve their 
problems."

The bonhomie and the spirit of mutual accommodation witnessed in the 
National Assembly on Sunday was lacking as neither the PML and its allies 
sought unanimous election of the leader of the house nor did the PPP made 
any conciliatory gesture in this regard.

Mian Nawaz Sharif said the massive mandate given to his party by the people 
had enabled him to take drastic steps to surmount the economic predicament 
and bring political stability.  He lashed out at the administration and 
police which he said were the most corrupt institutions in the country. 
"This (police) institution is not worth calling the police," he said 
adding: "How can you call it police when it cannot protect the life of 
citizens? "There is a need to revamp the police through revolutionary 
measures," he said adding that his government would hold accountability of 
police officers as well as those running the administration. "We will not 
show leniency towards anyone". Terming the massive mandate as a "silent 
revolution", he said such revolutions were normally accompanied with 
bloodshed. "It was a silent revolution which occurred on Feb. 3." But he 
emphasised that his party would not misuse this mandate and try to move 
ahead in the right direction.

Mr Sharif dwelt on a number of issues confronting the country, particularly 
the economic crisis and corruption, which he said, had eaten up the very 
fabric of the society. In his short speech, punctuated with thunderous 
applause from the members, Nawaz Sharif announced that he had buried once 
and for all the politics of victimisation in the country and would adopt a 
path of mutual trust and understanding with the opposition.

Nawaz Sharif said the nation had given a massive mandate for the second 
time to Pakistan Muslim League.  The first time it was given to Quaid-i-
Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah for the creation of the country. "This mandate 
should be used neither for myself nor for any other individual but for the 
betterment of the country." He said the nation was faced with serious 
problems. "The economic situation is such that we have to take loans to 
repay loans."

Nawaz Sharif said that during the past 50 years successive governments had 
been taking loans but wondered where all the loan money had gone. "The 
economy is running on loans. It needs a major surgery otherwise our entire 
gross national product will be spent on debt servicing and nothing will be 
left for expenditures. I request the opposition to guide us."

He said the situation had reached an alarming state and unemployment, 
corruption, lawlessness and dacoities had become rampant.  "There is 
unemployment and illiteracy," he said. "Tyranny, injustice, sectarianism 
and dacoities have become the order of the day." He said Pakistan was 
blessed with fertile lands and abundant water resources. But, he regretted, 
that the resources had not been exploited and though the country's economy 
was agrarian, Pakistan was importing three million tonnes of wheat annually 
to meet its requirements.

Nawaz Sharif said his government would endeavour to bring a revolution in 
the lives of the people by providing relief to farmers, labourers and the 
poor.  He said vast areas of land were barren in the country which would be 
distributed among the farmers to grow crops. Similarly, water theft from 
canals and water courses would be checked to ensure that the tail-end 
farmers get their due share of water. The prices of agricultural 
commodities would also be enhanced to give them their due share, he said.

Referring to the problem of unemployment, Mr Sharif said it had increased 
over the past few years because of closure of factories and mills. He said 
many more factories were on the verge of closure.

Nawaz Sharif said he was aware of the problems of the poor people. "I can 
well imagine the difficulties of a man who is getting only Rs 3,000 per 
month and has a family of five." He said it was time to take immediate 
remedial measures to rectify the situation. "There is an urgent need to 
take concrete steps."

The PML chief said sectarianism and law and order were other issues which 
would have to be dealt with on top priority.

Regarding corruption in the society, he said his government would not 
tolerate any corrupt official and deal with them firmly. "We will have to 
recover every paisa looted by them," he said expressing his surprise how 
government officers who were not earning more than Rs10,000 a month were 
living in luxury air-conditioned houses. "How come these people, who did 
not even have a motorcycle when they had joined the service, became owners 
of dozens of bungalows and how they invite 2,000 people on weddings."  He 
said though he did not believe in revenge, he would not spare those who had 
looted the country.

Nawaz Sharif said he would not only continue the process of accountability 
but also strengthen it. "There should be accountability of all, whether 
belonging to the treasury benches or the opposition." He said justice was 
not available to the people and they did not get justice without greasing 
the palms of the officials concerned.

Nawaz Sharif assured the minorities that their rights would be protected at 
all costs as they were equal citizens of the country. "The nation includes 
Muslims and non-Muslims and they have equal rights." He said the government 
would deal with minorities equally and regretted the recent incident in 
Shantinagar where homes and churches of Christians were burnt. He said his 
government would pay compensation to the affected people. "I assure the 
minorities that our treatment towards the minorities will be the same which 
was promised to them by the Quaid-i-Azam." Nawaz Sharif also assured the 
assembly that he would provide a transparent government and contracts would 
be awarded in a transparent manner.

The leader of the House said though he and his party workers had been 
subjected to the worst kind of victimisation during the past three years, 
he would not take revenge from the present opposition. "We will not do what 
they had done to us," he said adding that even if he was found guilty he 
should be tried and punished like any other person.  He said positive 
criticism from the opposition would be welcomed. "It is the right of the 
opposition party to criticise the government policies but criticism should 
not be for the sake of criticism." Similarly, he said, the accountability 
process would be above party politics and not based on victimisation.

Nawaz Sharif said merit would be adopted in every sphere. "I assure you 
that merit would be the only criterion everywhere and we will provide you a 
transparent government."

Following the election of Mr Sharif as the leader of the House in the 
morning, he was sworn in as the prime minister later in the day.

Begum Nusrat and Benazir Bhutto and greeted Begum Nusrat Bhutto who shook 
hands with him. Nawaz Sharif then greeted PPP chairperson Benazir Bhutto 
and expressed his gratitude for making a gesture in acceding to his partys 
request in withdrawing the PPPs candidates Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah for 
the office of the speaker and Mr Naveed Qamar for the office of deputy 
speaker. After staying for some time with Ms Bhutto, Mian Nawaz Sharif 
returned to his seat. This gesture left a good impact in the House and 
galleries. On behalf of the PPP chairperson, Mr Shabbir Chandio 
congratulated the new speaker Mr Soomro on his election.

KARACHI, Feb. 19: FIA deputy director, immigration, Haji Abdul Qadeer on 
Wednesday said the passengers belonging to those countries where Pakistanis 
were required to obtain visa for entry would no more be given the landing 
permit by the FIA and such transitory passengers would be confined to the 
lounges during their interim stay at the airport. The airlines which fly in 
any inadmissible passenger may be fined, he warned. 

The airlines representatives while lauding the performance of the FIA

<a name="shar">Sharifs novel cure for the balance of payments crisis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed
    
MR NAWAZ SHARIF has been following up his overwhelming electoral victory 
and his commitment to give top priority to economic recovery, coming up 
with a novel approach to improve the critical balance of payments.

He has appealed to every Pakistani abroad to send $1,000 to savings 
accounts at home in an effort to reduce the balance of payments deficit 
from a record 6.6 per cent of the GDP last year to 4.4 per cent this year 
as targeted now. Surely, such desperate efforts are imperative after the 
last year recorded a balance of payments deficit in the current account of 
$4.2 billion following the rise in the trade deficit to a staggering $3.66 
billion  from $2.53 billion the year before.

The $1,000 per head sent from abroad will not solve the major problem of 
total foreign debt of over $30 billion including the short-term loans 
hurriedly obtained at high interest rates in recent years; but it marks an 
interesting new beginning if the response is as good as reported initially 
and might have been better if the Eid holidays had not intervened.

To some people, Mr Sharifs appeal reminds them of Quaid-i-Azams appeal 
for silver bullets to fight the cause of Pakistan and particularly to back 
the Muslim League candidates in the elections to the constituent Assembly 
of India but what Mr Sharif wants from the affluent Pakistanis abroad is 
not generous donations but savings in their names in dollars, which the 
government will use, and on which it will pay interest in the manner it 
pays to the depositors in dollar accounts in Pakistan which now total about 
$7 billion. Those who may be sending the dollars will be earning far more 
than what they are earning abroad on dollar deposits but less than what 
Pakistan has to pay for short-term loans now.

Pakistanis overseas are estimated at two million and if all of them send 
$1,000 each, the total will be only $2 billion compared to the foreign debt 
of over $30 billion. However, the deposits sent by Pakistanis is not to be 
used to repay foreign loans as much as to improve the foreign exchange 
deficit which has sunk to a low of $800 million even after the recent 
improvements  from $2,065 million on June 30 last year and $2,737 million 
on June 30, 1995.

The target for June 30, this year is $2,331 million while even the very 
modest target of $1 billion by the end of 1996 could not be reached by 
December despite the caretaker governments efforts, inclusive of short-
term borrowing from banks abroad and the IMF.

Out of the two million Pakistanis abroad, about a third may be wives and 
children. Hence the total, even if each of the adults sends $1,000 per 
head, would be rather small.

Some argue, the overseas Pakistanis including those who have become 
nationals of other countries in the West, number three million. In that 
case too, the total receivable on the basis of $1000 per capita would be 
small. Since Mr Nawaz Sharif is not appealing for donations but only small 
savings deposits many of them could send far more than $1,000 per capita.

In fact, a sizeable number of them have already sent a good deal of foreign 
exchange. That is how their deposits in Pakistan banks are around $1.5 
billion and more. And, some say, much of these accounts opened in the names 
of Pakistanis overseas is in reality accounts of resident Pakistanis opened 
in the names their relations abroad.

The total amount of money held by Pakistanis abroad now, according to 
guestimates is $50 to 60 billion, and that includes a good deal of drug 
money, large kickbacks obtained by Pakistani industrialists on the import 
of machinery, rewards for the vast corruption and crimes committed within 
the country, including large bribes obtained by various taxation officers 
who got their bribes paid abroad.

So much of these vast fruits of corruption and veritable crimes may not 
come back home in a large measure. In fact some of that money has come into 
the foreign exchange deposits of Pakistanis overseas and resident, which 
total about $7 billion.

As such, Mr Nawaz Sharif is not asking the large foreign exchange deposit 
holders or asset owners to bring in large amounts to Pakistan but urged 
every Pakistani to send $1,000 per-capita to be retained in their savings 
accounts here.

In rupee terms, the depositors may earn about 20 per cent a year through an 
average devaluation of the rupee by 12 per cent annually, the 6.5 per cent 
interest in foreign exchange and exemption from the 10 per cent withholding 
tax on interest earnings or profit. Even without the 12 per cent 
devaluation, 6.5 per cent interest earnings along with the exemption from 
the 10 per cent withholding tax is attractive for Pakistanis overseas whose 
interest earnings on their deposits is very low abroad.

In not appealing to the more affluent Pakistanis abroad and those who made 
money illegally here and sent it abroad, Mr Nawaz Sharif is being 
realistic. India has been appealing to its larger overseas Indians 
community to come and invest in their homeland but their investment has 
been very poor.

Some of them invested modest sums and then disinvested and went back. Some 
asked for excessively generous terms by Indian standards for making large 
investments and India could not agree to that.

Recently when a major conference of Indian industrialists appealed to Prime 
Minister Deve Gowda for various tax concessions, monetary reliefs and 
incentives, he told them they were all the time talking of the rapid 
economic leaps China was taking, but the fact was, he maintained, that 80 
per cent of the foreign investment in China was done by overseas Chinese.

He wanted the Indians overseas to do likewise and make India economically 
strong instead of demanding more concessions and reliefs all the time.

If Mr Nawaz Sharif makes good use of the $1,000 per-capita from abroad he 
is appealing for now and revives the economy and moves ahead steadily, 
certainly far more deposits can come from abroad. How much will come 
finally depends on his economic performance which should cut out the 
pervasive corruption at one end and the officials inefficiency and red tape 
on the other and put the existing industries to the best use and increase 
industrial and farm productivity.

In that area, the industrialists and businessmen have to help him and the 
country instead of only asking for more and more concessions and incentives 
galore. He has to talk to them and make them play an enlightened role.

Those who have deposited over $7 billion in Pakistani banks now see the 
government had consumed all that money and is left with a foreign exchange 
reserve of $800 million after heavy short-term borrowing and IMF 
assistance.

Compared to that, India has made use of much of those deposits, minus the 
short-term deposits, to build its foreign exchange reserve which now stands 
at $19.7 billion.

The kind of wasteful performance the Benazir government indulged in will 
not do. Instead the depositors from abroad and at home have to see the 
government making better use of the dollars deposited by them. And that 
could bring in far more deposits to build a better reserve.

*From this initial move for attracting small deposits form Pakistanis 
abroad, Mr Nawaz Sharif has to move soon towards attracting the richer 
Pakistanis abroad to make real investments in Pakistan either directly or 
in partnership with others or through large scale buying of shares.

All that will depend on the ultimate response to his current appeal for 
small deposits and how well they are used and how soon the economy returns 
to the tracks.

The first 100 days of the Nawaz Sharif government will be very important 
but not for its immediate achievements but the sense of direction of the 
government and its political will. So he will have to move both decisively 
and cautiously, eschewing the follies of his own government as well as 
Benazir Bhuttos which had collectively damaged the economy a great deal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Farrukh Saleem

THE MOST notorious gangster of the 20th century who dominated organised 
crime, acknowledged czar of gambling, prostitution and also bootlegging, 
was the crowned king of the illegal liquor traffic during the Prohibition 
Era. The man was declared Public Enemy Number 1 by the Chicago Crime 
Commission. Someone whose income was judged to be $2 million per week, a 
colossal $105 million for the income tax year 1927.

Alphonse Capone, Scarface to us. Fourth of nine children, born and raised 
in Brooklyn by Italian immigrant-parents who had moved to the New York 
vicinity only six years before his birth. Capone quit school right after 
the 6th grade to gang up with Johnny Torrios James Street Boys gang in 
1920.

Johnny sent Capone to Chicago to work for Big Jim Colosimo, who was then 
the head of Chicagos largest prostitution and gambling ring. Colosimo was 
allegedly killed by the young Capone, who then look over Colosimos 
prostitution and gambling empire, adding to it the enormously profitable 
bootlegging business.

At the age of 26, Capone had full control over at least 1,000 of Americas 
most dangerous gangsters who were collectively generating profits of over 
$100 million a year and were paid more than $300,000 a week by Capone 
himself.

For more than 20 years, all the police did was to chase Capone around while 
the most powerful mob boss of his era went around his brothels, gambling 
dens, bootlegging operations, assassinating rivals, ordering murders and 
along the way sucking tens of millions of dollars in illegal profits. One 
of the most powerful police on the face of this planet could not lay a 
charge on Capone that would hold. The gangsters always managed to remain a 
few steps ahead of them.

For a good part of two decades, Al Capone remained absolutely immune to 
prosecution for any and all of his criminal activities. In June 1930, 
Capone was finally indicted not on a murder charge, bootlegging or for any 
of his other seriously criminal undertakings but on a much lesser charge of 
federal income tax evasion.

Thus one of the most notorious criminals of the 20th century was imprisoned 
for tax evasion. All of the resources of the American police, FBI and other 
federal authorities failed to collect any evidence to prove that Al Capone 
was a dangerous criminal. At the end of the day, he had to be imprisoned 
for evading federal income taxes.

The trial began on October 7, 1930. Capone had retained one of the highest 
paid team of lawyers, muscle-men and manipulators who appeared fully 
confident of a win. The jury, it is said, had already been tampered with. 
At the very last minute, however, the judge on the case was changed. Judge 
Wilkerson took over from Judge Edwards and also brought into the courtroom 
12 new jurors (who were confined during night).

Still, the government prosecutors could only prove two things. First, that 
Capones lavish spending was evidence of a colossal income. Second, that 
Capone was well aware of his obligations to pay federal income tax but 
failed to do so.

Judge Wilkerson allowed nine hours of deliberations at the end of which the 
jurors found Capone guilty of three felonies and two misdemeanours, all 
five relating to his failure to pay and/or file his income taxes between 
1925 and 1929.

After the jurors found Capone guilty, Judge Wilkerson sentenced Al Capone 
to serve 11 years in prison and to pay $80,000 in fines and court costs. 
(United States of America v, Alphonse Capone, October 17, 1931)

More than 20 years of serious crime including innumerable murders, but the 
entire US government paraphernalia could only prove that Capone was guilty 
of three felonies and two misdemeanours, relating to his failure to pay 
and/or file his income taxes ...

Capone, nevertheless, was sent away to Atlantas federal penitentiary and 
later to the Alcatraz prison. Senile and suffering from syphillis, he was 
paroled in 1939 and died in his Miami Beach mansion on January 25, 1947.

On April 23, 1930, the Chicago Crime Commission had issued its first ever 
Public Enemies List. There were 28 names on it, and Capones was on the 
very top.

If a similar list were to be compiled by our very own Ehtesab Commission we 
night have round 200 names on it.

Although, our thoroughly inept and exhaustively politicised institutions of 
Police, FIA and IB have a 50 year history of failing to do anything good 
for the country, most of these 200 people could very easily be found guilty 
of either federal income tax or wealth tax evasion.

Their lavish spending, outrageous lifestyles, helicopter campaigning, kids 
in America, crores of rupees paid back to banks in order to become eligible 
and other election expenses is all solid evidence of either colossal 
income or of tremendous, undeclared hidden wealth. They are all also very 
well aware of their obligations towards federal income tax and wealth tax.

We all know that the 200 have severely violated almost all laws of the 
land, commissions, kickbacks, looting the national exchequer, fleecing 
state-owned enterprises, robbing nationalised banks and DFIs, criminal 
negligence of education and health while some are even accused of murders.

The President the caretakers and the entire state appear either by design 
or by sheer ineptitude has in the past and would continue to fail in 
delivering what these 200 really deserve. Why not just charge them of tax 
evasion punishable order the Pakistan Penal Code?

Who can really rid this nation of its worst public enemies? Nawaz Sharif 
has an historic opportunity. He has the mandate, the time and all the 
resources in this country at his disposal. The only thing that has been 
lacking in the past has been the will.

<a name="them">The main dilemma facing Nawaz Sharif Govt</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi

ISSUES involved in the transfer of power and the working of the new 
government are not relevant here but one aspect is: hitherto the declared 
main thrust of caretakers and Presidents policies was to bind the 
incoming Nawaz Sharif government to implement in letter and spirit, the 
policy package that the IMF and Shahid Javed Burki have devised for the 
country.
There was the well-publicised need and requisite intent to force the next 
government not to diverge from the policies and quantitative target that 
had been basically set by the IMF. The question is, would Mian Nawaz Sharif 
and his government meekly sign on the dotted line and act accordingly?

The people of Pakistan have given him a mandate of an extraordinary kind. 
It empowers him to do new things and not to remain stuck in the old 
grooves. People were being crushed in the jaws of the twin vices of 
inflation and unemployment. Morally and politically the new government is 
bound to provide relief to the people of the lower income brackets.

If the new government accepts the old programme in toto, the prospects in 
the future for the common folks will worsen: the cost of living will rise 
further while the chances of new employment creation will become even less. 
That will speedily discredit Mian Sahib.

Whether the country would in future be inundated with rivers of milk and 
honey as a result of strictly following the IMF prescription does not seem 
likely, at best that may happen after God knows what length of time. But in 
the meanwhile the economic pain of the adjustments, on the basis of the 
programme hitherto followed, is sure to be passed on the poorer sections 
while the fat cats become fatter still.

To be sure, the people can be enlightened enough, under certain 
circumstances, to undergo much pain and travail if at the end of some 
specified period the troubles begin to end and prospects of progress become 
brighter in a credible fashion. However, it has to be shown convincingly 
that the progress later will actually improve the lot of the common man.

As it happens the conditions now are that following the IMF programme in 
letter and spirit, in no matter what time-frame, the result is likely to be 
a bust up and a collapse rather than any improvement whatsoever.

This is not an absolute statement regarding the validity of IMFs 
recommendations. It is predicated on Pakistans specific conditions today 
after the gross mismanagement and misallocation of the resources of the 
past 50 years.

Even the official rate of inflation does not really signify what it badly 
says; the accumulated and built-in inflationary pressures have reached a 
point where the economy simply refuses to respond in the normal or expected 
ways. No known remedy now applies.

The politics involved in economic policies is a necessary ingredient. It 
has to be taken into serious consideration. The new government will be 
committing suicide if it supinely agrees to carry on from where Benazir and 
Burki have left off. There is no knowing as to what final decision the 
Premier-designate is going to take.

Politics of economics

The only available indication is the statement that Mr Sartaj Aziz, former 
finance minister in the earlier PML government, made soon after the 
election. He said that it would not be possible for the new Nawaz 
government to hit all the IMF-suggested targets by June 30 next, especially 
the budget deficit at 4 per cent of GDP and associated limitations on bank 
borrowings and new money creation.

On the other hand, the Finance Ministry is said to have prepared a report 
for the incoming PM that outlines what has got to be done: it spells out 
the specific commitments given by the Benazir government and reiterated by 
the caretakers to the IMF for which it may have to increase gas and 
electricity tariffs and POL products prices by 15 to 20 per cent and 
impose new taxes to the tune of Rs 20 billion immediately and certainly 
well before the next budget  in order to ensure greater and early 
collection of revenues in which a heavy shortfall (of Rs 41 billion) has 
been reported during the last seven months.

If this is to be done, one more dose of devaluation might also not be 
avoidable. Supposing Mian Sahib does that, will that mean the achievement 
of IMF targets? And will that lift the economy on to the path of self-
reliant progress?

That is the moot point. The previous government had imposed new taxes worth 
Rs 120 billion over the last few years. The fact of the matter is that the 
expert assessment that Rs 120 billion will be collected from the economy, 
without diminution in the collection of other and older taxes, has proved 
erroneous. All collections have shown shortfalls. Why? because, first, a 
saturation point seems to have been reached in taxation; and secondly, the 
economy is not accelerating enough.

On the contrary, it is, at its most hopeful, ticking over and is largely 
stagnant, even if the government does not recognise the fact of recession 
in at least its large-scale industrial sector having taken hold during the 
last two years or so. On the side, the sharp cutting down of government 
expenditures while increasing taxes can only intensify the recession in 
which new job creation will not only not take place but unemployment is 
sure to increase.

Inflation

As for inflation being reduced by high taxation, the opposite has been the 
result. How so it may be asked. Normally mopping up extra incomes through 
more taxes should reduce inflationary pressures and thus prices.

That has not happened in Pakistan. Why? This is so because of the nature of 
most of the new taxes to which the government is resorting in desperation:

Increases in POL prices and gas and electric tariffs directly increase 
prices and cost of living that quickly gets reflected in higher costs of 
transportation and production. Ultimately inflation is intensified by 
adding to the cost structure of the economy, blasting radically the basis 
of the governments own export promotion by reducing both the export 
surplus and making the prices of Pakistani products non-competitive. Which 
then requires more devaluation and which will further accentuate costs and 
result in more inflation  and infitum, unless something now and effective 
is done.

It is to be hoped that Mian Nawaz Sharif understands this peculiar 
situation. The fact of the matter is that the expertise employed by the 
World Bank and IMF  supplemented by economists who have their careers 
hooked to the goodwill of multilateral agencies  goes simply off the 
tangent.

It is not that their prescriptions are inherently wrong. What actually is 
the matter is that they do not apply to Pakistan in its present sick and 
aggravated condition. This statement needs further elaboration.

One reason why recommendations made by IMF experts do not now apply is 
because the successive Pakistan governments have actually twisted their 
intent.

It is not this writers contention that reducing budget deficit does not 
result in reduction in inflation and improve normal conditions. If that 
were the case, it would be foolish. The practice of cutting non-productive 
expenditures has been fundamentally flawed.

They simply cut social sector spending, while leaving intact the 
expenditures on debt servicing, defence and the bloated administration  
that largely means footing the bill of internal security operations, 
paramilitary forces and the vast undercover services. Very little is left, 
then, to cut, And what is cut is the unkindest of cuts. The government thus 
shoots itself in the foot by cutting or needlessly limiting current 
expenditures on education, health and community or economic services. 
Future growth is thus being both limited and distorted.

There is another kind of cut that Benazir has applied and more is likely to 
follow: it is development spending. One hesitates to condemn this 
theoretically unsound approach.

If one could be sure that all development spending actually results in some 
development, the cut would be totally unacceptable and morally wrong. As it 
happens, much of the development spending in fact pays for a needlessly 
huge bureaucracy with very little net development. 

There is far too much of fat in the development budgeting and far too much 
of distorted priorities and corrupt practices in both the selection of 
projects and the choice of technology, not to say corruption in costing. 
Thus such cuts do not necessarily cut development.

Insofar as these malpractice are rampant, cutting down of such development 
spending is no great tragedy. But, other things being equal, the fear is 
that the axe will fall on what may actually be useful and not on what goes 
mainly to sustain bureaucracy by spreading funds too thin over a large 
number of projects, one of which makes actual progress.

This is a separate subject really. Here what can generally be said is that 
the choice of development spending for applying cuts is not right, assuming 
that the development budget conforms to normal criteria.

Few experts in multilateral agencies would insist that this is the right 
approach to cut non-productive expenditures. Common sense suggests that if 
the country is facing a dire crisis and expenditures need to be brought 
down drastically, then debt servicing, defence and administrative 
expenditures have to be substantially slashed by making the government much 
leaner and if necessary meaner.

How it is to be done is simple: given the severity of the national crisis, 
the Nawaz Sharif government will be fully justified in imposing a 
unilateral moratorium of all debt servicing the subject of augmenting 
revenues through forcing the rich folks to pay their due shares and the new 
taxes that actually fall on the richer sections.

It will probably be necessary to discriminate between the Funded Debts and 
the short-term loans from private banks. The latter will have to be paid 
off fairly early, though moratorium in terms of the period should be a much 
shorter duration, say for a year or 18 months. 

During this latter period all the privatisation proceeds should go for the 
repayments of these loans with interest. As for the larger quantum of 
permanent debts, its servicing should be resumed after five years during 
which period, it is to be hoped that the economy would have expanded by a 
respectable margin through notable yearly GDP growths.

Similarly no expert in any multilateral agencies will insist on the kind of 
taxes that Pakistan governments have been imposing every few weeks. Most 
governments have chosen to burden the common consumer and the poorer 
section with additional taxes while leaving the rich farmers, 
industrialists, traders, financiers and other with much lighter load. 
Indeed the rich are among those who pay the least proportionate to the 
incomes.

Moreover, the supply side economics is not gospel: look at our rates of 
savings, households and the national aggregates; the lightly taxed rich 
have not participated in savings and investments. There is plenty of scope 
for increasing savings and investments and savings rates that however is 
not done. Why?

The new PM should ask his and foreign experts to find out and how do these 
rich folks neither pay taxes honestly nor do they save enough to invest. 
What do they do with their high incomes and how? The idea of successive 
Pakistan governments relying heavily on foreign investments is also 
fundamentally unsound. Why would foreigners invest when locals do not.

It is these questions that will have to be attacked at their roots if the 
economy has to be turned around. The kind of tinkering that various 
governments have attempted and failed will no longer do.

Would Mian Nawaz Sharif have the courage to strike out on a new path? Maybe 
he feels it is safer to sign along the dotted line and not fall foul of 
powerful forces at the very start. In the latter case, the decision would 
be fateful and he should then await the results that Benazir successive 
reforms achieved.

<a name="1bil">1 billion dollars may be raised shortly</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Feb. 17: Senior executives of leading commercial banks feel the 
new government may raise shortly at least $1.0 billion by creating the 
proposed fund for foreign debt retirement.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), Governor Dr Muhammad Yaqub on Monday held 
a meeting of the senior executives of five major banks to discuss the 
outlines of the proposed fund. 

Sources close to the meeting said the meeting discussed in detail various 
aspects of the plan and decided to draw up a scheme for its immediate 
implementation. They said the participants of the meeting were of the view 
that the foreign debt retirement scheme announced by Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif may attract at least $1.0 billion shortly. 

They said the SBP chief told the senior executives of National Bank, Habib 
Bank, United Bank, Allied Bank and Muslim Commercial Bank that the new 
government also wanted to draw a plan for local debt retirement. He asked 
them to help the government frame the plan on sound footings taking into 
care all the professional requirements of good banking.

At the end of fiscal year 1995-96, Pakistan foreign debt stood at Rs 
1,004.0 billion or 46.2 per cent of the GDP and local debt at Rs 908.9 
billion or 41.8 per cent of the GDP. Total national debt constituted 88 
percent of the GDP.

This precarious situation demands a revolutionary plan to reduce the debt 
burden and that is why Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto on Monday endorsed 
the initiative taken by Prime Minister Mr Nawaz Sharif for foreign debt 
retirement in a novel fashion. Mr Sharif had appealed to Pakistanis living 
abroad to make donations worth $1000 each in foreign debt retirement fund.  
He had also asked both local citizens as well as Pakistanis living abroad 
to make commercial deposits in the fund the details of which are yet to be 
announced.  It is against this backdrop that the meeting of five major 
banks held at the SBP office reviewed the various aspects of effective 
implementation of the scheme.

"The banks will actually help the government decide the minute details of 
the implementation of the scheme," a source close to the meeting told Dawn. 
He said no targets were set in the meeting but the participants agreed to 
design such medium and long-term deposit schemes that could offer the 
depositors a net annual return of 8-9 per cent on their foreign currency 
accounts depending upon the maturity period of the deposit. He said one way 
of attracting a sizeable amount in the proposed fund could be conversion of 
local foreign currency accounts  be they saving or term-deposit accounts
into a relatively long-term fixed accountspossibly for 2-5 years.

<a name="nfca">NFC award: Provinces may get Rs139.6bn as share</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, Feb. 18: All the four provinces are expected to get a total share 
of Rs 139.6 billion from an estimated total federal taxes revenue pool of 
Rs 372.3 billion during 1997-98, the first year of the operation of the 
recently declared consensus award of National Finance Commission.

Sources connected with the working and implementation of the current 
National Finance Commission award announced last week by the outgoing 
Caretaker government disclosed that Punjab will get a total of Rs 80,808 
million, Sindh Rs 32,502 million, NWFP Rs 18,904 million and Balochistan Rs 
7,399 million in 1997-98.

Estimates of provincial distribution of these funds are based on the 
population ratios worked out by the NFC on the basis of 1981 population 
census. Accordingly Punjabs population ratio has been determined at 
57.88%, Sindh 23.28%, NWFP 13.54% and Balochistan 5.3%.

MATSUSHITA of Japan, Hyundai of South Korea, Virgin of the UK and Wrigley 
of the USA are some of the multinationals whose founders have been school 
dropous.

The founder of Matsushita, Konuke Matsushita, started in 1918 with $50 and 
built the largest consumer electronics company in the world. His fervent 
mission was to provide all households with high quality appliances prices 
as less as possible and to support the greater social good. He is regarded 
as Japans good of business management. the postwar occupation forces 
prevented Matsushita from working at his company for four years. Matsushita 
Electronics entered into a joint venture with Philips in 1952; and began 
producing televisions, refrigerators and washing machines the next year.

By 1960, Matsushita became Japans largest home appliance maker. In 1974, 
the company bought Motorolas US television plants, adding Quaser to its 
brand-name roster. Since 1986, it has expanded its semiconductor, 
automobile electronics, office and factory automation, audiovisual, 
housing, and airconditioning product offerings. Today, Matsushita operats 
354 factories in 39 countries.

The founder of Hyundai Group, Chung Ju-Yung, established Hyundai 
Engineering & Construction in 1947, and Hyundai Motors in 1967. when 
Hyundai Engineering & Construction won a $1 billion contract in the 1970s 
to build a port in Jubail, Ghung saved money by importing Korean parts and 
not insuring the shipments, risking ruin.

The gamble paid off, and Hyundai became a major factor in Middle East 
construction. In 1973, he began building the worlds largest shipyard 
despite having no experience in ship-building. He was successful. His 
success had a backing of their government too.

He established the Ulsan Institute of Technology in 1977 to increase South 
Koreas pool of engineering talent. In 1985, the company closed a plant in 
California when it found that Americans would not regularly work nights and 
weekends, as South Koreans will. Hyundai took advantage of low labour costs 
to start an export drive in the 1980s, beginning shipments of the Pony to 
Canada (1984), where it became #4 in auto sales.

In the US, in 1986, the company first introduced Blue Chip brand IBM-
compatible PCs, and then launched inexpensive Excel subcompact the same 
year, in the most successful imported car launch in US history. Currently, 
though Hyundais US-bound car exports have plunged by one-third, sales 
continue to grow in Europe.

The founder of Wm. Wrigley, Jr., Company, William Wrigley, Jr., started his 
career at 13, by selling door-to-door. In 1891 he moved to Chicago to sell 
soap and baking powder. Two years later he had established Spearmint and 
Juicy Fruit business. 

By 1910 Spearmint gum was the leading US brand, and Wrigley began to expand 
into Canada the same year, Australia in 1915, and Great Britain in 1927. 
Today, Wrigley is #1 chewing gum maker in the world.

The founder of Virgin Group, Richard Branson, dropped out of the 
prestigious Stowe School at 16 to start Student a youth magazine. With no 
publishing experience or money to fund his project, he lured such writers 
as Jean-Paul Sartre and Alice Walker to contribute. Moreover, to keep the 
magazine above water, Branson began a mail-order record business in 1970. 
Sales reached 50 pounds million in 1983, and in 1984 branson launched 
Virgin Atlantic Airways (VA). With only one plane and a London- New York 
route, VA offered two classes: economy and upper. In 1985, Virgin Holidays, 
a tour operator, was formed, complementing the companys airline 
operations. The same year VA won a license to fly to Miami. Today, the 
Virgin Groups three holding companies control more than 100 subsidiaries 
in over a dozen countries. Virgin Atlantics eight planes fly to London, 
Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles Miami, Orlando and Boston. Virgin Group is the 
third largest private company in the UK, and its Retail Group operates 35 
Virgin Megastores.

The saga of the four dropouts in not meant to be narrated to promote 
dropping out of school, but to remind all: it is the initiative in 
enterprise which is superior to that stereotype struggle, on the part of 
our students, to earn degrees, like MBA, CA, ICMA, etc. in the prime of 
their lives and ending up serving one or the other entrepreneur the rest of 
it.

South Korea has produced enterprises such as Samsung, Daewoo, Sunkyong, 
Ssangyong, Hyundai, and Pohang Iron & Steel, which stand among the top 
multinationals of the world. Her greatest enterprise, Samsung, stands at 
rank #18, which is higher to many renowned names, like Unilever (#20), 
Nestle (#26), Honda (#28), Philips (#29), Renault (#30), Boeing (#32), 
Hoechst (#34), and NEC (#39). The question arises, do we also have any 
enterprise which could stand among top 100, or top 200 or even top 500? The 
answer is NO! not as yet.

Nobody can say, our people are inferior to any other people in the world. 
One of our young Pakistanis, Safi Qureshey, along with Albert Wong and Tom 
Yuen, started a high-tech consulting firm in the US in 1979. The three 
Asian-born engineers, working from Yuens garage, set out to make computer 
enhancement and peripheral products. They established AST (Albert, Safi, 
Tom) Research Inc. In 1980. And only four months after IBM came out with 
its PC in 1981, AST Research Inc. had a memory enhancer. In 1983, sales 
reached $12 million, and in 1984 AST went public, raising over $13 million. 
today, AST is the fourth largest American computer maker (after IBM, Apple 
and Compaq), has plants in the US, Hong Kong, Scotland and Taiwan, and 
sales offices in 23 countries. Its products are sold in more than 100 
countries, and its CEO is Safi Qureshey 45, a Pakistani.

There are, in the outside world, many expatriate Pakistanis, equally 
enterprising like Safi Qureshey. Why, then, no enterprise of international 
repute has so far been created within Pakistan?

The euphoria of obtaining university-degrees without learning 
entrepreneurship is the greatest impediment. Our professors, scholars and 
intellectuals ought to address this problem, and devise ways and means to 
encourage entrepreneurship among  at least  prospective students.

<a name="paki">Pakistans exports need quality control</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sarwat Noor

THE FAST-GROWING economies, high standards of living, and rising labour 
wages in industrialised Europe, Japan, and North American countries have 
given rise to a new concept of multinational manufacturing system in which 
components, parts and sub-systems or any particular product are produced by 
companies in different countries and are utilised by the principal 
manufacturers for their final products. It is yet another factor 
contributing to the growth of trade.

The acceptability of these products as suppliers largely depends upon their 
capability to meet the international quality standards. Besides, they are 
also required to give positive understanding about their ability to fulfil 
the delivery commitments.

This has led to the implementation of Quality Assurance Practice during 
design and development of the product and sub- components. It was Japan 
that first realised the need for QA in design and development and by 
implementing these practices it has almost perfect its products. Quality 
control is the most needed item requiring attention for the upcoming 
economies of the developing countries specially in view of the variant 
market, industrial culture and quality perceptions in these countries.

Different laws are being introduced by different countries in respect of 
the standard and quality of products that is acceptable to them for the 
purpose of imports to their country. Accompanying this trend has been a 
growing realisation that continually improvements in quality are often 
necessary to achieve and sustain good economic performance. And one of 
these standards is called ISO-9000.

ISO-9000

In most companies especially in the developing world, although the concept 
of quality is much emphasised, it is hardly adhered to, largely because it 
is subjective. However, with the introduction of ISO-9000, one can 
establish standards of quality in the management system because these 
standards describe comprehensively and systematically the activities 
necessary to achieve quality, as agreed upon by world authorities. 

These standards, if properly adopted, will bring about a professional 
change in a companys business behaviour, from an inspection- based and 
product-oriented quality policy to one which covers all aspects of the 
company.

When the ISO-9000 standards were released, companies in Pakistan thought it 
to be just another exercise in bureaucracy. But they soon found out that 
getting certified to ISO-9000 standards not only helped them compete in the 
international markets, it also improves their profit margins Today, about 
10 Pakistani companies have received the ISO-9000 certificate, another the 
pipeline for accreditation but that leaves a large number of companies who 
should have begun working towards achieving these standards. The companies 
who have received the certification include major multinational companies 
and also small Pakistani companies. By the beginning of the century, 
companies will no longer be allowed to submit bids for their products 
unless they have the required ISO-9000 certification, this will happen 
because there will be enough companies who will have both, the 
certification and the products.

Ever since the Geneva-based International Organisation of Standardisation 
(ISO) issued its first standards series in 1987, many countries that have 
been known to be keen about imparting reliability to the quality of their 
products and services have found it increasingly gainful to acquire these 
standards. Covering a wide range of quality-related management and 
organisational matters, these standards ecompass the functions of various 
departments with the basic idea of eliminating uncertainties about the 
business practices of the manufacturing and service industries as well as 
the quality of their products. The standards set by the ISO are, no doubt, 
quite demanding, but once adopted and certified by the competent 
authorities, they are apt to add immensely to the reputation of the firm, 
placing it on equal footing in reliability with the most trusted names in 
international trade.

Seeing the awareness level in Pakistan about ISO and how the local firms 
work, one can predict a tough time in store for the countrys economy. The 
Pakistan exports are likely to suffer much for only a few firms will, in 
the beginning, be able to get the certificate.

Theoretically, the ISO-9000 only has the positive aspects ensuring 
humanitys well-being by guaranteeing quality product(s) and service(s). 
But practically, it will be hell for Pakistani firms which have to lay more 
emphasis on price than on the quality because people here are price and not 
quality conscious for rampant poverty.

Abroad it is the other way round Just an example: In June 1995, Japan took 
up a legislation for the textile sector which says that if a product causes 
suffering to a Japanese buyer the manufacturer, local or foreigner, will be 
liable to punished under the Japanese law.

Up until now, the Pakistani firms worked in a protected environment, 
fleecing and deceiving local buyers by producing low quality products. The 
fast globalisation of trade will now change the situation. And the country 
will suffer if it prefers to work in a glass box in isolation. Now that a 
stage has come where the fast expanding world market calls for maximum 
effort for quality and efficiency, Pakistan is bound to be faced with the 
challenge of making its products increasingly competitive. One sure way out 
of this situation is to go seriously for adopting the ISO standards and 
thus catch up fast with a number of countries that have succeeded in 
raising their export earnings.

Exports play a vital role in the economic development of Pakistan for 
generating employment opportunities and meeting the import bill for 
purchase of much needed capital goods and industrial raw materials.

There is no denying the fact, that the export of value-added products, not 
only accelerate the rate of foreign exchange inflow, but help strengthen 
the local industrial infrastructure too, so that they could be able to 
compete in the world markets.

<a name="adva">Advancing issues take strong lead over losing ones</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb. 19: Stocks maintained a firm outlook on Wednesday as despite 
profit-selling on a number of counters advancing issues held a strong lead 
over the losing ones amid a brisk traded session.

After early bullish start, the KSE 100-share index finished with a modest 
decline of 4.16 points at 1,758.45 owing to profit-selling in some of the 
leading index shares. Although Hub-Power was back in the plus column after 
news that its 1,292-mw plant has started full production and has already 
been linked to the national gird system, recovering 20 paisa from the 
previous losses, but PTC did not follow its trend. The PTC though suffered 
a fractional decline of only five paisa after fluctuating erratically amid 
alternate bouts of buying and selling but it has bearish impact on some of 
the other pivotals.

 News that its exchangeable bonds are highly oversubscribed on the foreign 
markets should have pushed its price substantially higher but instead it 
encountered selling, dealers said. They said some of the foreign funds are 
selling it to push its prices lower and then to buy for obvious reasons.  
They stated that PTC vouchers might continue to give an erratic performance 
for the some more sessions to come but technically speaking it is a good 
buy at the current level.

Analysts said the fact that a record number of 420 shares came in for 
trading after about two years speaks of the qualitative changes that has 
taken place in the share market and those who could peep through the future 
are active buyers at the current levels.

No one could say some weeks back that the textile sector could again 
assume the role of trend-setter but after about a decade of protracted 
bearishness it is back on the rail and could take the entire market along 
with it in plus territory, they added.

Leading among them posted gains ranging from Rs 3 to Rs 11 under the lead 
of Ellcot Spinning, Sapphire Textiles and Dewan Textiles, paving the way 
for others to follow.

The sudden burst into activity of leasing shares, some of them rising by Rs 
3.25 to Rs 7 and major gainers among them being International Multi-
Leasing, Apex Leasing, Orix Leasing and Atlas Leasing, showed that other 
might follow as leading among them could attract any amount of short-
covering in the sessions to come.

Barring some of the leading energy shares, which came in for profit-selling 
under the lead of Ideal Energy, PSO and Shell Pakistan and finished reacted 
and so did some of the leading cement shares, notably Pakland, Pioneer, 
Essa and Dandot Cement, all other sectors maintained their upward thrust 
and generally ended with an extended gain.

Engro Chemicals whose board of directors has announced final dividend of 
25% for the last financial year and an interim of 30% responded bullishly 
to the news as its share value together with the last three sessions rise 
closed with a fresh gain of Rs 9 amid active trading. Other big gainers 
were led by BOC Pakistan, Lever Brothers, after the news of an interim 
dividend of 30%, and PIC, which posted fresh gains ranging from Rs 13 to Rs 
35,the biggest gain being in PIC, which rose by Rs 95 against its face 
value of Rs 100.  Other good gainers were led by Growth Mutual Fund, Tri-
Star Fund, Asset Bank, EFU and Dadabhoy Insurance, which rose by Rs 1.50 to 
Rs 7.
 
Trading volume soared to 71.272 million shares as compared to 51 million 
shares a day earlier, thanks to strong buying in most of the second-liners. 
The most active list was topped by PTC vouchers, easy five paisa on 12.445m 
shares, followed by Hub-Power, up 20 paisa on 11.446m, ICI Pakistan, lower 
20 paisa on 10.411m, Dewan Salman, lower 25 paisa on 5m, and Fauji Cement, 
up Rs 1.60 on 3.143m shares.  Other actively traded shares were led by 
PICIC, up 25 paisa on 0.514m, Japan Power, firm 10 paisa on 0.387m, Sui 
Southern, higher Rs 1.75 on 0.694m, and Bank of Punjab, off 75 paisa on 
0.276m shares. There were some other actives also.

There were 420 active scrips, which came in for trading, out of which 234 
shares rose, 119 fell with 67 holding on to the last levels.

DIVIDEND: Engro Chemicals 25% final and 30% interim for the current year, 
Al-Faysal Bank 15%, Brooke Bond Pakistan 35% and Pakistan Cables 15% cash.

Ardeshir Cowasjee 

LAURENCE GOURRET, a Frenchwoman, friend and freelance journalist who I have 
known for quite a while, has been regularly visiting our country over the 
past few years. She contributes articles to various French publications 
(amongst them, Enjeux les Echos, L'Evenement du Jeudi, VSO, Valeurs 
Actuelles) covering for them the different aspects of Pakistan.

Laurence knows the East well, she has travelled to and written on China, 
Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam. This time round, she came to 
Pakistan in the last week of January to cover the end of the various 
election campaigns and the elections themselves. During this and her past 
visits she has met and interviewed many of our unimpressive political lot, 
she has met both the washed and the unwashed. To begin with, she was very 
taken by Benazir Bhutto, by her charisma, her popularity, both here and in 
the West, and that fact that she was the first Muslim woman to be prime 
minister of a Muslim country, so taken that whilst Benazir was in 
opposition from 1990 to 1993, Laurence spent some six months following her 
around Pakistan, interviewing her and her party people, her friends and her 
enemies. She wrote a book on the subject which is shortly to be published 
in France under the title Benazir: La Promesse Trahie (The broken promise).

This time, on her way back to Paris, she spent a few days in Karachi. We 
met, and she told me all about her thoughts on Pakistan, her impressions of 
the recent events and happenings, and about her trip with Nawaz, by 
helicopter from Lahore, to Sarghoda, Khushab and Bhalwal where he addressed 
the awam, exhorting them to vote him in.

I wish I could write as Laurence speaks  fluently, very quickly, with a 
strong French accent, all accompanied by elegant gestures. When I asked her 
what it is that she likes about Pakistan she had no hesitation in saying, 
"I like the country, the people. I feel for the country, I feel for the 
people and I despair for them. The people are poor and one can only think 
that they are deliberately kept ignorant and thus poor. No one has made any 
effort to educate them. The process of education is long, admittedly, but 
not one leader in Pakistan has concentrated on how to go about educating 
all these millions in even a rudimentary manner, let alone concertedly. It 
is ridiculous in such a country to say that the people get the governments 
they deserve. The uneducated are gullible and they trust the promises your 
different politicians make, whether Benazir or Nawaz or Imran or the 
mullahs. All they can hope is that one day some of the promises will be 
kept. They just hope. They can do nothing else. And they multiply like 
rabbits. This is another thing that not one politician seems to be even 
vaguely worried about. Have your politicians never heard about population 
control? It seems not, though at least Benazir should have done so. And 
this in spite of the fact that millions and millions of dollars have come 
in to aid and help the population control programmes. But then we all know 
what happens to that. It is stolen."

*From what she said about Benazir it was clear that Laurence is now highly 
disillusioned and no longer enamoured of her. The more she got to know her, 
the more insufferably arrogant she found her. When arrogance is not 
supported by ability and a track record  or at least by some promise of 
fulfilment  it is a highly negative, even destructive, trait. The people 
that swirl and twirl around Benazir, be they high or low, all behave like 
serfs or servants. They are afraid to question her, to express any opinion 
(not that they are ever asked to), or to show any concern when she 
manifestly does wrong. What exactly are they afraid of?

The West, whose darling she once was, expected a lot from her. She was 
portrayed to the westerners as western educated with western values. She 
was the one who would raise Pakistan from its ashes, bring true democracy 
to its people, and turn it into a flourishing forward-looking nation.

Nawaz, on the other hand, comes out to West and East alike as what he 
actually is. He has no pretensions. He does not maintain that he was born 
to rule. A businessman, he became a leader when chosen to be one by others 
who thought he showed some sort of promise. Circumstances and events have 
put him where he now is. At the present moment, after this last election 
and its amazing result, he rightly feels that he is fit to rule again and 
that this time he can deliver. Unlike Benazir, he has admitted that in his 
first round as prime minister he did make mistakes. But like Benazir he 
staunchly maintains that he and his men did not loot the country, whereas 
we all know that in both cases they did  and with a vengeance.

Of late, it is the PML and not the PPP that is the better organised  the 
PPP is in total disarray whilst the PML under Nawaz's leadership has become 
a well-oiled efficient machine. Laurence was most impressed with the 
orderly swift arrangements and with the unusual punctuality. Nawaz's media 
man in Punjab, Parvaiz Rashid, is highly efficient, low-key and very 
capable. The helicopter, with Nawaz in it, left on time, it arrived at each 
place at the scheduled time, and Nawaz's public meetings were all held at 
the appointed hour. Whilst conversing with Nawaz, Laurence detected an air 
of sincerity in all that he said, whereas trying to have a conversation 
with Benazir is like trying to converse with a running tape-recorder. And 
when Nawaz addresses the electorate, it seems that he has some sort of 
close rapport with them. He laughs and they laugh back, he perhaps tells 
them jokes (Laurence could naturally not understand) and they respond with 
repartees.

I asked her what she felt were his shortcomings. The major one to her mind 
is that he is surrounded by the same people as when he was last in office. 
Some are greedy for power, some for money, and to them all Nawaz is but a 
platform from which they can amass either power or pelf, or preferably 
both. If he is to have any chance of succeeding in what is truly an awesome 
task  putting the country even half right  he will have to shed a lot of 
deadwood and take on some of the new faces he has enrolled.

How do they see Nawaz in France, I asked Laurence. They don't, she said. He 
has an enormous handicap. As soon as you say he is the leader of the Muslim 
League, no one wants to know about him. The word 'Muslim' in the West 
conjures up immediate visions of 'fundamentalists', of the troubles and 
killings and bombings in Algeria and in Egypt and elsewhere, of public 
executions in Saudi Arabia, and of Iranian fatwas issued against authors 
and writers. This coupled with the now exploded myth that Benazir tried to 
spread  "fundamentalism or me"  did not help.

His past is also against him  his first-round failure and his dismissal on 
charges of corruption which most people believe to be true. How is it 
possible that in three years he is a changed man? His business empire has 
been wiped out by Benazir and her men. How will he build it up again? What 
will he have to do to keep his family happy?

So what do you see happening from now on, I asked. Well, she said, as I see 
it, he has one big advantage from which he could take off. The people in 
France, and in other western countries, and of course in Pakistan, now 
recognise Benazir for what she actually truly is  the facade has finally 
been smashed. They realise that her promises were never meant to be kept, 
only broken. It is clear to everyone at this moment in time that Nawaz 
definitely presents the better choice of the two  and there is only one 
viable choice for Pakistan and that is between the two. The people have now 
undoubtedly spoken in his favour.

Laurence liked Nawaz. She was sorry she had not met him before. She was 
struck by his humility, his total lack of self- importance, by his shyness 
and by his manners. She was also struck by his glowing air of cleanliness, 
crisp clothes, shining hair, well manicured nails, fine monogrammed 
handkerchief. He has an air of well-being, of health and good grooming. 
(One thing is for sure, I told her, he is well-fed.) One small 
insignificant gesture that she remarked upon  on their return from the 
helicopter trip Nawaz insisted that she and another woman journalist be 
taken back to their hotel in his own car. Such a thought would not even 
cross Benazir's mind!

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mushtaq Ahmad

SELDOM do elections spring so unsuspected a surprise as the recent polls in 
Pakistan. The landslide victory of Nawaz Sharif has few parallells in the 
countrys history with perhaps the solitary exception of Mujibur Rehmans 
in 1970, which was more in the nature of a referendum than a general 
election.

For a major party which has been the most powerful force in Pakistan 
politics with a leadership of national stature and international 
recognition, to be literally swept off the electoral board, is an unheard 
of phenomena. From 118 the strength of the PPP in the National Assembly has 
dropped to a bare 18, in the punjab from 92 to a minimal 2 and in the 
Frontier from 25 to a meagre 4. And in its own home province, an absolute 
majority of 67 has declined to 36, where it cannot form its government 
unaided by extraneous support of the smaller parties with whom it had never 
looked eye to eye or independents for whose support it had to pay a high 
price.

The rout though not comparable is reminiscent of the fate the Muslim League 
had suffered at the hands of the United Front in 1954 in East Bengal. The 
lowest ebb the PPPs popularity graph has touched, is a cause for serious 
concern not only for the partys future but for the future of democracy 
itself in Pakistan. However unpredictable were the prospects of the two 
party system in the political alignments that had existed prior to the 
polls, in the aftermath of the elections they have become dim if not 
altogether extinct. We have before us the plight of an illassorted 
opposition of less than a dozen members in the Bhutto period. It was a 
misnomer to call it an opposition or even the nucleus of an opposition 
party inside and outside the parliament. Nawaz Sharif is far more 
advantageously placed than was Bhutto to discipline the house to his 
purposes and silence the criticism of the opposition. Whatever its 
composition and complexion it will not be in a position to assert itself as 
the embargo of a shadow government. Its parliamentary plight might well 
force it to take to agitational politics. Past precedents point towards 
such an eventuality. The agitation which had unseated Nawaz Sharif despite 
a favourable court verdict, was organised by no less a person than Benazir 
herself. The promise to refrain from it, is a promise of a politician which 
is a necessity of the present and breaking it might well become a necessity 
of the future. Expediency may dictate a choice which for the sake of 
expediency may not be compelling in the immediacy of the situation.

Nawaz Sharifs greatest asset is his overwhelming majority which will give 
his government an assurance of stability few governments before him have 
enjoyed. It is more impressive than Bhuttos parliamentary backing and 
comes close to the triumphant majority of Sheikh Mujibur Rehman. Nurul Amin 
was the sole survivor from the electoral debacle. Unlike him Benazir is not 
a spent force. She and her party may not be a deterrent to arbitrary 
exercise of state power but with her own record of its exercise, an 
attitude of total resignation to the dictatorship of the majority is 
unthinkable unless the PPP has written off its future in politics.

Although Benazir would not publicly admit it, she knows that she alone was 
responsible for her fall and that it was not brought about by Nawaz Sharif. 
The PPPs defeat at the hands of its own votebank had paved the way for the 
victory of the Muslim League. The polls did not evoke the kind of 
enthusiasm witnessed in the preceding four elections which had recorded a 
heavy turnout. Even if it is 35% according to the latest announcement of 
the Election Commission, it makes a poor showing compared to over 50% in 
the previous polls. Both the parties have lost their ground, exposing the 
weakness of our democracy.

In the West the electoral fortunes of the parties are not influenced so 
much by their own traditional voting pool as by the uncommitted floating 
vote which tilts the balance in favour of one or the other. If the 
political clients cannot bank on their party strength in the electoral 
arena and there is no floating vote on which they can bank between the 
creditworthiness of the parties and their bankruptcy there is a thin line 
of demarcation.

The new prime minister who has received a liability loaded legacy from his 
predecessor, cannot rest on his laurels and hope that all will be well. The 
economy has not turned the corner and will not be out of the wood by the 
turn of the screw. It will have to be extricated out of the morass of 
deprivation and dependency by a frontal assault on the citadel of the 
deeply entrenched interests that have precipitated its fall. Manifestos of 
the political parties, including that of the triumphant Muslim League, had 
not analysed the causes of the economic malaise and suggested the remedies 
for its cure. Couched in vague and ambiguous generalities, promising 
everything to every body, affluent and the indigent alike, the party 
programmes held out no promise of fulfilment. The emptiness of these 
promises was largely to blame for a decline in popularity.

The PPP of Benazir is not a replica of the party founded by her political 
father, nor can the Muslim League of Nawaz Sharif trace its parentage to 
the organisation led by the Father of the Nation. The Quaids League had a 
great ideal to achieve. The Nawaz League was born long after its 
achievement and the subsequent demise of the organisation that brought the 
new state into existence. The PML(N) in glaring contrast was a product of 
the struggle for power that had ensued in the post-Zia period. Its appeal 
still lacks the all pervasive character of the Muslim League, deriving as 
it does its strength from the largest province which is its stronghold, 
while in the smaller provinces it has not generated the same measure of 
response, where it is more of an outgrowth than an offshoot of its foster 
parent.

Nawaz Sharifs stewardship of the Punjab is undisputed, while in the rest 
of the provinces, his claim to national leadership is conditioned by 
compromises and concessions. The question marks to its unity will become 
more pronounced after the governments at the Centre and in the provinces 
are formed and start functioning. Even the League-led coalitions in the 
provinces will be no guarantee of a trouble and tension-free Centre-
provincial relationship Nawaz Sharifs own tenure as the Chief Minister of 
the Punjab was characterised by an exercise of provincial authority that 
had exceeded the bounds of autonomy to the point of defiance of the centre.

In the political spectrum that has now emerged relations between Islamabad, 
Karachi and Peshawar are certain to be under a severe strain. The MQM and 
the ANP have their own commitments to their provincial constituencies which 
have remained safe and unaffected by the wind of change. They are not 
likely to toe the central line when it comes to honouring their pledge to 
the electorate. A bridge between rural and urban Sindh is easier planned 
than built. The bitterness of the past has made it almost unbridgeable. 
Power sharing though essential cannot by itself be a guarantee of 
coexistence.

The Muslim League even with its improved performance in the elections, 
cannot speak on behalf of the interior of which the PPP is more 
representative than any other party represented in the Assembly. An accord 
between the PPP and the MQM alone can pave the way towards an 
understanding. It is doubtful if the two will come together to build a 
society on mutual trust and goodwill in the larger interest of the province 
and the country. Without it, peace and tranquillity will not return to a 
benighted land. An improvised legislative majority is not a solution. It is 
a key that can unlock the door to the repetition of an unhappy past on 
which the country must turn its back.

Sindh is not the only problem province, the problem in Balochistan too does 
not admit of an easy solution. It will call for a continuous adjustment of 
differences if experience in the past is an index to the future. The Bhutto 
period was a period of turbulence which had witnessed an outbreak of 
insurgency following a refusal by Islamabad to accept its demands of 
autonomy and followed by the imposition of an emergency and military 
intervention. Attaullah Mengal was the chief minister of the province then 
and has now once again emerged as the leading political personality of the 
province and the BNP, the largest single party which can be a rallying 
ground for a more viable coalition. Economically neglected and politically 
alienated its development will warrant for an ever increasing flow of 
financial assistance and the aspirations of the people a far greater 
devolution of power.

The sailing in the Frontier will not be smooth either. The Awami National 
Party, national in name and Awami in a restricted sense, has never been a 
part of the mainstream of politics. Even its alliance with Muslim League of 
Nawaz Sharif will not bring it out of its provincial isolation. Though the 
largest party, the Muslim League is not large enough to form a government 
on the strength of its following. Differences with ANP sunk in the 
opposition are bound to erupt in the government. A marriage of convenience, 
it will be an uneasy coalition. uneasy a strong province with a new 
nomenclature and a weak Centre with limited powers has been a constant 
refrain of its programme for which it will press more vehemently, now that 
it will have an almost equal share in the governance of the province. 
Whether the party has shed its historical animosity to the Muslim League of 
yore, its role as a partner in the government will soon reveal.

In politics too adversity makes strange bedfellows. In Pakistan we find 
them both in the government as well as in the opposition. Even if the polls 
were entirely free from the baneful influences of the past the results 
would not have given the nation the government it deserved.

<a name="lear">Learning from the past</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Maqbool Ahmad Bhatty

THE concluding days of Ramazan brought us the divine gift of the Quran, and 
in our lifetime the gift of Pakistan in 1947. The results of the February 3 
election this year can also be seen as a divine dispensation to put 
democracy back on the rails in Pakistan, with one party, which claims the 
mantle of the founding fathers, holding the kind of majority that liberates 
it from the constraints faced by hung parliaments over the past decade.

Mr Nawaz Sharif, who will be assuming power as prime minister, will not 
only have unprecedented support from the elected representatives since the 
early days of Pakistan, but will also have an equally unprecedented host of 
problems to address. He has secured this mandate from a people whose 
despondency over worsening standards of governance was approaching despair, 
with the economy teetering over the edge of insolvency, while forces of 
lawlessness and violence appeared to be triumphing over those of law and 
order.

The up and coming leader has acted in a manner that combines humility with 
a realistic awareness of the dimensions of the challenges ahead. He has 
begun by going to the holy places of our faith to seek God's blessings and 
guidance. His preliminary remarks to interviewers reveal a welcome desire 
to eschew the politics of confrontation and revenge, and to seek national 
consensus in solving the problems that plague nearly every facet of our 
national life. He was also reported to have said that he wants to bury the 
past and look to the future.

Even though this may have been a figure of speech, designed to emphasise a 
forward-looking attitude, the writer respectfully urges the desirability of 
keeping the recent past very much in mind, to avoid making the mistakes 
that were made not only by his predecessor but by his own administration 
not so long ago.

George Santayana is credited with the statement that "those who do not 
learn from history are condemned to repeating it." The writer was one of a 
group of six persons who had "been privileged to serve Pakistan in 
responsible positions" who had addressed an "open letter" to the Prime 
minister in October 1995, at a time she appeared to be considering action 
to deal with corruption and inefficiency by appointing a Police Commission. 
The letter pointed out the need for a much wider set of actions to arrest 
the decay in the operation of the principal state institutions. Drawing 
attention to doubts being raised by foreign experts, whether Pakistan would 
survive into the next century, the letter had urged the elected leader of 
the country to adopt the path of conciliation and dialogue with political 
opponents, to end the Politicisation of public services to prevent 
corruption and inefficiency, and to appoint a Presidential Commission to 
examine the host of problems affecting good governance.

Though the "open letter" drew a positive public response, the government of 
the day took umbrage and a campaign to defame its writers at the personal 
level was started. All of them were accused of having skeletons in their 
cupboards, and were even alleged to be "stoking the fires" with "job 
applications" in hand. Perhaps there was a divine purpose in the then prime 
minister persisting in her flawed policies, for the president, who belonged 
to her own party, ultimately felt compelled, a year or so later, to 
exercise the discretionary powers given to him by the Constitution by 
dismissing her. This has facilitated the powerful mandate that Mr Nawaz 
Sharif has received from a people who passionately want their country to 
survive and succeed.

Mr Nawaz Sharif is already being flooded with advice and admonitions. There 
will be no dearth of ideas, and of sound recommendations, notably from the 
task forces appointed by the caretakers to focus on key sectors of the 
economy. The writer seeks to make some specific points that have figured in 
agonising discussions within groups of well-wishers of the country who feel 
deeply concerned that many international analysts continue to regard 
Pakistan as a likely candidate for becoming another "failed state."

A "failed state" is manifestly one that has been unable to maintain the 
machinery of administration, through economic collapse and lack of 
political cohesion. We have the examples of Somalia and Rwanda, with 
Afghanistan hopefully set to emerge from a state of near anarchy brought on 
by factional rivalries and infighting, either through the victory of the 
Taliban or a UN backed effort to promote a compromise among the various 
ethnic groups. The reasons that lead foreign observers to conclude that 
Pakistan might follow down the road to oblivion are the following:

i) Our management of the economy, or rather the lack of it is such that we 
are neither able to pay our way abroad, with adverse balances of trade and 
payments, nor at home, where our budgetary deficit persists at levels that 
oblige us to subsist on the basis of heavy borrowing and deficit financing;

ii) Our political system has been dominated by confrontation and 
polarisation, without the tolerance or accommodation basic to a democratic 
system.

iii) Political tampering with the government apparatus, and the weakening 
of institutions have increased corruption and inefficiency to a point where 
the majority of the people are losing faith in it.

The rising incidence of crime and violence is rooted partly in economic 
distress and partly in ethnic and sectarian tensions some of which are 
exploited by interested foreign powers. The "culture of heroin and 
kalashnikov" which was a by-product of the Afghanistan crisis is also a 
factor which has never been tackled effectively owing to corruption or 
collusion in high places.

Learning from the past is particularly apropos for Mr Nawaz Sharif with 
regard to his own first term as prime minister that saw failures which 
neither he nor the country can afford to repeat:

i) His government had decided to set up a Committee on Administrative 
Reforms, under the chairmanship of the then minister Hamid Nasir Chattha. 
One of its recommendations, which was approved by the Cabinet, was to 
enforce the merit principle in recruitment to many sensitive non-gazetted 
posts by entrusting it to the Federal Public Service Commission. The 
writer, who was then a member of the Commission, was charged with the 
drawing up of plans to implement that decision, but at the last moment, the 
elected representatives, including the provincial chief ministers, 
prevailed upon the leadership to resile from that decision, as they wanted 
to retain political patronage for appointments to such "lucrative" posts as 
income-tax inspectors, customs inspectors, etc. The enforcement of the 
merit principle in all recruitment to government posts must now be given 
high priority, both to improve the quality of administration, and to 
control corruption.

ii) Another failure that had remained common to successive administrations 
was in terms of inability to collect adequate revenues, which resulted in 
deficits on the one hand, and in an unfair apportionment of the tax burden, 
which tended to fall on the poorer segments of the population. Mr Nawaz 
Sharif will find that the reduction of the deficit not only requires a 
drastic reorganisation of the tax collecting machinery, but also effective 
taxation of the agricultural sector, as well as a quantum increase in the 
number of taxpayers. Perhaps lower taxes, collected more honestly, will be 
the answer.

iii) Owing to rise in living costs, and high inflation, the rate of savings 
in the country has tended to fall. Measures to raise the savings rate would 
involve simpler living, lower inflation, and higher inducements. The 
savings rate in China and Japan exceeds 30% whereas it has been less than 
half that in Pakistan. Mr Nawaz Sharif had initiated a drive for simple 
living in his first term, with a highly publicised call for wedding feasts 
to be limited to one dish. At the same time, this call lacked credibility 
when he and some of the chief ministers went for the purchase of expensive 
luxury aircraft for official use. Austerity, and simple living become 
acceptable when the example is set at the highest level.

As the prime minister-elect has stated, and as his countrymen have 
observed, he has learnt a great deal during the years out of power. The 
Almighty has chosen to bestow on him the kind of mandate that even he had 
not expected. Let us hope and pray that as he embarks on a term that will 
hopefully continue into the next century, he will be blessed with the 
statesmanship, the wisdom, and the ability to learn from the past that will 
lift his nation of 140 million to a place of honour and dignity among the 
international community.

Ghani Eirabi

CONTEMPORARY analyses seem to be overlooking the main cause of the collapse 
of the People's Party: it is not an impulsive reaction; and it is not so 
much the taint of political corruption,  which was damaging enough  as 
the erosion of its economic pretensions that has triggered such massive 
disillusionment.

Those blaming it on ethnic reassertion, Punjabi chauvinism or Pakhtoon 
pride, appear to forget that ethnicity is not a new phenomenon; it was 
there even before the new state came into being. In 1946-47 ethnic 
separatism was superseded by the Indian Muslims' bid for self-preservation; 
and in 1969-70 by the Pakistan masses' resolve to retrieve themselves from 
poverty. To them "roti, kapra and makan" was not an empty slogan but a 
solemn commitment by a group of politicians they had come to trust.

That the longing for the much-needed economic relief swept aside every 
other consideration including ethnic parochialism is shown by the 
overwhelming support the PPP won in Punjab  in fact, Mr Zulfikar Ali 
Bhutto enjoyed in numbers and loyalty, greater backing in Punjab than even 
in Sindh. The common people of Punjab and the NWFP rallied to the People's 
Party's support not once, but several times; and they continued to exhibit 
the same devotion to his daughter Benazir Bhutto for the same reasons.

What has brought about a change has been explained by the PPP's founder-
ideologue Sheikh Mohammad Rashid who, in a recent statement in Lahore, put 
the blame squarely on the PPP's betrayal of the solemn economic commitments 
made to the teeming masses of Pakistan. From the role of a rebel against 
the status quo, the PPP relapsed into the position of protector of the 
Wadera privilege. Once it lost that high moral ground, its other ugly scars 
such as political corruption became more visible and less acceptable.

This is not to suggest by any means, that sickening accounts of all-
pervasive corruption did no damage  the lurid descriptions of Asif Ali 
Zardari's wrong-doing undoubtedly took a heavy toll  but just to make the 
point that it was not redeemed by any ideological sympathy between the 
ruler and the ruled. The people, increasingly nauseated by governmental 
corruption or the high-handedness of the party functionaries were not 
assuaged by any economic relief. Not only were the people denied the 
"bonanza" they had been promised, they were hard-hit by shrinkage of 
economic opportunities and sky-rocketing inflation. The party workers also 
became victims of discrimination within the party  between those who 
enjoyed all the patronage and prospered and those who were left high and 
dry, exploited by the party's own power brokers.

Under Benazir, the People's Party moved away from its original role of 
mobilising a revolt against economic status quo and instead assumed the new 
role of protector of the privileged and the powerful, representing not only 
the feudal aristocracy and the government-patronised entrepreneurs, but 
even shifty operators of PPP-dominated trade unions which exacted a heavy 
fee from the poor workers for fixing them in job. PPP trade union leaders 
helped themselves to such lavish facilities as transport fleets and huge 
kick-backs in the Karachi Steel Mill, the United Bank network, and the 
Karachi Port Trust. Those who had sneaked into popular acceptance as 
champions of drive against exploiters and racketeers had themselves become 
exploiters and racketeers. And that verily marked the beginning of the end.

That the electoral upheaval of February 3 was a genuine revolt of the 
victims  a proclamation of electoral maturity  is becoming increasingly 
clear, as more and more details come in from the erstwhile PPP strongholds. 
Contrary to original reports that PPP workers signalled their disgust just 
by staying away from the polls, fresh information suggests that at a number 
of places, the erstwhile party faithfuls showed their resentment by 
actually voting against the "party waderas."

Not only PPP voters but the Pakistan electorate as a whole appears to have 
begun to move against "vested interests" as a whole, be they economic, 
religious or sectarian. It has revolted against hypocrisy and denounced 
horse-trading and defection. It has drastically curtailed the 
representation of religious orthodoxy from seven MNAs to two. It has thrown 
out Maulana Fazalur Rahman, inflicted the first ever defeat on Mustafa Khar 
and repudiated Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan and the NWFP has taken care to 
defeat every single turn-coat. The people are so angry against corruption 
that Benazir Bhutto had to keep Asif Ali Zardari out of the polls and many 
of the PPP cabinet ministers suspected of corruption have lost their seats.

Again, the people who have long favoured popular polls as a means of 
democratic assertion this year for the first time flashed the clear message 
that much as they liked elections, they prefer "Ehtesab" first to clean the 
Augean stables; and they loudly proclaimed their aversion to what they 
dubbed as the "same ugly faces." And they kept out as many "ugly" faces as 
they could.  This represents a sea change in the stance of the electorate, 
which, from all appearance, seems to demand henceforth evidence of greater 
moral integrity on part of their chosen representatives, less hypocrisy, 
cleaner administration and more importance given to the amelioration of 
their economic condition  which is understandably considering the 
benumbing privation the common folk have undergone  smack in the midst of 
vulgar display of unearned opulence.

This should leave nobody in any doubt that accelerated urbanisation, that 
is the rapid shifting of population from the rural to urban areas, is 
beginning to move the overall balance of power from the landed interests to 
the urban lower middle class, which comparatively speaking has awareness 
enough, guts enough and mobilising skill enough to have itself heard.

No ruling party, no matter what its political complexion, can hope to rule 
long and well without taking cognisance of these fundamental changes in the 
attitude of the electorate. The new government will have to recognise the 
fact that the people will no more be satisfied with empty slogans and they 
will not tolerate economic injustice any more. They insist that 
opportunities for gainful employment be provided forthwith and runaway 
consumer prices be controlled even faster.

The people's nerves are on an edge and any further increase in economic 
hardship at this stage could trigger more trouble than any of us has 
bargained for. To convince the people of the need for fiscal discipline, 
there will have to be a comparable measure of economic self-restraint not 
only on the part of the government but also the wealthy elite whose 
ostentatious living is a grade provocation. Instead of misleading the 
people with any show-off projects like the yellow cabs scheme, the 
government should be launching short-gestation honest-to-God economically 
viable projects urgently and mobilising the propel in a common endeavour to 
increase production  to begin with, farm-production reminiscent of the 
British "Grow more food campaign" during World War II, followed by enhanced 
industrial output, both by disciplining the wayward labour by imposing 
financial restraints and by rehabilitating the industrial plant. 
Irrespective of what the semi-literate religious leaders preach, Zakat 
money should be utilised to sponsor an elaborate chain across the country 
of cottage industries to absorb able bodies self-respecting men and women. 
An economic relief package is an immediate necessity.

However, no benefit of a policy or project, no matter how well conceived or 
operated, will reach the common man unless the administrative machinery is 
drastically overhauled without delay. There ought to be visible tightening 
of discipline and operative revitalisation of at least three sectors to 
begin with  namely the operation controlled by the D.C., the S.P. and the 
Tehsildar. No quarter should be given to any functionary, SHO or patwari, 
found slack or corrupt. The point is that it is immediate provision of 
economic relief and immediate improvement in the law and order situation, 
ensuring security of life, honour and property  at the grassroots level  
rather than any manner of high-level political manoeuvring or pseudo-
intellectual debate on the Eighth Amendment or CDNS that is going to 
determine not only the future of parliamentary democracy and the Pakistan 
Muslim League but of Pakistan itself.

<a name="fall">Fall-out of polls sweep on sports set-up</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

THE landslide victory of Pakistan Muslim League, headed by Mr Nawaz Sharif, 
in the national elections has stunned foreign and home observers and has 
led to many speculations. It is beyond doubt that changes will come in many 
fields. Even sporting disciplines will not remain untouched and various 
organisations will go through the process of accountability and perhaps axe 
may fall on their top officialdom.

One can easily assume that there may not be any possibility of a 
reshuffling in the setup of football, now that Mian Mohammad Azhar, 
President of the games federation, has won a National Assembly seat from 
Punjab with a thumping majority. Soccer is an Olympic event but it is 
controlled internationally by FIFA, headquartered in Zurich. The Asian 
Football Confederation, FIFAs regional body, has full sway over the game 
in the whole continent and is responsible for its development. Any dispute 
or controversy is taken note of both by the parent organisation as well as 
its Bangkok-based affiliate. When two parallel bodies started working in 
Pakistan it was a violation of FIFA charter and AFC had to intervene on the 
directive of the international federation. New elections were held under 
the supervision of AFC. Thus the central setup of the game cannot be 
disturbed.

With Mian Azhar, an important figure in his party, at the helm of soccer 
affairs in the country one can expect considerable push to the game. It is 
possible his presence may lead to the necessary upliftment of the game in 
the provinces as well. If `the poor mans sport has gone down the hill in 
Sindh with two groups challenging each other and activities having declined 
Mian Azhar may step in to either order fresh elections or help end the 
bickerings in the interest of the game. Football activities have to 
increase in cubits; the tiffs have to be thrown to the lumber-room. Though 
a mild-mannered and refined person, Mian Azhar, former Governor of Punjab, 
can toe a tough line to set the soccer house of Sindh in order and even 
bring in new corps of honest, efficient and more practical people to give 
boost to the game and stage as many tournaments as possible to enhance the 
standards, which have soared in countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, 
Iraq and Syria  the Arab countries, having minimal level and 
infrastructure a few years ago.

In athletics, the major discipline in Olympics, the Asian Games and SAF 
Championship Sindh betrays a sad scenario with two rival factions trying to 
get the better of the other in politics rather than in track activities. 
The one recognised by the  national Olympic association and the athletic 
federation came forward to stage the annual programme of track and field in 
Larkana, even though the facilities there for such a big venture were 
available in the smallest degree. The other group practically did nothing 
for athletics in the province or the mega-city of Karachi with tartan 
surface laid for the specific purpose of sprints and jumps. One expects the 
incoming government to advise the two factions to close their ranks and 
work jointly for the cause of athletics. Already there is talk of the 
shifting of the National Games, allotted to Sindh, to the Frontier. Karachi 
can take on the responsibility of holding the games provided the tussles 
among the warring groups come to an end. 

Will there be change in the hierarchy of hockey federation? Traditionally 
the top slot goes to the head of the national carrier. Was the appointment 
of the present incumbent of PIA chief a political one? He had been a 
regular employee of the airlines and rose to the highest post on the basis 
of efficiency and merit. For over three years AVM Farooq Umar held the dual 
charge of PIA head and president of the hockey organisation. In those days 
when hockey plunged to its lowest depth, Nawaz Tiwana was having his 
odyssey in the Defence Ministry or the Port Qasim Authority. Once Tiwana 
staged a comeback to PIA, the Aitchesonian colour-holder could not but have 
taken over the onerous functions of hockey. There was devolution of 
executive, training and selectorial work. The arduous camp drills and fair 
selection with an amalgam of youth and experience paid the dividends and in 
the first major test in the Champions Trophy at Madras Pakistan climbed the 
podium as the runnersup. The rules had been modified and yet the selected 
set rose to the occasion, exhibiting their fighting qualities and 
sustaining spirit. With so much progress in hockey the technocrats rule out 
any possibility of a change in the games administrative makeup. If the 
transfer from the Port Qasim Authority to PIA would have been the result of 
political manoeuvrings the caretaker government would certainly have 
reversed the arrangement. It was a purely executive decision made by the 
previous government in the first quarter of last year and perhaps the 
arrangement may not be disturbed to let hockey make further headway 
internationally and domestically. A hard test comes next month when a 
multinational tournament is set to be held in the country. 

Cricket has its own constitution, its rules and regulations. The choice of 
the higher functionaries is the discretion of the President, who under the 
constitution is the Patron of the Board. Now that the elections have 
altered the whole political complexion of the country, will the President 
think of changing guards at the top level of cricket?. The games 
organisers rule out the possibility. They say the Chariman, the Chief 
Executive and Treasurer have a tenure of three years under clauses 5,6 and  
7 of the board constitution. However, the officials may hold the posts 
subject to the pleasure of the Patron. 

On the contrary, some observers feel that if nominations were made on the 
basis of party alignment the incoming government, with a different 
political shade, may request the President (the Patron of the board) to 
install new administrators, to run the affairs of cricket. Both the 
Chairman, Syed Zulfiqar Shah Bukhari, and the Treasurer, Salman Taseer, are 
avowed Peoples Party men. In fact the latter lost election to a National 
Assembly seat from Punjab by over 35,000 votes. Will they be able to retain 
their cricket posts, ask some followers of the game? Yes, say the 
constitutionalists, who feel that cricket is not politics. Why should the 
Patron make changes in the setup? Others point to previous new appointments 
in the board following governmental ousters as Dr Nasim Hasan Shah and 
Shahid Rafi had to make way for an Adhoc committee after the PPP took the 
reins of the government. Arif Ali Abbasi stayed as Chief Executive of the 
board for just 10 months (not three years) to later give charge to renowned 
cricketer Majid Khan who came over from the Pakistan Television leaving 
temporarily its sports directorship. It is possible the Patron on his own 
or at the request of the Prime Minister may bring new faces considering 
that previously too he was ringing changes in the boards administrative 
setup, whatever the constitution clauses may say.

It is also possible that now that the Pakistan Muslim League (N) has won a 
massive democratic mandate the constitution of the board may go through a 
drastic modification and a democratic process may be adopted for installing 
top executives, as is the mode in some other cricket-playing countries. 
Anyway it is for the Patron to take the initial step in the switch to the 
democratisation of PCB.

<a name="noof">No off-side rule to rob hockey of artistic touch</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Alauddin Ghauri

Hockey, the favourite game of the spectators, has in the recent past been 
subjected to so much of experimentation and changes that it has confused 
its fans and lost quite a bit of its charm. The changes in the rules, 
carried out by the FIH are likely to do more harm than good to the 
indigenous style. Brig Atif, Chairman, Rules Board, in an interview 
telecast by PTV and partly reported in the press a few days back, has tried 
to justify and uphold the change in the off side rule. It has been 
claimed that the off side rule was an impediment in making the game more 
thrilling and scoring field goals. He disagrees with the contention that 
the new no off side rule, would be detrimental to the sub-continental 
style of hockey.

The change in playing conditions and rules are generally brought in to make 
the game more attractive provided all equally benefit from the change. The 
Rules Board needs to be complimented for introducing certain changes to 
save time and to build tempo of the game. However, no off side rule 
recently introduced has totally destroyed the advantages that had accrued 
from the above changes. The artistic game of hockey would now be turned 
into hit and run and aerial approach. The delightful and eye-catching 
dribbling and dodging would lose their importance and be replaced by brute 
force.

Artistic and attractive demonstration by the players at various positions 
was encouraged and they initiated their moves from the centre line. The 
contestants, due to non-existent no mans land, had to plan the moves from 
the very beginning. Forwards had to ensure, by speedy movements and quick 
thinking that they did not fall into the off side trap laid by the 
defenders. Wingers speed and ability to send fast and accurate crosses 
were effectively exploited. 

Centre half acted as the pivot and Anwar Ahmed Khan in that role was 
adjudged as the best of his time. Noor Alams cross in the Rome final in 
1960 enabled late Naseer Bunda to score to win the goal. Thereafter, Khalid 
Mahmood and Samiullah dominated the scene as wingers. 

The Rules Board changed the off side rule upto 25 yards. The inner trio 
managed to play quite a pleasing game. However, the wingers lost some of 
their effectiveness for the reason that the policy of passing the ball to 
them in line with the corner flag was abandoned for fear of being off side. 
Now that the rule has altogether been done away with, pivotal role of the 
centre half has been substituted with a sweeper.

It may not be fair to suggest that the chairman of the Rules Board, does 
not appreciate the significance of the no mans land. It must, however, 
be realised that the larger the area of no mans land, the more difficult 
it becomes to dominate and go through to score. Offence normally succeeds 
in the situation where no mans land does not exist. In hockey, for this 
reason offence is considered as the best form of defence, which makes the 
game thrilling. The Rules Board un-wittingly appears to have given undue 
advantage to those who believe and indulge in packed defence which can deny 
approach to the sensitive area of defenders.

The defenders by a hard and forceful hit or scoope to their well placed 
players in the opponents area, can pose a serious threat against run of 
play. Results achieved through such means and methods can never bring the 
game closer to spectators.

<a name="thre">Three more probables join hockey camp</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Feb. 18: The National hockey camp has been complemented by another 
three probables on the second day of training at the Hockey Club of 
Pakistan (HCP) Stadium here on Tuesday.

So far, the strength of the camp has risen to 42 probables from the lot of 
47 selectees. Pakistans star inside-left Mohammad Shahbaz Junior, who was 
affected with vision problems during the last National camp because of a 
lacerated vessel behind the right eye and then forced to skip last 
Decembers Champions Trophy World Hockey Tournament staged at Madras 
(India), has reached full fitness.

The stylish Olympian inside-left, who has long suffered the indignity of 
being compelled to stay in the shadow of former Pakistan Captain Shahbaz 
Ahmed told `Dawn that he has been given a clean bill of health by his 
doctors. Im rearing to get into the fray and after the camp training, I 
should be playing upto my full potential, added the dashing Mohammad 
Shahbaz, who has now been provided the godsend opportunity to make the 
inside-left position all his own.

Olympian utility midfielder Irfan Mahmood has also joined the camp and 
similarly goalkeeper Ashfaq of Sargodha. Right winger Ejaz Ahmad, inside-
left Aleem Raza and left half Waheed Shahid have sent medical certificates 
to the PHF to ensure their leave of absence.  However, there is no news 
about the whereabouts of Wahs goalkeeper Ghulam Abbas, son of Zakir 
Hussain, the 1968 Mexico Olympics gold medal winning team custodian.

In a strange twist where the picking of the camp probables are concerned, 
yet another son of a former National star has been called up for camp 
training to join Kamran Ashraf, son of former international and 
international umpire Chaudhry Mohammad Ashraf. He is Moazzam Saeed, son of 
the great Olympian right half Saeed Anwar. And to add to this is the 
inclusion of right back Ziauddin, son of freelance journalist Baziz Khan. 
Ziauddin appears to be in an age group where there is hardly any room for 
improvement.

<a name="asif">Asif steers Pakistan to win over Bangladesh</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

DHAKA, Feb. 19: A captains knock of 67 in 105 balls by Asif Mujtaba 
steered favourites Pakistan `A to an easy 6-wicket victory against host 
Bangladesh in the opening match of the 3rd SAARC Cricket Tournament here 
today (Wednesday).

The Pakistan skipper hit seven boundaries and a sixer as he shared 98 runs 
with Mohammad Wasim for the second wicket. This enabled Pakistan A to 
overhaul the hosts total making 186 for 4 in 39 overs before a capacity 
crowd at the Dhaka National Stadium.

Mujtaba, who earned the Man of the Match award, joined Wasim in the eighth 
over when paceman Saiful got rid of opener Akhtar Sarfaraz (18) with 
Pakistan A managing 41 runs for two wickets.

Winning the toss, skipper Asif Mujtaba put Bangladesh to bat first and 
restricted them at 182 runs for 9 wickets in allotted 50 overs as the top 
order batsmen of the host nation failed to rise to the occasion.

<a name="draw">Draws taken out for Davis Cup matches</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD,  Feb. 19: The draws ceremony for the first round tie  of Asia-
Oceania Davis Cup Group-II match between Pakistan and Iran will be held at 
10.00 in the morning on Thursday at a local hotel.

The  Feb. 21-23  round  will get under-way at  the  newly-built Pakistan  
Tennis Complex clay courts with opening  singles  being contested  on  
Friday at 1000 a.m. The doubles will  be  competed  on Saturday  at  1200 
noon while the reverse singles will be  played  on Sunday at 1000 hrs.

International  Tennis Federation referee Fabrrice Chouquet  on Wednesday  
expressed his satisfaction over the condition  of  the new  courts.  It is 
a new complex, something  which  will  serve greatly  in the future events 
to be held in Islamabad.  Yes,  Im satisfied  with the work being done and 
the courts will be  ready for Davis Cup games on Friday, the ITF gold 
badge official  said. Chouquet on Wednesday morning held captains meeting 
involving the  two teams and informed them about the new set of rules  etc. 
Later,  in  the evening the ITF referee held a meeting  with  the chair  
umpire Arif Qureshi, Pakistans only white badge  referee, and  the  lines  
men. The neutral  chair  umpire  from  Malaysia, nominated by ITF, will be 
arriving here on Thursday, it was learnt.

There  is  only one change in the nomination  of  captain  and players by 
ITF. It was stated that up to 10 days prior to the tie a nation may change 
its team nominations one or more times. After the  10-day limit, two 
nominations may be changed up to one  hour before the draw. Earlier only 
one change was allowed. However, it was highly unlikely that in case of 
both hosts and Iran this  new rule  will  be utilised as Iran has already 
brought  a  three-man team after the fourth member Ruhullah Akbari fell ill 
and there is no question of any change in the Pakistan side selected on 
league  basis competition.
