Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 4: Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto has said though 
election results have been engineered, she will give a chance to Nawaz 
Sharif to complete his tenure.
    
If I launch a movement (against the government for rigging the elections) 
it will only result in the dismissal of another assembly. What will people 
get? Bhutto told an over-crowded news conference in the Federal Capital on 
Tuesday after her arrival from Larkana.
    
Where do we go from here? Neither the people of Pakistan, the nation, the 
PPP or I can afford another election physically or politically, the former 
prime minister whose party has won only 17 seats in the 217-member National 
Assembly said.
    
The PPP has been routed completely from three out of four provinces in the 
general elections.
    
As far as I am concerned, I derive a quiet satisfaction from the failure 
of President Leghari to form a Kings Party, to have a hung parliament and 
to impose a presidential system, the former prime minister said.
    
For better or worse, Nawaz Sharif and the PML have been given charge of 
this country. They have been in effect been given a blank cheque to re-
write the Constitution, Ms Bhutto said. I wish Mian Nawaz Sharif good 
luck.
    
The former prime minister said she wanted to break the vicious circle where 
the assembly is not given a chance to complete its tenure.
    
She said though the election results were engineered, she would like to see 
democracy strengthen its roots in the country. I want to see parliamentary 
democracy to flourish, she added.

Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 3: The Election Commission announced the first result at 
12:45 AM, a record of sorts because in the previous elections the first 
results had begun coming in within six hours of polling.
    
Every time the Election Commission was approached by reporters for results 
the stock answer was: Wait for some more time. The officials of the 
Commission also said that since the results of the provincial assemblies 
were also being compiled, so the delay.
    
It was also for the first time that the reporters were debarred from 
entering into the Control Room of the Election Commission and were asked 
to sit on the second floor of the ministry of state and frontier region 
raising questions about the transparency of the election process.
    
President Farooq Leghari visited the Election Commission at about nine 
Oclock and inspected various arrangements made for announcing the results 
and expressed his satisfaction over it. The reporters were not even allowed 
to move around with the President in the Commission which too was some 
thing totally unexpected and unprecedented.
    
The staff on duty in the Commission was also hostile to media and did not 
permit any one to even come near the control room. On being questioned, 
they were told to remain away from the control room and wait for the 
results of the election on the television.
    
Interestingly the delay in announcing the consolidated results occurred 
despite the fact that the Election Commission had made arrangements to 
announce the results of the elections of each polling station on the spot.
    
Everyone expected that the results would start coming after 9.30 because of 
the low turn out. In all previous elections, at least unofficial results 
started coming by 10 pm.
    
No plausible explanation was offered either by the Election Commission or 
any responsible official of the caretaker government as to why newsmen were 
not allowed to have access to the control room which at time looked more of 
an office of any security agency than the office which was responsible to 
facilitate the media.

Nizamuddin Siddiqui

KARACHI, Feb 2: Mondays parliamentary elections do not seem very different 
from the previous elections of the country. Like so many past elections, 
this one, too, is being held under a caretaker government, the elected 
government having been dismissed by the president. There is, therefore, a 
lot of chaos and bitterness in the air.
    
There is, however, one thing which sets Mondays elections apart from the 
previous ones, thanks largely to television advertisements by the 
contending parties to disseminate their messages.
    
Not all the political parties have used the TV ads to spread their 
messages. But the four which have done so, have shown a lot of gusto and 
imagination in propagating their image.
    
The enthusiasm of the four parties for the television ads can be gauged 
from their performance on Saturday night alone. They paid Rs 3.72 million 
to buy 42 minutes and 15 seconds, or 14.08 per cent, of prime time (from 
7:20pm to 12:20am). With the adverts of them  Pakistan Peoples Party 
(PPP), Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), Tehrik-i-Insaf, and Tehrik-i-Jafria 
 dominating the total time slated for advertisements, very few commercial 
ads were aired.
    
During the period mentioned, 25 political messages were aired by the PTV in 
all. In other words, on an average, a political ad was aired after every 12 
minutes.
    
Almost all the adverts were based on personalities rather than on issues 
with all the four parties showing their party leaders extensively. Only one 
ad from the PPP and one from the PML(N) spoke of economic issues.
    
One PPP message showed Nusrat Bhutto endorsing the policies of her 
daughter, Benazir Bhutto. The short TIP message showed Imran Khan appealing 
to the voters to go to the polling stations on their own, since, he 
claimed, his party lacked resources to provide conveyance to the voters. 
The TIPs 25-minute infomercial that was aired on Saturday night was 
actually the rerun of the PTV programme called Election Hour.

<a name="usse">US sends signal to Pakistan politicians</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai 

WASHINGTON, Jan 31: The US has sent a clear message to politicians in 
Pakistan that if they did not put their act together, Washington would be 
willing to work comfortably with the army, even under a barely concealed 
military regime, analysts said on Friday.
    
Reviewing the latest US human rights report on Pakistan, they said it 
recognised that the  troika governs Pakistan, that it stated 
categorically that the judiciary was not independent, it blasted 
politicians for their acts of commission and omission and, between the 
lines, expressed satisfaction that the Benazir government had been 
dismissed.
    
It is just good luck that the judgement in the Benazir Bhutto case came 
before this report. Had it been delayed and this report had appeared before 
the judgement, Benazir and the Supreme Court would have been put in a 
difficult situation as many conclusions drawn in the report had a direct 
bearing on the Benazir case, a diplomat said.
    
The report conveys strong political opinions of the US administration about 
Pakistans domestic affairs and in view of the importance Robin Raphel gave 
to the army chief while ignoring the prime minister during her recent 
visit, it should become clear that the state department is no longer hooked 
to a strong commitment for democratic rule in Pakistan, analysts say.
    
The troika was mentioned in the human rights report for 1995 as well and 
although it is a reality in Pakistan, the analysts are still questioning 
whether an official government document could recognise it as such without 
kicking off a diplomatic row. No such row started last year and none is 
expected this year.
    
The US policy is evident, the analysts say, from the reaction of the state 
department to the dismissal of the Benazir government and to the formation 
of the CDNS, when no doubt was left that Washington would not intervene on 
the side of the politicians unless a blatant and direct military rule was 
imposed.

LAHORE, Feb 3: The Pakistan Muslim Leagues success in the Punjab Assembly 
polls was as comprehensive as its win on the provinces National Assembly 
seats.
    
It was reported to have bagged 108 PA seats in the 248-member house, 
according to unofficial results received till last reports came in.
    
The Pakistan Peoples Party not only lost in all provincial constituencies 
except two, the margin of its defeat was startlingly large. It was a rout 
in a province which had helped to bring two Bhuttos to power twice in 26 
years. It now seems as if the largest province has withdrawn its support to 
the PPP.

LAHORE, Feb 3: The chance to sit in a Pajero was one compelling factor 
which made Baba Rahima  a voter in village Manga (polling station number 
42) in NA 99  to cast his vote. Aged around 60, he felt overjoyed sitting 
in a glistening blue Pajero owned by a contestant.

I dont care who wins or loses. I have enjoyed (the ride), a gleeful Baba 
Rahima said. Talking to this correspondent he said it had been a life-long 
dream for him to sit in a Pajero. When asked whom he had voted for, the 
baba said: Obviously for my benefactor. The Pajero was bountifully 
decorated with stickers.

A number of other jeeps were also seen in the area bringing voters.

ISLAMABAD, Feb 3: The cricket star turned politician Imran Khan who 
contested the election for eight national assembly seats, failed to win a 
single seat, ending any thought that he would emerge as a third political 
force in the country.
    
Mr Khan who now heads the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf political party, besides 
running a cancer hospital, was believed to be winning at least his personal 
seat along with bagging couple of more seats for his partymen.
    
However, he could not be returned to the national assembly as was generally 
being projected by both political and non-political quarters. Analysts said 
that he too was the victim of the new wave that ran across the country in 
favour of Pakistan Muslim League(N) and despite having lot of support from 
the youth, he did not even secure a single seat for himself.
    
He is on record as having said in a TV interview that he did not care even 
if he would not secure a single seat, and that he has a long way to go in 
politics to make his presence felt both in the public and the 
establishment.

<a name="lowt">Low turnout marks elections</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dawn Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 3: Early trends indicated that the election 1997 which was 
characterised by an unusually low turnout was going in favour of the 
Pakistan Muslim League of Nawaz Sharif.
    
President Farooq Leghari while talking to reporters at the PTV election 
studio late in the evening disclosed that in urban Punjab the turn out was 
26 per cent while in rural areas it was 27 per cent.
    
The nine-hour long, largely peaceful polling for the national and 
provincial assemblies ended today at the appointed time with the voter 
turnout remaining significantly low throughout the country.

In most of the constituencies polling started about one to two hour late 
due to administrative problems and in the Punjab and Federal capital foggy 
weather also intervened. The pace of voting also remained very slow and the 
general pattern of low turnout was clearly visible every where.

While the uncertainty about polls which had remained high throughout the 
three months and the fact that the election rules had made it almost 
impossible for the candidates to spend lavishly on their campaigns had had 
a dampening impact on the election activity. The main reason for the low 
turnout appeared to be the doubts harboured by voters about the fate of 
winning candidates who, according to the new laws, could be disqualified 
either because they had spent more than the limit imposed on election 
expenses or because they had made wrong declaration of their assets.

<a name="euob">EU observers point out deficiencies in poll process</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 5: The European Union election observers group has 
monitored serious deficiencies in the electoral process, and advised 
Pakistan to hold an early census to avoid distortions in the system.

In general the poll was conducted in accordance with the rules and in an 
equitable manner and that the results reflected the wishes of those who 
voted. However, serious deficiencies, in the electoral register and the 
identification of voters, excluded a significant proportion of those who 
had the right to vote, concluded the final report of the group here on 
Wednesday.

It also said that the failure to hold a census since 1981, despite 
constitutional requirements, and rapid demographic change, had led to 
distortions and imbalances in the number and distribution of 
constituencies.

There is no doubt that this detracts in a fundamental way from the 
representative character of the parliamentary system in Pakistan. It is 
important that a census be held and constituency boundaries be reviewed 
before the next elections, the report said.

<a name="pppr">PPP rejects election results</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Feb 5: The Central Executive Committee (CEC) of the Pakistan 
Peoples Party said on Wednesday that the February 3 general elections were 
massively rigged and refused to accept its results.

However for promoting and protecting the parliamentary form of government 
and maintaining political and economic stability, the CEC decided that it 
would not launch any movement for the time being.

The meeting, chaired by former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, considered at 
length the outcome of the general elections and accused the Secretary 
Election Commission of having a hostile attitude towards the party as he 
was suspended by the PPP government.

The decision whether to sit in the assembly or not will be taken by the 
parliamentary party of the PPP in its meeting to be held a day before the 
assembly session, the CEC decided.

The CEC was of the view that the people of Pakistan have been robbed of an 
opportunity to elect their representatives through a free, fair and 
impartial election.

The process of manipulation was started with the installation of a 
hostile, biased, partial and highly controversial caretaker set up at the 
federal and provincial levels, the meeting observed.

It said the caretakers immediately set up the state apparatus against the 
PPP by arresting its leaders and workers on false, frivolous charges and 
conducting a media trial of the party and its leadership on concocted 
charges, promulgation of tinted election laws aimed deliberately to give 
advantage to the adversaries of the PPP, manipulation of the local 
administration by way of transfers, postings and selective issuance of the 
national identity cards to the opponents of the PPP.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, Feb 4: Pakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif has swept the 
national and Punjab assemblies seats while in the NWFP it has shared the 
spoils with its former ally ANP and in Sindh and Balochistan it has made 
significant gains.
    
The Balochistan National Party (BNP) has romped home in Balochistan with 
the largest number of seats.
    
The unofficial results give the PML an absolute majority in the national 
and the Punjab assemblies while its nearest rival, the PPP, has been routed 
in all the provinces except in Sindh.
    
The so-called third force, Tehrik-i-Insaf of Imran Khan, has failed to win 
even a single provincial or National Assembly seat.
    
It is clear now that the PML will form governments at the Centre and the 
Punjab without entering into an alliance with other parties.

Interestingly, in both the national and Punjab assemblies, the opposition 
would be almost non-existent while in NWFP too the opposition would be too 
insignificant if the PML and ANP join hands. It is not very clear which 
parties or party would sit in the opposition in Balochistan.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz has agreed to continue economic changes</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Feb 5: The first test of the new PML Governments commitment 
to economic reforms would be whether they adopt the reforms and laws passed 
by the caretaker government, Adviser to PM on Finance, Mr. Shahid Javed 
Burki said on Wednesday.

Talking to Dawn in Washington he said in initial meetings with him before 
the elections, the PML leadership had agreed to continue with the reforms 
but there would be political pressures on the new government to abandon 
some of the targets set by the IMF.

Burki claimed that in three months the caretakers had done a great lot for 
which I am very proud of myself and the dream team that I had.

A paper prepared on its achievements, the caretakers government claimed 
successes in three key areas - stabilisation of the economy, structural 
transformation and poverty alleviation.

I stopped the nose dive and brought the economy to a plain, stable level, 
Mr. Burki claimed.

Under the title of stabilisation of the economy, the government paper 
claims improvements were made in fiscal, monetary and external finances. 
The government expenditure was cut by Rs 36.1 billion or 7.2 per cent of 
the total GDP of Rs 500 billion, an improvement in resource mobilisation of 
Rs. 55.3 billion was achieved in Nov-Dec 96 as against last year and tight 
monetary policy reduced bank borrowing from Rs 65.7 billion on Oct 31 to Rs 
58.8 billion on Dec 31, it said.

In the external finances sector it claimed foreign exchange reserves were 
built up from $ 614 million in end of October to $ 836 million in December. 
Likewise trade gap declined to $ 160 million in December compared to $ 300 
million in November.

In structural reforms introduced by the caretaker government, Mr. Burki 
claimed 30 measures had been adopted in 13 different areas including 
reforms in the banking sector, monetary and fiscal policy, capital market, 
NFC, privatisation, re-defining governments role, trade and tariffs, 
improving statistical base and strengthening of planning process.

Deregulation of the petroleum sector, packages for textile industry and 
drainage programme for agriculture besides establishment of a poverty 
alleviation fund, food vouchers and a safety net for the poor, encouraging 
private sector education and stipends for the poor were also part of the 
measures taken by the caretakers.

Mr. Burki would be returning to Islamabad for a day or two to brief the new 
government leaders on Sunday but for all practical purposes he has finished 
his job assigned to him for three months.

Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 4: Businessmen are looking at the Monday election results 
which returned Mr Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League with a thumping 
majority in National Assembly with optimism and in their statements on 
Tuesday have expressed the hope of revival of economic activities in the 
country.
    
The PML(N) headed by Nawaz Sharif is being considered a businessmen 
friendly political party and industrialists and businessmen expect creation 
of an environment which would facilitate trade and industry in moving 
ahead.
    
A new era has dawned and the country should witness economic progress and 
prosperity in the days ahead, hopes the President of Federation of 
Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Senator Ilays Ahmed Bilour. 
   
In a statement, he said that the success secured by Mr. Sharif is 
indicative of the fact that the people have confidence in him and consider 
him as the only person who could pull the country out of the present 
degeneration.
    
He hoped that Mr Sharif would take the business community, particularly the 
FPCCI, along in formulating the economic policies of his government.

<a name="fdiw">FDI worth $16.73bn expected in 9th Plan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, Feb 1: Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Pakistan is expected to 
soar to $16.738 billion during the 9th Five-Year Plan to be launched next 
year owing to some major structural changes in the rules governing foreign 
capital.
    
According to projections made by the Board of Investment (BoI) after taking 
into account the last five year plans capital inflow and the financial 
reforms undertaken by the former two governments of Nawaz Sharif and 
Benazir Bhutto, the FDI is expected to soar to $16.738 billion as against 
$1.654 billion inflow of FDI during 7th Five-Year Plan and $3.899 billion 
during the first four years of 8th Five-Year Plan, up to Dec 1996. FDIs 
are largely dependent on the perception of investors and the investment 
friendly incentives as well as environment, the board official said and 
added that they were subject to change because of economic and allied 
economic factors.
    
Foreign investors also take into account the investment opportunities in 
the region surrounding Pakistan, they said adding there could be a 
possible shortfall in the projected figures from the actual inflows of FDI 
in subsequent years.
    
Out of the total inflow of FDI during first four years of 8th Five-Year 
Plan (up to Dec 1996), an investment of $1.181 billion from USA topped the 
list followed by $928 million from UK and $167.3 million from Japan.

<a name="thee">The economics of elections</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Farrukh Saleem

ELECTIONS or no elections, PML(N) is the only political entity that is 
already laughing all the way to the bank. One hundred and seventy- seven 
National Assembly (NA) candidates and around 30 dozen contestants on the 
four Provincial Assembly seats have had to cough up a good Rs 10 crore so 
that they could get their hands on what is being perceived as winning 
tickets.
    
The top PPP hierarchy had also fetched black-market prices for their 
tickets both in 1988 and in 1993. This year PPP has given 160 NA tickets. 
   
Out of the one-hundred-and-sixty tickets, the PPP has surely managed small 
amounts from the feudal-dominated belt of Southern Punjab and from some 
rural constituencies in the interior of Sindh, but by and large Benazir, is 
finding it difficult to get much in return for party tickets.
    
The PML, PPP, and some independent candidates have, in the meanwhile, been 
converting some of their dollars stashed away during previous regimes in 
order to finance their domestic election campaigns. 
   
The en masse conversion of dollars by potential legislators has improved 
the rupee-dollar parity from a low of Rs 43.50 to the current level of 
around Rs 41.90. The rupees strength, to be sure, is transient. This year 
there are 1,853 candidates on 217 NA seats and 4,424 contestants on 483 PA 
seats.
    
While the CECs limit on election expenses stands at Rs 10 lakh for NA 
candidates and Rs 6 lakh of PA constituencies, most party- backed, 
especially PML and PPP candidates; would be spending anywhere from 250 per 
cent to 500 per cent higher than the CEC limit.
    
There is bound to be widespread violations of CEC limits, but certainly not 
as severe as has been the case in previous elections. 
   
Tonga wallas in rural constituencies, bus owners, paid voters and muscle-
men are all going to be employed and paid well by NA and PA candidates, but 
thanks to the new election laws noisy street rallies, rowdy party meetings, 
banners, party flags and placards of all sorts have been restricted giving 
a more docile look to the overall election campaign. 
   
Additionally, this election year may actually be the first time that all 
the three major party leaders- Nawaz, Benazir, and Imran have leased out 
helicopters in order to stay comfortable and also to visit more 
constituencies than has been possible in the past.
    
The election may also set a new record as far as the number of women 
candidates contesting on general seats is concerned. 
   
There are some 38 constituencies on which female candidates are taking 
part. One of the most interesting is NA-164 where Begum Nusrat Bhutto, 
Ashraf Khatoon, Rasheeda Khohro, Sabiha Sultana and Ghinwa Bhutto are all 
candidates. All said and done, the 6,277 want to be legislators would have 
spent more than Rs 3 billion or an equivalent of some $75 million from the 
beginning of the election campaign up until February 3.
    
Moving over to the Election Commission, it is still in the process of 
seeing up some 43,000 polling stations as opposed to 34,000 that were set 
up in 1993.
   
The Commission has already engaged at least 6 lakh people to manage affairs 
at these polling stations. A total of 53,244 persons all of grade 17, 18, 
and 19 mostly from the Education Department are also being trained as 
Presiding Officers, Assistant Presiding Officers and ballot papers are 
still being printed. Estimated costs: Rs 10 crore.
    
The Election Commission has also requested the assistance of 250,000 armed 
forces (108,000 were used 1993) personnel  150,000 at polling stations and 
an additional 100,000 to maintain law and order. Although this year the 
armed forces have decided not to change the routine internal security 
allowance this assistance (sought under Article 220) nevertheless involves 
an implicit expense of more than Rs 1 crore. This help from the armed 
forces is, of course, in addition to the CECs own workers whose numbers 
are expected to reach 600,000 at the cost of some Rs 20 crore.
    
Between November 5 and February 3 the nation may eventually be poorer by Rs 
100 crore on the election account alone. Considering that no more than 25 
million voters would go out and actually cast their vote. That translates 
into an extremely high per-voter cost of Rs 200 per election (education 
budget Rs 12 per Pakistani per year, health budget Rs 24 per Pakistani per 
year) A comparison of election expenses to what that the government spends 
on education or on the health sector makes any election exercise even more 
depressing.
    
The Budget 96-97 allocated a more Rs 160 crore for education and a party Rs 
320 crore for the health sector. Just where do our national priorities 
really lie? Election or education? Election or health? Did the President 
even given any consideration to such issues before dissolving the 
assemblies?
    
The possibility of restoration of the Assembly which is no more there has 
indeed been a cause for most candidates keeping their election expenses on 
a tight leash.

<a name="burk">Burki terms situation in Pakistan disappointing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 30: The prime ministers adviser on finance, Shahid Javed 
Burki, left here for Washington on Thursday to represent Pakistan at a 
micro-enterprise summit there.
    
I am going to Washington to represent Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid at 
a summit, convened to offer support to small industries in the developing 
countries, Mr Burki said before leaving Islamabad.
    
He told reporters that he would stay in the United States for sometime 
after attending the summit and come back on February 10. Then I would 
finally go back to Washington on Feb 13, he said adding that he had no 
plans to serve any other future government in Pakistan.
    
Answering a question , Mr Burki said he would also be meeting high 
officials of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund during his 
stay in the US.
    
There is no specific agenda to be discussed with the World Bank and the 
IMF but I would hold talks with them on various issues including further 
support for the economic stabilisation programme in Pakistan, the adviser 
stated.
    
He said both the institutions had been extremely helpful to Pakistan, 
specially in getting the country out of the crisis created by the Benazir 
government.
    
Replying to a question, Mr Burki said the IMF had just released the third 
tranche of 76 million dollars. He hoped that the future government would 
continue to implement the reforms introduced by the caretakers , to avoid 
problems.
    
Asked to comment on his stay in Pakistan, he said it was very 
disappointing. My biggest disappointment is that every institution in 
Pakistan has been destroyed and things look more horrifying when I find 
that people do not realise their responsibilities, Mr Burki said.
    
He said there were many good people in every section of the society. It is 
true that a handful bad eggs have done the real damage but nobody is there 
to check them to stop further damage, he said.
    
For me it was a painful shock to find corruption everyone, he said 
praying that the future government should realise the gravity of the 
problem and avoid indulging in corrupt practices and serve its people 
honestly. He said Pakistan was potentially a rich country and the only need 
was that its resources were utilised honestly and efficiently.

<a name="volu">Volume soars to record 88m shares on Nawazs victory</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 4: The Karachi Stock Exchange on Tuesday gave an enthusiastic 
welcome to the overwhelming victory of Nawaz Sharif in the national 
elections as the post-election session saw the 100-share index gaining 
another 52 points. Volume soared to a record figure of 88 million shares.
    
There were no pleasant surprises in the rings as the market has already 
voted him to power in the pre-election sessions as was reflected by the 
buying euphoria.
    
The victory is incredible even beyond the markets initial perceptions, 
some dealers said.
    
It is a tidal wave which took the entire Punjab in its fold and wiped out 
everything which came in its way putting the former prime minister again in 
the saddle, another said.
    
Dealers said the victory is overwhelming and there are reasons to believe 
that the current buying euphoria could be sustained in the coming sessions 
too.
    
What is more important is that foreign investors are back in the rings in a 
big way and made massive buying on some of the leading MNCs at the lower 
levels.
    
The market needs political stability to thrive and the current elections 
ensure it is there, said a leading foreign fund manager.

Trading volume soared to 88 million shares, the fourth best single-session 
figure. The previous record being at 112.736 million shares established on 
March 28 in 1996 after the news of privatisation of Pakistan 
Telecommunication. PTC alone accounted for 55 million shares on that day.
    
Stocks rise and fall with the Nawaz Sharif government, the post-election 
session proved an old adage in more than one ways, dealers said.
    
The index gained over 100 points during the pre and post-elections sessions 
and consolidated its position well above the 1,600 points resistance level 
at 1,648.00 points as compared to 1,597.26 on Sunday.
    
Most floor brokers believe that irrespective of the weak economy the 
sailing in the rings now on word might be smooth and there are reasons to 
believe that foreign investors might remain active buyers.
    
Plus signs were again strewn all over the list as investors rushed in to 
cover positions at the lower levels.
    
The interesting feature was that most of the textile shares virtually raced 
towards their pre-reaction levels under the lead of Nishat Mills and Asim 
Textiles, rising by Rs 3.
    
Bank shares were also actively traded at the lower levels and rose in 
unison, major gainers among them being Askari Bank, Bank Al-Habib, Crescent 
Bank, Bankers Equity, PICIC and KASB & Co.
    
Adamjee Insurance followed them rising by Rs 6 and so did Dadabhoy 
Insurance and EFU Life Insurance. Others also rose.
    
Dewan Salman and Dhan Fibre were actively traded with the former showing a 
big increase of Rs 4.30 and so did Gatron Industries, rising by Rs 4.
    
Energy shares also rose in unison under the lead of National Refinery and 
PSO, and so were most of the leading MNCs which showed good gains.
    
However, biggest gains were noted in Siemens Pakistan, BOC Pakistan, Dawood 
Hercules, Gillette Pakistan and Pakistan Gum Chemicals, rising by Rs 3 to 
8.
    
Barring Fateh Textiles, which fell by Rs 5, other losses were modest and 
confined to 4th and 8th ICP mutual funds and Atlas Battery.
    
The most active was again led by Hub-Power, which was massively traded, up 
95 paisa on 20.810 million shares, followed by PTC vouchers, sharply higher 
by Rs 1.45 on 18.883m, Dewan Salman, sharply higher by Rs 4.30 on 12.209m, 
ICI Pakistan, up one rupee on 9.546m, and Dhan Fibre, higher 50 paisa on 
5.485m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, firm 95 
paisa on 0.600m, Nishat Mills, up Rs 2 on 0.306m, LTV Modaraba, steady 75 
paisa on 0.310m, and PICIC, higher one rupee on 0.236m shares.
    
There were 278 actives out of which 231 shares rose, 15 fell with 32 
holding on to the last levels.

<a name="diss">Dissolution 1996</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

FINALLY, pushed out of his bed early in the morning of Tuesday November 5, 
1996, President Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan, Tumandar of the Legharis, under 
the powers vested in him in terms of Article 58 (2)(B) of the Constitution, 
dissolved Benazir Bhuttos National Assembly, proclaiming:
    
Whereas during the last three years thousands of persons in Karachi and 
other parts of Pakistan have been deprived of their right to life in 
violation of Article 9 of the Constitution.
    
And Whereas on September 20, 1996 Mir Murtaza Bhutto, the brother of the 
Prime Minister, was killed in Karachi along with seven of his companions 
including the brother-in-law of a former Prime Minister, ostensibly in an 
encounter with the Karachi Police. The Prime Minister and her Government 
claimed that Mir Murtaza Bhutto has been murdered as part of a conspiracy.
    
And whereas on March 20, 1996 the Supreme Court of Pakistan delivered its 
judgement in the case popularly known as the Appointment of Judges Case. 
The Prime Minister ridiculed the judgement in a speech before the National 
Assembly which was shown more than once on nation-wide television. The 
implementation of the judgement was resisted and deliberately delayed in 
violation of the Constitutional mandate that all executive and judicial 
authorities throughout Pakistan shall act in aid of the Supreme Court.
    
And Whereas the sustained assault on the judicial organ of State has 
continued under the garb of a Bill moved in Parliament for the prevention 
of corrupt practices.

And whereas the judiciary has still not been fully separated from the 
executive in violation of the provisions of Article 175(3) of the 
Constitution and the deadline for such separation fixed by the Supreme 
Court of Pakistan.
    
And whereas the Prime Minister and her government have deliberately 
violated, on a massive scale, the fundamental right of privacy guaranteed 
by Article 14 of the Constitution. This has been done through illegal 
phone-tapping and eavesdropping techniques. The phones which have been 
tapped and the conversations that have been monitored in this 
unconstitutional manner includes phones and conversations of judges of the 
superior courts, leaders of political parties and high-ranking military and 
civil officers.  And whereas corruption, nepotism and violation of rules 
in the administration of the affairs of the Government and its various 
bodies, authorities and corporations has become so extensive and widespread 
that the orderly functioning of Government in accordance with the 
provisions of the Constitution and the law has become impossible and in 
some cases national security has been endangered. Public faith in the 
integrity and honesty of the Government has disappeared. Members of the 
Government and the ruling parties are either directly or indirectly 
involved in such corruption, nepotism and rule violations. Innumerable 
appointments have been made at the instance of members of the National 
Assembly in violation of the law declared by the Supreme Court that 
allocation of quotas to MNAs and MPAs for recruitment to various posts was 
offensive to the Constitution and the law and that all appointments were to 
be made on merit, honestly and objectively and in the public interest. The 
transfers and postings of Government servants have similarly been made in 
equally large numbers at the behest of members of the National Assembly and 
other members of the ruling parties. The members have violated their oath 
of office and the Government has not for three years taken any effective 
steps to ensure that the legislators do not interfere in the orderly 
executive functioning of Government.
    
And whereas the Constitutional requirement that the Cabinet together with 
the ministers of State shall be collectively responsible to the National 
Assembly has been violated by the induction of a Minister against whom 
criminal cases are pending which the Interior Minister has refused to 
withdraw. In fact, at an earlier stage the Interior Minister had announced 
his intention to resign if the former was inducted into the Cabinet. A 
Cabinet in which one Minister is responsible for the prosecution of a 
Cabinet colleague cannot be collectively responsible in any manner 
whatsoever.
    
And whereas in the matter of the sale of Burmah Castrol shares in PPL and 
BONE/PPL shares in Qadirpur Gas Field involving national assets valued in 
several billions of rupees, the President required the Prime Minister to 
place the matter before the Cabinet for consideration of the decisions 
taken in this matter by the ECC. This has still not been done, despite a 
lapse of over four months, in violation of the provisions of Article 46 and 
48 of the Constitution.
    
Had the President acted earlier, as was expected of him, somewhat more of 
the nations fast dwindling wealth might have been saved. The grounds were 
challenged by the dismissed Prime Minister, convinced that it was her 
birthright to rule over the 140 millions who make up this nation, howsoever 
corruptly, inefficiently and nepotistically.
    
Oxford educated Benazir confidently chose Cambridge Chaudhry Aitzaz Ahsan 
and others to represent her, and Oxford educated President Leghari 
appointed Cambridge men Khalid Anwer and Makhdoom Ali Khan and others to 
respond.
    
Her petition was heard by a Bench of seven judges of our Supreme Court, 
comprising Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, Justices Saleem Akhtar, Fazal 
Elahi Khan, Zia Mehmood Mirza, Irshad Hassan Khan, Raja Afrasiab Khan, and 
Munawwar Ahmed Mirza. The Chief Justice and five of his brethren dismissed 
Benazirs petition on all counts except for the one relating to Murtazas 
murder, Justice Zia Mehmood Mirza dissenting.
    
A significant development is that corruption, that has eaten into our very 
core, has now been adjudged as being a ground for dissolution. One other 
significant factor is the consistency of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, sole 
dissenter in the 1993 Nawaz Sharif dissolution case when the Assembly was 
restored, upholding the previous judgement in the 1990 Benazir dissolution 
case when it was not.
    
Thus have we been rid of the worst, the most corrupt, the most inefficient, 
and the most marauding government we, the people, have had the misfortune 
to endure and barely survive. Now we must hope again, as we always do 
whenever a government changes, that what that great and only statesman of 
ours, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, told my father Rustom, fifty years ago  that 
each successive government of this country was destined to be worse than 
its predecessor  will no more ring true.
    
After the judgement was announced, Benazirs supporters led by Nahid Khan, 
danced the Jiala jig outside the Supreme Court and made a nuisance of 
themselves. Benazir herself, later in the evening on the BBC, came out with 
a couple of prize-winners: The Bhuttos cannot be defeated politically, 
their party the PPP cannot be defeated politically, so other means have to 
be found to defeat them.
    
Did she mean that she and the party cannot be defeated politically because, 
in true fascistic style, they are postmasters at the art of robbing the 
people and the country, amassing money, and buying bogus loyalty to ensure 
numbers and thus frustrate any chance of a vote of no-confidence against 
them? The only other means available to the people are either martial law 
or Article 58(2)(b).
    
The winning lawyer, Khalid Cicero Anwer, feels confident that the 
judgement will ensure that the future government will be a clean 
government and will not repeat the mistakes of the past.
    
Meanwhile, accountability has gone to the dogs. Nothing has so far been 
achieved on that front. No robber of substance has been held accountable 
for his past misdeeds and that the big fish have all been deliberately 
allowed to escape through the mesh. Chief Ehtesab Commissioner Justice 
Ghulam Mujjadid Mirza, on television the night before the short order was 
announced, stated that the accountability process is being purposefully 
disrupted. Delays are being created by corrupt officials, and I am using 
the word corrupt with full responsibility, he told the people. Officials 
are either not interested in sending cases forward or they are incompetent.
    
As for our banks, they are being set up by the caretakers, made ready to be 
easily accessible to the coming government, perfect targets for robbers and 
looters. How many remember that caretaker Moeen Qureshi appointed Maula 
Baksh Abbasi to head the NDFC against the strong protest of caretaker 
finance minister Babar Ali? NDFC was robbed clean, MB moved on and on and 
having successfully finished off all the institutions he headed under this 
past PPP regime, is now in Karachi Central Jail. Will Moeen Qureshi 
consider reimbursing the country?
    
Does caretaker Meraj Khalid know that, quite against the wishes of the 
finance ministry, Ghulam Farid Abbasi has been made the chairman of our 
large Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan? Governor Yaqub of the 
State Bank, who sat by while the banks and financial institutions were 
being robbed during the past three PPP years, has been re-appointed by 
these caretakers to head the State Bank for a further two years. The show 
goes on.

<a name="refr">Benazirs refreshing stance</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ONE must welcome without hesitation Ms Benazir Bhuttos pledge on Tuesday 
to extend her full co-operation to Mian Nawaz Sharif and work with the next 
government to consolidate democracy. In remarks that perhaps reflected the 
coming of age of Ms Bhutto as a mature political leader, the former prime 
minister surprised newsmen by wishing good luck to the next prime 
minister and alluding to his victory as one coming from God Almighty. Not 
even Mrs Gandhi, she said, had received such a majority after she won the 
war against Pakistan in 1971. Even though the PPP chairperson still 
expressed serious reservations about the fairness of Mondays general 
election and alleged manipulation of the results, the thrust of her remarks 
exhibited a refreshing positivism. The former prime minister drew 
satisfaction from the fact that the Muslim League had managed to have a 
two-thirds majority in the National Assembly. While she had a dig at 
President Leghari for failing in his purported mission to install a kings 
party in power, she rightly inferred that a government with a solid 
majority in parliament was less likely to be open to pressures from non-
political forces. She, therefore, hoped that the next government would be 
able to complete its five-year term. What, however, Ms Bhuttos Press 
conference would be remembered for was her categorical declaration that she 
would not launch an agitation in the larger interest of democracy. In that 
process, the former prime minister defined what she perceived to be the 
Oppositions parliamentary role. Her logic was one with which no one would 
disagree. An agitation may bring a government down, followed by a rigged 
election, which would bring to power a weak government that would again be 
unable to complete its term and be thrown out. So this process would 
continue. Somebody, she said, had to bring this vicious circle to an end, 
and she was that person. 

Undeniably, both Mian Nawaz Sharifs and Ms Bhuttos hands have been 
tainted with intrigues of the worst kind, for neither has in the past 
hesitated to rely on the politics of agitation and unprincipled alliances 
with undemocratic forces to oust elected governments. The fall of Ms 
Bhuttos two governments and Mr Sharifs in 1993 stemmed from agitation, 
malicious intrigue and brazen street power and not from a transparent 
political process. The winners euphoria in each case turned out to be 
short-lived, for the forces that helped one overwhelm ones rival realigned 
with the ousted party to start the process of intrigue and extra-
constitutional manoeuvring all over again. Such a scenario contributes to 
the peoples disillusionment with the politicians on the one hand. On the 
other, its deleterious consequences are to be seen in the absence of long-
term economic and social planning in the country.  With foreign aid having 
dried up in the aftermath of the end of the cold war, Third World 
governments can look only to foreign investment for rapid industrial 
expansion. Needless to say, the political goings-on in Pakistan for the 
last eight years have seriously obstructed, if not cut off, the flow of 
foreign investment in Pakistan. Every successive government in Pakistan has 
tended to view with hostility and suspicion projects launched and deals 
made by the previous government and has often cancelled even viable 
projects. This must stop. Foreign governments, lending agencies and 
multinationals deal with the country and not with the ruling party or 
coalition. They expect successive governments to honour deals and 
agreements. Any arbitrary cancellation of deals and violation of 
international agreements only serve to undermine foreign investors 
confidence in Pakistan and retard development. Ms Bhuttos offer must be 
seen by the victor of Mondays election in the right spirit and he must 
reciprocate in the same spirit. In a democracy, more so in a parliamentary 
one, the government and the Opposition are supposed to manage the states 
affairs jointly. Pakistan has not had this tradition so far, because even 
democratic governments  much less authoritarian ones  have tended to look 
at the Opposition as enemy. Let us hope Ms Bhuttos offer and the 
confidence which a two-thirds majority should give to Mr Sharif will enable 
them to make a joint endeavour to pull Pakistan out of its chaotic, 
undemocratic groove.

<a name="from">*From Jinnah to Benazir and after</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Iftikhar H. Malik

FIFTY-SEVEN years ago on 23rd of March, 1940, a Muslim rally in the 
historic city of Lahore overwhelmingly endorsed a resolution stipulating 
the formation of a sovereign entity comprising Muslim majority provinces in 
British India. The motion had been moved by the All-India Muslim League, a 
party of Muslim modernists led by Jinnah (1876-1948), a London-trained 
barrister and one of the leading political voices in the subcontinent.

To Jinnah and other Leaguers, the Indian National Congress, the India-wide 
political party founded in 1885, despite its avowed aims to serve supra-
communal interests had been unable to attract Muslims. The League, itself 
founded in 1906, aimed at safeguarding the Muslim communitarian interests 
while to Mahatma Gandhi and Pandit Nehru it had come to serve merely 
communalist ideology. Jinnah, an avowed secularist, considered Indian 
political struggle for decolonisation in the 1930s and 1940s to be an 
international problem and refused to accept any solution to the 
constitutional impasse that reduced it to a mere Raj versus Congress 
equation.

Jinnah considered Indian Muslims, compared with other communities, to be 
extremely underprivileged urgently needing a tangible political 
dispensation in the form of a sovereign state so as to engineer an uplift. 
His was the Muslim nationalism rather than being Islamic  a thin yet 
specific line differentiating a general cultural reality from a theocratic 
specificity.

Jinnahs claim to establish territorial state and stipulating Muslim 
characteristics yet disallowing theocracy was hotly contested both by the 
ulema (religious scholars) and the regionalist ethnic elite. But his vision 
of a Pakistan as superordinate identity providing an honest mediation 
amongst various feuding religious / sectarian and regionalist / localist 
affiliations turned out to be a sensible and the best possible stratagem. 
Jinnah foresaw the existence of plural religious communities in the young 
republics of India and Pakistan as the most significant guarantee for it 
peaceful, forward-looking subcontinent. By 1947, Jinnah, an ailing man and 
already quite senior in age, had to suffer an immediate setback that 
definitely must have left him as a broken man. The transborder migrations 
and the accompanying ethnic cleansing in 1947 fuelled the inter-communal 
and inter-state tensions which, all of a sudden, overwhelmed the forces of 
sanity across the region.

On the eve of independence, Jinnah, in his landmark speech of 11 August 
1947, quite candidly observed: You are free, you are free to go to your 
temples, you are free to go to your mosques or other places of worship in 
this state of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed  
that has nothing to do with the business of the State. Despite the 
communal riots, to the founder of the country, this creed was to anchor the 
official policies. He had never exploited religious sentiments to further 
any parochial or personal cause and used Islam in a cultural and symbolic 
sense to forge solidarity amongst the disparate Muslim communities and had 
been rebuked by Ulema who named him as the Kafir-i-Azam (the great infidel) 
instead of his more popular tile of the Quaid-i-Azam (the great Leader).

Jinnahs vision of a democratic, tolerant, plural and egalitarian Pakistan 
was dashed down soon after his death when the oligarchies led by the 
bureaucrats and generals took over the new state and began using Islam so 
as to earn legitimacy for their non-representative regimes. The ulema 
became the unofficial ayatollahs for various regimes which inherently 
abhorred constitutionalism, decentralisation and accountability. In 
addition the very ethno-centricism of such regimes, despite their modernist 
postulations betrayed their national objectives.

*From Ghulam Mohammad, a bureaucrat-turned executive, to his long line of 
successors and from generals Iskander Mirza to Ayub Khan and Zia-ul-Haq, 
democratic and pluralist forces were either simply suppressed or surpassed 
with religious symbols providing the convenient legitimising ideology. Even 
a populist leader like Zulfikar Ali Bhutto occasionally capitulated to 
religious pressures to exact political support. During the Zias regime, 
exploitation of religious ideology both for domestic and external purposes 
cost Pakistan immensely.

The suppression of normal democratic processes only multiplied acute 
dissensions within the society and state. Other than ethnic conflict, 
Shia-Sunni feuds have claimed numerous innocent lives whereas politicians 
while mired in sleaze and unchecked corruption could not establish clean 
and efficient administration. The country, in a drift, has kept 
accumulating massive foreign debts with life for an ordinary Pakistani 
becoming almost unbearable.

The countrys obsolete institutions allow only the landed elites to 
monopolise its assemblies whereas the ad hoc decisions are made by the 
generals and bureaucrats. Curiously, the society has been ready for radical 
and overdue reforms while the state keeps insisting on status quo and that 
is why elections have more often failed to bring in some fresh blood. 
Jinnahs Pakistan of parliamentary democracy exists only in ideals.

Undoubtedly, for Benazir Bhutto and her predecessor (and successor, Nawaz 
Sharif) it was a stupendous job to retrieve democratic and tolerant values 
from a chaotic and fractious legacy, but that is what the leadership is all 
about. Ecologically, culturally, linguistically, demographically and 
politically, Pakistan is a well-defined polity though it does have its own 
share of acute ideological and ethnic problems. it is located in an arc of 
crises and especially in the light of unresolved problem over Kashmir with 
India and a constantly volatile Afghanistan, the country is awash with guns 
and drugs yet every sensible Pakistani desires a peaceful co-existence, a 
just system and a tolerant society.

Pakistanis have struggled hard against odds and have been given a rough 
deal mostly by their own leaders who have lacked both vision and courage 
though the country has always welcomed political processes rather than 
authoritarianism and has persistently voted for moderate and mundane forces 
rejecting religious extremists.

A vital leadership proves itself only by rising to the challenges of 
nation-building and time may run out for politicians as the forces of 
militarism and fundamentalism may sweep the country. Malady will not simply 
go away by just holding meaningless elections and by merely wasting public 
funds and resources on ostentatious regalia.

Pakistan does need a transparent and responsible government that may come 
about only through internal stability, consolidation of democracy and an 
accountable system. Religious freedom, democracy and tolerance as promised 
and visualised by the founders of the country need to be implemented and 
the country is definitely ready for that. While the policymakers, police 
and administrative machinery may be corrupt and inept, efforts for a 
cleaner and decentralised civil administration must be given priority. 
Similarly the religious and ethnic leaders have to be reined in through 
negotiations and by non-partisan and bold cooptive initiatives. The mafia 
gangs, loan/tax defaulters and similar other criminals  disallowing any 
personal/political favour  must not be left at large.

Similarly, there is greater need to initiate overdue dialogue with India in 
the spirit of regional co-operation to redirect the scarce funds towards 
development schemes addressed at a vast youthful expectant society. These 
are the tasks which would not only put Pakistan on its right Jinnahist 
tracks but would also elevate present leaders as the pioneers for a more 
democratic, just and forward-looking Pakistan.

<a name="them">The moment of truth </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mazdak

BY the time this column appears, the Supreme Court will have delivered its 
verdict, and the nation will have found out whether or not it is going to 
be called yet again to elect a new government.
    
Apart from legal uncertainties, one reason for the lukewarm reaction of 
voters to the whole exercise is the fact that this is the fourth time their 
decision has been ultimately overruled by that shadowy group that is 
collectively called the Establishment.
    
To be sure, our short-sighted, venal and inefficient leaders give this 
group every excuse for sacking them. The rest of us are disgusted and 
depressed spectators of this tired game of musical chairs. So the average 
Pakistani voter can be forgiven his lack of enthusiasm. But over and above 
this disenchantment with our political class is anger over the arrogance of 
a handful of men who think they know what is good for us, and pre-empt our 
right to throw an unacceptable government out. In brief, what we are told 
time and again is that while we have the right to vote a party into power, 
we do not have the right to throw it out when its term is over. This power, 
it seems, has been reserved only for the President and his men.
    
It is important to realise that this right is the other side of the 
democratic coin: unless elected leaders realise that the same voters who 
brought them into the corridors of power can show them the door, they will 
forget about them once installed. After their swearing in, they will pay 
lip-service to the electorate, while focusing on pleasing the (unelected) 
Establishment that is perceived to hold the key to power. It is a 
historical fact that while several governments have been voted into power 
in Pakistan, not a single one has been voted out. And at each dissolution 
of assemblies, it has been a case of the Establishment knowing what is best 
for us, never mind that each time, we have been landed in a bigger mess. 
More than once, these illegal or quasi-constitutional interventions have 
been motivated by ambition masquerading under the garb of concern over the 
state of the nation.
    
The answer to poorly managed democracy is more  and not less  democracy. 
And yet there are intelligent and highly educated people in this country 
who doubt the average voters ability to cast his vote sensibly. However, 
this same elite seldom bothers to register their names on the electoral 
list, and take the trouble to actually queue up and vote even less 
frequently. This disdain of the common mans common sense reflects a 
paternalistic attitude not far removed from the whole ethos behind 
Kiplings White Mans Burden. Uneducated natives, it seems, cannot 
discern between good and bad candidates, and therefore, the Establishment 
is forced to intervene from time to time to rescue them from the results of 
their own folly. Forget that more often than not, this rescue operation 
causes far more problems than it resolves.
    
One of the major problems with both the previous elected governments was 
that once in power, both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif seemed to act as 
though they were not answerable to parliament and the electorate but to the 
President and the COAS of the day. If it has achieved anything at all, the 
infamous Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution has eroded the sovereignty of 
the people by conferring the power to arbitrarily dissolve Parliament on a 
single individual.
    
Proponents of this constitutional aberration  a large and highly 
articulate tribe  argue that this article has prevented the imposition of 
martial law. They also hold that by creating a balance of power between the 
prime minister and the president, 58 (2)(b) has curtailed executive 
excesses. But has it? As we have been witnessing these past eight years, 
successive governments have acted irresponsibly and capriciously without a 
thought to presidential prerogative until the very last minute. So rather 
than acting as a brake to bad governance, this article has served as a 
sledgehammer.
    
What then is the answer? We are still smarting from the wounds inflicted by 
Asif Zardari and his ilk on the exchequer as well as our pride, so can we 
afford unfettered executive authority? Im afraid theres no easy answer, 
no quick fix to ensure responsible government. Our politicians have to 
mature, our electorate has to become more demanding and our democratic 
institutions have to put down roots before we get clean, decent government. 
Easier said than done, I know, specially as the enormity of the problems 
facing us is such that we do not have the luxury of unlimited time at our 
disposal.
    
However, if we reject the democratic system because of the insatiable greed 
of a few individuals, we will be doing ourselves and future generations a 
huge disservice. Experience around the world has shown that with all its 
imperfections, this is the only system that holds out the promise of 
development coupled with social justice. Autocratic rule of every type has 
been consigned to the dustbin of history. Our case is not unique: other 
democracies have had their teething problems, their share of crooks and 
charlatans and the occasional temptation to take the dictatorial path. But 
by and by, they have progressed to a point where any other system is simply 
unthinkable.
    
When you read this, elections will be only two days away. People ask me who 
Ill vote for. I honestly dont know. I do know that I cant possibly vote 
for any ethnic or sectarian party. I am a liberal person, with all that the 
term implies, and I honestly dont know whether any party today qualifies 
for my vote. Nevertheless, come election day, and I will be standing in 
line, probably still wondering who to vote for.

<a name="afit">A fitting case for world Test championship</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

ON return from Australia after outplaying the home side and outwitting the 
Caribbean cavaliers and with the World Series cup in his possession captain 
Wasim Akram expressed the wish that there should be a Test World Cup among 
the full members of the International Cricket Council.
   
Among the strong cricketing nations only South Africa was unrepresented at 
the Australian World Series venture, fulfilling their own commitment 
initially in India and latterly at home grounds. Wasim, after piloting the 
country to deserving and desired victories against Australia and West 
Indies, was happy that the challenge of two formidable forces in global 
cricket was courageously met and brushed aside on an alien soil and thought 
that time had arrived for the competition to be raised to a higher plane  
a five-day tussle in Test matches to decide ``the real and genuine 
champion of the world. Certainly he had no format ready but he backed the 
idea of a bigger extravaganza in the style and manner of the 21-year 
limited-overs World Cup, which was launched in the summer of 1975 at Lords 
with a match between India and England. This was to be the inaugural 
contest for the one-day honours of the world, eventually clinched by the 
powerful West Indians. The last championship or the title (if the latter 
connotation is to be taken as correct) was claimed by Sri Lanka. Every 
country and critic had to accept the leap forward they had made and the 
high position they had attained in the cricketing world by their mettlesome 
players, fighters to the core on the South Asian fields. But ironically 
enough the World Cup winners were brought down from their high pedestal 
just a fortnight later in Singapore by Pakistan in the Singer Cup. However, 
the Lahore final decided the champions of nascent cricket, as acknowledged 
by the ICC. Will the representatives of the ICC move forward to consider 
and discuss in detail the Test World Cup plan, if at all it can be taken 
out of the Lords cold storage. Wasim Akram said it would be a good change 
(from one-dayers) and people would know which is the best team in the world 
in this strenuous and rigorous five-day contest. 
   
Mark Taylor, after his spinners Michael Bevan and Shane Warne had baffled 
the West Indian at Adelaide and the Australians had won the rubber and kept 
the Frank Worrell Trophy, had laid claim to be the new kings of world Test 
cricket. He dismissed the view that the West Indies were giants of Test 
cricket. Certainly if two captains, one having grabbed the one-day World 
Series Cup and the other having lifted the coveted Worrell Trophy, 
emphasise the   need and necessity of a tussle among the Test playing 
countries the proposal cannot be ignored.
   
World famous medium-pacer and all-rounder Sir Richard Hadlee of New Zealand 
had recently come out with the suggestion of Super Test or world 
championship of Tests. He thought that day by day the limited-overs 
competition was getting so much encouragement that interest in Test matches 
is waning. Nevertheless, the litmus test to determine the strength and 
weakness of national line-ups was the five-day enterprise. A global contest 
involving the nine Test-playing countries would not only attract the 
marketing multinationals and sponsoring mega-industries but would give 
considerable boost to Test cricket and prove once again that it were the 
five-day battles which settle the cricket championship and not the one-day 
spectacles, now numbering over hundred in one calendar year.
   
The proposal had also been voiced in the recent past by Clive Lloyd, Hansie 
Cronje, Ian Chappell and Sunil Gavaskar among other renowned figures of the 
game. However, at the country level it was Dr Ali Bacher of the United 
Cricket Board of South Africa who strongly supported the proposal of Tests 
World Cup. Hadlee, in his suggestion, had detailed a points system for the 
matches and the players. The venues had to be in large numbers in diverse 
countries according to the New Zealand legend.
 
However just to remind the cricket fans it may be mentioned that former 
Chief Executive of Pakistans Board, Arif Ali Abbasi, had prepared a 
thorough and detailed proposal on the subject and despatched it to the 
International Cricket Council headquartered at Lords before its annual 
representative meeting. Abbasi was shunted out of office before he could 
brief the ICC delegates on Pakistans proposal and lobby the idea for 
endorsement. The former cricket supremo wanted Pakistan to be the central 
place for staging the matches. He was confident of getting the sponsorship 
on a major scale for such a big venture. Thirty-nine matches were played 
during the fifth World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 1992. The South 
Asian-organised sixth edition of the venture had 37 ties to be arranged. If 
group-wise Test matches are to be gone through in a round-robin style 
perhaps not more than 20 matches will be competed. The whole idea could 
have been given a practical shape after endorsement from the ICC delegates, 
which was not difficult considering that South Africa was prepared to stand 
by Pakistan and Sri Lanka and India would have given support to the new 
cricket plan as Jagmohan Dalmia was being backed for the top ICC post by 
Pakistan. The lobbying at Lords would have paid the dividends and more 
delegates would have lined up with Pakistan.
   
Regrettably, the new PCB Chief Executive, Majid Khan, who attended last 
Junes annual meeting of ICC, was lukewarm to the idea of world 
championship of Tests and did not do the effort  needed at Lords. The 
proposal was talked out. On return the famed cricketer pointed to logistics 
and sponsorship problems and told the sports scribes that the idea was 
impracticable as far as Pakistan was concerned. Countries like Australia, 
South Africa and India may be successful in such a big  project.
    
As the Chief Executive pointed out last June, the staging of such a big 
gala as the Test World Cup was well nigh impossible in this country with 
the multi-sided problems that it has, it is better to cite an example from 
history.
    
It was in the summer of 1912 that triangular Test matches were played in 
England among Australia, South Africa and England. At that time there were 
only three contestants as they were the countries exchanging visits for 
Test duels. All the encounters were arranged at Englands venues and 
ultimately after the league tussles Australia came second to England with 
South Africa, then a weak conglomerate, finishing last.
    
England with such legends as Hobbs, Spooner, Fry, Woolley and Warner were 
solid in batting. The bowling had the pace of S. F. Barnes and F. R. Foster 
and the superb tricks of Rhodes, Woolley and Hearne. It was an unbeatable 
side. Australia were not at full strength. England, with one of the 
strongest squads ever, duly won the triangular series. The experiment was a 
grand success.
    
In modern times when facilities have so much expanded and the chances of 
sponsorship and marketing have become so much bright there is little doubt 
that a world championship of Tests, if launched, will attract huge crowds 
and achieve the desired results financially.
   
Now that the ICC meeting is not very far away one expects the PCB to put 
forward the proposal before the delegates and get their endorsement. 
Cricket will get considerable boost in the country. More modern facilities 
in cricket centres may be provided. Besides it will be a unique venture 
which will make the coffers of the PCB helftier and heavier.

<a name="akra">Akram decides to skip international events</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Feb 3: The tough off-season commitments of the Pakistan cricket 
team made skipper Wasim Akram its first scalp when the allrounder pulled 
out from at least three international tournaments.
    
The PIA and Lancashire allrounder has made himself available for Pakistan 
only till April and will thus appear in the Sharjah Cup and two Tests 
against Sri Lanka.
    
With the English County Championships starting in the third week of April, 
Wasim Akram will proceed to the North of England from Sri Lanka and will 
miss Mays Singer Cup in Singapore, Sahara Cup in Canada and Asia Cup in 
Sri Lanka (both in August).
    
According to well informed sources, Pakistans tour to India for three one-
day internationals in May have fallen in jeopardy.
    
The PCB had inquired me of my commitments and though I have not informed 
them officially, I have made up my mind that I will only play for Pakistan 
till April before rejoining the team in September, Wasim Akram told this 
correspondent on Monday.
    
Pakistan will be hosting three major events between September and December. 
Pakistan will be organising a quadrangular tournament at Lahore to be 
competed by Sri Lanka, South Africa and the West Indies. Pakistan also hold 
a separate three-Test series each with South Africa and the West Indies.
    
While Wasim Akram has decided about his priorities, Waqar Younis and 
Mushtaq Ahmad are also likely to follow in the footsteps of their skipper. 
Waqar has signed a lucrative two-year contract with Glamorgan while Mushtaq 
has a three-year commitment with Somerset.
    
Although out of selectors favours, Mohammad Akram also has a contract with 
Northamptonshire. Besides these four, a few more cricketers viz Ijaz Ahmad 
Senior, Mohammad Zahid, Shahid Nazir, Mohammad Wasim and Saqlain Mushtaq 
have signed with some English clubs.
    
Saeed Anwar is also negotiating with two countiesHampshire and Essexand 
appears certain to join either of the two.
    
Wasim Akram said he has a county bound for another year. I had finalised 
my commitment well in advance. In this background, the PCB inquired me of 
my plans which I will be conveying to the board.
    
Akram said if he tried to skip matches with Lancashire, his contract for 
the next year may suffer. 1998 is my benefit year and I dont want to ruin 
it. Of course, the PCB understand this. They (Lancashire) wants me for full 
season and thats precisely why they are paying me so heavily.
    
According to an estimate, Akram is getting 100,000 pounds per season while 
Waqar Younis has signed a two-year contract at 220,000 pounds with 
Glamorgan, the former county of Viv Richards and Javed Miandad.

<a name="will">Will results affect PCB set-up?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 4: After the landslide victory of PML (N) in the general 
elections, a major reshuffle is most likely to take place in the Pakistan 
Cricket Board (PCB) hierarchy.
    
The present President of the PCB, Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah Bokhari, who won a 
National Assembly seat for PPP from Jhang in 1993, was not one of the 
contestants this time as PML (N) virtually made a clean sweep of the Jhang 
constituency with only one seat going to an independent candidate.
    
The Treasurer of the PCB, Salman Taseer, who won the National Assembly PPP 
seat in 1993 from Lahore II, crashed to defeat by 35,178 votes in NA-93 as 
he could get only 27,887 votes as compared to PML (N) Mian Abdul Waheed who 
secured 63,065 votes.
    
The two PCB officials were political appointees during Benazir Bhuttos 
government whose Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) failed to find a firm 
footing in the current elections. It will not be out of context to mention 
here that the President of Pakistan is the Patron of the PCB and the two 
top posts are honorary jobs while the Chief Executive is a paid one.
    
The Chief Executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Majid Khan, who 
succeeded Arif Abbasi about eight months ago, may also be under pressure. 
His family sources in Lahore confirmed that he is already in Islamabad.
    
In the background as to what happened after three general elections of 
1988, 1990 and 1993 and the changes thereafter in the cricket board 
offices, the analysts believe that the new government will also follow in 
the traditions of the previous rulers.
    
After PPPs 1988 victory, Lt Gen (Retd) Zahid Ali Akbar was made BCCP 
President while Arif Abbasi was appointed Secretary.
    
Nevertheless, when PML (N) came into power in 1990, Arif Abbasi made way 
for Shahid Rafi in 1991.
    
But when PPP came into powers again after October 1993 elections, the 
officials of the then BCCPthe then Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Dr 
Nasim Hasan Shah, and Shahid Rafi, Chairman, Pakistan Television (President 
and Secretary respectively), had to leave the posts and that too at a time 
when the then BCCP General Body dinner was taking place at a five-star 
hotel in Lahore on Jan 12.
    
Chief Justice (Retd) Nasim Hasan Shahs board was superseded by a three-
member ad hoc committee (Javed Burki, Arif Abbasi and Dr Zafar Altaf).
    
The officials of the renamed PCB were appointed in March 1995 with Arif 
Abbasi as its first paid Chief Executive.
    
Soon after the World Cup, Arif Abbasis contentious appointment in the eyes 
of his rivals came to an end when he was replaced by former Pakistan 
captain and renowned cricketer Majid Khan who was then the Director of 
Sports in Pakistan Television.
    
Cricket observes do not rule out the possibility of a change in the current 
set-up of the PCB.
 
Hasib Ahsan, former chairman of selectors, said it was a great change in 
political front that Mian Nawaz Sharif came into power with such an 
overwhelming majority. Not only the bigger province has supported him, 
smaller ones have also thrown their weight behind him. It now depends on 
him to carry the objectives of all, Ahsan said.
    
Ahsan endorsed Nawaz Sharifs claims of accountability but added 
accountability should also be done in cricket especially in connection with 
the World Cup where several lucrative contracts were awarded to favourite 
people. Those responsible for throwing away the money in cricket should 
also be penalised and Nawaz Sharif is the right man to do the job.
    
Ahsan said changes in the PCB may be imminent. I personally feel that 
reshuffling will start in the next few months.
    
Its time that Chief Justice (Retd) Nasim Hasan Shahs dented reputation 
be restored by appointing him to serve as PCB chief for one term. 
Similarly, Shahid Rafi should also be given a chance to continue his good 
job which was broken in 1994. After all, time has proved that most of his 
decisions, including the appointment of Wasim Akram, who now lead the team 
after four captains were tried, Ahsan concluded.
    
Razaullah Khan, a former BCCP Councillor and a balanced critic, emphasised 
that changes should be made. The cricket picture tells a very sorry story. 
No doubt the team has been winning, we have been losing at many fronts, 
observed Razaullah.
    
Razaullah said Majid Khan has failed to come up to expectations as he 
badly failed as an administrator. He added domestic cricket was in 
shambles, cricket board was confined to just a single zone and World Cup 
accounts were yet to be settled.
    
Mian Nawaz Sharif is a keen cricketer and he has come through a democratic 
process, he should enforce democracy in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) 
where there should be representation of all the provinces, Razaullah said.

<a name="psfs">PSFs obligation and future of squash</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Majid Khan

While the Pakistan Squash Federation carries no responsibility for our 
players participation, so far as the super series and other tournaments 
controlled by the Professional Squash Association were concerned, but it 
certainly owes a national obligation to prepare teams for competing in the 
team and individual events under the auspices of the World Squash 
Federation, the controlling body of the game in the world of which Pakistan 
is one of the founder members.
 
The players are free to compete in the PSA tournaments, a good number of 
them carry rich prize money of over US dollars 50,000/- such as the British 
Open, World Open, Pakistan Open, Hong Kong Open, Mahindra Open, Alahram 
International and JSM Super Squash.
    
Besides the super series, other events, lesser in monetary terms, come 
under the bracket of major tournaments. For a few years a new trend has 
taken hold of international squash whereby as low as 10,000 dollars or even 
less prize money are offered for the players seeking to improve their 
rankings. In these events world ranking stars and other renowned players 
usually do not compete.
    
But the host country feels happy if its world ranking players do compete in 
the lesser tournaments for it considerably helps in improving the 
competitive standard of others and also provides an opportunity to play 
against the top players of the world.
    
Last year four PSA approved international tournaments were held in 
Pakistan, two in Lahore, and one each in Peshawar and Wah. Jansher Khan, 
Zubair Jahan, Zarak Jahan, Mir Zaman Gul competed in the tournament. 
Besides them a number of up-and-coming players, including those who 
competed in the Juniors World championship as also, a good number of 
foreign players.
    
By holding such tournaments the squash activities in Pakistan had gained 
further momentum and this year it would be helped our new generation of 
players to improve their skill.
    
The Pakistan Squash Federation, it is gathered, had almost finalised the 
1997 domestic calendar and is expected to be announced next month, after 
getting it confirmed from the organisers of the events.
    
The PSFs first international commitment is the participation of Pakistan 
in the eighth Asian Juniors Championship, scheduled in the Indian City of 
Madras from Feb 14-22. During the nine-day tournament both boys and girls 
individual and team championship would be held. The PSF is sending two 
girls as part of the Pakistan contingent.
    
Pakistan has also entered for the first time in the World Doubles 
Championship to be staged in Hong Kong from May 4-11 this year.
    
Preparations for the World Doubles squash immediately requires holding of 
competitions at Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi and Rawalpindi or Islamabad on 
courts bearing standard dimensions to develop understanding among the 
players. The PSF too can follow this practice for the Hong Kong Doubles as 
the time is running out. The event would be staged five weeks after the 
conclusion of the first super series British Open in Cardiff, Wales on 
April 6. All the Pakistans world ranking stars would be on the 
international circuit.
    
Holding the doubles tournaments on all Pakistan basis considered essential 
and the PSF should take necessary steps ensuring at least four events 
before a camp is organised for selection of the national team. The PSF has 
to work out its doubles programme in a way that it does not clash with 
leading players participation in the PSA tournaments.
    
It would be more appropriate that technical committee be appointed for 
running the doubles tournament and the rules of the doubles game be made 
known to the players before starting a tournament.
    
Another important event in which Pakistan has also entered is the World 
Games which includes Squash as well. The World Games include those sports, 
which are not included in the Olympics games. The World Squash Federation 
is making persistent effort for the games inclusion in the Olympics and 
inclusion of squash in the World Games is a step forward in achieving the 
desired goal. The inclusion of squash in the 1998 Asian Games has been a 
major achievement and would give tremendous boost to the Game in Asia. The 
World Games, according to the announced programme of the WSF, is scheduled 
from Aug 13-17 at Lathi, Finland. Both men and women teams events would be 
contested on the Olympic pattern.
    
Pakistans World Champion Jansher Khans participation, along with other 
leading players of the world such as Australias Rodney Eyles, Peter Nicol 
(Scotland), Englands Chris Walker and Simon Parke, Jonathan Power 
(Canada), Egyptian Ahmed Barada, Australias Brett Martin, Englands Del 
Harris and Pakistans Zubair Khan, being among the world top ten players, 
would brighten the squash chances for inclusion of squash in the future 
world Olymics.
    
The last event in which Pakistan is fully committed to take part is the 
World Team Championship, to be followed soon after the World Open is 
starting from Nov 4-9 at the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. The World Open 
is PSA event and the PSF has nothing to do with this super series event for 
it is up to the players to compete in this rich prize money tournament. The 
PSFs concern is with the team championship as it is under the domain of 
the World Squash Federation to which it is affiliated. The professional 
Squash Association is an organisation of players, belonging to different 
countries including Pakistan.
    
The WSF 1997 calendar is very demanding on the part of the Pakistan Squash 
Federation both in term of its financial needs as well as team preparations 
for the coming tournaments.
