<a name="pres">Presidency refutes allegations</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 24: A spokesman for the presidency has said that 
Ardeshir Cowasjee has made frivolous and baseless allegations 
against the president in his article `The Crowing Losers' published 
in Dawn on Nov. 23.
    
The spokesman said the gravamen of Cowasjee's allegations against 
the president is that "his concentration has been on doing all that 
he considered was necessary to gain him a second term." He said 
nothing could be more ludicrous than this argument and added that 
had that been the case the president would not have taken some of 
the major decisions in the supreme national interest.
    
The spokesman said that the president had and would in future, too, 
uphold the responsibility and the dignity the high office enjoined 
on him.  As for the allegation about the sale of land in Dera Ghazi 
Khan and "re-acquisition of 29,000 acres of land in Leghari 
Barkhan," the spokesman said that clarifications in this connection 
had been issued on numerous occasions earlier. 
   
The president's share was under 15,000 acres of mostly `ghair 
mumkin' and `banjar qadeem' land and not 29,000 acres as alleged. 
He, however, reiterated that the case of land surrendered in 1972 
was under dispute with the government of Balochistan and later 
under litigation in the high court. It was decided in favour of the 
petitioners by the Balochistan High Court on merit, the spokesman 
pointed out.
    
Referring to the allegation about the sale of land in Dera Ghazi 
Khan the spokesman said the matter was examined in-depth by a high-
powered judicial commission which, in its report, had exonerated 
the president from any misdemeanour.
    
Mr. Cowasjee has also alleged that the president's job is one long 
holiday. The spokesman said the entire nation knows - and surely so 
does Mr. Cowasjee - how the president has assiduously promoted 
Pakistan's vital interests including its security matters, 
development of human resources, science and technology, 
agriculture, industry and the economy generally. However, Mr. 
Cowasjee may be nursing grudges against the president for not 
acceding to his unfair demands concerning appointments in the 
Karachi Port Trust during the caretaker period (Nov. `96 - February 
1997), the spokesman concluded.

Raja Zulfikar

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 25: The army stated that it was helping to resolve 
the constitutional crisis, but denied it had any political demands 
or power-sharing plans.
    
An ISPR spokesman said the army had acted in the national interest 
to "gain respite from the headlong rush into an irretrievable 
constitutional crisis" but clarified it had no political ambitions.
    
In a formal reaction to newspaper reports, the spokesman said: "The 
onus of resolving the present crisis is essentially on the state 
institutions." He dismissed the impression that there were any 
demands on behalf of the army for revival of the Council Defence 
and National Security (CDNS) or any other forum like it.

Saleem Shahid 

QUETTA, Nov. 26: A division bench of the Supreme Court held the 
appointment of Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in abeyance till 
further orders and restrained him from performing judicial and 
administrative functions.
    
The Quetta bench of the apex court comprising Justice Irshad Hassan 
Khan and Justice Khalilur Rehman Khan passed a short order, as an 
interim relief, on a constitutional petition filed by Malik Asad 
Ali, a resident of Quetta, challenging the appointment of the chief 
justice.
    
The bench also held in abeyance the operation of the notification 
of June 5, 1994 issued by the president appointing Justice Sajjad 
Ali Shah as the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
    
The bench admitted the petition and fixed it for regular hearing on 
Nov. 28. It issued notices to all the respondents - the federation 
of Pakistan through secretary law, justice and parliamentary 
affairs, the President of Pakistan and the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan.
    
The apex court bench issued notice to the Attorney-General for 
Pakistan as the matter involved interpretation of the provisions of 
the Constitution.

<a name="verd">Verdict declared illegal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 26: The Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Sajjad 
Ali Shah, declared the order of the two-member Supreme Court bench 
at Quetta "without lawful authority", and directed the assistant 
registrar, Quetta registry, not to fix any case before the two 
judges till further orders.
    
Justice Shah, whose appointment as the chief justice was held in 
abeyance by the two-member bench, continued working as the chief 
justice of Pakistan.
    
In his order the chief justice observed that under Order XXV of the 
Supreme Court Rules, 1980, a petition under Article 184(3) under 
the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was to be filed only 
at the principal seat and not at any other registry.
    
"In this respect there are orders and directions that if any such 
petition under that provision (Article 184(3) is filed at any other 
registry, it is to be forwarded straight-away to the principal seat 
for orders to be obtained from the chief justice for its fixation 
before a proper bench," the CJ said.
    
He observed that if any orders had been passed in that petition 
they should be deemed to have not taken effect for the reason that 
proper procedure had been followed.
    
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah further stated that even registration 
number could not be given to such petitions at the registry without 
the permission or express orders of the chief justice. The CJ 
directed that the record of the above mentioned petition may be 
summoned immediately from Quetta Registry for placement before him 
for further orders in this respect.
    
Justice Shah further observed that "honourable" judges present at 
the Quetta registry had acted without lawful authority and directed 
the assistant registrar of Quetta registry not to fix cases before 
them for disposal until further orders.
    
It is the second instance in the judicial history of Pakistan when 
two judges of the Supreme Court have been asked not to perform 
their duties. Earlier in 1996, two ad hoc judges of the Supreme 
Court were asked by the same chief justice not to perform their 
judicial functions after the March 20th judgement.  They were late 
Justice Munir A. Khan and Justice Mir Hazar Khan Khoso.

<a name="legh">Leghari declines to act on govt. advice  </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent 

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 26: President Farooq Leghari refused to sign a 
summary moved by the federal government for the appointment of 
Justice Ajmal Mian as acting chief justice of Pakistan.
    
The sources said the federal government had sent a summary to the 
president in the light of an order by a two-member bench of the 
Supreme Court working at Quetta registry.
    
The federal government had advised the president to appoint Justice 
Ajmal Mian, the most senior judge, as acting chief justice, because 
the post of the chief justice "has fallen vacant after suspension 
of the government decision of appointing Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as 
chief justice of Pakistan."

The sources said the president consulted his legal aides and 
refused to sign the summary for the appointment of an acting chief 
justice on the ground that he was not bound to act on the advice of 
the prime minister.
    
President Leghari was of the opinion that Article 180 of the 
Constitution was among those Articles in which the words "in his 
discretion" were not there, but on the reading of which it was 
evident that power conferred on him was to be used independently. 
No official was ready to talk.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 26: The Supreme Court received a petition asking 
the court to send a reference against Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah 
to the Supreme Judicial Council for "having committed high 
treason," the Registrar of the Supreme Court confirmed.
    
A well-drafted petition filed by an unknown lawyer, Mr. Asad Tariq, 
asked the court to void the Judicial Officers Protection Act of 
1850 or any other law giving immunity to a judicial officer for 
being inconsistent with Article 25 of the Constitution. He further 
asked the court to direct the federal government to file a 
complaint against the chief justice for "having committed high 
treason."
    
He contended that the executive-judiciary row had halted economic 
progress and that the initiation of contempt of court proceedings 
against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif were aimed at ruining the 
economy.

<a name="news">News about judiciary Senators criticize PTV handling</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 27: Minister of State for Information and Media 
Development Mushahid Hussain Syed told senate that PTV had highest 
regard for judiciary and it was the responsibility of the PTV to 
provide news correctly and in true perspective.
    
He made this observation over criticism made by some senators on 
the way the PTV telecast news in its bulletin by splashing the 
ruling of the Quetta Bench of the Supreme Court in headlines but 
giving insignificant space to subsequent ruling of the Chief 
Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah of the Supreme Court at Islamabad in 
its night bulletin.
    
He said it was deliberate attempt to present the ruling in a 
particular light. He deplored that it left an information gap which 
would affect credibility of the PTV. Senator Taj Haider also 
criticized the handling of the news and accused the government of 
giving one-sided coverage.
    
Defending the PTV news policy the Information Minister said the PTV 
was a national institution which believed in telling "the truth and 
nothing but absolute truth." He claimed the government did not 
interfere in the placing of news as it had left this function to 
the professionals in the PTV as they best know how to go about 
their job. There was no political angle in how they carry news, he 
claimed.

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 27: Two high-level meetings at the Aiwan-i-Sadr 
here failed to resolve the political crisis.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that army chief Gen Jehangir Karamat had 
not so far come up with a solution acceptable to Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif and Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah.
    
Officials at the President House said President Farooq Leghari had 
not sent back to the government the written request to approve the 
appointment of an acting chief justice.
    
"The president is still meeting the prime minister, the COAS and 
the CJ but nothing has so far come out", said a spokesman for the 
President, Mr. Salim Gul Sheikh.
    
 "All I can say to you is that the president has not returned to 
the government its request to approve the appointment of an acting 
chief justice", the spokesman told newsmen.

<a name="quet">Quetta bench overrules CJ's order</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

QUETTA, Nov. 27: The Quetta bench of the Supreme Court has held 
that the impugned executive order of the Chief Justice is nullity 
and is to be ignored.
    
The order was passed by a three member bench comprising Justice 
Nasir Aslam Zahid, Justice Irshad Hasan Khan and Justice Khalilur 
Rehman on a petition filed by Mrs. Ashraf Abbas Advocate on Record 
late on Wednesday evening.
    
The court further said that the "order passed by a bench of two 
judges of this court at Quetta on Nov. 26, in C.P. No. 248-Q of 
1997 still holds the field and is hereby reiterated and confirmed."
    
Mr. Mohammad Aslam Chishti who is Advocate on Record in Malik Asad 
Ali's case in which the Quetta bench of Supreme Court had suspended 
the Chief Justice of Pakistan on Wednesday appeared on behalf of 
the petitioner.
    
ORDER RULED OUT: The bench also over-ruled the executive order of 
Chief Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah regarding not fixing the cases 
before it.
    
When the proceedings of the court started, it was pointed out to 
the bench that a fax has been received from Chief Justice Syed 
Sajjad Ali Shah with the direction to the Assistant Registrar, 
Quetta Registry that no case should be fixed for hearing before the 
said bench until further orders.
    
One of the senior judge observed that it is "misconduct on the part 
of Chief Justice as none of the Supreme Court judge can be 
restrained from the work on executive order and said that judicial 
order had already suspended the Chief Justice to perform his duties 
as Chief Justice."
    
The full bench after ignoring the orders of the Chief Justice 
disposed off 10 cases. These cases were fixed before the bench by 
Advocate General Balochistan and counsels of different petitioners.
    
ASAD CASE: The Quetta bench of the Supreme Court will hear the 
petition of Malik Asad Ali on Friday in which he challenged the 
appointment of the Chief Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah as Chief 
Justice of Pakistan.
    
The division bench of the Supreme Court had already admitted the 
petition for regular hearing suspending the notification about the 
appointment of Chief Justice Syed Sajjad Ali Shah issued by the 
President on 5 June, 1994.
    
The court had also ordered the Chief Justice of Pakistan that he 
should not perform his judicial and administrative duties as Chief 
Justice till the decision of the said bench regarding the petition. 
Notices in this regard had been issued to Attorney General, Deputy 
Attorney general and others.

PESHAWAR, Nov. 27: The Supreme Court's circuit bench at Peshawar 
endorsed the verdict of the Quetta bench on a petition challenging 
the appointment of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as chief justice of 
Pakistan.
    
Justice Mukhtar Ahmed Junejo declined to sit on the three-member 
bench, following which the other two members, Justice Saeeduz Zaman 
and Justice Fazle Elahi Khan, admitted the petition and ordered 
that notices be issued to the respondents - the chief justice, 
Sajjad Ali Shah, President Farooq Leghari and the attorney general.
    
The court further ordered that since several important questions 
relating to the interpretation of the Constitution have been raised 
in the petition the full court, excluding Justice Sajjad Ali, 
should hear the petition. It, however, declined the petitioner's 
request of issuing interim injunction restraining the chief justice 
from performing his functions.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz vows to fight till victory</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 27: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has termed the 
current crisis as "very critical", declaring he would fight till 
the victory of "the democratic forces". Reiterating his stance that 
"the people of Pakistan have given me the mandate to serve them," 
he said he would continue to serve the people "without caring for 
reward or punishment".

The prime minister claimed whenever he wanted to do something for 
the country, vested interest turned against him to block his move. 
He asked, "Have I done anything wrong if got adopted the Anti-
terrorists Act to punish the terrorists and subversive elements? 
Should I be blamed for trying to curb sectarian violence which is 
spreading in the country like cancer!"
    
He regretted that the foreigners in Pakistan were being killed 
every now and then. He referred to the recent killings of the 
Iranians and the Americans and said, "Should I give up and go home? 
No, this is not going to happen. I will do my duty without any fear 
of the consequences."
    
The prime minister said it was his desire that the courts should 
impart timely and inexpensive justice. He was of the view that 
unless criminals and terrorists got severe punishment, the violence 
and growing rate of crime could not be stopped. Nawaz Sharif said 
there were so many problems which could not be resolved overnight 
and that the government needed time and support of all the people.
    
Citing the law and order situation in Karachi, Nawaz Sharif said 
Pakistan's biggest city was experiencing unmanageable problems. He 
said the situation in other cities was also bad and called for 
making serious efforts at the government's as well as the people's 
level.
    
He expressed hope that the current crisis would be over soon, 
allowing him to fulfill his economic agenda which is aimed at 
bringing prosperity throughout the country.
    
The prime minister pointed out that the adverse law and order 
situation was a serious issue and it had to be given top-priority. 
He said the lives and property of the citizens was no longer safe.

Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 28: Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah requested the 
president to take steps to post army or paramilitary soldiers in 
the Supreme Court building, and at the residences of the chief 
justice and other judges hearing the contempt case against Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif.
    
In his letter Justice Sajjad Ali Shah narrated the incidents which 
took place in the court on Thursday and Friday. He stated that 
during the hearing of the contempt case against the prime minister 
and others, certain advocates stooped to rowdiness. He said some of 
the intruders were overheard saying that they wanted to take the CJ 
hostage.
    
The case was adjourned and the judges were taken to the chamber of 
the chief justice under police escort. He said after Thursday's 
rowdy scenes in the court room, he had directed the registrar to 
issue passes only to people concerned as usually government 
supporters jam-packed the court. The chief justice further said 
several people had informed him over telephone that a BBC report 
about the attack showed policemen doing nothing to stop the mob.
    
He said when court officials present at the gate asked the police 
as to why they were not preventing the crowd from entering the 
premises, they replied that since most of the protesters were 
government supporters, they were helpless.
    
Justice Sajjad said films were available with court officials to 
show how big the crowds were and how they broke into the court 
room. He further said court officials told him that when the mob 
was dispersing, they heard announcements that arrangements had been 
made for lunch at the Punjab House.

<a name="sind">Sindh High Court urges CJ to form full court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied 

KARACHI, Nov. 28: A division bench of the High Court of Sindh 
requested the Chief Justice of Pakistan to convene a full court 
meeting of the SC, to be chaired by himself, to consider the 
controversy surrounding his appointment.
    
The bench issued the order on a petition filed by Mr. Haider Iqbal 
Wahniwal. The bench consisted of Chief Justice Wajihuddin Ahmad and 
Justice Raja Qureshi. The court issued notice only to the President 
of the Sindh High Court Bar Association (Mohammad Ali Sayeed) to 
assist the bench as amicus curiae.
    
The petition will be put up before the bench after being served on 
the amicus curiae and a copy of the order and the petition will be 
dispatched to the Registrar of the Supreme Court.
 
The petitioner, Mr. Haider Iqbal Wahniwal, son of Mohammad Ishaque, 
of 2/40, Al-Yousuf Chamber, Karachi, has cited the following as 
respondents: the Government of Pakistan through the secretary, 
ministry of law, justice and parliamentary affairs; President 
Farooq Ahmed Leghari; Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Chief Justice 
Sajjad Ali Shah.
    
The petitioner urged the Sindh High Court to declare the actions of 
President Leghari and Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah against their 
oath and detrimental to the government, the parliament and 
institutions created through the constitution. The petitioner also 
asked the court to declare the appointment of the chief justice as 
violative of the law. He further asked the court to declare the 
administrative actions of the Chief Justice of Pakistan and the 
recent elevation of five judges as illegal.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Nov. 25: There is no hope of getting F-16s from the US and 
Pakistan is left with no option but to approach a court of law to 
obtain the aircraft or the price it had paid for them to Washington 
in advance.

This was stated by Defence Secretary Lt-Gen (retd) Iftikhar Ali 
Khan, who had recently gone to the United States to negotiate the 
issue. The defence secretary said first the US kept the F-16s in 
the "short storage" and then shifted them to the "long storage," 
leaving no chance of their delivery to Pakistan.

When asked to explain which court Pakistan might approach for 
getting the aircraft or the money paid, he said it could be the 
International Court of Justice or a court in the US.

Mr. Khan said the US had been denying the aircraft to Pakistan 
because "they are after our nuclear program. But, I have told them 
that our nuclear program is for our survival and there is no chance 
of giving it up."

<a name="judg">Judge agrees to order winding up of Taj Co</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Nov. 25: The Lahore High Court company judge has agreed in 
principle to order winding up of the collapsed Taj Company, which 
is being run by a board of administrators appointed by the court 
since 1990.

Two associations of the depositors of the company, which had been 
carrying out banking business in violation of the law and its own 
memorandum of association, are seeking its transfer to them. One of 
the associations has been registered recently.

Justice Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the LHC company judge, promised full 
hearing of the Taj victims' point of view, but doubted whether 
under the Companies Ordinance, the court has any power to transfer 
a company instead of appointing liquidators for it.

In any case, Justice Qayyum said, he would make an order on the 
winding up petition filed by the joint registrar of companies and 
the corporate law authority.

Advocate Naazar Khan, who is one of the three administrators of the 
collapsed company, said the liabilities of Taj at the time of its 
takeover in 1990 stood at Rs 2,550 million. They have now been 
brought down to Rs 2,400 million by repaying 20 percent of the 
deposits received by the company. Its assets, the lawyer said in 
reply to a question, amount to Rs 520 million.

Justice Qayyum observed that the assets were `peanuts' compared 
with the liabilities and apparently the administrators would never 
be able to satisfy the claims of the depositors. In such 
circumstances, the court can only order liquidation and it is for 
the government to lay down a policy in respect of the refund of 
victims' stuck-up deposits.

The judge asked Deputy Attorney-General Khwaja Saeeduz Zafar to 
make his submissions on the powers of the court after the companies 
registrar has made a request for winding up and the rival claims of 
the depositors.

<a name="oppo">Pakistan opposes move for NPT ratification</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 23: Pakistan, India and Israel were in unison 
opposing Japan-sponsored resolution on Nuclear disarmament at the 
United Nations last Wednesday because it stipulated ratification of 
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT).
    
The Japanese resolution - nuclear disarmament with a view to 
completely eliminating nuclear weapons - was adopted by a vote of 
143-3 with one abstention in the first committee which deals with 
issues of international peace and security.
    
The only three negative votes were from Pakistan, India and Israel, 
while Cuba abstained. The explanations given by the representatives 
of the three countries for negative votes were similar.
    
The operative stipulation of the resolution which called upon 
states not parties to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty -like 
India, Israel and Pakistan- "To accede to it (NPT) at the earliest 
possible date, recognizing the importance of universal adherence to 
the treaty." 

Explaining Islamabad's reservations, Pakistan's envoy at Geneva 
Munir Akram pointed out that the Japanese resolution did not 
"renounce the doctrines of nuclear deterrence and nuclear threat 
espoused by some nuclear weapon states and military alliances." He 
said the resolution "instead of addressing nuclear disarmament, 
focuses on nuclear non-proliferation", which was unacceptable.
    
Akram stressed that the negative developments taking place vis-a- 
vis the nuclear weapons program of the declared nuclear states were 
also not taken into consideration in the Japanese draft.
    
These were:
    
- the assertion by some nuclear weapons states that they will 
continue to retain nuclear weapons indefinitely,
    
- the continued testing of nuclear weapons, under the cover of 
programs ostensibly meant to keep weapons reliable.
    
- the development of new nuclear weapons for actual use in war,
    
-the approval of war fighting doctrines envisaging the use of such 
weapons, against nuclear, and non-nuclear weapons state,
    
-the threats held out of the possible use of nuclear weapons 
including against non-nuclear weapon states, in case of the use of 
threat of use of other weapons of mass destruction's,
    
-the extension of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence to expanded 
and renewed military alliances.
    
He said that Pakistan made several proposals to reduce nuclear 
weapons and called for a step-by-step approach with a time frame, 
but none of its proposals were ultimately included in the final 
draft.
    
Pakistan's efforts were seconded by several countries including 
India and Israel. However, at the end, when the vote was taken only 
three voted against and Cuba abstained.

<a name="imoa">IMO asks DIG for censorship list of mail</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Nafisa Hoodbhoy

KARACHI, Nov. 22: The International Mail Office has recently 
written to the DIG Karachi asking for the censorship list of mail 
that they may give for screening to the Intelligence Bureau and 
Special Branch officials - after finding them increasingly involved 
in removing foreign currency from mail sent by post.
    
According to the IMO administration, the Special Branch officials 
posted here open a maximum of 250 articles daily, without seeking 
permission about the items that they may open. In addition, IB 
officials carry away over 50 articles daily, leading the 
administration to express its helplessness.
    
According to the sources, the union has become involved in passing 
on bundles containing currency by representatives giving the 
package a "special kick" after recognizing that it contained money. 
This procedure, they maintained, has become common ever since the 
Special Branch sat inside a room with a postal representative, with 
a financial arrangement worked out to keep each side happy.
    
A still worse racket was reportedly flourishing at the Local 
Sorting Office where lack of surveillance was enabling the Special 
Branch officials to seize on bulky looking Karachi packages mailed 
from the US and the UK, after passing through the post office in 
Islamabad. While the customs staff had earlier this year been 
sharing the same room as the Special Branch officials, sources 
said, they no longer shared the screening of mail with the 
intelligence staff.
    
Postal authorities said that since the Special Branch officials had 
of late begun opening more than 250 articles, the postmaster-
general, Nusratullah Khan had issued instructions to the post 
office not to allow the Special Branch to open more than their 
prescribed limit. However, according to these sources, more 
effective measures are needed to stop the extraction of currency, 
including making the censorship list available to the post offices 
and introducing transparency in the opening of packages by the 
IB/Special Branch police.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 28: Central Board of Revenue has withdrawn 10 
Customs and Sales Tax notifications issued between the period of 
May 1983 up to September 1996.
    
These notifications are SRO 539 (I)/83 of May 31, 1983; SRO 4 
(I)/85 of January 1, 1985; SRO 96 (I)/85 of February 5, 1985; SRO 
1185 (I)/88 of December 21, 1988; SRO 1186 (I)/88 of December 26, 
1988; SRO 468 (I)/90 of May 26, 1990; SRO 1078 (I)/96 of September 
30, 1996; SRO 1079 (I)/96 of September 30, 1996; SRO 1117 (I)/96 of 
September 30, 1996; and, SRO 1118 (I)/96 of September 1996.
    
These notifications pertain to Survey & Rebate and in line with the 
federal government's policy of reducing the import rebate duty 
rates. The notifications now rescinded had previously allowed rates 
which do not match the requirements of the policy now adopted, 
stipulating the reduced duty rates followed by slashed rates of 
rebate repayment.
    
The CBR, in its presentation on the issue to the ministry of 
finance had argued that the rebate refund rates be slashed for all 
the sectors enjoying reduced tariff rates announced since May 1997, 
which were incorporated in the federal budget for 1997-98 with 
another round of reducing the import duty and sales tax rates.
    
The note to the ministry from the CBR says: More than 400 duty 
drawback notifications are in existence. Major commodities being 
exported from Pakistan such as textiles, leather, carpets, sports 
goods, surgical goods, tents and tarpaulin, shoes etc, are covered 
by these notifications.

<a name="mone">Money supply up by Rs32bn in July-Oct.</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Nov. 22: A monetary expansion of around Rs 32 billion by 
the end of October last may frustrate the government efforts to 
beat inflation particularly if political uncertainty goes on.
    
A State Bank document reveals an increase of Rs 31.973 billion in 
total money supply (M2) during the first four months of the current 
fiscal year - from July 1 to October 25 to be precise. A massive 
increase of Rs 28.533 billion in net foreign assets is the main 
contributor to this huge monetary expansion which shows rising 
dollarisation of the economy. Domestic credit expansion was 
recorded at Rs 3.440 billion only.
    
The monetary expansion during the first four months of 1996-97 is 
many times more than a meager expansion of Rs 1.164 billion in the 
same period in 1995-96. Up to 27th September, 1997 the net foreign 
assets had grown by only Rs 113 million. Many a banker feel this 
has a linkage with the October 15 rupee devaluation by 8 per cent 
amid feelers of further devaluation that lured numerous savers to 
convert their rupee accounts into dollar accounts. They also link 
it to raising of foreign currency funds last month by such state-
run organizations as CEC and WAPDA.
    
The SBP document reveals that domestic credit expansion rose by Rs 
3.440 billion during July 1 to October 25 against that of Rs 58.263 
billion in the same period last year. It shows that the public 
sector borrowing grew by Rs 11.428 billion but borrowing by the 
private sector and public sector commercial enterprises saw a 
negative growth of Rs 2.598 billion and unclassified items of 
borrowing also went down by Rs 5.391 billion. That was how the 
overall domestic credit expanded only by Rs 3.440 billion during 
the said period.
    
Up to September 27, public sector borrowing stood at Rs 13.243 
billion but it had almost no impact on total domestic credit 
expansion because the private sector and public sector commercial 
enterprises together retired a debt of Rs 13.015 billion instead of 
borrowing more during July-September. Only the unclassified items 
of credit expansion saw a growth Rs 1.429 billion thereby pushing 
the total domestic credit expansion to Rs 1.659 billion.
    
According to the 1997-98 credit plan, the public sector can borrow 
up to Rs 66 billion - Rs 58 billion meant for government borrowing; 
Rs 5.5 billion for financing commodity operations and Rs 2.5 
billion earmarked for autonomous bodies. The plan has allocated Rs 
82 billion for the private sector including PSCEs.

KARACHI, Nov. 22: Any positive outcome of new investment policy is 
being ruled out by business community as long as the political 
instability coupled with law and order situation looms large.
    
Chairman, Site Association of Industry, Shoaib Munir told Dawn that 
the government had once again given no indication of providing a 
constitutional cover for the new policy. He said the policy, 
despite covering every sector, lacked incentives for attracting 
investment in the infrastructure development.
    
Shoaib said the Site area, comprising more than 2,500 small to 
large-sized units, had not witnessed any organized investment for 
last many years due to various reasons. He said it was strange that 
political stability was hanging in the balance since the government 
had come into power.
    
Chairman, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry, Akbar Farooqui 
told this correspondent that the government had again not assured 
that no further notifications or SROs would be issued after the 
policy. He said the government planned an investment of Rs 3,700 
billion in the Ninth Five Year Plan (1998-2003), three times more 
than Rs 1,100 billion earmarked for 1992-97 Plan.

<a name="text">Textiles: biggest industry, heaviest liability</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

A MAJOR reason for the varying but persistent economic crisis in 
Pakistan is the ever-ailing textile sector. The largest industrial 
sector of the country has become its heaviest liability, instead of 
becoming its primary asset.
    
In spite of the large concessions given to the textile sector by 
every government, including frequent devaluation of the rupee which 
destabilize the economy, the net contribution of the industry with 
450 textile mills to the economy is very small.
    
It is a very poor tax-payer, the largest defaulter in repayment of 
bank loans, gives poor or no dividends to minority share holders, 
is guilty of varied malpractice's in the employment sector and is 
too slow to modernize and go for the value-added exports instead of 
low price products which often face anti-dumpling charges abroad.
    
The lowest foreign exchange earner is cotton yarn. And yet out of 
503 mills installed 18 are spinning yarn while 32 are waste-
spinning mills. And it is doubtful whether some of the spinning 
mills are earning more foreign exchange or losing more if all the 
imported inputs in to the industry are taken into account.  And if 
to add to that the exporters have to pay anti- dumping charges as 
in Japan earlier and now in the European Union the whole things 
becomes a tragic comic exercise. But the remarkable performance of 
some textile mills which produce quality products, sell to top 
buyers abroad, earn large foreign exchange and pay pretty good 
taxes shows what other mills too can do so.
    
These few mill-owners are committed to the growth of the industry 
and helping the country. But these are few islands of excellence. 
The country needs far more of them in a highly competitive world 
textile market but the industry is too slow to reform and put 
itself on a fast-growth track.
    
The failure of Pakistan's textile industry becomes too apparent 
when compared with Bangladesh which is able to export thrice as 
much garments as Pakistan does. Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz 
underscored this lamentable feature of the industry when he 
addressed businessmen recently. For all that, Bangladesh imports 
cotton and also some fabrics, while Pakistan has everything 
beginning with cotton and infinite supply of yarn and fabrics.
    
Even in the garments export sector while much is being exported at 
very low prices there are rare examples of excellent exporters 
whose products sell at high prices abroad. A cotton garments 
exporting company tells me it had entered into arrangements with 
Fifth Avenue, New York, department stores to sell its shirts at 
over $100 a piece. 
   
The textile industry in Pakistan as a whole is said to earn 60 per 
cent of the export earnings, but that share is falling. Last year 
out of the total exports of $8.2 billion, textile exports were for 
$4.5 billion and in the preceding year out of total exports of $8.7 
billion, textile exports were worth $4.5 billion and the year 
before they were $4.3 billion. 
   
That means textile exports are getting to be rather static instead 
of achieving a 20 per cent growth as they can. However, the 
industry is not focusing on quality growth and exporting more of 
the value-added. Instead it is focusing on the getting more and 
more concessions from the government, including frequent 
devaluation of the rupee to make exports cheaper.
    
In fact that most militant voice in the industry is that of the 
spinners as they are very large in number and organized under the 
All Pakistan Textile Mills Association as a mighty pressure group 
and getting their way most of the time.
    
Garment exporters earned $600 million last year-July to April-
marking an improvement of 27 per cent over the same period in the 
preceding year the scope for increasing these earnings is far more 
with the right official assistance is plenty, but the garment 
exporters are not well organized and do not have much political 
clout or financial leverage.
    
The latest demand of APTMA is that the no-duty and no-refund should 
also cover polyester staple fibre.  And it came out with large 
advertisements in newspapers to press its claim.  But the polyester 
makers countered that claim saying that polyester fibre was 
available in plenty within the country and its prices were 
competitive with that of India which APTMA quotes as an example.
    
The fact is APTMA chiefs avoid holding Press conferences or come 
out with proper studies of their problems.  They do not like being 
questioned by the Press in detail. Annual reports of APTMA once 
made available to Press regularly also seems to have become a thing 
of the past. Instead they opt for advertisements in newspapers and 
argue that way they are able to say what they want, get the kind of 
headlines and display they choose and have their advertisement 
right on the front pages of newspapers. But since that has become a 
habit such advertisements at a high cost carry small weight with 
the government.
    
The new chairman of APTMA Jehangir Elahi said at the largely 
attended Golden Jubilee Textile Conference in Lahore this week the 
government had made no genuine efforts to remove the bottlenecks in 
the development of the textile sector.  He asserts the government 
had paid no heed to developing upstream and downstream industries 
of the sector which had increased production cost and made its 
exports non-competitive.
    
The story of all the textile mills collectively paying less income 
tax than the ICI is well-known.  Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who 
owns several textile mills had told them in Karachi after becoming 
the Prime Minister last time that while the mills should have paid 
over Rs 2 billion as income tax they paid just Rs 160 million, 
after paying Rs 250 million the year before.
    
While the textile sector has 450 mills, unlike in India, it has 
made no serious efforts to manufacture machinery.  In fact, it did 
not encourage the two textile machinery manufacturing plants set up 
in the 1970s. Now a shuttleless loom is being manufactured by the 
private sector with South Korean collaboration.  But the general 
preference is for importing machinery because of the large 
kickbacks usually obtained from such imports and kept abroad.
    
Now at a time when the country should be importing the latest 
machinery to achieve increasing value-added in its exports, very 
little of such machinery is being imported as the banks are not 
liberal with the loans to the defaulting industry and some of the 
banks are trying to check the actual prices of the machinery.
    
In such a situation an experts committee set up by the government 
in July last years with the former chairman of the Atomic Energy 
Commission, Mr. Munir Ahmad Khan as its chairman, come up with 
comprehensive recommendations for reforming and upgrading the 
industry and enabling it to export more of the value-added.    He 
had the assistance of 26 experts and sub- committed for each 
sector.
    
What the country needs now is a textile commission comprising 
representatives of the government and all sectors of the industry 
to take the final decision and come up with a five-year strategy 
which can make the mills meet the exactings demands of ISO-9000 and 
then ISO 14,000. 
  
There is no time to be lost and the perennial tug-of-war between 
the APTMA with its habitual negativism and the government must come 
to an end. We also need a separate foreign exchange budget or 
account to ascertain whether the country gains or losses more of 
foreign exchange through the textile sector and determine what can 
be done to improve the situation. We also need an annual monetary 
and fiscal profile of the industry, inclusive of the taxes paid by 
it and loans received by it, so that we can sift the truth from 
falsehood.

<a name="gulf">Gulf money props up financial sector</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Muhammad Aslam

THE STEADY inflow of Gulf money into Pakistan's financial sector in 
the recent past might not have rung alarm bells in the western 
banking circles but it certainly points to a major breakthrough 
judged in the perspective of typical local conditions and the state 
of economy.
    
Pakistan needs money from any quarter to boost its corporate sector 
and to break the current sluggishness on the industrial front after 
luring prospective sponsors back into the arena and if it comes 
from the Gulf it is more than welcome, said a leading banker. The 
major thrust of the Gulf investors is on the banking sector for 
obvious reasons. The perception behind it appears to make it a 
viable launching pad before moving out to the industrial sector.
    
"After having bought Schon Bank last month at Rs 23 and Women's 
Bank during the current month at Rs 28 per share, Gulf investors 
are awaiting the bid dates for Habib, United and National banks," 
banking sources said. But unlike the current turmoil in the local 
banking sector there is no post-sell-off right-sizing or 
downsizing, which reflects the confidence of Gulf investors in the 
local talent
    
Gulf investors have already a big stake in the banking sector both 
as sponsors and equity shareholders in about a dozen investment and 
commercial banks including Al-Faysal Investment Bank, Faysal Bank, 
International Investment Bank and Al-Towfeek Investment Bank, 
having combined paid capital of more than Rs 2 billion.
    
Out of about four dozen commercial and investment banks including 
foreign ones, investors from the Gulf own over a dozen banks, which 
means literally they are among the `big three' local, foreign and 
Gulf having an equal stake.
    
In addition, they have also invested massively in Modaraba and 
leasing companies over the last one decade, most of them are 
earning concerns despite being taxed at the corporate rates after 
early exemption.  "About $2 billion Gulf money is floating here. A 
half as a long-term investment as sponsoring companies and a half 
is a floating capital ready to find its way where needed," said a 
chief executive of a Gulf bank.
    
The newly appointed senior executive vice-president of Pak- Kuwait 
Investment Company, Zafar Aziz Osmani who has already worked in top 
executive positions in Exxon Pakistan and American Express Bank and 
is a well-known banker says, "Pakistan is a second home for the 
Gulf money as there are no inhibitions or reservations on the part 
of investors from there."
    
Pak-Kuwait Investment company, which along with Islamic Investment 
Company of Gulf, Bahrain(IICG), Kuwait Auqaf Public Foundation and 
Islamic Development Bank and Saudi Pak is setting up here one of 
the largest investment bank, has the dominant position among the 
Gulf investors as its financial stake is much bigger than many 
others.  "Al-Meezan Investment Bank will be the premier Gulf bank, 
having the biggest paid-capital and working capital and could well 
prove nerve centre of financial transactions between Pakistan and 
the Gulf region," Zafar Osmani who has been entrusted with the job 
to preparing corporate structure for the new bank said.
    
The management will, along with other new products compatible with 
the modern banking system, try to develop a workable mode of 
Islamic banking here in a bid to rope in a sizable section of 
religious minded small savers in its fold, he added.
    
"We plan to snatch our share from the $80 billion global banking 
system from our new base in Pakistan and that is not a wild guess 
but is the 21st century strategy," Mr. Usmani says. "The Gulf money 
perhaps is the only one, which do not go by political developments 
in Pakistan and any adverse local event could hardly check its 
inflow," the chief executive of another leading Gulf bank who was 
not inclined to be identified said.
    
The Gulf financial perceptions about the Pakistan economy and its 
corporate culture seldom worry investors from there and what is 
more important is that their "overwhelming confidence in Pakistani 
talent," he added. He said the Gulf money thus plays a dual role in 
Pakistan financial sector. 
   
On the one hand it lines up funds, not the `hot money' for long-
term investment and employment opportunities to the talented 
jobless but well-qualified persons on the others.

<a name="asia">Asian Bank concerned at political turmoil</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 24: The Asian Development Bank (ADB), which is 
providing 250 million dollar loan for Capital Market Development 
Program, believes that the growing political uncertainty could 
hamper the proposed CMDP in Pakistan.
    
It said although the present government enjoys a majority in the 
Parliament, which allows for smooth passage of the policy and 
legislative reforms, political expediencies could threaten the 
macroeconomic stability, given the vulnerability of the fiscal 
deficit and balance of payment positions.
    
The second risk, the ADB believed, stems from the potential 
opposition of vested interests. For instance, members of the stock 
exchanges may resist the tightening of corporate governance 
standards, market integration through automation and the 
centralized clearing and settlement systems, and tightening of the 
rules and regulations that would curb insider trading and other 
irregularities.
    
The third risk relates to the lack of capacity within the 
government to undertake the desired policy reforms in a timely 
manner. Finally, CMDP includes a set of legislative reforms 
pertaining to company affairs and the securities market as well as 
the insurance industry.

<a name="shed">Rupee sheds 45 paisa; forex down by $215m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Nov. 27: The foreign exchange reserves dropped by $215 
million to $1.406 billion; the rupee lost 45 paisa to a dollar in 
the open market; the rate of forward cover shot up by 2% to 8.25% 
and international trade experienced a slow-down.
    
According to a State Bank report, forex reserves fell by $215 
million to $1.406 billion on November 22 from $1.621 bn on November 
15. Bankers and financial analysts link the fall-the biggest one 
during the second quarter of the current fiscal year -to sliding 
inflow of foreign currency funds and increasing capital flight.
    
The bankers say the rate of forward cover that stood at 6.00- 6.25% 
a fortnight ago rose to 8.00-8.25 % on Thursday adding one per cent 
rise was recorded within last two days only. The State Bank rate 
for forward cover remained intact at 8.25%.
    
After shedding 20 paisa, the rupee lost another 20 paisa to a US 
dollar in the open market as the supply of the greenback fell and 
its demand increased. At the end of the day the rupee was quoted at 
45.35 and 45.45 to a dollar for spot buying and selling. Official 
buying and selling price of a dollar remained pegged to the October 
15 level of Rs 44.05 and Rs 44.27.
    
Inquiries at large local and foreign banks revealed that the crisis 
has apparently hit the external trade also which is evident from 
the a decline in the opening of LCs for imports and delay in 
meeting export commitments.
    
Bankers estimate a fall of around 50% in the number of the import 
LCs opened during last one week but they do not offer detailed 
statistics. They further say that many of their clients in the 
export sectors are not meeting their export commitments in the wake 
of the ongoing crisis coupled with an economic turmoil in the Asian 
region. 
   
No figures again. Inquiries further show that conversion of rupee 
accounts into dollar accounts is also on the rise in apprehension 
of a further devaluation.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Muhammad Aslam

The KSE 100-share index after breaching the barrier of 1,700 points 
at one stage to touch 1,687.79 points, finally managed to finish 
partially recovered at 1,750.08 points as compared to 1,784.95 
points a week earlier.
    
The market capitalization after hitting the six-month low at Rs 
517.461 billion managed to finish recovered around Rs 533.010 
billion as compared to Rs 542.128 billion a week earlier. However, 
unlike the previous, some of the leading shares managed to recoup 
initial losses under the lead of Fauji Fertilizer and Adamjee 
Insurance, which rose by Rs 2 to Rs 4.25.  Other good gainers were 
led by Orix Leasing, Mehmood Textiles, Knoll Pharma, Pak-Suzuki 
Motors and Askari leasing, which recovered one rupee to Rs 1.50, 
the biggest gain of Rs 5 being in Knoll. Pak Apex Leasing, Gadoon 
Textiles and Ferozsons Lab also attracted good support at the lower 
levels and finished partially recovered amid active trading. 

The biggest rallies, however, were noted in PIC, which rose by Rs 
75, Shell Pakistan Rs 27, Engro Chemicals Rs 12.70 and Hub- Power 
and PTCL Rs 2.45 and Rs 1.95 respectively on heavy covering 
purchases at the weekend session. But PSO remained under pressure 
throughout the week and suffered sharp fall on persistent selling.
    
Energy shares came in for renewed heavy selling under the lead of 
Hub-Power, which showed a fresh decline of Rs 1.25 on 126 million 
shares followed by Pakistan Refinery and Lever Brothers, which 
suffered decline ranging from Rs 2 to Rs 9.50. Network Leasing, 
Kohinoor Textiles, Rupali Polyester, KESC, BOC Pakistan, Reckitt 
and Colman, Cherat Paper and Shezan International also attracted 
active selling at the still higher levels and suffered fall.
    
Trading volume was maintained on the higher side thanks to heavy 
covering purchases at the weekend sessions, rising to 340 million 
shares. Both Hub-Power and PTCL were massively traded in each 
session both ways as after initial liquidation, investors covered 
positions at the lower levels, enabling them to recoup some of the 
initial losses. Together with ICI Pakistan, they accounted for 
about 230 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, 
Southern Electric, Japan Power, Kohinoor Energy, Sui Northern, Sui 
Southern, and PSO. Bank shares finished partially recovered under 
the lead of Bank of Punjab, MCB, Schon Bank, Bank Al-Habib and some 
others, accounting for large volumes and so did most of the 
chemical shares and Pak-Suzuki Motors and some others.
    
DIVIDEND: Honda Atlas Cars cash 5 per cent, Hashimi Can 40 per 
cent, Confidence Modaraba 10 per cent, Leather-up 15 per cent, 
Pakistan Paper Products 25 per cent, Al-Towfeek Investment Bank,

KARACHI, Nov. 27: The KSE 100-share index, showed a fresh modest 
decline of 10.68 points at 1,772.24 as compared to 1,782.92 a day 
earlier. Losers led gainers by 62 to 44, with 36 shares holding on 
to the last levels. The total market capitalization also fell by Rs 
2.468 billion from overnight's Rs 540.468 billion to Rs 538.017 
billion as the highly capitalized shares fell on renewed selling.
    
Price changes were mostly fractional, reflecting the absence of 
leading sellers and buyers, and as a result traded volume fell to 
27 million shares from the previous 60 million shares.
    
The most active list was again topped by Hub-Power, off 45 paisa on 
14.693 million shares, followed by ICI Pakistan, easy 20 paisa at 
Rs 21.20 on 7.819 million shares, and PTCL, lower 25 paisa on 0.373

Big gainers were led by Jahangir Siddiqui & Co and IGI Insurance, 
ICP SEMF, Bank Al-Habib and Shell Pakistan, which posted gains 
ranging from Rs 1.50 to Rs 10.
    
Lever Brother Pakistan and PIC, falling by Rs 20 to Rs 45, led the 
list of losers followed by Confidence Modaraba, Dawood Leasing, 
Adamjee Insurance, Nagina Cotton, BOC Pakistan and Pakistan 
Refinery, which suffered decline ranging from Rs 1.15 to Rs 4.
    
DEFAULTING COMPANIES: Only Haydery Construction came in for stray

<a name="thec">The crowing losers</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

KARACHI, Friday, November 21, noon: At the moment, all the losers, 
President Farooq Leghari, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, leader of 
the opposition Benazir Bhutto, and all our parliamentarians, all 
the fallen ones, may well believe that they have won, they may well 
crow. the real losers, the sufferers, we the people, cry.
    
Helpless as we are, we can only hope beyond reasonable hope that 
these mountebanks and zanies of patriotism have learnt some sort of 
a lesson. We know it is a false hope because it is greed, 
arrogance, and ignorance that form the foundations on which these 
men stand and from which they operate. These three afflictions, 
when combined, are triply lethal. The parliamentarians jointly and 
severally, incessantly hypocritically bleep on and on about the 
`Supremacy of Parliament,' which to the people simply means, `Jo be 
ho, hamaari dookaan nahi bund hona chahiye.'
    
What has nine months with these patriots bequeathed to the country?
    
There are now, since February, 3.3 million more hungry mouths to 
feed, a galloping two-digit inflation, a destroyed stock market, a 
shattered economy, lowered investment confidence, a devalued rupee, 
and greater indebtedness. All the fresh investments that have come 
in are for fried chicken and chips, fried hamburgers in buns, and 
over baked pizzas. Such investors bring in one dollar and take out 
six, and in the bargain deprive many people of this country of 
their meager livelihood.
    
Let us list the individual achievements of these fallen men and 
women, with their particular and peculiar motives and intentions - 
their `niyat' and their `irada' - whilst in office in the service 
of the nation.
    
President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari was elected by the members of 
our six houses with a resounding majority, all considering him to 
be the best suited of the bunch. He has been, to say the least, a 
disappointment. From Day One, his concentration has been on doing 
all that he considered was necessary to gain him a second term. He 
cannot be blamed. His job is one long holiday, and he is now left 
with no responsibility. He has lots of attendant pomp and 
vainglory. However, he is a total waste of money. To keep him in 
the style to which he has become accustomed, it costs the nation in 
the region of Rs 3.5 million per day, and a whole lot of 
unaccountable invisible perks and privileges. No known person of 
substance has claimed or taken possession of the land he is said to 
have sold in faraway Dera Ghazi Khan for which he was paid by 
Karachi townsman Yunus Habib. Apart from that, he managed the 
reacquisition of 29,000 acres of land in Leghari Barkhan which he 
had voluntarily surrendered to the 1972 land reforms. Other acts of 
commission and omission remain unexplained. Had he unselfishly 
dissolved the assemblies in 1994 rather than in 1996, would we not 
have been solvent today? His weaknesses stand exposed. Fortunately 
for him, the attempt made last week by Parliament to impeach him 
misfired.
    
The only good so far done by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is the 
restoration of Sunday as the weekly holiday, the conversion of 
wedding feasting orgies into receptions, the thinning of the ranks 
of the marriage food industrialists, and the making of the right 
noises towards India.
    
On the debit side: He has subverted and attempted to destroy the 
judiciary, fostering dissent amongst the ranks of our judges. His 
attempt to rush through the 15th Amendment had to be aborted, as 
will his misadventure into the realm of invoking the provisions of 
Section 8(5) of the Contempt of Court Act.
    
He has deliberately and purposefully canceled his programmed 
census. He has indulged in midnight legislation, amending the 
Constitution and making laws to enable him to rule with absolute 
power and to perpetuate that rule.
    
Of great concern is the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). Contrary to his 
agreement with the Chief Justice of Pakistan as to the methods of 
the trial of terrorists, he created a parallel judiciary, 
disallowing a man his right to appeal to the High Courts and the 
Supreme Court and prohibiting the special appellate tribunals from 
granting bail. He has made a mockery of Macaulay's Evidence Act, 
and has given unfettered powers to a lowly corrupt policeman to 
shoot and kill on mere suspicion of an anticipated act of 
terrorism. A draconian law drafted by, it is said, Abbaji's 
personal legal adviser, the former judge and now a Senator, Afzal 
Lone.
    
Suspending rules of debate, Nawaz rushed through the 13th 
Amendment, emasculating the president and increasing his hold on 
the Service chiefs. Where his `niyat' clean, and his `irada' to do 
right by the people, he and his mandate could well have sailed 
through their five-year term, living with half a dozen Article 
58(2)(b)s without ever attracting the dreaded provision.
    
He struck again in the same manner, rushing through the 14th 
Amendment, supposedly to prevent defection but in the bargain also 
prohibiting dissent or abstention from voting. He chose his own 
people in his parliamentary party, who constitutionally must be 
honest and clean. By this amendment, he implicitly admitted that 
the chosen were capable of selling themselves to the highest 
bidder. However can he claim an overwhelming mandate and still fear 
`lotaism'?
    
Today Nawaz also stands accused of misusing his power as chief 
minister of Punjab and giving away valuable state land - 5,000 
plots. He and many of his cohorts and cronies stand accused of 
having manipulated the banks for their own profit.
    
He has been in politics since 1985, and cannot claim to be immature 
or `innocent' of its art and science. He cannot be excused. He 
stands exposed, he stands accused of contempt of court. We can no 
longer afford to support him merely on the basis of his being the 
last but one, the lesser of the two evils.
    
The wrong and harm done to the country by Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, 
honorable leader of the opposition, does not bear repeating. We 
know it too well. She has robbed and plundered and rendered the 
nation bankrupt. The Swiss cannot be influenced by media trials. 
She (and her party) did not oppose the 13th or the 14th Amendment 
as both were to her advantage. Why did her talk- show specialists, 
Cambridge Chaudhry Aitzaz and Rabbani, remain silent? Many endorse 
co-columnist Irfan Hussain's comment that her party needs her as 
much as a fish needs a bicycle. She has failed not only as head of 
government but also as opposition leader. The outside world is 
slowly discovering exactly what she is, slowly shedding its 
infatuation with her youth, charm, glib talk, and slick PR.
    
There are two others of importance, two non-losers, who have held 
their ground.
    
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah may have his faults, and he may in 
the past have made errors of judgment, as we are all prone to do. 
But on this last issue he was, and still is, on high moral ground. 
He has not dithered in his resolve. Apart from the contempt case, 
he has on his anvil the ATA and the two amendments. He can justly, 
fairly and squarely strike down all three. Since 1988, when was 
Article 58(2)(b) ever abused? If at all, the fault lay in its 
belated invocation.
    
COAS General Jehangir Karamat heads the most disciplined, most 
powerful `party' of the land. His strength lies in his knowledge of 
the weakness of his army and its inability to govern us and get us 
out of the present mess. He knows when to sound the call.
    
Now to the system. We must accept that even if we start educating 
our people from tomorrow, the better part of the population will 
still be voting with their feet for the next fifteen years. During 
this period, we will be misgoverned by ignorant, arrogant, 
obstinate people. We must have a system with multiple checks and 
balances. Bankrupt as we are, we cannot be governed by absolute 
laws and rules, and we cannot afford the luxury of being ruled by 
Dracos and their absolute whims and fancies. Even before the 13th 
and 14th Amendments, the system was inadequate. Sooner or later 
(and we must hope sooner) there will have to be an interim 
government of no more than ten good men and true, whose motives and 
intentions - `niyat' and `irrada' - can be trusted, who can be 
given sufficient time to have unlimited non-selective Ehtesab 
before Intekhab. Guilty politicians, with guilt hanging over their 
heads like halos, cannot govern.

<a name="thep">The prospects for a turnaround</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.B. Naqvi

WHILE ordinary folks are reduced to discussing the survival of the 
state, more sophisticated observers of the national scene talk 
about turning around Pakistan and are ostentatiously promoting 
optimism. It all sounds so officious.
    
The fact is that the country is drifting primarily on the 
intellectual plane. Enthusiasm to be noted at grassroots is 
characterized by narrow group loyalties: all kinds of sectarian 
prejudices are uppermost in many people's minds; the more extreme 
among them are sometimes ready to kill their countrymen. Elsewhere 
it is tribalism of various sorts while various kinds of ethnicity-
based nationalism's are keeping Pakistanis effectively divided and 
mentally polarized. Nation-building, if anyone ever undertook it, 
has succeeded only very partially.
    
But need we despair? Pakistan enjoys certain advantages. it does 
not face serious external threats. One is aware of the much- 
propagated view that India has not accepted the partition of the 
subcontinent and would eventually undo Pakistan. But the kind of 
India that has emerged from 50 years of independence is more 
narrowly Hindu and obsessively concerned with caste. It has no use 
for the territories that are peopled so solidly by the Muslims - 
Pakistan and Bangladesh.
    
An Akhand Bharat was at one time the dream of the Hindu- majority 
India. But to the majority of high caste Hindu community in 
northern India today it would seem to be a nightmare. In the 
changed context, they would do nothing to imperil the survival of 
Pakistan and Bangladesh. Insofar as major foreign powers are 
concerned, there is near total unanimity that the states of 
Pakistan and Bangladesh ought to be preserved in conditions of 
peace, stability and internal harmony. This is a tremendous 
advantage. Such threats as do exist spring from inside.
    
Pakistan is certainly engulfed in well-identified crises. The 
immediate one is economic, although it is primarily one of balance 
of payments. No doubt, it is a complex phenomenon and it has many 
causes that go to the very basics of the economic management. But 
all its dimensions are being constantly discussed and the country 
has entrusted, more or less, its fate to IMF and World Bank 
experts. Doubtless, it is a very dangerous thing to do. All the 
indications are that our establishment is thinking in terms of 
handing over at least the running of the economy to the 
multilateral agencies. Although one disagrees with all the possible 
versions of that notion profoundly, there is unlikely to be any 
effective opposition. Here it is necessary to take note of the 
crisis and the establishment's trend of thought about what is 
likely to happen.
    
The major cause of the basic political crisis is the peculiar 
social, political and economic evolution of this country's 
governance. It resulted in the cornering of power primarily by a 
narrow social and economic elite within the very first decade, with 
the collapse of democracy and the take-over by the army chiefs 
coming in its wake. We all know the denouement of this trend: the 
1971 civil war and the third war with India resulted in the 
dismemberment of the country. The highlight of the politics of the 
entire period was the extraordinary emphasis placed on the disputes 
with India, particularly over Kashmir, leading to an 
extraordinarily rigid national budget structure in which the 
highest priority went to military build-up to cope with India, 
while the civilian priorities like improving economic conditions 
and removing disparities of incomes in East Pakistan and working 
toward social justice everywhere were ignored.
    
Politics at the federal level comprised unending rhetoric of 
Islamic solidarity and brotherhood while practising over- 
centralization with a clear view to rejecting the demands of the 
poorer and more backward regions for social justice - as also for 
more egalitarian distribution of incomes among social classes. That 
is how regional nationalism's were born and grew stronger and 
stronger. In the majority province of East Pakistan it created what 
is called the East Pakistan crisis. But the ethnic minority areas 
in West Pakistan had their own newly-born nationalism's that were 
sympathetic to the grievances and demands of East Pakistani that 
eventually led to the 1971 civil war in the eastern wing.
    
The Pakhtun, Baloch and Sindhi nationalism, it is important to 
recognize, owe their birth to over-centralization policies, 
frequent suppression of political and democratic rights, 
repudiation in theory and practice of the federal principle and the 
combination of anti-democratic and elitist economic and taxation 
policies with arbitrarily determined priorities in public finance. 
Political rhetoric and the refrain of national unity and Islamic 
solidarity were cynically used to prop up despotism, and hide all 
manner of political, social and economic discrimination against the 
large majority of the people in both wings of the country, although 
the sense of injustice deprivation and discrimination in the 
eastern wing was understandably stronger and widespread. It is this 
situation that spawned tragedy of 1971.
    
But politics in the post-1971 period has not been fundamentally 
different. It is also largely characterized by the same old factors 
and motivation as if the experiences of that traumatic year had no 
significance at all. Policies of over- centralization have not 
changed much. The same old ruling elite has continued to rule. 
Although for a longish period, almost 18 years, emphasis on Kashmir 
disappeared largely because of the 1971 debacle, the national 
budget structure has not changed significantly.
    
In fact, military spending increased, as did the size and strength 
of the military establishment, together with an increase in perks 
and allowances. No other major policy change can be discerned 
except Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's bureaucratic nationalization 
policies which were certainly a departure from the set pattern. But 
the aberration was quickly corrected, though major nationalized 
industrial units and banks have continued to remain the state 
sector because it suited the non-democratic elite groups.
    
In the subsequent period under Gen. Zia the centre's policy was 
what it had always been during Ayub Khan or Yahya Khan or even 
earlier, with some additions. The social and economic policies were 
essentially laissez faire, overlaid with a lincence-permit 
patronage system, especially during Gen. Zia's period. Zia's 
martial law was particularly brutal and more rightist than any 
previous right-wing regime. Zia's period was remarkable for 
proliferation of all kinds of fissiparous tendencies, including the 
sectarian parties and militias, along with new ethnic nationalist 
parties and groups. As a result, Sindhi nationalist groups 
proliferated and the people began to be polarized by sectarian 
slogans, while the air in Sindh was rent with the slogans of Sindhi 
and Mohajir nationalism's.
    
It was in this context that formal democracy was reintroduced in 
1985, though it was superimposed by Gen. Zia's extraordinary powers 
that he had extracted from his specially-elected non- political 
parliament. The social and political policies have undergone no 
change since. In the meantime, the economy had become even more 
vulnerable because almost all chicken of racklers borrowing and 
spending began coming home to roost and also because the successive 
governments since 1985 have been exceptionally weak.
    
The economy now requires constant infusion of loans and credits in 
order to get by from one day to another. This vulnerability has 
gone on increasing. Pakistan remains on the brink of default in 
external payments, with the economy in deep recession and suffering 
from high inflation and a very tight budgetary position obtains. 
The combination of weak governments and dangerous economic 
vulnerability can be deadly.
    
All kinds of sectarian parties have grown popular at the grassroots 
and are calling the shots over wide stretches in the north. Sindh 
and Karachi continue to remain divided within themselves over 
ethnic issues while it looks as if incitement and help from outside 
continue to stoke the fire of sectarian hatred and violence. The 
economy is lurching from crisis to crisis and the dominant mood, 
let us face it, is defeatist and pessimistic. That is the 
situation.
    
The question whether anyone can effect a turnaround remains 
unanswered. So long as the dominant elite's or the Pakistani 
political class, along with their basic social and economic 
policies, do not change, the state of the economy and the polity 
will remain troubled. The dominant mood will remain pessimistic, or 
get even worse. Unless the people of Pakistan throw up a new 
leadership with new visions, the hope for change and improvement 
with remain wishful.
    
In a situation of despondency and dispair, Islamic rhetoric 
provides a potent weapon for right-wing regimes in this country to 
mislead and confuse people and deny democratic rights to the people 
and to reject the demands for regional autonomy and sidetrack 
issues of economic betterment, equity and justice. The right-
wingers have triumphed in the name of Islam. Not only the left was 
wiped out but even formal liberalism has been sought to be snuffed 
out, though they have not succeeded entirely. A strong liberal 
opinion in the country has survived, especially in the press. But 
the fact that the religious and ideological confusion persists and 
indeed provides an excellent instrument to the right-wing to 
perpetuate its hold over the levers of power, bodes ill for the 
much talked about and badly needed turnaround, politically and 
economically.

<a name="thet">The tension ceases</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

IT WOULD take a brave man to say that the beleaguered government of 
Mian Nawaz Sharif is completely out of the woods but the sense of 
impending doom and disaster which had built up by Thursday evening 
certainly has dissipated. It was on that day that the government, 
feeling itself hemmed in from all sides, had decided to initiate 
moves to impeach President Farooq Leghari. It had arrived at this 
decision because of the perception that the President, by refusing 
to give assent to the amended contempt bill, had become a party to 
their distress. Mercifully, the government was saved from the 
consequences of its impulsiveness by the reported intervention of 
the army chief. There is no knowing what might have happened if the 
impeachment process had once been set in motion. Earlier that 
morning, the Supreme Court had passed an order which said that if 
the amended contempt law had been signed by the President it stood 
suspended and if it had not been signed then the President was not 
to sign it. This was the casus belli which had set passions aflame 
in the PML(N) parliamentary party, resulting in the decision to 
impeach the president. On Friday morning it was an indication of 
the easing of the situation that the Chief Justice granted an 
adjournment of a week in the contempt case being heard against the 
Prime Minister and a list of other respondents.

All what has happened has not cast any flattering light on the 
government which in recent days has made a virtue of blowing hot 
and cold and of adopting stout stands and then beating the hastiest 
of retreats. That this behavior has taken the last glimmerings of 
shine off its `heavy mandate' and damaged its credibility is 
perhaps of no consequence to anyone else. In the process, however, 
the government's repeated sallies into the dark have cost the 
entire country dear, because for the past month if not more the 
country has been gripped by a sense of crisis, with everything else 
being kept on hold as the stand-off between the government and the 
judiciary went from bad to worse. In the end it was not the wisdom 
or prudence of the Muslim League which contributed towards the 
easing of tensions but the shuttle diplomacy of the army chief.
    
If civilian leaders cannot sort out their own problems, what 
becomes of the notion of parliamentary sovereignty? Furthermore, 
can the protagonists of `controlled' or `guided' democracy be 
blamed if they continue to hold a dim view of the capabilities of 
the country's politicians? It is for Mr. Nawaz Sharif to sit back 
and take stock of the situation or rather of the narrow straits to 
which his vaunted government has been reduced. From the heady days 
of February to the repeated tremors of November there indeed has 
been a precipitous fall in the party's strength and fortunes. At 
the heart of this predicament lies the PML(N)'s inability to 
understand the limits of its power or to comprehend that the 
essence of democracy, not only here but wherever the creed is 
practised, is the dispersal of authority among the various branches 
of the state. It is this which creates a system of checks and 
balances, an arrangement conducive to stability and inimical of the 
despotism of one organ over every other.
    
Hopefully now, after having learnt a costly lesson, Mr. Nawaz 
Sharif will concentrate on essential tasks such as administrative 
reform and economic revival instead of frittering away his 
government's energies on non-essential matters. This is not to say 
that his travails in the Supreme Court have come to an end. The 
contempt case still has to play itself out fully. Besides, there 
are a couple of other cases which could prove troublesome for Mr. 
Sharif and his government. But the way to meet these judicial 
challenges is to fight them in court, with the weapons of the law, 
instead of thinking that the PML(N)'s brute majority in Parliament 
is an answer to every situation. If the events of the past few days 
have proved anything, it is this that the mere strength of numbers 
in a democracy is no substitute for restraint and discretion.

<a name="cris">The crisis persists</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

TO ANYONE watching Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif talking to the press 
on Monday, it would have been painfully obvious that the sense of 
relief felt by the nation as a whole after the Supreme Court gave a 
week's adjournment in the contempt case pending before it was all 
too premature. What we had seen was a temporary reprieve brought 
about, to the no small embarrassment of the country's democrats, by 
the intercession of General Jahangir Karamat. As the belligerent 
and defiant mood in the Muslim League parliamentary party on Monday 
vividly demonstrated, there are still no signs of this reprieve 
turning into something more enduring. The sentiment in the PML(N) 
parliamentary party still turns towards taking a tough approach 
towards both the President and the Chief Justice. Behind this 
sentiment lies the bitter feeling that while the government has 
been made to suffer a series of political reverses, there is no 
sign of flexibility coming from the other side. The President too 
is seen as having been unhelpful to the government. Hence the cries 
for his impeachment. In the background to all this lurks the 
thought that once again a conspiracy is afoot against the Muslim 
League government. From this to drawing dark parallels with the 
events of 1993 when Mr. Nawaz Sharif was compelled to step down 
from the prime ministership even though the Supreme Court had 
restored him to office is but a small step. The mood of defiance in 
the PML(N) parliamentary party is linked directly with this 
perception of conspiracy. Better to go down fighting than to suffer 
one humiliation after another.

What the PML(N) parliamentary party, or at least the hotheads in 
its ranks, appear to forget is that much of the troubles their 
government is facing are of its own making. In other words, this is 
not a crisis forced upon the Muslim League but one which it has 
largely created for itself. The greater onus for showing restraint 
and patience accordingly must also fall to its share. Admittedly, 
what the prime minister is facing in the Supreme Court is not an 
easy situation for him or his government. But the answer to this 
lies in submitting before the rule of law, uncomfortable as this 
notion must seem at present, instead of being swayed by the 
tantalizing but fallacious notion that the PML(N)'s strength in 
Parliament will serve to change laws and even the Constitution to 
suit the Muslim League's convenience. To instant legislation the 
Supreme Court has already made its attitude clear. What guarantee 
is there that more of this legislative haste will not meet the same 
fate?
    
That leaves the president. What purpose will the PML(N) achieve by 
initiating moves for his impeachment? Very likely such a step will 
imperil the very foundations of our existing democratic order. 
Impulsive behavior in any case does not sit well on the shoulders 
of a sitting government. It must show the patience and indeed the 
resolve to see this crisis through, both for its own sake and for 
the sake of the country at large which is being kept hostage to the 
high-rope drama being enacted in the capital. But if lectures on 
patience must be read to the Muslim League, other institutions for 
their part must respect the verdict of the electorate.
    
The mistakes that the prime minister may have committed does not 
take away anything from the fact that he continues to enjoy 
overwhelming support in Parliament. He has probably learnt his 
lessons (that he must not overstep the bounds of his office) the 
hard way. It is essential for others too to imbibe the lesson that 
any crisis of power will have a destabilizing effect upon the 
country. Restraint, therefore, must be shown by all concerned, by 
all the protagonists in this drama. Meanwhile, the PML(N) would be 
doing itself and the nation a favour by not embarking upon any more 
instant and thoughtless legislation. It would do no good and just 
might lead to a great deal of harm.

<a name="fall">Pakistan falls from grace in world squash</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Lateef Jafri

It was a poignant ending for Pakistan in the World Open, the most 
sought-after honor for players belonging to the upper echelon of 
global squash, and the biennial team championship.
    
Pakistan had shared the ultimate accolade in the World Open since 
it was instituted 22 years ago and it had clinched the honours since 
1981 through the demolition work of Jahangir and Jansher. Pakistan 
had not fallen as low as sixth since its successful appearance in 
the team championship in 1977 and later the Khans' magical strokes 
and glorious assaults gave pleasure to the connoisseurs in all 
corners of the globe wherever this high intensity and energy-
oriented squash competition was organized. The squash squad has 
made a return journey empty-handed. No official of the game, based 
in the country, has come out with any comment, though one finds 
that the manager has lauded the efforts against comparatively 
stronger opposition of the younger members of the competing set.
    
Would Jansher's presence have made a world of difference in the 
morale, resilience and strength of the team? The answer to the 
question is `yes' with the rider that if another sponsor was 
available and the competitions were staged at a venue other than 
Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital. No doubt Jansher had quelled 
the challenge of the Australian Chris Dittmar at the same place 
with felicitous ease in 1989 and had lifted the World Open trophy. 
But it was different occasion; the setting and atmosphere were 
pleasant. This time the situation was a different one. A lawsuit 
was pending in the Malaysian court with Jansher's divorced wife, 
Violet (Rukhsana) Soh, demanding maintenance money for, as she 
claims, the squash wizard's son, Kamran. Jansher feared arrest on 
entering the Malaysian soil for Rukhsana wanted 800 pounds a month 
to be paid as alimony or 70,000 American dollars to be credited to 
her account. This was the legal condition for Jansher's entry in 
Malaysia and participation in the two prestigious squash contests.
    
The temperamental and moody Jansher spurned all help the indigenous 
squash federation wanted to extend to him officially and 
diplomatically. The matter may have been sorted out but the amount 
to be given was too high, which only Jansher could have agreed to 
provide. The mishandling of the issue, led to Jansher's failure to 
appear in the World Open for a new record and sad fall from 
acclivity of the country in the team game.
    
It is to be seen if Jansher continues to maintain his top form and 
fitness to bag the next world title in the Indian port city to 
which the competition has been allotted. After having wrapped up 
the titles of the Hong Kong Open and the Egyptian Open in 
Alexandria he stumbled last month in Kuwait and lost to Peter Nicol 
of Scotland, his conqueror in the Al-Ahram contest in Cairo last 
June.
    
The squash wizard is set to play in Bombay in the Mahendra Cup, 
which he skipped last year. His form and bold forecourt play will 
be on test against the galaxy of world racket-wielders in India. 
Then comes the richly-prized Qatar Open and Cairo's Heliopolis 
contest before the new year heralds. Will he have the nerve and the 
quick reactions to go through the strains of the above competitions 
after the Kuala Lumpur tiff with his former wife. Even the feeling 
of a missed title, which he was reasonably sure to claim, may give 
him trouble mentally, if not physically. However, the great 
repertoire of strokes that Jansher has and the artful craftsman 
that he is it is difficult to deprive him of the triumphs and 
glory. He has, in the opinion of experts, to be wary and careful 
for at times he gets flustered.
    
As the latest world rankings for November have been released 
Jansher is still on top of the world and has a wide difference in 
the computer-calculated points. The ranking plus the deft and 
beautifully-timed shots would stand him in good stead in the 
upcoming programs. Regretfully no other Pakistani is in the first 
10. Even the improving Zubair Jahan Khan slipped to 15th from an 
earlier 10th which had given cause for hope for the future. If 
Zubair slumped internationally Mir Zaman Gul dropped further to 
35th.
    
Where was the improvement in the players? Some may point to Amjad 
Khan, a young and neat stroke-maker, but he is to go some distance 
to develop the sharpness and confidence to control matches and 
contain the powerfully-wristed strokes of his opponents.
    
Why Pakistan had a poor record in this year's World Open, ask the 
enthusiasts of the game? An unfit Zubair Jahan with hamstring and 
kidney trouble was found wanting to cope with the cunning tactics 
of South Africa's Craig Wapnick, given 33rd spot in the 
Professional Squash Association's listing, in the very first round. 
This was a heavy blow to Pakistan. Only Amjad Khan was to fight a 
lone battle in the singles event. He moved upto the pre-
quarterfinal, earlier settling the pretensions of Ireland's Derek 
Ryan after a five-game tussle. He played precise shots, often 
accelerated the pace to cruise home after a 76-minute see-saw 
battle. But the next encounter was against Canada's Jonathan Power, 
a quickly-moving and sound hitter of the black ball and having 
jumped to three in the global ranking. Certainly the task was 
tougher and it was beyond the capacity of Amjad to reply to the 
unsettling tactical variations of Power. Amjad lost the match, 
though the rallies, quite exhilarating, won him the appreciation of 
the critics and some of the foreign veterans.
    
It was tortuous for the squash fans to daily read the news of the 
country being thrashed in the team championship apart from the 
first day when Pakistan pipped Germany by 2-1 with Zubair going 
down to Simon Frenz due to physical injuries. As the competitive 
exercise progressed in Kuala Lumpur it was quite evident that the 
task was beyond and above the duo of Amjad Khan and Kumail Mahmud. 
It was, however, creditable that they stuck to the job upto the end 
even though the conclusion was sad and melancholic with Pakistan 
going down the hill, taking a sixth position. On the second day of 
the team event Canada blanked out Pakistan 3-0, then Egypt dumped 
it without conceding a match, South Africa ran out winners by 2-1. 
After being engulfed by a stream of troubles due to poor form of 
Zubair and his setback in the first match against Malaysia the 
young campaigners, Amjad and Kumail, saved the situation against 
Malaysia by what should be taken as wafer-thin margin of 2-1.
    
In the play-off for the fifth place South Africa, climbing the 
global squash ladder, as advancing in all games gave little chance 
to Pakistan and sent it to the poorest todate sixth spot. The 
country's fans can only express concern and consternation over the 
squash predicament. Minus Jansher it is perhaps a wide gulf between 
Pakistan and some of the rising powers, especially Canada, who have 
become a heavyweight in a few years, South Africa and Egypt, whose 
players introduced the game to England and Europe. Even Finland are 
a threat and the days are not far when Scotland will find more 
players, apart from Peter Nicol, to throw down the gauntlet to the 
rivals in the world team championship.
    
What Pakistan has to do for future is a million dollar question? 
The team is back, the officials may meet soon for detailed analysis 
of the reasons behind the setback in Kuala Lumpur. Where are the 
players to meet internationals challenge. If Jansher is not 
available and is not in proper physical shape to help the country 
earn laurels? If the new hands have the bustling vitality, the 
needed tenacity their strokes have to be honed for purposes of 
appearing in European, American and Oceanic circuit. The 
youngsters, Amjad and Kumail to name only two, are playing quite 
well but that is not enough. They have to mix their game discreetly 
with aggression, angles and drops. The important thing is to work 
for every point the hard way. Day by day the world level is going 
up and the challenge is growing. Let the squash federation and the 
Federal Sports Board arrange more coaching and then test the 
progression of the players with competitive rigors. Kuala Lumpur's 
descent must awaken our officials from slumber for more damage may 
be done.

<a name="waqa">Waqar Younis recalled for second Test</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, Nov. 25: Speedster Waqar Younis was recalled by the 
Pakistan cricket selectors for the second Test starting at 
Rawalpindi from Saturday.
    
Younis, a veteran of 46 Tests in which he has bagged 231 wickets, 
was surprisingly left out from the first Test which Pakistan won by 
an innings and 19 runs.
    
The selectors have picked Younis in place of Shahid Nazir who had 
the wickets of Stuart William's and Shivnarine Chanderpaul in the 
first innings of the Peshawar Test last week. But his inability to 
penetrate when the wicket eased out on the third day followed by a 
bruised toe led to his downfall. The selectors have also named an 
uncapped Shoaib Akhtar, Rawalpindi-born boy who represents ADBP in 
the Patron's Trophy.
    
The selectors have also named an unchanged top order batting which 
gives another opportunity to Aamir Sohail and Mohammad Wasim to 
score runs and cement their places for the future challenges.
    
The 13-member team is: Wasim Akram (captain), Saeed Anwar, Aamir 
Sohail, Ijaz Ahmad, Inzamamul Haq, Mohammad Wasim, Moin Khan, Azhar 
Mahmood, Waqar Younis, Mushtaq Ahmad, Saqlain Mushtaq, Shoaib 
Akhtar and Ali Naqvi.

shoulder earlier this summer.
    
When contacted in Islamabad where he is with the Pakistan side, 
Akram said his surgeon was very happy with the shoulder.  "He told 
me that it (shoulder) was progressing way ahead of time. He advised 
me about some exercises to be done for another two months which I 
will do with the assistance of Dr. Dan Keisal," said a jet-lagged 
Akram.
    
Akram said the exercises were basically to further strengthen the 
muscles around the shoulder. "He has given me another appointment 
in April."

Pakistan take the field in the second Test, starting from Saturday, 
with a chance to score a first ever series win against the West 
Indies.
    
Akhtar will partner Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Azhar Mahmood as
