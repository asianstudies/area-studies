<a name="naam">NA amends Contempt of Court Act</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 17: The National Assembly adopted, with a majority 
vote, a bill that amended the Contempt of Court Act, 1976, by 
providing an intra-court appeal against the orders passed by the 
Supreme Court to a larger bench consisting of all the remaining 
available judges of the court within the country.

The leader of the opposition Benazir Bhutto and a couple of other 
PPP MNAs opposed the bill. Just before the bill was put before the 
House for passage, the PPP members walked out in protest. They 
wanted to suggest some changes but the speaker ruled they could not 
do so because they had not formally moved their amendments to the 
bill.
    
The bill was earlier approved by a special cabinet meeting chaired 
by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and was thoroughly discussed in a 
meeting of the PML and its allied parties. The purpose of the bill, 
the special cabinet meeting said, was to bring the provisions of 
the Contempt of Court Act, 1976, in conformity with the injunctions 
of Islam.
    
The eminent constitutional expert, Syed Sharifuddin Pirzada, and a 
couple of other prominent lawyers are said to have been behind the 
preparation of the new bill to stop the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court Syed Sajjad Ali Shah to take any final decision 
against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and others involved in the 
contempt of court case that was heard today and was adjourned for 
Tuesday.
    
The bill passed by the National Assembly holds that an intra-court 
appeal shall lie against the issuance of the show-cause notice or 
an original order, including an interim order passed by a bench of 
the Supreme Court in any case, including a pending case, to a 
larger bench consisting of all the remaining available judges of 
the court in the country. It also provided that in the event the 
impugned show-cause notice or order has been passed by half or more 
of the judges of the Supreme Court, the matter shall, on the 
application of an aggrieved person, be put up for re-appraisal 
before the full court.
    
The bill further provides that "the operation of the impugned show-
cause notice or order shall remain suspended until the final 
disposal of the matter in the manner herein before provided...and 
...(ii) after sub-section (3) the following new sub-section shall 
be added namely:  "An intra-court appeal or application for re-
appraisal shall be filed within thirty days from the date of show 
case notice or the order, as the case may be".

<a name="appo">Appointment of chief justice challenged</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Saleem Shahid

QUETTA, Nov. 18: The appointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, was challenged in the Balochistan Bench of 
the Supreme Court.
    
The validity of the chief justice's appointment was challenged in a 
petition filed by Munir Ahmad.
    
The division bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justice Nasir 
Aslam Zahid and Justice Khalilur Rehman, which heard the petition, 
referred it to the chief justice for placing the matter before the 
full court for consideration.
    
The apex court bench in its order said: "After considering the 
submissions made, we are of the view that this matter requires 
urgent attention and decision by the full court.  In the 
circumstances, it is directed that this file may be sent to 
Islamabad for being placed before the honorable chief justice for 
placing the matter before the full court."

<a name="sena">Senate passes Contempt Bill</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 18: The Senate passed the Contempt of Court 
(Amendment) Bill, 1997, with a voice vote amid a walkout by the 
opposition over misinterpretation" of the Supreme Court and Federal 
Shariat Court verdicts on the issue of right of appeal by 
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Yasin Wattoo.
    
The bill was passed by a voice vote. The bill will now go before 
President Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari for assent. The Leader of the 
Opposition in Senate, Aitzaz Ahsan, and deputy leader Raza Rabbani 
argued against the bill.
    
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Mohammad Yasin Wattoo defended the 
bill, saying that it was in consonance with the verdicts passed by 
the Supreme Court, Federal Shariat Court and recommendations of the 
Islamic Ideology Council and provided right of appeal to aggrieved 
individuals and parties.
    
He defended the summoning of the two Houses, saying that it 
fulfilled the Islamic requirements of consultation on important 
issues facing the nation. He justified the suspension of rules of 
business and procedures of the House to meet an emergency. He said 
while every forum provided a right of appeal to an aggrieved party, 
there was no such recourse in cases relating to the Supreme Court.

<a name="scuf">Scuffle breaks out in Supreme Court precincts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 18: Exchange of hot words between Privatization 
Commission Chairman Khwaja Mohammad Asif, PTV Managing Director Sen 
Pervaiz Rashid and Advocate Akram Sheikh led to a scuffle in the 
precincts of the Supreme Court when the contempt case against Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif and his colleagues came up before the court 
for hearing.
    
It all began with an exchange of light taunts between the old 
buddies when in the heat of the moment their tempers snapped and 
they started hurling abuses at each other. Khwaja Asif gave two 
punches on Akram Sheikh's face. This left a scar on his face. "Take 
the picture", a baffled Akram Sheikh shouted at a photographer 
standing nearby. Some lawyers intervened and saved Akram Sheikh, 
who later raised the issue inside the court and narrated the whole 
story. He said he had invited Khwaja Asif and others to join him at 
tea.
    
Akram Sheikh said he called Khwaja Asif a corrupt banker and also 
admitted to hurling an obscenity. He said he had decided not to 
lodged any formal complaint with the police. He, however, called 
upon the Chief Justice to take note of the violation of the 
sanctity of court.

<a name="lhci">LHC issues notice to govt. on 'blank papers'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, Nov. 19: The Lahore High Court issued notice to the federal 
government in an application alleging that "the prime minister may 
use blank papers he got signed by the PML parliamentarians for 
moving an impeachment resolution against the president".
    
The application has been moved by Dr. Abdul Basit in a pending writ 
petition seeking that appointment of a permanent chief election 
commissioner by the president in his discretion. The petition, 
filed on behalf of the Lawyers' Front for the Protection of 
Constitution, says that the CEC will soon have to adjudicate 
disqualification references against the prime minister and certain 
ministers and it is in the propriety of things that a permanent CEC 
is appointed by the president under Article 213.
    
The federal government is already claiming that an acting CEC 
appointed under Article 217 will, like an acting chief justice, not 
enjoy all the powers of his office, alleges the petition.
    
The new application alleges that the PM got blank papers signed by 
his partymen in Parliament before the suspension of the anti-
defection 14th amendment. An impeachment notice or resolution may 
now be typed on these blank papers. It seeks a restraint order 
against the PM and a direction for scrutiny of the notice and 
resolution to ascertain whether they have been freshly signed by 
the movers.
    
Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum, who is seized of the main petition, 
directed Deputy Attorney-General Khwaja Saeeduz Zafar to obtain 
instructions from the government on the latest application also and 
place them before the court on Nov. 21 when the main petition would 
also come up for hearing.
    
According to Article 47 of the Constitution, notwithstanding 
anything contained in it the president may be removed from office 
on the ground of physical or mental incapacity or impeached on a 
charge of violating the Constitution or gross misconduct. Not less 
than one half of the total membership of either House may give to 
the speaker of the National Assembly or, as the case may be, to the 
chairman of the Senate a written notice of its intention to move a 
resolution for the removal or impeachment of the president. The 
notice shall set out the particulars of the charge against him or 
of his incapacity.
    
If the notice is received by the Senate chairman, he shall 
immediately transmit it to the NA speaker, who shall cause a copy 
of it to be transmitted to the president within three days. The 
speakers shall then summon the two Houses to meet in a joint 
session not earlier than seven days and not later than 14 days 
after the receipt of the notice by him.
    
The joint sitting may investigate or cause to be investigated the 
ground or the charge upon which the notice is based. The president 
shall have the right to appear and be represented during the 
investigation, if any, before the joint sitting. 

If, after consideration of the result of the investigation, if any, 
a resolution is passed at the joint sitting by the votes of not 
less than two-thirds of the total membership of Parliament 
declaring that the president is unfit to hold the office due to 
incapacity or is guilty of violating the Constitution or of gross 
misconduct, the president shall cease to hold office immediately on 
passing of the resolution.

<a name="nawa">Nawaz wants Leghari to sign bill immediately</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif linked the 
prevailing uncertain situation to the delay by President Farooq 
Leghari in giving assent to the Contempt of Court Amendment Bill, 
and added that "with his signature, we will be able to end the 
crisis."
    
He did not commit that the president had become a party but 
repeatedly urged Mr. Leghari to accord assent to the Contempt of 
Court Amendment Bill. Explaining the urgency of the president's 
assent to the Bill, the prime minister said: "I am facing a 
contempt case and the Contempt of Court Amendment Bill provides 
that if the Supreme Court decision goes against me (as it can go 
against any Pakistani), I should have the right of appeal as each 
Pakistani has. You know charges have been framed against me and we 
had passed the Bill so that we could go into appeal in the full 
court, if needed."
    
Mr. Sharif did not elaborate what his party would do should the 
president not sign the amendment Bill which had been sent to Mr. 
Leghari. In his informal press talk, Mr. Sharif showed a veiled 
resentment against the president whose delay in signing the 
amendment Bill was further complicating the issues.    

The prime minister did not give any answer when asked if the assent 
to the Bill would end the confrontation between the two 
institutions (judiciary and executive). What he said was: 
"Parliament has its own powers and we are empowered to take our own 
decisions."
    
The prime minister said the country was going through an 
extraordinary phase, the economy was under formidable threats, 
uncertainty was sitting heavy on everybody and the situation had 
become alarming. Asked if he had to go to jail, the prime minister 
replied: "I don't mind going to jail in the larger interest of the 
nation.

Mr. Nawaz did not disclose the details of his meeting earlier in 
the day with the chief of the Army staff, Gen Jehangir Karamat, and 
said these meetings were also a part of the system. Asked why he 
was so anxious to get for himself the right of appeal while the 
anti-terrorism law, which parliament under him approved did not 
give such a right to the people, the PM said this right was 
guaranteed in the said law. He denied the government was 
contemplating any proposal to reduce the age-limit of the judges 
and also contradicted press reports that he had contacted on phone 
the Army chief while the COAS was in London.
    
Asked if he thought there was a conspiracy against the system, the 
prime minister said: "What do you say on this?" He left it to the 
judgment of the people to decide whether it was a conspiracy 
because the nation was well aware of the whole situation.
    
The prime minister deplored that the country was being pushed on 
the path of destruction as far as economy was concerned. He said 
billions of rupees were being wasted daily and the past few weeks 
had done the country the damage which would take long to recover.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19: The Supreme Court chargesheeted Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif and eleven other respondents, including seven 
legislators, for their alleged commission of contempt of court.
    
The respondents would be required to either plead guilty or not 
guilty. The SC exempted the prime minister from personal appearance 
in the court. The chief justice said the court would summon the 
prime minister if required. All other respondents, including the 
law minister and chairman Privatization Commission, would be 
required to attend the court on every hearing.
    
The court told the respondents that they had "committed contempt of 
court which is an offense falling within the purview of Article 204 
(2)(b) of the Constitution and section 3 of the Contempt of Court 
Act, 1976, which is punishable under section 4 of the above-said 
Act and within the cognizance of this court. And we hereby direct 
that you be tried by us on the said charge."
    
The court again turned down the request of the prime minister's 
counsel for dropping the proceedings against his client because of 
his personal appearance in the court. He further said that his 
client, who was the prime minister of the country, had offered his 
regrets "if his remarks had hurt any judge."
    
All the respondents have been asked two questions: 1) Do you plead 
guilty? and 2) Do you have anything else to say?

<a name="pmla">PML and allies decide to impeach president</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 20: The government decided to impeach the president 
following his refusal to give assent to the Contempt of Court 
(Amendment) Bill, but later chose to defer the move for a day.
    
The decision to postpone the impeachment motion came after a 
cabinet session and separate meetings of Nawaz Sharif and his 
brother Shahbaz Sharif with Chief of the Army Staff Gen Jehangir 
Karamat.
    
Official sources told Dawn the government had opted for a ceasefire 
till Friday evening. It was also decided not to discuss the 
summoning of the chief justice in the privileges committee. The 
chairman of the privileges committee had earlier convened the 
session for Thursday which, too, was postponed.
    
A senior government spokesman told Dawn " things are moving towards 
resolution". He said the cabinet and the PML and its coalition 
partners had rejected the idea that the prime minister should step 
down and that some other party leader should be made leader of the 
house to avert the crisis.
    
Nevertheless, the sources said the names of Lt.-Gen Majid Malik and 
Syed Fakhr Imam and Ishaq Dar were being discussed in case Mr. 
Sharif decided to step down. The role of President Leghari was also 
discussed during the meetings. The president is reported to have 
told both the chief ministers of Punjab and the NWFP that the 
government should not expect anything unconstitutional from him and 
that they were welcomed to move an impeachment motion against him.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told reporters while going to preside 
over the parliamentary party meeting that he enjoyed full support 
of his MNAs and those of the allied parties and had been authorized 
to take any decision in the interest of the country.

<a name="scas">SC asks president not to sign bill</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 20: The Supreme Court directed the president not to 
give his assent to the Contempt of Court (Amendment) Bill, 1997, 
until the petitions challenging the validity of the bill were 
disposed of by the apex court.
    
The court also ordered that in case the president had given his 
assent to the bill before this court order at 10.45am on Thursday, 
the operation of the act would remain suspended until further 
order.
    
The order was passed by the three-member bench comprising Chief 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, Justice Bashir Ahmed Jehangiri and Justice 
Mohammad Arif on the petitions of Naveed Malik, President of 
Pakistan Solidarity Front, and Syed Iqbal Haider. The court also 
issued notices to the president of Pakistan, Federation of 
Pakistan, attorney-general and the law secretary to explain their 
positions.
    
The court after one-hour hearing ordered: "In the circumstances we 
deem it fit and proper to direct respondent No 1 (President of 
Pakistan) in Constitutional Petition No 43 of 1997 not to give 
assent, and if assent has already been given the operation of the 
Contempt of Court (Amendment) Act, 1997, is hereby suspended until 
further orders."
    
Iftikhar Gillani, counsel for Naveed Malik, argued that the 
Contempt of Court (Amendment) Bill, 1997, was passed to save 
certain individuals facing contempt of court charges in the Supreme 
Court. He submitted that the impugned legislation was violative of 
Article 191 and item 55 of the Federal Legislative List.
    
Article 191 gives the power to the chief justice to regulate the 
practice and procedure of the court. Item 55 of the Federal 
Legislative List reads as: "Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, 
except the Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in 
this list and, to such extent as is expressly authorized by or 
under the Constitution, the enlargement of the jurisdiction of the 
Supreme Court and the conferring thereon of supplemental powers."
    
Mr. Gillani argued that item 5 of the Federal Legislative List 
clearly stated that parliament had no powers to curtail the 
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and it could do legislation for 
enhancing its jurisdiction. Under the proposed law, he said, a 
convict and even an alleged contemner could file an appeal before 
the judges who were not members of the bench which was seized of 
the contempt matter, and mere filing of an appeal would result into 
automatic stay.
    
Mr. Gillani further argued that the bill passed by the parliament 
ran counter to the administrative powers of the chief justice as 
envisaged in the rules and provisions of the Constitution.

A three-member government team comprising Punjab Chief Minister

of the House in the Senate Raja Zafarul Haq, called on President 
Leghari and requested him to give his assent to the bill. However,

inability to sign the bill and said he did not intend to commit 
contempt by disobeying the Supreme Court.

<a name="parl">Parliament cannot summon CJ: Akram</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Shujaat Ali Khan

LAHORE, Nov. 21: Parliament has no power to summon any member of 
the superior judiciary, including the chief justice, for any reason 
or purpose under the Constitution of Pakistan, Supreme Court Bar 
Association outgoing President Muhammad Akram Sheikh said.

Talking to Dawn on his return from Islamabad after a week of 
eventful Supreme Court proceedings, he said the position was 
entirely different under the Indian Constitution, which empowers 
parliament to impeach superior court judges. A judge guilty of 
misconduct in the eyes of the government in Pakistan can only be 
dealt with under Article 209, which provides for inquiry and 
adjudication by the Supreme Judicial Council.

There is no corresponding provision in the Indian Constitution. But 
Indian parliament has used its power to impeach the superior court 
judges sparingly, probably only once. It was not exercised when 
Mrs. Indira Gandhi was unseated, or when certain constitutional 
amendments protecting her were declared ultra vires for being 
repugnant to the basic structure of the Indian Constitution, or 
even when corruption cases were started against leading 
parliamentarians. Mr. Akram Sheikh, who is appearing as amicus 
curiae in the contempt case against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, 
said Article 68 is quite categorical in prohibiting Parliament from 
even discussing the conduct of any judge. How can it summon a judge 
when it cannot even discuss his conduct in his absence.

IMPEACHMENT MOVE: Mr. Akram Sheikh said the Supreme Court can stay 
an impeachment move against the president if it has no nexus with 
the grounds mentioned in the Constitution for the president's 
removal — incapacity or gross misconduct.

As in case of the repealed Article 58 (2) (b) envisaging the 
National Assembly dissolution by the president if the 
constitutional machinery breaks down, the superior courts can 
assume jurisdiction to examine whether the grounds mentioned in an 
impeachment notice or resolution have any nexus with the grounds 
mentioned in Article 47 of the Constitution, he said.

Mr. Akram Sheikh affirmed that he always supported Article 58 (2) 
(b) and most other provisions of the Eighth Amendment as they 
provided for a system of checks and balances. The Supreme Court 
also upheld them as being in accord with the salient features of 
the Constitution — Islam, democracy and federal parliamentary 
system.

About the Supreme Court restraint order to the president, who has 
power to consider and return a questionable bill adopted by 
parliament within 30 days, Mr. Akram Sheikh said the court can 
intervene when a matter is patently outside the legislative 
competence of parliament. It is better to nip an illegality in the 
bud rather than waiting for it to mature before striking it down.

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 21: The Supreme Court started hearing of a 
constitutional petition challenging the validity of the 13th 
Amendment declined to suspend the operation of the Amendment, and 
adjourned it to Nov. 27.
    
The court issued a notice to the federation of Pakistan, and the 
Attorney to appear on Nov. 27 to explain their position.
    
Syed Iqbal Haider, contended that due to removal of the president's 
discretionary powers to dissolve the assembly, he was not powerful 
enough to play an effective role in resolving the constitutional 
crisis in the country. The PML and its allied parties demolished 
the constitutional structure in the name of massive mandate, he 
stated.
    
Shehzad Jehangir, former attorney-general appeared on behalf of the 
petitioner said by depriving the president of his powers to 
dissolve the National Assembly under Article 58(2)(b), the present 
legislature exposed the country to threat of martial law.

<a name="bena">Benazir vows to resist retrenchments</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim ur Rehman

KARACHI, Nov. 15: The Chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party, 
Ms Benazir Bhutto, accused Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of pursuing 
policies that would threaten the federation.
    
Demanding immediate reinstatement of those who had been sacked from 
banks and other public sector organizations, she accused Mian Nawaz 
Sharif of entering into an agreement to deprive over 300,000 people 
of livelihood.
    
She said influential loan defaulters, not workers, were responsible 
for banks' stringency. Ms Bhutto said she had presented a list of 
500 bank defaulters in the National Assembly. "Instead of 
recovering the money from them, Mian Nawaz Sharif had resorted to 
anti-people policy of retrenchment and forced retirements under the 
pretext of downsizing and imposing tax on small agriculturists." 
She alleged that the prime minister was among leading bank 
defaulters.
 
She also accused him of entering into a secret agreement to slash 
the strength of the armed forces. She demanded that IMF and the WB 
should "ask Nawaz Sharif to return public money" and withdraw taxes 
on small agriculturists. Ms Bhutto said during her two stints in 
the government she had provided jobs to many, but the government of 
Mian Nawaz Sharif had thrown them out. She alleged that Mian Nawaz 
Sharif was an "associate of those who killed workers of Colony Mill 
at Multan, removed employees of Wah Ordnance Factories and imposed 
a ban on trade union activities." Castigating the government, Ms 
Bhutto also dwelt on the price spiral and the law and order 
situation.
    
The PPP chairperson said that unless the poor people of Pakistan 
felt secure and were assured of their livelihood, Pakistan would 
not make progress.

KARACHI, Nov. 20: The Ehtesab Bench of the High Court of Sindh, 
sentenced Pir Mazharul Haq, a former provincial minister for 
housing and planning; ex-member of KDA Shah Mansoor Alam, and a 
beneficiary, Abdul Razzak, in a land conversion case,  to five 
years RI and a fine of Rs 2 million each or in default of payment

the occupant of an amenity plot, measuring 2,666.66 square yards, 
in Sector No ST-3, Sector 12/C, North Karachi township, and had 
applied to KDA on Aug 18,1993, for its regularisation. The 
director(Recoveries), KDA, in his note had opposed the

<a name="kans">Kansi's signature on confession statement differs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai 

FAIRFAX, Virginia, Nov. 18: The local court which tried and 
sentenced Mir Aimal Kansi to death released the evidence in his 
case for the media and a cursory look establishes that the 
confession signed by Kansi was written by the FBI agents.
    
The evidence, besides the confessional statement, included the AK-
47 gun, pistols and ammunition used in the CIA killings, pictures 
of the crime scene, reports of the specialists and scanning tests 
done on Kansi and copies of applications made by Kansi to buy 
firearms and seek asylum in the US.
    
Interestingly, the documents reveal that Kansi's signatures on the 
confessional statement were totally different from what he normally 
signed on the asylum application or the forms he filled to buy the 
gun and two pistols.
    
The statement, signed by Kansi on board the aircraft while on way 
from Pakistan to the US, was written by an FBI agent, in capital 
letters on two small lined papers. It was written in pure legal 
language and said:  "I, Aimal Khan Kasi, also known as Mir Aimal 
Kansi, freely and voluntarily provide this statement to SA Bradley 
J. Garrett and SA Sean Joyce of the FBI. No threats or promises 
have been made to me. I can read, write and have a master's degree 
in English.
    
"Approximately two-three days prior to the shooting outside CIA 
headquarters in January 1993, I purchased a AK-47 rifle and approx 
150 rounds of AK-47 ammo. I also purchased two pistols at this 
time. On Monday 1-25-93 I drove my Isuzu pick-up truck to the 
entrance road off of HW123 in Fairfax Co VA. I had with me the 
purchased AK-47 and several magazines of ammo. I parked my truck in 
the right lane of 2 left lanes that turn into CIA headquarters. I 
got out of my vehicle I started shooting into vehicles stopped at a 
red light. I shot approximately 10 rounds shooting 5 people. I 
aimed for the chest area of the people shot. I then returned to my 
truck & drove back to my apartment in Herndon, VA after stopping at 
a park approx. 1 mile from the shooting. The next day I returned to 
Pakistan.
    
This statement is accurate and correct. Also several days before 
the shooting I decided to do the shooting at the CIA or the Israeli 
Embassy but decided to shoot at the CIA because it was easier 
because CIA officers are not armed."
    
X signed Aimal Kasi, 6-17-97

Witness: SA signed Bradley Garrett, FBI, 6-17-97
     
SA S. M. Joyce, FBI, 6/17/97
    
The signatures of Kansi on this statement read Aimal Kasi while in 
all other papers which he signed on his own free will, he has 
written Mir Aimal.
    
The confession was admitted as evidence in the case, despite 
objections by the defence but later when the defence could have 
pointed out the discrepancies, they never mounted any defence for 
Kansi and concentrated only on the post-guilty phase to try to save 
him from death penalty, which they ultimately could not.

<a name="newp">New policy to attract $5bn foreign investment</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 21: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced a 
comprehensive new investment policy which is expected to attract 
five billion dollar foreign investment during the next three years.
    
One of the major features of the new investment policy is that the 
customs duty has totally been abolished on the import of plant, 
machinery and equipment not manufactured locally. The prime 
minister also promised to accept some of the suggestions given by 
the businessmen and said that the new policy will be made effective 
in one week time after having incorporated these proposals.
    
SALIENT FEATURES: The premier said," the essence of the policy is 
to keep Pakistan attractive in international investment market by 
improving the policy regime, offering fiscal and tariff relief and 
through providing procedural and social facilitation". Special 
attention has been given to the development of human capital and 
the base for quality services. It is pertinent to mention that the 
measures have been proposed in comparison with other Asian 
countries and considering macro-economic scenario of the country.
    
The policy comprises three sections, i.e. a) Policies, b) 
Incentives, and c) Facilitation.
    
The foreign direct investment in Pakistan until now has been 
limited to the manufacturing sector under which the following 
policy incentives were available:
    
- Foreign exchange controls had been relaxed.
    
- Foreign investors had been allowed participation in local 
projects on 100% equity basis.
    
- There was no compulsion for a limited company to offer shares to 
the public even if its paid-up capital exceeded Rs100 million.
    
- Full safeguards had been provided to protect foreign investment.
    
- There was no requirement of having local partners and full 
repatriation of capital, capital gains and dividend was allowed.
    
- Ceilings on payment of royalties and technical fee had been 
abolished.
    
- Work permit restrictions on expatriate managers and technical 
personnel working in an industrial undertaking had been withdrawn 
and remittance restrictions had been eased.
    
- No government sanction was required for setting up an industry in 
any field, place and size, except for the following four 
industries:-
    
Arms and ammunitions;
    
- High explosive;
    
- Radioactive substances;
    
- Security printing, currency and mint.
    
- There was no requirement for obtaining No Objection Certificate 
(NOC) from the provincial government for locating the project 
anywhere in the country except the areas which were notified as 
negative.
    
- In the new investment policy the manufacturing sector has been 
prioritized in four categories;
    
A. Value-added or export industry: All those units which can attain 
a minimum of 40% value-addition will be taken as value-added units 
and all those industries which can export 80% of their production 
will be treated as export industry.
    
B. Hi-tech;
    
C. Priority industry; and
    
D. Agro-based industry.
    
These categories will be liable to change as a result of the review 
of Cabinet Committee on Investment (CCOI) as and when deemed 
necessary.
    
The industries falling under categories A&B, e.g. leather, textile, 
footwear, surgical, sports goods, carpets, electronic, sea food 
industry, mining, powder metallurgical industry and manufacture of 
alloys and stainless steel, information technology, solar 
technology, aerospace and defence production etc. will get First 
Year Allowance (FYA) on capital expenditure/investment @ 90% and 
Re-investment Allowance (RA) @ 50% of capital/investment will also 
be admissible in balancing, modernization, replacing and expansion. 
The net effect of these allowances will be that profits will not be 
taxable until the capital expenditure has been recovered.
    
The industries falling under categories C&D, which cover main areas 
of engineering/capital goods, petro-chemicals, chemicals, 
production of quality/hybrid seeds, edible oil extraction/refinery, 
live stock/poultry feed, milk processing, agri-based value-added 
productions etc. will be entitled to First Year Allowance (FYA) @ 
75%. Similarly, these industries will also be entitled to re-
investment allowance @ 50%.In case of all other industries, which 
do not fall under the four categories, accelerated depreciation 
allowance at an enhanced rate of 50% will be allowed.

pleasure to announce that the import tariff on plant and machinery 
(not manufactured locally) used for agriculture will be zero 
rated", the premier said. List of specific machinery and equipment 
will, however, be notified later. Other incentives granted under

industrial estates, free industrial zones, free trade zone and 
export oriented units within the areas of its boundary, will be 
launched at a few selected prime sites. Export-oriented units will 
however be allowed to be set up all over the country.
    
The unit will undertake production and operation in bonded factory 
under customs control. The scheme focuses on efficient 
industrialization and development with export-led strategy in a 
contiguous, congenial investor-friendly-environment. It will 
promote local and foreign investment through invigorating the 
participation of private sector in development of the zones and 
provision of incentives, facilities and one window service by the 
government to support the investors in establishment and operation 
of their projects.
    
Infrastructure within the zone will be developed by the private 
sector investors. Development, management and marketing of 
industrial estates/free industrial zones and free trade zones will 
be offered to local and foreign investors. Provision of 
infrastructure and utility facilities up to the zone will be the 
responsibility either of relevant agencies of the government or the 
developer/investor.
    
The premier said, the industry specific tariff and fiscal 
incentives and other concessions as provided in the new investment 
policy will be available to the projects to be located in these 
zones.

<a name="loan">Loan linked to approval of SEC by Parliament</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov. 19: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) would offer 
500 million dollars for modernizing capital market, and improving 
social sectors in the country.
    
"The ADB plans to extend 250 million dollars loan for introducing 
market reform program on the pattern of ESAF of the IMF", disclosed 
Mr. Geert Van Der Linden, the local chief of the ADB.
    
Talking to Dawn on Wednesday, he however, pointed out that the 
first tranche of the market development fund would not be offered 
unless the government got an approval from the Parliament for the 
setting of the Security and Exchange Commission. He said another 
250 million dollars will be made available to Pakistan for 
undertaking development projects. "Both the programs will be 
started in 1998 about which a broad understanding has been reached 
between the ADB and the Government of Pakistan".
    
Giving the details, Mr. Linden said that the market development 
loan would stimulate the stock market and help modernize the 
system. Discussing 250 million dollar project loan, he said that 
social sectors specially women education, non-formal education, 
rural development and a pilot irrigation scheme in Punjab will be 
supported.
    
In addition, Mr. Linden said, the ADB was considering to offer 250 
million dollars for trade and export promotion of Pakistan. The 
package, he pointed out, also included training of the people.
    
Responding to a question, the ADB chief said that there were large 
number of conditionalities attached to loan packages. He said that 
further reduction of tariffs was also one of the conditions. It was 
also one of the conditionalities, he pointed out, that Mutual Fund 
Schemes should be operated in the capital market like that of the 
insurance companies.
    
Asked about the problems, Mr. Linden said that since Pakistan was 
facing financial difficulties, it has not been able to arrange 
counterpart funding in the execution of development projects. He 
said that the ADB wanted certain provisions in the Public Sector 
Development Program (PSDP) to protect development program and 
projects.
    
He said that ADB was providing 300 million dollars separately for 
Ghazi Brotha which will cost 2 billion dollars. He said that beside 
ADB, the World Bank would provide 350 million dollars, 350 million 
dollars by the OECF of Japan, 150 million dollars by KFD of Germany 
and 70 million dollars by the Islamic  Development Bank for Ghazi 
Brotha. He was of the view that Pakistan should arrange counterpart 
funding for this project as well as for other 52 projects so that 
they could be completed in time.

<a name="powe">Power consumers forced to pay more</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sultan Ahmed

WITH a crushing current deficit of Rs 30 billion, a ban from the 
prime minister on raising the power tariff despite the rising cost 
of power production and distribution and the heavy debts it has to 
repay or service, WAPDA, the proverbial white elephant of Pakistan 
is in an agonizing quandary.
    
However, instead of raising the tariff, as it has always tended to 
do in such circumstances, WAPDA and the Karachi Electric Supply 
Corporation (KESC) are coming up with devious new means to make the 
hard-pressed consumers pay more.
    
If the KESC earlier increased the security deposit substantially 
and then the fee for new connection steeply, WAPDA is to come up 
with enhanced monthly meter charges and earn Rs 3,000 million 
through the latest measure.
    
When members of the National Assembly protested against such 
increases in charges after the prime minister's categorical 
assurance in the Assembly that power rates would not be raised, 
minister for water and power Raja Nadir Pervez said the government 
had no other option when consumers did not pay their bills, and 
WAPDA could not recover the outstanding amounts even after 
disconnection.
    
He also told the NA that WAPDA sustained a loss of Rs 3.94 billion 
as a result of 6,73,000 consumers not paying their bills. As a 
result of the WAPDA's large deficit it has not been able to repay 
the large temporary loans taken from the government and the gas 
bills of Pakistan Petroleum Ltd., Sui Northern and Sui Southern Gas 
and the PSO's huge oil bills, and the amount it owes to 
multinational companies like Siemens for the equipment it got from 
it.

provide cellular telephone facilities by June 2000. He said that 
the PTCL will be provided advanced technologies to compete with 
other cellular companies operating in Pakistan. Asked about the 
tariffs, he assured that they would be quite competitive and would 
be acceptable to the users because of being comparatively cheap.

achieve sustained growth and expand the engineering sector. High-
tech industries like software industry and manufacture of solar 
energy equipment and electronic industry will be given priority and 
special encouragement.
    
The new industrial policy aims at achieving a growth rate of 7.2 
per cent in the manufacturing sector during the current financial 
year which will be gradually increased to double digit. The growth 
in the large-scale manufacturing is projected to grow at the rate 
of 6.5 per cent during the current year and thereafter to around 7 
per cent. The growth in the small scale manufacturing is projected 
at 8.4 per cent keeping in view the past performance of this sector 
during the last many years.

At the end of June these representatives, en masse, decided that 
they would amend the Constitution in the hope that the amendment 
would keep them in office for as long as it takes. In the process, 
they agreed to voluntarily restrict their freedom of expression and 
their freedom of dissent (and consequently ours). The motive of the 
amendment: the further and more foolproof use of public office for 
personal gain and good.
    
On June 30, in the Senate the rules of procedure were suspended, 
i.e. that a Bill, when introduced, is referred to the relevant 
standing committee which is given thirty days within which to 
submit its report, with changes and recommendations, if any, to 
each legislator within seven days of its finalization. Thereafter, 
two clear days must elapse before it can be sent down for a motion. 
The Bill went through like a shot, passed in less than a day, 
without one single protest or dissent being recorded.
    
On July 1, the Bill was presented to the National Assembly. Again 
rules of procedure were suspended, and the Bill was passed 
immediately, again without one single protest or dissent. It went 
up to the President, on July 3 he put his signature to the Bill, 
and the Fourteenth Amendment Act of 1997 came into force.
    
Its purpose is to prevent defections from political parties, aka 
lotaism. But, a member of a parliamentary party will not only be 
deemed to have defected if he in actual fact defects, but also if 
he breaches any declared or undeclared party discipline, code of 
conduct or policies, or if he votes contrary to any direction 
issued by his parliamentary party, or if he abstains from voting, 
as instructed by his party, on any Bill. The prosecutor, defence 
counsel, judge and jury who will decide the member's fate is the 
head of the party, whose decision is not justiciable in any court 
of law.
    
Ironically, on July 4, American Independence Day, our freely and 
fairly elected representatives stood accused of having voluntarily 
forfeited their right to represent their constituents and stood 
stripped of their mandate.
    
On October 29, hearing two constitutional petitions, filed by two 
citizens of Pakistan, challenging the 14th Amendment. Chief Justice 
of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah and his brother judges Mukhtar Ahmed 
Junejo and Mohammed Bashir Jehangiri were pleased to pass an 
interim order and suspend the operation of the Amendment. No action 
shall be allowed to be taken against any member, under this 
Amendment, until the petitions are finally disposed of.
    
If our parliamentarians do not wish to be ostracized, they should 
pass an act repealing the Fourteenth Amendment without any further 
procrastination, thereby rendering the petitions in the Supreme 
Court infructuous. By doing so they may yet be able to redeem the 
honour and respectability they are still left with.

<a name="back">Back to the brink</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Irfan Husain

JUST when you think we can't sink any deeper into the mire, you can 
count on our leaders to plunge another fathom or two. To date, they 
haven't been able to touch bottom, although it hasn't been for lack 
of trying.
    
Events these last few weeks have been moving at a speed resembling 
a Greek tragedy seen on fast forward. Every day, we are given fresh 
intimations of this government's mortality, and every day, we 
discover yet again our leaders' limited mental powers. The entire 
country is aghast that such trivial issues could be blown into a 
full-fledged constitutional crisis of proportions we cannot yet 
assess.
    
The prime minister himself is on record as saying that the country 
is losing billions every day as a result of the unending 
uncertainty we face. One of his ministers puts the figure as high 
as ten billion. Apart from the financial impact of the clash of the 
titans, Nawaz Sharif's moral authority to rule has been seriously 
eroded. In addition, the country has (yet again) become a 
laughingstock in the comity of nations. It is hard to get somebody 
like the American secretary of state to take you seriously when you 
don't know if you are going to be thrown out of office tomorrow.
    
As the implications of the confrontation became clearer, there was 
much shifting of blame away from the prime minister to his 
advisers. Calculated, off-the-record suggestions started appearing 
in the papers to the effect that heads would roll among the PM's 
legal team. But those projecting this line did not dwell on the 
fact that it was Nawaz Sharif who appointed his advisers and 
ministers in the first place, and then accepted their advice.
    
I may be wrong, but I think it was Theodore Roosevelt who put a 
small sign on his desk at the White House saying: "The Buck Stops 
Here." In Pakistan, a more appropriate slogan for our chief 
executive would be: "The Buck Stops Here, There and Everywhere." 
Nobody is willing to accept responsibility for his mistakes. It is 
always somebody else's fault. Often it is an international 
conspiracy, and every now and then, there is a "hidden hand." 
Whenever one of our leaders blunders — not a rare occurrence — he 
or she immediately points a finger at somebody else.
    
In a recent interview, Nawaz Sharif told a reporter that "they" 
were out to get him, just as they had in 1993. Unfortunately, the 
reporter didn't ask the obvious question: Why did the PM start a 
totally unnecessary confrontation in the first place? Three years 
ago, he took on the president and the COAS; this time around he has 
taken on the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Both crises were 
suicidal and self-created.
    
Similarly, Benazir Bhutto blames the media for her downfall. She 
does not stop to think that it was she and her husband who gave the 
press so much to speculate and comment on. Had she run an honest 
and competent government, she would still have been prime minister. 
Two decades ago, her late father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, blamed the 
Americans for toppling him. Till the very end, he did not see that 
the charge of election rigging had supplied his opponents the 
impetus to destabilize his government.
    
Pakistani politics is replete with examples of this unbending 
attitude. Our inability to admit a mistake and apologize is a 
national characteristic. Whether we are behind the steering wheel 
or behind an office desk, we are congenitally incapable of publicly 
acknowledging our fault. Thus, we have convinced ourselves that 
somebody else is to blame. We do not learn from our mistakes and go 
on repeating them. This has happened twice with Benazir Bhutto, and 
Nawaz Sharif is in real danger of following in her less than 
illustrious footsteps.
    
This preoccupation with saving face — or keeping the mustache 
unbowed and the nose intact — has hamstrung our efforts to develop 
and evolve as a society. Whether a tribal chief, a feudal lord, an 
industrialist, a bureaucrat or a politician, all Pakistanis suffer 
from this fatal macho outlook. The result is a constant search for 
scapegoats, and a steadfast refusal to accept responsibility for 
any wrongdoing. This attitude ensures that there will be no 
improvement in any field as everybody manages to convince himself 
that he was absolutely right and somebody else committed the 
mistake.
    
Another attitude that has led us to our present sorry state is the 
difficulty our leaders have in comprehending the alien concepts of 
power-sharing and checks and balances. These are at the heart of 
any working democracy, but are beyond the grasp of our politicians. 
In backward societies like ours which make a show of following 
democratic traditions, this is a real problem. The model of 
leadership Pakistani politicians have before them is the Moghul 
dynasty with its code of unquestioned authority. Even 
superficially, well-educated people like Benazir Bhutto cannot bear 
to share power to the extent that for nearly three years she 
refused to appoint a finance minister, preferring to hold this 
crucial portfolio herself. Although politicians have reluctantly 
learned to acknowledge the army's clout — acquired largely because 
of their own incompetence — they are loath to share power with the 
other pillars of democracy. Thus, when the Chief Justice asserted 
himself, Nawaz Sharif saw this as a threat to his power, not as 
something normal in democracy. There are many instances of the US 
Congress shooting down a nominee of the president without causing a 
constitutional crisis. Here, just because the prime minister (or 
his father) felt unhappy about a couple of judges recommended by 
the Chief Justice, we are once again on the brink of the precipice.
    
As I write this, it is crystal clear that Nawaz Sharif has driven 
himself into a corner. By resigning with good grace, he can still 
save the system. He has antagonized too many powerful forces to be 
able to rule with any moral authority. Without any rhyme or reason, 
he has provoked the Chief Justice and the president, and we can be 
sure that he won no friends at GHQ by his tantrums that have caused 
havoc with the national economy and polity.

<a name="amat">A matter of commitment</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By M.B. Naqvi

THESE are not the best of times for this crisis-ridden country. The 
economy is in a bad shape and law and order is rapidly 
deteriorating, chiefly in Karachi, most parts of Punjab and some 
other areas in Balochistan. The dominant political trends — 
sectarianism, tribalisms of all kinds and ethnic chanvinisms — only 
sadden democrats.
    
Signs of bad governance are everywhere. We are supposed to be a 
parliamentary democracy. The news and analyses about parliamentary 
politics reeking of intrigue and unprincipled factionalism make 
dismal reading. National leadership seems to lack both commitment 
and steady nerves, its vital ingredients.
    
It is easy to diagnose the ills. We Pakistanis are in point of 
simple fact failing to rise to the challenges facing us. Most 
decision-making on larger issues of national importance is 
frequently dictated by personal motives. If we go by some of the 
press reports emanating from Islamabad — a rare blend of rumour, 
speculation and special pleading by obscure groups — major 
differences originate in petty squables among high officers of the 
state. Only one positive thing can be said: virtually all dirty 
linen is now being washed in public and few sordid goings- on 
remain secret. Which is one of the desirable byproducts of even a 
partial and defective democracy.
    
Some of the filth and pettiness in politics is due to two factors. 
The first and more important one is the political under- 
development of our people that has enabled narrow elite groups to 
corner power and they have no commitment to higher ideals by virtue 
of their social origins, though a few of them do have elementary 
personal decencies. But such persons are few and far between. The 
best of them are committed to promoting their political and social 
ambitions, with this rest being busy augmenting personal fortunes.
    
The second factor is both insidious and pervasive: corruption. 
Corruption is deep-rooted and pervasive. Maximum energies of the 
government are being devoted ostensibly to fighting corruption, 
what with the Accountability Cell in the PM's secretariat and all 
the worldwide chase of tainted money. But anyone can see that Mr. 
Nawaz Sharif is simply carrying on an old tradition: harass and 
oppress your opponent. Ms Benazir Bhutto did it to him and he is 
now returning the compliment with a vengeance. Other can illustrate 
the absence of good governance better. 
   
There is no doubt that corruption is at the bottom of many of the 
ills that the nation is suffering from. Even the World Bank has now 
started emphasizing corruption as a cause for both under-
development and many of the specific ills of Pakistan's economy. 
But it is necessary that we keep the perspective level.
    
Corruption is not anything new or recent. It is a part of the 
subcontinent's culture. Folklore in almost all parts of South Asia 
speaks of corruption and its open and devious ways. Indeed, it 
colours all or most motivations, attitudes and expectations. A 
bribe is not simply taken; it has to be given too. 
   
The willingness of the giver is as vital as the desire of the 
taker. In our day-to-day living anyone can observe the operation of 
this factor in things petty at the grassroots and in larger matters 
at higher levels as well. Until our culture and civilization 
produce persons of sturdy character who would do their duty without 
fear or favour, we cannot expect to eliminate corruption. It is 
going to be a long haul even when society desires to reform itself 
resolutely in all spheres.
    
Yet for this nation — the very description seems to beg the 
question because many among our intelligentsia wince at it — 
corruption cannot be left alone in the name of its civilizational 
character. Unless incidence of corruption in the higher echelons of 
government is contained, Pakistan is likely to lurch from one 
serious crisis to the next. Few can forget that all the four 
dismissals of governments during the last ten years were based on 
the perception, among the practorian guards or the establishment, 
of their being guilty of corruption and maladministration. Similar 
causes can produce similar results, and enactment's alone cannot 
change basic power correlation's.
    
The instincts, assumptions and attitudes of today's rulers are 
absolutely indistinguishable from those of the previous lot of 
rulers. Why? because they are chips of the same block having the 
same social origins, characterized by an absence of idealism and 
given to self-seeking in the name of pragmatism. There is every 
indication that the constitutional crisis that had arisen as a 
result of the rifts between the PM and the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan has not finally removed all signs of trouble at the top. 
Little of impotence can be said about the current Islamabad 
situation because much of the news comprises speculation and 
rumours. That there may be something cooking in the overheated 
atmosphere of Islamabad may be likely. But how to unravel the 
inscrutability's of the haze?
    
It is in this situation that the leadership and the functioning of 
the PM comes into sharp focus. He has to display both a steady 
nerve — as distinct from stubbornness and pugnacity — and a 
commitment to democratize ideals and not merely references to his 
popular mandate. Democracy and all its institutions have to be 
allowed to function in their true spirit. The PM will do well to 
recognize that the state of the nation requires both change and 
deft handling. Bending of rules and gimmicks will only intensify 
crisis and uncertainty. If democratic government and institutions 
have to survive, they must plan and carry out change through 
innovation and cool foresight.
    
Change of methodology has to be adopted in any case in order to 
prevail and to achieve anything — indeed, to implement change. The 
PM must constantly be receiving reports of conspiracies by this or 
that group or even institution. That is where his nerve is going to 
be tested: let him take the risks and do the right thing. That is 
the only way to operate for a democratic leader and to survive. 
Supposing he does not servive in office — a possibility he cannot 
ignore — he must take that also in the stride. Going into the 
wilderness for doing the right thing will ensure a brighter 
political future.
    
One has mentioned two things: commitment to democratic objectives 
and institutions; and democratic methodology in decision-making. 
The latter has many implications. His having been elected by a 
large majority does not necessarily entitle him to take major 
decisions in a kitchen cabinet. All such decisions must be taken in 
the proper cabinet and in a democratic spirit. 
   
That is the way for a decision to acquire political and moral 
weight and strength. Also such decisions are likely to be fully 
implemented. Only then can powerful vested interests be kept at 
bay. That is the way a genuine democratic leader can survive and 
prevail: when obstructed, all he has to do is to take the matter to 
the people directly and involve them in the making of tough 
decision. That is how true democracy functions; that is how it 
strikes root and strengthens itself. The leader who involves the 
people with his own decision-making has nothing to fear from vested 
interests or elite groups. Let Mian Nawaz Sharif operate as a 
democratic leader.  He will find he has nothing to fear from power 
brokers or other strategically-placed individuals or institutions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

NO ONE with any concern for the country's fortunes or its future 
will remain undismayed at the present turn of events. It is no 
exaggeration to say that unless wisdom prevails, where we are 
headed is towards disaster. Yet the truly tragic aspect of this 
situation is that those who are in a position to influence events 
and take decisions seem to have put blinkers on their eyes. 
Heedless of the consequences, they are playing blind man's buff 
when what the nation seeks is a firm hand on the tiller and some 
thought and compassion for its problems. It takes no extraordinary 
perspicacity to see that the problem which has the whole nation in 
its thrall is not simply a matter of legal technicalities hinging 
upon a particular law. It has now developed to a point where if 
left unresolved by the nation's collective wisdom it will endanger 
the entire edifice of democracy. This is what is at stake and yet 
this realization seems not to be dawning upon the wise heads of the 
ruling party. Indeed, if these same heads had shown a greater 
measure of prudence and ordinary common sense than they have 
hitherto demonstrated, it is arguable that things would not have 
come to their present pass.
    
The ruling party, relying more on its numbers than on a clear 
reading of the situation, is trying to meet the predicament into 
which it has been put by the contempt petition against the prime 
minister and others by instant and thoughtless legislation. If laws 
alone could save governments Pakistani democracy could never have 
been swept off its rails as so often it has been in the past. Yet 
this government seems not to be imbibing such simple home truths 
which after all come not from the pages of Confucius or any other 
philosopher but our own dark and troubled experience.
    
To say that somebody (let us not specify who) is being obstinate 
begs more questions than it answers. What has brought the nation 
and the government to the present situation? Statesmanship lies not 
in reacting to events but in so conducting oneself as to forestall 
difficult eventualities. The prime minister and his impressive 
phalanx of advisers could not read where their stand-off with the 
judiciary was taking them and the country. Even now that they are 
in the thick of the storm they are not realizing the gravity of the 
situation. They are thinking it is simply a legal battle, which is 
why they are relying on the so-called legal wizards to bail them 
out of it. What is needed instead is political vision (a badly 
abused term though this is in our political milieu) but of this 
quality there is precious little evidence on the capital's 
Constitution Avenue.
    
This is a crisis which must be resolved not by legal nit-picking 
but by the coming together of the President, the Chief Justice, the 
Prime Minister and, reluctant though we are to say this, the Chief 
of the Army Staff. The Constitution of course has no provision for 
such a gathering. But then the Constitution has no provision 
permitting or condoning the repeated follies of Pakistan's 
governing classes. If the country's political leadership cannot put 
their house in order, they have no one to blame but themselves if 
other forces step in to fill the vacuum created by their ineptitude 
and their blundering ways. Even otherwise it has not been lost upon 
the people that in this crisis too repeated calls have been made 
upon the assistance of the army chief.
    
This is a tragic situation and simply shows up the inadequacy of 
our leaders. But since it is also a real situation, there is no 
alternative except to make the best of it. Let all the figures we 
have named come together and try to resolve what is not an 
insuperable problem. The people of Pakistan deserve a reprieve from 
crises inflicted upon them by their rulers. They deserve a reprieve 
from the politics of foolishness and shortsightedness. There is 
still time to avert the worst but only if all concerned rise above 
the pettiness of their minds, perceptions and spirit and see where 
the country is headed.

<a name="wisn">WI snatch back initiative from Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

PESHAWAR, Nov. 18: Pakistan squandered a golden opportunity to 
build a sizable lead over the West Indies when they finished the 
second day of the first cricket Test at 246 for five at the Arbab 
Niaz Stadium.
    
Last evening's overnight pair of Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad had set 
a perfect stage for a huge first innings total when they shared in 
an enterprising 133-run second wicket partnership. But the 
departure of the two batsmen in a space of 14 balls, exposed 
Pakistan's brittle and suspected batting.
    
Mohammad Wasim was unfortunate to drag in Courtney Walsh's 
delivery, which kept low, on to his stumps while skipper Wasim 
Akram was stumped by David Williams off Carl Hooper when he was 
half way down the wicket.
    
What is more upsetting and mind-boggling is the fact that Akram 
once again came ahead of Azhar Mahmood. Akram had done the same in 
the quadrangular tournament that cost Pakistan the match against 
South Africa.
    
The home team could have been in further disarray had Courtney 
Walsh held on to simplest of chances offered by Inzamamul Haq at 
mid-on. But the West Indies skipper showed greasy palms and 
Pakistan escaped from being four down for 159. Nevertheless, Walsh 
partly settled his account with Inzamam when his yorker struck 
Inzamam's centre finger of the right foot which forced the batsman 
to retire. But this catch will certainly haunt Walsh in his dreams 
because it would have brought the West Indies right back into the 
Test.
    
Moin, struck six boundaries and a massive six to Test debutante 
Rawl Lewis to be batting on 36. Azhar was on 14 with the two having 
added 39 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket partnership.
    
The feature of the day was, however, innings of contrasting styles 
by Saeed Anwar and Ijaz Ahmad. While Saeed batted with a mixture of 
defence and controlled aggression, Ijaz was more over ambitious 
when he threw his bat against everything. But the hallmark of both 
the innings was that the two key batsmen found their lost forms.
    
Saeed Anwar desperately needed runs to retain his place in the side 
and he obliged his fans with a delight 65 helped with nine 
exquisite boundaries. Anwar, who recorded his 14th half century in 
25 tests, was under severe pressure when he could score only 40 
runs in five innings against South Africa. The way Anwar batted 
proved that the batsman has worked really hard on his batting as 
well as concentration.
    
Ijaz scored 65 with 10 blistering boundaries from 134 balls after a 
little over three hours of occupancy of the wicket. It was his 10th 
half century in 40 Tests.
    
The West Indies bowling remained erratic while the fielding sloppy 
as the fielders gifted the batsmen with some cheap runs. Courtney 
Walsh added the wicket of Mohammad Wasim to his yesterday's scalp 
of Aamir Sohail to finish with two for 30. Hooper accounted for 
Saeed Anwar behind the wickets and then had Wasim Akram to end with 
two for 37.

<a name="well">Pakistan well placed after Inzamam's heroics</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

PESHAWAR, Nov. 19: Inzamamul Haq was denied of a personal landmark 
but his heroics were enough to put Pakistan in a winning position 
against the West Indies in the first cricket Test being played here 
at the Arbab Niaz Stadium.
    
Inzamam scored a brave and courageous unbeaten 92 to propel 
Pakistan to 381 that provided the home team a first innings lead of 
230.
    
In the post-tea session, Wasim Akram and Mushtaq Ahmed picked up 
the wickets of Stuart Williams (3) and Shivnarine Chanderpaul (14) 
respectively to reduce the West Indies to 99 for two at stumps on 
the third day, still 131 runs in arrears. But the only concern in 
the Pakistan camp would be the form shown by Brian Lara in his 40-
minute innings in which he hammered nine punishing boundaries, 
including two each in Arshad Khan and Mushtaq Ahmed's one over.
    
With Lara was Sherwin Campbell batting on 34 that included five 
hits to the fence. But the star of the day was, however, Inzamamul 
Haq who was robbed of his first century at home as he ran out of 
partners. Shahid Nazir (18) and Mushtaq Ahmed (4) gave excellent 
support to Inzamam but their efforts could not help Inzamam to 
break the jinx.
    
It has been the third time that Inzamam has reached 90s — second 
time on this centre in two years — in home Tests but failed to 
complete centuries. Inzamam batted with authority and confidence 
but the key element of luck also favored him. He was dropped four 
times when on 5, 32, 35 and 88 besides escaping with a very close 
run-out call. Nevertheless, as people say `fortunes favor the 
brave', same happened to the star batsman.
    
Inzamam was handicapped when he had to bat with a runner after 
receiving telling blows on his left foot. On the first day, a David 
Williams struck him on his ankle and on Tuesday, a Courtney Walsh 
yorker crushed his middle finger of the same foot. But he defied 
all pains to play an innings which may well help Pakistan notch up 
his first Test win over the West Indies in seven years. Pakistan 
last beat the Caribbeans in the 1990-91 home series at Karachi by 
eight wickets.
    
Inzamam was a class by himself. He struck the ball with ferocious 
power and the nine boundaries that came of his willow hardly 
allowed the fielders any chance. The two sixes he struck off Rawl 
Lewis were simply blistering as one of them landed in the Pakistan 
team dressing room.
    
Overall, Inzamam occupied the crease for four hours and 33 minutes 
during which he received 191 balls. But while Inzamam was dropped 
four times, Mohammad Wasim did all his leg work as he did the duty 
of the 27-year-old batsman's runner. On Tuesday, Aamir Sohail had 
done the similar work before Inzamam had to retire when 13.
    
Inzamam also benefited from the legs of Wasim on 88 when he 
narrowly survived a run-out. Had Inzamam being running himself, he 
would have surely been run-out by half the pitch as he is one of 
the slowest movers in cricket today and perhaps the worst runners 
between the wickets.
    
Inzamam's cause was also eased out by erratic and ill-planned West 
Indies bowlers. Inzamam was having problems in coming on to the 
front foot and instead of pitching the ball up, they bowled short 
of length which Inzamam played comfortably on the back foot with 
all the weight of his body coming on his strong right leg.
    
Inzamam, was quick to get down to business when overnight batsman 
Azhar Mahmood departed in the second over of the day with Pakistan 
only adding four runs to his overnight score of 246 for five. 
Together with Moin Khan, Inzamam added 44 runs for the seventh 
wicket. The stand was broken when Moin mistimed a hook and was 
taken safely this time by Courtney Walsh at mid-on off Ian Bishop.
    
Moin, who had resumed this morning at 36, registered his seventh 
Test half century in 30 games by hitting a valuable 58 which was 
Pakistan innings fourth half century.
    
The Pakistan wicketkeeper, who played the four-nation cup at Lahore 
as a batsman, struck seven elegant boundaries and two sixes in his 
124-ball innings which lasted for about three hours. But it were 
the stands with Shahid Nazir and Mushtaq Ahmed that helped Pakistan 
reach 381 and Inzamam 92.
    
For the ninth wicket, Inzamam and Nazir put on 43 runs in 77 
minutes. And when Mushtaq joined his pal, Inzamam was 62 but 
managed to add another 30 in a partnership of 34 in 42 minutes. For 
the West Indies, Courtney Walsh, who ended Mushtaq's resilience 
with a perfectly executed yorker, finished with five wickets for 78 
runs in 32 overs.
    
It was the 14th time that the 35-year-old Jamaican had taken five 
or more wickets in an innings in 94 Tests. An injury-prone Ian 
Bishop finished with three for 76 and the other two wickets went to 
Carl Hooper.

<a name="whip">Pakistan whip West Indies by an innings and 19 runs</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

PESHAWAR, Nov. 20: Pakistan's champion spinner Mushtaq Ahmed 
recorded his fourth 10-wicket haul in a match as Pakistan whipped 
the West Indies by an innings and 19 runs in the opening Test of 
the three-match series at the Arbab Niaz Stadium.
    
Mushtaq, named Man-of-the-Match, followed up his five for 35 in the 
first innings with five for 71 in the second as the visitors were 
sent crashing out for 211 while needing 230 to make the home team 
bat again. That gave the little Mushy his career-best match figures 
of 10 for 106 eclipsing the previous best of 10 for 143 against New 
Zealand at Lahore last year.
    
The West Indies, who lost with more than one-and-a-half day to 
spare, had resumed this morning at 99 for two.
    
The match was also a personal achievement for skipper Wasim Akram. 
The star allrounder made his critics bite the dust by claiming four 
wickets for 65 runs besides becoming the only Pakistani captain 
after late Abdul Hafeez Kardar to beat the once mighty West Indies 
by an innings margin.
    
The last and decisive wicket, however, went to Azhar Mahmood who 
trapped master batsman Brian Lara in front of the wickets in the 
fourth over of the penultimate day. An over before, Lara was 
dropped by Mushtaq Ahmed at gully off Akram. Lara, who lasted just 
four balls today, was let off on the second ball he faced.
    
Lara was one of the four batsmen, including top scorer Sherwin 
Campbell (66), to be adjudged leg before by the 57-year-old English 
umpire David Shepherd.
    
Mushtaq Ahmed, by taking 10 wickets for 106 in the match, has 
confirmed his status as the most glittering wrist-spinner who 
adores the modern game. Mushtaq, who is one of the five Wisden 
cricketers of the year, in the current Test clinched success from 
mesmerizing spin, accuracy and bounce with deceptive googlies.
    
His instincts were to outwit the batsmen rather than wear them 
down. And his positive approach worked wonders as Carl Hooper (23) 
attempted a cover drive to be smartly caught at covers by Wasim 
Akram. Then Mushtaq deceived Phil Simmons (1) with a flipper as the 
batsman ended up skying the ball into the hands of substitute 
fielder Saqlain Mushtaq.
    
After lunch, Mushtaq had a lucky bat and pad decision against David 
Williams (20) while completing his five-wicket haul when Curtly 
Ambrose became too adventurous and danced down the track to leave 
substitute wicketkeeper Mohammad Wasim with a simple stumping.
    
On Wednesday, Mushtaq had Shivnarine Chanderpaul who was caught in 
the slips by Ijaz Ahmed after the ball had deflected the shoulder 
of Aamir Sohail who was keeping wickets. Wasim Akram, whose all 
four  victims were trapped leg before, bowled with hostility and 
fire. He proved that he was superbly fit by bowling 23 overs in 
three spells.
    
The West Indies vulnerability against quality spinner and lack of 
depth in batting was clearly exposed. After Brian Lara was the 
third batsman out in the fourth over of the day to make the 
tourists 102 for three, the remaining seven wickets went down for 
just 109 runs.
    
Clive Lloyd, the West Indies manager, may emphasize that his team 
doesn't depend only on Lara, the fact is the other way round. 
Moreover, except for Carl Hooper there is no batsman in the West 
Indies team who could easily walk into any of the top three current 
Test teams viz Australia, South Africa and Pakistan.
    
There was Philo Wallace who showed form and maturity in the four-
dayer at Rawalpindi but he was not included in the Test side for 
reasons unknown.
    
The stand of umpiring, it would not be out of context to say, 
remained below-par. Said Shah, who was standing in his debut Test, 
and David Shepherd were too generous towards the home team but if 
the West Indies go back and evaluate the Test, they would find that 
lacklustre batting in the first innings and sloppy fielding in 
Pakistan's 381 combined to end in a humiliating defeat.
