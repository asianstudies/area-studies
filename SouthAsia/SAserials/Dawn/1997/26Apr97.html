-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansar Abbasi

ISLAMABAD, April 25: Government agencies involved in the accountability 
exercise are said to be avoiding the processing of cases of alleged 
corruption or misuse of authority against members of the ruling PML, it is 
learnt.
    
Investigations into the working of the Ehtesab commission and the interior 
ministry which are directly concerned with the accountability process under 
a statute, show that neither of them has been processing the references 
against PML leaders. According to sources, the two agencies have even been 
told to lay off certain cases.
    
The sources claimed that some of the top PML leaders against whom 
references had been pending were Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Sindh Chief 
Minister Liaquat Jatoi, Punjab Assembly speaker Pervez Elahi, former chief 
minister of the NWFP Pir Syed Sabir Shah, former Balochistan chief minister 
Zulfiqar Magsi, and former Punjab minister Raja Ishfaq Sarwar.
    
Besides, a case against the NA deputy speaker, Jaffar Iqbal, was referred 
by an advocate from Multan to the Ehtesab Commissioner. But the commission 
has denied having received any formal reference in this regard.
    
A commission source, however, told this correspondent that the reference 
had actually been sent to the commission and it had been redirected to the 
provincial anti-corruption department for verification of the allegations.
    
The Ehtesab Commission has so far referred a total of 54 cases to special 
benches of the high courts for trial. These include only two references 
against the PML leaders  Chaudhry Sher Ali (MNA) and Jam Mashooq Ali 
(MNA). But both had been sent to the high courts much before the present 
government came to power.

It is learnt that the agencies concerned have been told to keep a low 
profile in some cases involving bureaucrats and other top officials. The 
case of Raana Sheikh, former MD, PTV, for instance, has been pending with 
the interior division but they have been asked not to send it to the 
Ehtesab Commission, interior ministry sources told dawn.
    
Later, the Accountability Cell of the PMs Secretariat suspended all these 
officers except the two Ahmad Riaz Shiekh and Chaudhry Sharif. The FIA 
administration, the sources said, wanted to move against these two 
officials but they had not only been saved but the authorities had also 
been asked to process the case of promotion of one of them.
    
According to one source, these officers have set the condition that they 
will only go to FIA if the incumbent director general is removed.

<a name="usmo">US move to destabilize regional security</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar 

ISLAMABAD, April 24: Pakistan has resented the US Foreign Relations 
Committee Chairmans move to seek termination of peacekeeping role along 
the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir by the United Nations Military 
Observers Group (UNMOGIP), and protested against the move to Washington and 
the UN.
    
Termination of the UNMOGIP mission, a Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman 
warned, would seriously jeopardise peace and security in a volatile region 
like South Asia and thereby seriously impair Security Councils role in the 
maintenance of peace as defined by the UN Charter.
    
The spokesman made the statement at his weekly news briefing here on 
Thursday recalling a recent reported move by Senator Jesse Helms, Chairman 
of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to link US financial support 
for the UN peace-keeping operations with interalia. Terminations of the 
UNMOGIP, which has existed for about five decades to monitor ceasefire 
violations in Jammu and Kashmir since Pakistan and India accepted ceasefire 
in the disputed State, under the UN resolutions.
    
The spokesman contended that any change in the status of UNMOGIP could only 
be brought about by a decision of the Security Council and asserted it 
cannot form part of any deal or benchmarks for UN reform. The government of 
Pakistan has taken up the matter with the United States as well as the UN 
Secretary-General Kofi Anan, he added.
    
The spokesman regretted that India had stopped cooperating with the UNMOGIP 
in the investigation of ceasefire violations for the past few years. 
However, Pakistan continued to seek UNMOGIPs assistance in investigating 
hundreds of such violations every year.
    
Responding to questions at the news briefing, the spokesman avoided 
offering any comment on the joint declaration on Wednesday in Moscow by 
visiting President Jiang Zemin and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, saying 
he would for the moment refrain from commenting on it. He hoped that this 
might be one of the subjects during talks next week in Beijing between 
President Jiang and President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari. Mr Leghari is 
visiting Beijing on April 29-30.

<a name="pafw">PAF wants extradition of officer from US</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 21: Pakistan Air Force has recommended to the ministry of 
defence that Squadron Leader Farooq should be brought back to Pakistan for 
further interrogation, sources at the defence ministry told Dawn.
    
Squadron Leader Farooq was arrested in the United States along with a 
consignment of two kilograms of heroin he had allegedly taken in an air 
force plane he had flown to the United States for bringing the arms and 
other defence equipment released under the Brown Amendment.
    
A source said Pakistan Air Force had written to the ministry of defence to 
ask the ministry of foreign affairs to take up the issue of the extradition 
of Farooq to Pakistan with US authorities.
    
Meanwhile, a joint interrogation team of the Inter Services Agency (ISI), 
Military Intelligence (MI) and Anti Narcotics Force is interrogating Sqd. 
Ld. Qasim Bhatti, the source said.
    
The source hinted at more arrests in the case adding Pakistan Air Force was 
taking every possible measure to check recurrence of any such incident in 
future. If there is another black sheep, he must be arrested in Pakistan 
instead of causing embarrassment to the country internationally, the 
source added.
    
The plane which had been taken to the United States by Farooq returned with 
the arms released by the US authorities under the Brown Amendment.

<a name="paki">Pakistan needs $1bn for wheat import</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, April 21: Pakistan needs to mobilise additional one billion 
dollars during the current calendar year to import about 4 million tons of 
wheat to bridge the gap that is expected to emerge between supply and 
demand in the next 12 months.
    
The new crop, the harvesting of which has already been started, is 
estimated at around 15-16 million tons against a total demand for 20 
million tons , including two million tons for export to Afghanistan through 
legal channels.
    
Another about a million and a half tons of wheat is needed to satisfy the 
smuggling demand which has suddenly jumped up recently due to a number of 
reasons.
    
The wheat-producing areas of Afghanistan which are located in the countrys 
north are now in the hands of anti-Kabul warlords. Next, the Ukrain wheat 
which used to meet the demands of Russia and Belorussia and deficits in 
Central Asian countries is now going towards the west. These two factors 
have made the areas beyond Pakistan in the north highly attractive for 
smugglers.
    
The current atta crisis in Pakistan is also rooted mainly in the sudden 
increase in the quantity of smuggling. The already short crop of 15 million 
tons was brought under severe pressure from the demand from countries 
across the northern border where atta was being sold between Rs 22 a kilo 
to Rs 32, against Rs 7-5 a kilo in Pakistan.

It is, however, not clear from where the government will mobilise the 
required billion dollars to import wheat to bridge the current years 
supply-demand gap.
    
And even if the required resources are mobilised for this year, the problem 
is likely to become more serious next year as the wheat deficit will 
increase further, considering the factors of population growth and fighting 
in Afghanistan. One way of getting out of the tight corner is to increase 
the acreage of wheat cultivation and use good- quality seed to improve per 
acre yield from the present 22 maund per acre to 40 per acre already 
achieved by India.
    
Experts said water for the additional wheat acreage could be made available 
by saving wastages and seepages through which nearly half of the irrigation 
water was lost.

<a name="newn">New naval base to be operational next month</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shahid Ahmed

ORMARA, April 22: A spokesman for the navy told newsmen here on Tuesday 
that the navy was planning to shift a big portion of its fleet to its 
second home at Ormara, 240 kms west of Karachi.
    
He said with the commissioning of this second naval base next month, India 
would lose some of the strategic edge it has had over Pakistan. It would 
give the Pakistan navy, the spokesman added, more reaction time in the 
event of a war.
    
The spokesman was briefing newsmen during a conducted tour of the Jinnah 
Naval Base. 

The spokesman said the new base was a dream come true as it would reduce 
the countrys dependence on Karachi and also open up the 800-km-long 
coastline to commercial exploitation.
    
He said the president would be the chief guest at the inauguration of the 
base on May 7.
 
The spokesman said Karachis proximity to the Indian coast had proved to be 
a liability in confrontations with India as it placed the countrys entire 
maritime trade at the enemys mercy. He said a road link between Karachi 
and Ormara was vital for the development of a coastal belt that offered 
easy access to the Gulf.
    
The construction of a naval harbour has at least laid a springboard and it 
is now up to both the public and private sectors to come out with plans for 
the development of the area.
    
He pointed out that the navy had considered five sites  Gwadar, Pasni, 
Ormara, Jiwani and Sonmiani  and had finally opted for Ormara because of 
its big area and natural protection from huge waves.
 
Replying to a question, he said the PN planned to shift half the 
maintenance and repair facilities from Karachi to the new base.

Ormara is a sleepy little town with a population of 10,000 on the Mekran 
coast, north of a headland jutting out into the sea. The local populace, 
subsisting mainly on fishing, had been leading a virtually primitive 
existence as late as five years ago. The town has few pucca houses and 
water supply, roads, and electricity are non-existent. The navy plans to 
generate power on its own, but at the same time it would be willing to 
share it with any private sector enterprise if and when it stepped in.

<a name="moto">Motorway project may be delayed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 20: The 334 kilometre Islamabad-Lahore motorway project 
will not be completed by Aug 31 the date given by the National Highway 
Authority, Dawn reliably learnt.
    
The briefs circulated among newsmen during a recent visit of Prime Minister 
Nawaz Sharif to the motorway had given Sept 1 as the commissioning date of 
the project. However, even the PM was not certain that the project would be 
completed by the date given by the National Highway Authority.
    
The prime minister, when asked by a journalist about the possible 
commissioning date of the project, did not reply.
    
The Daewoo has not yet handed over the land required to lay approach roads 
on both ends of the motorway. 
   
The approach roads are to be constructed at an additional cost of Rs8 
billion. The original cost of the project was Rs24 billion, excluding the 
cost of approach roads.

Besides approach roads a lot of work is still left to be done on the 
project itself. Under the original agreement, the Daewoo has to construct 
fencing on both sides of the road but later the government withdrew it and 
decided to get it done by local contractors through the National Highway 
Authority.

<a name="cons">Consortium supports Pakistans programme</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, April 23: The-Aid-to-Pakistan Consortium, which concluded its 
sessions in Paris on Wednesday, expressed continued support for Pakistan 
and indicated that financial commitments would be forthcoming in support of 
strong implementation of the programme for economic revival, recently 
announced by the Nawaz Sharif government.
    
A World Bank announcement said in Washington the Consortium, which decided 
to rename itself as Pakistan Development Forum, endorsed the continuing 
need for external resources to support Pakistans development efforts.
    
It noted the Pakistan government request for fresh commitments of $2.26 
billion during 1997-98 from members of the Consortium, the World Bank said.
    
Pakistan, it may be recalled, did not request the Consortium this year for 
specific aid pledges which may be done later in the financial year.
    
The World Bank hosted the two-day conference on Pakistans development on 
April 22-23. At the meeting of government and official donors to Pakistan, 
the government of Pakistans delegation described the comprehensive 
programme of reform measures, which it first announced during the last week 
of March.
    
The long-term economic agenda for Pakistan, including governance and 
institutional strengthening, human resource development and the 
environment, was also discussed, along with coordination of donors 
assistance programmes.
    
Mr Sartaj Aziz told the conference that Pakistan was experiencing slow 
economic growth particularly in the manufacturing sector, inflation was too 
high, exports were performing poorly, and there were balance of payments 
problems, when the new government came to power in February this year.
    
In response, the government initiated a comprehensive programme of economic 
revival aimed at instilling confidence, accelerating growth and stabilizing 
the economy, he said.
    
Ms Nishimizu described this as a bold and far-reaching structural reform 
programme that triggers a fundamental paradigm shift in Pakistans economic 
policy framework.

<a name="revi">Review of agreements on power projects</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 23: The government has constituted a six- member committee 
to review the agreements with the sponsors of all the private power 
projects numbering about 90 including the Hub power with a view to reducing 
their expected adverse impact on the balance of payments and on the 
consumers.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the government will have a fresh look at 
decisions taken by Benazir administration so as to improve these agreements 
to the countrys advantage.
    
Syed Nizam Shah has been appointed the Convener of the committee, while 
former chairman WAPDA Mr. Shamsul Mulk, Mr. Javed Akhtar, Mr. Ali Nawaz 
Memon, Mr.Shahid Sattar and Sahabzada Masood would be its members. Mr. 
Masood who is the acting managing director of Private Power and 
Infrastructure Board (PPIB) would work as the secretary of the committee.
    
According to the terms of reference of the committee, it will keep in view 
the importance of various legal obligations arising out of the power 
agreements entered into by Pakistan. It may engage the services of eminent 
legal experts to the extent necessary. The committee will be expected to 
submit its recommendations before the end of May, 1997.
    
Sources said that the committed has been set up in pursuance of the 
decision taken by prime minister Nawaz Sharif at the briefing session held 
in the ministry of Finance on April 15-16. It has been constituted on the 
orders of the minister for water and power Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan who also 
holds the duel charge of the ministry of petroleum.
    
The objective of the committee would be to suggest ways and means to cut 
the cost of private power without compromising the agreements made with 
foreign companies, Chaudhry Nisar told Dawn when asked for the reasons for 
setting up the committee.
    
It is a very major policy decision of our government because we sincerely 
believe that the power agreements should be fair and not lopsided, the 
minister said.
    
He was of the view that it was in the interest of the foreign companies 
that Nawaz Sharifs revival of economic reform package was implemented in 
letter and spirit. Unless we have a vibrant and active economy, we can not 
even hope to consume the power which is going to be produced in next two 
years. Even at the present rate of consumption we are going to have excess 
power to the tune of 1800 to 2000 MW by the year 2000, Chaudhry Nisar Ali 
Khan said.
    
He said while there would be more power than needed, its tariff would sky 
rocket sending the economy into a recessionary spin.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="acas">A case for devaluing the rupee</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Farrukh Saleem

AROUND one-eighth of our total foreign trade is conducted directly with the 
US while one-half of all our trade is denominated in the US currency. The 
rate of inflation in the US over the 7-month period commencing October 1996 
has averaged less than 0.5 per cent while the average monthly rate of 
inflation in Pakistan has been at least 1.25 per cent.
    
The Washington Post of April 10, 1997 reported ...the dollar hit a new 4.5 
year high against the Japanese yen and a three-year high versus the German 
mark, propelled by the allure of rising US interest rates. In New York 
trading the dollar settled at 126.77 yen, up from 126.52 yen Tuesday, and 
at 1.7245 marks, up from 1.7143. In Tokyo late Thursday morning, the dollar 
was trading at 126.92 yen.
    
The last official devaluation of the rupee took place more than 200 days 
ago when the State Bank of Pakistan announced a hefty depreciation of 8.5 
per cent on the 22nd of October, 1996.
    
Such an extended period of official rupee-dollar stability is an anomaly 
rather than the norm. Since that day in October, the seven month 
accumulated inflationary differential between the US and Pakistan comes to 
5.25 per cent.
    
Whether the State Bank of Pakistan likes it or not the long-term 
depreciation of the rupee would have to match the inflationary differential 
(or the terms of trade would be in a disequilibrium) of our major trading 
partners. Additionally, the US currency has found great strength on the 
back of the 0.25 per cent interest rate hike in the federal funds rate by 
the Federal Reserve (the US central bank) in its latest meeting on the 25th 
of March, 1996.
    
Market experts are now expecting further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve 
in the following months. The US dollar has simply been gaining ground 
against every major currency on the face of the planet.
    
Admittedly, the kerb market rupee-dollar parity has lately been exhibiting 
unusual strength. On the 14th and the 15th of the current month the rupee 
actually appreciated in the kerb market by a cumulative factor of some 1.25 
per cent or an economically significant Rs 0.50 per dollar in a matter of 
two days alone.
    
The considerable decline in the open-market premium over the past quarter 
also indicates that the market may not be looking towards any significant 
official devaluation. The markets should not, however, ignore that periods 
immediately preceding Eid-ul- Azha do tend to add transient vigour to the 
Pakistani rupee because of foreign workers either coming back for Eid and 
converting their dollars or Pakistani workers abroad sending back their 
savings and paychecks to their families back home.
    
This may have also caused a seasonal surplus of dollars at the money 
changers. The additional factor this time round has been the premature 
announcement of drastic cut in tariffs that would actually take effect in 
the next financial year.
    
Potential importers are holding back easing the downward pressure on the 
rupee. For the following couple of months, this factor of holding back 
imports just by itself could retard the volume of imports causing an 
artificial build-up of reserves of between $200 million to $300 million 
till the commencement of the next fiscal year.
    
The pent-up import demand is sure to surface in the months of July, August 
and September during which there shall be an added (downward) pressure on 
the countrys foreign exchange reserves as well as the rupee.
    
*From the trade-weighted standpoint, the rupee seems to have become 
overvalued by a factor of more than 5 per cent. Our exporters have already 
begun to feel the pinch. In case of a continued over-valuation most of our 
exports, especially textile goods, would gradually become uncompetitive in 
the international market and we run the risk of losing ground to our 
competitors.
    
The official policy of an over-valued rupee would also shift spending from 
domestically produced alternatives to imports. Foreign produced goods are 
giving too tough a time to locally produced supplements. The demand for 
made in Pakistan products has, at the same time been experiencing decline. 
The relative prices of domestic production as compared to imports would 
have to be adjusted sooner or later. The sooner the better.
    
The central bank must realise that using an over-valued rupee as an 
instrument of policy would worsen the already alarming trade deficit. The 
central bank must now intervene to move the terms of trade in favour of 
domestic producers before the current disequilibrium in our terms of trade 
results in an irrevocable damage to our export sector.

THE SPECTACULAR progress recorded by the East Asian economies during the 
last three decades has won applause not only from the critics and analysts 
in the East but also from the writers in the West. Jim Rohwer, in his 
celebrated book Asia rising published in the United States recently, 
describes the East Asian miracle as Thirty years of the fastest economic 
growth in history.
    
During this period (1960-1990), seven poor East Asian countries (South 
Korea, Taiwan, Singapore Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia) were 
among the dozen best performing economies in the world. In the opinion of 
the World Bank, there was only one chance in 1000 that it happened at 
random. What were the factors behind the event? Jim Rohwer expresses his 
view that despite the complexities of economic growth, its composition can 
be broken down into a mere four categories. These are (a) The quantity of 
labour (how many people are in the workeforce and how many hours they 
work); (b) the quantity of physical capital (how much land and how many 
machines, buildings and bridges) are available for the workforce to work 
with; (c) the quality of labour (how well-educated and well trained the 
workforce is) and (d) the efficiency with which the inputs of labour and 
capital are combined. The brief answers to the question of how East Asia 
succeeded in achieving its spectacular progress is that it managed to do an 
exceptionally good job at injecting these four elements of growth into its 
economies these are briefly explained here.
    
Beginning in the 1970s, the Asian workforce (defined as people aged 15 to 
64), with the major exception of housewives, started growing at a fast 
rate. This was mainly the result of an Asian baby boom that began in some 
Asian countries in the late 1950s.
    
However, the quantity of labour available to an economy, is not the only 
important factor. In some places, people work longer hours. In 1980s, for 
example, the South Korean work week was some 10 hours longer than Japans 
and more than 15 hours longer than West Germanys.
    
Yet another significant factor is that in the best performance Asian 
economies workforce participation rates rose as income went up in the 
1970s and 1980s, although that surprised some of the labour economists 
who were used to participation rates falling as incomes rose.
    
Jim Rohwer expresses his view that an abundant supply of workforce can 
actually do the opposite of what the population pessimists assumes. It can 
give a big boost to the growth of a poor economy just when it most needs 
it, subject to the condition that other things are in place to make the 
bulk of labour productive.

Capital
    
The more physical capital at the disposal of each worker (capital in the 
form of roads, machines, telephones and Computers) the more he can produce. 
The creation of physical capital depends on financial capital which results 
from the savings of people, corporations and the Government.
    
In the mid 1960s, the East Asian economies were saving only 16 per cent of 
GDP, less than Latin America. In the early 1990s, East Asia, excluding 
Japan, is saving as much as 35 per cent of GDP, four times as much as the 
Indian subcontinent and Africa and twice as much as Latin America and the 
United States.
    
Savings in East Asia went up, interalia, because East Asian governments 
created an environment in which savings could flourish. The reward of the 
saving, namely the interest rate, was left to be determined by the market 
and, therefore, the same stood at a higher level, while inflation was 
maintained at a lower level so that peoples incomes from their saving did 
not erode. In addition, East Asian governments set up institutions such as 
the postal saving banks in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan which made it 
easier for people, specially in the country side, who were not conversant 
with banks, to start saving formally.
    
Simultaneously, East Asia has been investing as much as it saved, which was 
almost 35 per cent of GDP in 1995. The East Asian governments encouraged 
private investment in several ways. Tax breaks for certain kinds of 
favoured investments were used and in some countries, notably South Korea, 
cheap credit was directed to favoured investments through the state-
controlled banking system. In most of East Asia, exchange rates and capital 
controls were used at various times to channelise domestic savings into 
investment at home when the savers might have preferred to invest abroad. 
   
Most of all, it was ensured through government trade policies that the 
prices of capital goods relative to other goods, did not rise.

Human resource
    
Among the most striking sights for any visitor to an East Asian city may be 
the multitude of uniformed school children. Much of East Asia got an 
educational jump over other poor countries in the 1960s and sped ahead at 
a fast pace by the 1980s. 
   
By the mid 1960s, the four dragons (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and South 
Korea) had achieved universal primary education. Three other East Asian 
countries namely Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia tried to follow in the 
foot steps of the leaders. By 1987, each of the dragons also enrolled at 
least three quarters of its children in secondary schools.
    
The secret behind the success of the East Asian countries in raising their 
literacy rates so quickly was that their respective governments 
concentrated their spending on primary and secondary education and they 
educated girls as well as boys. This was different from the practice 
followed in the sub-continent and Latin America where the budgets were 
lavishly spent on university education. For instance, Indonesia spent 90 
per cent of its education budget on primary schools against 40 per cent in 
Bolivia (Latin America). South Korea spent 10 per cent of its education 
budget on universities in 1985, against 43 per cent in Venezuela (Latin 
America).
    
The outstanding educational performance of the East Asian children, could, 
also be attributed to the hard work put in by them. The East Asian children 
worked harder than European children and a lot harder than the American 
children.

Total factor productivity
    
The magic element in economic growth, however, was neither the quantity and 
quality of labour nor physical capital. After a while, these factors 
started running out of steam. The supply of manpower declined and in the 
case of capital the law of diminishing returns applied, sooner or later, 
and growth slowed down or even came to a halt. 
   
The key factor in case of the East Asian economies was that they used the 
extra doses of inputs with imagination and extra ordinary efficiency. 
Technically, it may be said that the East Asian economies applied the 
inputs of labour and capital in such a way that total factor productivity 
(TFP) was maintained at a high level. In rich countries, TFP accounted for 
a third to a half of economic growth. As compared to the above, around a 
third of East Asias growth had been from the TFP, according to the world 
Banks calculations.

Lesson for Pakistan
    
Pakistan can learn a lot from the experience of the East Asian economies. 
The present government has expressed its desire to make Pakistan a global 
tiger. We have an abundant supply of manpower in the country. 
    
However, unless we educate and train our manpower to make it productive, 
unless we substantially raise our saving and invest it to create physical 
capital and unless we learn to use our limited resources judiciously for 
the development of our economy, there is no way Pakistan can think of 
becoming a global or even an Asian Tiger in the foreseeable future.

<a name="nati">National debt retirement programme: some thoughts</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Akbar

THE Pakistan Muslim League of Mian Nawaz Sharif got such a huge mandate in 
the February 3 elections that has even surprised Mian Sahib himself. In one 
of this interviews after a landsliding swap he mentioned that the margin of 
his victory was beyond his expectations. In any other country or in any 
other circumstances this type of mandate could have been taken as a very 
healthy and welcome change which would have automatically followed a change 
in the right direction for the economy and for the people of the country.
    
In case of Pakistan, unfortunately, this is not the case. Where such huge 
mandate just baffles the electorate, and also makes it extremely difficult 
for those who were given that type of mandate to come up to the 
expectations and to be able to deliver. The remedies and solutions to the 
complicated and multi dimensional problems that our economy face today are 
not all that straight forward.
    
To put back on track a derailed economy, we need extraordinary people with 
extraordinary will and competence. We hardly see any new faces. Finally and 
most importantly it is the intensions and the motivation that counts the 
most. Good intension and sincerity, however, could be a necessary condition 
but it may not be sufficient condition to solve such paramount problems. 
   
What is also needed is competence. If the presence of both these 
conditions, that is will and ability are in doubt then the honey moon gets 
over quit shortly.
    
The most popular and well-known problem that our economy face today among 
host of other issues is that of debt, both internal and external. Debt 
problem, especially foreign debt has been an issue not only for Pakistan 
but for most of other developing countries as well. 
   
It is generally observed that the recipient countries are often solely held 
responsible, by both the people of this country and the done countries for 
the problems arising out of this foreign debt phenomena. What we generally 
tend to forget is the fact that there is another party involved in the 
business which has her own perception and motives behind this whole 
exercise. 
   
Foreign aid, as different major donors have often said, constitutes a 
distinct benefit to their business. Many countries are oriented towards 
free enterprise in which firms of the donor countries can proper.
    
The institutions providing funds, especially the two most powerful, the 
World Bank and the IMF, insists that their advice is purely technical, 
cost-free and objective. But in fact the recommendations made by them 
follow a predictable pattern, which accord with an easily recognisable 
right-wing ideology and which, as has recently been the case with Pakistan, 
at times caused considerable hardship to the recipient countries.
    
The conditions that these agencies attach to their lending are some times 
precisely quantifiable; for example, the govt. of the recipient country 
must devalue its currency, reduce restriction on imports, etc. The major 
purpose of these conditions is to ensure smooth functioning of the system, 
financial stability, and the avoidance of debt default etc.
    
The objective of foreign aid to Pakistan, supposedly, was to develop the 
Socio-economic infrastructure which in turn helps to sustain a growth 
process which is meant to reduce countrys dependence on foreign aid. We 
have not only failed to achieve this objective but have also given rise to 
an industrial structure which is highly capital intensive. Moreover the 
terms and conditions attached to aid were not to promote economic growth 
but to further economic interests of the donors countries. Why we agreed to 
that kind of terms and conditions is a separate issue.
    
The rapid deterioration during the 80s in the budgetary position of the 
government of Pakistan has led to increased resort both to domestic and 
external borrowing. This has caused rapid growth in outstanding debt and in 
the associated interest and repayment liabilities. In light of these 
adverse trends, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) imposed 
conditionalities on the government in 1988 as part of the medium term 
structural adjustment programme (SAF). 
  
The basic objective of these conditionalities was to bring down the sixes 
of the budgetary deficit as a percentage of the GDP and there by reduce the 
need for incremental borrowing. In this way the debt servicing burden can 
be kept within manageable limits. The IMF concern naturally was that if the 
deficit continues to increase then there is the danger that Pakistan will 
eventually default in meeting its debt servicing obligations, which is the 
only concern of these donor agencies.
    
However, despite all these SAF and ESAF programmes and conditionalities the 
external debt kept on increasing due to sheer mismanagement and 
incompetence of different governments. The aggregate external debt of 
Pakistan has grown from US$ 3.75 billion in 1972-73 to US$ 15.2 billion in 
1990 and to US$ 28 billion in 1997 almost doubled in last six years. There 
has been a systematic divergence between net revenue receipts as a 
percentage of GDP and total public expenditure on the federal account as 
percentages of GDP. Both ratios have increased but former has increased 
more than the later. As a consequence the ratio of the budgetary deficit of 
GDP has shown a tendency t o rise, reaching the peak level of 8.6 per cent 
in 19887-88.
    
Altogether, at the time when the IMF conditionalities were imposed in 1988-
89, the country had been through a period of profliage spending and 
inflation had began to acquire a run away tendency, with the consumer price 
index growing at a double digit rate for the first time since the 70s. With 
or without the IMF conditionalities, it was clear that the time had come to 
exercise fiscal restraints.
    
During 1988-90 this fiscal restraint was successfully exercised by the 
first Benazir government in which expenditure were controlled and the 
budgetary deficit as percentage of GDP was reduced considerably.
    
The accompany table clearly shows that if budgetary deficit as percentage 
of GDP is any indicator or barometer for economic management, then Benazir 
government on both the occasions had definitely performed much better then 
the Muslim League Government. Most of the outstanding debt in the recent 
years is accumulated in the early 90s when the budgetary deficit was more 
then 8 per cent of GDP.
    
This is the brief history of how in we have managed our economy as a 
result of which we are in such a dire state of affairs. Mian Nawaz Sharif, 
whose Pakistan Muslim League has once again scored a big victory in the 
February 3 elections, has started off with a very novel cure for this debt 
repayment issue. First, he has appealed to every Pakistani abroad to send 
US$ 1000/- to saving accounts at home in an effort to reduce the balance of 
payment deficit from a record 6.6 percent of the GDP to 4.4 per cent this 
year. 
   
Then, in his address to the nation after assuming office for the second 
time he has presented a programme popularly known as NDRP (National Debt 
Retirement Programme). In view of many neutral economic experts it is more 
of a Gimmickry then any serious effort to solve the problem. It is easy to 
sceptical and to pick holes but carping criticism in a situation like this 
would be out of place. However it is necessary to asses the issue and its 
possible remedies more realistically.
    
The Prime Minister in his programme has given three options, namely 
donations, Qarz-e-Hasana and fixed deposits for two years at a rate of 
return higher than the going market rate. The most optimistic projections 
reckon that this appeal for debt retirement would bring in minimum of $ 300 
million and a maximum of $ 500 million by the end of June 97. Also it will 
be a one shot item with no follow up on an annual basis. Remittances are 
steadily declining 80 to 90 percent of the Pakistanis living abroad belong 
to a working class and they simply cannot afford what Mian Sahib is asking 
for. Therefore, according to the most conservative estimate the expected 
amount should not be more then 50 to 60 million. But the question is: What 
after that? This amount is not going to be a regular feature of our income. 
The finance minister has mentioned in one of his statements that under the 
programme government has managed to mop up only $ 130 million from both 
within and outside Pakistan. And of the three option bulk of the money has 
come under fixed deposits. It seems that the strategy will not only fail to 
achieve its objectives in meeting the countrys immediate debt obligations 
which is in the range or US $ 500 million. But it will further aggravate 
the already alarming balance of payment and debt servicing issue two years 
down the road when these fixed deposits will reach their maturity period at 
an interest rate higher then the going market rate.
    
It is hard to under stand how does new government plan to take care of the 
future expenditure which are bond to go up consistently unless defence 
expenditure in reviewed, and population explosion is controlled. 
    
What we really need to concentrate at is our tax administrations. We have 
been suffering from debt burden because we have not been able to prioritise 
our needs. We have not been able to earn enough to finance our socio- 
economic and defence requirements. 
   
The real problem that own economy face today is tax evasion. Has anybody 
asked these big shots (including the prime minister himself) that come 
every day on television and announce huge sums in prime minister scheme, 
about their sources of income and how much tax they pay every year. Had 
they been paying only 50 percent of their tax liability, we would not have 
gotten to such a sorry state of affairs.

<a name="them">The miserly rich, the stingy feudals</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

SMALL MEN have given generously to the prime ministers national debt 
reduction fund, while the rich are hesitating and giving tactfully and the 
feudal have almost refused to make any donations even weeks after Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif issued his appeal to Pakistanis at home and overseas 
for help.
    
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz told the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of 
Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) on Saturday that $200 million had been 
received so far and out of that 20 per cent were donations, five per cent 
Qarz-i-Hasna payments and the remainder - 75 per cent  monetary deposits 
that enjoy the announced enhanced interest rates.
    
He also said that out of these deposits $52 million were taken out of the 
foreign exchange deposits of Pakistanis in our banks and $25 million out of 
that were given as donations to the debt reduction fund.
    
He said the government did not favour people taking money out of the old 
foreign exchange deposits and depositing them in the PMs fund as that 
meant the government giving back the same foreign exchange deposits which 
it had already used by one hand and receiving the same by the other hand. 
However, in respect of the money withdrawn from the old deposits and given 
to the government as out right donation its foreign exchange liabilities 
are reduced to that extent and the banks have to pay no interest on that 
score.
    
Resident and overseas Pakistanis have a total deposit of $8.5 billion in 
Pakistani banks and the government has used all these funds as the foreign 
exchange has to be remitted to the State Bank of Pakistan immediately after 
that is received by the banks. The State Bank provides the banks with 
rupees which it can use for lending at high interest rates. But when a 
depositor withdraws his dollars the State Bank has to provide the dollars 
needed.
    
The Finance Minister did not say how much out of the equivalent of $200 
million received so far is in foreign exchange and how much in rupees as 
the total includes small amounts given by a large number of Pakistanis at 
home as ones days salary or more and considerable overall rupee 
donations.
    
When the Prime Minister announced his scheme on February 23 to pay off 
every cent for the countrys betterment the expectation was the total of 
the three schemes would be around $2 billion, which though small compared 
to the total foreign exchange debt of $40 billion, was a sizable sum, and 
that would mark a good beginning in the efforts of the nation to reduce the 
colossal national debt and increase self-reliance. And while more was 
expected as foreign exchange deposits for two years, if not the maximum of 
five years, the PM said the State Bank of Pakistan would guarantee all such 
deposits and interest on them would be paid every three months which, in 
fact, would enhance the annual rate of interest. And the interest rate was 
raised from the 6 to 6.4 per cent per year to 7.5 per cent each year for 
two years. And the rate rose by half a per cent for each year to 9 per cent 
for five years.
    
The immediate interest of the government was a two-year relief and 
meanwhile pay off some of the heavy short-term borrowing by the Benazir 
government and the caretaker set-up. The caretakers are reported to have 
borrowed over $2 billion as short-term loans at high interest rates.
    
The popular response to the PMs appeal has been touching. He had spoken of 
a little boy with his five dollars who was determined to hand it over to 
him, of widows who had made large donations and Mr Sartaj Aziz spoke of an 
unemployed man with Rs 100 who gave it to the national cause. However, the 
response of the rich persons to the appeal has been inadequate and Mr 
Sartaj Aziz confessed that at the FPCCI headquarters. He said the amount 
received despite such popular enthusiasm and touching sentiments at the 
poor peoples level had been far less than expected.

Poor response
    
The response of overseas Pakistanis has not been good either. Mr Ejazul Haq 
led a delegation to the UAE and announced he expected $50 million from 
there. The mission which went to the US led by Lt. Gen. (retd) Majeed Malik 
received pledges for $40 billion but clearly the total received so far is 
far below the $90 million even when good returns have been assured for 
their deposits.
    
When the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) announced Rs 10 
million at the Businessmens Convention addressed by the PM, he brushed 
aside that offer saying APTMA was capable of much larger payments. It later 
spoke of Rs 30 million but not much has been heard about that since then.
    
Mr S.M. Muneer, former President of the FPCCI and minister in the Benazir 
government announced $1 million earlier and has repeated that several 
times, including when Mr Sartaj Aziz addressed the Karachi Chamber of 
Commerce last week and that gave the impression that he had donated or 
deposited several million dollars, which is not true.

Miserly feudals
    
When it came to the feudal lords, hardly anyone made any donation. A few of 
them who appeared on PTV said they had no money at all, including the top 
dignitary of the State. 
    
The question asked is: why do Pakistanis who hold total deposits of $8.5 
billion in our banks not want to transfer some of that to the PMs fund and 
get higher returns and on a quarterly basis instead of the normal six 
monthly basis.
    
The reason is the bigger depositors, particularly industrialists and 
businessmen, have obtained rupee loans of up to 90 per cent of their 
deposits at concessional interest of 15 to 17 per cent while the normal 
rate of interest is 22 to 25 per cent. And they uses this money for 
trading, speculation and dealing in property etc., and so they cant 
transfer their deposits to the PMs fund now despite the higher interest it 
offers. Some others do not want to tie up their dollar deposits for two 
years as they may need it for commercial transactions or other purposes.
    
But the government wants a breathing space of at least two years before 
such amounts have to be paid back and that is not a very long period to ask 
for.
    
What is likely to happen now is that some of the employees in the private 
sector and others who had pledged to donate one days salary every month 
until the end of the year may not do likewise. 
    
They may ask that if the feudal lords who have prospered in this country 
and rule it, and the rich industrialists and businessmen would not give 
generously to the national cause why must they continue to make sacrifices 
for the nation?
    
The prime ministers cannot go much further than he has done in offering 
attractive and guaranteed returns on the deposits the rich may make. And he 
has promised to send letters of appreciation to those who send $100,000 and 
above and give gold medals to those who send a million dollars and above 
which means Rs 40 million and above.

Stingy industrialists
    
What is striking is that while the businessmen and industrialists rejoice 
over the fact they now a real businessmens government and as many as 35 
businessmen are in the National Assembly alone, their response to the PMs 
appeal has been poor, and too poor, compared to the popular response or 
donations of the low income groups.
    
Earlier a few of the persons wanting to give Rs 10 million or more from 
Karachi, had wanted to present the cheque personally to the PM, but they 
were told to send the cheque to Islamabad as the PM did not have the time 
to meet them. But he is well advised to meet small groups of 10 to 12 at 
brief tea parties as he tours the country and receive the money personally 
and give them the benefit of the publicity they may seek if the amount is 
substantial.
    
And, if the FPCCI could pool all the demands and implorations of its 
affiliate chambers and associations and press the government to accept 
them, its President, Ilyas Bilour, and other officials can mobilise a large 
fund from its affiliate bodies.
    
For the time being, the PM says he is holding on to the fund he has 
collected and is not letting that be used for any other purpose.
    
For any kind of debt reduction proper, he needs far more funds and affluent 
Pakistanis overseas and rich Pakistanis at home have to come to the rescue 
of the country now when Pakistan is not asking for any pledges at this 
months meeting of the Aid to Pakistan Consortium in Paris for $2.8 billion 
but only submitting its proposals and projects and would wait until after 
the annual budget for pledging, unlike in the past when the pledges were 
made long before the budget.
    
Clearly the donors want to see the shape of the budget and effective budget 
deficit reduction measures and positive steps to revitalise the economy 
before they pledge their aid for next year. So prior to that, Pakistanis 
have to make the PMs efforts at promoting self-reliance substantial and a 
sustained success.

<a name="prov">Provinces to get Rs1203bn from pool money in five years</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 21: The federal government will disburse Rs1203.61 billion 
among the four provinces during the next five years in the form of 
divisible pool transfers, straight transfers and special 
grants/subventions, according to National Finance Commission award (NFC).
    
*From the divisible pool of Rs1005.48 billion, the four federating units 
would get Rs 139.61 billion in fiscal 1997/98 beginning July 1; Rs165.00 
billion in 1998/99; Rs195.22 billion in 1999/2000; Rs231.30 billion in 
2000/2001 and Rs274.35 billion in 2001/2002.
    
It may be mentioned, that the Rs1005.48 billion to be distributed by the 
centre among the four provinces from the divisible pool in the next five 
years is, only 37.5 per cent of the net proceeds of the divisible pool and 
the remaining 62.5 per cent would be spent by the federal government.
    
The money would be divided among the provinces according to their 
population based on the 1981 census. The shares would be worked out again 
when new ratios of population would be finally adopted after the next 
census.
    
According to the formula adopted by the NFC for the distribution of 
divisible pool, Punjab would get 57.88 per cent of the total share of the 
four provinces; Sindh 23.28 per cent; the NWFP 13.54 per cent and 
Balochistan 5.30 per cent.

<a name="newg">New gas reserve discovered in Khirthar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, April 20: A huge natural gas reserve, the first in the Khirthar 
range, and most probably the second largest ever to be discovered in 
Pakistan, is likely to be tapped soon, according to preliminary estimates 
of the exploration well drilled recently by a joint-venture company.
    
The sources close to the joint venture, which is led by a British oil and 
gas firm exploring the Khirthar mountain range, had indicated the reserves 
running up to a trillion cubic feet of gas while the assessments done in 
London speak of more than two trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. 
   
However, in the final assessment, the estimates could go up to 8 trillion 
cubic feet which would be just about two trillion less than that of the Sui 
field reserves discovered in 1952.

Secretary petroleum, Dr Gulfaraz Ahmad, seemed over-cautious while talking 
to Dawn about the new discovery. He said that he would not be able to say 
anything about the potential of the field until and unless the second well 
is drilled.
    
He indicated that more significant than the potential reserves of the field 
is the fact that gas has been discovered in a new range (Khirthar). He said 
Sui and Pirkoh were located in one range while Attock, Dakhni, etc, in the 
other range, and now we have a third range which has shown gas potential.
    
A recent study has estimated the potential gas reserves of Pakistan so far 
to be 200 trillion cubic feet. Earlier studies had said that Pakistan 
contained a large basinal area with discovered/proven gas reserves of 30 
trillion cubic feet.

<a name="fore">Foreclosure laws to recover loans</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, April 21: The PML government will soon introduce foreclosure 
laws to recover loans through the liquidation of assets without following 
the long litigation process.
    
I have today met the advisor on law and parliamentary affairs to discuss 
early introduction of foreclosure laws and recover state money from those 
who do not pay back their loans, said the minister for commerce and 
investment Mr Ishaq Dar.
    
In an interview with Dawn here on Monday, he said that he has proposed to 
the government that there should be strict foreclosure laws that should 
liquidate the assets of the defaulters of loans without any loss of time. 
I have also proposed that there should be strict laws to prevent the 
bouncing of cheques as is done in many countries, he added.
    
The commerce minister said that the government was currently involved in 
finalizing foreclosure laws to recover huge loans and that the issue would 
be taken up with full force.
    
There is no hope for the settlement of thousands of cases of litigation 
without having foreclosure laws, he said adding that time has come when 
there should not be any lapses in early recovery of the state funds.

<a name="imme">Immediate privatization of PTCL doubtful</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

ISLAMABAD, April 23: Privatization of Pakistan Telecom Ltd (PTCL), in the 
near future, has become highly doubtful in view of its declining 
profitability and lack of buyer interest in an enterprise whose future 
viability has become uncertain due to the fast paced developments taking 
place in information technology.
    
According to one estimate, the elusive strategic buyer whose search is on 
for the last two years will have to mobilise more than a billion dollars to 
lift 26 per cent of the PTCL shares.
    
First, it is the declining profitability of the organization, which has 
reportedly kept the intending buyers away from the PTCL.
    
Then they reportedly lost all interest in the enterprise following its 
reorganization in which it has been denuded of most of its important 
customers. Even the microwave system has been transferred to the National 
Telecommunication Company created recently to secure the local sensitive 
services of the civil and military sectors.
    
And finally, the future viability of the organization became highly 
uncertain when Pakistan early this year signed the WTO agreement on 
telecommunication which would liberate the service inside the country in 
2004 forcing serious tariff cuts. Already, the PTCL has agreed to reduce by 
18 per cent the international rates with two US carriers in two tranches.
    
Concerned quarters have already started taking a look at the matter from an 
entirely a new angle which entails rendering the PTCL totally autonomous 
with the  government relinquishing its claim on the Rs 6 billion of the 
organizations annual revenue as its share of profits.
    
Experts in the field are proposing that if at all privatization has to be 
done then, it could be taken in hand by breaking up the corporation in 
various economically viable circuits like the Karachi circuit and Lahore 
circuit etc. These packages, they said would be affordable even for the 
local investor to buy either on his own or by establishing joint ventures 
or consortias.
    
But before undertaking this exercise, they said it was essential to frame a 
regulatory authority armed with laws  which while not stifling the sector 
would, however, protect the countrys sovereignty and its independence of 
action.
    
In this connection, they said since the information technology has 
revolutionized the entire concept of telecommunication and information 
making the two too much interdependent, it has become necessary at this 
juncture to merge the ministries of telecommunication, information and 
science and technology so that when the laws and regulations are made in 
this regard an unified line of thought is taken rather than the present 
fragmented approach which had resulted in the promulgation of a defective 
ordinance (electronic media regulatory authority) during the caretaker 
government.

<a name="dono">Donors happy over economic restructuring</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shadaba Islam

BRUSSELS, April 24: What a difference a new government makes. A year ago, 
Western aid donors more or less pouted their way through the World Banks 
annual assessment of Pakistans economy, making it clear that Islamabad 
would have to do more much more to prove it was committed to serious 
economic reform. The changes were never made. Not surprisingly, neither the 
World Bank nor the International Monetary Fund shed any tears when Benazir 
Bhutto was removed from office last November.
    
Switch to this weeks meeting in Paris and you notice a visible change in 
donors attitude. Officials from the World Bank, the European Union 
countries and others congratulated Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz for what 
World Bank Vice-President Mieko Nishimizu described as a bold and far-
reaching structural reform programme that triggers a fundamental paradigm 
shift in Pakistans economic policy framework.
    
We are impressed by the new governments policy decisions, another World 
Bank official commented. This is not just window-dressing.
    
Compliments are all very well, but, clearly, the proof of the pudding will 
be in the eating. Donors will be watching carefully to see if the 
impressive economic revival programme is implemented as planned. The test 
is how these reforms are put into effect, the World Bank official said.
    
Western governments have taken note of the Pakistans request for 2.2 
billion dollars in fresh commitments. But, the actual pledges as expected 
wont come until later.

Mr Aziz told Dawn that he had asked for understanding from donors, 
arguing that while Pakistan was moving in the right direction to bring down 
the deficits, they should not expect quick results.
    
Donors were surprised at our awareness of the problem, Aziz said, adding 
that a similar appeal for more comprehension and time would also be put to 
the IMF.

For the moment, Western donors appear convinced that after years of 
ramshackle government, Pakistan is finally coming to grips with its 
economic problems.

<a name="most">Most MNCs remain under pressure on KSE</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 25: Index shares on Friday came in for active support in 
what the dealers called a belated reaction to the consortiums positive 
signals and a clean bill of health for the governments economic policies 
from the donor countries. The KSE 100-share recovered about 17 points at 
1,538.01.
    
The broader market was, however, not that responsive apparently owing to 
weekend considerations but there were signs of recovery on most of the blue 
chip counters, dealers said.
    
Although there were no massive activities on the current favourites, 
instances of active short-covering at the lower levels were not wanting, 
which in turn aided the underlying sentiment, they added.
    
However, fears of further devaluation of the rupee were there and this 
perception was further reinforced by one per cent decline in the value of 
the rupee in kerb at Rs 41.35 and 41.45 for buying and selling 
respectively. The net decline was of the order of 25 paisa over the 
previous close.
    
They said any rally at the weekend session pointed to the advent of a bull-
run next week and there is a strong possibility of a big rebound after 
trading resumes next week.
    
Some others said the broader market should have joined hands with the 
consolidation forces but stayed away owing to the news of sectarian 
killings in the Punjab and fears of their fallout here.
    
The index was last quoted around 1,538.01 points as compared to 1,521.37 a 
day earlier, recovering 16.64 points thanks to active buying in most of the 
index shares.
    
Most of the leading bank shares came in for active support at the 
attractively lower and generally finished recovered, although fractionally 
under the lead of Platinum, Schon, Soneri Bank, MCB and Bank Al-Habib.
    
Insurance shares followed them rising modestly, major gainers among them 
being PTC, Adamjee Insurance and some others, but textiles shares fell 
fractionally across the board for want of buying.
    
Cement, energy and chemicals shares performed well on active short-covering 
but there were not many major gains as price changes were fractional, 
reflecting that the current improvement could be sustained next week.
    
However, the weakness of the leading MNCs weighed heavily against the 
underlying sentiment as foreign funds were not that aggressive buyers.
    
Volume was, however, light owing to a short Friday session, falling to 32 
million shares from the previous 40 million shares but losers maintained a 
strong lead over the gainers at 128 to 94, with 77 shares holding on to the 
last levels.
    
Bulk of the support remained confined to the current favourites as 
investors were not inclined to jump to the bandwagon partly because of 
weekend considerations.
    
PTC vouchers, which have been under massive selling for the last four 
sessions, recovered 80 paisa at Rs 26.40 on volume of 13 million shares, a 
half of the total.
    
Hub-Power, ICI Pakistan and Dewan Salman followed them amid active short-
covering and were quoted modestly higher.
    
The big gainers were led by PSO, which was close to Rs 300 mark owing to 
persistent rise during the last few sessions on active short-covering by 
some foreign investors.
    
MCB, Bank Al-Habib, Sui Northern, Johnson and Philips EMCO and Diamond 
Industries were among the other prominent gainers.
    
Most of the MNCs remained under pressure and eased further though modestly 
under the lead of Burshane Pakistan, Dawood Hercules, Knoll, Parke-Davis 
and Siemens Pakistan, falling by one rupee to Rs 3. But the biggest loss 
was noted in Abbott Lab, which fell by Rs 10 on selling prompted by the 
news of lower interim profit.
    
Apart from PTC, the most active list was topped by Hub-Power, up 65 paisa 
on 6.015 million shares followed by ICI Pakistan, higher 40 paisa on 5.075 
million shares, Dewan Salman, firm 20 paisa on 1.021 million shares and 
FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, higher 35 paisa on 0.354 million shares.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

THEIR bills, we pay. As to the power they exercise over us, we have no say 
as to its use.
    
Such is the source of our existing profound instability. Be they our 
elected representatives (who, judging from their medical expenses which we 
bear, would all seem to be so sick as to be almost on their last legs), be 
they bureaucrats, or uniformed officers, they are mostly selfish and 
greedy, with no time for the well-being of the people, and too many of them 
are corrupt.
    
The people can but protest. The government has finally taken a lame limp 
step forward to advance the accountability process. Fiscal institutions, 
the nationalised banks and DFIs, the holders in trust of the peoples 
money, are the main repositories from which the politicians, aided and 
abetted by the bureaucrats, enrich themselves and their friends, knowing 
fully well when loans are given that there is no chance of recovering even 
half of what is lent, let alone the servicing charges. Influentials have 
loans rescheduled, the wily have them converted into non-voting shares, 
which the government money manipulators willingly accept, knowing they are 
but worthless pieces of paper.
    
Take the case of the sacred National Investment Trust, eligible to hold 
pension funds. In 1993, when Kunwar Idris, the then senior-most secretary 
of the federal government, retired from the chairmanship of the NIT, Prime 
Minister Benazir Bhutto, appointed Asadullah Shaikh, a man with no 
experience of banking or of finance, to head that institution.
    
The regulatory authority, the State Bank of Pakistan, was silent on 
Asadullahs appointment, as it was silent when he fled our shores last year 
having impoverished the NIT after enriching himself and his masters. The 
new man, Raziur Rahman, took over without counting what was left in his 
counting-house and now has no money to pay his unit-holders who are asking 
for their units to be encashed. He is even issuing cheques which bounce - a 
crime in any country.
    
Then there is the Muslim Commercial Bank, with its head office in Karachi, 
and over 500 branches scattered around this country and abroad. Its chief 
executive, Hussain Lawai, was shot out by Legharis caretakers. Since then, 
the bank is being run without a president or chief executive, its affairs 
supervised by its non-executive chairman. On March 28 this year the State 
Bank wrote to the MCB on the subject of the Appointment of President and 
Chief Executive:
    
Please refer to your letter of March 19, 1997, on the subject cited above. 
In this connection we have to advise that the matter of appointing a 
professional banker as the President may be expedited. However, the State 
Bank has no objection to the continuation of Mian Mohammed Mansha till 
such appointment is effected which under no circumstances should take more 
than a year. Infact, State Bank of Pakistan would expect it to be done much 
earlier.
    
Mansha, an able and hard-working man who presides over the fortunes of a 
dozen large business and industrial enterprises, is not a professional 
banker and cannot devote sufficient time to the MCB. No bank can be run 
efficiently without a full-time chief executive. Such is the present 
practice of accountability.
    
This leads me to Kunwar Idriss column published in this newspaper on April 
14, and particularly to his sentences The accountability, for a while 
believed to have been shelved, has started but at the wrong end and in the 
wrong hands. Its first target should have been the tainted politicians. The 
bureaucrats had played but second-fiddle to them in the game of high 
corruption, at least since 1989 when the parliamentary system was fully 
restored.
    
I do not agree with my good friend Kunwar Idris, for whom I have a lot of 
time. He is an honest man.
    
Born in Sialkot in 1933, he went to school wherever his father, a sessions 
judge, was posted, to Gordon College in the hills, and on to Government 
College, Lahore. He was selected by the Federal Public Services Commission, 
opted for the Civil Service of Pakistan and was enrolled in 1957. He spent 
a year in the Civil Services Academy in Lahore. Thereafter he was posted 
for a few months in Comilla, East Pakistan, as a trainee/assistant 
magistrate, 3rd Class, where he learnt Bengali. In 1959 he was sent to 
Jesus College, Cambridge. He returned to be posted to the tribal areas 
where he spent seven years learning Pashto and Khowar and the psychology of 
the primitive Mohmands, who were kept uneducated by the countrys rulers 
and had a literacy rate of 0.5 per cent. He was an assistant commissioner, 
a political agent, and chief adviser to Saif-ul-Mulk, the minor ruler of 
Chitral state. He was shot at twice by the tribesmen, not to kill him, but 
just to advise him that they were not totally enamoured of his incursions 
in their domain.
    
In 1966 he returned to the Plains of Lahore as director of mineral 
resources. He was in this post for only a few months. General Ayubs son-
in-law Najibullah and General Musas brother Sardar Ishaq both wanted all 
possible bajri concessions and both decided that Idris would do neither of 
them any good, so he was shot out.
    
He came to Karachi in 1967 as director of excise and taxation, in which 
post he remained for two years. In 1969 he was promoted to district 
magistrate, staying in Karachi for a further four years. Those were 
turbulent six years, under Ahyub, Yahya and Bhutto. The first two never 
asked him to do anything out of line, and on the rare occasion when he was 
requested to do something not quite kosher, on his pointing it out to them 
they willingly gave in. When DM, before dawn one day in 1972, a terrorized 
SDM, Mumtaz Baig, awoke him to inform him of what had transpired during 
that night. He had been hauled out of his house by Home Secretary Mohammed 
Khan Junejo, taken to Altaf Gauhars house where he saw the police plant a 
suitcase containing an old Playboy, half a bottle of whisky, a forged 
passport, travel papers, and a few packets of contraceptives, on which 
evidence he was instructed to order Altafs arrest. Idris asked whether 
he had come to lodge a complaint about the wrong he had been forced to do. 
No, said the frightened SDM. He was a religious man and was confessing, 
hoping to ease his conscience.
    
*From 1973 onwards Idris remained in Sindh as secretary of various 
departments. He served as home secretary under Generals Jehanzeb, Iqbal and 
Abbasi, all governors of Sindh. In General Iqbals time, in 1978, he 
allowed Benazirs friend Victoria Schofield to stay with her at 70 Clifton 
where she was under house arrest. Zia was furious with Idris, but Iqbal 
took full responsibility for his officers conduct and stood by him.
    
In 1981 he left Karachi for Islamabad and was posted as additional 
secretary to various federal ministries. In 1985 he returned to Karachi to 
head the Pakistan Automobile Corporation. In 1988 Benazir insisted on 
making him chief secretary of Sindh under Qaim ali Shah, a tough and nasty 
job as he was told by Benazir that when her husband spoke it must be taken 
that she has spoken and his orders must take precedence over all else. 
Within a year, Idris unwilling to oblige, was shunted out to Bankers Equity 
as its president.
    
In Nawazs first round, as secretary of the ministry of production, Idris 
was OSDeed for a few months for having raised the price of cement. He was 
brought back as secretary of the petroleum ministry and again OSDeed by 
Chaudhry Nisar for being too independent.
    
In 1993 he returned to Karachi to head the NIT. He retired on his sixtieth 
birthday. As form and custom dictate, he duly wrote off to Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto asking for an appointment to say goodbye. Months went by and 
finally he received a letter from a flunkie telling him the PM was far too 
busy but should he have a grievance he could see her deputy secretary.
    
In 1996, the caretaker chief minister of Sindh, Mumtaz Bhutto, inducted 
Kunwar Idris as his senior minister and posted that other honest and God-
fearing serving bureaucrat, Noor Ahmed Shah as his principal secretary, 
both appointments lending credibility to Mumtazs administration. The fact 
that in 1997, the succeeding elected Chief Minister Liaquat Jatoi could not 
afford to retain Noor Ahmed in his secretariat has augmented the latters 
reputation.

<a name="acco">Accountability with justice</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

THAT thorough accountability should be carried out is the demand of most 
people. It is a demand that has taken the form of a battle-cry. That this 
accountability should be all-embracing rather than selective is what 
natural justice would require.
    
At no time should this accountability become a witch-hunt or seem to be 
vindictive if what we seek is a moral cleansing of our society. What is 
even more important is that it should be depoliticised and there should be 
a respect shown for the due process of law. The primary objective should be 
to nail those who are guilty of corruption but the methods should not be 
pre-emptive and should be based on the assumption of innocence with the 
burden of proof lying with those who are framing the charges or making the 
allegations. Perceptions and newspaper reports may be the smoke that shows 
the likelihood of a fire but in themselves do not constitute evidence. We 
have to get it right and what should emerge in the end is a respect for the 
law.
    
We need too to examine whether corruption is a cause or is it an effect. 
Not quite whether the chicken came first or the egg. But those social 
forces that influence the conduct of people. There is first of all the 
greed factor and there is nothing that can be done to change human nature. 
But were there adequate checks and balances in the system that could have 
put some impediments in the way of the greedy?
    
In Black Moods which was a collection of columns I wrote in 1956, that is 
to say 41 years ago, I had wondered how it was possible for a man to live 
beyond his means. I had asked: have two and two stopped making four? I had 
speculated that people who lived beyond their means had, perhaps, acquired 
the powers of alchemy, transmuting the lead of their income into the gold 
of luxurious living. This kind of evidence has been before our eyes. Had 
some preventive measures been taken then, some kind of institutional 
disapproval could have been established. Things have gone progressively 
worse and what had then seemed like a trickle has become a flood.
    
The rules of doing business with the government were made so cumbersome and 
the babu mentality, so entrenched, made into a state-of-the-art, that the 
only way one could get anything accomplished, even getting something as 
lowly as a passport, was to pay a sort of unofficial tax, not to the 
government but to a servant of the government. To this day, no one has seen 
fit to simplify government rules, to make them result-oriented. Now we are 
in a Catch-22. To simplify the rules would mean depriving thousands of low 
level functionaries, the file-pushers, of a livelihood. Like overtime, this 
little bit of baksheesh has become an integral part of the take-home pay 
packet. This is the level of corruption that most affects the common folk. 
They are not only pushed around, made to appear like supplicants even to 
get what is rightfully theirs but they must pay in the bargin. It is even 
argued, and not facetiously, that without this kind of illegal (?) 
gratification the machinery of government would come to a standstill.
    
An advertisement has been appearing in the newspapers issued by the Ehtesab 
Cell of the Prime Ministers Secretariat. It is possible that it is an 
entirely well meaning message. But there is a menacing ring to it. The 
advertisement is an invitation to provide information of any known wrong-
doing by employees of such organisations as WAPDA, Customs, Income Tax, 
Police, Civil Administration, PIA, Railways, Pakistan steel, Development 
Authorities, Communications or other government organisations. The 
advertisement further offers that if you wish your name and identity not to 
be disclosed, it will not. And that the first one to provide correct 
information will receive 10% of the recovered wealth as reward.
    
We are skating on thin ice. If someone has genuine information, he should 
be prepared to come forward. It is a cardinal principle of law that an 
accuser should face the accused. The offer of a reward sends the wrong 
message. But most of all, the advertisement provides no information about 
penalties for making false accusations, accusations that may be motivated 
by malice or point scoring or just getting even with ones superiors. No 
one should be encouraged to bear false witness and unless some safeguards 
are provided, we will be opening up a can of worms. We should not turn 
employees of these organisations into informers. We are putting an 
immense amount of authority in the hands of employees without any 
responsibility. This could become a dangerous precedent.
    
I had written in earlier columns that the menace in accountability should 
be removed and it should be seen as an audit. As an election slogan, 
accountability was offered as a panacea to all our ills. And by the same 
token, corruption the cause of them. This was too simplistic. It did not 
and does not take into account such factors as mis-management or wrong 
policies, errors of judgment, misreading of the reality on the ground. 
Corruption has been a contributory factor but is not the sole reason why 
things have gone wrong.  Now is the time for balance. For restoring the 
morale of the people and if at all possible for healing wounds. We live in 
an extremely dangerous political neighbourhood. No one should under-
estimate the volatility of the region. Pakistan needs peace both at home 
and in its neighbourhood. Equally, we should try and reduce the temperature 
both at home and abroad. And get on with putting the economy back on the 
rails and start to make plans that will improve the quality of life of the 
majority of our people.

Mazdak

AS a rule, I never respond to comment or criticism published in the letters 
to the editor. I feel that I have enough opportunity to air my views in 
these columns, so if readers want to have a go at me once in a while, that 
is their prerogative.
    
But a few weeks ago, Ms Naasia Azhars letter accusing me of inconsistency 
in my political views made me re-think my position. Basically, in an 
earlier column (Waiting for miracles; April 5, 1997) I had confessed to 
recanting my loyalty to the PPP and the Bhuttos, and Ms Azhar had taken me 
to task, suggesting that I would have been spared the anguish of looking 
back over all these wasted years if I had based my politics on principles 
rather than personalities. Shes right, of course, but without wishing to 
justify or rationalise my position, let me say that I do not feel I have 
been inconsistent: I am still where I was, while the PPP and its leadership 
have undergone a sea change, taking the party far from its moorings.
    
I still believe in social justice and everything this implies. I think the 
state has a moral responsibility towards its citizens, especially the 
weaker sections of society. And while I accept that Bhuttos 
nationalization was an unmitigated disaster, I do not think the state can 
privatize everything in sight, and walk away from its primary duty of 
providing a certain minimum level of education and health care. Although I 
respect the efficiency of the private sector, I do not think it has either 
the inclination or the obligation of filling the vacuum created by the 
states abdication of its duties and responsibilities. In brief, I want to 
see the emergence of a system where the profit motive is tempered by a 
social conscience.
    
There was a fleeting moment in our turbulent political history when, all 
too briefly, there was a glimmer of hope that a party and a government 
would transform these utopian ideas into reality. Or at least thats how it 
seemed in the late sixties to an idealistic young man of vaguely 
socialistic inclinations. And when the dream started growing sour very soon 
after the PPP was voted into power, I and a lot of liberals made up all 
sorts of excuses to justify Bhuttos fascistic tendencies. Basically, we 
had nowhere to go, and we stuck it out, hoping for a miracle.
    
Alas, what we got was a nightmare instead: Zias decade-long assault on 
human rights and personal liberties persuaded many who had earlier jumped 
off the PPP bandwagon to reconsider their position as this was the only 
party that provided any meaningful opposition to the military junta. And 
Bhuttos farcical trial and his tragic end reinforced our support for his 
daughter and his party. Indeed, most democratic, anti-Zia forces coalesced 
behind Benazir Bhutto. Her first stint in power was condoned by many 
because of the difficult situation in which she found herself. However, 
there were no such excuses the second time around.
    
And so to the present: Ms Azhar of Lahore accuses me of going from one 
extreme to the other because I praised Nawaz Sharifs political courage and 
maturity in doing away with Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution. This 
brings me to a train of thought I have been mulling over for the last few 
days: when does a change of heart (or head) become opportunism? Or to put 
it more succinctly, when does a convert become a lota? In my book, the line 
is crossed as soon as there is an element of profit, career advancement or 
political advantage involved in the conversion.
    
There can be many reasons for changing ones political allegiance. For 
instance, a loss of belief in an ideology can switch one off a movement or 
a party. Many people I know have lost their faith in socialism as a result 
of changes in the erstwhile Communist bloc.
   
There are probably more cases of political activists becoming disillusioned 
with the antics of their leaders, and the recent election results reflect 
this tendency as hundreds of thousands of PPP supporters stayed away on 
election day. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to support a political 
party consistently, given the inconsistency of the leadership.
   
And I think this is entirely desirable as it should, in theory, keep 
leaders on their toes. I dont think it is a good idea for our politicians 
to take their supporters for granted, although most of them do, none more 
arrogantly than Benazir Bhutto.
    
Although Ms Azhar is quite right in suggesting that I should learn to 
support principles rather than personalities and parties, the fact is 
that, ultimately, politics is about choices, and in the real world, we 
often choose the lesser of the evils before us. Many people I know did not 
vote last February because they found all the parties and candidates 
equally odious.
    
Fortunately, millions went out to vote despite the lack of options and for 
good or ill, a stable government has been elected to office. Had we all sat 
back and waited for the perfect politician and party to emerge, we might 
have to wait a very long time indeed. Many friends refuse to buy this 
lesser of the evils argument and, like Ms Azhar, insist on principles. 
Well, good luck to them. At the risk of sounding cynical, I would like to 
remind them that there is very little room for principles in politics. 
Indeed, the profession is not noted for its adherence to any principle, 
unless the attainment of power can be counted as one. The reality lies in 
grubby, ambitious men and women intent on grabbing power for their own 
ends.
    
Why then should good, decent people get involved in politics at all? 
Because it affects our lives at every level, and we cant afford to opt 
out; and if we do, we forfeit the right to complain about poor governance 
if we have chosen to sit at home on election day.
    
Just as war is too important to leave to the generals, politics is too 
important to leave to the politicians.</pre><hr><pre>

<a name="bano">Ban on Sohail loss to countrys cricket</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Lateef Jafri

A second cricket ban of two years on national opening batsman, Aamir 
Sohail, when an earlier penalisation of one month had just lapsed, has been 
termed as too harsh by the games observers. They think that the country 
and its cricket will be the losers when there is a dearth of organised and 
experienced openers and Saeed Anwars fitness is a question mark.
    
Will Rameez Raja in his decline and at the age 35 be tested again and 
again? Or will Salim Elahi go through the mill even though he lacks the 
big-match temperament, ask the enthusiasts of the game?
    
This appears to be a crisis period for the national squad. The injury to 
the fearful pacer, Waqar Younis, was a hard blow to the side just on the 
eve of the first Test in Sri Lanka, when captain Wasim Akram had a suspect 
shoulder. No doubt Mohammad Zahid and Shahid Nazir are fine prospects and 
have the energy to go on and on, even on unresponsive strips, they do not 
belong to the class of Wasim and Waqar; neither they are as hardened 
campaigners as the two renowned Ws. Many are worried that the all-rounder 
Shahid Afridi, a courageous slogger and a clever spinner, may be shunted 
out of team for good. He did not get the selectors nod for the Lankan 
trip.
    
Apparently the first action against Aamir Sohail, whatever may be the 
explanation of the boards disciplinary panel, was taken on flimsy grounds. 
If at all the family members of a noted Test and one-day international 
player are harsly treated in the pavilion of the Qadhafi Stadium he will 
feel insulted; he will react emotionally. The disciplinary committee of the 
PCB instead of understanding the sensitive nature of the incident slapped a 
ban on Sohail of one month, a short one but still it disallowed him to take 
part in any cricketing activity.
    
As soon as the first ban had run its course the same two members  the 
third member of the committee abstained from the deliberations of the panel 
though he reportedly concurred with the nature of the penalisation  asked 
the cricketer to appear before them for questioning. The charge: violating 
the code of conduct for publicly levelling some allegations which degraded 
the team and tarnished the image of the country. The allegations of betting 
and match fixing are not new; they are finding space in the print media for 
the last few years. Certainly the foreign critics are whipping up a 
campaign against Pakistan cricket and creating doubts over its strength and 
credibility.
    
Even Javed Burki during his tenure as chairman of the ad hoc committee, 
after having seen the documents at the ICC headquarters at Lords, had 
acknowledged its seriousness and had promised to take severe action against 
the cricketers in this nefarious game, which reportedly had its beginning 
in the home series against Australin (1994-95). The rumours of match-fixing 
were even rife during Pakistans February 1995 tour of Zimbabwe. Burki did 
not initiate any steps for investigation and action but recently made a 
complete U-turn by denying that he had expressed any such opinion. The 
disciplinary committee, while making known its verdict, insisted that the 
Test all-rounder should have provided proof of his charges. The board, the 
committee felt, cannot take action just on complaints; they had to be 
substantiated with proof.
    
Aamir Sohail, while sticking to his stand, was of the view that he had 
submitted the needed documentary evidence to the Ministry of Sports, to 
which the disciplinians had their reservations. Besides they were not asked 
by the Ministry to stop the process of probe.
    
The opening batsman, having served the country to the best of his ability, 
termed the board panels decision an act of victimisation. He will be out 
of action upto April 1999, the cut-off date for selection to the next World 
Cup squad. Being caught in the whirlpool of bias, will he be considered for 
the national side?
    
Many veteran cricketers, organisers and analysts feel that making public 
statements and maligning the team-mates comes under the mischief of code of 
conduct. The charges should have been detailed in a proper manner, if at 
all the board was to take up the issue for a thorough probe and inquiry. 
However, they are of the view that though betting and gambling had their 
origin from the days that cricket started as a recreative pursuit in the 
village green of England, it has become an international phenomenon 
nowadays. The cartels are active in major Indian cities, Sharjah, England, 
Australia and the Caribbean islands. However, throwing of the ties and 
match-fixing as addenda to the international gambling and betting are new 
evils which cannot but be condemned.
    
The Australians Tim May, Shane Warne and Mark Waugh had complained against 
the offer of bribe by Salim Malik, then captaining Pakistan in the matches 
on the Australian tour of this country (1994-95 season) but Mr Justice 
Fakhruddin G. Ebrahim, a former Supreme Court Judge, forming a one-man 
inquiry committee, wanted the Australians to give evidence before him. The 
complainants refused to turn up and the whole case crumbled.
    
The disease was infectious. The corruption later spread to Zimbabwe while 
the Pakistanis were on tour there under the leadership of Salim Malik. Even 
though the Zimbabweans recorded their first surprise victory in a Test 
against Pakistan (February 1995) and voices were raised against match-
fixing and a case of a repetition of bribery no notice was taken by the 
Pakistani board. As recent as this month the bookies were active in Sharjah 
and there were doubts that results in the round-robin stage of the 
triangular, if not in the final, were fabricated.
    
If the Pakistan Cricket Board is not going to launch a full-scale inquest 
under neutral personages viz retired members of the higher judiciary, will 
the Government of Pakistan step in to start an inquiry of their own into 
this malaise and try to scotch this element from the body of Pakistan 
cricket.
    
The severe action against Aamir Sohail, right or wrong, should goad the 
Government into action and it should do what the board has failed to do to 
save Pakistans cricket from further infamy.
    
It is not known if Sohail will make an appeal to the Chief Executive of the 
PCB. Though the disciplinary committee considers itself to be autonomous 
the Test cricketer may yet move a prayer to the higher tiers of the board, 
the Executive Council and the General Body, which may go into the matter in 
an objective way.
    
Former Test captains, cricketers and others have been saddened by the ban 
on Aamir Sohail. Hanif Mohammad, known throughout the world for his cricket 
exploits, considers the action as too severe. A fine may have been 
sufficient.
    
Intikhab Alam, former captain and manager, said Sohail was a little bit 
hot-tempered but that was a challenge for the management to handle. On the 
whole Intikhab found him to be a team-man, a fighter to the core, a quality 
player, the career of whom scintillates as an opening batsman and a shrewd 
spinner.
    
Some have pointed to the misdemeanours of Brian Lara, Dennis Lillee and Ian 
Botham. Lara still is playing the role of an Eminent Grise for the West 
Indies while Botham and Lillee gave their full value to the English and 
Australian teams.
    
One expects the PCB panel to have a second look at its action and give a 
chance to Aamir Sohail, a daring and valiant batsman, to serve the national 
squad as well as he had continued to do.

<a name="govt">Govt trying to resolve Aamir Sohail issue</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, April 24: Efforts are underway at the governmentlevel to 
amicably resolve the dispute involving Pakistans star opener Aamir Suhail 
and the Pakistan Cricket Board, a senior government official informed Dawn 
on Thursday.

The PCB chairman is scheduled to meet the Minister for Sports Mushahid 
Hussain on May 4.
    
A severe two-year ban was slapped on the stylish cricketer by the 
disciplinary committee of the PCB, headed by Talat Ali, for implicating 
fellow team-mates in bribery and match-fixing.
    
The batsman had met Mushahid Hussain before appearing in front of the 
disciplinary committee. The opener had also given the Minister a file which 
carried all the details about the issue which he wanted to convey to the 
government, it was learnt.
    
Talking to this correspondent on Thursday evening the Minister for Sports 
confirmed that such a file was given to him by Aamir Suhail. We are trying 
to amicably resolve the issue, the Minister said.
    
When asked that the PCB constitution may not allow the interference of the 
government at any level, the Minister stated that no one was interfering 
with the constitution of the board. 
   
It has become a national issue where the integrity of the  country was 
being questioned; it is being debated by every well- wisher of cricket, 
Mushahid Hussain said.
    
It may be added here that a separate report on the issue has been prepared 
by the Ministry of Sports which carries different aspects of the 
controversy. It also gives the background of the 1994 disclosures by other 
players. 
    
However, the Ministry in its report has also sided with the disciplinary 
committees action that since being the competent authority the batsman 
should have taken it into confidence. It is further added that the batsman 
may not have addressed the proper forum for remedy before blowing up the 
news to the Press. The report also mentions that after 1994, the batsman 
continued to be part of the same team and only came out with his story 
after a controversy with the PCB.

<a name="desi">De Silva hits up fine century as first Test is drawn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

COLOMBO (Sri Lanka), April 23: Aravinda de Silva knocked up a magnificent 
168 as the first Test between Pakistan and Sri Lanka ended in a tame draw 
at the Premadasa Stadium here on Wednesday.
    
Despite being forced to keep chasing the ball throughout the day, Pakistan 
were not disappointed in the end when their off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq 
captured four wickets for 137 runs after his five wickets for 89 runs in 
the first. Saqlain finished with the outstanding analysis of 107.4-20-226-9 
in the match.
    
Saqlain was well rewarded for his laborious effort when he was adjudged 
Man-of-the-Match.
    
Helped by two more half centuries on the final day from Hashan Tillekeratne 
(54) and Sanath Jayasuriya (62), the world champions were 423 for eight 
when both the captains decided to call off the proceedings with the 
departure of Chaminda Vaas who gave Mushtaq Ahmad his third wicket of the 
innings and sixth of the match.
    
Pakistan had earlier taken a slender 48-run first innings lead by scoring 
378 in reply to the hosts 330. At close, Sri Lanka were 375 runs in front.
    
Aravinda de Silva, who resumed this morning at 79, took another 42 balls to 
get the required 21 runs to complete his ninth century in Test and fifth 
against Pakistan.
    
The century also helped him break his century drought. His last century was 
against Pakistan at Faisalabad in the 1995-96 series.
    
Aravinda de Silva, 31 and playing his 59th Test, eclipsed two personal 
landmarks also. His 168 was his best score at home. He broke his previous 
best of 148 against India on the 1993-94 rubber. Aravindas 168 was also 
his best score against Pakistan with the previous being 127 here on the 
1994-95 series.
    
De Silva was not only a model of concentration, application and 
determination, he played some hard pulls and cuts to do bulk of the scoring 
in those areas. Unfortunately, Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja didnt plug that 
area.
    
De Silva, after reaching the three figures, was seen at his brilliant best 
when he played sparkling shots. Mohammad Zahid was one of the sufferers 
from de Silvas onslaught when he was struck for three boundaries in a row 
off the third over with the second new ball.
    
But Aravinda de Silvas dismissal was mainly due to a casual shot. Trying 
to drive Mushtaq Ahmad over extra-cover, he failed to connect the ball well 
and Saqlain Mushtaq pulled off a blinder at the same area.
    
The former Sri Lankan skipper, in all, batted for eight hours and 28 
minutes during which he received 383 balls. His innings sparkled with 14 
boundaries and a six.
    
Aravinda de Silva reached his century from 235 balls with seven fours and a 
six while his 150 came off 333 balls and included 13 boundaries and a six.

<a name="jans">Jansher Khan plans to promote squash in Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Farhana Ayaz

ISLAMABAD, April 25: Jansher Khan, the ace squash star, would be provided 
all assistance by the government for the plans to promote the game in the 
country. This assurance was given to the squash stalwart by the Minister 
for Sports, Mushahid Hussain, who hosted a reception here at a local hotel 
in the honour of the worldbeater on claiming the British Open title for the 
sixth consecutive time.
    
The Minister hoped that the ace player would continue to excel and multiply 
his achievements. He is a living asset for Pakistan, Mushahid said. 
However Mr Mushahid declined to announce any awards. A shield was presented 
to Jansher by the Minister at a simple ceremony.
    
The Minister also assured the star that the government would provide the 
agreed amount of Rs 4.0 million for the organisation of the Pakistan Open 
at Islamabad from Aug 3-8, as part of its share. The rest of the amount Rs 
4.5 million, is to be generated by the Pakistan Squash Federation.
    
I requested the ministers and the Secretary Sports that the required money 
should be provided for the Pakistan Open which is being organised in 
connection with the Pakistan Golden Jubilee celebrations, and they have 
assured me that the funds will be given, Jansher said.
    
The eight-time world champion stated that very soon he would be submitting 
a detailed programme for the promotion of squash to the Minister. It would 
have plans for the talented youngsters by holding workshops and clinics to 
polish their skill etc.
    
Giving account of the training camp exclusively held for the top youngsters 
at Peshawar, Jansher said it was already paying dividends in the form of 
Amjad Khan who will be jumping from 150 in the world to 50 in the next 
ranking. He created a number of upsets at Karachi beating Mir Zaman and 
Zarak Jehan, which was the result of just three months training.
    
However, the champion stated that youngsters have an uphill task ahead of 
them and only continuous and untiring hard work can provide the desired 
results. The training camps exclusively for youngsters were set up at 
Peshawar and Karachi to reduce the existing gap between Jansher and other 
Pakistanis.
    
Amjad, who also a nephew of Jansher, will be able to qualify in the ranking 
tournaments by virtue of top 50 ranking in the world. This was only his 
second US$10,000 tournament, but he has proven his worth; now he requires 
to gain international experience and confidence, Jansher said.
    
About his own plans the 29-year-old stalwart said that he aspires to win 
the World Open title for another four years. I feel okay, confident and 
fit, he said.
    
The opposition, he said, was pretty tough and was getting tougher. 
Youngsters like Jonathan Power (Canada), Peter Nicol (Scotland), Ahmed 
Barada (Egypt) are equally strong physically but lack experience.

In the first week of May Jansher would be flying out to India to sign a 
sponsorship contract. One of the six tournaments which Jansher will compete 
also includes the Mahindra Open which created a lot of controversy last 
year. Jansher pulled out of the event citing security reasons behind the 
decision. He was penalised with zero point and paid pound sterling 1,000 
for the pullout. This year I plan to play in India. Hopefully there will 
be no security concerns, he said, after giving details of the circuit 
which he starts with Al Ahram US$ 150,000 prize money.
    
Before the World Open which is scheduled for October this year at Kuala 
Lumpur, I plan to play some six tournaments, he said.
 
Jansher said that after the Cairo event, he would proceed to London for the 
left foot operation. Jansher also disclosed that he had requested the PSF 
that the dates for the US$ 90,000 Pakistan Open should be revised to the 
first week of September. Because I would be requiring some six weeks for 
the healing and since my operation would be on June 20, therefore its 
better that the event is shifted to September, he said. Jansher broke his 
left foot eight years ago while training at a PAF ground. He was advised 
operation four years ago after he won a final in America. My foot has 
started to trouble me now. During the games sometimes the pain becomes 
quite intense, Jansher said.  Secretary Sports, Dr Akhtar Hassan, Qamar 
Zaman, officials of the Ministry and Pakistan Sports Board were present at 
the reception.

<a name="bids">Bids to scale high peaks in Golden Jubilee year</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Azmat Ansari

WHILE a team of nine Pakistanis is on its way to the Mount Everest, 
preparations for a Pak-China expedition to Nanga Parbat, another 
challenging high peak, are almost complete. Both these ventures are part of 
the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Pakistan.
    
The route taken by the Pakistani climbers is the longest and the most 
hazardous. It runs across the aspect of the peak that faces Tibet.
    
The team comprises Nazir Sabir (Leader), Sher Khan (Deputy Leader), Rajab 
Shah, Mohammad Iqbal, Meharban Shah, Sarwar Khan, Ghulam Hussain, Ibrahim 
Khan, Rozi Ali and Saifullah Khan (doctor).

The team is also carrying with it Pakistans flag and banners of the 
sponsors that it would unfurl on the summit.
    
Meanwhile the expedition to the Everest having stayed for a little while in 
Kathmandu and then in Lhasa is now climbing the peak. It would take 14 
Chinese and three Pakistani climbers to the peak which is known in the 
circle of mountaineers as, perhaps one of the most difficult peaks to scale 
on account of the precipices, sharp rock pinnacles and slopes that are 
almost vertical.
    
Mr. Zeng Shu Sheng, President Chinese Mountaineering association who was in 
Karachi for a brief stopover having just returned from Islamabad where he 
discussed the details of the expedition with the officials said that the 
Chinese team was looking forward to the event with great enthusiasm and 
expectations.
