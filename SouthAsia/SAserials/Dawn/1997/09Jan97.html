<a name="emer">Emergency not on Council agenda</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ansar Abbasi

ISLAMABAD, Jan 7: Minister for Defence, Establishment and Law 
Shahid Hamid has ruled out the possibility of imposition of 
emergency in the country and categorically stated that emergency 
will not be imposed.
    
Talking to Dawn on Monday, the minister said the newly constituted 
Council for Defence and National Security is meeting on Wednesday. 
He said the agenda of the Council, which is being kept secret, does 
not include any proposal relating to imposition of emergency.
    
Elections would be held on February 3, 1997 in a free, fair and 
impartial atmosphere and there is absolutely no possibility of 
emergency whatsoever, the minister reiterated. Likewise I would 
also strongly deny that there is any proposal to delay elections 
for a single day what to talk of months or years, the defence 
minister stated.
    
He said that the caretakers were only there to hold free, fair and 
impartial elections and that they have no political agenda to 
fulfil. He assured that the Council will operate strictly in line 
with its terms of reference. Although he said that the political 
situation is not part of the Councils terms of reference but he 
indicated this could be discussed if it has any relation to the 
national security.
    
To a question, the minister said in the name of national security 
we will not take action on everything under the sun. He, however, 
added the president and the prime minister are authorised to refer 
any matter for discussion.
    
The minister did not disclose the agenda of the meeting but said in 
its preliminary meeting the Council will discuss various issues 
concerning our defence and national security.
    
Referring to the earlier announcement, he said, the Council is an 
advisory body whose job will be to advise the government on issues 
mentioned in its terms of reference.
    
President Sardar Farooq Khan Leghari will chair the council 
meeting. Those who will attend the meeting include Prime Minister 
Malik Meraj Khalid, Minister for Defence Shahid Hamid, Minister for 
Interior Umer Khan Afridi, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff 
Committee, Chief of the Army Staff, Chief of the Naval Staff and 
Chief of the Air Staff.

<a name="lhcs">LHC suspends promotion order of 56 bureaucrats</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report 

ISLAMABAD, Jan 6: The controversy over the recent promotion of 56 
bureaucrats belonging to Secretariat Group in grade 21, took a new 
turn when the Lahore High Court suspended the operation of 
Establishment Divisions notification, dated December 31, 1996, 
regarding these elevations.
    
The notification, had announced the immediate promotion of 56 
officers to BS 21 against 61 sanctioned posts of senior joint 
secretaries.
    
The notification was issued on the same day (Dec. 31) when the 
Lahore High Court issued a stay order to 10 joint secretaries who 
went before the court against the recommendation of the Central 
Selection Board-I which cleared these officers for promotion.
    
The petitioners, through Sheikh Riazul Haq, advocate, filed a 
contempt case against four officers of the Establishment Division 
for issuing the notification in total disregard of the directions 
of the Lahore High Court.
    
According to Sheikh Riazul Haq, Justice Mian Nazir Akhtar of the 
LHC, while hearing the contempt petition, suspended the operation 
of the notification.
   
Meanwhile , the contempt proceedings have also been initiated 
against A. W. Qazi, Additional Secretary; Brig (retd) Saeed Akhtar, 
Joint Secretary; Fazle Qadir, Deputy Secretary ; and Abdul Bari, 
Section Officer, which have been fixed for hearing on January 9 .
    
The petitioners contended that despite the courts order on 
December 31 that the respondent would not issue any notification, 
the notification was issued.
    
The stay order was issued by the court at 0840 hours in the 
presence of the deputy attorney- general. They added that their 
counsel had conveyed the above order to the Establishment Division 
by fax No 9202980 on or about 0930 hours.
    
The court was told that the message was repeated on December 31 by 
the counsel by fax ( No 9210110) to the deputy secretary, 
administration of the Establishment Division, on or about 1500 
hours. 
 
They added that thereafter, the Deputy Secretary, Litigation, Aftab 
Ahmad, contacted the counsel for the petitioners by phone at about 
1600 hours and confirmed the receipt of the two faxed massages 
about the stay order.
    
The petitioners told the court that the ED was fully in the 
knowledge of the stay order but the notification was issued after 
1900 hours on the same day.
    
The contempt petition said that on January 1, the counsel for the 
petitioners, after learning about the notification, sent a message 
by fax to the contemners to immediately withdraw the illegal 
notification but the contemners were quite adamant and were not 
prepared even now to withdraw the notification.
    
Sheikh Riazul Haq prayed before the court that the respondents had 
deliberately disobeyed the orders of the court and, therefore, were 
guilty of contempt of court.
    
It may be mentioned here that almost all the 56 officers, who were, 
promoted on December 31, took charge of their position the very 
next day and informed the ED the following day by fax.
    
Another point under discussion regarding these promotions is: 
whether the notification was issued with the approval of the 
caretaker prime minister.

<a name="haki">Hakim Zardari remanded in FIA custody</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 2: Hakim Ali Zardari, father of Asif, was remanded in 
the custody of the Federal Investigation Agency by judicial 
magistrate, South, Hamza Khan, till Jan 4. 
  
He was arrested by the Commercial Banks Circle of the FIA on 
Wednesday night from his Clifton residence on the warrant issued by 
the Chief Ehtesab Commission. 
   
Sources said an assistant director of the FIA CBC was interrogating 
Mr Zardari who were facing corruption charges in a land scam. They 
said Mr Zardari could be flown to Islamabad in two or so days for 
investigation into charges against him.
    
The sources said the case against the father of Asif Zardari 
pertained to the allotment of a plot he had acquired in Rawalpindi 
for constructing a hotel.

<a name="asif">Asif remanded in judicial custody</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 2: The judicial magistrate, South, remanded Asif Ali 
Zardari, ex-MNA, in judicial custody till Jan 4, and referred his 
case to the trial court of district and sessions judge, South, for 
regular hearing.
    
Mr Zardari was produced in the court amid tight security by the 
rangers and the police. A suspected threat to life was given to Mr 
Zardari, explained a rangers officer who had closed the entrance 
to the courts for all visitors.
    
Briefing newsmen, Farooq Naek, counsel for Mr Zardari, said the 
investigating officer in the Murtaza murder case, SSP-CIA Ali Gohar 
Mithiani, had submitted inconclusive challans and sought some time 
for collection of evidence.
    
Barkat Chaudhry, the prosecuting inspector, told Dawn that the 
supplementary challans naming Mr Zardari had been filed in the 
court, and added that Shakaib Qureshi, the then SP of South, had 
also been named and declared an absconder.
    
Mr Qureshi was not named in any of the three FIRs lodged by Clifton 
SHO, the late Haq Nawaz Sial, Asghar Ali and Noor Mohammad, two 
personal servants of Mir Murtaza Bhutto.
    
In view of the incomplete findings against 20 accused, Mr Mithiani 
submitted a list of 52 witnesses, including the doctors of the JPMC 
and Mideast, Ghinwa Bhutto, Fatima Bhutto, daughter of Mir Murtaza, 
police officers, and PPP (SB) workers.
    
Mr Mithiani, who held the dual charge of the DIG Crimes Branch, 
alleged in his findings that the high-ranking police officials, 
involved in the case, had deliberately destroyed the evidence. He 
said it would take some time to collect ample evidence against 
those influential officials. 
    
Mr Naek, who held a diametrical opposite view, told Dawn that he 
and his client, Mr Zardari, were hopeful of the outcome of the 
case. The police and the other interrogators had failed to prove 
that Mir Murtazas murder was a result of conspiracy in which his 
client was involved, he added.
    
However, Mr Chaudhry said the investigating officer had adequate 
material against the people involved in the case.

<a name="trib">Tribunal warns doctor of perjury case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied

KARACHI, Jan 2: Dr S. M. A. Shah, a member of the medical board 
which had examined the injuries to ASP Shahid Hayat, informed the 
tribunal of inquiry that the authorities wanted to make meaningful 
changes in the report but he refused to sign a second report.
    
I thwarted the move by refusing to sign a second report after a 
couple of days, Dr. Shah, told the tribunal.
    
He was one of the members of the 10-member medical board, who had 
examined the wounded the ASP. Shahid Hayat had received a bullet 
wound in his left thigh.
    
The board in its finding had stated that it was a case of firearm 
injury and that it was not a self-inflicted one. The distance of 
firing on his left thigh was between 2 and 3 feet.
    
He said he was the author of the report and all the nine other 
members unanimously agreed and signed the report. But a few days 
later, he was contacted by the chairman of the board, Dr A. Karim 
Siddiqui, to sign another report which was a typed one with 
meaningful changes in it.
    
The witness said he refused to sign although all the other members 
had done so, including the chairman, because its sanctity was 
destroyed, and was being done at the behest of those who had 
constituted the board.
    
An attempt was made to change the report, he informed the tribunal.
    
Q: Who had brought the typed report for your signatures?
    
A: Dr Karim Siddiqui, professor and head of the department of 
surgery, DMC and Dr Tariq Mirza, vice principal of DMC and 
associate professor of forensic medicine, had come to my residence 
to get the signatures.
    
Q: What did they tell you and why they wanted your signatures on a 
new report?
    
A: They said the report which I had written in my handwriting was 
typed and they sought my signatures saying that minor alterations 
have been made. It had already been signed by eight doctors and Dr 
Ishaque Shaikh had not signed it because he was not available at 
his place. They said he will sign it later.
    
Q: What reasons the two doctors gave for typing out the documents 
and getting the signatures of all the 10, a repetition of exercise?
    
A: The reason the two doctors gave was that in a court a typed 
report is submitted and my view was that it should not have been 
signed before it was typed. Again! my point of view was once 
written and signed, it should not be revised.
    
Tribunal asks Tariq Mirza: On a question from Karim Khan Agha 
whether you were pressured after you signed the report about Shahid 
Hayat, you had denied it. About the changing of a report, do you 
maintain and reiterate what you had stated earlier?
    
Tariq Mirza: I stand by whatever I had stated earlier.
    
The witness was asked to produce the typed version with nine 
signatures, minus the signature of Dr Shah. This will be produced 
on Sunday morning, because he had torn the signature part of the 
document.
    
Question from the assistant AG, Latif Abdul Ansari: Did the health 
secretary know the contents of both the typed and hand-written 
reports and you and Dr Karim Siddiqui were playing to the tunes of 
the health secretary who was invisible hand behind the scene to 
destroy the sanctity of the report?
    
A: No.
    
Earlier, the tribunal examined Sarfaraz Ahmed, staff reporter of 
Dawn, who had reported on Sept 27 that according to a member of 
the board, who sought anonymity, the examination of the policemans 
belongings, such as his shoe and socks proved that if one goes by 
the injureds account, the direction of the bullet indicated that 
he was fired upon from a helicopter because the bullet had hit him 
in the inner side of his heel skin which did not hurt bone, and the 
bullet seemed to be of a revolver, and the firearms seized from Mir 
Murtaza Bhuttos men did not include such arms.
    
He was asked by the tribunal to state who the member of the board 
was, to which, he said, it has already been reported he was 
speaking on anonymity.
    
The reporter was asked whether the member volunteered to give the 
information or did he ask him to know the facts to which he replied 
that he had contacted him and that he knew him before.
    
Q: Did you contact any other member of the board?
    
A: Yes. But he declined to talk.
    
Q: Can you identify the person who spoke to you?
    
A: Our professional ethics do not permit us to divulge the source, 
otherwise our sources of information would be dried up. Nobody in 
future would talk to us.
    
The tribunal gave him another chance to think over it and reappear 
again and state what he wanted to say.
   
The witness said that he will contact his editor and make a 
statement accordingly.

<a name="dmcp">DMC professor admits he made a wrong statement</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied 

KARACHI, Jan 5: A fourth medical board was also constituted by the 
government of Sindh after the Sept 20 killings to determine whether 
Mideast Medical Centre, where Mir Murtaza Bhutto was admitted after 
the police firing, had proper medical facilities or not.
    
This was disclosed by Prof Abdul Karim Siddiqui, professor and head 
of the department of surgery, Dow Medical College, Karachi, before 
a three-member judicial tribunal which is investigating the causes 
of death of Mir Murtaza. The tribunal comprises Justice Nasir Aslam 
Zahid, judge of the Supreme Court; justice Amanullah Abbasi, and 
Justice (Dr) Ghous Mohammad, judges of the High Court of Sindh.
    
He did not elaborate further and the tribunal asked him to produce 
documents relating to the composition of the board and its findings 
by Monday morning.
    
Justice N. A. Zahid observed that it has been revealed for the 
first time that such a medical board was constituted by the 
government and it had submitted its report.
    
Dr Siddiqui said this was the fourth medical board constituted 
after the Sept 20 killings, the first was created to examine the 
left foot bullet wound of Haq Nawaz Sial, SHO of Clifton police 
station; the second for examining the post-mortem report on his 
body after his death six days later; and the third was in 
connection with the bullet injuries to the left thigh of ASP Shahid 
Hayat.
    
The 58-year-old surgeon was asked if there was any single incident 
during his entire career that a medical boards finding once made 
and initialled by all the members, was attempted to be revised.
    
He said he could not recollect any such incident in the past and 
the witness was being questioned by the tribunal as to why it took 
seven days to type a report which was finalised and signed by all 
members of the board.
    
The tribunal told him that was it not a fact that the delay was 
caused in submitting the report to the government not because of 
typing but due to altering its contents in connection with the 
injuries of ASP Shahid Hayat.
    
The witness was warned several times that he was under oath and 
should testify as a truthful witness and his evidence should be 
very transparent although he had made everything black.
    
The tribunal observed that the story about altering the medical 
report by making five changes on facts and two changes on opinion, 
was first made by Dr Shuja Hasan Khan of AKUH and later confirmed 
by Dr S. M. A. Shah of AO Clinic, that the medical boards findings 
were altered, once it was signed and full seven days were taken for 
forcing Dr Shah to sign it but he had refused to do so.
    
He was reminded by the tribunal that a letter was issued on Sept 29 
for the composition of a medical board and on Sept 30 the members 
were assembled and they drafted a report which was formally signed. 
But its submission to the government was delayed because the 
chairman of the board had been unable to find Dr Shah, the only 
non-government doctor, as he had not been cooperating with them for 
making changes. Dr Shah in his earlier examination had described 
the changes as meaningful.
    
The tribunal observed that if these doctors in very senior 
positions have been found to be handling the medical reports in 
such a casual way, that is, they are prepared to alter it to suit 
the needs of their bosses in important cases like these. The 
tribunal wondered as to what might be happening with people who are 
less fortunate.
    
Q: Was any pressure put on you to change the contents of the report 
or dilute it?
    
A: This is not correct. The original report was unanimous and 
prepared after discussion. It was written by Dr S. M. A. Shah, and 
every member of the board signed it. I was the chairman of the 
board. I was to submit the report.
    
Q: You were to only examine the officers wounds and not to give 
any report because there was no such condition laid?
    
A: Yes. We four or five discussed the report after others had left.
    
Q: From the house of Dr Shah, how many time you contacted the 
health secretary over phone?
    
A: Only one call was made and I also gave the phone to Dr Shah to 
talk to the health secretary.
    
Q: In Dr Mirzas evidence it has come on record that more than 2-3 
calls were made and one call was received from the health 
secretary.
    
A: Todays statement of mine is correct. I told the health 
secretary over phone that there would be some delay in submitting 
the report because Dr Shah had suggested to examine the doctor at 
AKUH for a first-hand account from him. Then we two returned from 
his house.
    
Then we assembled at AKUH on Oct. 7, except for one doctor all were 
present and Dr Shahzad, of AKUH, was not available to us because he 
was busy. Then I showed both reports to Dr Mushtaq Ahmed, to which 
he said there cant be two reports. We agreed to submit the 
original hand-written report.
    
Q: The hand-written report of Sept 30 was kept secret until Oct. 7. 
If the original hand-written report contained mistakes why did 
you allow the same after seven days to be sent to the health 
secretary, which meant that you are ready to submit any report and 
amend any report as long as it suits you.
    
A: The original report was more than what was asked from us, but it 
was not an incorrect one.
    
At this stage, the tribunal called for a copy of Dawn of Oct. 1 
which carried a full report on the findings of the medical board, 
although the members had reserved their order. The contents were 
read out by the chairman and he asked the witness if he had read 
the account, to which he said no.
    
Q: What have you been telling the health secretary for seven days 
about the report, telling him each time that it has not yet been 
typed. Did you also tell him that you were trying to amend the 
report and what was his reaction?
    
A: He kept reminding us about the urgency.
    
Q: Your report not only opines that the injury was of firearm, it 
was from a close range, did you at any time thereafter consider 
that the report was not in compliance with the order?
    
A: Both the reports were identical, but the only thing was we had 
gone beyond the task assigned to us by the government.
    
The tribunal made serious reservations to the continued absence of 
Nehal Hashmi, counsel for 11 policemen, including an ASI, a head 
constable and nine constables.
    
The chairman of the tribunal observed that he was worried about the 
policemen who are being neglected by their counsel, who doesnt 
appear to defend them and he was making a mockery of human rights. 
The counsel was asked not to talk of human rights before us. Once 
a while you drop in for a moment and then disappear for several 
days, saying you are busy elsewhere.
    
Other witnesses who were examined by the tribunal were Dr Mohammad 
Umar Baloch, who has just retired as civil surgeon; Dr Tariq Mirza 
and Dr M. Shafi Quraishy, principal of DMC and professor of 
medicine.

<a name="poli">Police surgeons role criticised by tribunal</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied 

KARACHI, Jan 6: Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, chairman of the three-
member tribunal investigating into the causes of death of Mir 
Murtaza Bhutto in the police firing on Sept 20 last, told the 
police surgeon of Karachi, Dr Nizamuddin Memon, that we are 
finding one quality in you to see that you justify holding the 
position of police surgeon. We have not found one so far.
    
The chairman observed that the police surgeon, a prized post held 
by him, has been making vague statements before the tribunal such 
as I dont know, It didnt strike me, I cant recollect now, 
If I had made some observation that would have annoyed some other 
doctors, etc.
    
The police surgeon was told by the tribunal, two other members of 
which are Justice Amanullah Abbasi and Justice (Dr) Ghous Mohammad, 
judges of the High Court of Sindh, that he was slow in action, slow 
to recollect, slow to act and a man in his position should be an 
example for being very upright and who always values principles and 
that no body should point fingers at him.
    
It was further pointed out to him that character, integrity, 
discipline, courage and other similar qualities one could not find 
in him.
    
On a question from the tribunal whether there was a fourth medical 
board to find out if Mideast Medical Centre had the facilities to 
treat people where Mir Murtaza Bhutto was taken after he was 
injured on Sept 20 last?
    
A: I am not aware of any such inquiries from the government as I 
heard about it only a day before, when Dr Abdul Karim Siddiqui, 
professor and head of the department of surgery of DMC, was 
searching for the papers about the medical board. I was not a 
member of that board either.
    
Q: There was a time lag between the examination of ASP Shahid Hayat 
and submitting the report to the health secretary, and during this 
period you attempted to dilute the report?
    
A: I never made any such attempt to dilute the report of the 
injuries suffered by the ASP.
    
Q: In your earlier statement before the tribunal, you had denied by 
saying it was absolutely incorrect, that he ever made such 
attempts.
    
The tribunal played back the tapes and then asked him do you still 
maintain that your answer (statement) made earlier was correct?
    
A: My earlier answer was not correct, and now I want to add some 
thing by way of explanation. Our job is technical and we needed 
time to write reports after the meeting. The report prepared by Dr 
S. M. A. Shah was a rough copy and a fair one will be prepared 
later and that was the idea I had formed after I and other members 
of the board had signed it. The government had only asked us to 
examine the injuries of ASP Shahid Hayat.
    
The witness gave five reasons why he thought the report should be 
modified:
    
 The government had only asked the board to examine the injury;
    
 He had not seen the excised wound;
    
 The fact that it had taken the ASP two hours to reach the 
hospital after the incident, what was he doing by then;
    
 The ASP provided civilian trousers which had already been washed 
for examination; and
    
 It was strange that a person in civilian dress should be fired at 
rather than policemen who were apparently all around.
    
Q: When did these deficiencies occur to you?
    
A: Some of the points occurred to me before the writing of the 
report. I didnt raise these objections at the time of signing of 
the report, because I didnt like to annoy doctors from AKUH who 
were already angry. Secondly, I thought there was time to finalise 
the report and the way the report had been prepared and signed was 
to my opinion a rough draft.
    
Q: From your answers does it follow that all the members had 
considered the report a rough draft and not a final report?
    
A: I dont know about others, because it was not discussed openly.
    
Q: Did anybody else give the same impression that the report was 
not a final one?
    
A: Usually, the members sign on a typed report and it was only a 
hand-written report.
    
Q: In your experience were there any hand-written reports sent to 
the government?
    
A: So far only two, in the case of Sial and ASP Shahid Hayat.
    
Q: Was there any urgency about the report in this case?
    
A: There was no urgency at that time.
    
Q: Did no body tell you that the health secretary was asking for 
the report urgently?
    
A: Honestly speaking, I can say that till the writing of the 
report, there was no urgency shown for the report. I thought there 
would be another meeting and the issue would be discussed and the 
report would be prepared, signed and submitted.
    
Q: You still maintain that the hand-written report was incorrect 
and incomplete?
    
A: It was in complete but correct. We had not seen the injury, 
before it was written.
    
Q: Are both reports correct?
    
A: The typed report with eight signatures was more complete.
    
Q: More complete means that it was more curtailed in facts and 
opinion?
    
A: Yes. The second report was based on what was asked for by the 
government.
    
The tribunal observed that it was he who started all this by 
challenging the original report and raising objections. It would 
have been appropriate to submit both the reports to the government. 
He was asked why did he not suggest to the chairman to do so.
 
Q: Apparently you were told by some authorities on the basis of 
which you initiated necessary action for the compliance of their 
directives by changing the report?
    
A: No one gave me any directions to do so.
    
Q: The thrust was to submit a typed report different from the 
original one for which there was a delay of seven days?
    
A: The delay had not been on account of changing the report, but it 
was because the members were not available for a second meeting.
    
Q: How then the members were available when the board was first 
constituted on Sept 29 and on the next date the report was ready 
and signed by all 10 members. How only five or six members decided 
to alter the report. Was there pressure on you which you could not 
sustain and major improvements have been made?
    
A: Material improvements were made.
    
Q: Doubts have been cast when two reports were prepared of one 
medical board and the sanctity of the first report was destroyed?
    
A: The sanctity of the earlier report was affected.
    
Q: Did at any time in the past a medical board report was changed?
    
A: No. Because reports are not prepared immediately after 
examination and sometimes a month is taken to prepare a report. We 
have never examined a case where a person was treated and examined 
at two different hospitals.
    
Tribunal: There is no difference between a signature or thumb 
impression. You should have said that the report would only be 
submitted after examining the injured.
    
Witness: No serious efforts were made to convene another meeting to 
change the report. All the members could not assemble at AKUH.
    
Tribunal: With a person like you, no improvement can be seen. 
Everyone of you who came here has lied before us, we have doubts 
about your integrity, the integrity of Dr Karim Siddiqui and Dr 
Tariq Mirza, all of you have not told the whole truth.
 
Q: Did you talk about the weapons used in firing at Sials foot at 
the meeting of the board?
    
A: Different firearms were discussed. The use of revolver was also 
discussed having been used for firing at the left foot of Sial. The 
use of helicopter was not at all discussed and before the release 
of the official report I have not talked about the deliberations to 
the Press.
 
Q: Did you inform the Press that the bullet was fired from a 
revolver?
    
A: I dont remember, but I might not have spoken to the Press. I 
have not stated to the Press that Mir Murtazas men did not carry 
any revolver or that the firing was from a helicopter. I have also 
not said that it was fired from a revolver. To my mind, it was a 
2.8 pistol which had been used. I didnt know what arms were 
recovered from Murtazas men.
    
On a question from Manzoor Bhutta, counsel: Did Sial tell you when 
he appeared before the board for examination of his foot that he 
was involved by some important people who have now abandoned him. 
Now, I want to disclose their names?
    
A: No.
    
Earlier, Sarfaraz Ahmad, a reporter of daily Dawn, appeared as a 
witness, on an application filed by counsel Karim Khan Agha, asking 
him to name the member of the medical board who had given him 
information about the type of injury which inspector Sial had 
suffered.
 
The reporter submitted a statement that he may kindly be excused 
from answering questions requiring him to disclose the identity of 
the person from whom he received the information forming the basis 
of the report which appeared in Dawn of Sept 27.
    
He gave the following reasons:
    
1. The duty to protect the confidentiality of his source of 
information is an integral part of journalists ethics observed and 
respected all over the world. Our profession requires us to protect 
the anonymity of source;
    
2. In the process of news gathering a reporter collects information 
from various sources and owes an obligation in relation to those 
who do not wish to be identified. In the absence of an undertaking 
to respect such confidentiality it may become impossible to perform 
the public duty owned by the Press; and
    
3. That the freedom of the Press guaranteed by the Constitution 
might become illusory unless protection against disclosure is 
afforded to journalists in the same manner as it is afforded to 
lawyers, doctors and public servants. I am informed that such 
privilege of journalists is lately being recognised in many legal 
systems on grounds of public policy.
    
The tribunal did not accept the plea advanced by him and afforded 
one more opportunity to him on Tuesday to state any law in Pakistan 
which provides privileges which he is claiming, not to divulge his 
source of information.

<a name="repo">Report was prepared as the authorities wanted it</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied 

KARACHI, Jan 7: Testifying before the judicial tribunal, 
investigating the causes of murder of Mir Murtaza Bhutto, on 
Tuesday a retired radiologist said the second report of the medical 
board on the injuries suffered by ASP Shahid Hayat was modified as 
the authorities wanted.
    
The witness who made this statement was Dr Matin Ahmed Khan, a 
former professor of radiology and head of the department of 
radiology of Dow Medical College, Karachi, who was one of the 
members of the medical board along with five other doctors.
    
Dr Khan retired in the middle of last year, was re-appointed on 
contract in the same position and was removed from service on Nov. 
11 by the present caretaker government. He told the tribunal, 
comprising Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, a judge of the Supreme Court; 
Justice Amanullah Abbasi, and Justice (Dr) Ghous Mohammad, judges 
of the High Court of Sindh, that he also served on the two other 
medical boards set up by the government to examine the wound on the 
left foot of inspector Haq Nawaz Sial, his post-mortem six days 
later, and in the case of the injuries on ASP Shahid Hayats left 
leg.
    
Dr Khan was asked by the tribunal if any effort was made to prepare 
any other report other than the original one which was written in 
the handwriting of Dr S. M. A. Shah of A. O. Clinic.
    
He said the report first prepared and signed by all 10 members of 
the board was unanimous.
    
Q: Did you sign the second report which was typed later and altered 
in contents of facts and opinion?
    
A: Yes. I dont remember when I signed the second report, perhaps 
it was after 3-4 days later.
    
Q: Did you compare the two reports?
    
A: I questioned the police surgeon why there are omissions and 
additions in the typed version of the copy.
    
Tribunal: If changes were to be made, then proper methods should 
have been adopted, giving notice to all the members after informing 
the government about it.
    
Q: The second report you signed was a verbatim copy of the first 
report?
    
A: There were changes in the typed report.
    
Q: If there were changes in the report why it was signed by most of 
them?
    
A: Perhaps three of the doctors had not signed it. I also objected 
to the signing of the second report to Dr Karim Siddiqui, police 
surgeon, Dr Nizamuddin Memon, and Dr Tariq Mirza, a forensic 
specialist and vice principal of DMC. They were convinced and said 
the report was altered on the basis of a suggestion that it had 
included information which had not been sought by the health 
department, giving information about the distance from which it was 
fired and saying further that the injury was not a self-suffered 
one.
    
Q: Were you convinced?
    
A: I was convinced that the report be changed in accordance with 
what was asked for or else a wrong report will go to the court.
    
A: Should we be convinced that the report was not concluded 
properly?
    
A: Yes. I am only a radiologist and my subject concerns X-rays etc 
and I was not concerned with the examination of injuries and the 
distance from which it was fired.
    
Q: When did you come to know that the hand-written report is being 
replaced?
    
A: When I was told by Dr Tariq Mirza who said that Dr S. M. A. Shah 
had objected to signing the second altered report. Therefore, a 
meeting has been called at AKUH.
    
Q: What was decided at the meeting?
    
A: The meeting was attended by Dr Karim Siddiqui, Dr Tariq Mirza 
and Dr Nizamuddin Memon and others. Dr Shah and Dr Mushtaq Ahmad 
both suggested that only one report should be submitted to the 
government and it will be the first one, which had all the 10 
signatures, and not the altered one, which was not signed by Dr 
Shah.
    
Q: First, you were convinced that a wrong report should not be 
submitted. Then you changed your mind and said the original report 
be submitted?
    
A: I am a radiologist and a simple member of the board, while 
others had agreed to submit the original report, to which I also 
agreed.
    
Tribunal: You are talking not as a first graduate of LMC. Now you 
are behaving as if you are a fresh graduate. You were made to 
change your opinion.
    
Q: Did you object to making changes in the report once it was 
approved and signed by all the members?
    
A: I agreed when many doctors had agreed to change the report, 
because the ministry (department) concerned had asked for a report 
what they had asked for.
    
Q: Did you inquire of Dr Siddiqui and Dr Mirza when they received 
fresh instructions?
    
A: Both informed that the change was needed. It was told that 
instructions were oral and not in writing. The authorities who gave 
the directive were not identified.
    
Q: You are the senior most in age and experience, why did you not 
suggest that a second report was not called for?
    
A: I may be senior but I was only an ordinary member and with no 
experience of examining the wounds of soft tissues. I did not made 
any suggestion in this regard because I was not an authority.
    
Q: With how many such medical boards you were associated?
    
A: About 100, and except in the present case, never before the 
reports were altered.
    
Q: Who was the member who suggested the report was required 
urgently by the authorities?
    
A: One of the four doctors, Dr Karim Siddiqui, Dr Tariq Mirza, Dr 
Nizamuddin Memon and Dr Umar Baloch.
    
The other two witnesses examined on Tuesday were Abdul Rahim, 
medical record librarian of JPMC; head constable Nazir Ahmed, 
wireless operator of Sindh police telecommunication department in 
the Governors House.
    
Rahim gave details of the procedure followed at the casualty 
department of JPMC and said that inspector Sial came to the 
hospital at 9:10 pm for treatment of his left foot injuries.
    
The next witness, head constable Nazir Ahmed, produced the record 
of message transmitted by the police at a senior level on channel 
No. 6 of radio transmission and all others on channel No. 10.
    
The wireless operator produced the record of messages transmitted 
in which the operators can listen to the voices, but cannot record 
unless asked for further transmissions to various personnel.
    
He said inspector Sial was taken to Liaquat National Hospital 
because at JPMC where he was taken first, and there was a big rush 
at the casualty ward of the hospital.
    
The operator had recorded a message for the DSP and SSP, that he 
was at LNH.
    
At this stage, the tribunal observed that this fact has not come up 
before them and as the matter is being investigated, more and new 
details are coming forward which amounts to something like the 
tribunal is doing the job of the investigating officers.
    
These jobs are supposed to have been done by the investigating 
officers, which we are now doing.
    
The tribunal expressed surprise that this witness was not called 
for recording his statement by the police so far, although the 
challan has been submitted.
    
The investigators are looking into these matters as if it was a 
luxury litigation, in which nobody bothers about the loss of time 
and money.
    
At this stage the chairman directed the assistant advocate- 
general, Ansari Abdul Latif, and a police representative, DSP 
Shamim, to obtain the reports of all the investigating officers so 
far appointed in this case to submit their respective reports 
showing what they had done.
    
These reports are to be submitted on Wednesday afternoon.
    
The tribunal adjourned its hearing until 12-noon on Wednesday.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Jan 4: Caretaker Prime Minister Malik Meraj Khalid has said 
that Pakistan does no longer exists ideologically and warned that 
it was in danger of suffering fragmentation in next 20 years.
    
Referring to a recent UN report which, according to him, stated 
that Pakistan would break into pieces in two decades, the caretaker 
prime minister prayed for a leadership to emerge that should infuse 
among the people a spirit to put Pakistan back on course visualised 
by its founding fathers.
    
He said a recent UN report has led to a horrible future of our 
country fearing that Pakistan would be fragmented in next 20 years 
or so. As for the process of accountability, Mr Meraj Khalid said 
some of the corrupt had been nabbed under electoral laws and many 
more would be arrested.

ISLAMABAD, Jan 5: President Farooq Leghari is looking at various 
organisational options that could ensure the continuity of crucial 
foreign and economic policies during transitional periods and also 
hold back the corrupt governments when they crossed the danger 
point.
    
Talking to a group of newspaper columnists, the president, however, 
clarified that no proposal was under consideration to make a supra 
constitutional or constitutional body for that purpose. He said he 
was thinking in terms of an administrative arrangement positioned 
between the federal cabinet and the defence committee of the 
cabinet (DCC). He insisted that it should not be given the much 
maligned name of National Security Council.
    
He said the matter was still at the idea stage, but did not rule 
out the possibility of the proposed organisation holding its first 
meeting much before the elections. Tentative membership of the 
organisation would have the president, the prime minister, the 
federal ministers of foreign affairs, finance, defence and 
interior, the chairman of joint chiefs of staff committee, and the 
chiefs of staff of they army, navy and air force.
 
The president reiterated his pledge to hold the elections on Feb. 
3, but agreed with a questioner who said the accountability process 
launched soon after the dismissal of the government did not come up 
to the expectations that had been raised by him in the proclamation 
order. But he listed the number of laws the caretaker government 
had promulgated as well as other relevant steps in this regard. 
However, he hastened to provide assurance that despite its apparent 
slow progress the process of accountability, would continue with 
all seriousness of purpose even after the elections. He said 
corruption could not be eliminated overnight from a society: it is 
process and we are trying to strengthen that process.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Rauf Klasra

MULTAN, Jan 7: Prominent politicians of Multan district who are in 
the run for the Feb. 3 elections have submitted, like several 
others, wrong information about their assets and their value to the 
returning officers.

Among them are Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, Speaker of the National 
Assembly, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Sikandar Hayat Bosan, Sheikh 
Muhammad Tahir Rashid, Saeed Ahmad Qureshi, Tanveerul Hasan Gilani, 
Salahuddin Dogar, Haji Boota, Javaid Hashmi and Hamid Saeed Kazmi.

Majority of them seldom paid income tax, wealth tax and land 
revenue in the past. In their statements, they put the value of 
their assets far below the market price. For example, in Multan 
district the market price of one acre of farm land ranges between 
Rs 100,000 to Rs 200,000. But almost in all the submissions the 
candidates have estimated the value of one acre farm land at Rs 
25,000 approximately.

Following are details of the assets of some of the main contestants 
submitted to the ROs;

<a name="part">Parties claims cannot be assuaged: report</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Jan 7: There is no plausible solution to the Kashmir 
problem and the claims of Pakistan, India and the Kashmiris cannot 
be reconciled, a high powered Task Force says it its report on a 
new US Policy towards India and Pakistan.
    
The issue is so politicised and emotional that it is hard even to 
discuss an approach towards resolution, multilateral or bilateral, 
in public without being accused of tilting towards one side, the 
report says.
    
The report comes amid repeated statements by senior US officials in 
the past few months that South Asia will receive top priority in 
the second Clinton administration and some kind of initiative would 
be forthcoming to resolve the Kashmir dispute.
    
Compiled by 28 prominent think-tank members, diplomats and former 
senior officials in various US administrations, the report says the 
US does not have a great deal of leverage in regard to the Kashmir 
dispute.
    
The time is not ripe for Washington to launch a major new 
initiative, it says, emphasising that US interests in both India 
and Pakistan would be best served at this time by working with 
other governments on a step-by-step approach towards a series of 
practical interim objectives. The US ought to pursue mainly quiet 
diplomacy in regard to Kashmir, producing modest but incremental 
steps to ease tensions and reduce friction between the protagonists 
with the help of other countries, it says.
    
Outlining the broader framework of what the new US policy towards 
Kashmir should be, the Task Force says the US should explore the 
possibility of forming a contact group of external powers to co-
ordinate international efforts.
    
The overall goal of these efforts should be to achieve an interim 
set of agreements, or even informal understandings, rather than to 
settle what in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process have been 
termed final status issues.
    
The US, it continues, in concert with other governments should seek 
to lower tension and violence, reduce military forces and restore 
political normalcy in Kashmir. Specifically, India and Pakistan 
should be urged to undertake regular and sustained bilateral 
negotiations directed towards a ceasefire and a halt to military 
actions (other than patrols for strictly defensive purposes) along 
the Line of Control in Kashmir, the reconstitution and increased 
monitoring of peacekeeping machinery along the boundary, 
supplementing UN sponsored efforts and renewed negotiations for a 
separate, rapid agreement over the withdrawal of both Pakistani and 
Indian military forces from their present positions on the Siachen 
Glacier.
    
Pakistan, it says, should be urged to end direct and indirect 
military support to Kashmiri insurgent organisations and India 
should be urged to continue and accelerate moves to resurrect the 
political process in Kashmir, including grants of amnesty for those 
insurgents willing to abjure violence, punishment for those members 
of the security forces involved in human rights violations and 
conduct of discussions with the newly elected Kashmiri government 
about the degree of autonomy for the state within the Indian 
constitution.
    
The report notes that formidable obstacles stand in the way of 
achieving even these limited objectives. A more ambitious 
settlement effort will only be practical if the local parties 
sought such assistance and showed both a real interest in reaching 
a compromise and the capacity to do so.

<a name="zard">Zardari released on bail</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 8: Hakim Ali Zardari, father-in-law of the deposed 
prime minister, was released on bail on Wednesday.
    
He was picked up by the FIA on Jan 1 for questioning in connection 
with a case. Mr Zardari, released against a surety of Rs 200,000, 
told correspondents on phone that he had decided not to contest the 
National Assembly elections from NA-161.
    
He said his release was a moral victory and vindicated his claim 
that he was falsely implicated in the case to bring pressure on him 
and the deposed prime minister.
    
He said while in FIA custody he was kept in isolation and even 
denied his medicines.
    
They had no case against me, said Mr Zardari and added that he 
had spoke on phone with his daughter-in-law to inform her about his 
decision not to contest the poll. Mr Zardari did not cite any 
reason for not contesting the elections although before his arrest 
he had shown great enthusiasm.
    
Dr Mushtaq Rahu would now be the PPP candidate from Sakrand in his 
place. But Faryal Talpur, younger sister of the interned spouse of 
Ms Bhutto, would remain in the contest from NA-160. She has already 
started her election campaign.

<a name="elec">Elections on time, pledges CDNS</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Jan 8: A six-hour long first meeting of the Council for 
Defence and National Security (CDNS) here on Wednesday focused on 
measures to subject the corrupt politicians and bureaucrats to 
ruthless accountability.
    
A press release issued by the Presidents House said that the 
meeting dispelled all rumours regarding the postponement of the 
elections and the CDNS reaffirmed governments resolve to hold 
free, fair and impartial polls on Feb 3.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the CDNS, which was presided over 
by president Farooq Leghari and attended by the prime minister, 
chairman joint chief of staff committee, three services chiefs and 
ministers for foreign affairs, defence and interior, discussed 
fresh measures to bring to the book all the corrupt elements 
whether politicians, bureaucrats or from the services.
    
Sources said the meeting expressed its serious concern over the 
mounting corruption in the society and it was agreed that without 
conducting ruthless and across-the-board accountability the menace 
of corruption would not eliminate.
    
The CDNS also discussed the issue that whether front-line leaders 
of major political parties against whom sufficient proof of 
corruption was available should be taken to task or not. However, 
sources said it was the consensus of the meeting that fair, free 
and transparent elections should be the priority of the caretaker 
government so that nobody could find an excuse to boycott the 
polls.
    
The Council expressed its confidence that the people of Pakistan 
will support the government in all steps taken to carry forward the 
democratic process, measures for improvement of the economy and the 
smooth and peaceful transfer of power to their representatives.

<a name="agre">Agreement with PSI cos to cost Rs 8 billion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Jan 5: Pakistan will lose approximately Rs 8 billion due 
to what the Law Division has termed as a defective pre-shipment 
inspection agreement with SGS/Cotecna by the time the notice of its 
termination becomes effective on March 11 this year, an informed 
source told Dawn.
    
He ruled out the possibility of recovering the loss because the 
agreement was formulated in such a manner as to benefit only the 
PSI companies with no commitment on their part to increase the 
revenues to the government and with no provision for penalising 
these companies in the case of any irregularity. Even their promise 
that their fees would be covered by additional revenues to be 
generated as a result of their operations has proved to be empty. 
For whatever improvement in proceeds from import taxes there has 
been over the past two years would have been possible even without 
their good offices. What is more, the source asserted, the country 
suffered huge loss in terms of revenues, delays in clearance of 
goods including industrial raw materials and consequent rise in 
cost of production.
    
A regrettable aspect of the affair is that we plunged into the 
venture with our eyes wide open, the source remarked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 3: A team of experts from the Japanese financial giant 
Nomura Securities has arrived in Pakistan to work a out a deal with 
the government for the further privatisation of Pakistan 
Telecommunications Limited. 
    
Sources told Dawn that the Nomura team had flown in prior to the 
New Year and was working closely with the Privatisation Commission. 
The sources said that a deal for the further privatisation of the 
PTCL had almost been reached with members of the Nomura team. 
Exactly what percentage of the PTCL stock would be privatised in 
this round was not yet fully finalised, they said.
    
Twenty-six percent of the PTCL stock had already been sold to 
private investors during the dismissed PPP government which 
generated around $900 million. Privatisation Commission Chairman Dr 
Salman Shah has recently said in an interview that the government 
would press ahead with plans to privatise a number of large public-
sector enterprises including PIA and KESC, and to further privatise 
PTCL.
    
He has also said that within 50 days a regulatory framework to 
oversee these processes are expected to be initiated and 
established.

<a name="sbps">SBP sets domestic credit plan at Rs137.10bn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, Jan 5: The State Bank of Pakistan is expanding 1996-97 
domestic credit plan to Rs 137.10 billion as against the original 
target of Rs 102 billion set earlier in July, 1996.
    
This is being done because of the excessive borrowing of Rs 71.7 
billion by the government for budgetary support till Dec. 12 last 
as against the original projection of Rs 20 billion in the original 
credit plan approved by the National Credit Consultative Council 
(NCCC) early in July, 1996.
    
This excessive borrowing on part of the government has upset the 
entire credit plan for 1996-97 and the State Bank is coming up with 
an upward revised plan in the next quarterly meeting being held 
next Wednesday.
    
The new upward revised plan now projects government borrowing for 
budgetary support at Rs 44 billion indicating that there would be 
contraction of about Rs 28 billion in the next more than five 
months and the government hopes to push up revenue generation or 
cut down its expenses.
    
Overall, the revised credit plan sets a target of Rs 123 billion or 
13.10 per cent expansion in monetary assets and Rs 137 billion or 
14.18 percent in domestic credit.
    
The original credit plan indicated expansion of 10.55 per cent or 
Rs 102 billion in domestic credit and Rs 116 billion or 12.36 per 
cent in monetary expansion during 1996-97.
    
According to State Bank sources, these changes have been made in 
line with the emerging economic scenario of revision in sectoral 
credit in the credit plan 1996-97. Public sector share in the new 
credit plan has been placed at Rs 60.70 billion as compared to 
original Rs 42 billion.
    
The original public sector outlay of Rs 42 billion included Rs 20 
billion for budgetary support, Rs 5 billion for commodity 
operations and Rs 14 billion utilisation of privatisation proceeds 
and Rs 3 billion for autonomous bodies.
    
Under the new credit plan for public sector, the government is 
expected to contain its borrowing for budgetary support to Rs 44 
billion, Rs 5 billion for commodity operations and utilisation of 
privatisation proceeds Rs 8.7 billion and Rs 3 billion for 
autonomous organisations.
    
Till Dec. 12, 1996, the public sector utilised Rs 68.72 billion 
which include Rs 71.70 billion governments borrowing for budgetary 
support, retirement of Rs 8.8 billion of commodity loan operations, 
and Rs 203 million from Zakat fund.
    
Private sector was allocated Rs 60 billion for the entire 1996-97 
against which Rs 46.17 billion were utilised till December, 1996, 
and the State Bank now proposes to enhance it to Rs 63.80 billion.
    
Within public sector, limit on government borrowing for budgetary 
support has been enhanced to Rs 44 billion compared with Rs 20 
billion estimated originally.
    
Credit provisions for commodity operations and autonomous bodies 
have been kept unchanged at Rs 5 billion and Rs 3 billion 
respectively, while use of privatisation proceeds by government has 
been placed at Rs 8.7 billion.
    
The participants to the meeting will also come to know that 
domestic credit expansion during the period under review was barely 
brought about by the public sector, which contributed Rs 68.73 
billion (7.11 per cent) on the overall domestic credit expansion as 
against the targeted expansion of Rs 42 billion (4.34 per cent) for 
the whole year and an actual expansion of Rs 53.28 billion (6.99 
per cent) in the corresponding period last year.
    
Within the public sector, government borrowing during first half of 
the current fiscal year (1996-97) recorded a sharp rise of Rs 71.70 
billion as against the credit plan target of Rs 20 billion for the 
entire year and an actual expansion of Rs 50.33 billion in the same 
period last year.
    
The government borrowings on account of commodity operations 
however recorded a fall of Rs 8.86 billion compared with a lower 
fall of Rs 3.12 billion in the same period of the preceding year.
    
Credit by financial institutions other than commercial banks, 
however, showed a contraction of Rs 1.26 billion during July 1 to 
December 12, 1996, compared with an actual expansion of Rs 2.93 
billion in the same period last year.
    
Latest data for cotton financing available upto November 28, 1996, 
show that bank credit to finance cotton rose by Rs 13.90 billion 
from Rs 13.58 billion as of June 27, 1996, to Rs 27.48 billion as 
of November 28, 1996.
    
Component-wise credit to ginners rose (Rs 8.48 billion to Rs 8.74 
billion) followed by millers (Rs 5.51 billion to Rs 16.47 billion) 
and shippers (+0.05 billion to Rs 0.57 billion).
    
Credit to Cotton Export Corporation (CEC) and to traders on the 
other hand declined by Rs 0.09 billion and Rs 0.06 billion 
respectively.
    
Disbursement of funds made by commercial banks under Export Finance 
Scheme since June 30, 1996, stood at Rs 35.24 billion compared with 
Rs 31.32 billion disbursed in the same period last year showing an 
improvement of 12.5 per cent.
    
Net expansion by commercial banks on this account amounted to Rs 
3.30 billion from July 1 to December 12, 1996, compared with Rs 
3.45 billion in the same period last year.
    
Production loans disbursed to agriculture sector for Rabi crop 
during July to October, 1996, amounted to Rs 3.50 billion. Within 
it, credit under mandatory scheme by commercial banks amounted to 
Rs 1.48 billion. During the same period, loans disbursed by ADBP 
amounted to Rs 1.19 billion while credit extended by PBC through 
Provincial Co-operative Banks aggregated to Rs 0.93 billion.
    
Net credit expansion by commercial banks during July to October, 
1996, in the areas of small business and small industry was Rs 0.54 
billion and Rs 2.40 billion compared with an expansion of Rs 0.15 
billion and Rs 0.76 billion respectively in the same period last 
year.

DHAKA, Jan 5: The intra-regional trade in South Asia could rise to 
the tune of $11 billion by the year 2015 if the countries in the 
region cooperate among themselves in land transport, communication 
network and transit facilities.
    
A 1994 study suggested that under the existing state of cooperation 
among the economies of Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Sri 
Lanka, the total intra-regional trade would rise slightly above $3 
billion by the year 2000 and further to the level of $9 billion in 
2015.
    
The same study observed that improved communications, transport 
network and transit facilities among all the countries in the 
region would raise the trade volume of over $11 billion a year by 
2015.
    
The scenario was conjured up in the keynote paper by Dr M. 
Rahmatullah, Director, Transport, Communications and Tourism 
Division of UN-ESCAP, at a national seminar on Asian Land Transport

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Jan 7: The State Bank of Pakistan has stopped the Regional 
Development Finance Corporation (RDFC) and the Small Business 
Finance Corporation (SBFC) from financing Locally Manufactured 
Machinery (LMM).
    
The SBP announced the decision through a circular (BPRD No 01) on 
Tuesday.  The circular said the SBP had decided to exclude RDFC and 
SBFC from the list of Nationalised Commercial Banks (NCBs) and 
Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) authorised to provide 
finances under LMM financing scheme. It said the decision would go 
into effect immediately.
    
Under the LMM scheme, NCBs and DFIs provide finances to the 
industries for purchasing locally manufactured machinery on 
subsidised rates. The SBP compensates the difference between 
average lending rates worked out on the basis of prevailing yield 
on Short Term Federal Bonds and the subsidised rate. 
   
Currently financing under LMM scheme is made on 14.0 percent while 
the yield on STFBs hovers around 17 percent. Financing under this 
scheme is available for both local as well as export-oriented 
industries. The only condition is the machinery the financing of 
which is being subsidised is sold locally.

<a name="10pc">10pc increase in gas prices okayed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 8: The caretakers have decided to further increase 
gas  charges by 10 per cent to meet one of the major 
conditionalities of the International Monetary Fund.
    
Reliable sources told Dawn here on Wednesday that the new increase, 
which had already been approved by the caretaker cabinet, would be 
effective from March. Earlier, the present government had announced 
an increase of 15 per cent in the gas prices following the approval 
of the cabinet which met here on December 27.
    
These sources said that the cabinet originally wanted to raise the 
gas prices by 25 per cent in one go, as desired by the IMF. But in 
order to avoid an adverse public reaction to such a massive 
increase , it was decided to stagger the increase in two 
instalments with a gap of two months.
    
An increase of 15 per cent was announced in the press briefing soon 
after the cabinet meeting on December 27. However, there was no 
mention about the impending 10 per cent increase.
    
Subsequent to the proposed increase of 10 per cent, the caretaker 
government will follow a new price adjustment formula allowing the 
petroleum ministry to increase the prices of gas in future in 
proportion with the increase in the cost of production.
    
The sources said that since the decision for the next increase has 
already been approved by the cabinet so the raise will perhaps be 
made from March 1.

<a name="comm">Commission to propose tax reforms</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 8: The caretakers have constituted two separate 
Commissions to propose progressive tax reforms, and further 
deregulation of the Pakistani economy.
    
Former Deputy Chairman Planning Commission and former secretary 
finance, Mr Saeed Qurashi and former secretary economic affairs 
division Mr R.A. Akhund would head commission on tax reforms and 
Commission on Deregulation respectively. These two commissions were 
set up other than 13 task forces, two of which were also on tax 
reform and privatisation and deregulation.  The interim government 
had received recommendations of the Task Forces which were 
incorporated in the president Farooq Legharis economic package 
announced in late December.
    
We would look at the current tax administration and tax with GDP 
ratio and propose removal of structural anomalies due to which 
there is no proper revenue generation, said Mr Saeed Qurashi.
    
He told Dawn here on Wednesday that the commission would also 
examine tax exemptions in order to broaden the tax base of the 
country. We would propose structural changes so that the tax 
administration is improved in Pakistan and leakages eliminated, he 
added.
    
The former Deputy Chairman Planning Commission agreed that 
previously some work was done for improving tax administration. He 
said that the report of the Task Forces on tax reforms would also 
be looked into by the commission.
    
Answering a question, Mr Saeed Qurashi said that one of the 
important issues was the implementation of various kinds of 
recommendations. 
 
We plan to propose such measures which should be easy to implement 
by the concerned authorities. He said that his commission would 
also ensure that there was a computerisation of the revenue system 
in the absence of which there was no proper tax collection.
    
According to details, these Commissions would develop detailed 
strategies for tax reform and deregulation.

<a name="stat">State Bank to take over PBC assets, liabilities</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Jan 8: The Governor of State Bank of Pakistan, Dr Muhammad 
Yaqub, announced here on Wednesday that the SBP would take over all 
the assets and liabilities of the Pakistan Banking Council, being 
abolished under new laws.
    
He also said that the SBP would submit quarterly reports on the 
state of the economy to the parliament without taking dictates by 
the government.
    
He told a meeting of the heads of banks and Development Finance 
Institutions that an ordinance would be issued to bring changes in 
the laws governing the financial sector within a day or two.
    
These changes give extensive powers to the State Bank for the 
regulation of the banking system..., a source privy to the meeting 
quoted the governor as saying.
    
He said the governor asked all the banks and DFIs to apprise the 
SBP of their credit policies in detail within 30 days and get them 
approved.
    
The governor told us that key changes are being made in the State 
Bank Act to raise its autonomy in framing and implementing the 
monetary policy, the source said.
    
He told us that after the proposed amendments in the Act the SBP 
Board of Directors would determine the level of monetary expansion 
without seeking the government approval, the source added.
    
Similarly, the private sector credit requirement would also be 
projected by the SBP and not by the government, the source quoted 
the governor as saying.
    
He said by determining the level of monetary expansion and 
projecting the private sector credit requirements played a vital 
role in checking inflation by reducing the demand and increasing 
production. Checking inflation in Pakistan has been an uphill task 
largely because of political interference in the two areas, he 
added.
    
Dr Yaqub said the Monetary & Fiscal Policy Board would be 
restricted to co-ordination of policies and determining the extent 
of government borrowings from commercial banks which would be 
undertaken through market mechanism.
    
Quoting the governor the source said a new section was being added 
in the State Bank Act that would shut the doors of political 
interference in the financial system forever.
    
According to an SBP press release the proposed sub section (46-B) 
says that no governmental or quasi governmental body or agency 
shall issue any directive directly or indirectly to any banking 
company or any other financial institution regulated by the SBP 
which is inconsistent with the policies/regulations/directives 
issued by the SBP.
    
The sub-section adds: Any such inconsistent directive issued by 
any governmental or quasi governmental body or agency shall have no 
effect and be deemed to be null and void.
    
Sources said the governor told the meeting that after the 
amendments in the State Bank Act the SBP Board alone would have the 
authority to make changes in the fiscal and monetary policy and not 
the government.
    
They quoted him as saying that the SBP Board of Directors would be 
re- constituted. The sources said the SBP chief did not say what 
specific changes would be made in the Boards composition.
    
They said the governor also told the meeting that under some 
changes being made in the Bank Nationalisation Act the approval for 
setting up new banks would be issued by the SBP and not by the 
government.
    
Similarly the SBP  not the government  would give final 
permission for the opening of branches of foreign banks in Pakistan 
and those of Pakistani banks abroad.
    
They quoted him as saying that the chairman of the PBC as well as 
its staff would be retained at the SBP.
    
Dr Yaqub said that the SBP would prepare and retain a panel of 
senior bankers and appointments of the presidents and chairmen of 
the nationalised banks will be made from amongst the panel.
    
The sources privy to the meeting said the governor said the SBP 
would also lay down eligibility criteria for the heads of local and 
foreign private banks operating in the country adding the violation 
of it would be penalised.
    
They quoted the governor as saying that the Board of Directors of a 
bank would make the policy and its chief would only implement that. 
No CEO would be allowed to change policies on his own.
    
According to the SBP press release, Dr Yaqub said the Board members 
of nationalised banks and DFIs would not be less than 5 and more 
than 7 and that they would be appointed for 3 years.
    
The governor also said that eight key amendments had been made in 
the Banking Companies Ordinance. According to the amendments, 
penalty rates on various violations have been multiplied by 10 
times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

A NATION can only be strong if its citizens collectively have the 
guts to acknowledge their follies, their shortcomings, their sins 
of commission and omission, their misdeeds, their self- deception, 
their bigotry, their hypocrisy, their sycophancy their lies, their 
false values, their ineptitude, their selfishness and their greed.
    
Fifty years after the nasty British departed leaving us as an 
independent country, governance-wise what have we on the ground 
today?
    
On October 20, 1993, the Oxford-educated Daughter of the East 
manipulated her way into the prime-ministerial palazzio for the 
second time. Few in the world are given a second chance in life to 
rule over some 140 million people. Not even pretending to be 
chastised, not even simulating remorse after she was thrown out 
less than halfway through her first term in office, she made no 
attempt to mend her ways. When she came back, she came back with a 
vengeance. She, her family, her camp followers and her cronies, all 
made merry at the countrys expense.
    
Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan, Tumandar Leghari, by all accounts a 
gentleman until inducted as President of the Republic by Benazir, 
tolerated her and her foibles, kept mum whilst she and her men and 
women did all that they did for three long years. In mid-1996 he 
began trying to persuade her to mend her ways. She did not, and in 
November he, with the necessary aid and acquiescence of the real 
power of the land, finally turned, and exercised the only option 
open to him and dissolved the rot-ridden National Assembly.
    
The COAS, General Jehangir Karamat, at the head of a disciplined 
Army, expressed his desire and that of his men to refrain from 
having to meddle in politics and allowed Leghari to independently 
exercise his duty under Article 48(5)(b) to appoint a caretaker 
cabinet. The Army would aid the civil power and take care of the 
streets.
    
The President fell flat on his face. He inducted a well- meaning, 
well past his prime, pliable prime minister, Meraj Khalid, who, in 
his wisdom, appointed Shahid Nabi Malik (a former income tax 
commissioner) and S.M. Ismail (a protigi of Salman Faruqui) as his 
advisers. Loose Cannon Meraj Khalid is trying to awaken the people 
so that they arise and exercise their will. His way of doing it 
seems to be by compounding confusion by issuing conflicting daily 
statements.
    
The president also inducted into his cabinet his brother-in- law 
and Ghaffar Jatoi who had allotted to himself in Clifton, Karachi a 
peoples amenity plot of 15,000 sq. yds. which he has had converted 
into a commercial enterprise. He also allowed two Benazir appointed 
governors, Azfar and Imranullah who had been a party to much wrong, 
to continue. When a government is dismissed on the grounds of 
misgovernance, abuse of power, and intolerable corruption it is 
necessary that its replacement is beyond and above all suspicion. 
The old adage about the one rotten apple in the barrel inevitably 
holds true.
    
The agenda of the President and his team so far appears to be not 
to disqualify either Benazir or Nawaz or their partners. This has 
not gone down well with the people, who are manifesting their 
disgust and anger at the same faces being allowed to stand once 
again for election and they are bitterly questioning the object of 
the presidential exercise. The Army, too, is said to be at one with 
the people and it has had to make public statements disassociating 
itself from the doings of the Leghari caretaker government.
    
Apparently, some sort of a deal has been struck with Nawaz which 
will allow Leghari to remain in his big house for the remainder of 
his term and for a second round. Nawaz is not renowned for keeping 
his promises. He has ditched many a man with whom he made a deal, 
one being a fellow Tumandar of Leghari. If this be true, it is a 
most selfish act.
    
Nawaz is no angel. I have maintained that in comparison to Benazir 
he is the lesser of the two evils, it is unnees- bees, as the 
saying goes. He has done us enough harm. He and Brother Shahbaz run 
a close second to Benazir and Asif.
    
On my hard disk, I have the following paragraphs that I wrote about 
Nawaz and his doings just before he was dismissed. On April 16 
1993, I wrote:
    
We now move over to the Prime Ministers palace, wherein sits a 
poor little rich man with more than enough power and authority to 
rule as he likes over the 123 million people, and he has chosen the 
autocratic way. His power of concentration is measured in seconds. 
His knowledge of history is such that mention of Metternich to him 
may conjure up visions of a steel girder. Not knowing history, how 
can he know that history almost invariably repeats itself, first as 
a tragedy and then as a farce? His sole fear is the 8th Amendment 
which, above all, enables the President to get rid of him. He wants 
unbridled power, unbridled authority, and perpetuation. The 
Sharifs, like the Bhuttos, now imagine they were born to rule 
over us... Is any constructive work done in parliament? Does he 
bother to attend its sessions? To please everyone in his camp, as 
he must, he chose to have a cabinet of over 40 men. Some cabinet! 
And some men! Just look at Boy Scout Ghous! Their Prime Minister 
cares a damn about most of them, apart it is said from the 
favourite Five. There are ministers who say that they have not been 
able to get to meet him for over a year.
    
Whereas the President is backed by our Army, the Prime Minister is 
backed by our money which he spends with utter disdain for his own 
selfish good.
    
Then on April 23:
    
Second in line Nawaz, foolish man, had everything going for him. 
He was happily sitting atop the second highest hill in Islamabad, 
he had more than enough power to rule well and wisely... 
Industrialists, merchants and the fat-cats who benefited and who 
now talk in his favour maintain that corrupt as he was (he and his 
men were far more adept at corruption than Bibi and her men) he at 
least gave something back to the country... but not one concedes 
that this gave Nawaz licence to indulge in unforgivable massive 
scams, any right to practise thuggery, to violate human rights, to 
have people beaten up by his police, to harass editors and 
journalists and implicate them in false cases, to humiliate his 
relatives, male and female, who differed with him and his part of 
the family that has clout...
    
By nature and behaviour Nawaz is a fascist, whose greed and 
ambition has no bounds. His politics made him the largest and 
richest industrialist of Pakistan but this did not satisfy his 
want. He lusted for more power than necessary, he aimed at the 
perpetuation of himself and his progeny, and, egged on by Bibi, he 
thought he could take on the ageing leader of the herd. He thought 
that with his purchasing power (the peoples money he had 
appropriated) he could even buy some in uniform, split their ranks, 
and win.
    
Two days ago, Mumtaz Bhutto stated that during Benazirs second 
round Rs. 60 billion worth of land in Sindh was given away or 
allotted for sums totalling Rs 2 billion. Yesterday, Imran accused 
Nawaz of having allotted plots worth Rs 5 billion for political 
patronage when he was chief minister of Punjab, long before he 
became prime minister. If this was all anyone had against them 
both, we would still be solvent.
    
To those who bluff themselves, referring to this country as a 
democracy, my questions are:
    
 Can a democracy afford not to have a census for sixteen years 
thus rendering every (repeat every) statistic  fiscal, commercial 
or constituency-wise or otherwise  incorrect?
    
 In what sort of democracy do known robbers, pillagers, looters of 
public wealth, breachers of trust, misappropriators of widows and 
orphans Baitul Maal, Zakat and Iqra funds, contest elections to 
its parliament?  In what sort of a democracy does a chief of army 
staff publicly accept crores of rupees from a corrupt banker (later 
jailed) and preside over its dubious expedient disbursement to 
politicians?
    
 In what sort of a democracy would a chief of naval staff give 
away the entire seafront of a naval base to the crony of a 
political bigwig ostensibly to develop a tourist resort?
    
 In what sort of a democracy would the president, prime and other 
ministers, and senior bureaucrats fly a thousand miles (some on 
special flights) at the peoples expense to attend the wedding of 
an offspring of the countrys naval chief?
    
The list of questions is endless. To those that insist that the 
will of the people must prevail, let it prevail, let the President 
hold a referendum (constitutionally provided), let the people 
decide whether they want Ehtesab before Intekhab.

<a name="wort">Worth of human life</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

WHAT single news-item could be used as a metaphor for 1996? Would 
best epitomise the human condition? There would be innumerable 
candidates but the one that has struck me as being particularly 
appropriate is this one: A peon was set on fire allegedly on the 
order of a Deputy Commissioner in the Indian State of Haryana.
    
It states: The 32-year old peon Matwar Singh who was put to the 
torch, succumbed to his injuries in a hospital in Chandigarh. 
According to reports the Deputy Commissioner Kaithal Amit Jha had 
ordered his security guard to douse him with kerosene and set him 
on fire. Matwar Singh used to do the cooking for the officer as 
well as work in his office. He had over-stayed his leave and the 
officer wanted to teach him a lesson. The incident has sparked 
protests by government employees. The employees were angry over 
reports that the state police have released the Deputy Commissioner 
on the ground that he had already acquired anticipatory bail from a 
sessions court.
    
Words fail me. Actually they dont otherwise this column would come 
to an end. There is so much in this news-item. There is the act of 
unspeakable brutality. There is the arrogance of power, the power 
over life and death literally that a master wields over his 
servant. And there is the anticipatory bail that all but suggests 
that the Deputy Commissioner will somehow wiggle out of this 
because he will find protection from his own kind. This is the 
contempt of power.
    
Thus I saw 1996 off, good riddance to a year that was remarkable 
for the amount of blood that was shed, whether it was shed through 
political violence as in Bosnia, Zaire, the Middle East or through 
social violence like the Dunblane massacre, or individual acts of 
murder. Pakistan had its share of these murders and indeed 
continues to have them. Oscar Wilde described a cynic as a man who 
knew the price of everything but the value of nothing. How do we 
describe those who neither know the price nor the value of a human 
life?
    
But these are morbid thoughts and one should think of something 
more cheerful or less grim to start the New Year. But I am not 
entirely convinced that the following news report that attracted my 
attention fits in this category. This newspaper carried a double 
column story about a lecture delivered by Ms. Nagla Nasser, 
Professor of Law, Tanta University, Egypt at the Area Study Centre, 
Quaid-i-Azam University. I am not sure whether there was an element 
of distortion or misreporting in the story but the views expressed 
by the good professor make challenging reading, to say the least.
    
She says that the basic task of the World Bank, the International 
Monetary Fund and the World Trade organisation is to facilitate the 
establishment of a new world economic order in which private 
enterprise will rule supreme and the national boundaries will cease 
to exist. According to her, the two Bretton Woods institutions have 
been given this task because, although the socialist bloc no longer 
existed, the old social attitudes were a hurdle in the way of the 
triumph of private enterprise. According to Ms. Nasser in the new 
economic order, the governments would lose their role and they 
would be supplanted increasingly by the private sector. In such an 
atmosphere of freedom everybody would have a chance to prosper. She 
described the United States as having the purest form of 
capitalism. And, obviously, approvingly, she defined the new 
economic order as the survival of the best.
    
There is something Darwinian about survival of the best and I am 
not sure whether even Adam Smith went so far. But if unalloyed free 
enterprise is going to be the future, then we will have to 
drastically revise our social and moral attitudes. In the middle 
sixties I had spent a few weeks in China and from there I went to 
Japan. I was able to have a meeting with Edwin Reichauser who was 
the US Ambassador and like Oakley in Pakistan was also referred to 
as the Viceroy of Japan. In his own right he was a distinguished 
scholar. He asked me many questions about China and I in turn asked 
him many questions about US policy in Asia. The discussion was 
about winning hearts in Asia. I had indicated that given the 
measureless poverty in Asia, the only ideology that would find 
receptive ears would be one that would address this poverty and the 
social calamities that this poverty produced. Was free enterprise 
that ideology? I did not get a straight answer but I got the 
impression that he did not disagree with me.
    
If indeed free enterprise is the future then we should be 
reconciled to abandoning the majority of mankind to their present 
wretched lives. And, if according to the good professor Ms. Nasser, 
the United States represented the capitalist system in its purest 
form then it is pertinent to point out that the largest single 
industry in the United States is organised crime. By the logic of 
the survival of the best there is nothing immoral about drug 
barons and they should be considered the success stories of the 
free enterprise system. And why should there be so much moral 
indignation about child labour?
    
The collapse of communism, as represented by the disappearance of 
the Soviet Union does not Ipso facto establish the superiority of 
free enterprise. Free enterprise cannot be projected as an 
ideology. It is a mechanism. When the need arose, as in the 
Depression years in the United States, free enterprise was greatly 
modified and Franklin D. Roosevelts New Deal, according to FDRs 
enemies was nothing but socialism. The new economic order, if there 
is to be one, will have to abandon its messianic zeal and deal with 
the real world. The profit motive cant be placed alongside 
saintliness. Happy New Year.

<a name="haja">Haj at public expense</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

DURING the course of a TV debate on Jan 1, Senator Khurshid Ahmad 
of the Jamaat-i-Islami brought up the issue of performing Umra and 
Haj at public expense which, he said, had no sanction in Islam and 
was in fact against shariah. Objections to official Haj delegations 
on this ground have several times been made previously. This is an 
important issue which has been agitating the minds of the people. 
The practice of sending delegations or individuals for Umra and 
Haj, started with the dignitaries of the State. This pernicious 
practice has now spread to many government departments and even to 
private sector enterprises. Haj is one of Islams five fundamental 
obligations and is obligatory only in the case of those persons who 
can afford its expenses after meeting the necessary and clearly 
defined liabilities towards their families. Performing Haj by 
spending other peoples money cannot be justified in any manner.
    
As regards private enterprises, the amount spent out of a firms 
account on sending employees and others for Haj or Umra forms part 
of the cost of its production and is incorporated in price. To that 
extent, it is almost a forced payment and might not find sanction 
in Islam. Wealthy and affluent persons are, no doubt, allowed to 
send indigent people for Haj, provided they meet the expenses from 
their personal income or wealth.
    
There is another dimension, too, to the problem which may be 
considered by religious scholars. The performance of Haj and Umra 
involves a huge expenditure of foreign exchange. The foreign 
exchange that we earn from export of goods and services and from 
the remittances we receive from Pakistani expatriates is not enough 
to pay for the essential goods and services that we import. The 
amount of foreign exchange that we spend on other items, including 
Haj, is obtained on loan on which we pay a hefty interest. It is 
for the religious scholars to deliberate on this aspect and come 
out with a solution that should ensure that foreign exchange used 
for the purposes of Haj is not tainted with interest.

<a name="dari">Daring crime</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ON the evening of the same day, Tuesday, that the Punjab IGP 
recounted his departments achievements at a Press conference in 
Lahore, one of the most daring dacoities took place in one of the 
busiest parts of the city. Four masked men looted six shops and a 
dozen people in the Lohari Gate area and made off with cash and 
gold worth Rs 2 million two motor-cycles were also stolen by the 
desperadoes who fired intermittently in the air to create panic 
among the citizens. Much more stunning was the relative ease with 
which they went about their business, looting shops and people one 
after the other and not sparing anyone who came their way. All this 
happened in a congested and busy part of old Lahore where the 
cheek-by-jowl existence of the inhabitants is sometimes considered 
a major security asset. Particularly disconcerting was the late 
arrival of the police who reached the spot an hour after the 
incident, when the dacoits had accomplished their deadly mission 
and were safely out of the laws reach. How the area police 
remained unaware of such an unusual commotion in their 
neighbourhood is a question that should be fully investigated by 
the IG. Moreover, this was not the first incident of its kind, 
especially in the busy marketplaces of old Lahore. Many previous 
dacoities have drawn howls of protest from the business community. 
Not surprisingly, there is great resentment among the people, with 
the areas shopkeepers announcing an indefinite strike in protest.
    
Have the police thrown in the towel or are there serious 
organisational deficiencies to account for such lapses? The usual 
practice of suspending local SHOs and forming investigation teams 
after each major incident seems inadequate to meet the growing 
threat to law and order. Scientific methods to deal with organised 
crime are needed and the administration should be seriously 
concerned about the peoples vanishing confidence in the police.

SYDNEY, Jan 2: The Pakistan cricket team was ordered to remove 
advertising logos from its cricket bats after the Australian 
Federal Government found the team had breached federal laws banning 
tobacco advertising.
    
The red-and-white logo of Wills Kings, a brand of cigarettes 
available in Pakistan, was clearly visible on the bats during 
yesterdays day-night match.
    
Health Minister Michael Wooldridges office confirmed letters 
outlining the governments position were being drafted to be sent 
to the Pakistan team. We have had legal advice that theres prima 
facie case that they have breached the (Tobacco Advertising 
Prohibition) Act, Dr Wooldridges spokesman told Dawn.

MELBOURNE: Whoever thinks that Test cricket is dead and buried

72,821 people watch the first days play in the traditional boxing 
day test between Australia and the West Indies. And that is after 
West Indies have been trailing in the five match series 2-0.

There is no denying the fact that the revenue generated by cricket 
and its mass appeal has helped the game to survive. But not all 
one-day games produce close results or excitement that one 
associates with it.
    
The good thing that goes with it is that it has helped to produce 
the type of cricketers, that the real connoisseur would like to 
watch and enjoy? Gone are the days of Hammonds, Sobers, Huttons, 
Chappells, Harveys and the likes of Hanif and Gavaskar, Zaheer and 
Miandad, who enthralled and enhanced the game.
    
The game that modern day cricketers play is all crash, bang, wallop 
and it is sad to see that all the subtleties that are associated 
with this glorious game of charming unpredictability are fading in 
the distance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

BRISBANE, Jan 3: In their six-wicket victory over Pakistan in the 
World Series, West Indies were made to struggle but they managed to 
survive the pressure and get past Pakistans 197 with 11 balls to 
spare.
    
In that they were lucky that their star batsman Brian Lara, was not 
given out off Mohammad Zahid by umpire Ross Emerson when the 
batsman was struck on the pad right in front of the wicket when he 
had not even scored a run.
    
Zahid, who in his 10 overs conceded only 29 runs for the prized 
wicket of Lara later on, bowled impressively but was unlucky. Lara 
escaped a few run-outs as well as was Sherwin Campbell to add 41 
runs for the third wicket after West Indies were two down for 37. 
Junior Murray, was bowled round his legs by Wasim Akram for 15, 
Adrian Griffith was run out by Saqlain Mushtaq from short mid-
wicket and when Campbell played on to Saqlain when 34, Pakistan 
were still in with a chance. But Lara, despite Zahids burst of 
pace and himself unsure of his stay at the wicket, survived to add 
46 more runs with Carl Hooper for the fourth wicket before being 
caught at the wicket by Moin off Zahid who came for his second 
spell. Lara was still uncomfortable against him.
    
Hooper and Jimmy Adams made the target look easier than it did as 
they pushed and nudged past the required target of 198 to win. 
Hooper reached his fifty, his 20th in 80 balls with two fours. For 
the unbroken stand for the fifth wicket he put on 74 runs with 
Adams who made 33. Hoopers unbeaten 54 earned him the man of the 
match award.
    
With two victories each for Pakistan, West Indies and Australia in 
four matches played so far, the competition is now wide open.

Pakistan batting was a huge disappointment after they had lost the 
toss and were asked to take the strike earlier on. Having Shahid 
Afridi caught at cover by Adrian Griffith and Aamir Sohail was 
induced to edge to the keeper on his first and second delivery of 
his second over, Courtney Walsh had dented the batting. Zahoor 
Elahi stayed briefly to add 33 with Ijaz Ahmed for the third 
wicket. And Inzamam-ul-Haq skied the ball behind Curtly Ambrose, 
the bowler, to be caught by Nixon McLean. But it was Ijaz Ahmed and 
Mohammad Wasim, who managed to steer the innings with a 73-run 
fifth wicket stand, to some kind of respectability.
    
Wasims run out while Ijaz was going for the third run was a wasted 
opportunity as substitute Robert Samuels throw came to the keeper. 
Wasim played a solid innings of 34. Wasim Akram went for a 
misjudged run and Ambrose had the last laugh to run him out.
    
Ijaz, who was dropped at 31 by Ian Bishop at long leg off McLean 
later reached his fifty in having faced 106 balls and struck two 
fours.
 
Ijaz, played not only with authority but also with responsibility 
to add 33 more runs with Moin Khan before being out for 59 off 
Walsh. His innings and that of Moin later, made 43 in 52 balls, was 
a big improvement over the poor start that Pakistan had losing two 
wickets for only 12 runs.
    
Bishop with 4 for 38 and Walsh with 3 for 40 had the major share of 
the wickets.

<a name="call">Call for international cricket players body growing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihithisham Kamardeen

PERTH, Jan 4: The calls are growing louder by the day for the 
urgent formation of an International Cricket Players Association 
(ICPA) for worlds elite players to have a greater say in the 
running of the game.
    
Waqar Younis, one of the games finest fast bowlers, joined the 
call for fewer one-day and spare international fast bowlers the 
whip to save and prolong their careers.
    
Cricket is getting too much, Waqar said after a shoulder injury 
ruled him out of Fridays one-day clash against the West Indies at 
the Gabba. There are too many one-dayers going. There is new 
pressure on you, every day, said Waqar, a veteran of 147 one-
dayers.
    
Mark Taylor and his West Indies counterpart Courtney Walsh will 
involve Pakistan skipper Wasim Akram in informal talks to consider 
the rights and entitlements of the international cricketers.
    
Following the recent outcry by the Australian Cricket Players 
Association (ACPA) after meaningless one-day series - such as 
recent visits to Sri Lanka and India - the Australian Cricket Board 
(ACB) is considering to remove it from future itineraries.

These days, international cricket calendars are bombarded with 
numbing number of one-dayer internationals in countries like 
Singapore, Canada and Kenya which bring in as much as US $700,000 
for participating nations a television revenue per tournament.
    
Three of the most influential players in world cricket - Taylor, 
Walsh and Akram - believe ICPA is imperative following the 
influence of Australia and West Indies domestic associations on 
their respective controlling bodies.
