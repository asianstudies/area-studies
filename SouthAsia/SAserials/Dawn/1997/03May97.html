<a name="paki">Pakistan to get $1.5bn from IMF, Consortium</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, May 2: Pakistan has successfully concluded talks with the Aid-
to-Pakistan Consortium and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which are 
expected to finalise 1.5 billion dollars new agreements on ESAF in 
September this year.
    
The IMF had agreed to have a monitoring staff for Pakistans economy after 
the budget in June and we hope to finalise 1.3 billion dollars to 1.5 
billion dollars new Extended Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in 
September next, said the Minister for Finance Senator Sartaj Aziz.
    
Speaking at a news conference here on Friday after his 10-day visit to 
Paris and the United States, he said that the Consortium and the IMF had 
praised the governments efforts to have long term structural changes for 
improving the economy, and assured all possible help to achieve various 
targets.
    
The major donors like Consortium, World Bank and the IMF have not asked 
for introducing new measures including the levy of new taxes in the next 
budget, he said and added that they hoped that Pakistans own home grown 
efforts would trigger a fundamental paradigm shift in the countrys policy 
framework.
    
Giving the details, he said that the Paris Club whose name has been changed 
as Pakistan Development Forum, was expected to offer 2.6 billion dollars 
for 1997-98. Overall, Pakistan was likely to receive 2.8 billion dollars 
for the next fiscal from these sources, he added.
    
The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and Japan would alone be 
providing 1.7 billion dollars which is more than the current years 
commitments, Aziz said.

<a name="rs41">Rs410m to be given to Gulf war victims</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 29: The Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) will 
distribute Rs410 million as compensation to the first batch of 4,126 
Pakistanis who were affected in Kuwait during the Gulf war.
    
The first instalment of Rs410 million is part of a total compensation 
package of $140.8 million approved by the United Nations Compensation 
Commission (UNCC) for 34,422 Pakistanis whose claims were approved.
    
A total of 44,457 Pakistanis, who fled Kuwait after the Iraqi invasion, had 
filed their claims in different categories announced by the UNCC.
    
The OPF spokesman, Tanveer Hussain, told Dawn that the distribution of 
compensation would start from May 2 to those affectees whose claims under 
categories A and C were approved by the UNCC.
    
He said the first instalment equivalent to Rs410 million for distribution 
among 4,126 affectees was received by the OPF this week. Of these 3,025 
claimants are in category A and 1,101 in category C.
    
He said those affectees who have already returned to Kuwait to take up 
their jobs have been asked to contact the Pakistan embassy for seeking 
details about the compensation plan. He said those who have sought jobs in 
other countries should contact the OPF directly on phone 92-51-9202457 to 
9202459 or fax 9211613.
    
Mr Hussain said the details of 4,126 beneficiaries had also been provided 
at the OPF offices in Karachi, Lahore, Quetta, Peshawar and in Mirpur, Azad 
Kashmir.

<a name="govt">Govt changes probe mode of corrupt elements</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 28: The federal government has appointed 130 experts 
lawyers, economists and senior police officers (DIG level)to investigate 
white collar crimes and financial bungling in the country.
    
We have a team of 130 people whose integrity is above board and who will 
investigate corruption charges against politicians and bureaucrats and get 
them punished without being partisan, said Senator Saifur Rehman, chairman 
Accountability Cell in the Prime Ministers Secretariat.
    
Talking to Dawn on Monday he disclosed that another list of corrupt 
government officials had been finalised for prosecuting them in the court 
of law. He said that the names contained in the list would be made public 
shortly.
    
The modus operandi of the investigation has been changed and now the 
members of our expert team would visit the organisation where a financial 
crime had been committed so as to complete the investigation as quickly as 
possible, he said.
    
Mr Rehman said that concrete cases were being prepared by the 
accountability cell so that nobody could get bail from courts after having 
been arrested.
    
Responding to a question he said that 91 government officials had been 
suspended on corruption charges and many more were expected to lose their 
jobs on similar charges. We are not afraid of anybody in preparing cases 
against corrupt bureaucrats, he said adding that the prime minister had 
instructed him not to care for the consequences and get hold of the black 
sheep no matter how influential they were.
    
To another question he said that the team of experts would soon visit 
several government corporations such as PTC, Steel Mills, PWDP etc. to 
conduct initial accountability of the corrupt elements.

<a name="toug">Tough foreclosure to salvage bad assets</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, May 2: Commercial banks are seeking tough foreclosure laws to 
salvage bad assets without any loss of precious time.
    
Sources said that they would not like to settle for anything less than 
unfettered right of both sale and foreclosure of mortgaged property 
without intervention of the court. They feel that a seven day notice to 
the borrowers should suffice.
    
With a mountain of debt weighing on their viability, the sources added, the 
nationalized commercial banks looked at the proposed law as part of their 
struggle for survival.
    
Bankers point out that under Section 12 (2) of Banking Companies (Recovery 
of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances Ordinance) 1997, the right of 
mortgagee bank to sell the mortgaged property without the intervention of 
the court to any person or to purchase the property on its own account, has 
been recognised. But the banks complain that this right can only be 
exercised when the banks hold a decree.
    
Sources said Section 11 of the ordinance gives power of attachment of 
property before the judgment and appointment of receivers for recovery of 
defaulted loans.
    
Lawyers are now busy drafting the amendments in the ordinance under advice 
of the ministry of finance and the State Bank.

<a name="jobs">Jobs against quotas to get legal cover</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, April 29: The government is considering to amend the 
Constitution to continue appointments based on regional quotas.
    
Sources told Dawn that following a recent judgment (announced on April 16) 
of the Supreme Court preventing further appointments on the basis of 
quotas, the Establishment Division has moved a summary for the Law Ministry 
with a request to amend the Constitution so that such appointments may 
continue.
    
The law division has been asked to get a constitutional amendment bill 
passed from the parliament in this regard. The law ministry will now study 
the different aspects of the proposal and will suggest an amendment for 
final approval.
    
We believe that this constitutional amendment would be introduced and 
passed in the forthcoming session of the National Assembly, a source said, 
and added that the Supreme Courts judgment had tied the governments hands 
in making appointments based on quotas.
    
The Supreme Court had observed that appointments on the basis of quota 
could not be made any more as the period specified for such recruitment had 
already expired. The apex court added that the quota system had not served 
national interest; on the contrary it had generated parochial and class 
feelings, resulting in disunity.
    
Appointments on the basis of quota were first provided for 10 years in the 
1973 Constitution. Later, it was extended for another 10 years through a 
presidential order by General Ziaul Haq. This period expired on September 
14, 1993, but the federal and provincial governments continued making 
appointments on quota basis.

<a name="newl">New law to shift onus of proof on to accused</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, April 26: The government has decided to amend the Ehtesab 
Ordinance to shift the burden of proof on the accused in an effort to 
recover the ill-gotten money from the corrupt government servants and 
politicians.
    
Khalid Anwer, the PMs adviser on law, told Dawn on Saturday that changes 
would be introduced in the banking laws to ensure immediate payment of the 
principal amounts by the defaulters.
    
The amended law asking the accused to prove that the allegation against him 
or her was not based on fact, would be a major shift in the countrys legal 
concept. Shifting the onus of proof on to the accused is universally 
considered a bad law but it has been introduced even in the United States 
recently. 
   
An accused in a drug trafficking case in the United States is now asked to 
prove that the charges against him were not correct.
    
The proposed changes in the Ehtesab Ordinance and the banking companies 
(recovery of loans, advances, credit and finance) Ordinance of 1997 would 
be introduced in the next session of the National Assembly scheduled for 
May 5.
    
The Ehtesab Ordinance, which would be made an act of parliament in the next 
session of the parliament, would be applicable to all segments of society 
except the armed forces. 

Mr Anwer hinted that the recovery of all bad debts amounting to Rs123 
billion, was next to impossible. The ministry of law has asked the State 
Bank to classify these debts into the principal amount, interest or mark-
up, and the date from which it had been outstanding.

<a name="unsh">Unscheduled loadshedding to cover up power crisis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
I H Raashed

LAHORE, April 26: With the atta crisis still persisting, Pakistan is 
facing yet another serious crisis  the acute power shortage forcing WAPDA 
to resort of unscheduled loadshedding to the extent of 1,700 megawatt (MW).

WAPDA s present capacity is reduced by about 40 per cent from 11,000 MW to 
6,300 MW due to a big drop in hydel power following depletion of two 
reservoirs at Mangla and Tarbela and repairs being undertaken at some of 
the thermal power plants.

As against generation capability of 6,300 MW, present summer demand has 
soared up to over 8,000 MW in all WAPDA regions, excluding Karachi. To save 
the system, WAPDA has started what it calls a load management programme and 
loadshedding, both undeclared and unscheduled, to enable the WAPDA staff to 
switch off power supply to any area at any time and for any duration of 
period.

In Lahore, as in other urban areas, power supply is suspended for hours and 
consumers are given the impression that the power had been switched off to 
undertake repairs and renovation work. Situation in rural areas is all the 
more alarming where power supply remains suspended from six hours to 12 
hours  adversely affecting the tube-well irrigation supplies which are 
much needed for Kharif crops sowing, particularly cotton.

<a name="mill">Millions lost in a day due to power shutdown</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Parvaiz Ishfaq Rana

KARACHI, April 26: The unscheduled power shutdown by KESC on Friday, 
lasting for over 9 hours, resulted in 1.3 million man-hour loss to the 
industrial units of SITE.
    
The industry sources said this loss in terms of rupees could not be 
precisely calculated but rough estimates put the production and revenue 
loss in millions of rupees.
    
These sources said that the SITE area houses over 2,500 industrial concerns 
employing around 0.5 million workers in three shifts per day. The general 
shift starting from 9 am to 5 pm has the highest strength of 200,000 
workforce, while the remaining two shifts known as b and c each have 
150,000 workers. The spokesman of the SITE Association said that the 
unscheduled loadshedding of Friday began at 4.15 pm and lasted till 12.10 
past midnight. This resulted in 9 hours production loss or 1.3 million man-
hour loss to 150,000 workers of b shift which daily starts at 3 pm to 11 
pm.
    
Responding to a question, he said we are in the process of calculating in 
rupee terms the per hour production loss the industry had to suffer on 
account of loadshedding. 
   
Invariably all the five industrial areas of the city have to suffer huge 
losses every summer when the KESC resorts to massive and unscheduled load 
shedding, he added.
    
He claimed that SITE industrial area alone contributes in taxes around 30 
per cent towards national exchequer, which comes to 50 per cent of the 
total revenue, the city of Karachi contributes.

<a name="areh">Are Hong Kong-based investors eyeing Karachi?</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Aslam

What relevance Karachi will have for the top world business after China 
takesover Hong Kong on July 1, is pretty hard to predict at this stage but 
initial signals received by their local counterparts are said to be fairly 
encouraging.
    
The islands entire $50 billion export trade conducted by the leading 
multinationals might not shift to Karachi but we hope to net a substantial 
part of it before the year is out, an optimistic textile tycoon is of the 
view and his assessment is apparently based on his close contacts with Hong 
Kong-based big business for the last several decades.
    
Karachi, Pakistans financial nerve centre, offers many attractive baits 
for the shaky foreign investors who have by now fully assessed the business 
growth potential of other Asian port cities and it seemed to have a 
distinct edge over the other potential safe havens.
    
Karachi has a sprawling export processing zone, having in its fold six 
dozens industrial units and warehouses owned by multinationals. 
   
Adjacent to it is port Qasim industrial estate housing among others, 
Toyota, Nissan, Pak-Suzuki car plants, ICI Pakistan, massive PTA unit and 
Fauji Fertilisers DAP production facilities. All these are connected with 
the mainland by road-railway links ensuring a local market of 130 million 
people.
    
Beyond it in the north-west 40-mile away from Karachi is Balochistan tax-
free Hub industrial estate, an eternal abode of Hubco, Pakistans largest 
private sector power plant, now fully operational generating 1,292 MW of 
power for the Hub and Karachi-based industry.
    
We want to make Karachi another business Hong Kong after the richest city 
of Asia with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $158 billion and per capita 
income of $25,000 rejoins its mother country after 150 years, said a 
leading textile made-up producer who has massive export orders for various 
products.
    
He, however, alleyed fears as the loud whispering suggest, that Karachi 
could become another Hong Kong in the political sense after 2000 as the 
exit of big Hong Kong-based business to the port city could altogether 
change the realities of the location advantages.
    
The local industrial elite, which luckily now weilds a massive electoral 
power and its chief exponents seem to have been playing a decisive role in 
allaying fears of Hong Kong big business about the political stability and 
legal protection to foreign investment and said to have convinced a good 
number of them to be their partners or work independently in a sellers 
market.
    
All investment might not come to this part of the world after the post-
July possible dispersal, there is a strong possibility of many opting for 
Karachi, as  they eye Central Asian and Eastern European markets, some of 
the industrialists who are today sharing political power hope.
    
The 1984 agreement between China and Britain stipulates, among other 
things, that the latter will not change the political status, trade policy 
and business rules of Hong Kong for the next 50 years after the July 1 
takeover but the foreign big business is a bit shaky despite a legal cover. 
Most of them are upset and are in search of alternatives but quietly.

Long before the Hong Kong-based foreign business is in search of alternate 
cities to shift their business and has conducted a number of pre-take-over 
surveys for the possible shifting places. Manila, Singapore, Japan and 
Karachi are said to be on the list for more than one reasons.
    
Karachi could well prove the safest as it ensures disciplined labour 
force, lower cost of production and vast selling outlets, some of 
visiting, foreign investors said. Singapore and Manila also offer the same 
facilities and an additional benefit of political stability but production 
cost there are too high.
    
We will not go to other Asian cities, including Bombay or other cities 
where nationalism is perceived as a possible threat to business, he added. 
High investment risk areas are India, Vietnam and South Korea, according to 
recently conducted survey by a Hong Kong-based Economic Risk Consultancy.

<a name="corr">Corruption, drug-trafficking and their mainsprings</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
R.M.U. Suleman

THE NEW PML government has decided to make corruption its first target in 
its drive for reforming the society and the economy. With a solitary or a 
few exceptions, politicians have, however, been spared to begin with, and 
all attention concentrated on the civilian establishment.
    
While the government was still trying to establish itself on this front, 
the seizure of a couple of kilogrammes of Pakistani heroin in New York 
showed that it had to be quite vigilant in respect of the military 
establishment also.
    
Mr Nawaz Sharif, soon after coming into power, had announced the start of 
the accountability process. The PM had also announced a drive to recover 
the looted money. For this purpose, the new government had decided to send 
references against corrupt politicians and bureaucrats.
    
It is true that all types of corruption is indulged in by either 
bureaucrats themselves or in connivance with them and the government 
decided to start from the bureaucrats. Time alone will show whether this is 
a correct and appropriate starting point.
    
So it was decided that lists of corrupt bureaucrats would be prepared. The 
Establishment Division was told to prepare a list of corrupt officers 
posted in the federal government and the provinces were directed to submit 
lists of such officers to the Establishment Division. It was further 
decided that in the first phase, a list of those officers who are facing 
inquiries on corruption charges would be prepared and taken care of.
    
Besides, the provincial governments, most of the federal 
ministries/divisions and other agencies have failed to furnish the required 
list of corrupt and dishonest officers to the Establishment Division 
within the prescribed time, viz March 20, for those facing disciplinary 
action or inquiries on corruption charges.

A total of 50 institutions, as well as the four provincial governments, 
were asked to furnish the required information, but till the end of March, 
only a little over a dozen of them had responded to the prime ministers 
call.
    
Those who failed to respond were the four provincial governments and a 
number of federal agencies, including the Central Board of Revenue. 
Earlier, the government had introduced amendments in the Ehtesab Ordinance 
to bring officers of Grade 18 and 19 under the purview of the ordinances, 
grant powers to the Chief Ehtesab Commissioner to pardon any accused and to 
arrest the accused even without the direct orders of the Ehtesab 
Commissioner. Officers of Grade 18 and 19 have also been brought under the 
ambit of the law. Previously only officers of Grade 20 and above could be 
tried under the Ehtesab Ordinance.
    
The Ordinance also does not provide for grant of pardon to an approver or a 
person who offers to make a full and true disclosure of the whole 
circumstances within his knowledge relating to an offence. The proposed 
amendment empowers the Chief Ehtesab Commissioner to give conditional or 
full pardon to a person who volunteers to give full information of the 
circumstances relating to an offence.
    
Before the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was suitably modified, the 
anti-corruption work of the Nawaz Sharif government and the Ehtesab 
Commissioner was somewhat restrained by occasional pontification from 
President Leghari.
    
Every government thinks of reining in the bureaucracy, and then misuses it 
to its own advantage, said the President. One of the major flaws with 
successive governments has been their unnecessary intervention in the 
affairs of the government. This practice, he concluded, had resulted in 
corrupting the system as elected representatives use it for their political 
motives.
    
President Leghari went to the extent of charging that the people had not 
given the new government the mandate to misuse its powers. The political 
clout is sometimes used to victimise the opponents through forced 
postings, he added. The real corruption, he concluded started from the top 
and if the people occupying the top offices were put on the right track, 
the affairs of the country could be managed easily.
    
To begin with, a list of 554 corrupt officers was compiled and released by 
the Prime Ministers Secretariat. Then there were 87 suspensions. It is no 
joke suspending or dismissing a federal secretary or for that matter an 
appraiser or inspector of customs or income tax department or the like.
    
The suspended bureaucrats include seven federal secretaries, many heads of 
banks and financial institutions and other officers belonging to different 
occupational groups and public organisations. Most of these officers got 
patronage promotions to their present position during the previous regime.
    
If the new appointments to these slots are based on merit, nothing like it. 
If one set of favourites is replaced by another set, there will be no 
national gain. In any case, full opportunity should be provided to the 
suspended officers to plead their case in a court of law so that justice is 
not denied to any one.
    
Mr Nawaz Sharif has dismissed two officials of CBR Customs for causing 
enormous loss to the national exchequer through fraudulent exports and 
illegal sanctioning of export rebates thereon. Earlier, he had removed from 
their jobs, two Commissioners of Income Tax who had been harassing 
assessees in respect of their forex investments.
    
It is universally recognised that corruption always moves from the top. 
Benazir Bhutto has been even more categorical in insisting that in Pakistan 
in general, and during her regime in particular, there had been hardly any 
corruption at the political level.
    
In support of her claim, the ousted PM presented the evidence that when the 
list of top defaulters was presented in the National Assembly, 97 per cent 
of them were not politicians, but businessmen. No bureaucrats were, of 
course, identified in this rogues gallery of bank defaulters.
    
Once a class becomes dominant and retains its dominance, the autonomy of 
the bureaucracy ceases to exist and it becomes an instrument in the hands 
of the dominant class.
    
Since the Pakistan bourgeoisie is also now in the process of establishing 
its dominance, the Pakistani bureaucracy will soon lose its autonomy and 
power still further. Even when the position of dominant classes in a 
society is fully crystallised, the need of the bureaucracy, civil and 
military, as junior partners in the crime of corruption still remains.
    
If the quantum of defaults are considered, and added to the default of 
surrogates, the politician will come out in a far worse light. What is 
worse is that hardly any bank recovery officer ever worries them or their 
surrogates. All their energies are concentrated on petty amounts of genuine 
Qarze Hasna defaults as a proof of their being active.
    
While the government was busy grappling with the problem of civilian 
corruption, it came face to face with some serious cases of individual 
corruption. Such cases had also been narrated, promptly withdrawn, nearly a 
year ago regarding the army involvement in movement of drugs, mostly 
inland. This time the recent exposure of the PAF officers involvement in 
heroin trafficking was the most glaring example of several such serious 
cases of indiscipline and greed.
    
Shortly before the recent heroin case, PAF officers had been found involved 
in smuggling computer parts, accessories and auto parts, the items high in 
value and low in volume and weight. It has even been suggested that about 
60 per cent of the computer market demand in Pakistan was channelled 
through the safest operation ran by a bunch of PAF officials.
    
It will be utterly wrong, however, to blame a vital military service for 
the failings of its personnel confronted with a dishonest situation. It 
should also be noted that all these stories relate to a specialised non-
combatant transport command.
    
The US drug market also represents a very dishonest situation, where the 
emphasis is entirely on the supply management. Opium demand management of 
the type preached to China by opium suppliers over a century ago is totally 
forgotten today. Nor is there any talk of reliance on free markets in 
relation to drugs.
    
No duty on taxes are charged on the imports made by the defence services of 
Pakistan. The majority of such imports are made through the usual official 
channels, but some classified import consignments are made through front 
companies and they are only cleared through verbal coded communications 
made between the collector of customs and the respective military commander 
in the area. Several instances had been reported in the past when the 
customs officials or their counterparts in the military services misused 
this facility for the smuggling of contraband items.
    
It is more than a century now that the worldly philosophers have had the 
humankind in their grip. In an ever expanding circle and with rising 
intensity, life is taken to mean matter, and matter life.
    
The depth of materialism and its concomitant corruption are, of course, not 
the same in all the climes. This is why in terms of corruption some 
countries are ranked first, some second and some in the immediate 
neighbourhood seventh, tenth, fifteenth, etc.
    
The differences are mostly situational. There is a great deal of truth in 
the trite saying that there are no dishonest persons. What we have are only 
dishonest situations. We cannot have honest politicians and a dishonest 
establishment and judiciary.  Honesty or dishonesty characterises a whole 
society and encompasses all its parts.

<a name="stat">State enterprises: to lay off or not to lay off</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtasham ul Haque

THE PML government is fearing a big political fallout if it lays off about 
223,000 employees and reducing the number of state-owned corporations from 
102 to 55 to effectively implement its revival of economic reforms package.
    
The Committee on downsizing headed by the Deputy Chairman of the Planning 
Commission, Dr Hafiz Pasha, is said to have completed its report, 
recommending the sacking of over 200,000 employees or laying off 
temporarily, until they are provided an alternative job. It also reportedly 
called for reducing the number of public sector enterprises from 102 to 55 
to run them efficiently and profitably. However, the government could not 
take any final decision fearing a serious political fallout.
    
Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto has already started claiming that the 
Nawaz Sharif administration would render one million employees jobless to 
implement what she termed an unworkable and inflation pronged economic 
reform package.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it is learnt, is convinced that downsizing of 
public sector corporations is inevitable and without it there was no hope 
to cut the non-development expenditure and achieve the budget deficit 
target of 4 per cent of GDP by the end of the current financial year. 
Currently, this fiscal deficit stands at 6.2 per cent and is a point of 
major concern for the donors specially the World Bank and the IMF.
    
Dr Pasha strongly supports the drastic cut in the number of employees in 
government and state enterprises and by recommending so he did not consider 
the political implications. Nevertheless, the government is in a fix. 
Publicly, nobody is ready to admit this massive retrenchment.
    
We have no plan to go for massive retrenchment, said the Minister for 
Water and Power and Petroleum, Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. When pressed, he 
told this correspondent there was no immediate plan to cut the number of 
employees.
    
Nisar is one of the few ministers and PML leaders who reportedly enjoy 
great access to, and the confidence of the prime minister.
    
Insiders said that he told the prime minister that the decision of 
downsizing would create problems for the government and that the matter 
should not be taken up at this early stage. He believed that if at all such 
a decision was inevitable it should be taken later.
    
We are very much conscious of the fact that the without implementing the 
revival of economic reforms package, things would not ease for the 
government and that perhaps it was the only solution to get rid of the 
current weak economic situation.
    
But then we can not ignore its implications, he said, hoping that the 
matter will be resolved soon.
    
The Prime Minister, he said, was also worried about it but did not want to 
take any hasty decision. Insiders said that the Privatisation Commission 
had also advised the prime minister to reduce the number of employees as 
well as the number of organisations.
    
However, when approached, the Chairman of the Privatisation Commission, 
Khawaja Muhammad Asif, said that there was no such thing on the cards and 
that he had not offered his opinion to the prime minister on the issue.
    
He said that he was given the assignment of privatising the remaining 
state-owned units to harness at least one billion dollars during the next 
financial year.
    
He was confident that after the privatisation of the Habib Credit and 
Exchange Bank (HCEB), the remaining units of the ghee corporation and 
fertiliser plants of the ministry of industries, along with a few other 
units would yield over one billion dollars during 1997-98.
    
To implement the economic package, the prime minister has been presiding 
over a number of meetings and the issue of downsizing was reportedly 
discussed in the April 17 meeting. 

He was told that the situation would further aggravate if some retrenchment 
was not carried out immediately.
    
According to Dr Pashas committee, there was scope for retrenchment in 
WAPDA, KESC, OGDC, Sui Southern and Sui Northern Gas companies and a couple 
of other organisations.
    
There was also one suggestion reportedly given by Khawaja Asif, that 
Pakistan Steel should be disbanded as it was only incurring huge losses for 
the last many years and had no justification to continue. 
   
However, his proposal was not accepted. The prime minister said that the 
mills would be made viable and ruthless accountability of those who had 
destroyed the mills would be undertaken.
    
Sources said that the prime minister was of the view, that all political 
appointees of the previous government should be dismissed from service but 
decided to delay implementation of the idea for some time.
    
The prime minister said that it would not be good to remove employees of 
lower grades. However, people who have been hired with big salaries must be 
removed to lessen the burden on the already depressed national kitty.
 
The caretaker adviser on finance, planning and economic affairs, Shahid 
Javed Burki, had first recommended the retrenchment of public sector 
employees. Now Dr Hafiz Pasha who had worked very closely with Mr Burki has 
also endorsed his recommendation. All said and done, this will be a test 
case for the government whether it takes any final decision over the issue 
of downsizing or keeps it pending due to political considerations. The 
Prime Minister has, however, said that it would be his priority to bring 
down fiscal deficit to 4 per cent of GDP in 1997-98, if not in 1996-97.

<a name="when">When armed forces also own commercial undertakings</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M. Ziauddin

PAKISTAN is probably the only country in the world whose defence forces 
earn more than half of their keep on their own as the commercial 
enterprises run by the charitable organisations of the army, navy and air 
force together contribute more than two per cent to the countrys GNP 
annually.
    
It is, therefore, a wonder why, so far the defenders of unrestricted and 
unscrutinised budgetary allocation for defence have not used this argument 
to win a billion or two more for the annual budget of our sentinels.
    
Stranger is it to see successive governments in the country, both military 
and political, not making effective use of the argument in their 
negotiations with the donors who have been consistently demanding a 
reduction in the defence budget.
    
Not only are our defence forces making money but they are also involved in 
massive social welfare activities as well. They run hospitals, schools, 
colleges, grant scholarships, manage vocational institutions and many other 
training centres. That they do all this exclusively for ex-service men and 
their families should not in any way lessen the value of these social 
welfare activities because if they were not doing it, the burden on the 
civilian budget would then have been more severe than what it is now.
    
In the private sector, if you put all the military foundations together, 
they become the single biggest industrial conglomerate. Ittefaq, owned by 
the prime ministers family, would come second with declared assets of a 
little less than Rs 9 billion.
    
Being a country severely short of resources and facing serious threats as 
well from across the border probably it could not think of any better way 
of making both ends meet and still live honourably.
    
Conceded that the fact that they are earning half of their keep does not 
obviate the need to rationalise and scrutinise the defence budget. And it 
also does not obviate the need to keep the defence forces out of politics 
and far removed from the business of making money and social welfare 
activities. But one cannot close ones eyes to a situation which amounts to 
a reality of nearly Rs 9 billion (net assets) and annual earnings of nearly 
Rs 2.5 billion.
    
The army has the Fauji Foundation (FF) and Army Welfare Trust (AWT), the 
Navy, the Bharia Foundation (BF) and the Air Force, the Shaheen Foundation 
(SF). The latter two are relatively new and therefore, relatively very 
small compared to the army conglomerates, the FF and the AWT.
    
The FF was established as a charitable trust incorporated under the 
Charitable Endowments Act 1890 in 1952 with an initial fund of Rs 18.2 
million and is exclusively devoted to the welfare of ex-servicemen of the 
armed forces of Pakistan and their families, whose estimated strength at 
present is over 7.5 million. Most army officers retire at the ripe young 
age of 45 while soldiers retire at the age of 35, so the need for an 
organisation exclusively looking after their welfare.
    
The Foundations are entirely self-supporting welfare organisations which 
operate in the private sector and receive no financial assistance from 
either the federal, or provincial governments, instead all expenditures on 
their diverse welfare activities are met from funds generated by their own 
industrial and commercial projects.
    
The affairs of FF are controlled by an administrative committee composed of 
the secretary defence as chairman with four senior officers of the army and 
one each from navy and air force. They are ex-officio members of the 
committee.
    
The executive body responsible for the efficient functioning of all the 
industrial and welfare projects being run by the FF is a board of directors 
which comprises six directors headed by a managing director.
    
The FF is run almost entirely by ex-service personnel. The chief executive 
is traditionally a senior retired army officer of the rank of Lt. General 
or Maj. General, appointed by the prime minister and nominated by the army 
chief.
    
While the armys control of FF is indirect, the military directly controls 
the other three foundations with the ministry of defence having no hand in 
it. 
   
The AWT is controlled by a committee which is headed by the armys adjutant 
general and has the armys three principal staff officers as members. It 
was set up in 1971.
    
At present the FF fully owns 10 industrial and commercial projects and has 
shares in three other projects.
   
These include three sugar mills and one of the largest fertilizer plants in 
Asia which gives it a near monopoly in urea in Pakistan.
    
It also makes breakfast cereals, jellies and custard powder and also runs 
natural gas fields and a host of other small companies. 
   
It employs nearly 10,000 people full-time and several thousand others as 
casual employees in sugar mills during the season.
    
The Foundation runs 12 hospitals, 24 day health centres, 2 wards, 21 
dispensaries, 46 mobile dispensaries, 2 mobile units, one artifical limbs 
centre, one nursing school, one college each for boys and girls, 64 model 
schools, one technical library, 4 leadership training projects, 9 technical 
training centres, 66 vocational training centres, one institute of computer 
sciences, one overseas employement service and a security service.
    
The groups sales for 1994/95 was over Rs 3.5 billion. The net worth of the 
organisation in that year was nearly Rs 5.5 billion and its total assets 
were nearly Rs 8 billion.
    
>From inception till September 30, 1995, the FF has spent nearly Rs 5.5 
billion on its various welfare measures for ex- servicemen and their 
dependents.
    
Welfare expenditure in 1992/93 was 87 per cent of its profits, the next 
year it was 80 per cent and in the following two years 83 and 80 per cent 
respectively.
    
Being run by charitable organisations, all the commercial enterprises fully 
owned by FF, AWT, BF and SB do not pay corporate taxes and income taxes, 
although all of them pay sales tax and Iqra tax. Listed companies with 
outside shareholders, however, are subject to all the normal tax laws.
    
The AWT runs seven industrial projects, five large agricultural farms, five 
travel agencies, one restaurant and has invested heavily in real estate. 
   
These include a giant sugar mill, two cement factories, one pharmaceutial 
unit, a rice mill and a plant making vegetable oil. It has its own 
commercial bank and a commercial insurance company.
    
The Shaheen Foundation is much smaller in comparison. It employs about 
1,000 people overall and has assets worth nearly a billion rupees. It runs 
an advertising agency, a knitwear manufacturing plant, computer 
organisation, and has about 25 per cent share in Shaheen-Cable TV. 
   
It also owns some smaller companies including a duty-free shop. Shaheen 
also owns Karachis poshest office block, the Shaheen Complex, which hosts 
among others the local branches of the Bank of Yokyo, American Express and 
the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank.
    
Apart from AWT, the army runs a giant armament manufacturing industrial 
complex at Wah. This complex manufactures small arms, all types of 
ordinance as well as armoured vehicles including the countrys first 
indigenously built main battle tank, the Al-Khalid.
    
These factories export nearly $50 million worth of weapons annually. These 
industries are, however, not run on the lines of AWT and are mainly 
strategic to reduce the dependency on overseas suppliers. The Wah factories 
are always headed by a serving general.
    
No military commercial establishment has been known to have defaulted on 
loans so far. But credits and loans come easily to these enterprises 
because in Pakistan, all kinds of doors open for the uniformed without even 
knocking.
    
It is natural that the military would be able to do business in a country 
that has been ruled more often by generals than civilians. In the years of 
martial law, the military and the entrenched civilian bureaucracy which are 
the ruling elite and have a symbiotic relationship helped these businesses 
to grow and may have crowded out private entrepreneurs. 
   
But it is also a fact, that a disciplined work force and good 
administration has made these units profitable concerns. 
    
They compete in the open market with better products. In fact some of the 
products coming out of military units are considered the best in the 
country.

<a name="para">Paradox of education and development in Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Mahnaz Fatima

INVESTMENT in human capital is now recognised as a factor that has 
contributed significantly to economic growth and development in all 
developed or rapidly developing parts of the world.
    
Needless to stress when we talk about economic development, we have growth 
with equity and social justice in mind. In addition, to the health and 
physical condition of the human resources and the environment in which they 
are brought up, education is a component that has always been regarded as 
critical to human resource development.
    
The level and nature of education and training that is required to give a 
certain economic direction to a people, however, has now become a moot 
point. For reasons of space, I will be focusing here only on the level of 
education. Yet another controversy revolves around the role of the public 
and the private sectors in imparting education that I will touch upon.
    
Earlier, the emphasis used to be on giving as high a level of education and 
professional training as possible. For, the assumption was that rapid 
economic growth and development necessitated inputs from professionally 
qualified and university graduates. Also, since the state was considered 
responsible for the provision of health, education, and infrastructural 
facilities, government-subsidised educational facilities were made 
available liberally up to the tertiary level of education.
    
In fact, until the mid-80s, it was the public sector that dominated the 
tertiary level of education. At the primary and secondary levels, however, 
schools proliferated in both the public and private sectors with a higher 
fee structure prevailing in the private sector schools.
    
Consequently, the private sector schools were able to attract better 
qualified teachers and were also better equipped administratively to impart 
quality education. However, prior to the above-mentioned period, the fee 
structure of private schools was still affordable by a large number of 
middle-class and even some lower-middle class population segments of the 
country. The lowest income groups had to rely mainly on government schools.
    
The upshot was that only the brightest with the highest IQs from the 
government schools could compete with private school graduates for 
admissions at the tertiary level of education. And, even the average IQs 
from the relatively upper income groups could make it to the tertiary level 
and better remunerating jobs by virtue of the better educational process 
that they could buy in the market place.
    
At the same time, average students from government schools either dropped 
out or could only be absorbed in those fields of tertiary education which 
did not enjoy a high enough demand in the job market. Consequently, the 
educational system was providing a headstart to those born in the 
relatively more well- off segments of society who could access better 
private sector primary/secondary education and then state-subsidised 
tertiary education for placement in more lucrative jobs.
    
The educational system, despite a significant role of the state, was thus 
contributing to a development of dualism in the society. So, subsidisation 
of the tertiary education of students mainly from relatively upper income 
groups appeared an anomaly and rightfully so.
    
A parallel development was that the quality of tertiary education 
deteriorated as professional and liberal arts universities failed to 
attract their best and brightest graduates for teaching purposes who were 
rapidly absorbed in better paying jobs in the corporate sector.
    
A case for the enhancement of fees at the university level was thus taking 
shape and more so in view of the fact that the government, due to a paucity 
of resources, was unable to increase education funding significantly.
    
In the three decades after independence, the countrys economy ought to 
have developed enough to not only service its debt obligations to foreign 
financiers but to also fulfil a major portion of its project financing 
needs itself.
    
As our foreign economic dependence increased with the aging of the country, 
when the reverse should have been the case, we came under greater 
domination of foreign funding agencies such as the ubiquitous World Bank 
and the IMF.
    
The World Bank in particular, with its policy making and implementation 
wings charged with the thinking of the neo- classical counter-revolution 
that occurred in the west in late- 70s and early-80s, played a significant 
role in the further introduction of the market- and price-mechanism in the 
sector of education as well.
    
Users must pay was the slogan. The case for fee enhancement at the public 
sector university level was thus given further impetus and directions. And, 
users of education were expected to pay in proportion to the quality they 
received. So, a case was also made for universities in the private sector, 
giving quality education no doubt, but charging exorbitant fees that only 
the upper-middle income or upper income groups could afford.
    
So, while groundwork for internationally competitive tertiary education was 
laid within the country which is indeed commendable as it would serve to 
set standards of higher education in the country providing a pull-effect on 
the rest; the downside was that seeds were sown for making an already 
growing dualistic societal structure even more dualistic.
    
This tendency, if it proliferates, will only serve to widen and deepen 
class cleavages by providing a headstart to those from the most affluent 
segments of society. Another danger is that the research and publication 
agendas might be controlled to suit upper-class and foreign interests.
    
The two tendencies will lead to the reinforcement of a ruling class tied to 
the west, as that is where the major sources of funding of these high class 
private sector universities are centred, which might just end up promoting 
even more of foreign interest than Pakistans.
    
However, the majority of the population and brains can then expect to 
remain subservient to this class of educated elites in a country that can 
only be described as territorially independent, at best. I will revert to 
the dilemma of tertiary education in Pakistan later.
    
Arguments in favour of abdication of state responsibility at the tertiary 
level education also emanate from yet another source in economic thought 
which is indeed paradoxical when applied to the ground reality in Pakistan.
    
This tendency, in addition to having the World Banks support, received 
further support from the directions in the literature of development 
economies (DE).
    
The DE literature made a case for shifting government resources away from 
tertiary level education to primary education for it is primary level 
education that tends to be more redistributive in nature than the tertiary 
level.
    
This thinking was internalised by policy makers especially in the light of 
the tertiary level education scenario painted above. And, this case became 
stronger for application in Pakistan in the light of a third parallel 
development in the country when it failed to develop at a rapid enough pace 
to absorb the tertiary level graduates.
    
The situation deteriorated to the extent that the job markets for even 
medical doctors and engineers became virtually saturated. The 
professionally qualified tertiary level graduates were thus not being able 
to feed their expertise into an economic cycle that was beginning to 
stagnate.
    
One would then like to know if the problem is with the tertiary level 
education or economic mismanagement of the country. And, whether the 
emphasis should be on clipping the tertiary level education or on rapid 
economic growth and development in the formal sector.
    
However, the prescription from the DE literature would recommend shifting 
government funds to primary level education instead and making tertiary 
level education available to only those who could afford it.
    
If this is allowed in the case of Pakistan, then as argued above, it will 
lead to even more dualism. Further, state emphasis on only primary 
education can bring us to a similar dead end unless the formal legal 
economy grows fast enough to absorb the primary graduates in the formal 
urban sector. Otherwise, we will just be creating an urban underclass that 
will serve as a source of cheap labour and products for an urban upper 
class thriving more on a booming informal black economy rather than a legal 
formal economy.

In the rural sector, primary education will serve to contribute 
productively and equitably once the conventional strongholds of power are 
broken, otherwise we will be providing cheap and better quality labour to 
the traditional structures of economic and political power in the 
countryside that might just end up strengthening them further.
    
The DE emphasis on primary education, if adopted in isolation, is a 
paternalistic solution to the economic problems of LDCs unless the formal 
economy grows and develops with equitable distribution of political and 
social power too. And, this is where the twain meet.
    
That is, this is precisely where the approaches of the World Bank and the 
DE prescriptions converge. As the DE approach helps in taking care of 
poverty somewhat through primary education emphasis, the World Bank is 
happy to see solutions to some poverty eradication with the structures of 
power remaining intact for these power structures provide effective 
linkages to the promotion of foreign economic and political interests.
    
The emphasis should, therefore, be on the growth of the formal economy and 
restructuring power relationships in the country which will then be able to 
make use of all levels of education. And, in this respect, the role of the 
government is far from over.
    
However, despite shifting state emphasis towards primary education in 
theory, the price-mechanism in Pakistan seems to be operating at this level 
too and much more vigorously than ever before since the late General Zia 
attempted to restrict the medium of instruction at the primary/secondary 
levels.
    
Even primary/secondary education of a quality that would propel students 
into better paying jobs is thus becoming more of a preserve of a narrow 
middle- and mainly upper-middle classes because of exorbitantly high fees.
    
Here, there is a need for regulation of the fee structures that should be 
charged after allowing a reasonable margin on costs. Otherwise, it will 
lead to even more dualism. And, education will become an even more sought-
after means of wealth accumulation as is being done by private school 
owners.
    
Also, there is a need to arrest the tendency towards restricting tertiary 
level education to a select upper segment of the society through the price-
mechanism.
    
For, the benefits of tertiary education should diffuse through all segments 
of the society if economic growth of the formal sector is to be attained 
with equity and social justice. However, the dilemma of providing quality 
tertiary education in the public sector remains.
    
The public sector universities are seized with the problems of sub-standard 
teaching and research and are not being able to fulfil the objectives of 
knowledge accumulation and dissemination satisfactorily which should be 
their reason for being. In some professional universities, the high-calibre 
of graduates is more a function of the high level of entrance standard that 
they are able to maintain because of a higher derived demand for their 
degrees rather than value addition within the university itself.
    
One of the constraints could be financial resource generation and 
allocation problems. The resource generation constraint, if solved, through 
across-the-board fee increases would serve to restrict education to a 
select group as argued above.
    
Alternatives could be sought by developing a fee structure (two/three 
slabs) that would be a function of the financial background of the students 
selected only on the basis of merit.
    
Fee-discrimination, as also practised in the health sector by some, would 
not only tend to be redistributive but would also help elevate the 
prevailing academic standards of teaching and research through revenue 
contribution.
    
Universities might also solicit funds from big business and industrial 
groups with a sense of responsibility towards the society with a view to 
developing a public-private sector partnership in tertiary education. Such 
a partnership could go a long way in solving the twin problems of quality 
and financial resource constraints that the public sector universities are 
gripped with.
    
Inputs from the private sector can also help public sector universities 
make better resource allocation decisions for research and teaching with a 
view to improving their intensity and quality especially where they have 
been guided by operating philosophies that have failed to improve upon the 
same thus far.
    
At the same time, public sector participation will enable such universities 
to retain freedom in setting academic agendas and making tertiary education 
accessible to as wide a segment of the population as is possible by 
moderating the private sector tendency to make quick commercial gains.
    
Towards this goal, the end of this article serves to provide some initial 
thoughts only in the hope that it might lead to more constructive thinking 
and solutions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, April 28: Stocks on Monday failed to extend the weekend rally as 
investors moved in to take profits at the available margins but the selling 
was largely prompted by technical factors. The squaring of positions was 
said to be the chief inspiring force behind the sell-off but it was well-
absorbed at the dips, dealers said.
    
However, there were no signs of a sustained recovery as both foreign 
investors and local institutional traders were not inclined to hold long 
positions apparently fearing further devaluation of the rupee any time. 
The near-term share market outlook appears to be uncertain as investors 
are not inclined to make bigger commitments even at the current lower 
levels, some analysts said.
    
They said the chief negative factors behind the current sluggishness and 
volatile performance of the market appeared to be inconsistency in foreign 
fund buying and until they made bigger showing there was no possibility of 
a sustained run-up. The local leading institutional traders are terribly 
short of liquid funds owing to various factors including expensive bank 
credits and their absence from the rings has driven away jobbers and short-
term dealers out of the market at least for the near-term, they added.
    
Thus, there is not a single factor but a combination of them, which are 
working against the underlying sentiment, some dealers said and added is 
it not horrible state of affairs that investors are not inclined to trade 
beyond half a dozen current favourites?
    
The 100-share index early was down by 10 points but mid-session speculative 
buying on selected counters enabled it to recoup in part early losses. It 
was last quoted at 1,533.02 as compared to 1,537.51 at the last weekend, 
showing a modest decline of 4.49 points.
    
Instances of strong selective buying were not lacking but the broader 
market performed terribly bad as all the index shares received fresh heavy 
battering. Losers, therefore, held a strong lead over the gainers at 192 to 
61, with 55 shares holding on the last levels.
    
Volume also fell to 33 million shares from the last weekends 42 million 
shares as general investors kept to the sidelines awaiting apparently the 
advent of the new account.
    
Bulk of the selling was centred around the current favourites, notably the 
PTC vouchers, which was massively traded either-way but finally finished 
reacted by 85 paisa on a volume of 16 million shares, about a half of the 
total. News that its GDR rates on the London Stock market is terribly weak 
on persistent selling was said to be the chief destabilizing factor behind 
the local selling and lack of foreign fund buying. It could be a good-buy 
slightly below Rs 23 and wait till that level is reached, brokerage houses 
are telling to buyers.
    
Analysts said the near-term outlook for the market appeared to be a bit 
bearish as investors were not coming in for various reasons including weak 
economy, falling exports and fears of decline in industrial productivity. 
But the markets chief worry appears to be strong rumours of fresh 
devaluation of the rupee and until that happens, foreign investors might 
stay out,they added.
    
Although minus signs dominated the list, all was not bad with the broader 
market as some mega issues managed to put on fresh good gains under the 
lead of PSO, which as quoted above Rs 300 on heavy buying triggered by the 
news that the government might not disinvest its shares to the private 
sector or any foreign investors. It rose by Rs 10 amid active trading.
    
Some of the MNCs followed it, finishing with an extended rally on active 
short-covering at the lower levels. Shell Pakistan, Dawood Hercules, Engro 
Chemical, Reckitt & Colman, Nestlepak and Lever Brothers were leading among 
them.
    
Leading pharma shares, however, remained under pressure and ended further 
lower under the lead of Knoll, Parke-Davis, and SK&F and so were Burshane 
Pakistan and Siemens. Insurance shares, notably Muslim and Dadabhoy 
Insurance were top losers among the locals.
    
Apart from PTC vouchers, the most active list was topped by ICI Pakistan, 
off 35 paisa on 7.372m shares, followed by Hub-Power, lower 55 paisa on 
4.675m shares, Dewan Salman, off 90 paisa on 1.817m shares and Platinum 
Bank, up 75 paisa on 0.501m shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by D.G.Khan Cement, lower 30 paisa on 
0.309m shares and FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, easy 30 paisa on 0.129m shares. 
There were some other notable deals also.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

EVERY institution of this country has been well and truly mutilated, 
subverted, or snuffed out. Can we not at least start cleaning up and curing 
those institutions that educate and heal?
    
Willy-nilly, whether they be discredited politicians, seat-warmers, 
favoured friends, army generals, strongmen or shrinking violets, our 
governors are the chancellors of the universities of their provinces. They 
dole out honorary doctorates to undeserving friends, and preside over the 
ceremonies looking highly incongruous in gilded gowns and their 
predecessors mortar boards. On the whole they are ineffective and do 
little good.
    
The one right thing done by Chancellor Kamal Azfar was to appoint, entirely 
on merit, Engineer Abul Kalam, as vice-chancellor of the Nadirshaw Eduljee 
Dinshaw University of Engineering and Technology. On taking over in 
December 1996, Kalam found on his table the case of 64 students who had 
been fraudulently passed. He asked the chancellor to hold an enquiry. The 
chancellor then did wrong in appointing me, a member of the NED Syndicate, 
to inquire into the affair, later compounding it by having a message passed 
to Kalam via another member of the Syndicate asking him to pour water over 
the findings, whatever they be.
    
The Affair of the 64 Students:
 
First attempt: Sixty four third-year civil engineering students were 
examined for the first time on the subject of Theory of structure on May 
2, 1994. The papers were sent to an external examiner (a non-university 
man) who marked them all at zero. On their return, the papers were then 
sent, as is usual, to be marked by an internal examiner (an NED associate 
professor of the civil engineering department) who too marked them all at 
zero. Both examiners were satisfied by the answers given that the students 
had all obviously cheated.
    
Second attempt: The 64 students were allowed to appear for the second time 
on October 5, 1995. The same external examiner again gave them zero, as did 
the same internal examiner.
    
Third attempt: They were allowed to appear for the third time on June 16, 
1996, the same external examiner once more marking them all at zero, whilst 
the same internal examiner, the NED associate professor, gave to each of 
them 24 marks, though failing them as the pass mark is 40.
    
Fourth attempt: The results of the third attempt were to be announced on 
December 12, 1996. Long before, the 64 found out that they had failed and 
were allowed to retake the examination for the fourth time on September 16, 
1996. They sat, along with 85 other regular students. The university, 
however, appointed specially chosen external and internal examiners to 
mark the papers of the to be passed 64. The external was a KDA man, and 
the internal an NED man not specialised in the Theory of structure. 
Hurrah, Hurrah, all 64 were passed by both examiners!
    
Exercising abundant caution, I asked the VC to have the papers of the 64 
examined afresh by an independent reputable external examiner. This was 
done, and he failed the lot.
    
What is there to enquire about? I asked Kalam. Who are the men involved? 
With whose connivance was the passing of the 64 accomplished? Who aided and 
abetted whom in this crime? Make a list of the guilty and sack the lot.
    
The list of aiders and abetters included (1) the previous vice chancellor 
of the NED, (2) the professor chairman of the civil engineering department, 
(3) the associate professor of the same department who as internal examiner 
marked the papers on the first three attempts, (4) the acting controller of 
examinations, (5) the registrar of the university, (6) the specially 
appointed KDA external examiner who passed them on the fourth attempt, (7) 
the special internal examiner who passed them on the fourth attempt.
    
Sack the lot, I said again, and ask KDA to sack their man. Kalam, being a 
dyed-in-the-wool former bureaucrat, a high railway man used to travelling 
on tracks, told me he would have to follow the rules of procedure, fully 
question each man involved, issue show cause notices, submit his report 
to the chancellor, etc.  in other words, follow the drill.
    
My report was duly sent to Chancellor Azfar, who directed that appropriate 
action be taken only against (3) downwards. The VC said no, he could not 
take action against the underlings without any action being taken against 
(1) and (2), the overlords.
    
Kalams predecessor in the NED, number one man on the list, had been 
upgraded prior to Kalams appointment and made vice chancellor of Nawabshah 
University. Number two man, the professor, resigned his chairmanship, but 
had second thoughts and is now canvassing for reinstatement. Meantime, he 
has also been elected a member of the Syndicate, Until these first two on 
the list are punished, those lower down cannot be touched, so they remain 
where they were.
    
One of the 64 students was wrongfully issued a pass certificate before 
Kalams arrival which he has cancelled, and he has refused to issue 
certificates to the other 63.
    
Now, the chancellor is our new governor, Lt. General Moinuddin Haider, 
reputed to be a strong man. He is pondering over the matter.
    
*From an educational hazard we now move to a health hazard.
    
In 1992, the then Professor of ENT at the Dow Medical College attached to 
the Civil Hospital, Karachi, (now retired) acting as the dean of the 
Faculty of Medicine of the University of Karachi, gave a certificate to a 
doctor, an MD, working as associate professor of medicine in the Jinnah 
Postgraduate Medical Centre, incorrectly certifying that she has passed MD 
Medicine with special subject Nephrology held in January 1992. She will be 
issued certificate in due course of time.
    
On June 4, 1994, this doctor, a member of a powerful bureaucratic family, 
who already had been promoted over the heads of others better qualified, 
apparently misrepresenting facts, wrote to the joint secretary 
(administration), ministry of health, Islamabad, claiming I am duly 
qualified in this speciality having done MD (Medicine) with specialisation 
in Nephrology... She applied for promotion to the post of Professor of 
Nephrology, being the only senior departmental candidate possessing the 
postgraduate major qualification in Nephrology and teaching experience in 
the field.
    
The well-connected applicant was again promoted, disregarding seniority, to 
head the Department of Nephrology, with the rank and status of a full-
fledged professor.
    
On March 21, 1995, she wrote to Karachi University, sending the ENT 
professors letter and asking that a certificate be issued to her 
certifying that she is an MD in Nephrology. The registrar wrote back on 
March 28: ...The letter issued by the ex-Dean of Medicine... has no legal 
effect. The dean has no authority to issue such a letter without the prior 
approval of the Board of Advanced Studies, the Academic Council, and the 
Syndicate. Your application for issuance of MD Degree in Nephrology is 
being rejected for the following reasons. Five reasons were given.
    
With no postgraduate degree in Nephrology, in a postgraduate medical centre 
the professor continues to treat kidney ailments, and inadequately tries to 
teach the few students desperate to learn.
    
The new secretary of the ministry of health has just awoken and sent the 
doctor a show-cause notice charging her with misrepresenting facts, holding 
her prima facie guilty of misconduct and asking why, under the rules, she 
should not be dismissed from service. Better late than never. But who is 
responsible for the damage that may have been done to her patients through 
her lack of qualifications and experience, and the damage to the careers of 
those over whose heads she has leap-frogged?
    
Fraud is not a rare case in the JPMC. There now is a man who treats the 
mentally ill. He went to the Free University of Berlin, stayed there for 
three years, had no clinical training, no patient contact, wrote a research 
paper on the subject of heroin addiction and AIDS, and obtained a research 
degree in 1988. On his return to Pakistan, he presented to the Pakistan 
Medical and Dental Council inaccurate translations of the German degrees 
awarded to him claiming qualifications that he did not have. The PMDC in 
their wisdom awarded him what they termed to be an equivalent degree  FCPS 
in Psychiatry, terming it the highest possible qualification in psychiatry.
    
The German consulate in 1993, had this to say about the translation of the 
degree certificate: Apparently a certification given by this Consulate on 
August 21, 1989, that the translation of said document conferring the 
doctoral degree is true and correct has been given without proper 
checking of all details.
    
This man, with his knowledge of heroin addiction and AIDS, has for years 
been in charge of curing the mentally ill at the JPMC and of training 
students of psychiatry. Complaints have been forwarded to the prime 
minister and to others, but so far no one is bothered.
    
The education and health of the awam, literate or illiterate, sick or well, 
count for nothing. The government, supposedly elected by the poor, seems 
least concerned. According to the latest UNDP report, Pakistans literacy 
rate is the sixth lowest in the world. Below us rank only Nepal, 
Afghanistan, Somalia, Niger and Barkina Faso. To pull us out of this dismal 
position all we need is 200 good men, appointed on merit alone, to head our 
educational and health institutions.

<a name="eidm">Eid mubarak</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Kureishi

A FUNNY thing happened to a friend of mine on the eve of the Eid holidays, 
four in all if Sunday is included. Actually my friend did not see the funny 
side of it at all. He found that his telephone had mysteriously gone dead. 
He complained, as any law abiding citizen would do, and he was given a 
complaint number 73.
    
Predictably nothing happened, so he complained the following morning again. 
This time he was given complaint number 103 and this struck him as odd. He 
was making progress in the reverse direction. He was told also that nothing 
could be done till after Eid. Thus he was stuck without a telephone for 
four days.
    
On Eid day a linesman showed up, waving a piece of paper and said that he 
has come to fix the phone. He pottered around, stretched a few wires and 
blew into the phone and declared that the phone was now working. He said 
that it was an instrument fault. My friend paid him Rs 100 which he 
considered insufficient but took it all the same. Was there a genuine 
fault? It could well be. My friend is prepared to give the benefit of the 
doubt. But he found it exceedingly suspicious that there should be a 
linesman who was so conscientious that he was prepared to work on Eid day. 
It is entirely possible that there are people like that, the salt of the 
earth.
    
The approach of Eid is also a dangerous time for motorists. There is 
something about the holidays that bring out the civic best in our traffic 
police. They become extra vigilant and even the tiniest infraction of the 
law will be noted and the threat of a fine along with the hassle of having 
your car papers and driving licence impounded, should, in theory be a 
formidable deterrent for those who are inclined to be cavalier about 
traffic rules. But it can sometimes happen that this extra vigilance can 
result in a motorist being hauled up when, in fact, he has violated no 
rules. Although this is a daily occurance, it seems to intensify with the 
approach of Eid. It then becomes a subject of negotiation. The negotiations 
tend to be one-sided because you find yourself in an either-or bind. A 
challan or an out-of-court settlement.  Then there is the postman. One 
discovers that a few days before Eid, the postman does not ring, leave 
alone twice, not even once. It is, as if, all postal mail has dried up. 
Then on Eid day the postman arrives like Santa Claus, with a backlog of 
your mail. The postman is usually a cheerful chap and there is no menace in 
his demands. The menace is implicit as my late brother Sattoo discovered 
when he gave the postman short shrift. He stopped receiving any mail and 
when he made inquiries, he found that his letters had been piled up in the 
posts office but there was no one to deliver them. He bought his peace with 
the postman.
    
There is nothing new in this and this has been going on for years. I even 
remember this practice in pre-independence India but the situation then was 
worse for added to Eid was also Christmas and Diwali.
    
Does this constitute corruption? Strictly speaking if one was an inveterate 
nit-picker, it would. But no one really considers it in that murky light. 
It is a form of a mandatory baksheesh though the consequences of not 
coughing up can be extremely inconvenient. There is, therefore, an element 
of coercion but it is a sort of benign coercion. But whereas it cannot be 
eliminated, it would be next to impossible to do so, this sort of shake-
down has a snowballing effect. Whether corruption should be tackled, with 
the full majesty of self-righteousness, at this level is a different 
matter. Personally I would be against it because it would divert attention 
from the main thrust of accountability. But what has happened is that this 
bakhsheesh has become a matter of right, like over-time in the big 
corporations and companies. Whether anyone actually puts in overtime, it is 
claimed all the same and has become an integral part of the pay packet.
    
If this level of corruption is seen as bakhseesh, the mega-deals involving 
really big bucks is seen as high finance. What we consider to be corruption 
is something in the middle. Which is why the big fish are not caught and we 
tend to focus our attention on middling officials who are neither fish nor 
fowl but make jolly good red herrings. That is why one feels that those who 
are responsible for the atta crisis will go scot-free but some lower order 
functionaries will be nabbed. If I was giving advice to a young man or 
woman on the threshold of a career, I would suggest that they aim for the 
top slot or a slot pretty low in the rung. Its the in-betweens that get 
washed up in the tide.
    
While Im on the subject of Eid, I must make mention of the awful tragedy 
at Mina. Ones heart goes out to the families of those who lost loved ones. 
Haj is a massive operation and there can be accidents. But this does not 
mitigate the grief. It should be possible to tighten safety standards and 
there could be some kind of orientation of intending pilgrims, some 
elementary dos and donts. The Mina tragedy took some of the gloss out of 
the Eid celebrations. But thats not the only reason for a muted Eid. There 
was the atta crisis. Each year one finds that it is costlier to celebrate 
Eid. There is, unfortunately, no signs that there will be any let-up in the 
cost of living. It should really be called the cost of subsistence.

<a name="cele">Celebrating the Golden Jubilee</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
M.H. Askari

IN the general excitement of the celebration of the fifty years of 
Pakistan, the fact that the year 1997 also marks the golden jubilee of the 
end of the British Raj in the subcontinent appears to have been relegated 
to the background. In the various programmes drawn up to mark the fiftieth 
anniversary of the birth of Pakistan, the emphasis seems to be on the fact 
of partition rather than on the end of foreign domination  an event that 
deserves to be celebrated with an equal if not perhaps, greater fervour.
    
If the establishment of Pakistan on August 14, 1947 was the glorious 
culmination point of the long struggle of the Muslims to establish their 
identity as a separate nation, the struggle itself grew out of the larger 
freedom movement, to which the Muslims of the subcontinent contributed 
quite as much as the other communities. Indeed, liberation from foreign 
domination was of special significance for the Muslims as it was with the 
dethronement of the last Moghul Emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, that the 
British succeeded in bringing the subcontinent under their colonial rule.
    
Although the process of disintegration of the Moghul empire had started 
more than a century earlier, it was in 1857 that it met its formal demise. 
This did not happen without a full-fledged revolt against the British in 
which practically all sections of the society participated. The revolt was 
suppressed with great ruthlessness and with Bahadur Shah Zafar and his 
progeny being made prisoner and remorselessly persecuted. However, even 
after the revolt was put down, the spirit behind it was never extinguished. 
On the contrary, it continued to manifest itself in various forms with 
greater or lesser intensity until 1947, when the British found themselves 
confronted with no option but to withdraw. The creation of Pakistan in 1947 
was the result of a chain of events that was set into motion with the 
revolt in 1857.
    
Even though the Muslim leadership was prominent in the overall freedom 
struggle from the outset, there is a tendency in Pakistan to look upon it 
somewhat apologetically since the Congress played a dominant role in it. 
The fact that for quite some time the Congress and the Muslim League 
pursued their political objectives concurrently, almost as part of the same 
mainstream, is often played down. It is also frequently not realised that 
what eventually concertised in the end of the British Raj may not have at 
all come about without the militant nature of some of the earliest 
revolutionary movements launched by prominent Muslim religious leaders and 
intellectuals. It was Saiyyid Ahmad Barelwi under whose leadership a jihad 
was launched against the Sikh conquest of the Punjab and the Frontier 
towards the latter part of the eighteenth century, and it was Shah Abdul 
Aziz, the son of the great scholar Shah Waliullah, who about the same 
period issued the fatwa that with the ascent of the British, India had come 
under Christian domination and was virtually dar-ul-harb.
    
The origin of the two-nation theory is often traced to Sir Saiyyid (1817-
98) who emerged as the leading Muslim reformer and thinker after the revolt 
of 1857 and who launched a crusade not only to salvage Muslims from their 
strong sense of defeatism after the loss of the Moghul empire but also 
against the religious obscurantists who were beginning to gain the 
leadership of the Muslims. Prof Khalid Bin Sayeed strongly disputes that 
Sir Saiyyid, even though he counselled Muslims against joining the Indian 
National Congress should be regarded as anti-Hindu. He quotes Sir Saiyyid 
as describing India as a beautiful bride whose two eyes were Hindu and 
Muslim but also points out that Sir Saiyyid stressed that the beauty of 
India depended upon the fact that the two eyes shone with equal lustre. 
However, Sir Saiyyid was opposed to wholesale extension of representative 
government to India as he believed that majority government was possible in 
a society where the voters belonged to a homogeneous nation.
    
It is not without significance that when the Muslims came increasingly 
under the influence of Western education and culture, the educated Muslim 
elite felt that Hindus and Muslims should get together to evolve a common 
nationality and serve their country by awakening public opinion in favour 
of political reforms. Prof Khalid Bin Sayeed recalls that the Quaid-i-Azam 
began his political career with such ideals, and believes that the liberal 
sections of the Muslim League, led by the Quaid-i-Azam, succeeded in 
persuading both the Congress and the Muslim League to hold their annual 
sessions in Bombay in 1915. Again, in 1916 the two parties held their 
annual sessions in Lucknow. presiding over the League session, Quaid-i-Azam 
expressed the view that towards the Hindus our attitude should be of 
goodwill and brotherly feelings (and) cooperation in the cause of our 
motherland should be our guiding principle. He also brought about what 
came to be known as the Lucknow Pact through which the Congress conceded 
the principle of separate electorates to the Muslims and in return the 
Muslims were guaranteed a share of seats in all provinces. However, it was 
the infamous Nehru Report dealing with the communal problem which marked 
the beginning of the divergence in the politics of Muslims and Hindus.
    
It is relevant to recall that Muslims took a leading part in several of the 
revolutionary movements which were launched during the freedom struggle. 
The Ghadar Party was part of the revolutionary movements. Prominent among 
its leaders were Shaikh-ul-Hind, Maulana Mahmud Hasan, Maulvi Obaidullah 
Sindhi, Maulvi Barkatullah, Maulana Hussain Ahmad Madni. During World War 
I, a provisional government of (free) India was established in Kabul 
which included Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi and Maulana Barkatullah, among 
others. The provisional government sent missions to Russia, Turkey and 
Japan for soliciting their aid in liberating India. Efforts were also made 
to raise troops which included, among others, a large number of Punjabi 
young men who had migrated to Kabul under the hijrat movement. Maulana 
Obaidullah Sindhi was a witness to three revolutions  one in Kabul, 
another in Russia and a third in Turkey.
    
In his Our Freedom Fighters (first published in 1969), G. Allana has given 
a graphic account of his meetings with Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi in Karachi 
in the early forties. He recalls that the Maulana was a revolutionary whom 
Jawaharlal Nehru had praised in his autobiography.

Allana says that the Maulana Sahib made no secret of his dis-agreement with 
Gandhiji on many issues of fundamental importance, and quotes him as having 
said: Gandhiji wrongly believes that he can take India back thousands of 
years. He forgets that there lives in India another nation, with another 
language, a new culture, a new way of thinking and this nation has as much 
right in India as Gandhiji has... Allana also says that Maulana Obaidullah 
had started a new political party known as Jumna, Narbada, Sindh, Sagar 
Party with its offices in Karachi, Lahore and Delhi. The aim of his party 
was that India should not be considered as one country, but, like Europe, 
it should be divided on linguistic and cultural lines.
    
Fifty years after the end of the British Raj, it seems important to 
remember that in the struggle for independence the people who now belong to 
three separate countries, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, were inspired by 
one and the same motivating ideal  freedom. A befitting way to commemorate 
the momentous struggle would perhaps be by having at least one joint 
programme for celebrating the golden jubilee.

<a name="saee">Saeed Anwar comes back for Indian tour</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, May 2: The experienced Test opener Ramiz Raja  has been retained as 
captain, the dashing left-hand opener Saeed Anwar (making a comeback after 
regaining fitness and missing Sharjah Cup and the tour of Sri Lanka) as 
vice-captain and the former Test all-rounder Nasim-ul-Ghani as tour manager 
of the Pakistan cricket team named for the Independence Cup Cricket 
Tournament to be held in India from May 9 to .
     
The 14 cricketers picked for the team include young middle-order batsman 
Hasan Raza, who made history by playing his first Test at the youngest age 
(eclipsing Mushtaq Muhammads record), Lahores young international paceman 
Abdul Razzaq and the Test left-arm spinner Muhammad Hussain. The last-
mentioned two players had been sent to Sri Lanka on a request from the tour 
management to substitute the injured world-class speed-merchants Wasim 
Akram and Waqar Younis but could not get a chance to play in the second 
Test at Kandy.
     
The experienced Test fast-medium bowler Aaqib Javed, who has always bowled 
splendidly in one-day internationals, but had fallen favour of the 
selectors, has also been recalled along with the dashing young all-rounder 
Shahid Afridi. In fact, both Aaqib Javed and Shahid Afridi forced their way 
into the team by exhibiting flabbergasting form and fitness while grabbing 
the first International Floodlit Double Wicket Cricket Championship at the 
Qadhafi Stadium on April 25, beating all the foreign pairs fairly and 
squarely.   Along with Nasim-ul-Ghani as the tour manager, Mushtaq Muhammad 
has been retained as the coach and Dr Dan Kiesel as the physiotherapist.
     
The Pakistan team will face stiff challenge in the forthcoming four-nation 
Independence Cup from the World Cup champion Sri Lanka side, the former 
World Cup champion and the host Indian team and the fast-improving New 
Zealand side (which had recently defeated Sri Lankans both in the Test and 
one-day international home series). The Pakistan team will also sadly miss 
the incomparable attack bowlers Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. The in-form 
toe-crusher Waqar Younis had informed about his non-availability to the 
Pakistan cricket Board (PCB) due to contractual obligation with the English 
county Glamorgan before also getting unfortunately unfit due to hairline 
fracture in his foot. The left-arm all-rounder Wasim Akram was keen to lead 
the  Pakistan team in the Independence Cup in India and had showed 
willingness to seek his release from his county Lancashire but sadly 
developed pain in his functional shoulder and had to rush to Britain from 
Sri Lanka to get himself treated and be fit before the beginning of the 
English cricket season.
     
The experienced right-arm leg-spinner Mushtaq Ahmad will also be sorely 
missed as he could have proved effective on the turning pitches of India. 
The PCB secretary Waqar Ahmad told this reporter on Friday afternoon that 
Mushtaq Ahmad had recovered from the knee-trouble he recurred in Sri Lanka 
but informed that his county Somerset was not willing to release him  even 
temporarily.
     
Batting seems to be a strong point of the Pakistan team and could prove 
match-winning during the Independence Cup. Besides the experienced captain 
Ramiz Raja, the Pakistani batting has been re-furbished by the comeback of 
the reliable left-hand opener Saeed Anwar, who had to miss the Sharjah Cup 
and tour of Sri Lanka due to sickness. It has strong middle-order in 
presence of the experienced and in-form brothers-in-law Salim Malik and 
Ejaz Ahmad Senior, youngsters Hasan Raza and Muhammad Wasim,  a far-
improved wicketkeeper/batsman Moin Khan  (now recovered from foot injury) 
and the dashing  stroke-player Inzimam-ul-Haq, who has the ability to tear 
apart any bowling on any type of pitch on his day.
     
The Pakistan team, in pace-bowling, will have to rely heavily on Aaqib 
Javed. Young Abdul Razzaq is very promising medium-pacer (having proved his 
worth in the junior series in Pakistan against England A side and in 
South Africa) and also a more-than-useful batsman. Young Azhar Mahmood, 
although has not been able to perform to his potential up till now, yet he 
is a good medium-pacer and fast-hitting batsman.

The team consists of the following:
     
Captain Ramiz Raja, vice-captain Saeed Anwar, Ejaz Ahmad Senior, Salim 
Malik, Inzimam-ul-Haq, Muhammad Wasim, Hasan Raza, Azhar Mahmood, Shahid 
Afridi, Moin Khan, Saqlain Mushtaq, Muhammad Hussain, Aaqib Javed and Abdul 
Razzaq. Tour Manager: Nasim-ul-Ghani. Cricket manager:    Mushtaq Muhammad. 
Physiotherapist: Dr Dan Kiesel.
     
Following is the full programme of the Independence Cup Cricket Tournament:
     
May 9: Pakistan vs. New Zealand at Mohali; May 12: Pakistan vs. Sri Lanka 
at Gwalior; May 14: India vs. New Zealand at Hyderabad; May 17: India vs. 
Sri Lanka at Mumbai (Bombay); May 20: Sri Lanka vs. New Zealand at 
Hyderabad; May 21: Pakistan vs. India at Chennai (Madras); May 24: First 
Final at Mohali or Chandigarh; May 27: Second Final at Eden Gardens, 
Calcutta; May 28: Third Final (if need arose) at Calcutta.

<a name="pear">Pearl Island prospers as cricket jewel</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

COLOMBO: The pearl of the Indian Ocean, as Sri Lanka is known is not much 
different from the Islands in the Paradise in the Caribbean. Except that 
the West Indies is made of many patches of land in the sea and Sri Lanka is 
just one country.
    
The similarity with the islands in the West Indies is striking. Beaches 
abound, lush green parks and the tropical jangles with its fauna and flora 
present very much the same panoramic setting.
    
Sadly however this beautiful island of nearly 18 million habitants has been 
in recent times politically disturbed particularly in the Jaffna area in 
the north of island where the Tamil separatists have been active.
    
New Zealand had to abandon their tour once midway because of a bomb 
explosion in front of their hotel in the city centre of Colombo and only 
last January when 90 people lost their lives after another bomb in the 
crowded city centre, the Australians and the West Indies refused to play 
their World Cup matches here and had to forfeit their points in the Cup 
Kenya and Zimbabwe did come and fulfill their commitments. Enthuasims has 
not diminished though.
    
Cricket like in the West Indian islands is the legacy of the British 
Colonial rule and its following as strong as the belief of the majority of 
population who worship the great Buddha. Other religions also flourish as 
much as does the game of cricket which has brought them into limelight 
after the 1996 World Cup was won by Arjuna Ranatungas team at the Gaddafi 
Stadium Lahore.
    
Fifty years ago the British declared Sri Lanka an independent state and 
left behind their much loved language and cricket behind. Not a bare patch 
of land in major cities is now without a field of cricket amongst school 
boys. The tea planters from Britain had introduced the game to the island 
and the teams from England and Australia while anchored here they played 
cricket as well to create interest.
    
First as Ceylon and later as Sri Lanka gradually earned a feather in their 
cap with Test status awarded to them after Pakistan had proposed to ICC and 
India had seconded it.
    
That they were not able to get to the top earlier was because cricket was 
not as organised as is now. The game is played since 1832 and in Colombo it 
was introduced 150 years ago by one Dr Bailey, Archdeacon of Colombo at the 
Colombo Academy which came to be known are Royal College later on.
    
His son George toured England with Australia in 1878. Many Sri Lankans 
hooked on the game on their visits to England to Oxford and Cambridge and 
played with as much fervour, the most famous being Dr Churchill Hector who 
played for Middlesex after the first war.
    
One of the countrys Prime Minister Dudley Senanayaka played for Indian 
Gymkhana at Osterley against the touring Indians in 1932 and the first 
player to earn a Blue in England was F.C.De Saram for Oxford in 1934-35 as 
did the leg spinner Gamini Goonesena who captained Cambridge and also 
visited Pakistan in early years of Pakistans coming into being.
    
Now having gained Test status in 1981, Sri Lanka is one of the most 
attractive teams around. Club cricket competitions have now become first 
class cricket and nearly 31 teams from all over the country participate for 
the Sara Cup since 1988-89 and Inter-provincial matches are played between 
provinces of which Western Province had teams like North, South and City. 
They compete for the Singer Cup.
    
Sinhalese Sports Club, Nondescript Cricket Club, Tamil Union Colombo 
Cricket Club have produce such illustrious cricketers as Dulip Mendis, 
Arjuna Ranatunga, Sidath wettimuny, the first century maker in Test for the 
country and the stalwarts of the past such as De Saram and Goonesena, all 
products of the SSc where the second Test is in progress.
    
Aravinda de Silva, Hashan Tillekeratne, Michael Tessera of old and Ranjit 
Fernando played for the Nondescript Cricket Club, another famous club of 
the country.

FOOTBALL had been the peoples game in what was previously the eastern wing 
of this country. Crowds thronged the venues to see the artistry, the foot 
wizardry and mobility of the players; quite a large number of them were 
imported from Balochistan and Sindh. As the independence heralded in 1947 
cricket had a back seat. Even in the streets and alleys of Dhaka, 
Chittagong, Mymensingh, Barisal and Faridpur the boys played and practised 
football.
    
However, from the winter of 1955 when the beautiful and spacious Dhaka 
Stadium was built and the city was included in the itinerary of the Indian 
cricketers the fans filled the galleries to show their keenness and 
interest in this new phenomenon. They applauded the ethical grandeur in the 
two half-centuries scored by Waqar Hasan and the splendour in the late cuts 
and hooks of Imtiaz Ahmad, though still not knowing the finer points of the 
game. The Dhaka onlookers, still not understanding the meaning of howzat 
enjoyed the second century in Test of Hanif Mohammad made against New 
Zealanders at a packed house in a thoroughly competent and sound mode and 
manner.
    
Bengal had struggled against the British colonialists; so the assemblage at 
the cricket stadium admired and cheered Hanifs polished century in January 
1962 against England.
    
The crowds danced with the team members when the mighty West Indies were 
brought down to earth in the second Test of the 1958-59 series.
    
In all seven Tests were staged at Dhaka, with the stadium packed like 
sardines. The matches were destined to make an impact on the general 
public, the youth especially. However, it look more than three decades for 
the enthusiasm and interest in the game to spiral when Bangladesh lifted 
its cricket from immaturity to an organised level. The country tried hard; 
they requisitioned the services of foreign coaches, Pakistanis and Indians 
in particular. Though they had fared poorly in the 1994 ICC Trophy, a 
qualification competition for the World Cup co-hosted by the South Asian 
countries, they later showed their advance by playing in the final of the 
SAARC Gold Cup against India in December of 1994 in their own capital; Sri 
Lanka and Pakistan having fallen behind the finalists because of inferior 
run-rate. There was a definite tilt towards the game; cricket had come of 
age in the country.
    
Late last year the previously minnows topped 10 regional countries to 
qualify for the Asia Cup to be held in Colombo the coming August. The world 
champions, Sri Lanka, and the two former World Cup holders, Pakistan and 
India, are among the participants in the contest.
    
The test of trial and progression for Bangladesh came in Kuala Lumpur, 
their venue of success for the ACC Trophy. The Dhaka warriors had missed 
the 1992 World Cup by the proverbial whisker when Zimbabwe pipped them in 
the final in the 1990 ICC Trophy, played in Holland.
    
Gordon Greenidge, the famed opening batsman of the West Indies, booked as a 
coach, had prepared the Bangladesh team well. But still they were not among 
the favourites. Kenya, UAE, winners of the last championship, and Holland, 
a competitor in the last World Cup, were tipped to gain the berth for the 
1999 nascent cricket extravaganza in England.
    
Holland did reach the knockout stage of the Kuala Lumpur tournament but 
Untied Arab Emirate fell by the wayside. The Dutch later had a shock defeat 
against Ireland and the ultimate winners, Bangladesh.
    
Both Kenya and the Dhaka cricketers had a spotless record in the round-
robin stage of the competition as well as in the knockout round.
    
Bangladesh opened with an emphatic victory over Argentina. Later they not 
only lowered the colours of Denmark but settled the pretensions of UAE, 
winners of last ICC Trophy, who collapsed for a paltry 95 in the 35th over. 
Bangladesh removed Holland from their way to earn a berth for the 
penultimate round of the trophy, where Scotland were no match to their 
vigour, skill and alacrity on the field. The Bangladeshis came out in 
thousands in the streets of Dhaka to celebrate their success in the semi-
final which gave them a passage to England for the next World Cup, a 
tremendous onward march from the days when their youngsters only watched 
the game from the sidelines and enclosures of the Dhaka Stadium, now known 
as the National Stadium. People blasting crackers, firing in the air and 
beating drums poured into the roads to wildly celebrate the cricket success 
which left many injured and reportedly a few dead.
    
Still the country had to wait for five more days for the ultimate accolade 
when they humbled Kenya, a surprise winner over the redoubtable West Indies 
in the last World Cup at Pune.
    
Rain intervened to extend the final to two days. Kenya knocked up 241 in 50 
overs, quite a challenging aggregate, which the critics thought was beyond 
the Bangladesh capacity to attain. The umpires cut the overs and gave the 
Dhaka side 166 to make in 25 overs, quite a daunting task to be performed 
for the batting had to be done at the crashing speed of 6.64 per over. The 
outfield was slow and handling of the spinners on the astroturf wicket was 
problematical.
    
However, as fortune favours the brave the Bangladeshis, with proper 
guidance from the legendary Greenidge, went on batting valiantly and 
courageously. With a leg-bye in the last ball they sauntered home in what 
turned out to be a thrilling and dramatic final. Bangladesh were the 
champions among 22 associate members and had qualified for the World Cup. 
They were now being euphemistically called the Bengal Tigers.
    
Dhaka again exploded with joy as traffic came to a standstill and shops and 
offices were shut with millions marching onto the roads singing hyms in 
praise of the cricketers. There was a big mass reception on the teams 
return and Prime Minister Hasina Wajed was herself at the airport to 
receive and acclaim the cricketers. Cash prizes were announced and even the 
coach, Gordon Greenidge, was given an honorary citizenship.
    
It was Bangladeshs new year and Prime Minister Hasina Wajed said: There 
could not have been a better gift for the new year than what our golden 
boys have given. She ordered construction of a new stadium, specifically 
for cricket. Certainly more facilities will be needed to boost cricket. But 
if at all the cricketers of the country have to meet the challenge of the 
region  and also the world  turf strips will be required. Cricketing 
skill cannot be honed on the artificial wickets, particularly on the 
astroturf on which a new technology has to be developed both for batting 
and bowling.
    
Could Bangladesh have beaten Kenya in normal conditions with a score of 241 
for seven wickets? It was a difficult target with the Kenyans more 
experienced and skilful. However, the Bangaldeshis were bold enough to 
canter home and beat Kenya by a head.
    
One finds that whatever may be their strength in batting they have to 
produce a more penetrating pace attack in the tussle for supremacy in the 
one-day internationals.

A. Majid Khan

KARACHI, April 26: Dr Nishat Mallick, MNA from Karachi and Patron of the 
26th National Games Organising Committee, said here today that though the 
great sports extravaganza is hardly six-week away it is a matter of immense 
satisfaction that we have almost finalised the programme for making the 
coming games in a success.
    
Dr Nishat Mallick, who chaired today's NGOC meeting at a local hotel, later 
addressing a Press conference, stated the committee reviewed the progress 
made, so far and thoroughly debated and discussed the reports of various 
sub-committees before their approval.
    
However he informed the mediamen that kabaddi has also been included as the 
21st discipline while snooker will be an exhibition event, carrying no 
points for the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, the symbol of supremacy, awarded to a 
team securing the highest points in the five-day National Games, starting 
in the city from June 8.
    
The Patron said in all 21 disciplines would be held and the list is final. 
When questioned first it was 16 disciplines and later four more were 
included and now kabbadi has been added which would certainly increase the 
expenditure.
    
Dr Nishat Mallick further stated that we would curtail the expenditures and 
hold those disciplines whcih come into our estimated expenditure of Rs one 
crore and 20 lakhs. We are yet to get Rs 15 lakhs from the PSB, which it 
routes through the Pakistan Olympic Association, and Rs 30 lakhs from the 
provincial government, stated the Patron, expressing full confidence in 
getting the promised amount in the near future.
    
There is also strong indication that the opening and closing ceremonies 
would be held at the National Cricket Stadium, said the Patron.
    
About holding of random doping test in all the disciplines , Dr Nishat 
Mallick stated it involves a huge expenditure as one doping test alone 
costs over US 200 dollars plus other required facilities in carrying out 
the test. However in weightlifting the drug abuse has earned a bad name to 
the country and the Pakistan Weightlifting Federation Secretary Muzaffar 
Qureshi is insisting on the test, the NGOC has now decided to hold token 
test in weightlifting.
    
It is beyond our financial resources to carry out doping test in other 
disciplines, he emphasised.

<a name="jans">Jansher wants coaching to produce talented stars</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, April 29: After participation in the Al-Ahram Squash Tournament in 
Egypt from June 11 to 17, Jansher Khan will go to London on June 20 and get 
his troubling left foot operated upon.
    
Jansher Khan was the guest of honour during a luncheon reception held in 
his honour by his sponsoring company. He was presented a shield and a 
cheque of Rs 1,50,000 by the Servis Industries chairman Chaudhry Shahid 
Hussain for winning the British Open Squash Championship sixth consecutive 
time and also claiming the French Open squash title. His brother and coach 
Mohibullah Junior was given an award of Rs 15,000 which was received by 
Atlas Khan on his behalf.
    
Chaudhry Shahid Hussain assured Jansher Khan that his organisation will 
continue to honour him just as it had been doing for the last ten years 
since he was a teenager. He expressed the desire to sponsor a coaching 
scheme for youngsters and promised to continue sponsoring the international 
squash tournaments and promote games like cricket, golf and tennis.
    
Jansher Khan thanked the organisers for honouring him. He said that he 
would make maximum effort to continue winning laurels for Pakistan for many 
more years. He eulogised the role of sponsors in promoting sports in the 
country.
    
During his Press conference shortly after the reception, Jansher Khan said 
that he intends to continue playing the game for four or six years more and 
create a record of winning the world title for ten or twelve years. Jansher 
Khan said that he wants to retire after creating a record which should be 
extremely difficult to beat. He said that young players like Peter Nicol 
have been challenging Pakistans supremacy but he hoped to keep that 
intact. Jansher Khan said that he would defend his World Championship title 
in Malaysia in November.

Participation in Al-Ahram ranking tournament was necessary because that 
would give me a good lead of points over the number two player, explained 
the world number one.
    
Jansher said that in 1996, he had missed the German Open, Swiss Open, 
Mohindra Open and French Open squash tournaments. That had narrowed the gap 
of points so much that at one stage he was leading Rodney Eyles by only one 
point. He had 1007 points as against 1006 collected by Rodney.
    
The world champion said that he had been facing stiff challenge from 
youngsters like Peter Nicol and Den Johnson of Australia (21-year-old). 
They were more fit but he managed to beat them with his controlled volleys 
and drops and the ability to pick or drop the ball wherever he liked.
    
Replying to a question, Jansher said that Pakistan had many youngsters like 
Mansoor Zaman, Amjad Khan and Muhammad Hussain, who could be groomed into 
world-class players. He suggested that senior players like Mohibullah Khan, 
Qamar Zaman and Gogi Alauddin should be given two players, each, under 
their wings, provided all necessary facilities and asked to groom them into 
high-class players within one year. Jansher said that a system must be 
evolved for a systematic grooming of youngsters.
    
There is no Pakistani after me, who can gain top position in international 
tournaments by beating the Australian and British challengers. If younger 
lot was not prepared within a few years, Pakistans supremacy in squash 
will be in danger. Once Pakistan lost stronghold over the game, then it 
will become very difficult to regain supremacy, said the grim-looking 
Jansher Khan.
