<a name="judg">Judges revolted with govt. support: Sajjad</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied 

KARACHI, Dec. 6: Chief Justice (under restraint) Sajjad Ali Shah 
said that judges of the apex court had revolted with the support 
and encouragement by the government.
    
He said: "The government was the main beneficiary of the revolt and 
attack on the Supreme Court building and the courtroom I was 
presiding over."
    
He told Dawn in an interview at his official residence in Bath 
Island that after having held the office of chief justice of the 
apex court for three-and-a-half years, "I am being asked by the 
judges of the same court to appear before them as a respondent to 
justify my appointment as CJ in April 1994."  "How can I appear 
before them and address them as `My Lords'?"
    
The cases, he believed are being heard together on the basis of 
decisions taken by his own courts sitting at Quetta and Peshawar.
    
"On the last date of hearing of these petitions, my counsel, Abdul 
Hafeez Pirzada and Ghulam Hussain Abbasi, sat through the 
proceedings to see what further steps are to be taken by me whether 
to contest or not to contest those petitions." He said, another 
counsel Ahmad Raza Kasuri also appeared on his behalf.
    
Justice Shah said: "I will have a conference with all these 
counsels of mine and many others who are offering to contest on my 
behalf, in Karachi shortly and finally decide whether I should 
contest or not as a respondent in these petitions."
    
The notice, he said, for his appearance or through his counsel, was 
served to him through post in Karachi. He said the SC considered 
him as its chief justice but they had restrained him from 
functioning as CJ and his administrative and judicial powers had 
been clipped.
    
How could this be done to a chief justice at the fag end of his 
career (he is due to retire on Feb. 16) after full 30 years of 
service in judiciary, right from the district and sessions judge, 
judge of the High Court, its chief justice, then judge of SC and 
its chief justice, he wondered.
    
Justice Shah said he worked for the rule of law and independence of 
judiciary and made it clear to the government that the judges would 
be appointed in consultation between the chief justices of the 
Supreme Court and of the high courts. On this issue there were 
difference with the government.
    
He said except for the appointment of Justice Ajmal Mian, Justice 
Saiduzzaman and Justice Fazal Ellahi, all other 13 judges were 
appointed to the apex court in consultation with him. The 
consultation was there and now these 13 judges are inquiring into 
his appointment. He had taken oath of their office. Is this not 
very strange? he asked.
    
He said the oath-taking of Justice Ajmal Mian as acting chief 
justice was government organized. "Everything is open now. I don't 
want to say anything about these cases, even how many are there, I 
don't know", he said.
    
The recent appointment of six judges to the High Court of Sindh was 
strictly on the basis of the Judges Case verdict. The appointments 
were made in consultation between him and the CJ of the High Court, 
he pointed out. He refused to talk about the role of the army in 
the government-judiciary tussle.

<a name="larg">Larger bench for contempt cases</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

judgment on all the pending contempt of court cases clubbed 
together after interpreting Article 19 and 66 of the Constitution 
relating to the freedom of speech by both citizens and 
parliamentarians.
    
Acting Chief Justice Ajmal Mian, in an order said that contempt 
cases should be heard by a larger bench than the existing five-
member one. He also put off the hearing of the contempt cases 
against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and six parliamentarians till 
the third week of January when the court reopens after winter 
vacations.

<a name="army">Army taking orders from PM: Defence Secretary</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 8: Federal defence secretary, Lt-Gen (retd) 
Chaudhry Iftikhar Ali Khan, has said that after the "removal of the 
8th Amendment" the Army was taking orders from the prime minister 
and not the president.

"After the removal of 8th Amendment (through 13th Amendment) all 
the powers are with the prime minister. The situation has changed 
and therefore the Army is not taking orders from the president but 
the prime minister", said the defence secretary.
    
He said this in reply to a question why the Army did not side with 
the president during the government-chief justice tussle, despite 
the fact the president is the supreme commander of the armed 
forces.

<a name="sajj">Sajjad demands full court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Rafaqat Ali
    
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 10: Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah objected to the 
constitution of the 10-member bench hearing petitions challenging 
his appointment as chief justice, and demanded constitution of a 
full court for hearing his case.
    
Through his main counsel, Mr Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, Justice Sajjad 
Ali Shah objected to the proceedings against him on the ground that 
no writ could be filed against him. He alleged that six of the ten 
judges were biased against him. He objected to the presence of 
Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, Justice Fazal Ellahi Khan, Justice 
Irshad Hasan Khan, Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, Justice Khalilur 
Rehman Khan and Justice Shaikh Riaz Ahmed.
    
Mr Abdul Hafeez Pirzada argued that the court had no jurisdiction 
to look into the validity of the appointment of the chief justice. 
A written statement on behalf of the chief justice was also filed.
    
The chief justice, whose appointment was held in abeyance by judges 
of the same court, contended that no writ or process could be 
issued to restrain him from performing his judicial functions.
    
Hafeez Pirzada, the main counsel for the chief justice, requested 
the court to strike down the argument of Mr Sharifuddin Pirzada as 
he was engaged by the government to represent its case in the 14th 
Amendment case. " I am under instructions to make this request," Mr 
Pirzada told the bench. He argued that the order of the Supreme 
Court's division bench working at Quetta registry " is nullity in 
Constitution, law and void ab initio." It was stated that order of 
the Quetta bench affected the functioning of the apex court and 
caused irreparable harm and damage to the judiciary.
    
Hafeez Pirzada argued that the order of restraining the chief 
justice from performing his duties was coram non judice as he (CJ) 
was able to perform his functions and discharge his duties in 
accordance with the Constitution.
    
Mr Pirzada argued that if the order of appointing Justice Sajjad 
Ali Shah was invalid, the appointment of 13 sitting judges of the 
Supreme Court and 43 judges of the high court would also be invalid 
as they were appointed by the petitioner.
    
He said the "doctrine of de facto" would not apply to cases in 
which consultation was mandatory. He further argued that judgment 
of the Supreme court could not be applied with retrospective effect 
and only the parliament had such powers.
    
Mr Pirzada said the "doctrine of legitimate expectancy" would apply 
neither to the appointment of the Supreme Court's chief justice nor 
to the high courts. He said this doctrine was only applicable to a 
party directly affected. "Justice Abdul Qadeer Chaudhry, Justice 
Saad Saood Jan and Justice Ajmal Mian were not the only individuals 
supposed to have been affected, questioned or agitated against the 
appointment of Mr Justice Sajjad Ali Shah as chief justice," he 
argued.
    
He said appointment of a chief justice on the basis of seniority 
was a desirable convention, but it lacked the force of the 
constitution. "Any breach of constitutional convention (unwritten) 
is not enforceable through courts of law," he contended.
    
The 10-member bench consisted of Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, 
Justice Fazal Ellahi Khan, Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, Justice Raja 
Afrasiab Khan, Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, Justice Munawar Ahmed 
Mirza, Justice Khalilur Rehman Khan, Justice Shaikh Ijaz Nisar, 
Justice Abdur Rehman Khan and Justice Shaikh Riaz Ahmed.
    
He said the Supreme Court was the final guardian of the 
constitution and argued that no appointment could be struck down 
for mere violation of a convention.
    
IMPLIED RATIFICATION: He further argued that the supreme court had 
upheld the doctrine of "implied ratification" in its recent 
judgment on a petition disputing the validity of the Eighth 
Amendment. It was held by the apex court, he argued, that since 
three legislatures had not repealed the Amendment, it had obtained 
implied ratification. "I would invoke this doctrine in the present 
case".
    
He said his client was appointed Chief Justice of Pakistan in June 
1994 and his appointment was held in "abeyance" in 1997. He wished 
that Supreme Court judges had not used the expression which the 
martial law authorities used for suspending the Constitution. 
"They, (martial law authorities) had used the same expression for 
holding the constitution in abeyance".
    
Mr Pirzada said if the Supreme Court judgment in the Judges Case 
had laid down guidelines for appointment of the chief justice, the 
executive should have acted last year rather than this year.
    
Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui asked Mr Pirzada whether he had read 
the statement of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in which she 
had revealed that a summary had been moved immediately after the 
Supreme Court judgment of March 20, 1996, for appointing chief 
justice on the basis of seniority. Mr Pirzada acknowledged that he 
had read the statement of the "former Lady Prime Minister who often 
makes contradictory statements."
    
JUDGES CASE: Justice Saiduzzaman referred to a paragraph in the 
Judges Case dealing with the appointment of the Chief Justice of 
Pakistan, which was left open. Mr Pirzada said he was fully 
conscious of the paragraph and would dwell on it when the hearing 
reached that stage. He said the Judges Case would not be applicable 
in the case of appointment of Chief Justice as the president was 
not required even to initiate the consultation process. It was 
mandatory for the appointment of judges of superior courts as well 
as the chief justice of high courts.
    
He said after the judgment of the Supreme Court on March 20, 1996, 
the legislature did not make amendments in the constitution, 
implying that the power to appoint any judge or any person who was 
qualified to become a judge of the Supreme Court as chief justice, 
remained with the president. He said there were precedents when 
lawyers were taken on the bench directly and appointed chief 
justice or made a judge of the Supreme Court. He cited the 
instances of Justice Manzoor Qadir, who was appointed chief justice 
of Lahore High Court, and Justice Abdul Qadir Shaikh, directly 
appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court.
    
Mr Pirzada objected to the acceptance of the petitions challenging 
the appointment of his client, Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, under 
Article 184(3) as it did not involve the "enforcement of any 
fundamental right". He said the apex court had the jurisdiction to 
take up any matter under its original jurisdiction only when a 
violation of fundamental rights was alleged. "My grievance is that 
you, my lords, did not apply your mind while admitting the petition 
for regular hearing."
    
He said even the Judges Case was delivered after a petitioner was 
granted leave to appeal against an order passed by the Lahore High 
Court. He, however, admitted that the petitioner in the Judges 
Case, Mr Habib Wahabul Kheiri, had also filed a constitutional 
petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.
    
FULL COURT: Asking for full court hearing, Mr Pirzada argued that 
in the wake of several "judicial orders" passed by two circuit 
benches of the Supreme Court working at Quetta and Peshawar, it was 
necessary that this case should be heard by a full court, excluding 
the chief justice and Justice Ajmal Mian.
    
He said six judges - Justice Bashir Ahmed Jehangiri, Justice 
Mukhtar Ahmed Junejo, Justice Mamoon Kazi, Justice Chaudhry 
Mohammad Arif and Justice Munir A. Shaikh - were not included in 
the full court as required under the orders of the Quetta and 
Peshawar bench orders. At this Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui 
observed that there was a consensus among judges that the matter 
required a full court hearing.
    
COMPOSITION CHALLENGED: Mr Pirzada objected to the sitting of six 
judges on the bench who were "prejudiced against my client". The 
judges are Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, Justice Fazal Ellahi Khan, 
Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, Justice 
Khalilur Rehman Khan and Justice Shaikh Riaz Ahmed.
    
Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui, it was stated, had a "direct personal 
interest" in the result and outcome of these petitions. If the 
principle laid down in the Judges Case was held to be applicable to 
the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Justice Siddiqui would be a direct 
beneficiary as on the retirement of Justice Ajmal Mian in July 
1999, the appointment of Justice Siddiqui as chief justice would be 
automatic and inevitable, Hafeez Pirzada observed. He said it 
became clear when Justice Ajmal Mian declined to act in pursuance 
of an order passed by the division bench of the Supreme Court at 
Peshawar, Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui arrogated the powers of the 
chief justice to himself.
    
Justice Siddiqui had treated the order of Quetta bench as fait 
accompli (final) and on the basis of that order, issued directives 
to the senior puisne judge to assume the functions of the chief 
justice and constituted a full court, excluding Justice Sajjad Ali 
Shah. "It was clear without an iota of doubt that Justice Siddiqui 
pre-empted and accorded finality to the order passed by the 
division bench at Quetta on Nov. 26."
    
It was further stated that Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui was in full 
knowledge that the Chief Justice had written to the president for 
referring his case to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on grounds 
of misconduct. The reaffirmation of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah's 
appointment, Mr Pirzada contended, would certainly pose a threat to 
Justice Siddiqui as his case might then be referred to the SJC. 
Justice Siddiqui was also one of the signatory judges in a letter 
to the president recommending proceedings against the Chief 
Justice.
    
He said Justice Fazal Ellahi Khan sat on the bench with Justice 
Siddiqui, despite refusal of Justice Mukhtar Ahmed Junejo, and took 
cognizance of a petition that could have been presented only at the 
principal seat in Islamabad, and assigned to a bench by the Chief 
Justice of Pakistan.
    
Justice Fazal Ellahi Khan, being a signatory to the orders of the 
Peshawar bench passed on Nov. 27 and 28, was equally disqualified 
to sit on the bench. It was further stated that Justice Fazal 
Ellahi had been reported as saying the functioning of the Supreme 
Court needed to be "democratized."
    
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah (under restraint) said on Nov. 18, 
1997, a division bench of the apex court working at Quetta had 
considered the objections to the constitution of the bench on the 
ground that it was not properly constituted as the appointment of 
the chief justice was not constitutional.
    
Later Justice Irshad Hasan Khan and Justice Khalilur Rehman Khan 
had directly entertained a petition under Article 184(3) in 
violation of the rules of the Supreme Court and ignored the orders 
passed by a previous bench on Nov. 18. They not only assumed 
jurisdiction but also without notice to the Attorney General passed 
an ex-parte interim order holding the notification of appointment 
of chief justice issued three years earlier "in abeyance", and 
passed an order restraining the chief Justice from performing his 
duties.
    
A notice was issued to Mr Sharifuddin Pirzada (who was a counsel 
for the Federation in the case challenging the 14th Amendment). He 
was requested to assist the court as amicus curiae.
    
Mr Hafeez Pirzada requested the court to strike down all arguments 
made by Mr Sharifuddin Pirzada as he was not "independent", a basic 
prerequisite for the appointment of amicus curiae.
    
Later in the evening an administrative order passed by Chief 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah was overturned by three judges, including 
Justice Irshad Hasan Khan, and they "suspended the chief justice"
    
About Justice Khalilur Rehman Khan, it was stated that in the 
petition of Malik Asad which was before the court, a specific 
reference was made to two judges - Justice Khalilur Rehman and 
Justice Shaikh Riaz Ahmed - who, according to the petitioner, had 
refused to take "dictation" from the chief justice. "The two were 
elevated to the Supreme Court, and therefore deemed to have been 
forced to accept the elevation . There can be no graver instance of 
personal aggrievement. The two learned judges have not controverted 
this allegation, although both have heard and are hearing the 
petition," it was stated.
    
He said Justice Shaikh Riaz Ahmed was law secretary on June 5, 
1994, and the notification of the appointment of the chief justice 
had been issued under his signatures. As he was a party to the 
process of appointment of the chief justice, he was not competent 
to hear petitions challenging a notification issued under his 
signatures, it was contended.
    
About Justice Nasir Aslam Zahid, it was stated that he had endorsed 
the decision by the division bench at Quetta of holding the 
appointment of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah in abeyance, and was thus 
disqualified to sit on the bench.
    
It was stated that the issue of Justice Sajjad Ali Shah's 
appointment had already been a subject matter of a petition that 
was later withdrawn. A fresh petition, it was argued, was barred.
    
Mr Pirzada said when the petition was withdrawn, Mr Habib Wahabul 
Kheiri had felicitated the chief justice by saying "Your lordships' 
appointment is now beyond question, the brother judges on the bench 
nodded." He said the order of the Quetta bench was trumpeted as the 
suspension of the chief justice. "It was announced in a manner that 
a Patwari had been suspended" .
    
SUBVERSION: Mr Pirzada said a mob organized and motivated by senior 
functionaries of the ruling party broke into the premises of the 
Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice's court room, and by 
brute force disrupted the functioning of the highest court of the 
country. "This in fact is tantamount to subversion of the 
Constitution and administration of justice guaranteed thereunder ."
    
He argued that independence of the judiciary had been undermined 
and it was high time the court interpreted Articles 5 and 6 of the 
Constitution. He referred to the execution of Adnan Menderes, prime 
minister of Turkey, who had ordered the stopping of a train 
carrying Ismet Inonu, who wanted to move a no-confidence motion 
against the prime minister.
    
When Adnan Menderes attempted suicide, he was revived and hanged to 
death to make an example of the fate awaiting those who attempted 
to subvert the constitution, Mr Pirzada recalled. He said that as 
far as he knew, all those miscreants who had attacked the Supreme 
Court were bailed out.
    
Earlier Sikandar Hayat Kasuri, elder brother of Ahmed Raza Kasuri, 
argued that the Quetta and Peshawar circuit benches had no 
jurisdiction to entertain petitions against a sitting chief justice 
because a branch registry was always set up by the chief justice. 
He also cited Order 25, rule 6 of the SC rules and said these rules 
could never be suspended. He contended that a chief justice could 
only be removed by initiating a process under Article 209 of the 
Constitution.
    
He referred to an interview of former president Farooq Ahmed 
Leghari and wondered why members of the bench had agreed to meet 
the prime minister. To this, Justice Siddiqui reminded him that 
"people" had been going to the presidency before passing certain 
orders. "Had the president disclosed their names," Justice Siddiqui 
asked.
    
Finding the response of Sikandar Hayat in the negative, Justice 
Siddiqui asked him to proceed further. The hearing will resume on 
Thursday.

<a name="scca">SC can review enactment's: Pirzada</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali
    
ISLAMABAD, Dec. 11: Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, Counsel for Chief Justice 
Sajjad Ali Shah, said that the present parliament was not the 
constituent assembly and, therefore, had no authority to change the 
basic structure of the Constitution. He said constitutional 
sovereignty of parliament was out of the purview of judicial 
review, but the legislative sovereignty of parliament was open to 
judicial review.
    
Continuing his arguments, Hafeez Pirzada said the Supreme Court had 
the jurisdiction to review all enactment's passed by parliament. He 
said time had come when the Supreme Court should save itself from 
internal and external onslaughts.
    
Mr Pirzada said his client CJ, being a human being, might have 
over-reacted under a certain situation, but the order passed by the 
Quetta bench suspending him as the Chief Justice of Pakistan was 
improper.
    
The counsel for the chief justice said he would stay short of 
repeating what President Franklin D. Roosevelt had said: "We have 
reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the 
Constitution from the court, and the court from itself."
    
Mr Pirzada who had started his argument by reading  the orders 
passed by the Quetta and Peshawar benches of the apex court and 
termed the Quetta bench order improper. He did not find anything 
wrong with the order passed by the Peshawar bench. He said the 
whole exercise proceeded on baseless assumption that there was a 
judgment at Quetta bench of the Supreme Court which had achieved 
finality in terms of Constitution, whereas only final announcement 
of judgment achieves finality and becomes the law. The orders 
passed at Quetta on Nov. 26 was ex-parte, ad- interim and inter-
locutory. They were subject to confirmation, and even if confirmed 
they could not have outlived life of the petition and would have 
merged in final judgment of the Court. "These orders did not effect 
the subsequent five judges orders to the contrary, the next day, 
when the chief justice did exist de facto and de jure. On Nov. 28, 
it was by the street muscle of mob that he was ousted from the 
court physically," the counsel said.
    
Pirzada said the five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Sajjad 
Ali Shah, which nullified the Quetta orders by majority of 4:1 on 
Nov. 27, was the lawful court even as per Quetta orders, "if these 
were to be assumed for a moment as correct". "The Quetta order did 
not restrain the chief justice from acting as judge on Nov. 27 and, 
therefore, he could lawfully preside over the bench, already in 
existence, being the senior most judge," Pirzada pointed out.
    
The 10-member bench headed by Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui heard 
the arguments of Mr Pirzada without reacting to his (counsel's) 
request for a full court hearing. Mr Pirzada said that the prime 
minister had moved to subjugate the judiciary.
    
The crisis, the counsel said, cropped up when the chief justice 
opposed the government's plan to create a parallel judicial system. 
He said parliament had passed the 13th Amendment a few days before 
the Supreme Court released the detailed observation in the 8th 
Amendment case. The government, he claimed, after perusal of the 
observation in the 8th Amendment case moved to strip the president 
of his discretionary powers.
    
When Mr Pirzada said that the present parliament was not a 
constituent assembly and had no authority to change the basic 
structure of the Constitution, Justice Fazal Ellahi Khan observed 
that 1973 Assembly, too, was not a constituent assembly but it had 
framed a new Constitution. On this, Mr Pirzada argued that 1973 
assembly was a constituent assembly and it had the mandate to frame 
the Constitution.
    
He said the Supreme Court had held that 8th Amendment had provided 
a mechanism to avoid imposition of martial law. At this, the court 
informed Mr Pirzada that a petition challenging the 13th Amendment 
was still pending in the Supreme Court and it would not be proper 
for him (Pirzada) to argue the case now.
    
Mr Pirzada said he was aware that a petition was pending in the 
court on which the chief justice had passed a " controversial 
order". He, however, said his only purpose was to highlight the 
executive's endeavours to make other institutions subservient to 
it.
    
Mr Pirzada said that after striping the president of his 
discretionary powers, the next target for the ruling party 
leadership was to bound the party legislators not to dissent and 
consequently 14th Amendment was made in the Constitution whereby a 
member of the party could be disqualified if he dissented.
    
Justice Irshad Hasan Khan pointed out that a constitutional 
petition challenging the 14th Amendment was also pending for final 
adjudication in the Supreme Court, and as interim measure a bench 
of this court had suspended its operation. Justice Khan asked 
whether a reference to the 14th Amendment was relevant now.
    
"Yes my lord, it is very much relevant", Pirzada said. He said the 
Supreme Court being the apex court of the country was the final 
arbiter of the land, and the day when the powers of judicial review 
were taken away from the judiciary, the country would cease to 
exist. Continuing his arguments Pirzada read the judgment passed by 
the Quetta bench. When he was reading the Quetta bench order, 
Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui asked if it was proper for the chief 
justice (under restraint) to sit on the bench to decide a case 
about himself.
    
Mr Pirzada said the question was not whether Chief Justice could 
sit on the bench or not. "The question is whether the November 27 
judgment by five-member bench was a judgment by the bench of 
Supreme Court or not" he argued. He pointed out that though Justice 
Mamoon Qazi on the bench disagreed with the majority judgment, he, 
too, however declared that passing of an order by the five-judge 
bench had become "absolutely necessary".
    
He said from the above facts flows the natural consequence that no 
one judge can restrain another judge. The situation, he said, would 
become alarming if judges start inhibiting each other. He asked 
would the court exist if majority of 9 out of 17 judges inhibited 8 
other judges. "This is precisely going to happen to you. A judge of 
High Court will restrain you from functioning. I have received 
record of a petition filed against your lordship in Lahore High 
Court. The trend of filing petitions against judges has set in. The 
question is if he restrains you would you obey" Pirzada posed a 
question to the bench which gave no response. He further pointed 
out that on Tuesday the High Court has formally impleaded the 
members of the bench as respondent in a case.
    
Pirzada also challenged the 10-judge bench as being constituted in 
violation of the court's own orders passed earlier. He pointed out 
that the Nov. 28 orders by Quetta bench and the Peshawar bench both 
called for a full court hearing of a matter and, therefore, the 
ten-judges bench could not hear the same. He also referred to Nov. 
18 order of the Quetta bench when the matter was referred to Chief 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah for constitution of the benches.
    
Earlier, Pirzada criticised the Nov. 26 Quetta order by Justice 
Irshad Hassan Khan and also challenged the subsequent order the 
same night on the grounds of urgency. "What was the urgency for the 
petitioner that having suffered the appointment of Chief Justice 
for the last 20 months he could not wait for morning to challenge 
the administrative orders of the Chief Justice," Pirzada argued. As 
Justice Irshad observed that the urgency related to CJ's 
administrative orders cancelling the cause list for the next day, 
Pirzada maintained that the same being intra-court matter could not 
have come on an application by adversary.
    
Pirzada differentiated between November 28 Peshawar bench order 
with that of Quetta bench order on November 26. He said in the 
Peshawar bench order Justice Saiduzzaman Siddiqui refrained from 
passing any judicial order observing that it was not necessary to 
pass an order on interim relief request. "You have not passed 
injunction against the CJ and, therefore, the matter was left open 
for the bench at Quetta which was to resume the hearing the same 
day", he said. He said the November 26 Quetta order was not an 
intra-court final order but an interim order subject to notice for 
November 28 and therefore not binding on Chief Justice Sajjad Ali 
Shah. "There is no adversary here except within the Court", he 
said.
    
Pirzada posed another question to the bench. "Suppose your orders 
directing the Registrar to constitute full court were complied and 
Chief Justice had ordered for full court. Would you accept his 
orders ?", asked Pirzada. Justice Siddiqui observed that in this 
situation there was no way out.
    
Pirzada said that since Peshawar bench of SC did not decide any 
thing except of full court, therefore, there were only two orders 
in the field confronting each other. One, Quetta bench order of 
November 26 and the five-judge order of Nov. 27.
    
Assuming for a while, he argued, that judges can restrain each 
other from exercising judicial and administrative functions then 
either both the above orders are bad or both of them are good. "If 
both the orders are bad then Justice Sajjad Ali Shah is chief 
justice as per status quo and if both the orders are good then the 
five-judge order holds ground being of larger bench and therefore 
Justice Sajjad is still the Chief Justice", Pirzada observed.
    
Hafeez Pirzada also lashed out at Attorney General Chaudhry Farooq 
and the amicus curiae Sharifuddin Pirzada in the case for 
deliberately hiding the fact from the Quetta bench during Nov. 28 
hearing that the five-judge bench through an order had nullified 
the Quetta bench earlier order of Nov. 26. He expressed his shock 
that the order by Justice Irshad after the hearing on Nov. 28 
referred to the 5-judges bench order "as a note whereas this was an 
order passed in open court". He referred to the statements of 
Sharifuddin Pirzada and attorney- general in which they also 
referred to the orders of five-judges bench as "a note". "It is an 
error on the face of record", he said.
    
Pirzada pointed out that the five-judges order had, in fact, agreed 
to consider the request for full court. To this Justice Fazal 
Illahi Khan broke his silence and observed, "the question is that 
we have been requesting the Chief Justice that such constitutional 
petitions be taken up by the full court but he always said he will 
consider but he never did".

ISLAMABAD, Dec. 12: Barrister Abdul Hafeez Pirzada, counsel for 
Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah reiterated his request for full court 
hearing, and asked the court to lift the restraint imposed on the 
Chief Justice of Pakistan.
    
Mr. Abdul Hafeez Pirzada contended the order passed by the Peshawar

Mr. Pirzada stated that he viewed the Peshawar bench order as a

<a name="watt">Wattoo, others granted bail: Baitul Maal funds case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Dec. 10: An Ehtesab bench of the Lahore High Court has 
granted bail to former Punjab chief minister Mian Manzoor Wattoo 
and three others in a Baitul Maal funds misappropriation case in 
the sum of Rs 5 million with two sureties in the like amount each.

Rejecting defence counsel Chaudhry Mushtaq Ahmad's plea for 
reducing the surety amount to Rs 500,000 each. Mr Wattoo and co-
accused Malik Haider Usman, Afzal Jafri and Abdul Jabbar Qureshi of 
Lohari Gate, Lahore, are alleged to have misappropriated Rs 100 
million of the Punjab Baitul Mall funds.

According to the prosecution, an amount of Rs 100 million was 
transferred from the Baitul Maal to Account No CD-385 in the Bank 
of Punjab for flood victims on the instructions of the then chief 
minister in Sept 1992. The title of the account was later changed 
to CM's Baitul Mall Discretionary Fund "in total negation of the 
purpose for which the amount was transferred."

An amount of Rs 10 million was allegedly paid to Mr Afzal Jafri for 
the establishment of a cadet college out of the fund, which was 
allocated for providing relief to flood victims. Malik Haider Usman 
and Jabbar Qureshi have also been assigned roles in the offence by 
the Anti-Corruption Department.

KARACHI, Dec. 11: Senator-elect Asif Ali Zardari was produced 
before the Sindh High Court on a court order amid tight security.
    
On Thursday, he made an application under Section 561-A Cr.P.C. 
(saving of inherent powers of the high court) and submitted that 
the jail authorities did not take him to Civil Hospital for an X-
ray of his right arm and to JPMC for his dental treatment as 
recommended by doctors who had examined him earlier. He stated that 
he was suffering from acute spondalitis and other related diseases, 
for which the respondent was examined by the medical board 
constituted under the orders of the DJ (South).
    
The applicant said the physiotherapist who had recently examined 
him in Karachi jail had given an opinion that the X-ray of his 
right be taken and for which it was necessary that he should be 
taken either to CHK or JPMC. He maintained that despite court 
directives, the superintendent of Central Prison failed to take him 
to the hospital.
    
It was further stated in the application that the head of the 
dental department of JPMC was of the opinion that he should be 
brought to the hospital, but he was not taken there by the SP 
Prison. A copy of the application was given to AAG Nairandas C. 
Motiani, who is representing the government.
    
The state counsel wanted to submit a counter-affidavit to the 
revision application and requested for time and by the consent of 
the parties concerned, the judge adjourned the matter till 11 am on 
Dec. 23.
    
When Mr Zardari was brought to the court, a large number of heavily 
armed policemen of all ranks, including APCs, were deployed on the 
high court premises. Some of the policemen had taken up positions 
in the triple story building. One of the APC was parked in the no 
parking area and there was a heavy rush of people to see what was 
happening. For about two hours, the situation prevailed for the 
safety of Mr Zardari.

provincial governments.
    
Extensive coordination, the minister said, between the provincial 
governments and the Pakistan Rangers was also being given priority. 
Introduction of new visa stickers for Indian nationals to guard 
against fake visas was also included in the new measures.
    
Chaudhry Shujaat said in order to identify the illegal immigrants 
and their ultimate repatriation to the country of their origin, a

<a name="rapi">Rapid erosion of already modest forex reserves</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sultan Ahmed

The small foreign exchange reserves of Pakistan have been eroding 
fast. They stood at $1.63 billion on October 25 and have now sunk 
to a low $1,280 million despite receiving the first tranche of $208 
million as first tranche under the three-year $1.6 billion deal 
with the IMF.
    
To make the situation far more critical, repayments of debt of $475 
million are due before December 31 and $2,115 million before the 
end of June, 1998. The available foreign exchange is just enough 
for five weeks imports while the safe margin according to IMF is a 
reserve equal to three months imports.
    
Exports which increased by 5.2 percent in the first quarter of this 
year against the targeted increase of 15 percent for the year have 
fallen despite the 8.7 percent devaluation of the rupee announced 
in October last following the 13.2 percent devaluation of 1996-97 
in an effort to boost the sagging exports which fell last year by 
2.7 percent against the targeted rise of 14.4 percent.
    
The balance of trade improved by 17 percent in the first quarter of 
this financial year despite the small rise in exports as the 
imports fell by one percent. But that, however, meant a sizable 
loss of customs revenues for the government. Exports are likely to 
face further problems because of the economic setback and financial 
crisis in East Asia as a whole with its global impact.
    
Textile exports have been affected and the latest report says grey 
cloth export has fallen by 6.8 percent, resulting in closure of a 
considerable number of power looms in the Punjab.
    
Cotton export which was to earn substantial foreign exchange 
following expectation of a 10 million bale crop this year has 
received a serious setback. The crop is being estimated between 8 
and 9 million bales. And the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association 
is pressing for a freeze on exports.
    
If instead the government prefers the policy of exports to continue 
while the mills remain free to import cotton that can increase the 
deficit in the balance of trade. And in the process cotton will 
come to cost more and more at home, giving the Indian textile 
exporters who get cheap cotton a major advantage over Pakistani 
textile exporters. But the loss from small export of cotton may to 
some extent be made up the export of the 300,000 ton's which has 
been permitted by the government. But now there are reports the 
surplus sugar may be less than the expected 500,000 ton's as 
sugarcane growers are using the cane to make gur as the mill owners 
are not making timely payments for the cane.
    
Home remittances which are the second major source of foreign 
exchange is said to have improved significantly in the first 
quarter of this financial ending September 30. May be more money 
flowed in foreign the 8.7 per cent devaluation of the rupee on 
October 15. But the remittances which almost touched $3 billion in 
the early 1980s have been sinking and touched $1.131 billion last 
year.
    
The fact is that Bangladesh's home remittances are double those of 
Pakistan. The surmise is Pakistan's two million overseas workers 
may be keeping or investing more of their earnings abroad in view 
of the lasting political and economic uncertainties in Pakistan and 
the frequent devaluation of the rupee. In fact even their share of 
the foreign exchange deposits in banks in Pakistan has been going 
down while those of resident Pakistanis has been increasing in view 
of the heavy battering the Pakistan rupee has been taking.
    
Foreign aid which has been shrinking while repayments are on the 
rise resulted a net aid of only $42 million last year against the 
preceding year's net receipts of $419 million. And now following 
the financial crisis in East Asia, which has enveloped Japan as 
well and has resorted in the collapse of major security firms and 
banks, may result in less foreign aid, particularly from Japan 
which is now Pakistan's largest donor.
    
The government explored other ways of getting foreign loans on a 
short term basis. It was trying to pledge PIA's earnings, and 
overseas call earnings of Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation 
and even securities the home remittances.
    
All that was before the judicial and political crisis arose. Some 
headway was made in those desperate efforts and then they froze. 
They may be resumed now in view of the acute need for foreign 
exchange to repay old loans.
    
On the part of the IMF, it wants the external current account 
deficit to be brought down to 5.1 percent of the GDP this year from 
last year's 6.4 percent alongwith the budget deficit of 5 percent. 
But they are really very tough goals in the prevailing situation. 
The IMF wants the current account deficit to be brought down to 4 
to 4.5 percent by the end of the ESAF period in 1999-2000.
    
Unless the government works earnestly in that direction and cuts 
its external expenditure sufficiently, that goal of reducing the 
external deficit to 4 to 4.5 percent, along with the budget deficit 
of 4 percent, will not be reached.
    
The government was hoping to improve the balance of payments 
through accelerated privatization. But those efforts received a 
major setback following the political crisis and vagaries of its 
economic policies and deterioration in the law and order situation, 
including the murder of four Americans in the city. 
   
The Prime Minister wanted the privatization of the public sector 
banks and development finance institutions to be completed by March 
and the rest of the units by June. Khawaja Asif chairman of the 
Privatization Commission wanted the deadline to be extended to 
December 31, 1998.  But the damage done to the image of Pakistan 
abroad and the East Asian financial crisis with its global fallout 
will slow down that process or we will be forced to sell those 
valuable projects at far below the optimum possible prices in 
better times. Meanwhile the government has made full use of the 
sale proceeds of the Habib Exchange and Securities Bank. The Schon 
Bank and the Women's Bank from buyers in the Gulf states who paid 
in foreign exchange.
    
When conditions in South East Asia became unsettled beginning with 
the Thai crisis, some foreign funds came to Pakistan for portfolio 
investment but when things became politically unsettled here and 
law and order became worse much of that money went away.
    
The hot money was also encouraged by the 8.7 percent devaluation of 
the rupee which made the cheap shares of good Pakistani companies 
even cheaper, and then the money went way to safer pastures leaving 
only a small part behind. And with the speculation now that the 
rupee may be devalued by 4 to 6 per cent more, as the exports have 
become stagnant, the Indian rupee has been devalued to the extent 
of 10 percent since August, the depreciation of East Asian 
currencies continues and the dollar becomes stronger in the process 
more and more Pakistanis are seeking financial security and better 
profitability in keeping their savings in dollars.
    
A Pakistani head of a multinational company tells me he keeps only 
the month's home expenses in rupees and the rest is kept in 
dollars. Such frequent and heavy devaluation is compelling more and 
more Pakistanis to seek the shelter of the dollar, which becomes 
stronger against other currencies as well.
    
There are reports that many who have received their golden hand-
shake payment too have kept those funds in dollar accounts, but 
that appears to be an exaggeration. Only a small number of persons 
who has chosen the golden handshake have actually received their 
full amount. 
   
Secondly many of those who have received such amounts want larger 
profits than the dollar deposits offer as they have to live on 
those earnings as well and so can't place all the savings as dollar 
deposits.  But eventually after hundreds of thousands of persons 
had received their golden handshake rewards their dollar deposits 
may rise substantially. It is comparative for the government to 
make strenuous efforts to increase exports and make them more of 
the value added, augment the home remittances by persuading 
overseas Pakistanis to bring home more of their funds and appealing 
to resident Pakistanis, who have retained large sums abroad bring 
them back, accelerate privatization in a meaningful manner and cut 
down its external expenditure to the maximum possible extent.
    
If that is not done neither the targeted foreign exchange reserve 
of $1,673 million for the current year nor the external current 
account of deficit of 5.1 per cent as stipulated by the IMF may be 
reached after a reserve over $2 billion had been achieved during

KARACHI, Dec. 8: The KSE 100-share index managed to recover 14.62 
points at 1,803.97 as compared to 1,789.35 at the last weekend. It 
has over 11 percent weightage in index and so did other blue chips, 
such as the PSO and the ICI Pakistan.
    
The total market capitalization also rose by Rs 3.343 billion to Rs 
543.047 billion as compared to Rs 541.704 billion, reflecting the 
strength of leading heavily capitalized shares.
    
Bulk of the interest was, confined to the current favorites such as 
Hub-Power, ICI Pakistan, FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, Japan and Southern 
Electric. Bank and energy shares managed to score good gains on 
active short-covering at the lower levels and finished partially 
recovered under the lead of Askari, Al-Faysal Bank, KASB & CO, PSO 
and Shell Pakistan rising by Re 1 to Rs 5.
    
MNSC such as BOC Pakistan, Engro Chemicals and Lever Brothers also 
rose by Re 1, biggest gain of Rs 61.55 being in Lever Brothers at 
Rs 1,435. Dadabhoy Sack and Packages also rose by Rs 3 to 3.25. 
Losses on the other hand were mostly fractional barring, Searle 
Pakistan, Pak Papersack and Gadoon Textiles, falling by Re 1 to Rs 
2.50.
    
Volume figure fell to 36.394 million shares from the weekend 38 
million shares owing to the absence of leading buyers. Out of the 
187 actives, 68 shares ended lower, while 62 rose, with 57 holding 
on to the last levels. A substantial decline in the volume was also 
attributed to the absence of PTCL whose shares are still traded on 
the spot basis and once it was shifted to ready transactions, the 
volume figure could soar to the daily average figure of 50 million 
shares.
    
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, up 55 paisa on 19.469 
million shares; followed by ICI Pakistan, firm 15 paisa on 9.373 
million shares; Southern Electric, up 35 paisa on 1.451 million 
shares; FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, lower 10 paisa on 0.841 million 
shares and Askari Bank, higher 65 paisa on 0.0.670 million shares.

30 paisa on 0.511 million shares; Dhan Fibre, easy five paisa on 
0.357 million shares; Ibrahim Fibre, unchanged on 0.203 million 
shares; ICP SEMF, steady five paisa on 0.203 million shares; and 
Japan Power, lower five paisa on 0.292 million shares.
    
Defaulting companies: Trading in this sector was picked up as all 
the three shares, National Modaraba, Crescent Textiles, and 
Sunshine Cotton, which came in for trading finished unchanged at Rs 
070,6.75 and 0.50 on 4,500, 2,000 and 500 shares, respectively.

KARACHI, Dec. 12: The KSE 100-share index suffered a fresh 
fractional decline of 1.06 points at 1,759.41 as compared to 
1,760.47 a day earlier. The market capitalization also fell Rs 534 
million at Rs 529.356 million as compared to Rs 529.890 million a 
day earlier.
    
Although prices changes were mostly fractional, some of the leading 
shares managed to post good gains under the lead of Shell Pakistan, 
which recovered Rs 20 on active short-covering after having by the 
same amount during the last couple of sessions. PSO followed it, 
rising by Rs 4 followed by Sana Industries, Abbott Lab and Mehmood 
Textiles, which posted gains ranging from Rs 2.50 to 5.
    
Barring a sharp decline in Lever Brothers, which fell Rs 44 on 
profit-selling at the higher levels, and a decline of Rs 2.25 in 
Citicorp, others declines were mostly fractional and reflected lack 
of support rather than large selling from any quarter, with the 
exception of Siemens Pakistan, Engro Chemical, Reckitt and Colman, 
and Leather-up, which suffered decline ranging from Re 1 to Rs 
1.50. Trading volume fell to 6-month lows of 17 million shares, 
while gainers cut short the lead held by losers at 44 to 57, with 
34 shares holding on to the last levels.
    
Hub-Power again led the list of most actives, lower five paisa on 
8.247 million shares; followed by Southern Electric, lower 45 paisa 
on 2.768 million shares; PTCL, easy 10 paisa on 2.632 million 
shares; ICI Pakistan, down five paisa on 1.085 million shares; and 
Dhan Fibre, unchanged on 0.471 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, 
lower 15 paisa on 0.105 million shares; Kohinoor Energy, off 35 
paisa on 0.100 million shares. All other transactions were well 
blow 0.100 million share mark even in most of the current 
favorites.
    
Eight companies announced their working results for the year ended 
June 30,1997, but no one among them declared dividend for their 
shareholders. Although most of them suffered fresh losses, the 
newly listed Nian Industry showed a post-tax profit of Rs 35.770 
million but omitted the dividend, which should have the maiden one.
    
Others, which followed it was Valika Art Fabrics, which earned a 
modest post-tax profit of Rs 0.071 million but did not declare any 
payout. Hala Enterprises, Morafco Industries, Indus Fruit Products, 
Ashfaq Textiles, Punjab Oil Mills, and Transmission Engineering 
were the others with blank years.

By Ardeshir Cowasjee

THEORETICALLY, in a Westminster-style democracy that this country 
has tried to emulate, there are four pillars of state - the 
legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and the press. But our 
country rests imbalanced on five. The fifth pillar, the most 
powerful, the richest, the most organized, is the army. Fortunately 
for us, it is now headed by a good commander.
    
Nawaz Sharif's `overwhelming' mandate, comprising less than ten per 
cent of the total population of the Republic, but sufficient for 
him and his `sovereigns of parliament' to do good by the 140 
million should they so wish, did not satisfy him.
    
He first tackled the executive, emasculating the president, rushing 
through at midnight the 13th Amendment, suspending all rules of 
procedure, aided and abetted by a pliant assembly speaker and a 
pliant senate chairman (both front-runners in the present 
presidential race). To neutralize the legislature, he repeated the 
exercise with his 14th Amendment (passed without a single dissent) 
banning dissension or abstention in parliament. Never in the 
recorded history of any democracy have parliamentarians voluntarily 
given up their right to speak.
    
At the time when Farooq Leghari and his caretaker government were 
assuring Nawaz Sharif his second term, Abbaji was heard to declare, 
"leghari Sahib kay ehsan, mein, aur merey baitey, aur hamara 
khandan, kabhi nahin, bhoolengey." This was forgotten on February 3 
when Nawaz Sharif was elected.
    
Nine months down the line, a weakened Leghari, given the choice 
between a threatened impeachment (which, because of the numbers 
game, may never have come off) or resignation, chose the latter. He 
should have called Nawaz Sharif's bluff, and, following the 
dictates of his conscience, gone on to sign or not sign whatever 
was presented to him. An independent judiciary would have 
intervened and passed appropriate orders against a mala fide and 
colorable impeachment.
    
Leghari having resigned, a new president now has to be elected. 
When my friend, Nawab Mohammad Akbar Shahbaz Khan, Tumandar Bugti, 
was asked whether he was an aspirant, he replied "No. I do not 
qualify. I have a spine." Amongst the pliable favorites are Wasim 
Sajjad, Sartaj Aziz, Ilahi Bakhsh Soomro, and, of all people, Ghous 
Ali Shah. Of this sorry lot, one is guilty of having lied under 
oath in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
    
The fourth pillar of the state, the press, is no longer just the 
printed word. it is also the predominating electronic media. Nawaz 
Sharif and his men do not, or cannot, read, so, by and large, we 
remain relatively free. PTV, our prime ministers' personal 
television channel, remains abjectly controlled, so much so that it 
was prevented from broadcasting President Leghari's resignation 
speech to the nation. Shots were shown on foreign television 
channels, and the world informed that it was banned from the 
national channel. This reinforced international opinion as to Nawaz 
Sharif's authoritarian tendencies.
    
The army stands as one. Chief of Army Staff General Jehangir 
Karamat has acted prudently. Nawaz Sharif's propaganda about his 
having army backing is neither correct nor is it generally 
believed.
    
Why do you glorify the army chief so, asked Ayaz Amir (not so long 
ago one of our credible national columnists but now a budding 
Nawazite)? Have you forgotten your history? Have you forgotten how 
Hitler divided and destroyed the Wehrmacht? Have you forgotten the 
Blomberg-Fritsch affair? Have you forgotten how the ageing giant 
Hindenburg was duped by Hitler? If Nawaz succeeds in his aim, will 
Karamat be forgiven? I told him I had not forgotten any of it and 
how not so long ago I had sent to the general a copy of a video 
film on the Fuhrer which is being followed up by a copy of Shirer's 
`The Rise and Fall of the third Reich'.
    
As for the judiciary, Nawaz Sharif with his (or rather, our) money, 
with his carrots and sticks, has successfully managed to undermine 
this institution so recently built up. Neither history nor the 
people can ever forgive him for this.
    
Chief Justice of Pakistan Sajjad Ali Shah (to the Bar and the 
people he is neither `under restraint' nor `under suspension') was 
appointed by Benazir in 1994. No judge, or member of the Bar, up to 
November of this year, voiced any protest against his appointment 
or his administration. As Rashed Rahman, son of a former Supreme 
Court judge, wrote about him in The Nation, "That he is a man of 
courage and has a clean record goes without saying. In that sense 
he can be compared to a hero of a Shakespearian tragedy whose fall 
is brought about as much by a flaw in his own character as by 
outside factors."
    
Fali Nariman, a former Attorney-General of India and now president 
of the bar association of India, who keeps himself abreast of 
happenings in the courts of our country, asked me to fax him the 
orders passed by the Quetta and Peshawar Benches and by Chief 
Justice Sajjad Ali Shah relating to the ouster. On December 5, a 
perplexed Nariman asked, `but is there any legal or constitutional 
basis for the orders of the Quetta and Peshawar Benches?"
    
My constitutional adviser and senior counsel, Barrister Makhdoom 
Ali Khan, was immediately consulted. Careful Makhdoom's first 
response was to say, "Not to my knowledge." I asked him for a one-
word answer, either `yes' or `no'. "No," he said. There are 
certainly no precedents in Pakistan for what has happened, but 
there are many against. It is a settled principle that no writ will 
be issued by one judge to another.
    
On November 28, I was in the Supreme Court whilst the contempt case 
against Nawaz Sharif and others was being heard by Chief Justice 
Shah's Bench. Sitting beside me was my friend and lawyer, Khalid 
Anwer, now federal law minister. Whilst alleged contemner Nawaz 
Sharif's lawyer, S.M. Zafar, laboured on and on, Khalid shook his 
head from side to side. Zafar, making his usual noises, shifting 
his weight from one foot to the other, told the court that its 
constitution was in question. A calm and composed Sajjad asked, why 
then are you here before us? Zafar also questioned the legitimacy 
of Sajjad's appointment as chief justice. If you do not recognize 
me as chief justice, do you recognize me as a judge of the Supreme 
Court? queried Sajjad.
    
As the harangue continued, I remarked to Khalid that his writ as 
law minister does not extend far, and asked if it would extend far 
enough for him to protect my seat whilst I nip out to attend to a 
call of nature. Good humouredly, he replied that though he may not 
succeed as law minister, he could manage to do so as a senior 
counsel of the Supreme Court. Before I could reach my destination 
one floor below the courtroom, a surging screaming crowd of 
hooligans appeared in the corridors. Zahid Hussain, correspondent 
for The Times (London) and the chief of AP in Pakistan, was with 
me. We were both hurriedly sent back by court officials who were 
rushing around instructing each other that the doors of the 
courtroom be closed, that the crowd had arrived to arrest the Chief 
Justice.
 
As we re-entered, I heard Sajjad remark, to Zafar, "Thanks to you," 
whilst adjourning the case and leaving the courtroom just before a 
section of the crowd, spearheaded by women, rushed in. Turning to 
Khalid I said that if Nawaz Sharif must use women, he should at 
least see to it that they are good looking rather than frightening. 
A lawyer of Lahore standing close by informed me that they were not 
actually women, but intermediary beings, and that I would look like 
them were I to shave off my beard and moustache and put on lipstick 
and make-up. He even recognized a few of them as being famous 
`tanglas' from certain specialized areas of Lahore. As we pushed 
our way out of the courtroom, a dejected Khalid Anwar muttered to 
himself, "Most unnecessary, most unnecessary."
    
Acting Chief Justice Ajmal Mian is so far clean on record, and, as 
far as is publicly known, free from any impropriety. His first 
challenge is to deal with all those involved in the attack on the 
Supreme Court. This will not be easy. It must nevertheless be 
faced. The mob did not attack a man, or a building. The institution 
of the judiciary, with the Supreme Court at its apex, was the 
target of the assault. This was contempt of court of the worst 
kind, and any lack of firmness or alacrity in dealing with the 
culprits will only encourage others to use similar methods each 
time the court is seized of a politically sensitive matter. The 
authority of the court will become subject to the muscle- power of 
the mob and the machinations of those who hire them.
    
The master-fixer, my friend the Jadoogar of Jeddah, Sharifuddin 
Pirzada, who snoozed besides me as we flew back to Karachi, was 
firm in his opinion that the gravest of contempt had been 
committed, that it's an open and shut case.

<a name="topu">To put a gloss over a blemish</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Aziz Siddiqui

HOWEVER apt the rejoicing over the supposed end of the 
constitutional crisis, one aspect of it must for honesty's sake be 
questioned. It is being claimed that the war against the judiciary 
and the presidency was waged for the supremacy of the parliament, 
and that the `victory' achieved is a vindication of that objective. 
This may not be deliberate deception, but it certainly puts a heavy 
gloss over something far less edifying both in its origin and 
conclusion.
    
First, the crisis, it will be recalled, began with the question of 
the chief justice of the time recommending elevation of five named 
judges to the supreme court. From around August 20 up to the middle 
of October there was practically no other issue in contest - not 
publicly. And the resistance to the recommendation, in fact not-so-
veiled refusal to comply with it, was coming from the chief 
executive, not the parliament. It is possible to draw that 
distinction because there was no pre- existing legislation to 
authorize the leader of the house to invalidate the chief justice's 
recommendation.
    
The (now restrained) chief justice for his part was pursuing his 
case on the ground, first, that at the time he made his 
recommendation those five vacancies did exist and, second, that his 
word had to be honoured not only out of consideration for the 
prestige of his office but also by virtue of the judgment in the 
so-called Judges Case. That judgment incidentally had been 
enthusiastically welcomed by the leader of the opposition of that 
time and the prime minister of the present, Mian Nawaz Sharif, and 
his party, and which they never contested even now during this 
crisis.
    
The Constitution did, it is true, give the executive, as also the 
parliament, the power to fix the number of judges in the supreme 
court. But since in the present instance the executive notification 
on the subject came just about the same time that the chief justice 
had sent up his recommendation it was seen as a gambit specifically 
to nullify the latter.
    
The prime minister's later haggling over the number, and then the 
names, of the persons recommended further confirmed that this was 
no contest over constitutional rights but only an anxiety over some 
extra-constitutional concerns. At no stage did this seem or was 
made to seem a bid to assert the supremacy of the parliament. In 
short, there was no conflict yet between the functions of the 
judiciary and the parliament. (And yet the press had already begun 
to be fed with news about the intent to haul the chief justice 
before the supreme judicial council and to move for the impeachment 
of the president).
    
Secondly, where there was indeed some interference with the 
parliament's law-making - as in that most explosive issue of the 
crisis, the suspension of the anti-defection 14th Amendment - it 
came much later, at the end of October. And it was in apparent 
accord with the Constitution, as even the attorney-general admitted 
to the court on the day of the hearing. The Constitution empowers 
the supreme court to rule over the constitutional compatibility of 
a legislation.
    
Article 8 (1) and (2) says: "Any law, or any custom or usage having 
the force of law, in so far as it is inconsistent with the rights 
conferred by this chapter, shall, to the extent of such 
inconsistency, be void." And, "The State shall not make any law 
which takes away or abridges the rights so conferred, and any law 
made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of such 
contravention, be void..."
    
Who is to decide the inconsistency and the contravention? Article 
184(3) gives the answer: "...the Supreme Court shall, if it 
considers that question of public importance with reference to the 
enforcement of any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Chapter I 
of Part II is involved, have the power to make an order of the 
nature mentioned in the said Article."
    
That obviously made every legislation open to the test of 
compatibility by the supreme court. The writ against the 14th 
Amendment was by that token admissible. So also would have been any 
complaint, say, against the Anti-Terrorism Act. The chief justice 
refrained from doing anything while this terrorism was before the 
parliament although his sentiments against the setting up of a 
parallel judiciary were well known.
    
As regards the chief justice's action over alleged contempt of 
court by some of the National Assembly members, that too was no 
apparent breach of parliamentary supremacy.
   
The Constitution forbids the parliament discussing `the conduct of 
any judge of the Supreme Court or of a High Court in the discharge 
of his duties.' According to press reports, apart from legitimate 
criticism of the supreme court's suspension of the 14th Amendment a 
lot else was also said that day inside and outside the Assembly. 
The Dawn correspondent reported that for whole two hours invectives 
against the chief justice flew thick and fast, and only after 
everyone with venom to pour had had his say and the press reporters 
had left that the deputy speaker had ordered the outpourings 
expunged. The onslaught would still probably have been ignored, but 
considering the state of confrontation at the time it was no 
surprise that it was not.
    
Finally, there were indeed instances, though late in the crisis, 
where the chief justice did seem to overstep the limits. The bill 
amending the law of contempt was innovative in that it provided for 
an appeal against a supreme court conviction for contempt, for 
automatic stay of the conviction, and for that appeal to be heard 
by another set of judges of the same court. Yet there was no 
precedent, nor apparent ground in law, for the chief justice to 
prohibit the president's assent to that bill, and even less to rule 
the bill suspended if the assent had already been given.
 
Similarly, the grant of temporary restoration of the presidential 
power to dissolve the National Assembly(the repealed Article 
58(2)b) on the ground of a breakdown of the constitutional 
machinery was obviously an act of desperation to prevent a feared 
collapse. It was virtually the last throw of the dice in a do-or-
die gamble. Thus if in these two instances the judiciary did seem 
unduly to interfere with the parliament's function, they occurred 
at the height of the crisis, after the battle had been joined and 
the heels firmly dug in. They were a consequence, not the cause, of 
the conflict.
    
Supremacy of the parliament is of course a basic element of the 
parliamentary form of government. In practical terms, however, the 
supremacy has limits and restraints.  Interior minister Mr. Shujaat 
Hussain said at the height of the crisis that if there were lacunae 
in the 14th Amendment these could be corrected.
   
Law minister Mr. Khalid Anwar remarked afterwards that if the court 
had objection to denial of the right of dissent in that Amendment 
it should have confined itself to just that instead of suspending 
the whole Amendment. Why these `ifs' after so much damage? Why 
didn't they themselves consider these possibilities before making 
the law? Why didn't they give themselves, the opposition and the 
country time to examine all its aspects? What was the rush? What 
were they scared of?
    
In fact this seems a congenital flaw of this government. It has had 
all its major legislation's, the 13th and 14th Amendments, and the 
ehtesab and the terrorist laws, hustled through the two houses in 
tearing hurry, often by suspending rules and procedures and 
preempting all debate, as if any airing will cause a foul-up or 
exposure of some guilt. If there is a lack of educated consensus on 
these measures, even over the repeal of 58(2)b, it is partly 
because people have not had the assurance that these have been run 
through with a fine comb in the parliament.
    
The question whether the judiciary was usurping the parliamentary 
function of making law instead of just interpreting it came up most 
starkly at the time of the Judges Case. From that beachhead, and 
through subsequent judgments on the Eighth Amendment, the toppling 
of Benazir government and the respective powers of the president 
and prime minister, the judiciary grew fast in its own esteem and 
began to look upon itself as much more of an arbiter in the affairs 
of the state than perhaps it should have. Mr. Nawaz Sharif was then 
of course wholly on the side of the so-called judicial activism. He 
would still be were he in the opposition. It is current suitability 
rather than political conviction that often determines party 
attitudes even on fundamentals.
    
This is a cause for worry for the future. The post-martial law 
period has been coloured by shades of absolutism and messiahism. 
First it was the president brandishing the weapon of 58(2)b in the 
name of checks and balances. Then briefly came the judiciary 
resplendent in its armour of the Judges Case and invoking the 
principle of independence of the judiciary. Now it seems it is the 
turn of the elected executive to enforce its version of 
unchallengeable supremacy of the parliament through its 14th 
Amendment and its bonded parliamentary majority. There are still 
battles ahead.

<a name="cont">Contempt law is an anachronism</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Makhdoom Ali Khan

THE contempt power of the courts has been a subject of considerable 
controversy. No one seriously disputes that the power is necessary 
to enforce judicial orders and maintain decorum in the courtroom. 
The power to punish for scandalizing a judge and comment on sub 
judice proceedings raises serious constitutional issues, however. 
The press has now maintained for some time that the law needs 
change. The offense of scandalizing a judge must be abolished. It 
has no place in a constitutional democracy.
    
The judges like everyone else have the right to defend their 
reputation. The means available to them must also be no different 
from those of other citizens. The law of defamation is an adequate 
safeguard. If it is not, it must be reformed. This does not, 
however, justify equipping the judges with the contempt power to 
keep their name clean.
    
More than twenty years have passed since the legislature last gave 
the matter some thought. The Contempt of Court Act, 1976, made some 
positive changes. The offense of scandalizing the judge was 
unfortunately not scrapped. The dangers of this jurisdiction and 
the extent to which it can be misused have been the subject of much 
comment. The recent contempt proceedings against the prime minister 
and some of his colleagues have brought the issue once again to 
public attention. No comment can be made on these proceedings for 
the matter is sub judice. The government which till recently was 
not sympathetic to the pleas for reform may now be less unwilling 
to reconsider the issue.
    
There is a marked difference between interference with the 
administration of justice and criticism of a judicial decision or a 
judge. The distinction has often been ignored by the courts in the 
subcontinent. British justice played a vital role in legitimizing 
colonial rule in India. The press was keen to point out that the 
courts were as tainted with bias against the people of India as the 
rest of the administration. The law of contempt was meant as a 
political weapon to stifle such criticism of British justice.
    
The colonists were completely unabashed about it. In the United 
Kingdom the courts declared that the offense of scandalizing a 
judge was obsolete. In 1899 the Privy Council (the highest court of 
appeal for the colonies) declared that committals for contempt of 
court, "by scandalizing the court itself have become obsolete in 
this country. Courts are satisfied to leave to public opinion 
attacks or comments derogatory or scandalous to them." The blacks 
and browns were, however, to be adjudged differently. The Privy 
Council did not even take the trouble of veiling its prejudices. In 
that very judgment it observed, "in small colonies, consisting 
principally of colored populations, the enforcement in proper cases 
of committal for contempt of court for attacks on the courts may be 
absolutely necessary to preserve in such a community the dignity of 
and respect for the court."
    
Our political leaders have not felt the need to change the 
anachronistic law. They perhaps still believe that their colonial 
masters knew best. Elsewhere the law has been steadily reformed. 
Lord Denning went out of his way to emphasize the importance of the 
right to comment on all matters of public interest, including the 
administration of justice. "We do not fear criticism, nor do we 
resent it. For there is something far more important at stake. It 
is no less than freedom of speech itself. It is the right of every 
man, in Parliament or out of it, in the press or over the 
broadcast, to make fair comment, even outspoken comment, on matters 
of public interest. Those who comment can deal faithfully with all 
that is done in a court of justice. They can say that we are 
mistaken and our decisions erroneous, whether they are subject to 
appeal or not."
    
In Australia the High Court refused to accede to the proposition, 
"that an imputation of want of impartiality to a judge is 
necessarily a contempt of Court." In the United States the Supreme 
Court overturned a conviction for scandalizing the court on the 
ground that it abridged free speech. Even the Privy Council has now 
held that imputing bias to a judge is not contempt and justice must 
be allowed to suffer the scrutiny and even outspoken comments of 
ordinary men. In our own country, Mr. Justice Mamoon Kazi, then a 
judge of the High Court of Sindh, has provided the lead. He 
dismissed an application for contempt against a lawyer and some 
newspapers for criticizing, in very strong language, appointments 
of high court judges made by the Benazir Bhutto government. This 
landmark judgment has unfortunately not been much noticed by the 
press.
    
Justice Kazi may have articulated it better but he is not alone. 
Others too, in recent years, have used this power sparingly. Even 
harsh criticism has been ignored. The judiciary appears to be 
conscious of the fact that there is a need for a fresh approach to 
the law. Neither the Bench nor the Bar are much perturbed by the 
implications which the retention of this jurisdiction has for free 
speech. Its constitutionality has never been seriously questioned. 
The fact that the judges have the authority to commit for contempt 
those who criticize them or their judgments has a chilling effect 
on free expression.
    
The thought of being hauled up before a court deters people from 
writing or speaking about them. It prevents an open discussion and 
even fair comment on one of the vital state institutions. The 
judicial authority to punish for scandalizing a court or a judge 
continues to remain, as Justice Krishna Iyer calls it, "a vague and 
wandering jurisdiction with uncertain frontiers, a sensitive and 
suspect power."
    
It is time for the government and the Parliament to act. The power 
to punish for scandalizing a court or a judge must be phased out. A 
clear line of demarcation must be drawn between the criticism of a 
judge or his judgment and interference with the administration of 
justice. While any attack on the latter must be severely dealt 
with, the former must be exposed to public scrutiny. The press and 
the people must be free to criticize, without fear, the exercise of 
judicial power and the conduct of judges.
    
It is important to maintain the image of the judiciary. It is 
absolutely vital to ensure that its work remains free from 
interference. An independent judiciary is essential for democracy 
but so is a free press.
   
The two interests may at times conflict but they must be balanced. 
If one has to err, one must err in favor of a fee press. The right 
to criticize judges as the 1969 Committee on the Law of Contempt in 
England observed, "may be one of the safeguards which helps to 
ensure their high standard of performance." After fifty years of 
independence the colored people of former colonies must not be 
denied free speech.

<a name="saql">Saqlain bowls Pakistan to a position of strength</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 6: Pakistan got the start they wanted in quest for 
handing the West Indies their first white-wash in 69 years when 
Saqlain Mushtaq spun the visitors out for 216 on the opening day of 
the final Test at the National Stadium here on Saturday.
    
The tourists, after an impressive start on a perfect batting 
surface, went down on their knees against the Pakistan off-spinner 
who virtually toyed with them to finish with a career-best five for 
54, his third five-wicket haul in an innings.
    
Skipper Wasim Akram gave a good helping hand to his young spinner 
when he returned with figures of three for 76. Akram, who requires 
29 runs to join the elite company of Kapil Dev, Imran Khan and Sir 
Richard Hadlee with 2,000 runs and 300 wickets, now has 330 scalps 
in 77 matches.
    
The home team completed a wonderful day in the field by reaching 34 
for no loss when an early closure was applied because of fading 
light. A little over six overs were still to be bowled when the two 
openers Aamir Sohail (20) and Ijaz Ahmad (11) accepted the umpires 
offer.
    
Saqlain Mushtaq, who now has 52 wickets in 13 Tests, completely 
dominated the West Indians with a mixture of accurate off-spinners, 
floaters and `secret' deliveries.
    
Saqlain's performance was also a slap on the face of those who said 
he was not a Test bowler. The finger spinner, it may be mentioned, 
was not played in the first two Tests at Peshawar and Rawalpindi 
despite being in the squad of 13. But Saqlain stamped his 
superiority over others with a performance which has left the West 
Indies a mountain to climb. The dismal batting performance must 
have further dented their morale which is already at its lowest ebb 
after thrashings in the first two Tests.
    
After first day's play, one thing is certain - West Indies cannot 
win from here but Pakistan can lose if the batsmen don't realize 
their responsibilities and bat sensibly.

After Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat, the West 
Indies looked to have found their batting rhythm on a placid track 
when Sherwin Campbell and Brian Lara batted with ease and grace to 
take the score to 109 for one shortly after lunch. It was then that 
Saqlain Mushtaq got his acts together and after bowling Brian Lara 
with a gem of a delivery, never looked back. He went on to add the 
scalps of Sherwin Campbell (50), Ronald Holder (26), Ian Bishop (2) 
and Courtney Walsh (1).
    
Mushtaq Ahmad, was in action for a brief period in which he had the 
wicket of Carl Hooper off a beautiful leg-spinner that left the 
batsman stranded in front of the wickets.
    
Hooper's return, seven balls after the dismissal of Lara, was the 
final nail in the West Indies coffin. The tourists never recovered 
from those two quick setbacks as they collapsed to 216 all out some 
45 minutes before stumps. The last nine wickets could yield just 
107 runs, including a contribution of 28 runs from last five 
wickets.
    
Brian Lara, who scored 36 with six glorious boundaries, tried to 
play an inside-out cover-drive but was first beaten in the air and 
then off the wicket as the ball, instead of turning away, came 
slightly in to take his stumps.
    
Sherwin Campbell continued his good form when he scored a well 
played 50 off 117 balls with six boundaries and a six. He was 
smartly caught by Aamir Sohail off a rebound from Wasim Akram's 
knee in the slips off Saqlain.
    
For Campbell, dropped twice when 6 and 14, it was his third half 
century in five innings on this tour. Besides, he was also involved 
in a series-best opening stand of 47 runs with Stuart Williams who 
failed to beat an accurate throw from an athletic Mushtaq Ahmad 
from mid-on.
    
It has once again been Pakistan's bowling strength that has enabled 
the team to dictate terms. Otherwise, the cricket authorities had 
slammed all doors at them for a white-wash after preparing a track 
as flat as this one. It was astonishing and mind-boggling to see 
the condition of the wicket. Whatever little grass was left on the 
wicket, was mowed off on Friday evening and by rolling it 
repeatedly, they made it ideal for stroke-play. Had Brian Lara 
avoided a suicidal shot and then Saqlain Mushtaq not mesmerised 
West Indians, situation might have been quite different.
    
It is time that for the authorities to get rid of the groundsmen 
who can't prepare a pitch which can suit the home team. Besides, 
the authorities should themselves change their attitude and 
encourage more sporting wickets like Rawalpindi rather than making 
their bowlers to toil on such dreadful wickets.

<a name="soha">Sohail and Ijaz rub salt into Windies' wounds</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 7: Openers Aamir Sohail and Ijaz Ahmad caused further 
embarrassment to the embattled West Indies as Pakistan sat on the 
back of the tourists in the third and final cricket Test at the 
National Stadium.
    
Sohail and Ijaz put on record 298 runs for the first wicket as 
Pakistan finished the second day at 327 for one. Pakistan, bidding 
to be the first team in 69 years to whitewash the West Indies, now 
lead by 111 runs with nine wickets and three days to spare. West 
Indies, on Saturday, were shot out for 216 in their first innings.
 
Sohail slammed a belligerent 160 before becoming the only wicket to 
fall in the day which saw 293 runs being scored in 84 overs. 
However, make-shift opener Ijaz Ahmad remained composed and 
determined to be still batting on an exquisite 127. He had resumed 
this morning at 11 with Pakistan starting their innings at 34 for 
no loss. With Ijaz was Saeed Anwar on 15. A stiff neck had 
restrained Anwar from opening the innings on Saturday. He might, 
however, be regretting his decision now.
    
After second day's play, the once unbeatable West Indies appear to 
be all but dead and buried. If innings thrashings were not enough 
for them in the two earlier Tests, they now face the anomaly of 
even failing to dismiss the charged-up Pakistanis in this Test.
    
Sohail and Ijaz became the first Pakistan opening pair in 243 Tests 
to score centuries in an innings. When the duo reached 160 of the 
stand, they erased Majid Khan and Zaheer Abbas from record books 
who had put on 159 runs against the West Indies for the first 
wicket at Georgetown in 1976-77.
    
Sohail and Ijaz also bettered Pakistan's previous best-ever opening 
wicket stand of 249 between Khalid Ibadullah and Abdul Kadir which 
was against Australia at the same venue 33 years ago.
    
Interestingly, Ijaz had opened an innings for the first time in a 
Test though he began his career in the Under-19 championships for 
PACO Shaheen as an opener.
    
The innings of Sohail and Ijaz were of contrasting styles. Sohail 
was more aggressive than Ijaz who was cautious and rightly so as he 
had not scored enough runs in his last six innings that only 
produced 118 runs.
    
Sohail, who faced 254 balls for his 160, batted for little under 
six hours during which he hit 21 punishing boundaries. He reached 
his first 50 off 82 balls with nine boundaries. His second 50 came 
off 56 balls with seven hits to the fence.
    
Ijaz, on the contrary, scored his first 50 runs from 83 balls with 
four fours and a six. But he took 120 balls to score the second 50 
that included four boundaries. Ijaz's 127 has so far come off 284 
balls with 11 boundaries and a six. He has already consumed 401 
minutes at the crease.
    
It was after a long time when Sohail blitzed the opposition with 
his trademark attacking and commanding innings. Ijaz, on the 
contrary, took his time in the centre and picked the balls to score 
runs.
    
Sohail struck blistering drives and cuts while Ijaz sweetly flicked 
off his toes besides driving with ferocious power. But both the 
knocks were flawless and full of elegance, grace, maturity and 
discipline.
    
It was Sohail's fourth century of the season after having earlier 
hit 128 against South Africa, 170 against KRL for ABL and 160 
against West Indies last week at Rawalpindi. But it was the first 
hundred for Ijaz in six Tests this year after his last (113) was 
against Sri Lanka in April.
    
Overall, it was the fourth century by Aamir Sohail in 38 Tests and 
eighth in 42 Tests for Ijaz. The two batsmen also silenced their 
critics by making their bats do the talking. Ijaz Ahmad was told at 
Peshawar by a selector that he has played his final Test while 
Sohail's career was almost ended earlier this year by the cricket 
board had the government not intervened.
    
Ijaz, in the last two years, has emerged as Pakistan's most 
consistent stroke-maker after Inzamamul Haq since staging a 
comeback in Australia as a substitute for Saeed Anwar. In his last 
27 innings of 19 Tests, he has scored 1,223 at 48.92, including six  
centuries.
    
Pakistan's dominance over the West Indies can be figured out from 
the fact that they scored 102 runs in the first session, added 110 
runs in the second and put on 81 runs in the final session that was 
curtailed by six overs because of bad light.

<a name="over">Saqlain overshadows Dillon, Hooper on an eventful day</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 8: Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq pushed the West 
Indies to the brink of only their second whitewash in 69 years on 
an eventful third day of the third and final cricket Test at the 
National Stadium.

On a day which saw 16 wickets tumbling down, Saqlain followed up 
his five for 54 with four for 25 as the West Indies plunged into 
further depths after being reduced to 198 for seven when bad light 
forced an early closure by 15 overs.
    
Earlier in the day, Pakistan resuming this morning at 327 for one, 
went crashing out for 417 with Mervyn Dillon leading a rare West 
Indies fightback with a career-best five for 111. Courtney Walsh 
removed the tail to finish with four for 74 and completed 350 
wickets in Test cricket.
    
With the defeat almost inevitable for the West Indies, what has 
made this Test interesting is the fact that whether it would again 
be by an innings margin. The West Indies still require three more 
runs to make the Pakistanis bat for the first time in their second 
innings. Pakistan won by an innings and 19 runs at Peshawar and 
improved their victory margin at Rawalpindi by winning by an 
innings and 29 runs.
    
If Pakistan achieve victory by an innings, they would equal the 
feat of Percy Chapman whose Englishmen crushed the West Indies in 
all the three Tests by an identical margin in 1928. However, what 
would make the Pakistanis a more proud team will be the point that 
Chapman's team beat the West Indies who were playing their 
inaugural series. On the contrary, Wasim Akram's men would be 
beating the Caribbeans who in the last two decades were considered 
as an unbeatable and invincible force.
    
Saqlain Mushtaq was the man who made things look so simple for the 
home side on a perfect batting track. He bowled with accuracy and 
controlled spin to keep the West Indies batsmen at bay. Even a 
world-class batsman like Brian Lara appeared to be dancing to 
Saqlain's tune before succumbing to the off-spinner for the second 
time in the match. Lara, who scored 37, finished the series scoring 
129 runs. He fell to the pacers four time and twice to Saqlain 
Mushtaq.
    
After getting Lara, there appeared no stopping Saqlain as he 
further added the wickets of Shivnarine Chanderpaul (16), Ronald 
Holder (5) and David Williams (2). This performance by Saqlain 
would certainly earn him the status of as effective a spinner as 
Mushtaq Ahmad and Shane Warne to grace the modern era. But Saqlain 
penetrated through the West Indies defences courtesy Waqar Younis 
who removed both the West Indies openers to become Pakistan's third 
leading wicket-taker with 238. He surpassed Abdul Qadir (236) and 
now stands behind Imran Khan (361) and Wasim Akram (330).
    
While Waqar Younis and Saqlain Mushtaq amused a handful crowd with 
classical bowling displays, Carl Hooper's whirlwind century was by 
no means less entertaining. Hooper slammed the most thundering of 
all centuries of the series when he reached his 100 from just 80 
balls with 14 blistering boundaries and three huge sixes. It was 
his eighth Test century and third against Pakistan.
    
Hooper's innings ended 10 balls later when a banana-like inswinger 
from Wasim Akram sent his middle-stump cart-wheeling. Hooper 
completely overshadowed Brian Lara in a third wicket partnership of 
121 runs in 100 minutes. In fact, when Hooper completed his century 
with a graceful straight drive for a boundary, the West Indies were 
167 for two.
    
Hooper, who is one of the most attractive and stylish batsmen 
today, was in a very punishing mood. His first 50 runs came from 48 
balls with eight boundaries and a six while he took just 32 balls 
for his second 50 runs that spiced six boundaries and three sixes.
    
Hooper, who was bowled on the first ball after final water break of 
the day, was ruthless against Mushtaq Ahmad when he struck the 
Pakistan leg-spinner for 47 runs, including seven boundaries. Azhar 
Mahmood also received a rough treatment from him to concede 32 runs 
from his three overs.
    
Earlier, Pakistan repeated the Rawalpindi Test story to be fired 
out for 427 after starting the day at 327. Pakistan, on Monday, 
lost their nine wickets for the addition of only 90 runs with four 
batsmen being adjudged leg before wickets.
    
In Rawalpindi also, Pakistan had collapsed from a 323-run third 
wicket partnership between Aamir Sohail (160) and Inzamamul Haq 
(177). This time, they slumped after Sohail's 160 and Ijaz's 151.
    
For Ijaz, who started the day at 127, it was his career-best knock 
that was laced with 15 boundaries and a six. Ijaz batted for a 
minute under seven hours and faced 337 balls. Mervyn Dillon, 
playing his third Test, was the wrecker-in-chief when he bowled a 
dream spell of 13.4-4-52-5 to finish with analysis of 29.4-4-111-5.
    
Dillon bowled with venom and fire to swing the old ball 
appreciably. He was, however, extremely lucky to get favorable leg 
before decisions against Inzamamul Haq (4) and Wasim Akram.
    
West Indies skipper Courtney Walsh ended up with four for 74. He 
now has 353 wickets in 96 Tests. Walsh may arrive in his country 
with his head down but when it will come to performance, he would 
be a very proud man after taking 14 wickets in the series with two 
five-wicket hauls.

<a name="paki">Pakistan whitewash West Indies</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Dec. 9: Pakistan did what other team wouldn't even dare to 
think of. They whitewashed the West Indies to become the first side 
since 1928 to humiliate the once powerhouse of cricket.
    
Pakistan won the third and final Test by 10 wickets with more than 
five sessions to spare. They took just 29 minutes to polish off the 
West Indies tail.
    
Pakistan were, however, denied their third consecutive innings 
victory when West Indies reached 212 after resuming on the 
penultimate day at 198 for seven and needing three more runs to 
make the home team bat again. That set Pakistan a target of 12 runs 
which they achieved in five overs with make-shift openers Azhar 
Mahmood alone scoring 13 and Mohammad Wasim remaining not out on 0.
    
West Indies, the former giants of Test cricket, were last 
whitewashed by Percy Chapman's Englishmen in their inaugural 
series. Karl Nunes was the West Indies captain.
    
The series win was also a personal triumph for Pakistan skipper 
Wasim Akram. Besides finding a place aside Chapman, he became only 
the third captain in 46-year Pakistan cricket history to lead the 
home team to a 3-0 victory.
    
Akram's mentor, Imran Khan, became the first captain to inflict a 
3-0 defeat at Kim Hughes' Australians in 1982-83. Eight years 
later, Imran's feat was equaled by Javed Miandad who defeated 
Martin Crowe's New Zealand by a similar margin in the 1990-91 
season. However, Akram was, nevertheless, thwarted of joining the 
world's greatest quartet of Kapil Dev, Sir Richard Hadlee, Ian 
Botham and Imran Khan in his home country. He failed to get the 
required 29 runs to complete 2,000 runs besides 300 Test wickets. 
The allrounder will now go in hunt for the needed runs in Africa 
where Pakistan play five Tests, three against South Africa and the 
rest against Zimbabwe, in three months time.
    
Akram, without a shadow of doubt, will now go into history books as 
one of the best and most successful Pakistan captains after Imran 
Khan, Javed Miandad, Mushtaq Mohammad and Salim Malik.
    
Akram, last year, became the first captain to win two Tests in 
England and six months later, led Pakistan to their first World 
Series Cup wins in 17 years in Australia. Akram was an equal 
contributor in Pakistan's third and final Test win besides Ijaz 
Ahmad (151), Man-of-the-Series Aamir Sohail (4, 160, 160) and Man-
of-the-Match Saqlain Mushtaq (nine for 80).
    
After claiming three wickets for 76 runs in the first innings, 
Akram added four wickets for 42 runs to finish with match figures 
of seven for 118 runs. His morning spell read 2.4-0-11-3. But Akram 
should consider himself lucky to have Mervyn Dillon caught behind. 
Television replays showed that Dillon's bat was no where near the 
ball but South African umpire Cyril Mitchley was convinced and gave 
him caught behind.
    
West Indies didn't play bat. In fact, we played better than them, 
an elated Akram, who attributed the history-making success to every 
individual of the team, said in a post-match conference.  They 
(West Indies) at times lacked motivation but it's not that they are 
a bad team. We didn't actually allow them to lift after winning the 
Peshawar Test, Akram said. It is a great moment for every member of 
the team because it is only the second time that the West Indies 
have been blanked out completely, the Pakistan captain added.
    
It has not been a very satisfying golden jubilee season because we 
lost to South Africa and failed to qualify for the final of the 
one-day tournament. But to bounce back from those setbacks is a 
great achievement itself. Now we aim at the Sharjah tournament and 
I am sure we will deliver the goods because the morale of the team 
is sky-high. but cricket is an unpredictable game and one should 
not forget that.
    
Akram believed that his success will help the Pakistan team a long 
way in performing well on the African safari. "The boys are 
confident and they have started to believe in themselves. I have 
always maintained that we have the most talented players in the 
world and the only missing element was consistency. I am glad that 
it (consistency) came at the right time. All credit to the team for 
putting up a great show, Akram said.
    
West Indies captain Courtney Walsh tried to put up a brave face but 
disappointment clearly reflected from his face. We lacked 
consistency. We didn't bat properly. The Pakistan batsmen showed 
more application than ours, he said.  We failed to bowl the 
Pakistan out twice while they dismissed us each time we went down 
there. They completely outplayed us, Walsh admitted, who was named 
as West Indies' Man-of-the-Series after claiming 14 wickets.

Pakistan's victory over the West Indies was mainly due to the 
mental toughness of the players. They rose to the occasion and 
delivered the goods despite being under pressure after earlier 
defeats. The batsmen were more disciplined, responsible and mature 
while the bowling attack had variety in it. Whether it be the fast 
bowlers, wrist-spinner or finger-spinner, all got wickets. The 
fielders extended full support to their bowlers by bringing off 
scintillating catches and effecting brilliant run-outs.
    
Here, coach Haroon Rasheed also needs a pat on his back for making 
their players realise how talented and brilliant they were. 
Coaching is not a professional job in Pakistan but his association 
with the junior team must have helped a lot in dealing with the 
players while pointing out their weakness and how they should be 
rectified.
    
It must be a moment of satisfaction for Haroon after his critics 
questioned his credentials. "Let the people judge for themselves 
about my contributions to the national team and Pakistan cricket," 
Haroon said in a brief statement.
    
All is well that ends well. Pakistan had a mixed domestic season 
but the bottom-line is that they concluded the season a high note 
and it is time that the cricket board should awarded the entire 
side for putting up a majestic performance.
