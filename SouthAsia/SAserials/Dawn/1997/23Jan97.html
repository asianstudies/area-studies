<a name="19ki">19 killed as bomb explodes outside Lahore court</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Intkhab Hanif

LAHORE, Jan 18: Nineteen people including Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan 
(SSP) chief Maulana Ziaur Rehman Farooqui, the photographer of a 
local newspaper and 13 policemen, were killed when a powerful bomb 
exploded inside the heavily guarded Sessions Court building on 
Saturday.
    
Maulana Ziaur Rehman's right-hand man, Maulana Azam Tariq, 
sustained serious injuries and doctors at the Mayo Hospital said 
his condition was critical.
    
The bomb went off as the two SSP leaders and four workers were 
brought to the Sessions Court in a police van from the Kot Lakhpat 
jail for the hearing of cases against them. The incident occurred a 
minute or two after noon, and created mayhem at the scene.
    
The dead included two SHOs and an ASI. Over 100 people were 
injured, many of them critically. Besides police functionaries, SSP 
workers who had gone there to greet their leaders were also caught 
and injured in the blast.
    
Among the injured were five photographers of local newspapers also 
who were taking pictures of the SSP leaders.  Several reporters had 
also gone there to cover the proceedings of cases against the SSP 
leaders and were standing nearby, but escaped unscathed.
    
The SSP leaders and their party workers were brought to the 
Sessions Court amidst extra ordinarily tight security for hearing 
of criminal cases against them. The workers were in another police 
truck and were unharmed because they had yet to be taken out of the 
vehicle.
    
Blood-soaked and crushed bodies lay scattered at the blast site. It 
was a grim, devastating scene. The city was stunned as news of the 
tragedy spread.
    
According to police, the bomb was planted in a motorcycle parked 
outside the window of the court room of the Additional Sessions 
Judge Khalid Mian. The bomb went off when the SSP leaders came near 
the motorcycle.
    
An official of the bomb disposal squad of the Civil Defence 
Organisation said it was a two kilo high explosive time device 
planted in the tool box of the motorcycle, whose registration 
number could not be ascertained.
 
The bomb exploded when the compound of the courts was guarded by 
heavily armed police belonging to several police stations.
    
The prisoners' trucks were escorted by 40 commandos and over 70 
officials of the Mobile Force who were led by the DSP Gulberg. 
Prior the arrival of the SSP leaders, policemen were seen checking 
people at random at the two entrance gates of the courts with bomb-
detection devices.  
   
At the time of the incident Judge Khalid Mian and some other 
colleagues were in a meeting with the District and Sessions Judge 
at the Aiwan-i-Adl, about 300 metres away, in their capacity as 
returning officers.
    
As Maulana Farooqui and Maulana Azam Tariq alighted from the truck, 
they were encircled by a heavily armed police posse and followers 
chanting slogans and showering rose petals on them. The workers had 
been waiting for the two leaders since morning.
    
The deafening noise of the blast was accompanied by a flash of 
light, and the entire place was filled with smoke and dust. This 
reporter who was present on the spot along with other journalists 
saw a screen of haze enveloping the spot where the SSP leaders, 
workers and police were present.
    
Litigants, lawyers and staff of the courts ran to save their lives. 
The window panes of almost all court rooms were broken. The court 
room of Judge Khalid Mian had its window and doors ripped apart. 
His three stenographers, Raza Shah, Anwar and Bashir Baloch, 
sustained minor injuries. Their hearing was affected.
    
When the smoke and dust cleared, this reporter saw mutilated bodies 
scattered near the court room. Maulana Farooqui had been killed on 
the spot and Maulana Azam Tariq was lying injured. He was brought 
to the verandah of the court room by two injured workers who also 
collapsed after taking a few steps.
    
Blood, limbs, shoes and other belongings of the injured and the 
dead and cameras of the photographers were spread all over the 
site. Many people lay injured, burnt by the blast. They were either 
unconscious or crying for help, with their clothes and limbs torn.
    
Several vehicles belonging to police and people, the prisoners 
truck in which the SSP leaders were brought to the courts, some 
motorcycles and bicycles were damaged.
    
After the initial confusion and fear, police and lawyers returned 
to shift the victims to hospitals, which were put on alert. Soon 
rescue teams of the civil defence, police and district 
administration reached the spot. The dead and the injured were 
taken to hospitals in police vans and hospitals and civil defence 
ambulances. Maulana Azam Tariq was shifted to hospital in a private 
car.
    
The Civil Defence bomb disposal squad also reached there and 
collected splinters of the bomb and samples of the wreckage of the 
motorcycle in which the device was apparently planted.
    
Among government officials, Lahore Division Commissioner Salman 
Siddique was the first to reach the scene and to supervise the 
rescue operation being conducted by a lone magistrate. He was 
followed by Deputy Commissioner Kamran Lashari, IGP Chaudhry 
Mohammad Amin and Lahore DIG Tariq Parvez. Lahore High Court Chief 
Justice Ejaz Nisar, provincial Chief Secretary Parvez Masood, Home 
Secretary Hafiz Akhtar also reached the spot soon after.

<a name="accu">Accused in Lahore blast confesses</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Jan 20: The suspect arrested by the police soon after 
Saturday's bomb blast at Sessions Court confessed to having carried 
out the explosion resulting in the death of 19 people, including 14 
policemen.
    
The accused is reported to have links with former Imamia Students 
Organisation chief late Dr Mohammad Ali Naqvi.
    
Lahore Range DIG Tariq Parvez told reporters at a Press conference 
that the bomb blast was masterminded by one Dr Qaisar Abbas, a 
close associate of Dr Mohammad Ali Naqvi who was still at large. 
The DIG said the accused, Mehram Ali, had been sentenced to 10 
years of imprisonment by a local court on possessing hand grenades 
and other explosive material in 1990. However, he was granted 
relief when he approached superior court and was subsequently 
released in 1994.
    
He said the accused belonged to Shia sect and wanted to kill SSP 
leader Maulana Azam Tariq who, according to Mehram Ali, spoke ill 
of Hazrat Ali and his family in his speeches and writings. He said 
the accused was exploring ways and means to eliminate the SSP 
leader since Mr Azam Tariq's stay in Rawalpindi and Multan jails.
    
The accused told police that he visited the sessions court on Jan 
4, the last date of Maulana Azam Tariq's appearance before the 
court. In view of the tight security measures taken by the police, 
Mehram Ali found it difficult to make Maulana Azam a bullet target. 
He discussed the security arrangements at the Sessions court with 
his new mentor Dr Qaisar Abbas and it was decided that a bomb blast 
should be carried out to accomplish the mission. Both of them 
visited sessions court on Jan 14 to select the spot to park the 
motorcycle implanted with explosive material. They planted ten 
blocks of explosive material, each weighing about one pound, in the 
fuel tank and space above its engine.
    
According to the DIG, Mehram Ali parked the motorcycle at the 
selected spot at about 7am on Saturday and waited for the arrival 
of the SSP leaders with remote control in his hand nearby. When SSP 
leaders Maulana Ziaur Rehman Farooqi and Maulana Azam Tariq reached 
the Sessions court, he became alert and stood only 40 or 50 yard 
from the bike. He pushed the button of the remote control device 
when the SSP leaders were passing close to the motorcycle. He later 
threw the wireless-shaped remote control on the roof of a nearby 
Bakhshikhana.
    
The DIG said the accused was about to slip out of the court 
premises when he was apprehended by three police constables posted 
there in connection with judicial checking. The wig used by the 
accused to conceal his identity supported the suspicion of police 
officials.
    
Initially, the DIG said, the accused tried to mislead the 
investigators by giving wrong name and address. Later, he revealed 
his exact name which was certified by the police record. He also 
revealed the address of the rented house near Angoori Cinema. A 
raid at the house led to the recovery of about two kg of explosive 
material, a wireless set and other tools used in the incident. The 
accused was also produced before newsmen.

<a name="fana">Fanatics could not harm ties with Iran, says Leghari</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

QUETTA, Jan 22: The President, Sardar Farooq Ahmed Khan Leghari, 
has said that Pakistan and Iran are enjoying very cordial relations 
and small groups of religious fanatics of the country and the 
Taliban could not harm those relations.
    
Addressing a news conference at the Governor's House, the President 
said "We have brotherly relations with Iran and consider them as 
our brothers."
    
He denied a suggestion from a newsman that Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq 
and other Muslim countries were involved in whipping up 
sectarianism in Pakistan. "They are not interfering in our internal 
affair," President Leghari emphatically declared. He regretted that 
the Iranian Cultural Centre was burnt down and said. "We will give 
adequate protection to all Iranians in Pakistan. Such incidents 
would not affect our cordial relations with Iran," President 
Leghari told the correspondent.
    
He said that Iran had some misgivings and apprehension in regard to 
Taliban, but those fears could not harm our brotherly relations 
with Iran.

<a name="alta">Altaf wants annulment of special courts Act</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 16: MQM chief Altaf Hussain said that the government's 
step of dissolving the special courts was a mere eyewash and was 
aimed at misleading the people.
    
In a statement, the MQM chief said neither the government had 
abrogated the 1975 act concerning the special courts, nor had the 
cases pending in these courts under the criminal procedure been 
transferred to the civil courts, but the session judges have been 
given the additional duties as special court to deal with these 
cases.
    
Mr Hussain said the government handout issued by the information 
department of the Government of Sindh has given an impression as if 
these courts had really been disbanded. "In fact, the special 
courts act approved in the 1975 is very much there despite the fact 
that the successive governments promised to abolish it," he said.
    
Mr Hussain said the Sindh government had not annulled or disbanded 
the special courts under Section 3(2), but in fact had given this 
task to the district and additional judges.
    
He said it was a wrong impression that the special courts have been 
abolished to give any relief to the MQM. "If the government is 
sincere in giving some relief, it should amend the law first".

<a name="publ">Publicise IMF pact: Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 16: Deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto demanded 
that the caretakers make public details of the agreement they had 
allegedly signed with the IMF.
    
Talking to newsmen at an Iftar party, she claimed that the 
caretaker government had agreed to bring down tariff from 65 to 35 
percent, which within the next three years, would prove to be 
detrimental to the national interest. She said she was not opposed 
to a reduction in tariff but said it should be done over a longer 
period otherwise competitiveness of the industry would be affected 
and the country would face a massive employment problem.
    
The former prime minister said the manner in which utility rates 
and prices of commodities were being raised, it appeared that the 
caretakers had accepted the IMF package which she had refused to 
accept.
    
She said during her meetings with the international donor agencies 
she had maintained that the method of achieving the target set for 
reducing the budget deficit should be left to the government. "It 
is unfair and unjust that elected Pakistani leaders cannot make 
their own budget and someone comes from Washington and give us a 
three-year package every now and then."

ISLAMABAD, Jan 18: Deposed prime minister Benazir Bhutto informed 
the Supreme Court that she will withdraw her petition challenging 
the dismissal of the National Assembly, if it were to delay the 
February 3 general election.
    
"If our petition were to delay the elections, I would step out (of 
court)," Ms Bhutto's counsel Aitzaz Ahsan told a seven-member bench 
of the Supreme Court hearing her petition.
 
The Bench on Saturday heard Dr Farooq Hasan, the counsel of the 
Mohajir Qaumi Movement, for more than half day on MQM's request for 
being allowed as intervener to the case. The request was opposed by 
Aitzaz Ahsan.

<a name="diss">Dissolution case hearing commences</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 19: A full Bench of the High Court of Sindh commenced 
hearing of the three petitions filed by the former chief minister 
and two ministers of the erstwhile Sindh cabinet.
    
Abdul Hafeez Lakho, appearing for the petitioners, while winding up 
his arguments referred to the case of Khwaja Tariq Rahim decided by 
the Supreme Court in 1992. He submitted that even if it were 
accepted that there was corruption, that alone could not justify 
the order of dissolution.
    
Mr Lakho further contended that as far as the killing of Murtaza 
Bhutto was concerned, till the passing of the order of dissolution 
no one had accused Abdullah Shah's involvement therein.
    
In any case hypothetically speaking even if he was accused that 
would not be a ground to dismiss the entire assembly.
    
Naimur Rahman, appearing for the governor of Sindh, informed the 
court that M. Farogh Naseem would commence arguments for the 
respondents and the government of Sindh and thereafter he would go 
through the material filed by the respondents.
    
Mr Naseem, in his address to the court, invited the attention of 
the Bench to the very basis and ethos of the exercise of power 
under Articles 58 (2) (B) and Article 112 (2) (b).
    
The counsel contended that these Articles contained a mechanism to 
avert an extra-constitutional deviation. He contended that the 
court has to interpret the present case in this context. He invited 
the attention of the court to the fact that like provisions were 
contained in the Government of India Act 1935, but not in the 
subsequent constitutions experienced and adopted by the country.
    
It was in view of lack of such provisions that the country had to 
face military interventions and extra-constitutional 
interference's.
    
Mr Naseem emphasised that the court has to acknowledge the fact 
that constitutional heads like the president and the governor 
cannot be silent spectators to witness the plunder and loot of 
public wealth and degeneration of public authorities. He said in 
case there is such a silence on the part of the constitutional 
heads and they are bereft of such powers then extra-constitutional 
interference's can be very much expected. He further emphasised 
that in case this was not done the constitutional crisis could 
transform into a dictatorial regime and the chance of democracy 
would be lost.
    
He emphasised the need for the court to decide constitutional 
questions in consonance with the aspirations of the people at 
large, since the very constitution has to suit the genius of the 
people.
    
He then invited the court's attention to the basis principles 
contained in the exercise of power under Article 58 (2) (b) and 
Article 112 (2) (b).
 
The counsel for the government of Sindh contended that if on a 
particular ground there were 200 documents and the court found only 
five or 10 to be relevant that was enough to sustain the 
dissolution order.

<a name="argu">Arguments continue in PA dissolution case</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 20: Mohammad Farogh Naseem, counsel for the government 
of Sindh, appearing in the dissolution of assembly cases before the 
High Court of Sindh on Monday said that the arguments of the 
counsel for the petitioners was based upon a misappropriation of 
facts and law.
    
Presenting his arguments before a full Bench of the High Court of 
Sindh, he said the counsel for the petitioners  erstwhile chief 
minister Syed Abdullah Shah and two of his cabinet ministers, Nisar 
A. Khuhro and Pir Mazharul Haq  had maintained that the Supreme 
Court in Haji Saifullah and Nawaz Sharif cases had struck down the 
presidential action of dissolution as illegal, in the present case 
also the order of the dissolution should be declared illegal.
 
He pointed out that the court should indulge itself into the 
exercise of judicial and constitutional interpretation to 
appreciate the real and correct import of these two decisions of 
the Supreme Court.
    
He pointed out that Hafeez Lakho had stated that in the Saifullah 
case the grounds of dismissal given by General Zia were so vague 
and that even subsequent material relied upon by the respondents 
was rejected.
    
He emphasised that on the contrary in the Haji Saifullah case no 
material was produced by the federal government to support the 
grounds of dissolution and it was due to the lack of production of 
material that the court declared the order of dissolution to be 
unconstitutional.
    
Mr Naseem pointed out that even in the subsequent decision of the 
High Court comprising five judges in the Khalid Malik case (matter 
pertaining to the dissolution of the Benazir government in 1990) 
the court had taken note of the fact that in Haji Saifullah case no 
material was produced and thus no parallel could have been drawn 
from it.
    
Barrister Farogh Naseem emphasised that the true import of Haji 
Saifullah case was that facts and circumstances of every case had 
to be looked into independently.
    
Commenting upon the Nawaz Sharif case, Mr Naseem contended that in 
the said Sharif case on April 17, 1993, president Ghulam Ishaque 
Khan dismissed Nawaz Sharif. He stated that in the Nawaz Sharif 
case the then attorney-general had conceded that the only and major 
dispute in the Nawaz Sharif case was whether the president could 
dismiss the prime minister because a speech challenging him had 
been made.
    
He said that in the present case no such parallel can be drawn. It 
was in view of this that even the Nawaz Sharif case was not 
applicable to the present controversy.
    
The counsel pointed out that the other grounds mentioned in Nawaz 
Sharif case were hardly common except for the ground of 
maladministration. He submitted that as far as the ground of mal- 
administration was concerned, the Federation in the case of Nawaz 
Sharif could not come up with any positive evidence.
    
He said there was corruption but there are levels of corruption. In 
the latter case, the president and the governor can dismiss the 
assembly on that ground alone.
    
He invited the court's attention to the aspect of individual and 
collective material responsibility of the state. Admittedly, where 
a person of the status of the brother of the prime minister dies as 
a result of police killing or ambush, the state affairs can well be 
imagined.
    
The chief justice also inquired of the counsel as to why the 
assembly was dissolved if only the government was found to be at 
fault, to which Farogh Naseem contended that the mechanism 
envisaged in the constitution is such that the assembly has to go 
if the government is at fault, while the court cannot supply any 
words in the regard.
    
The chief justice inquired of Mr Naseem as to how one man could 
restrict the life of a democratically elected assembly, to which 
Farogh Naseem contended that it was quite possible for an assembly 
to lose its mandate even before the time for which it was elected. 
He pointed out that in 1988 Mr Junejo's government was dissolved 
but he was not elected in 1990. Similarly, Benazir Bhutto was 
dismissed and thereafter she was not elected but Nawaz Sharif was 
elected. Similarly, after Nawaz Sharif's government dismissal, he 
was not elected but Benzair Bhutto was elected. These events 
confirmed that the people had lost confidence in the respective 
governments even before the full term of the assembly could expire.
    
At this the CJ said that a very strict interpretation should be 
given to Articles 58 (2) (b) and 112 (2) (b), to which Mr Naseem 
replied that this was not correct since after the exercise of power 
under Articles 58 (2)(b) by the president/government a one-man rule 
was not being imposed. On the contrary, the political sovereign, 
that is, the electorate was to express a further opinion, thereby 
ensuring a better accountability in democratic traditions.
    
He also said the courts while deciding constitutional cases should 
afford such opinions which would be in consonance with the 
aspirations of the people since the decisions in constitutional 
cases are to be construed as part of the constitution and the 
constitution is to suit the genius of the people.

<a name="aitz">Aitzaz terms rejoinder false</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 20: Counsel for former prime minister Benazir Bhutto 
informed the Supreme Court that President Farooq Leghari had 
submitted fictitious documents along with his reply and asserted 
that the court cannot look into such concocted documents.
    
Resuming his arguments before a seven-member bench of the Supreme 
Court against the dissolution of the assembly and dismissal of PPP 
government, Aitzaz Ahsan mentioned a particular letter submitted by 
President Farooq Leghari written on Nov. 13, 1995 regarding an 
incident which occurred on Nov. 21. Another document had a date of 
Nov. 8 but related to an incident which occurred on Nov. 15.
    
The rejoinder pointed out the false charges and documents proved by 
the president in the court specially the one in which he had 
claimed that a company, in which Asif Zardari's brother-in-law held 
an interest, was illegally allotted land by the Capital Development 
Authority.
    
"The person referred to by the supporting documentation, Mir 
Munawwar Ali, is not Zardari's brother-in-law (Mir Munawwar Ali 
Talpur) but some one else," it said adding that only the names were 
similar. "The mere fact that the prime minister's spouse brother-
in- law's name is similar to that of the alleged wrong-doer 
presumably does not justify the dissolution of the National 
Assembly."
    
Referring to another document allegedly signed by Nahid Khan 
recommending employment for some one, the rejoinder said the letter 
on which the president had relied was a forged document and the 
criminals involved in forgery was currently being prosecuted.
    
The petitioner's counsel went through 276 pages out of 5,000 to 
establish that these documents had no nexus with the dissolution of 
the assembly. Majority of these letters were lifted from the MQM's 
booklet "Genocide of Mohajir Community" which MQM had been 
distributing at international forums.
    
Some documents pertained to the reports of the Amnesty 
International and Asia Watch, the human rights groups, on the 
situation in Karachi. In these documents, while these human rights 
organisations had expressed their concern over killings in Karachi, 
they had also mentioned the killings of innocent citizens by 
terrorists.
    
The petitioner's counsel said the Amnesty International report 
pertained to 1995 when the conditions were not good. However, he 
said the report itself mentions that armed groups were involved in 
torture and kidnappings. "This report was released in August 1995. 
*From August 1995 to November 1996 he (the president) never wrote to 
the government that it had failed to save the citizens from 
targeted killings of armed groups. "And what are these armed 
opposition groups?" he asked and explained this was reference to 
MQM factions. He said the same report had also referred to the 
killings of innocent citizens and mentioned that mutilated bodies 
were found dump in many parts of the city.
    
Aitzaz said most of the documents attached were mischief documents 
which are published by the non-governmental organisations to 
blackmail the government and get foreign aid. "If you have to 
dissolve the assembly on such reports then where is the sovereignty 
of the parliament?"
    
He said the NGOs was a big racket and some people, who were 
provided aid, were deputed from abroad to prepare such documents 
which were not trust worthy.
    
Another document, he mentioned, was sent to the president on Nov. 
13, 1995. The petitioner's counsel asked why the president slept 
over the document and took no action from 1995 to 1996.
    
The Chief Justice told him that the court did not have to solely 
rely on these documents while deciding the case. "This may be one 
of the documents in support," he noted and advised the petitioner's 
counsel just to tell the court whether any document was helpful to 
the president in forming his opinion or not.
    
He said basically all the documents submitted by the president were 
un-signed documents. Aitzaz said these were un-substantiated 
allegations and quoted a full court decision in Nawaz Sharif case 
in which Justice Shafiur Rehman had held that unsubstantiated 
documents could hardly be sustained. The judge had noted that if 
such unsubstantiated were allowed to be entertained no government 
or assembly would stay more than few months.
    
Many of the documents are newspaper clippings and articles written 
by different people. Aitzaz quoting the same full-court decision 
said the court had held that mere allegations in form of complaints 
or news reports were insufficient for dissolving the National 
Assembly.
    
He contended that most of the material produced in the court by the 
president was not available to him before or at the time of the 
dissolution of the assembly. Had it been available to him, he would 
have written letters to the government but he never took any 
action.
    
At this stage Khalid Anwar, who is representing the president, said 
that there was massive material. He said one could not expect that 
the president would dissolve the assembly only a day after 
receiving the material.
    
The Chief Justice said that the court had understood his point that 
the president was part and parcel of the government and he did not 
protest at that time if any material was before him.
 
Aitzaz Ahsan said it was strange of the president that he was 
questioning the government for bringing the Rangers to Karachi for 
restoring peace. "If we allow terrorism the government is dissolved 
for failing to combat terrorism and if we combat terrorism we are 
questioned why the government was combating terrorism?"
    
Quoting Nawaz Sharif judgment, he said, mere allegations could not 
be considered a valid piece of evidence and recalled that there 
were allegations of corruption of billions of rupees against Nawaz 
Sharif but the court had not accepted those charges.
    
"My case is much better than Nawaz Sharif. He (Nawaz Sharif) said 
in his speech that the president should be lynched. But the 
speeches, I am charged with, were nothing compared to that," he 
said indirectly referring to the charge of the president that 
Benazir Bhutto had ridiculed the judiciary in her speeches. He said 
irrelevant documents had been attached by the president and 
referred to a writ petition submitted by the president which was 
decided even before the PPP came into power.
    
Earlier, when the court resumed hearing, Aitzaz took strong 
exception to the language used by President Farooq Leghari against 
Benazir Bhutto in his reply and said that several portions of his 
statement were "unpardonable".
    
Aitzaz said the president had not written any letter to the prime 
minister complaining about the extra-judicial killings in Karachi. 
"Charges of custodial killings are baseless." He said the president 
had time and again publicly stated that peace had been restored in 
Karachi and requested the court not to go into each case of 
custodial killing.
    
Aitzaz said there may be some high-handedness by the police but any 
wrong-doing of police cannot be contributed to the prime minister 
every time. "Ground of mishandling by police cannot be made a 
ground for dissolution of the assembly."

<a name="mirh">Mir had named conspirators hours before he was killed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied 

KARACHI, Jan 18: Mir Murtaza Bhutto in his last public address 
hours before he was killed in police action had named the people 
who had been conspiring against him and they were Asif Ali Zardari, 
Syed Abdullah Shah, the director-general of Intelligence Bureau, 
Masood Sharif, the deputy inspector-general of police, Karachi 
Range, Dr Shoaib Suddle; and the then SSP South, Wajid Ali Durrani.
    
At a public meeting held in Surjani Town arranged by Maqbool Channa 
and members of the minority community, Murtaza Bhutto had named 
these people as those who were conspiring against him and others 
whose names have been mentioned in the last FIR lodged by one of 
the party supporter, Noor Mohammad.
    
Abdullah Baloch, a member of the executive committee of PPP (SB), 
on Saturday testified before the three-member judicial tribunal 
inquiring into the causes of the death of Mir Murtaza and seven of 
his men on September 20, 1996. The tribunal comprises Justice Nasir 
Aslam Zahid, judge of the Supreme Court; Justice Amanullah Abbasi, 
and Justice (Dr) Ghous Mohammad, judges of the High Court of Sindh.
    
The witness said the tape-recordings of the event are available 
with him in which Mir Murtaza had also said that if the authorities 
wanted him, they only have to produce a proper warrant of arrest 
and that he was ready to go with them, irrespective of the fact 
from what level of authority the orders have come from.
    
Mr Baloch, a founder member of the PPP-SB  said that Surjani Town 
meeting was organised by the local organisers and he was one of the 
speakers at the meeting. Others who spoke were Ashiq Hussain Jatoi, 
president Sindh PPP (SB); Malik Bagh, divisional president, and 
many others.
    
Q: What time the meeting concluded at Surjani Town?
    
A: at About 8:00 or 8:15 pm and from there I left for my home in 
Old Golimar. I received a phone call from 70- Clifton at about 9 pm 
or 9:15 pm, saying that the party chief and his men have been 
attacked by the police and he (Murtaza) has been taken to Mideast 
Medical Centre. My law office is next to my house and the message 
was received by my children. Then I rushed to 70-Clifton and from 
there to the hospital.
    
Q: What did Mr Bhatti tell you about the incident?
    
A: I was informed that a police party had attacked the motor 
cavalcade and being legally minded persons, we should look for an 
eyewitness to the incident and lodge a report with the police. We 
found Noor Mohammad there who was with Murtaza at the public 
meeting. 
    
Q: Did you go to the police station?
    
A: We took Noor Mohammad and went to Clifton police station to 
lodge the report but the police refused to entertain our complaint, 
saying that they have no instructions from their seniors.
    
Q: On the next morning did you go to see the place of the incident?
    
A: Yes. But there was no signs of what had happened during the last 
few hours. Everything was cleaned up and there was no motor 
vehicles around the place.
    
Q: Since when you knew Murtaza?
    
A: When he returned to Pakistan and when he was appearing before 
the courts here.
    
Q: Did Mir Murtaza mention at any time at party meetings that he is 
having opposition from any political opponents?
    
A: He did not name any party by name but he always used to condemn 
Asif Zardari for his corrupt practices he was involved in.
    
Q: Did he ever mention any danger to his life from foreign 
elements?
    
A: No.
    
Q: Did your party try to evaluate people around the party to see 
whether any of them were RAW agents?
    
A: Mir Murtaza was always of the view that allegations had been 
made that there were RAW agents in his party and that these 
allegations were made by the government of Benazir Bhutto. If the 
allegations had any basis, Mir Murtaza was of the view that the 
government should charge them for the offences in the courts.
 
The next witness was Dr Zahid Hussain Jatoi, a medical doctor and a 
landlord, younger brother of Ashiq Hussain Jatoi, who had been 
killed in the incident.
    
He started his evidence by mentioning that Ashiq Jatoi was afraid 
of Durrani, who was the SP of Dadu in 1984, because at that time a 
gambling den was being operated with the connivance of the SP. My 
brother complained to the then martial law authorities and the 
place was raided on the orders of Brig Salim.
    
We brothers were called by the SP of Dadu at that time and he was 
very rude to us because my brother had made a complaint to the 
brigadier. Durrani had said they should have told him about it 
rather than going to the brigadier. My brother had told him about 
the den but he did not listen to him. Since then the SP used to 
threaten us and in Karachi as the SSP (South) he used to threaten 
him on trivial matters.
    
A day before the incident of Sept 20, SSP Durrani rang up 70- 
Clifton and wanted to speak to Mir Murtaza and he refused, he then 
talked to Ashiq. During that conversation, he threatened us for the 
bomb blasts that had occurred in Karachi three days earlier. He 
wanted to involve us in the bomb blast case, to which Ashique said 
we have nothing to do with it. Dr Zahid Jatoi, narrated the alleged 
sufferings of the family at the hands of the police for not giving 
them information about Ashiq Jatoi after the firing.
    
>From 9 pm onwards and until 3:30 am of the next morning we were not 
told of the whereabouts of Ashiq Jatoi. He was not traceable in an 
injured condition in any of the hospitals nor his body was 
available in any of the mortuaries. We had been running from place 
to place and nobody gave us any information, until at 3:30 am or 
even later, six bodies arrived at the JPMC mortuary, and his 
brother's body was one of them.
    
The family had searched for him at JPMC and AKUH and we had no 
access to the police stations and or the place of the incident, as 
these were out of bounds for us, although through the courtesy of 
Dr Abdul Ghaffar Jatoi and the DC (South), the search was made and 
each time we were told there is no trace of him.
    
Several persons went to the JPMC mortuary and to the emergency ward 
to look for him, but each time they returned without any 
information. It was for the first time that Asghar Ali, the 
personal attendant of Mir Murtaza when he was brought to JPMC, told 
me with tears in his eyes that Murtaza had been killed and my 
brother was seriously injured. That was the first specific 
information about Ashiq Jatoi.
    
I also saw Dr Mazhar Memon, another injured man from the same 
place, but he was not aware of Ashique. During these hectic and 
agonising period, my wife had been searching for my brother at AKUH 
and MEMC, but to no avail. At AKUH, she found ASP Shahid Hayat who 
had been taken there.
    
Finally, when the bodies had been taken to the mortuary of JPMC, 
there was no electricity and the mortuary was closed and I got it 
opened with the courtesy of a doctor friend, Salim Kharal, but the 
bodies were not there.
    
At 3:30 am the DC confirmed that the bodies were sent to JPMC, then 
all of us went there. I remained seated in the car and did not have 
the courage to enter the mortuary and identify the body of my 
brother. The identification was done by my driver and other 
relatives, including Dr Salim Kharal, who was known to me, and we 
were together in the same medical college. Then I went home to 
inform my parents.
    
I returned at 4:30 am when sub-inspector Khurram Waris of Clifton 
PS arrived with police papers and he deeply regretted the incident, 
describing the action as a black spot for the police and it was the 
result of the action taken by the senior officers.
    
The sub-inspector offered to help me in any way possible. I then 
asked him to locate the driver of my brother.
    
At the mortuary, the MLOs and SI Khurram Waris also took my 
signatures for handing over of the body.
    
Tribunal: Where were the bodies for six hours, they were either at 
the police station or on the scene of the incident?
    
Witness: I was not even allowed to go to the two police stations 
and the scene of the incident in search of my brother. I don't have 
a complete answer to this question.
    
On the orders of the special court, the police returned the wrist-
watch and Rs 400 which were on the person of Ashiq Jatoi (Dec. 2). 
A gold ring and a chain in his neck were missing which were not 
returned given, and when I inquired of the police, they said some 
"Haram Khor" (dishonest parasite person) has taken away.
    
The blue Pajero jeep which he (Ashiq) was driving with Mir Murtaza 
was also returned by the police minus a tape-recorder, a console 
box with a radio. An FIR was lodged with the police against them 
for stealing but the things have not been recovered so far.
    
Dr Jatoi will appear again on Jan 21 to answer questions from 
Khawaja Sharful Islam, counsel for Wajid Ali Durrani.
    
The third and last witness of the day was ASI Badar Alam, son of 
former SSP Khurshid Alam, whose services are placed with the 
Services and General Administration Department, government of 
Sindh.
    
The 26-year-old witness said he took the six bodies in three 
ambulances and handed them over to another police officer at JPMC 
and returned. For full night, he was not aware what was happening 
around him, he did not talk to anybody, didn't hear anything and 
saw nothing about the incident.
    
A tribunal member, Justice (Dr) Ghous Mohammad, described him as a 
patent liar. Working at the Clifton PS on the day of the incident 
he was not aware about it and who were involved and what happened 
until the next day. He had not made entries in the "Roznamcha" 
about his entry into the police station on duty and there was again 
no entry made when he left. He did not also made entries in the 
daily entries register when he took the six bodies to the hospital 
and neither it was entered that he was back from the hospital.
    
According to the "Roznamcha" and the entries made, he was not on 
duty and that he should be marked absent from duty on that date, 
the tribunal remarked.
    
The ASI when asked by the tribunal said he was making case diaries 
of old cases that night.
    
When he was asked if he can produce anyone of them from the police 
station right then and he should go in a police mobile in the 
company of PDSP Shamim Husain, police liaison officer, to which he 
had no answer.
    
The chairman of the tribunal observed that "we must make a 
recommendation that you should not be allowed to continue any 
longer as a police officer."
    
One of the counsel suggested that he was not at the police station, 
he didn't go to the hospital with the bodies and with a mala fide 
intention had given wrong information or he was suppressing facts.
    
According to the witness, there are 21 officers, 115 men and three 
mobiles in the jurisdiction of the Clifton police station.
    
The tribunal adjourned the hearing of the witnesses of Murtaza's 
party nominees on point of conspiracy, after the evidence of 
Abdullah Baloch and Dr Zahid Hussain Jatoi.

<a name="anon">Anonymous fax showed plot to eliminate politicians</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
H. A. Hamied 

KARACHI, Jan 20: Testifying before the Murtaza murder case 
tribunal, a leader of the PPP (SB) disclosed the existence of a 
telefax message which was being circulated at the highest levels, 
disclosing conspiracies involving several important personalities 
of the country, including the then prime minister, her brother 
Murtaza Bhutto, Masood Sharif and Chaudhry Shujaat etc.
    
Dr Altaf Hussain Khawaja, a deputy Secretary-General of PPP (SB), 
made the disclosure about the fax and the first-ever meeting that 
took place in July last year between the prime minister and her 
brother.
    
Dr Khawaja disclosed that there was a conspiracy to eliminate the 
top leadership of the PML, including the Chaudhry brothers, and 
that these decisions were taken at a meeting between the prime 
minister and her brother, Mir Murtaza, sometimes in July last year.
    
The information was contained in a telefax message received by Mir 
Murtaza from his boyhood friend, Nagib Zaffar, in Islamabad. He was 
given that fax by Ms Rukhshana Bangash, who was then working in the 
Prime Minister's Secretariat. The fax was given to her by the prime 
minister and finally landed in Karachi in the hands of Murtaza 
through Mr Zaffar.
 
According to the fax, Mir Murtaza was paid for and accordingly a 
hit squad of 10 was formed and one of them was Sajjad Jakhro, whose 
name was elaborated in detail.
    
Answering a question from the tribunal, the witness said the prime 
minister got the fax from the Military Intelligence and it was 
generated by the MI and given to the PM and she gave it to Rukhsana 
and through Nagib it reached Mir Murtaza.
    
Masood Sharif, the then director-general of the Intelligence 
Bureau, who was close to the then prime minister, paid Jakhro Rs 
2.5 million to eliminate one of the Chaudhry brothers, and in the 
deal, one of Jakhro's men was released from jail, Dr Khwaja said.
    
The witness went to Murtaza saying that the Chaudhrys are fearing 
that you might be eliminating them and that Sajjad Hyder Jakhro was 
recruited by the IB to eliminate the PML leadership. In this fax, 
the PM and Murtaza were together being involved.
 
Mir Murtaza told me at a meeting that this kind of allegations are 
being made involving our own man, Sajjad Jakhro, (who was also 
killed in the Clifton incident) in the conspiracy.
    
Murtaza told me that there was nothing like this and we can send 
Sajjad to them to clarify the position. The difference between 
Chaudhry Shujaat and the fax message was that Sajjad Jakhro is 
being recruited for this purpose by the IB and the fax says that 
the prime minister and Murtaza are plotting the murders.
    
Masood Sharif, a close friend of the then prime minister, wanted 
that Murtaza be still branded as a terrorist and the Military 
Intelligence wanted that they (PM and Murtaza) should not get 
together.
    
The witness further said there was a conspiracy to murder the then 
prime minister and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, and (V. A.) 
Jaffery, and Ali Sonara was named as the conspirator.
 
Ali Sonara was arrested in the early morning of September 17, 1997 
on the charge of two bomb blasts in Karachi, which occurred 24 
hours later and he was arrested a day before the blasts, which 
suggests a deep-rooted conspiracy.
    
Q: Have you seen the fax sent by Nagib Zaffar?
    
A: Yes. A copy of the fax was seen by me which did not say who had 
sent it to whom. It was merely a report floated by the official 
agencies.
    
Q: You said the fax is with the police?
    
A: Ishaque Khakwani, deputy secretary of the party for Punjab, had 
sent a copy to the police along with his statement under Section 
161 CrPC in the murder case. Khakwani might be having copies, and 
perhaps Nagib Zaffar is also having a copy with him.
    
Later, the tribunal heard three witnesses from the police who were 
called for verification of certain points.

<a name="sate">Satellite services: PTCL clarification</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 15: A spokesman of the Pakistan Telecommunication 
Company Limited(PTCL) has clarified the Dawn's January 14 and 12 
reports that it has signed any contract for providing Satellite 
Services in Pakistan, or decided to retrench its 20,000 employees.
    
The spokesman said in the case of the PanAmSat contract it was not 
the PTCL but probably Pakistan Telecommunications Authority which 
is the regulatory body dealing with communications services.
    
He said that the PTCL was an operating company and issuing of 
licences for operating any telecommunication services does not fall 
under its purview. The regulatory body for issuance of such 
licences in Pakistan is Pakistan Telecom Authority(PTA) and not the 
PTCL.
 
Our Staff Correspondent from Washington adds: The PTCL spokesman is 
right as the name of the organisation which has signed the contract 
with PanAmSat is Pakistan Telecommunications Authority and not 
PTCL, as inadvertently reported. PanAmSat has in turn signed 
contracts with Pakistani firms Acsys Ltd, Comstar-ISA and Fascom 
Systems.
    
Likewise, the spokesman said that there the PTCL was not 
considering any proposal to retrench its 20,000 employees. He said 
that the PTCL was a growing organisation and was making substantial 
additions to its network every year. In a situation like this, the 
question of large scale reduction of staff does not arise. He 
stated that the terms and conditions of PTCL employees are fully 
protected under the Pakistan Telecommunication (RE-organisation) 
Act, 1996 and Service Regulation introduced last year. As such 
their services cannot be terminated arbitrarily.
    
However, the spokesman did not say a word about the circular issued 
by the PTCL on Dec. 16 (office memo No.E.30-10-96) for abolishing 
726 posts on the basis of which a plan has been made on the 
instructions of the caretakers to remove 17,000 to 20,000 
employees. The circular seeking abolishing 726 posts from grade one 
to grade 18 has been held in abeyance for two weeks by another 
circular following large scale protests and surrounding of the 
office of the new PTCL chairman Nasim Mirza recently.

<a name="khat">Khattak wants govt not to cancel SPTV licence</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Jan 20: Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Muhammad 
Abbas Khattak has requested the caretakers not to cancel the 
license of Shaheen-Pay TV (SPTV) insisting that it would not only 
have a serious negative fallout on Shaheen Foundation, but would 
also send wrong signals to foreign investors.
 
The air chief made this request to the government through a letter 
addressed to the additional secretary in-charge, ministry of 
information, Abu Shamim Ariff.
    
In his letter dated January 2, Khattak said that if the previous 
government had granted the licence in total disregard to laid down 
procedures, Shaheen Foundation cannot be blamed for that nor should 
it be made to suffer at this stage of the enterprise.
    
He asked Ariff to bring these points to the knowledge of the 
cabinet and added, "I am confident that no rash decision would be 
taken which might have negative repercussions later."
    
Khattak wrote this letter in response to government's intimation to 
him that the licence of the SPTV might be cancelled. The caretakers 
contacted him because Khattak had also written a letter to former 
prime minister Benazir Bhutto requesting her to grant permission to 
run a local channel to augment FM transmission with AM radio 
stations for 'external projection'.
    
In his latest letter, the air chief said that Shaheen Foundation 
(SF) entered into a joint venture agreement with Pay TV only 
because the project, besides being economically viable, fitted 
ideally into the business plan of SF as it promised to provide many 
jobs to retired PAF technicians and officers.
    
The SPTV, he said, has since set up a fairly large infrastructure 
at major cities in Pakistan, has acquired a transponder on Asia Sat 
II and has entered into agreements with several overseas 
broadcasters/programme distributors.
    
According to Khattak, over 50,000 households have bought LNB 
receivers for SPTV MMDs broadcasts.
    
Khattak believes that the cancellation of licence will affect the 
SF in following ways: a large amount of welfare funds that have 
been invested and were expected to begin giving returns from this 
year onwards would be wiped out; job opportunities for over 100 
retired PAF personnel would dry up; the confidence of foreign 
joint-venture partners in our other projects like Aircraft 
Maintenance and Overhaul Depot and Shaheen Air Lines would be 
undermined; and SF would be shunned by foreign investors as our 
credibility could receive a serious blow.
    
He added, "The cancellation of the project whose 50 percent 
shareholding is that of foreign investor would also send negative 
signals to other prospective investors. Similarly, non- performance 
of SPTV contracts with Asia Sat and other foreign companies would 
give adverse publicity to Pakistan's investment climate. Moreover, 
one of the ministers of the caretaker government has already filed 
a case in the apex court against SPTV and a unilateral decision by 
the government in a case which is subjudice would cast aspersions 
on the intentions of the government and would be construed as 
personal vendetta."
    
He urged the government to view the role of SPTV in the larger 
strategic plan as it is also airing Pakistan's viewpoint in Europe. 
"Therefore, it may be appropriate to allow SPTV to present its 
future vision and strategic plan to the policy planners, before any 
decision is taken."

<a name="gdpg">GDP grows at 5% in first three years</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haq

ISLAMABAD, Jan 20: The mid-plan review of the Eighth five-year Plan 
(1993-98), released on Monday presents a dismal picture of the 
economy which remained well below the target at the aggregate 
level, but admits that GDP grew at the rate of 5 percent and 
agriculture sector registering a growth rate of 5.9 percent.
    
However the mid-review expressed concern over the manufacturing 
sector, whose growth rate fell below to 4.5 percent against the 
target of 9.9 per cent. The large-scale manufacturing grew at the 
rate of only 2.6 per cent compared to the plan target of 10.5 
percent partly due to delay in the completion of new projects which 
were envisaged to enhance the productive capacity of the 
manufacturing sector and partly due to unsatisfactory law and order 
situation in the country.
    
The performance on the investment front has not been very 
encouraging. The total fixed investment of Rs 255.7 billion in 
1993-94, Rs 260.1 billion in 1994-95 and Rs 294.0 billion in 1995-
96 at 1992-93 prices have been below their respective targets of Rs 
276.3 billion, Rs 304.5 billion and Rs 338.0 billion. Moreover, the 
sectoral composition of investment has not been consistent with the 
priorities laid down in the Plan, especially in the private sector, 
for example in energy sector investment target of Rs 49.5 billion 
(in 1992-93) was envisaged during 1993-96, whereas actual 
investment amounted only to Rs 17.1 billion. Similarly, Rs 19.6 
billion worth of investment has been made in transport and 
communications sector against the target of 74.3 billion. However, 
services and ownership of dwellings sector witnessed an achievement 
of 138 percent and 116 percent respectively.
    
Against the Eight Plan private sector investment target of Rs 948.4 
billion (1992-93 prices), the actual achievement during the first 
three years of the Plan amounted to Rs 439.8 billion (1992-93) 
prices showing an achievement of 46.4 per cent of the Eight Plan 
target. This achievement was un-evenly spread across the sectors. 
In the energy sector, about 13.2 percent of the investment target 
was met in 1993-94; there has been a rather significant increase in 
investment in the energy sector. A significant achievement has been 
recorded in the services (100.1 percent) and ownership of dwellings 
(77.8 percent). In the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, the 
achievement has been recorded at 58.7 percent and 54.2 percent of 
the Eighth Plan target respectively. As proportion of GDP however, 
the private investment decreased from 10.0 percent in 1992-93 to 
9.4 percent in 1994-95 (1992-93 prices) but improved again to 10.7 
percent in 1995-96.
    
To attract the prospective investors, both within and outside the 
country, a number of incentives and policy reforms were introduced. 
Almost all areas of economic activity were opened to the private 
sector. The government has resorted to privatisation of the state-
owned enterprises and financial institutions and so far 89 
enterprises, including banks, have been privatised. Against the 
Eighth Plan target of Rs 130.1 billion in 1993-94, Rs 132.3 billion 
in 1994-95 and Rs 148.9 billion in 1995-96, public sector 
investment was Rs 117.5 billion, Rs 123.9 billion and Rs 128.6 
billion respectively. Thus in the first three years of the Eighth 
Plan, the public sector fixed investment stood at Rs 370.0 billion 
showing an achievement of 49.4 percent.
    
FISCAL POLICY: The overall fiscal performance during the first 
three years of the Eight Plan indicates that total revenues 
(including SAP financing) of Rs 755.4 billion (1992-93 prices) were 
17.3 per cent of the GDP compared to the target of 19.8 per cent 
for the entire plan period of five years. Likewise, the total 
expenditure of Rs 1015.6 billion (1992-93 prices) was 23.2 per cent 
of GDP as against the Eight Plan target of 24.8 per cent. This 
reduction of 1.6 per cent of GDP in total expenditure had been due 
to reductions of 0.4 per cent in current expenditure and 1.2 per 
cent in development expenditure. On this basis, the overall fiscal 
deficit registered a decline from 8.0 per cent of GDP in 1992-93 to 
an average of 5.9 per cent of GDP during the first three years of 
the Plan, with achievements of 5.9 per cent, 5.6 per cent and 6.3 
per cent in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96 respectively. The 
government has thus succeeded in bringing about a significant 
improvement in fiscal management during the period under review.
    
MONETARY POLICY: The strategy of restraining monetary expansion to 
12.0 per cent per annum so as to reduce inflationary pressure while 
at the same time catering to the credit needs of the private sector 
was carried out during the Plan period. However, the government was 
unable to restrict the growth of monetary expansion to the Plan 
target. Money supply grew at an average rate of 16.1 per cent 
during the period, which though showing a steep fall from the 
benchmark, far exceeds the Plan target as well as much higher than 
the real growth of the economy, thereby increasing the inflationary 
gap. However, the actual monetary expansion during 1995-96 was 
achieved at the rate 14.91 per cent, compared to 18.0 per cent in 
the benchmark 1992-93.
    
Domestic credit increased to Rs 299.7 billion compared to a target 
of Rs 236.6 billion, showing an annual average growth rate of 26.7 
per cent. However, the government sector credit expanded by 30.8 
per cent higher than the target i.e. Rs 98.6 billion against the 
target of Rs 75.4 billion. Credit to private sector including 
credit to public sector commercial corporations, was 7.5 per cent 
higher than the level of the targets for the three years of the 
Plan.
    
PRICES: The Eighth Plan envisaged to bring the rate of inflation 
down from 9.3 per cent to 6.5 per cent by the end of the Plan 
period. However, during the first three years of the Plan, the 
inflation rate accelerated to 11.2 per cent, 13.0 per cent and 10.8 
per cent respectively. Thus the average for three years was around 
11.7 per cent. The basic cause of the inflation has been supply 
bottlenecks and higher money supply than targeted.
    
Foreign Trade and Payments: The implementation of Eighth Plan 
coincided with radical changes in global economy, necessitating 
host of new reforms and adjustment in domestic policies. All these 
unforeseen developments had far reaching effects on Pakistan's 
balance of payments position.
    
During  the first three years of the Plan, several fundamental 
reforms were launched in the external sector of the economy. Under 
the managed floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate has 
been brought close to its equilibrium value. Restrictions on 
foreign exchange transactions and keeping foreign exchange accounts 
in the country have been removed completely. Imports have been 
considerably liberalised. The maximum tariff ceiling on imports has 
been reduced to 65 per cent. Negative and restricted lists of 
imports were reduced to only those items which are justified on 
security, religious and social considerations. In short, under the 
Plan, Pakistan's economy has been opened and plugged into the world 
market.
    
The exports (f.o.b.) during the first three years increased, on an 
average, by 8.9 per cent per annum against the target of 12.5 
percent in nominal dollar terms while the imports (f.o.b.) rose by 
7.1 percent per annum as compared to the target of 7.5 percent; the 
cumulative deficit in the trade account surpassed the Plan target 
by 70.2 percent. As a result of improvement in invisibles account, 
the current account deficit was contained at 4.8 percent of GDP 
against the target of 3.9 percent of GDP.

<a name="sbpg">SBP given further autonomy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 21; The Federal Government promulgated on Tuesday 
three ordinances to amend the Bank Nationalisation Act 1974, 
Banking Companies Ordinance 1962 and State Bank of Pakistan Act 
1956.
    
Enforced after considerable delay, these ordinances provide legal 
cover to the financial sector reforms spelt out in detail by 
President Farooq Leghari in his December 25 speech. These reforms 
aim at providing greater autonomy to the State Bank of Pakistan to 
ensure monetary stability and financial soundness, government's 
consultation with State Bank Governor on appointment of presidents 
and chairmen of board of directors of the banks.
    
The State Bank has also been vested with authority to provide 
necessary guidance in relation to activities which could have 
implications for the monetary or credit policies of the Central 
Bank to institutions including ICP, NIT, HBFC, NDFC, BEL, Pak-Libya 
Holding Company, PICIC Saudi Pak Industrial and Agricultural 
Investment Company Limited, SBFC, RDFC, investment finance 
companies, venture capital companies and such more companies which 
carry out banking business. However, leasing companies and 
Modarabas have been exempted from the application of the provisions 
of the ordinance.
    
The Central Board of State Bank will henceforth formulate and 
monitor monetary and credit policy after taking into account the 
targets set by the federal government for growth, inflation and 
revenue generation.
    
The SBP Governor has been authorised to take measures in emergency 
situations but would have to report to the Central Board for 
approval. The Governor would now have powers to determine the limit 
of credit for the federal government, provincial governments and 
other official agencies.
    
A significant feature is the submission of a quarterly report by 
the State Bank Governor to the parliament on the affairs of 
national economy with particular reference to economic growth, 
money supply, credit, balance of payments and prices.
    
Another amendment made in the State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956 bars 
any governmental or quasi governmental institution to issue any 
directive to any banking company which is inconsistent with the 
policies, regulation and directives of the Central Bank.
    
Bankers consider this amendment to effectively check the pressures 
brought about by the government in previous years on nationalised 
commercial banks to finance yellow cabs, yellow houses, green 
tractors, forestation and beautification of cities programmes.
    
Under the amendment made in the Banks Nationalisation Act 1974, the 
Pakistan Banking Council also stands dissolved after functioning 
for over 12 years during which it carried out coordination between 
the banks and the government, monitor the banks and reported to 
government periodically on the performance of government controlled 
banks and financial institutions.
	
 "State Bank is simply taking over assets of about Rs 600 million 
from the PBC without any liability," a senior officer of the 
Council informed Dawn on telephone. He said that PBC has set up a 
National Institute of Banking and Finance (NIBAF) in Islamabad to 
carry out advance courses in banking. The real estate worth of 
NIBAF is said to be about Rs 350 to Rs 400 million. The Council has 
also invested more than Rs 200 million in various tax free 
investment schemes now being taken over by the State Bank.
    
PBC has at present 150 staff drawn from three NCBs. It has an 
annual budget of about Rs 450 million which was contributed in 
equal shares by the three NCBs.
    
Under the ordinance, all staff will go to parent bank. However fate 
of Mr Azizullah Memon who is the senior most banker in M1 grade and 
is past president of United Bank is still to be decided.
    
The ordinance also provides a fix tenure of three years for the 
presidents of the NCBs to be appointed by the federal government in 
consultation with the State Bank.
    
Henceforth chairmen of the board of directors will be appointed to 
frame policies for the banks. These ordinance will require 
ratification of the National Assembly to be elected on February 3. 
On expiry of the maturity period these ordinances will cease to be 
law unless adopted by the National Assembly.

<a name="niti">NIT-ICP merger strongly supported</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Jan 16: The idea of merging the National Investment 
Trust and Investment Corporation of Pakistan prior to privatisation 
has received strong support from the relevant Task Force during its 
four-day deliberations, according to an informed source.
    
It was the majority view among members of the Task Force that these 
separate organisations cannot withstand any competition from the 
much bigger players from foreign markets. The argument in favour of 
their merger is reinforced by the fact that the two organisations, 
acting separately, have failed to reverse the bearish trend 
persisting in the stock market for more than three years. In that 
process, tens of billions of rupees of the investors have remained 
locked up, without their being able to do anything about it, the 
source remarked.
    
He acknowledged that the ICP and NIT had played a yeoman's role in 
the development of the stock market in Pakistan over a quarter 
century. However, ever since the on-set of liberalisation and de-
regulation, they have been unable on account of lack of requisite 
skills and resources to hold their own against the international 
fund managers.
    
ICP and NIT have failed to keep pace with the times because, 
answerable only to the Ministry of Finance, they are basically 
bureaucratic set-ups without the kind of professionalism and 
reflexes necessary for operating efficiently and profitably in a 
free market. Thus ICP made profits only when it floated small funds 
amounting to, say, Rs 5 million. The source cited the unfortunate 
experience of its fund called "Prism". When its subscribers 
clamoured for dividend, it was contended by ICP that this was the 
first mutual fund which guaranteed the return of the capital and 
that this capital was blocked up in the stock market owing to the 
prolonged slump.
    
In this regard, an efficient private sector organisation would have 
divided it between fixed securities and the stock market so that 
the entire capital was not stuck up  a situation now prevailing to 
the detriment of the hapless investors.
    
The merged NIT-ICP would be rendered more attractive for a buyer 
company because it would thereby become a member of boards of 
directors of over 200 companies and thus be in a position to 
influence their decision-making, a privilege foregone by the NIT 
for the reasons that were obviously far from altruistic.

<a name="bank">Banks not encashing NIT units</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

LAHORE, Jan 19: President, Lahore Stock Exchange, Khwaja Hamid 
Saeed, expressed his grave concern over the refusal of banks to 
encash the National Investment Trust units.
    
In a statement, he said, banks are not encashing the NIT units for 
five, ten, fifty and hundred which, he feared, shows that banks 
have not enough money in this regard.
    
He said people have invested billions of rupees in NIT units and 
the prevailing situation is very grim.
    
He said if the people lost their investment in NIT, it will breach 
the trust of the people and would be a bad omen for the general 
investment culture of the country as the people are subjected to 
different scams one after the other.

<a name="stoc">Stocks pass through dull session</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Jan 21: Stocks passed through a dull session as attendance 
in the rings was thin owing to strike called by a religious group 
to mourn the death of Lahore bomb blast victims.
    
Although the trading hall remained opened there were not many 
buying and selling offers. An idea of sluggishness and investor 
disinterestedness may well be had from the fact that only 11 shares 
came in for trading, out of the 783, with nine finishing lower and 
only one gaining only five paisa. One remained static.
    
Volume hit the below one million share mark, reflecting the 
investors reluctance to indulged in trading. The KSE 100-share 
index fell 2.94 points at 1,429.63 as compared to 1,432.57 a day 
earlier as base shares fell further. The KSE all share index also 
showed a modest decline of 1.44 points at 904.99 as compared to 
906.43 a day earlier.
    
Owing to fresh pruning in the pivotals, the market capitalisation 
also suffered a fall of Rs 703.136m at Rs 444.339 bn as compared to 
445.042 bn a day earlier.
    
Price movements were highly fractional and reflected that buyers 
and sellers were just filling in the gaps but there was no genuine 
effort to pick up stocks of choice at the falling prices. That was 
perhaps why the highest gain was of five paisa only and loss one 
rupee, telling that there was no genuine activity.
    
The gain was noted in Dhan Fibre, which was traded higher by five 
paisa at Rs 5.15 on a business of 36,000 shares.
    
Among the losers, BRR Modaraba 1 and 11 were leading, which fell by 
one rupee each followed by PTC vouchers, Hub-Power, Bank of Punjab 
and FFC-Jordan Fertiliser, falling by 20 to 30 paisa each. Dewan 
Salman and ICI Pakistan also suffered fall of 15 paisa each on 
renewed selling.
    
Trading volume fell to 0.706m shares, bulk of which went to the 
credit of PTC vouchers, off 30 paisa on 0.250m shares followed by 
Hub-Power, easy 25 paisa on 0.225m shares. Other actively traded 
shares were led by Dewan Salman, lower 15 paisa on 90,000 shares 
followed by ICI Pakistan, easy 15 paisa on 65,000 shares, FFC-
Jordan, lower 20 paisa on 35,000 shares, and Bank of Punjab down 20 
paisa on 5,000 shares.
    
There was no physical business in Al-Meezan Mutual Fund, BRR 
Modaraba 1 and 11 and Ibrahim Modaraba, which were traded lower by 
five paisa to one rupee, with Ibrahim Modaraba remaining pegged at 
the last close of Rs 3.50.

<a name="ehte">Ehtesab or Intekhab ?  6</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

THE '1995-96 Survey' of the International Institute of Strategic 
Studies comments on Benazir's second government and on the role of 
the Pakistan Army:
    
"In Pakistan, the army has the final say in the power troika of the 
army chief, the president and the prime minister. Analysts there 
generally believe that the army allowed Bhutto to return to power 
because it desperately needed new arms supplies from the US and 
believed that only Bhutto could break the ice with Washington....
    
"Given the crucial role of the army in Pakistan's power structure, 
the retirement of an army chief and the selection of his 
replacement is always of great interest and frequently a matter of 
fierce in-fighting. Traditionally, chiefs have been reluctant to 
quit. But not only did General Abdul Waheed Kakar retire gracefully 
in December 1995, he has thus far stayed out of politics. His 
successor, General Jehangir Karamat, has evoked no controversy and 
he too has a reputation for being a tough, no- nonsense 
professional with no interest in domestic politics. The importance 
of this for a civilian prime minister cannot be over- estimated."
    
In this country, there is no such thing as 'free and fair' 
elections. Democracy is an elusive myth. Much wrong, and no right, 
is done to the people, in the name of the people. Elected 
representatives are expected to legislate; here they do not. During 
Benazir's second round of three years, only one significant act was 
enacted. The Abolition of Whipping Act. The 43 other acts passed 
related to amendments of existing legislation, many of which 
concerned the augmentation of the perks and privileges accorded to 
our parliamentarians which, needless to say, were all unanimously 
approved. Rather than legislate, Benazir preferred to govern by 
'advising' President Leghari to promulgate ordinances, which he 
did, obliging her 335 times.
    
The President dissolved the assembly on November 5, and the people 
were with him. To them, he was the lesser evil of the trio  
Benazir and Nawaz being the other two. The people's acceptance 
seems to have prompted him to project himself as the cleanest of 
the clean. The Mehran Bank affair, the Balochistan land affair, his 
grand lifestyle etc, etc have raised doubts in many minds. One 
large doubt: had he not been president, would he have managed to 
repossess the 29,000 acres taken over by the government in the 1972 
land reforms?
    
Right now there is an on-going argument about who exactly decided 
to form the Council for Defence and National Security. All 
concerned deny that they were the prime movers. The fact remains 
that it now exists, and is firmly hitched to the cabinet. However, 
General Jehangir Karamat has reportedly stated that if a newly 
voted-in government wishes to disband the Council, he and his army 
will have no objections. It is difficult to imagine that this can 
actually happen, circumstances being what they are and what they 
are likely to be.
    
Some have held that there was no necessity for this CDNS as there 
already exists a Defence Committee of the Cabinet which can well 
take care of the defence and security needs, although it has so far 
not been taken seriously. For instance, in 1984 the DCC imposed a 
ban on the construction of any additional tanks for oil and liquid 
storage in the oil tank farm area of the Karachi harbour, near the 
entrance to the Keamari wharves. This was done for the safety and 
security of the strategically vital port and harbour.
    
In 1995, Naval headquarters in Islamabad, with the concurrence of 
the then Chairman of the Karachi Port Trust, permitted two 
political nominee companies, (Al-Rahim Trading and ZY) to construct 
liquid storage tanks in the prohibited area. Despite the DCC ban, 
not one naval man, not one KPT man raised an objection. Why?
    
Such an action does not enhance the professionalism or image of the 
Pakistan Navy. Neither does the laying of a polo field at naval 
base PNS Karsaz, merely to please Asif, at the cost of crores of 
rupees of Naval funds. Neither does the selling of 100 acres (some 
500,000 sq. yds) of prime land of the naval base PNS Nathiagali, 
covering the entire strategic sea front near Cape Monze, to Asif-
crony Tufail Shaikh at Rs 6 per sq. yd (can one buy a yard of 
cotton cloth for this price?).
    
Last month, Vice-Admiral Tauquir Naqvi felt compelled to resign. He 
wrote:
    
".... I have come to the sad conclusion that even though I have 
three years to go before super-annuation I no longer find it an 
honourable course to serve under the present chief of the naval 
staff... I find that his manipulative style of leadership is not in 
consonance with the highest tradition of military leadership..."
    
Now to the subject at hand. As the days pass, none, other than 
Nawaz and those who hope to benefit, want elections before the 
accountability process is completed. The majority want neither 
Nawaz nor Benazir. They do not wish to go through yet another 
election, rigged this time in Nawaz's favour, which will burden 
them yet again with the same corrupt men sitting in their 
assemblies. They do not look forward to another dissolution in six 
months time. They fear that elections before their time may lead to 
the ultimate imposition of martial law.
    
This feeling is not indigenous. The Times, the mouthpiece of the 
Mother of Parliaments in London, on January 8 editorialised under 
the heading, "Time for Pakistan  Delaying elections may be better 
than it appears":
    
".... When he dismissed Benazir Bhutto and her Government last 
November, President Leghari was acting well within his 
constitutional rights. He could also claim to be acting in the 
country's best interests; the nation's finances were in a terrible 
state and Ms Bhutto was ever resistant to his demands for a 
crackdown on the rampant political corruption to which the 
financial crisis is linked....
    
"....A time-limited delay of the February elections would not 
necessarily be as damaging to Pakistani democracy as it seems. The 
two leading contenders have both been dismissed from office on 
corruption charges; three months was always too short a time for 
credible choices to emerge from such polluted political machinery.
    
"Time would also allow the interim Government to toughen up its 
accountability law, intended to disqualify politicians guilty of 
corruption. It was hastily drafted and has allowed too many big 
fish to slip through its meshes. In particular, there is need to 
tighten the new rules designed to bar politicians who have damaged 
the country's banking system by declining to repay massive personal 
loans to which nothing but their political influence entitled 
them."
    
The people say, let there be a time-limited delay in the holding of 
elections. Article 58(2)(b) provides for an appeal to the 
electorate. Article 48(6) permits the President "in his discretion 
or on the advice of the Prime Minister" (the advice being binding) 
to hold a referendum. Can the President not ask the people if they 
wish for a time-limited delay in the holding of elections (say, a 
period of 15 months) which would give him and his team (a changed 
team, he should get rid of the known rotters) time to strengthen 
the accountability laws and complete the process? From the highest 
to the lowest in the land, the feeling is that these elections are 
being held far too soon. The Chief Justice of Pakistan is all for 
accountability and has stated that the 90 days period is "too 
inadequate for completing the accountability process" (Dawn Jan 
13).
    
If, as it seems clear they will, the people vote for a time-limited 
delay, the Nawazians, the anxious hopeful beneficiaries, may go to 
court in protest. Let the CJ and his brethren then give their 
verdict.
    
Why is the President so keen on no accountability, why is he 
letting the political and bureaucratic looters and robbers escape 
scot free? If he wishes to absolve the criminals, let him be even-
handed. Let him calculate the total amount of money robbed, perhaps 
by some out of need, by those ordinary citizens who have been 
convicted and are in our jails for their crimes, and the total 
amount robbed by the elected representatives and their bureaucratic 
aiders and abetters. The former amount will be laughable, 
negligible, in comparison with the latter. 
    
If the grand larcenists are not to be touched, if they are to 
remain free, by all that is fair and right the petty larcenists in 
our jails must also be set free. There is only one law, and it 
covers the mighty and the lowly alike.

<a name="prom">Promises aplenty, with issues missing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

THE economic crisis the country faces is severe. Yet the main 
political parties which are seeking a mandate to govern for the 
next five years have a very casual and routine approach to the 
problems faced by the national economy. The PPP and PML(N) have 
each ruled the country for three years and two-and-a-half years 
respectively since 1990 and both have failed to resolve the crisis. 
They were dismissed more or less on similar charges. In view of 
this experience, they were expected to educate the people about the 
true nature of the economic malaise and suggest tangible solutions. 
Instead they have presented the voters with a catalogue of wishes 
and illusions. They have promised to do what they did not do in the 
past. If some of the promised measures were adopted, they failed to 
realise the promised goals. Surprisingly, the two parties have not 
even tried to explain their failures.

Notwithstanding the present crisis, Pakistan's economy is basically 
sound and resilient. For this it has to thank its solid 
agricultural base and manpower infrastructure. The root cause of 
all the economic ills is the budget deficit and the adverse balance 
of payments. In other words, it is our national habit of over 
consumption that has devastated us. The bulk of the federal 
government's revenues (about 85 percent) is consumed by two items  
debt-servicing and defence. The problem of the balance of payments 
too is aggravated by the debt-servicing. Only 15 percent of the 
state's revenues are left to run the entire civil administration 
and undertake essential development work.

Evidently these resources are not sufficient and only drastic cuts 
in expenditure or increase in revenues are the two available 
alternatives to balance the budget. The first one cannot even be 
attempted as defence and debt-servicing are considered unavoidable 
expenses which are not open to public scrutiny. Reduction in public 
expenditure on other items can at best be marginal and would not 
make any substantial impact on overall revenue spending. But at the 
same time these cuts would add considerably to the distress of the 
people through loss of jobs, reduction in already meagre social 
services and abolition of subsidies on essential items.

The other alternative  that of raising revenues through additional 
taxes  is being attempted for several years without any success. 
The reason is that the economic groups who have fabulous incomes 
and wealth have no desire to pay taxes and the political parties do 
not have the will to take them on. The feudal classes, businessmen, 
professionals and underground business tycoons defy the state with 
total impunity. The additional taxes imposed in the current year 
will amount to Rs 60 billion, inclusive of utility charges. But 
they will not make any change in the tax-GDP ratio which remains 
the same as it was a decade ago.

It is because of the fact these additional levies operate under the 
law of diminishing returns. New taxes raise the burden of those who 
are already paying them and new tax payers are not roped in. 
Similarly bank loan defaulters have defied all attempt at 
repayment. The political governments as well as the all-powerful 
caretakers have totally failed on both counts. The party platforms 
are ominously silent on how they intend to deal with these twin 
problems.

The PPP has hinted at a third alternative which has so far remained 
a forbidden subject because the international lenders do not want 
even a mention of it. It is the rescheduling of foreign debts. 
Pakistan's economy, by all accounts, is basically sound. Its 
difficulties are temporary for which the international lending 
agencies are also partly responsible. They overlooked, rather 
encouraged, mismanagement so long as the then governments served 
their interests in the cold war years. These accumulated loans and 
continued expanded overspending are the legacies of that period. 
With the neglect of the existing assets and the failure to create 
new assets, the country could not enhance its repayment capacity. 
Now a period of respite is needed.

Under these circumstances all promises of raising education and 
health budgets, to eradicate poverty, eliminate illiteracy and 
disease are meaningless. Similarly the assurances of making 
provision of cheap credit for industry or arranging special relief 
packages for special economic groups lack credibility. Such 
gimmicks are immediately neutralised, even if attempted, as in the 
case of the caretakers, by increases in utility charges and cost of 
social services and the trimming of essential development projects. 

The platforms of the parties, especially the major ones, would have 
carried weight if they had devoted space to measures to gear up 
national efforts to mobilise more resources and to soften up 
resistance of the powerful vested interests against tax payment, 
the documentation of the economy and loan repayment. Instead the 
emphasis of the major parties is on more liberalisation and 
deregulation of the economy and privatisation of the large 
enterprises. The objectives of these broad policy measures are not 
so much to benefit the economy as to clear the way for more loans 
in the immediate future.

One is disappointed with the poverty of new ideas in the programmes 
of the political parties. The PML(N) plans to bring the prices of 
agricultural produce gradually in line with international prices on 
the basis of export prices. No similar assurance is given in 
respect of the price of labour, the most important element in 
agriculture. Unless all factors are remunerated at that level, and 
that is possible only with the enhancement of productivity, it will 
bring disaster. The PPP promises to discontinue all perks of civil 
servants and fix only cash emoluments. It is a very sound principle 
in a democratic set-up but the question arises why this was not 
attempted when it was in office. Similar questions may be asked 
about the promise to abolish the contract labour system.

What is heartening is the fact that both PML(N) and PPP have 
promised to adopt Orangi Pilot Project as a model for neighbourhood 
management and the mobilisation of grassroots development 
endeavours. For country-wide efforts, democratically elected local 
self government institutions, with constitutional guarantees of 
continuity and fiscal powers, are a requisite for the success of 
such projects. But local bodies do not figure as an important 
component in either of the major parties' manifestos. Only MQM, for 
the reason of its being solely urban based, gives enough importance 
to these institutions. In the 1993 election manifesto the PPP had 
devoted much space to the devolution of powers to the lowest level 
but this time the subject has been downgraded to insignificance.

None of the parties speaks of the fundamental cause of corruption 
in the revived parliamentary system of governance in the country. 
It is the fractionalisation of the development programme, put under 
the charge of MNAs and MPAs that has opened floodgates of 
corruption. It acts against a strategy of coordination and 
prioritisation on the basis of the economy's needs. This malady is 
the continuing consequence of the 1985 non-party elections when 
members were, by necessity, disciplined by offering them 
inducements such as allocation of development funds. Now these 
funds have become, by tradition, part of the rights and privileges 
of the members. As members' projects escape proper technical 
scrutiny and economic return criteria they adversely affect the 
overall development programme and also give rise to corrupt 
practices. It was time that the parties should have voluntarily 
offered to abandonment of this practice in their programmes.

<a name="reve">Reversing decline of governance</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr Maqbool Ahmad Bhatty

A GREAT deal has been written about accountability over the past 
couple of months, and a significant proportion of the thinking 
public appears to favour the weeding out of those politicians and 
civil servants whose record does not stand up to minimum standards 
of integrity.
    
Accountability, of course, pertains to past acts, among which abuse 
of authority, and misuse of government funds are the main 
considerations for punitive action, which is designed as much as 
retribution as deterrence for the future. However, a critical 
appraisal of the standards of governance, and of the accelerating 
pace of deterioration in those standards is even more essential, 
since a great deal of what is wrong with our system can be traced 
to a precipitous decline in the quality of governance in Pakistan 
since our independence.
    
Over the past fifty years, the assumption of authority by our own 
people has not produced any real improvement in attitudes towards 
the common man, who has come to dread any contact with state 
institutions, that have proliferated, but have also progressively 
deteriorated owing basically to the lack of any concept of 
officials being "public servants." The proliferation has been due 
to the assumption of many additional functions by the state, 
ostensibly to improve the quality of life, but the persistence of 
bureaucratic attitudes, accompanied by lack of accountability, have 
led the man in the street to see government officials as petty 
tyrants, an image which government employees from Naib Qasids 
upwards appear to relish. Indeed, the aura of authority, and of 
power, remains the main attraction of government service, 
accompanied by the opportunities to amass wealth, through the 
misuse of the power and authority, wherever possible. In addition, 
having an official position is helpful for getting those routine 
things done which become a source of bother to the ordinary 
citizen.
    
As we open, hopefully, a new chapter of our national life, with 
increased emphasis on accountability, there is a concomitant task 
of improving the quality of governance in the country. The state 
apparatus has evolved over the ages and its three accepted 
components  the legislature, the executive and the judiciary  
provide a framework designed to make the life of the citizens safe, 
secure and as happy as possible. A concept has emerged over the 
centuries, of the state being responsible for the welfare of the 
citizens and for safeguarding their fundamental rights, to which 
Islam made a major contribution.
    
Corruption seems to have seeped into practically all walks of life 
in Pakistan, mainly because wealth has become the main criterion 
for distinction, rather than righteous living as expressed in the 
word "taqwa", which means shaping one's conduct on the fear of God. 
Indeed the "momin" is expected to be constantly aware of his 
mortality, after a short span on this earth, and to shape his 
conduct on the basis of accountability on the "Day of Judgment." At 
the same time, Islam recognises that human beings are prone to 
temptation, and the Islamic state is required to put in place a 
system of governance that punishes criminals and law-breakers who 
violate the rights and steal or exploit the possessions of others. 
If this ideology, to which most of us subscribe publicly, were 
taken seriously, we would not be bogged down the way we are in a 
society where the worst features inherited from the caste system of 
the sub-continent, and of a colonial past appear to prevail.
    
The institutional arrangements being put in place to enforce 
greater accountability are an imperative necessity, and would help 
prevent the worst excesses that have come to notice. However, the 
decline of standards of governance, and the pervasive culture of 
denying rights unless they can be secured through connections or 
corruption need to be tackled through a comprehensive set of 
measures. One measure that was taken some fifteen years ago was the 
establishment of the office of "Ombudsman" or "Wafaqi Muhtasib" at 
the Federal Capital. Though its jurisdiction was limited to the 
Federal Government institutions, it did provide a means of redress. 
It is a measure of the half-heartedness of our rulers that though 
the step was taken by General Zia-ul-Haq during the period he 
enjoyed absolute powers, the institution was not replicated in the 
provinces, until much later, and still does not exist in all of 
them.
    
Models of good governance abound, specially in the developed 
countries, such as Japan, the UK and the Scandinavian countries. 
Pakistanis who live in those countries, or visit them, point out 
the tension-free character of dealings with the government 
departments, in which courtesy and helpfulness are the order of the 
day. There is seldom any obstruction or delay, and whether it is 
some formality such as renewal of a passport or licence, or a more 
complex transaction involving property or taxes, there is very 
little hassle over an untraceable file, or an absent functionary. 
The basic approach is businesslike, and the officials concerned are 
not out to demonstrate their authority by insisting on some routine 
or formality, and there is consideration for the fact that citizens 
have rights, and that their time is valuable. Taxes are paid and 
received without too much fuss. The authorities dealing with law 
and order are also both approachable and helpful. So, with good 
governance, the citizens get their problems solved with the 
assistance of courteous and helpful officials. There is respect for 
the law, and its enforcers, and an environment of security and 
peace is achieved, with citizens paying their taxes for the 
services that are manifestly extended to them.
    
When we cast a look at the manner in which the government machinery 
functions in Pakistan, the picture is far from edifying. 
Inefficiency is the order of the day, since merit has become a 
secondary consideration owing to the prevalence of political 
patronage and corruption. If you owe your job to "sifarish", or a 
bribe, you have not been selected on the basis of your competence, 
and you are not expecting to be held accountable. Though no 
administrative set-up consists of star performers, there used to be 
a high proportion of competent performers in various departments in 
the early years of independence. The assumption of power by our own 
elite has been followed by a progressive deterioration of 
performance in most government offices. This is due to several 
reasons, including falling educational standards, and the rising 
pressure of work due to our exploding population. But the most 
important single reason has been the abandonment of merit, and the 
neglect of accountability.
    
As a result, the citizen who has to perforce deal with some 
government organisation or another for the conduct of his business 
or for access to social services that are in the control of the 
state, finds himself harassed, compelled to wait for the completion 
of incomprehensible formalities, owing either to red-tape or the 
absence of key officials who are on tour or on leave. He is 
extended very little courtesy, for he is dealing with the remnants 
of a colonial culture in which every official is a "sahib" who has 
power that is seemingly without any check on it. The citizen, who 
is both poor and illiterate, realises that not only has he no 
rights but that there is hardly any redress available for the 
wrongs he encounters.
    
The irony of this situation is that while it caters to the ego of 
the officials, who should be facing reprimands for inefficiency and 
discourteous behaviour, it is tailor made for corruption. You 
either find a patron in high places, or pay a bribe, and all the 
seemingly insuperable obstacles to your request or document 
disappear. We have seen a great display of ingenuity, as well as 
sheer gall in creating avenues for corruption. The principal ploys 
are as follows:
    
i) Inaccessibility: the sahib is in a "meeting" (which may be a tea 
session with a colleague), with his superior, or on tour. Even if 
he is present, the underling who has the file is sick, or out on an 
errand etc. Consequence? Come again tomorrow, or after Friday. The 
Naib Qasids of important functionaries bask in the light of their 
importance and often get a price for arranging access.
    
ii) Indifference: the sahib is very busy. Even if he receives you, 
he has this, that or the other task that will keep him preoccupied 
for the immediate future.
    
iii) The missing file: Your file is not traceable. If it is found, 
key papers are missing.
    
iv) Inadequate documentation: You bring an application, or set of 
documents for some purpose. Some fault can always be found with it. 
If you bring original documents, they may not be suitably worded, 
or their authenticity can be questioned. In case you bring copies, 
their authentication by the correct person may be demanded.
    
Where payment of bills is involved, specially for large amounts, or 
where tenders are involved for government purchases, the scope for 
commissions is being constantly enlarged. The costs may go up, or 
may be deliberately inflated, in order to increase the commissions. 
All in all, nearly every department evolves some way of generating 
income through obstruction or exercise of discretion, with 
officials of even such welfare oriented departments as education 
charging for admissions or pass marks. Many officials of 
departments dealing with law and order who are expected to 
apprehend such anti-social elements as burglars, murderers and drug 
pushers also tend to show more interest in enriching themselves 
than in serving the vague cause of public order.
    
The catalogue of types of poor governance, which have flourished 
largely under the political patronage of democratically elected 
representatives can be endless. Their patronage has reinforced 
objectionable attitudes, in which bureaucrats consider that their 
authority lies in saying "no", without realising that they are thus 
neglecting their main task of serving the people whose taxes pay 
their salaries.
    
A major task for the caretakers, in the few weeks left of their 
tenure, is to initiate steps specifically designed to improve the 
quality of governance, by compelling a change in attitudes, and 
ensuring closer supervision of officials, with a focus on their 
public dealings. Anti-corruption measures have traditionally added 
to the cost of corruption, rather than eliminated it. More frequent 
access by ministers and senior officials to the public, and 
enforcement of rigorous penalties against corrupt officials are the 
obvious remedies. Even more important would be a campaign in the 
electronic media, specially television, identifying the widespread 
instances of bad governance. In the long run, the selection of 
officials on merit, and strengthening of institutions of 
accountability, such as those of the Muhtasibs might be the answer.

<a name="wide">W.I. destroyed by pace & spin as Pakistan win 1st final</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SYDNEY, Jan 18: Pakistan had a comfortable four-wicket victory over 
West Indies in the first of the three finals at the Sydney Cricket 
Ground (SCG). Their authority was such that they reached the target 
with 11.4 overs to spare after West Indies were restricted to 179 
for 9.
    
Their first win in the World series final overs hot to spinners 
Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmed and Shahid Afridi who kept the 
pressure on once the opening stand of 99 was broken between Junior 
Murray and Sherwin Campbell. Waqar Younis, who had an expensive 
first spell in which he gave away 29 runs in four overs, when 
brought back was as much devastating as were the spinners.
    
Later Shahid Afridi, Ijaz Ahmed and Moin Khan dominated the 
proceedings as the West Indians struggled to check their victory 
march. Afridi made 53, Ijaz a gritty 60 adding 71 runs for the 
fifth wicket with Moin Khan to take Pakistan to within 10 runs of 
victory.
    
The impressive performances was lauded by none other than the Prime 
Minister of Australia, Mr John Howard, who visited the dressing 
room to congratulate the team. 
    
Pakistan chasing 180 for victory lost two wickets for 40 in the 
11th over after Inzamam-ul-Haq and Zahoor Elahi were out to poor 
shots but Shahid Afridi and Ijaz Ahmed batted sensibly and 
attractively to add 53 runs for the third wicket. Afridi reached to 
his third fifty in one-day games with 8 fours and in only 50 
deliveries before being caught at long off by Courtney Walsh off 
Ian Bishop for 53.
    
Mohammad Wasim was run out after a mix-up but Ijaz and Moin steered 
the innings without much fuss taking Pakistan near the target. 
Ijaz's 60 contained 3 fours in 71 balls. his dismissal by Walsh 
left Pakistan win only ten runs to win which was comfortably taken. 
Moin Khan hit a four and a six off successive balls from 
Chanderpaul to get past the required runs.
    
West Indies after being put in by Wasim Akram were given a solid 
start of 99 by Junior Murray and Sherwin Campbell who enjoyed their 
share of luck as well as the partnership flourished. Murray, when 
zero was missed off Waqar Younis in the slips - a difficult chance 
but catchable. Later he also survived a run out appeal when the 
television umpire decided in his favour.
    
Waqar bowling a wayward line was mauled for 28 runs in four overs 
and had to be taken off. Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmed and Shahid 
Afridi wee all introduced into the attack as Akram made quick 
changes to dislodge the pair. But it was Mushtaq who broke the 
stand when Murray hit low down to him when 48. In the next over 
Brian Lara mistimed a drive into the hands of Afridi, the bowler, 
who held onto a low catch. Lara had faced only two balls without 
scoring. Not much later Afridi with a faster one bowled Campbell 
minutes after he had reached his fifty in 87 balls, having hit five 
fours.
    
Waqar, brought back for his second spell in the 32nd over, 
devastated the middle order. He bowled Shivnarine Chanderpaul first 
ball of his second spell and had Phil Simmons leg before on the 
last delivery of the same over for 0. Robert Samuels was his third 
victim as he forced the batsman on the back foot. in nine balls he 
had taken three wickets.
    
Afridi, with a quicker delivery, then had Jimmy Adams leg before 
for 2 and suddenly West Indies had slumped to 7 for 123 from 0 for 
99. In his first four overs Waqar, who had conceded 29 runs, had 
given away only seven runs taking three wickets in his next four 
overs.
    
Roland Holder and Ian Bishop then put on 53 runs in 85 balls for a 
record eighth wicket stand against Pakistan to make the score look 
relatively respectable.
    
Jamshed Mujahid's direct throw from covers as Bishop attempted a 
run resulted in Holder's demise when 32. Curtly Ambrose, the ninth 
man out, was out next ball leg before to Waqar as Pakistan 
restricted West Indies to 179 for 9. Waqar with 4 for 43 and Afridi 
with 3 for 33 were the stars of the show.

<a name="paki">Pakistan rout W. I to take World Series crown</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

MELBOURNE, Jan 20: In a sensational and low-scoring match for a 
one-dayer Pakistan toppled the West Indies by 62 runs today to 
clinch the World Series, the trophy and the prize money of 100,000 
dollars set for the annual competition.
    
The Melbourne crowds could not believe their eyes that Pakistan 
collapsed for just 165, which appeared an easy target for the 
Caribbean but latterly the West Indies' batsmen made a procession 
to the pavilion in the face of hostile and venomous bowling of 
Wasim Akram, Shahid Nazir and Waqar Younis and the whole lineup 
succumbed to a paltry score of 103, thus achieving an unprecedented 
success on the Australian soil.
    
The Pakistani migrants were delighted and cheered with joy as Waqar 
uprooted the stump of Cameron Cuffy, the last man.
    
After being bowled out for a disappointing 165, Pakistan bounced 
back in the match with some superb bowling and fielding to strangle 
the West Indian batting and bowl them out for 103 in the 41st over.
 
As the powerhouse of the West Indian batting crumbled, the lights 
of the MCG also failed for about 20 minutes with West Indies 
struggling at 87 for 7. With the lights switched on once again, 
Pakistan also came alight, wrapping up the West Indian innings 
giving away only 16 more runs for the remaining three wickets.
    
The West Indian batting collapse was as sensational as was that of 
the Pakistanis earlier on. With only 2 runs scored West Indies had 
lost five wickets and at one stage it seemed they might not be able 
to pass even their lowest 87 made against Australia at the SCG four 
years ago. Wasim Akram had started the rout by forcing Sherwin 
Campbell onto his wicket. in the second over Junior Murray was out 
leg before to Waqar Younis and then Akram had Sivnarine Chanderpaul 
and Carl Hooper on the second and fourth ball of his sixth over. 
Their dismissal was followed by that of Jimmy Adams, Phil Simmons 
and Brian Lara by Shahid Nazir who had replaced Waqar. In six overs 
he had taken 3 wickets for 8 runs and West Indies were down to 7 
for 42.
    
If not for the 47 run eighth wicket stand between Ambrose and 
Roland Holder, they may have perished within 100 runs. Ambrose with 
an unbeaten 31 was their highest scorer. Chanderpaul and Lara were 
dismissed off spectacular catches by Moin Khan who was at his best 
to say the least. Once the eighth wicket stand was broken by Shahid 
Afridi as he bowled Holder for 20, Pakistan amidst jubilation of 
its supporters got rid of Walsh and Cuffy by Saqlain and Waqar.
    
Afridi was the Man of the finals and Lara Man of the Series.
    
It is a great moment for a young team that we had. They had firm 
belief in themselves and it was the key to our success," said a 
delighted Wasim Akram.
    
He paid rich tributes to his team and praised the West Indies for 
the exciting final.
    
Pakistan batted ineptly after winning the toss. In their 165 all 
out in the 49th over, there were two mindless run-outs of Inzamam-
ul-Haq and Wasim Akram. Luckily for them Ijaz Ahmed once again rose 
to occasion with a gritty 45 and Mohammad Wasim having come at the 
fall of the fourth wicket at 53 was the last man out having scored 
41 in nearly two hours batting and later Moin Khan's whirlwind 26 
in 29 balls made things look relatively respectable.
    
Pakistan made two changes, bringing in Aamir Sohail and Shahid 
Nazir for Mujahid Jamshed and Mushtaq Ahmed. on a bouncy wicket 
Afridi should not have opened, the skill was not there when he 
could not get away from a Courtney Walsh delivery. Zahoor Elahi, as 
in other ties on Australia, chased an outswinger in the hands of 
Brian Lara at first slip off the same bowler.
    
Aamir Sohail's stay for nearly an hour produced 32 runs with Ijaz 
Ahmed as the two tried to salvage the situation. Aamir Sohail then 
played a loose drive to Lara in the covers off Cameron Cuff and 
departed. Inzamam-ul-Haq made a suicidal call for run and paid the 
price as both he and Ijaz ended at the same end and Carl Hooper's 
throw did the rest. Third umpire adjudged Inzamam out as he had 
left his crease. Ijaz, who had reached the landmark of 4,000 runs 
in one-day games, occupied the crease for 112 minutes before edging 
Phil Simmons to Murray when 45.
    
With Mohammad Wasim he had put on 43 runs for the fifth wicket. For 
Wasim Akram the second run was not there as he glanced to leg and 
Jimmy Adams in a flash threw the ball to the keeper with Wasim 
struggling to get to safety. Wickets kept tumbling as young 
Mohammad Wasim held on to his end stubbornly. He could not take 
risk but Moin Khan did and swung his bat with purpose to add 36 for 
the seventh wicket. His dismissal by Adams at 137 left Wasim there 
to play out the overs. it did not take long for Cuffy and Ambrose 
to polish off the tail.
    
Saqlain was caught at the wicket off Cuffy and Ambrose had Waqar 
Younis yorked with a slower ball and when a desperate Wasim tried 
to hit out he was taken at point by Adams.
    
Pakistan had fallen least knowing that perhaps West Indies could be 
as fragile.

<a name="melb">Melbourne win, a milestone in post-Imran era</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Jan 20 (APP) : Pakistan's victory over West Indies in 
Melbourne was hailed as a milestone in post- Imran Khan Cricket era 
of the country.
    
Cricket commentators described Pakistan's first-ever triumph in 
World Series Cricket, a regular annual feature of Australian 
domestic season, as a catalyst to the country's newly-found world-
beating prowess.
    
The glorious victory assumed a further coating of lustre with the 
news that Pakistan had claimed top position in ratings of cricket 
playing countries with six Pakistanis also listed among the top 10 
Cricketers around the globe.
    
Not since lifting of the World Cup by Imran Khan on March 25, 1992, 
Pakistan had posted such an impressive win in a One-Day Tournament, 
the Cricket observers said.
    
The Melbourne victory was flaunted in cricket circles as the most 
dazzling of last five years along with Test Series win in England 
in 1992 and 1996.
    
Member Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Council, Ashraf Qureshi, 
eulogised Pakistan's victory as all the more laudable since it was 
achieved in the absence of two leading batsmen Saeed Anwar and 
Salim Malik.

MELBOURNE (Australia), Jan 20: Pakistan sensationally took the 
World Series one-day crown at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after 
bowling out the West Indies in just over 40 overs to wrap up the 
best-of-three series 2-0.
    
Intense pressure from Pakistan's world-class pace duo, Wasim Akram 
and Waqar Younis, with fine support from Shahid Nazir, forced a 
dramatic Windies mid-order collapse. Then, as Curtly Ambrose and 
Roland Holder began to stage a recovery a power cut plunged the 
ground into darkness.
    
The lights were out for 24 minutes and the Windies were out soon 
after.
    
Pakistan's first win in six World Series attempts was seemingly 
against the odds after their batsmen withered before an Ambrose and 
Courtney Walsh attack to be all out for 165 in 48.3 overs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

KARACHI, Jan 21: Wicketkeeper Moin Khan, third in cricket ratings, 
is the quickest Pakistan player with the gloves to complete 100 
victims behind the wickets.
    
Moin touched the 100-mark in his 71st match against the West Indies 
during the first match of the best-of-three finals at Sydney on 
Saturday. He added three more scalps on Monday to finish the tour 
with 103 victims that include 76 catches and 27 stumpings.
    
Moin eclipsed the record of Rashid Latif, his main rival for the 
lone place in the team who is presently out of selectors favours. 
Rashid had reached the magical three figures from 81 matches. 
Rashid has so far accounted for 103 batsmen behind the wickets in 
83 matches.
    
Rashid had overhauled the record of Salim Yousuf who had reached 
100 victims in 83 matches. The `Tiger', who later managed the 
Pakistan team with Intikhab Alam, ended his career with 102 victims 
(80 catches and 22 stumpings) in 86 matches.
    
Interestingly, none of the Pakistan wicket-keepers have so far 
completed a double in one-day internationals. Moin Khan is closed 
to that landmark with 854 runs at 20.11. Rashid Latif scored 633 
runs at 15.43 with one 50 while Salim Yousuf scored 768 runs at 
17.86 with four half centuries.

<a name="paku">Pak U-19 SA tour Hasan Raza hammers 2nd successive ton</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

WILLONMORE PARK, BEMONI (South Africa) Jan 21: A flawless century 
by Hasan Raza, his second successive ton on the tour, coupled with 
a fine knock of 70 by left-hander Shahdab Kabir, enabled the 
Pakistan under-19 XI reach 276 for the loss of six wickets at draw 
of stumps on the first day in their two-day fixture against 
Easterns Under-19.
    
Winning the toss and electing to bat, the Pakistani youngsters got 
off to a fine start when Shadab Kabir and Farhan Adil put on 32 
runs for the first wicket before the latter parted company after 
scoring 14 runs.
    
M. Salim joining Shahdab, left with the score at 74, after 
contributing 17 runs to his team's total, but the fireworks really 
began when next batsman Hasan Raza joined Shadab and the two were 
associated in a fine partnership of 75 runs.
    
Shahdab, after batting facing 163 deliveries in his 220 minutes at 
the crease finally fell, caught by skipper Meyer bowled by Botha 
for a well played knock of 70 runs, studded with six boundaries.
    
Another fine partnership ensued between Ahmer Saeed and Hasan, who 
in the meantime completed his half century, facing 116 balls in 128 
minutes at the wicket, with four boundaries being his principal 
strokes.
    
After adding 52 runs for the fourth wicket, Ahmer was dismissed for 
21 runs. Bazid Khan, the new batsman then added 56 runs for the 
fifth wicket with Hasan Raza, before he was dismissed for 16 runs.
    
In the meantime Hasan Raza continuing to plunder the bowling from 
the short pitched deliveries went on to complete his well deserved 
century which contained seven boundaries, after facing 212 
deliveries in 257 minutes, but after scoring a splendid knock of 
121 runs was stumped by keeper Barnard, trying to lift Repsold out 
of the ground in the last ball of the day.
    
M. Shakil was still at the wicket with four runs as the Pakistan 
under 19 XI raced to 276 for 6.
    
Repsold, bowling a fine line and length picked up 2/58 and was well 
supported by Botha 2/32.
