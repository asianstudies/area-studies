<a name="oppo">Opposition takes oath under altered text</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Raja Asghar

ISLAMABAD, March 12: In an unprecedented protest, opposition
senators changed the text of the oath they took as members of the
newly-elected upper house at a stormy inaugural session of the
upper house, when they also boycotted the chairman's election.

While the protesting opposition stole the show in oath-taking,
which marked the full revival of the Constitution, its election
boycott over alleged government coercion against senators allowed
the ruling coalition to grab the offices of both the chairman and
deputy chairman of the house without a contest.

Former Sindh governor Mohammedmian Soomro was declared elected
chairman and Khalilur Rehman from the NWFP deputy chairman after
the opposition parties said they were not putting up their
candidates.

Later the Senate was adjourned for an indefinite period.

The inaugural session's presiding officer and former Senate
chairman Wasim Sajjad gave oath to members only after speaker after
speaker from opposition parties denounced the controversial Legal
Framework Order package of President Pervez Musharraf's decrees
amending the Constitution.

Opposition members said they were taking oath under the un-amended
constitution as it existed before Gen Musharraf seized power on Oct
12, 1999.

INSERTED OATH CHANGE: As they followed the presiding officer in
reading out, sentence by sentence, the text of the oath as written
in the Constitution, twice they qualified their pledges to perform
their functions "in accordance with the Constitution" and to
"defend the Constitution" with additional words... "as it was prior
to the 12th October, 1999".

However, the senators from the ruling PML-Q and its allies read out
the actual text of the oath which has not been altered by a total
of 29 amendments made by the LFO.

After a lot of shouting, Mr Sajjad agreed to allow one member each
from opposition parties to speak on the LFO.

Senator Raza Rabbani of the People's Party Parliamentarians (PPP)
gave a poetic start to the opposition assault when he began his
brief speech with a couplet by Habib Jalib: "Aisey dastoor ko, subh
benoor ko, main nahin maanta, main nahin jaanta (such a
constitution, a morning without light, I don't accept, I don't
know)".

Mr Rabbani said the combined opposition had decided to take the
oath "under the 1973 Constitution as it was before Oct 12, 1999".
But the presiding officer cut him short at this point, only to
invite more shouts from opposition members who ignored his calls
for "decorum".

The chair allowed Mr Rabbani after nine mainly opposition speeches
to have the last word, when he said the Supreme Court had no
jurisdiction to empower an individual to amend the Constitution,
which could be done only by a two-thirds majority of the two houses
of parliament.

As political entities and representatives of parties, "we refuse
that right to President Musharraf or anyone else," said Awami
National Party (ANP) Senator Asfandyar Wali Khan, who had resigned
from the party presidentship after the ANP's rout in the October
elections.

MMA's Prof Khurshid Ahmed, deputy chief of the Jamaat-i-Islami,
blamed Gen Musharraf for what he called the "murder" of the Senate
by dissolving it along with the National Assembly in 1999, called
his rule illegitimate and said the LFO had ceased to exist after
parliament came into being.

Babar Khan Ghauri of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement accused the
opposition of blocking a democratic process through anti-LFO
protests, which he said had deprived the National Assembly of an
opportunity to debate the important issue of the Iraqi crisis by
forcing the lower house's prorogation.

PML-N's former finance minister Ishaq Dar challenged the sincerity
of the ruling coalition's concern about Iraq and said if the
government regarded the issue so important, it would not have
prorogued the National Assembly on Monday and would not do the same
with Senate later on Wednesday.

PML-Q's veteran parliamentarian Anwar Bhinder, who lost to
Mohammedmian Soomro in his bid for party candidature for Senate
chairmanship, said there was no need for an opposition uproar on
oath-taking as the LFO had not amended the oath text.

While taking oath, opposition members raised their voices when
uttering the additional words "as it (Constitution) stood before
October 12, 1999".

Apparently to emphasize their point, Raza Rabbani, Safdar Abbasi
and some other PPP members took oath on an English text to repeat
their adherence to the non-LFO constitution.

The ruling coalition appeared to be playing it cool to ensure that
things did not go out of control, and kept some of its big guns in
the Senate such as veteran jurist S.M. Zafar and former information
minister Mushahid Hussain in reserve.

<a name="cons">Constitution revived after 41 months</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, March 12: The Constitution of the country fully revived
after exactly 41 months, when the members elected to the Senate
took oath. The emergency proclamation, issued on Oct 14, 1999, on
the basis of Gen Pervez Musharraf had held the Constitution in
abeyance and suspended Parliament, is not revoked yet.

Government's legal experts are not ready to comment whether
President Gen Pervez Musharraf still enjoys the powers under the
proclamation of emergency issued on Oct 14, 1999.

They, however, confirmed that the proclamation of emergency issued
on Oct 14, 1999 has not been revoked.

The controversy whether the original Constitution, which existed on
Oct 12, 1999 has been revived or it is the amended version, in
which the uniformed president enjoys complete domination, is still
raging.

The notification issued by the president on Nov 23, had stated,
"Article 59 to 63 (both inclusive) and Articles 232 to 239 (both
inclusive) on the day when the members elected to the Senate take
oath."

The Constitution, which under the Supreme Court judgment was to be
revived by Oct 12, 2002, exactly after three years, have been
revived five months after the deadline.

The Constitution is revived in two phases, in the first phase,
certain articles, mainly dealing with Senate, provincial
assemblies, anti-defection and amendment parliament to legislate
were not revived.

A government official said that the power of the parliament to
amend the Constitution is revived and those who were opposed to
LFO, are free to resort to Article 239.

When the issue of the LFO was raised before the Supreme Court, it
had also said that in the presence of Article 239, the court was
not required to pass any judgment.

In Pakistan two emergencies are still in effect, the first was
proclaimed by Mian Nawaz Sharif at the time of going nuclear in May
1998, and the other was issued on Oct 14, on the basis of which the
Constitution was held in abeyance.

The government has taken the position that the chief executive has
amended the Constitution under the legislative powers which were
granted to him by the Supreme Court and the LFO was now a part of
the Constitution and needed no validation from the parliament.

The legal experts who are not part of the government, however, have
different point of view.

Hamid Khan, president of Supreme Court Bar Association, however
said, no individual has the authority to amend the Constitution,
and not even if the Supreme Court said so. He said that the court
was not empowered to legislate itself and how could it vest such a
power to any individual, which was not available to itself.

The Constitution has been restored unamended as it stood on Oct 12,
1999 and for making the LFO as a part of the Constitution, resort
to Article 239 is must, he said. "At the most the LFO status is no
better than a proposal for amendment in the Constitution."

It is prerogative of the parliament to amend the Constitution under
the mechanism provided in articles 238 and 239.

About the proclamation of emergency issued on Oct 14, he said it
ceases to exist after the revival of the Constitution.

<a name="soom">Soomro elected Senate chairman</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD Mar 12: The combined opposition charged that the
government had used state machinery to gain support in elections to
the Senate. The opposition accusation came at a news conference
called before election of the chairman and deputy chairman of the
Senate.

Mohammedmian Soomro and Commander Khalilur Rahman of the Pakistan
Muslim League-Q were elected unopposed chairman and deputy
chairman, respectively, after the seven-parties combined opposition
pulled out of the process.

The opposition alleged that 54 senators were herded together at a
dinner by the country's premier intelligence to give them
instructions how and for whom to vote for chairman and deputy
chairman.

Makhdoom Amin Fahim, Qazi Hussain Ahmed and Javed Hashmi told
newsmen that the combined opposition had decided to requisition the
session of Senate after they had filed a requisition for the
National Assembly session in the day.

They justified taking of oath by their senators for, if they had
skipped it, it would have been presumed that they had accepted the
LFO as part of the Constitution.

After his election as chairman, Mohammedmian Soomro expressed the
hope that members of the Senate would concentrate on the issues of
their respective areas, particularly the problems of poverty,
backwardness.

Congratulating the new chairman and deputy chairman, Wasim Sajjad
assured them of full cooperation of the house in performance of
their duties.

Almost all the treasury members in the Senate criticized the
extremist attitude of the opposition and for keeping itself aloof
from the democratic process.

Veteran parliamentarian Anwar Bhinder said all amendments should be
brought to the house for assent.

S. M. Zafar, parliamentary leader of the PML-Q in the Senate, said
that the parliamentarians were duty bound to ensure the supremacy
of Parliament which was envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam and to which
Prime Minister Jamali was also committed. He said the opposition
should express itself instead of withdrawing from the proceedings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 13: Pakistan People's Party has expressed concern
over the use of military in Senate elections, and said President
Gen Pervez Musharraf wanted the upper house to be a subordinate
branch of the Pakistan military intelligence.

The PPP, in a statement issued, said that the party condemned the
unprecedented meddling of the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) in
the Senate elections.

"The PPP is concerned and condemns the over militarization of the
federation, the state and the society at a time of grave crisis for
the country and larger world community," the statement said, adding
that Pakistan was founded in the name of democracy by Quaid-i-Azam
Mohammed Ali Jinnah, but "today the founder's dream is being
shattered as democracy is systematically killed in the country".

It said that the sham democracy ushered in by the military regime
by rigging the elections, mutilating Constitution and back dated
and individual specific laws were robbing the people of their
political and economic rights.

As development and democracy go together, the absence of democracy
had stalled all development in the country, it said.

<a name="plan">Opposition plans to rotate top office</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, March 13: The opposition parties are considering a
proposal for a joint opposition leader in the National Assembly
with the condition that the office of the opposition leader will
rotate among the member parties, officials of the two opposition
parties confirmed.

Central Information Secretary of PML-N Siddiqul Farooq told Dawn
that a formula in this regard was under consideration which ensured
equal representation for all the opposition political parties in
the National Assembly.

Under this formula, the post of opposition leader will be held by
Maulana Fazlur Rehman of the MMA, Makhdoom Amin Fahim of the PPP,
and Makhdoom Javed Hashmi of the PML-N on rotation basis.

Senator Farhatullah Babar, PPP spokesman, told Dawn that opposition
parties were holding talks on the issue and it had been agreed that
effort should be made for a joint opposition leader.

With 18 MNAs, the PML-N holds the key to the election of opposition
leaders both in the National Assembly and Senate.

The PPP and the MMA have also laid claim to the slot of opposition
leader, who would also be a member of the National Security
Council.

Under the rules in case there are more than one candidate for the
slot of leader of the opposition, the speaker National Assembly has
to "nominate" a person who in his view commands support of maximum
number of members.

To bolster its claim for the slot, the PPP has reportedly announced
owning the splinter group, PPP Patriots, led by Rao Sikandar Iqbal.

The PPP (Patriots), however, has registered itself as a separate
entity with the Election Commission.

<a name="sena">Opposition senators not to take oath: LFO row runs deep</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Syed Irfan Raza

ISLAMABAD, March 10: Opposition leaders vowed that their senators-
elect would not take oath if it was administered under the
constitution as amended by the controversial Legal Framework Order.

Talking to reporters in the National Assembly building, Muttahida
Majlis-i-Amal leader Liaquat Baloch said opposition parties would
not participate in the election for the Senate chairman either.

However, he said, a joint line of action in the matter would be
taken by the opposition parties outside the house and added that
the decision would be honoured by the MMA.

He said the government had offered the opposition to settle the
issue outside the house.

He said leaders of the ruling coalition had announced during the NA
session that a debate on the LFO would be held in the house when it
would meet on Monday. "However, the government backed out and now
it wants to raise the Iraq issue instead of discussing the LFO."

On the occasion, PPP-Parliamentarians MNA Syed Khurshid Ahmed Shah
pointed out that the government had prepared a document which was
presented by the speaker to opposition leaders before the
announcement of prorogation of house.

According to the document, the government requires time to settle
the LFO issue outside parliament and therefore, the NA session has
been prorogued.

Khurshid Shah said opposition parties had decided that they would
not accept even a single clause of the LFO. "Government has to get
the entire LFO passed by a two-thirds majority in the National
Assembly, otherwise it will not be acceptable to the opposition."

A source in the National Assembly Secretariat told this reporter
that the government was ready to adopt a policy of "give and take"
and that some of the most controversial clauses in the LFO would be
abolished.

On the other hand, Prime Minister Zafarullah Khan Jamali said at a
press conference in the NA building that opposition parties should
accept the LFO as it had already been incorporated in the
constitution.

He, however, asked opposition parties to give some time to the
government to see how their grievances could be redressed and to
what extent the government could go to amend the LFO.

Talking to Dawn, the parliamentary leader of the Muttahida Qaumi
Movement, Kunwar Khalid Younas, said: "Not allowing the leader of
the house to speak during the session indicates that the opposition
is, in fact, disallowing the house proceedings to go on smoothly."

"What happened in the house was disgusting as it seems that the
opposition is not ready both in the house's business and the
foreign policy of the country," he said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

PESHAWAR, March 13: The Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) has said it
will expel its MPAs from the party if the charge of betrayal in
Senate elections is proved against them, says PML-N's provincial
vice-president Anwar Kamal Khan Marwat.

Talking to Dawn, Mr Marwat said a committee was trying to know why
two of its MPAs did not cast their votes in favour of party nominee
Sardar Mehtab Ahmed Khan. The committee comprised party leaders
Iqbal Zafar Jhagra, Malik Jehanzeb Khan and Abdul Subhan Khan.

According to Mr Marwat, who is also PML-N's parliamentary leader in
the NWFP assembly, Sardar Mehtab had polled two votes less than the
party's strength in the provincial assembly. However, there were
chances that two votes might have gone invalid.

"We will take action against defectors, once the probe is
completed. At this stage, we cannot take any action," said Mr
Marwat, adding that the committee would finalize its
recommendations within a week.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, March 9: The Awami National Party (ANP) has expelled
three of its MPAs for betraying the party in Senate elections on
Feb 24, and selling their votes to independent candidates.

Speaking at a news conference here at Peshawar press Club,
parliamentary leader in the house and NWFP ANP President Bashir
Ahmed Bilour said the party had terminated the basic membership of
Syed Kalb-i-Hasan of Kohat, Atiqur Rehman of Hangu and Sarfaraz
Khan of Gadoon-Swabi, and expelled them from the parliamentary
group as they had not voted for the ANP candidates running for
Senate seats.

ANP Information Secretary Haji Mohammad Adeel, Fareed Taufan and
Mian Iftikhan Hussain were also present on the occasion.

He said the ANP had always upheld its democratic credentials even
during the successive dictatorial regimes and discouraged the
political expediency in the party folds. "We are the followers of
Bacha Khan, who had launched a long struggle against the British
Raj in the sub-continent. We will not go against our tradition in
politics," he added.

Mr Bilour appealed also to other political parties to take action
against their renegades who had ditched their candidates on Feb 24.
"We hope the other betrayed political parties will follow us in the
struggle against lotacracy and take disciplinary action against
their defectors," he added.

He said that despite the betrayal of three MPAs, the ANP had won
two Senate seats with its seven votes in hand. Some other parties,
who had even 10 MPAs, could not bag two seats, he said.

The opposition parties had jointly put up Syed Kalb-i-Hasan for the
speaker's post on Nov 26, 2002, and he had bagged 39 votes against
incumbent speaker Bakht Jahan Khan.

Mr Bilour said that soon after the Senate elections, the party had
constituted an inquiry committee which found out three defectors in
the party.

The ANP, he said, would file a petition against them with the
Election Commission to have them disqualified from the assembly
seats.

Replying to a question, he said all the three accused MPAs could
file an appeal with the party working committee if they were
dissatisfied with the disciplinary action against them. The ANP had
taken a similar action in 1991, against its renegade MPAs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Correspondent

NOWSHERA, March 8: PPP leader Asif Ali Zardari said that
disciplinary action would be taken against those party MPAs in the
NWFP Assembly who voted against party's nominees in the Senate
elections.

Talking to newsmen after hearing in a corruption case at Attock
court, Mr Zardari said that the party MPAs were asked to vote for
Sardar Ali Khan and Farhatullah Babar. "Therefore, those who did
not vote for Sardar Ali have violated the party decision. These
people have betrayed the party. Party workers would hold them
accountable and the party too would take action against them," he
said.

The statement by Asif Zardari is the latest in the series by party
leaders and MPAs blaming each other for the party's poor
performance in the recently held Senate elections.

A party spokesman regretted a statement by former interior minister
Naseerullah Khan Babar who had given a clean chit to MPAs for their
vote in the Senate elections in which only one candidate managed to
get through while the other, Sardar Ali Khan, lost badly.

The loss prompted allegations of sell-out of votes by party MPAs,
who vehemently denied the charge, saying they had swapped votes in
accordance with the directives of the party chairperson Benazir
Bhutto.

The spokesman however, insisted that Ms Bhutto had nominated Sardar
Ali and Farhatullah Babar for the general and technocrat seats
respectively and had communicated the same to the PPP parliamentary
leader in the NWFP Assembly, Abdul Akbar Khan, over telephone in
the presence of Raza Rabbani, the party's secretary-general,
political secretary Naheed Khan, provincial president Khwaja
Mohammad Khan and other party MPAs.

The spokesman said that Mr Zardari had also conveyed the directives
to the MPAs through his emissary Dr Soomro.

<a name="read">Opposition ready for talks on LFO</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ahmed Hassan

ISLAMABAD, March 10: The combined opposition in the National
Assembly said it was ready for holding talks with the government on
LFO but at the same time made it clear that it will not give up
agitation on floor of the house till the objective was achieved.

Speaking at a joint news conference following the prorogation of
the house after opposition's created furore, the parliamentary
leaders of opposition parties said the government side had violated
an agreement reached in the parliamentary advisory committee and
instead of reading out the agreed statement speaker gave the floor
to the prime minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali.

The combined opposition parties held a meeting at the parliament
lobby and discussed various issues including the LFO and its
strategy in going into the Senate on Wednesday.

The opposition however appeared undecided on question whether the
senators belonging to it would take oath under LFO or not and the
decision was deferred for Tuesday.

The opposition also decided to requisition fresh session of the
National Assembly and got signatures of all the opposition MNAs
available in the house for submission to the speaker's secretariat
in next few days.

The opposition leadership denied the impression that the MNAs
belonging to MMA had not fully participated in Monday's agitation
at the time of prime minister's speech.

Qazi Hussain Ahmed said: We were given a good news that both sides
had agreed on certain points in the parliamentary advisory
committee that the house will be prorogued without any fuss but to
their dismay prime minister stepped in to speak.

Reacting to premier's statement on government's policy on UN
resolution he said the premier should have told us in clarity
whether Islamabad would vote in favour or against the resolution
seeking to attack Iraq instead of twisting the issue to make whole
thing ambiguous.

Makhdoom Amin Fahim said: "It appears the prime minister was
instructed from somewhere else that he has to deliver speech when
the opposition was in a mood to listen to him."

Staff Reporter

LAHORE, March 9: Punjab Chief Minister Pervaiz Elahi has urged the
opposition not to agitate the issue of the Legal Framework Order
and play its due role for the resolution of the people's problems.

Talking to MNAs and MPAs, he stressed the need for complete unity
between the government and the opposition for the sake of the
continuity of the democratic process in the country and in view of
the critical international situation.

The chief minister said all political parties had contested the
elections under the LFO. They had also signed their nomination
papers under the same order.

He said the women seats in the assemblies were increased and the
rights of minorities protected under the same LFO.

The chief minister said Gen Pervez Musharraf was the first army
ruler who conducted elections within the timeframe given for the
purpose and peacefully transferred power to the elected
representatives of people. He also saved the country from external
threats and restored the supremacy of parliament.

<a name="pppn">PPP never accepted LFO: Raza</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 9: The Pakistan People's Party has rejected the PML-
Q claim that the PPP, by participating in recent polls under the
Conduct of General Elections-2002, had accepted the controversial
Legal Framework Order (LFO).

In a statement issued, the PPP's acting secretary general, Mian
Raza Rabbani, claimed that the PML-Q contention was 'incorrect in
fact and laws'. He said: "PPP had rejected and continues to oppose
the LFO."

He said that the party was committed to the principle that
Constitution can only be amended through the procedure provided in
its Article 238 and 239 and not by an individual. Giving reasons
for opposing the LFO, he said that the Order sought to change the
basic structure of the Constitution and infringes on sovereignty of
parliament, and undermined its federal character. The LFO confers
discretionary powers on president without any check and balance.

Mr Rabbani maintained that Supreme Court could not vest powers with
an individual to amend the Constitution but even if the
government's argument was considered, the LFO transcended
limitations laid down by the Supreme Court in sub-paragraphs (i) to
(vii) of paragraph 6 of the Short Order dated May 12, 2000, he
said.

<a name="pppd">PPP describes Jamali's speech as disappointing</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 11: The Pakistan People's Party described Prime
Minister Zafarullah Jamali's address to the nation as
disappointing, saying it was nothing more than a "regurgitation of
pious hopes and vague promises".

A PPP spokesman said the speech was full of exhortations and
lamentations but lacking in policy decisions.

The speech was a wasted hour of national life, he alleged. "Mir
Zafarullah Jamali's assertion that parliament is sovereign and all
decisions will be taken by it is by far a cruelest joke," he said.

The Prime Minister claimed that his government would give provinces
their rights as guaranteed in the Constitution. How could the
government uphold those rights when, under the LFO, provinces did
not even have the freedom to make laws for local bodies without
approval of the president? he asked.

The PPP spokesman claimed that the Prime Minister sounded hollow
when he praised his "patron" General Musharraf and sermonized
opposition parties on the ethics of democratic and parliamentary
politics.

Like administrations condemned to work in the shadow of military
dictators, Mr Jamali could only speak of reforming the curricula
and stressed ideological orientation without addressing the basic
and fundamental issues of governance, he said.

The PPP spokesman said the Prime Minister promised that political
opposition would no longer be a basis for institution of cases
against opponents.

If he means what he says, the Prime Minister should first withdraw
politically motivated cases against all political leaders and then
make a promise about the future, he suggested.

<a name="pmre">PM reaffirms stand on Iraq: �Offers talks to India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 11: Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali
appealed to the United Nations that more time should be given to
peace so that the Iraqi crisis could be settled peacefully.

In his address to the nation on radio and TV, the prime minister
announced that it would be difficult for Pakistan to support attack
on Iraq. "We want betterment of the Iraqi people and our policy in
this regard is very clear," he said, adding that national interest
would be kept supreme in dealing with the issue.

Mr Jamali said he had already taken into confidence Pakistan's
friends in the Middle East during his visit to the region. "The
cabinet has taken a decision with consensus that we cannot support
war on Iraq".

The prime minister also invited India to hold dialogues with
Pakistan in order to sort out all unresolved issues peacefully
between the two countries.

He said he had earlier sent a message of goodwill to the Indian
leadership and, "today once again I repeat the same so that
complete peace could be restored for the progress and betterment of
the people of South Asia".

The prime minister said that Pakistan's foreign policy was based on
mutual understanding and international justice. "We want peace in
the world and this is also a message to the Indian leadership that
war phobia will not help resolve issues between our two nations."

Mr Jamali said that his government's policy was to hold talks with
India so that people of both the countries should not suffer any
more. "Let us talk and try to convince each other, otherwise we
know how to defend ourselves," the prime minister declared.

The country today, he said, was facing lawlessness and terrorism
where life and property of the common man was not safe. "But I
assure you that my government will remove this lawlessness,
terrorism and remove corruption from the society."

He said the government would take all decisions on merit and rapid
transfers of the government employees would be stopped.

The prime minister said people were facing numerous problems in
seeking justice from courts. "I would request the chief justice of
Supreme Court to expedite the cases which were being delayed for
years."

The prime minister said that a unified syllabus was being prepared
by his government so that every Pakistani could get education
without paying a lot of money.

He also said the government was trying to ensure availability of
quality medicines on reduced prices. He said a committee had been
set up to ensure availability of inexpensive drugs for people.

The prime minister said overseas Pakistanis also needed maximum
facilities especially when returning home. The prime minister ended
his speech by saying that his government would serve people without
any discrimination.

"Everyone will get justice and there will be no attack on places of
worship," he said, adding that his government would strive to
create an atmosphere where both men and women would have equal
opportunities.

LAHORE, March 10: ARD President Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan says the
office of president has been lying vacant since the 'retirement' of
Mr Rafiq Tarar on Dec 31 last year and parliament should give a
schedule for president's election immediately after the chairman
and deputy chairman of the Senate are chosen.

He said candidates for the top slot should qualify to become

Refusing to accept the result of last year's referendum, the ARD

the election of president.

The Nawabzada recalled that the Supreme Court had also held in a
judgment that a decision on the election of president through
referendum would be taken by the relevant forum at an appropriate
time.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 9: The Sindh chapter of Pakistan Muslim League
(Nawaz) is being re-organized to prepare itself for an active role,
according to Mamnoon Hussain, the party's Sindh chief and a former
governor.

Mr Hussain said that the party had failed to make its presence in
the electoral politics in the province because it was preoccupied
in sorting out party's affairs during the October elections.
Finally, he added, the party decided to overcome its weaknesses by
doing away with the tradition of imposing leadership from above. In
this regard, reorganization process has been started from the
grassroots level, he said.

Mr Hussain appeared quite hopeful about the return of the party's
top leadership from Saudi Arabia soon to play their vital role in
restoring the past glory and strength of the party.

Responding to questions, Mr Hussain said that the opposition
parties in the parliament had joined hands to safeguard the
parliamentary system as envisaged in the 1973 Constitution.

"The Legal Framework Order, without its validation by the
parliament cannot become part of the Constitution," he declared
adding that with the passage of time, PML stand that the army
dispensation could not deliver proved correct.

Mr Hussain suggested that the LFO be referred to the parliament for
validation and the portions approved by the House be made part of
the Constitution.

To a question, the PML-N leader said that the present dispensation
was being run by the people in uniform with Gen Musharraf holding
the dual post - Chief of the Army Staff and President.

Meanwhile, in a joint statement issued, Mamnoon Hussain, Salim Zia,
Syed Hafeezuddin, Mukhtar Kanhorvi, Nihal Hashmi, Khwaja Tariq
Nazeer and Nasiruddin Mehmood have protested against the arrest of
the party's parliamentary leader and deputy opposition leader in
Punjab Assembly, Rana Sanaullah Khan.

They said that the government did not tolerate opposition at any
level and wanted to suppress its struggle for the rights of the
oppressed people.

Demanding an immediate release of Mr Khan, they reiterated the
party's determination to continue the struggle for the restoration
of democracy and the Constitution, supremacy of parliament and
stability of the country.

FAISALABAD, March 11: The PML-N's Central Executive Committee will
decide future course of action about the Sanaullah incident,
party's chairman Raja Zafarul Haq said.

He was speaking at a news conference at the DHQ Hospital here after
visiting MPA Rana Sanaullah.

Raja Zafarul Haq regretted the statement of Prime Minister
Zafarullah Jamali that the kidnapping and torture of Sanaullah was
a provincial matter.

"I have dispatched a letter to the Prime Minister and the Punjab
chief minister for taking action against the personnel involved in
kidnapping and torture of Sanaullah."

He said that the incident would also be brought to the notice of
international human rights organizations and ambassadors of other
countries in Pakistan.

Mr Raja said that a committee comprising opposition leaders had
been set up to decide the mode of protest and future line of action
against the Legal Framework Order. The committee had also been
empowered to hold dialogue with the treasury benches.

He said the kidnapping and torture of Rana Sanaullah was a clear
signal to the elected representatives and general public that they
should not raise voice against the black laws and misdeeds of the
rulers.

He said that the incident was a deep rooted conspiracy hatched by
the anti-democratic elements against the elected representatives.

"The PML-N leaders are ready to defend the rights of the people as
well as prestige of the elected parliament at all costs."

PML-N chief coordinator Ahsan Iqbal said that the steps taken by
Gen Pervez Musharraf to prolong his rule by involving intelligence
agencies and armed forces could be dangerous for the federation.

Former federal minister and MNA Raja Nadir Pervez said that the
Speaker did not allow him to raise voice against the torture of
Sanaullah in National Assembly's Monday session.

Former MNAs Zafar Ali Shah, Ghulam Dastagir, Mian Abdul Mannan,
Chaudhry Safdar Rahman, Akram Ansari and others said that Mr Jamali
should not link the issue of LFO with the survival of the National
Assembly. They said that the Supreme Court decision was also being
wrongly interpreted by the rulers.

They claimed that the days of the government had been numbered.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, March 10: A senior official of the Inter-Services
Intelligence stated on Monday that Khalid Shaikh Mohammad said he
last met Osama bin Laden in December at an unknown location.

"KSM (Khalid Shaikh Mohammed) confirmed he met Osama bin Laden in
December," the ISI official told some three dozen foreign
correspondents at a briefing at the ISI headquarters.

However, Khalid Shaikh Mohammad, who was captured in an ISI-led
raid on a private home in Rawalpindi on March 1, told interrogators
that he did not know "the exact destination."

"I don't believe him unless he gives us the location," the official
said, questioning the credibility of Khalid Shaikh's revelations.

Reporters were told not to reveal the names of the three ISI
officials briefing them.

In briefing the ISI official also said that Khalid Shaikh had
handwritten letters on him which he said were from Osama bin Laden.
"He was carrying notes he claims are written by Osama bin Laden."

The ISI believes Osama bin Laden is alive following information
gathered from Khalid Shaikh and Mustafa Ahmed Al Hawsawi, an
alleged financier of the Sept 11 terror attacks who was captured
with him.

"From our intelligence gathering we feel that he is alive," the
official told the briefing. -AFP

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Qudssia Akhlaque

ISLAMABAD, March 9: Twelve Pakistani intelligence operatives
conducted the March 1 pre-dawn operation to capture Al Qaeda chief
Osama bin Laden's alleged right-hand man, Khalid Shaikh Mohammad,
investigations into the two-hour operation have revealed.

A "foreign agent" gave the tip-off to Inter-Services Intelligence
top brass, sources told Dawn.

They said the "foreign agent" was flown in "from somewhere" to
provide the intelligence about Khalid Shaikh, one of the 'most
wanted' of the Al Qaeda leadership. The reason was to avert risk of
any communication intercept by the Al Qaeda operatives in
possession of sophisticated equipment.

The agent, stated to be of United States Federal Bureau of
Investigation, informed the intelligence agency officials that
through a communication intercept, it had been learnt that Khalid
Shaikh was in transit. They were told that the authorities had four
hours as Khalid Shaikh planned to leave for an unknown destination
after that time.

Intelligence officials had the option to trail or capture Khalid
Shaikh, and they decided to go for the capture.

A 12-member squad was mobilized for the operation in the Rawalpindi
cantonment area where he was lodging. Owing to the FBI's 'big
signature,' it was decided not to include its operatives in the
squad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR, March 13: Head of the 21-member Nifaz-i-Shariat Council
has said the limited powers of the NWFP government are a hurdle in
the way of Islamization in the province.

"Only the federal government has complete authority without whose
consent it will be difficult for the provincial government to
implement all the recommendations of the council," Mufti Ghulam-ur-
Rehman, the council chief, told journalists.

"Judicial reforms top the priority list of recommendations, which
would be announced on March 18," he said.

"End of corruption and corrupt practices from society come next on
the list," he said.

The council has recommended reforms in the present police and
patwari systems, which bred corruption and undermined social
justice, he said.

"The present taxation system is unjust, which has economically
squeezed the general masses," he remarked.

The council has recommended to the MMA government some changes in
the tax system which, if implemented, would bring positive change
in society, he claimed.

"The Islamic economic experts of the council are studying the
Islamic banking system of Al-Meezan and Al-Burka banks of Karachi
and we have recommended to the government to establish an Islamic
bank in the province," Mufti Ghulam-ur-Rehman said.

The council also wanted to eliminate beggary from society and for
this purpose, it recommended setting up of rehabilitation centres
for beggars, he maintained. Such centres could also be established
for drug addicts.

"The MMA government has also been suggested to shape plans for the
promotion of cottage industry," the council head said.

Compulsory education up to primary level and elimination of child
labour from the province are two other of the council's
recommendations.

"We suggested that all the children must be sent to schools and
stipends paid to parents who partly depend on the income of their
children. We do not want economic injustice with the poor
families," Mufti Ghulam-ur-Rehman said.

All the commitments made by the provincial governments in the past
with foreign companies would be honoured, he said. However, the MMA
government has been advised to keep the interest of the local
people uppermost when entering into a fresh deal with foreign
firms, he said.

ISLAMABAD, March 13: The foreign ministers of France, Saudi Arabia

discussed with him the latest developments on the Iraqi situation.

The foreign ministers supported a peaceful solution to the Iraqi
crisis in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions.

During the 35-minute conversation with French Foreign Minister
Dominique de Villepin, the two sides agreed on the need to take
steps to create unanimity and reduce differences in the
international community on the Iraq issue in the interest of
multilateralism, international law and world peace, a Foreign
Office statement said.

"The two foreign ministers reiterated their position that the
problem of Iraq should be resolved peacefully in accordance with
the United Nations Security Council resolutions," the statement
said.

Mr Villepin while presenting his country's standpoint on the Iraqi
crisis supported the disarmament of Iraq in a peaceful way through
inspection.

According to the statement, the two ministers also exchanged views
on bilateral issues and decided to remain in touch on the Iraq
situation.

SAUDI FM: Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal held a
lengthy telephonic conversation with Mr Kasuri. In view of
fraternal bilateral relations, Mr Kasuri availed the opportunity to
brief Prince Saud on the latest developments with regard to the
issue of Iraq in the framework of Security Council and the efforts
made by Pakistan to promote a peaceful solution of the crisis.

Mr Kasuri agreed with his Saudi counterpart on the need for a
peaceful settlement of the problem to ensure unity and territorial
integrity of Iraq.

CANADIAN FM: Foreign Minister of Canada Bill Graham discussed with
Mr Kasuri ways and means of working towards an agreed approach in
the Security Council in the interest of world peace and security.

In the last few days, the foreign minister has also received
telephone calls from the foreign ministers of Russia, UK, Mexico
and Bangladesh to exchange views on the latest development in the
region.

"In these high-level diplomatic discussions, Foreign Minister
Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri has reiterated Pakistan's belief that a
peaceful solution to this crisis is still possible, and that
Pakistan will continue to play its constructive role in reducing
differences in the Security Council on the problems of Iraq in the
interest of multilateralism, international law and world peace,"

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 12: Foreign Minister Khurshid Mehmood Kasuri has
said Pakistan is behind the scene trying to get an action against
Iraq delayed to give the weapon inspectors more time to complete
their work.

Speaking to newsmen in parliament house, the foreign minister said
he was in continuous touch with the foreign ministers of many
influential countries. He told that he had talked to the Mexican
foreign minister last night and had earlier telephonic
conversations with his other counterparts, including those of
Russia, the UK and US etc.

"In view of UN chief inspector Blinx's latest report, in which he
has admitted that Iraq was implementing destruction of its long-
range missiles, the process should be given more time," Kasuri
said.

Right now, he said, the efforts made by Islamabad were aimed at
keeping unanimity of the UN Security Council intact, which was of a
pivotal importance for the future of the world peace and other
disputes as the issue of Iraq was not the last one which the world
body had to resolve.

He asserted that in the opinion of Pakistan, the UN Security
Council must not be divided on this issue and any question in
future as it might put the world peace in jeopardy. Pakistan had a
role to play in the matter, he added.

The foreign minister said that to say that Pakistan would abstain
on the resolution or give a negative vote as was demanded by the
opposition was premature since "we are unaware as yet of the total
contents of a fresh resolution moved in the Security Council".

Pakistan, he maintained, would take a decision by keeping its
national interest as well as multi-lateral interest above all other
considerations.

He strongly contested the question whether Iran and Pakistan would
be the next American targets after Iraq. Pakistan was a responsible
member of the international community as it had decidedly fulfilled
so far all its obligations, he said.

Mr Kasuri also stated that Pakistan's command and control system
was put in place two years ahead of India, which had been
acknowledged and commended by international defence journals
including Jane Defence journal.

Pakistan's defence programme, he said, was transparent and
therefore it was known to all about the Pakistani weapons which
were in safe hands."It was not helping any country in this
connection including Iran," he said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD, March 11: Religious parties asked the government to go
further than abstaining from a United Nations Security Council vote
on war on Iraq and cast an outright 'no' vote against military
action.

"Pakistan as a member of the Security Council should boldly say no
to any move for war," Hafiz Hussain Ahmed, secretary-general of
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam told AFP.

The cabinet decided unanimously late Monday to abstain from the
vote, expected this week, on a draft resolution by the United
States, Britain and Spain authorising military action, PML-Q
senator Mushahid Hussain told AFP.

Pakistan is one of the council's 10 rotating members and has
resisted playing its card on how it would vote.

A senior official from the PML-Q said the decision was taken to
avoid "a serious public backlash."

Religious parties have led two massive rallies in the past 10 days
against war on Iraq, drawing hundreds of thousands onto the
streets.

"Pakistan is a nuclear power and a member of UN security council
and it should have courage to say what millions of Pakistani have
said during the protests in Karachi and Rawalpindi," Mr Ahmed said.

"God has provided this opportunity to Pakistan. The whole Muslim
world is pinning great hopes on us, so we should play our role
instead of avoiding voting against the resolution."

Abstention was not enough for the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal,
spokesman Shahid Shamsi said. "The stand of the MMA is clear: it
wants a big 'no' vote by Pakistan," Mr Shamsi told AFP.

<a name="cabi">Cabinet reviews Iraq situation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 10: The federal cabinet held an emergency meeting
here and discussed the latest situation on Iraq. The meeting
presided over by Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali was
briefed on the emergent situation on the Baghdad issue.

According to an official announcement, the cabinet unanimously
decided to continue to base Pakistan's position on Iraq on
principles while keeping in view the national interest.

Islamabad has consistently stated that Iraq must comply with the
all relevant Security Council resolutions. "Also that peace must be
given a chance and all options for peaceful solution must be
explored," the government is of the view.

PML-Q President Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain also attended the meeting
on a special invitation.

The prime minister emphasised that Pakistan's position on the issue
would be based on principles and not on expediency. He said that as
a leader of an elected government, that drew its strength from the
people, he would also be taking the nation into confidence shortly
on every important issue.

Informed sources said it was a consensus at the meeting that
Pakistan should not support the new US resolution as it would not
go well with the people.

They said that almost all the ministers expressed their point of
view and said the best option was that Pakistan should abstain from
the voting. It was also said that let other countries, especially
France and Russia, take a firm stand over the issue.

In case of a veto by France or Russia, the meeting was told,
Pakistan could save its position in the eyes of Bush administration

<a name="pind">Pindi march opposes war</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Bakhtawar Mian

RAWALPINDI, March 9: Tens of thousands of followers of opposition
parties marched in Rawalpindi to oppose a possible US-led war
against Iraq.

The march, organised by the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) as part
of its "million march" protest series and joined by some other
opposition groups, was one of the biggest held in Rawalpindi.

The marchers, many of them coming from other cities and towns of
Punjab and the NWFP, formed a huge rally on the city's main Murree
Road where party leaders blasted what they saw as anti-Muslim
polices of US President George W. Bush.

They urged Pakistan's government to oppose the US moves for war at
the 15-member UN Security Council, where Pakistan is at present a
non-permanent member.

The march started from Liaquat Bagh and terminated about two
kilometre north of there outside the city's main Rawalpindi General
Hospital where protest leaders made their speeches from an overhead
bridge.

The protesters wore head-bands and carried banners and placards
inscribed with slogans calling for peace and condemning the US
policies.

"We want peace", "No war for oil", "Bush is today's Pharaoh" read
some of them. Some carried cartoons showing Bush sipping human
blood. A Bush effigy was also burnt.

The speakers also targeted President Pervez Musharraf for offering
Pakistan's help in the US-led military operation in Afghanistan and
some expressed fears that another Muslim country could be the next
target after Iraq.

MMA chief Maulana Shah Ahmad Noorani said the whole world was up
against American war plans. He said a regime change in Iraq was
just an excuse to achieve what he called the real US ambition of
capturing oil deposits in the Middles East and strengthening
Israel.

"Bush wants to change the map of the Middle East but it is not so
easy as all the Muslims would present a united front. It is our
religious and moral responsibility to back the Iraqi Muslims," he
said.

MMA parliamentary leader Qazi Hussain Ahmad urged Muslims to unite
against what he called "imperialist tendencies" of President Bush.

He said President Musharraf must clarify his policy on Iraq and
that Pakistan must vote against the US-sponsored resolution in the
UNSC for an attack on Iraq.

MMA secretary-general Maulana Fazlur Rehman criticized Gen
Musharraf and said army generals had damaged the country in one way
or another. He cited the 1971 war in which East Pakistan was lost
and the Indian incursion into the Siachen glacier in the 1980s.

He also accused the generals of a role in what he called
destruction of Afghanistan by siding with "aggressors" and said
they should review their policies and play a role that should be
acceptable to the nation.

Giving FBI a free hand is equal to selling away the country's
sovereignty, he said. The rally was also addressed by Pakistan
Muslim League-N acting president Javed Hashmi and Pakistan Tehrik-
i-Insaaf chief Imran Khan.

A large number of women also participated in the protest march. A
heavy contingent of police had been deployed at different points to
avoid any untoward incident.

<a name="draf">Draft asks Iraqis to revolt: Pakistan denies attribution</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Corresponent

UNITED NATIONS, March 8: Pakistani diplomats at the United Nations
were caught by surprise when an alternative draft resolution on
Iraq attributed to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia surfaced.

Pakistan's ambassador Munir Akram denied any connection to the
paper, which, he called, was "one of many ideas floating around."
Pakistan didn't plan to introduce any draft unless Arab ambassadors
could persuade the major council powers to support it, the diplomat
said.

The two-page proposal, which some diplomats said might have been
floated by Saudi Arabia, was designed to encourage Iraqis to revolt
against the regime rather than face war.

Pakistan's name was attributed to the draft because it is a Muslim
country, a member of the UN Security Council and seeks a peaceful
resolution of the Iraqi crisis, diplomats reflected.

The draft offers amnesty to all Iraqi officials who would cooperate
with inspectors and suggests that force can be used to protect
Iraqi people facing threat from their own regime.

Mr Akram said many Arab and other Muslim countries were floating
such ideas to see whether they could gather any momentum.

Referring to the US resolution, Mr Akram said it needed more work
and possibly a wider deadline in order for the United States to win
the nine votes it needs for the resolution's adoption.

<a name="aske">Govt asked to reverse pro-US policies</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, March 9: The chief of Tehrik-i-Insaf, Imran Khan, has
asked the government not to vote for any Security Council
resolution that would allow aggression against Iraq.

Pakistan's stand must be based on principles and it must act as per
the aspirations of the people who are opposed to the American
policies vis-a-vis Iraq, said Mr Khan while addressing the Head and
Neck Oncology Society of Pakistan on Pakistan in the evolving
international crises.

The PTI chief was highly critical of the government for "not
protecting the fundamental rights of the people and giving in too
much to the Americans" and opined that the "leadership is so
petrified of the Americans that they are not standing up for their
rights."

He said that Islamabad did not support terrorism in any form, yet
Pakistanis were being treated as suspects after the 9/11 incident
and that they were being subjected to questionable treatment in the
United States. The sad part is, he said, that the government here
had not raised its voice over it to protect the rights of its
citizen.

"What is the use of living in a country which does not protect your
fundamental rights," said the disgusted Khan while referring, what
he described as "the government's failure in restraining the
Americans from uncalled for treatment being meted out to
Pakistanis."

The PTI chief advised the government not to obey the Americans'
orders. "Pakistani agencies do whatever the Americans ask them to
do. They get away with it because the people are poor and nobody
speaks for them," he regretted.

He also referred to the massive anti-war rallies in Europe and
claimed that they disproved the clash of civilization theory. "I
believe that the US, the only super power, is controlled by the
Zionists and President Bush is surrounded by the fundamentalists,"
he maintained.

He acknowledged that doctors of Pakistani origin had been
experiencing an adverse fallout of the 9/11 incident because of the
restrictive American policies.

<a name="asif">Asif not produced in court despite 270 orders</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Tahir Siddiqui

KARACHI, March 13: The five different courts, trying Asif Ali
Zardari, husband of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, in six
cases have issued over 270 orders for his production in court
during the past two years. None of the orders has been complied
with.

The court issued as many as 25 orders for the production of Mr
Zardari in court in the Murtaza murder case, being tried by the
district and sessions judge, East, Sain Ali Dino Matilo, at the
Central Prison, Karachi.

The case was transferred to the district and sessions judge, East,
in August, 2001 after Judge Yasmin Abbasi of the Small Causes Court
had refused to try it some six months before its transfer due to
the "non-cooperation of the prosecution and defence lawyers."

Asif Zardari, Shoaib Suddle, then DIG Karachi, Wajid Durrani, then
senior superintendent of police, South, Masood Sharif, then chief
of the Intelligence Bureau, Shahid Hiyat, then SP of Saddar, Rai
Mohammed Tahir, then ASP of Darkhshan, Shabbir Ahmed Qaimkhani,
then SHO of Garden police station, Agha Mohammed Jameel, then SHO
of Napier PS, ASI Abdul Basit, head constables Muslim Shah and
Faisal Hafeez and constables Zafar Iqbal, Zulfiqar Ahmed, Ghulam
Mustafa, Ahmed Khan, Raja Hameed, Gulzar Khan, Zakir Mehmood and
Ghulam Shabbir were the arrested accused in the case. They all have
been granted bail.

The trial of the Murtaza Bhutto murder case has come to a halt
since the deposition of the 17th out of the total 223 prosecution
witnesses due to the non-production of the prime accused, Asif
Zardari, in the court.

The court had recorded the statement of Ghulam Mustafa, a worker of
Mir Murtaza and an eyewitness in the case, in July 2000, but the PW
is yet to be cross-examined by the defence counsel.

Mr Zardari, who was granted bail in the case in December last year,
has not been produced in the court despite repeated notices to the
jail authorities and the Sindh home department for his production
in the court.

Later, he was charge-sheeted in the container case, Justice Nizam
murder case, attempt to commit suicide cases, Alam Baloch murder
case, SGC reference, ARY Gold reference, tractor reference, Sajjad
Hussain murder case and Polo Ground reference.

Mr Zardari, being represented by Shahadat Awan in Karachi, was
booked in 11 cases, including the Justice Nizam murder case and
attempt to commit suicide cases, during the Nawaz Sharif
government. He was booked in the Polo Ground reference and in the
Sajjad Hussain murder case after the dismissal of the Nawaz
government.

On May 10, 1999 the police obtained his remand in the Justice Nizam
murder case. During his remand, he was booked in two cases of
attempt to commit suicide on May 17 and May 19.

The court issued as many as 122 orders for the production of Mr
Zardari in the Justice Nizam murder case, being tried in the
district and session court, Central, headed by Judge Zafar Ahmed
Sherwani.

The police submitted the final charge-sheets in the attempt to
commit suicide cases in the court of the Judicial Magistrate, Syeda
Perveen Shah, who issued as many as 105 orders for the production
in the court of ailing Asif Zardari, who at present is lodged in
the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences at Islamabad, under the
custody of Attock Jail.

On March 11, an additional district and sessions judge, South,
Farooq Ali Channa, directed the provincial authorities of Punjab
and Sindh to ensure the production of Mr Zardari in Sajjad Hussain
murder case in his court on March 31.

<a name="freq">Frequency coordination for Paksat-1 achieved</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 8: Information Technology and Telecommunications
Minister Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari said the country had achieved
frequency coordination for the Paksat-1 communication satellite.

Terming the event a breakthrough, the minister while briefing
newsmen at his office, said now all the 34 transponders could be
used optimally and the expectation of generating revenues was
possible by aggressively marketing its potential.

The satellite could only be utilized after removing frequency
constraint by making it coordinated with neighbouring satellites,
he said.

We could now put together a more viable business plan for the
follow-up satellite, especially when we have three to five years to
work on it, Mr Leghari said.

He said the opportunity gave the government more space in getting
partners and the ability to acquire funding for building and
launching the country's own satellite, besides developing necessary
capabilities.

He said the breakthrough came after President Gen Pervez
Musharraf's visit to Russia, after which the Russian ambassador was
involved in a dialogue, though a team was involved in meeting
international operators over the last few months.

The Paksat-1 was positioned in the slot allocated for Pakistan at
38 degrees east, in a geosynchronous orbit, 36,000km above the
earth.

The government hopes to use the satellite for educational intranet,
virtual university, tele-medicine, internet bandwidth, video
conferencing and private channels. It will also cover Africa, Iran,
Afghanistan, Russia and India.

The satellite has been leased for 5 years at an initial cost of
$4.5 million, while $30 million has to be paid in 5 years.

The government is planning for a follow-on satellite to fully
exploit the slot that might cost $250 million and for which PC-1
has been forwarded to Executive Committee of National Economic
Council.

The minister said that the satellite had 34 transponders and a
capacity of 1.3 gigahertz. Through this capacity, 220 satellite
television channels could be run simultaneously and it is three
times the total Internet bandwidth coming into the country.

The minister said that though country had the satellite and it
could file with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU),
the ability to use its potential was dependent on the ability to
co-ordinate with operators of nearby satellites or those who had
priority.

He said the location of the satellite was very valuable since it
could cover the region from the tip of South Africa to the Far
East.

The minister said he would hold meetings with different ministries
to take benefit of e-governance and satellite. Health and education
ministries, the higher education commission and Virtual University
could take advantage of the satellite, he said.

He said the private sector, especially the private TV channels,
would be encouraged to utilize the satellite through commercial
packages.

<a name="nabp">NAB plea to revoke exemption dismissed: Hashmi's reference</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

LAHORE, March 10: An accountability court dismissed a NAB's
application, requesting court to withdraw exemption granted to PML-
N acting president Makhdoom Javed Hashmi from personal appearance
in a corruption reference filed against him.

The court had dispensed with the appearance of Hashmi, after he
returned to the National Assembly in the October last, due to his
official engagements in Islamabad.

NAB contended that court could not grant exemption from personal
appearance to one accused, saying more than one accused arraigned
in a case could be granted such exemption.

NAB counsel Asad Manzoor Butt argued that the accused had not been
exempted for an indefinite period, and his personal appearance in
court at this stage of trial was a must.

Defence counsel Manzoor Malik contended that once the exemption had
been granted to the accused, it could not be revoked by the trial
court. NAB's section 17 authorised the court to exempt from
personal appearance an accused with reasons to be recorded, and the
prosecution could not oppose such exemption once granted, the
counsel said.

He also argued that NAB could not challenge the exemption in the
trial court, which could not review its orders. However, he should
move the appellate court for this purpose, he added.

The court dismissed NAB's plea, observing that it could not go
beyond its jurisdiction in revoking its own orders regarding the
accused's exemption from personal appearance. It also observed that
the accused was being represented through a pleader and his
conduct, following the grant of exemption from personal appearance,
did not warrant the withdrawal of this privilege. The proceedings
were adjourned for March 24.

Makhdoom Javed Hashmi has been accused of illegally acquiring
movable and immovable assets worth Rs38 million, abusing his
official position from 1991 to 1999.

Mr Hashmi has also been accused of living beyond his means, as he
failed to account for the assets during investigation.

<a name="7kil">7 killed in Sargodha Imambargah stampede</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sajjad Abbas Niazi

SARGODHA, March 13: Seven people, including two children, were
killed and 20 others injured in a stampede caused by a fire broke
out in an Imambargah on Khushab Road.

A 'majlis' of women was in progress at the upper storey of the
Block-7 Imambargah when tents erected on the terrace reportedly
caught fire. It caused a stampede as everyone tried to rush down
the stairs. Four women - Nasreen, Kausar, Razia and Shazia - and
two children, Ali Zargham and Iqra, died on the spot.

Some 20 injured were taken to the DHQ hospital where a woman, wife
of Mantaq, died while condition of three others was stated to be
critical till the filing of this report.

The injured included Bakhat Bibi, Shazia Batool, Kalsoom Bibi,
Faiza Batool, Nusrat, Kaneez, Bilqees, Iram, Ansar, Ghulam Mustafa,
Nazar Husain, Shamim Kausar and Faiz Bibi.

Some women reportedly jumped from the upper storey and sustained
fractures.

Police highups, including the DIG and the SSP, reached the spot and
told newsmen that the fire broke out due to short circuit.

Local Shia leaders, however, did not agree with the administration
and demanded an "impartial inquiry" to determine the cause of the
blaze.

They did not allow the autopsy of the bodies and also refused to
accept their custody, saying they were waiting for an advice from
their high command.

Sargodha Nazim Amjad Ali Noon quoted majlis organizer Ghulam
Shabbir as saying that it was purely an accident. "He has given it
in writing to the administration," he told Dawn.

COMPENSATION: Chief Minister Pervaiz Elahi, expressing his sorrow
and grief over the incident, announced a special grant of Rs100,000
each for the heirs of the deceased, Rs50,000 for each injured and
Rs10,000 for those sustaining minor injuries.

This was stated by the provincial minister for irrigation while
talking to Dawn.

The minister said it was mere an accident and could not be linked
to the Wednesday's shooting in Miani, Bhera, which left over dozen
injured. He said there were over 500 women and children attending
the majlis on the upper story which had room for 200 people only.
He said the fire might have been caused by heat generated by
searchlights hung close to the tents.

LAHORE, March 13: Shahida Parveen, a classical and folk singer,
died of kidney failure after a week-long illness. She was 50.

She was admitted to Shaikh Zayed Hospital last week with kidney
problem. After some initial improvement, her condition deteriorated
on Wednesday and she died at 2am. She was buried at 3pm on
Thursday.

Known for her skill on classical genre of music, Shahida Parveen
made her mark by singing sufi poetry as well. Mainly trained by her
late mother, Zahida Parveen - a noted singer in the 1950s and 60s
in her own right - Shahida Parveen also got education in music from
Patiala Gharana. She was a disciple of Akhtar Ali Khan, father of
Amanat Ali Khan and Hamid Ali Khan.

"Shahida was one of those rare people who started singing after
learning the skill," said Farukh Bashir of the PTV. Education in
music had refined her personality to a great extent, meaning
thereby that she had absorbed music in its all manifestations and
forms. She was one of those singer who did not need on-job-training
like many of her contemporaries, Mr Bashir added.

<a name="ital">Italian firm's request registered at world body</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Rafaqat Ali

ISLAMABAD, March 10: The International Chamber for Settlement of
Investment Disputes has registered the request of Italian
contractor of the Ghazi Barotha project for arbitration after
overruling Pakistan's objections to its jurisdiction.

Official sources told Dawn that Pakistan was intimated by the ICSID
secretariat that it had registered the request of Impregilo, the
Italian contractor, for arbitration and Pakistan should raise the
objection to the jurisdiction of the tribunal before the tribunal
itself.

The Italian contractor has approached the ICSID, which works under
the umbrella of World Bank, demanding $450 million from the
government of Pakistan.

The government in its preliminary objections before the ICSID at
Washington had stated that under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention the jurisdiction of the centre did not extend to Wapda
as it was not a constituent subdivision or agency of Pakistan and
had not been designated to the ICSID by Pakistan.

The government has been informed that the ICSID had noted that the
request was against the government and not against Wapda.

The sources maintain that just the registration of the request
would force the government to spend a few millions of dollars.

After registration of the request both the parties are required to
deposit $100,000 as fee, besides engaging foreign lawyers having
necessary qualification to take up cases at the ICSID.

This is the second application for arbitration filed by a foreign
company engaged for projects in Pakistan which has been registered
by the ICSID. The request of Turkish company Bayinder has so far
not been registered.

The Italian contractor has claimed that Wapda is in serious breach
of contractual commitments and is also responsible for denial of
justice to it by frustrating the contractual dispute resolution
mechanism.

Now both Pakistan and the Impregilo will appoint an arbitrator
each. Neither party can appoint one of its nationals as arbitrator.
The two arbitrators will by mutual agreement appoint a chairman. If
they fail to agree then the chairman will be nominated by the
ICSID.

At present Pakistan has investment protection treaties with 43
countries. Majority of these agreements were signed in the 90s
without properly defining what was meant by investment.

Unlike other countries, Pakistan never protected its foreign
assets. If a suit is decreed by the ICSID, the other party can ask
for the execution of the treaty by identifying Pakistan's assets.

Pakistan's foreign assets include its reserves in the Reserve Bank
of America, PIA's fleet, PNSC ships and embassies.

The countries with which Pakistan has investment treaty are
Germany, Romania, Sweden, Kuwait, France, South Korea, the
Netherlands, China, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Spain, Turkmenistan,
United Kingdom, Singapore, Turkey, Portugal, Malaysia, Switzerland,
Kyrgyz Republic, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, UAE, Iran, Indonesia,
Tunisia, Syria, Denmark, Belarus, Mauritius, Italy, Oman, Sri
Lanka, Australia, Japan, Belgium, Qatar, Philippine, Yemen, Egypt,
Lebanon, Morocco, and Bosnia-Herzegovina.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Nasir Iqbal

ISLAMABAD, March 10: The National Assembly was informed that
Pakistan International Airlines was considering selling Roosevelt
Hotel in New York.

In response to a question of PPP's Syed Naveed Qamar, Defence
Minister Rao Sikandar Iqbal said in a written reply that a
Roosevelt Task Force (RTF) was constituted under the terms of the
shareholders agreement on June 2001.

The RTF was given a clear mandate for taking all decisions for
reaching the best possible sale price for the Roosevelt Hotel in a
minimum period of time.

About advertisement for the selection of a financial adviser for
the property, he said the RTF at its meeting on April 28, 2002,
decided to accelerate the process for the appointment of an
Investment Adviser (IA).

In this connection, the Saudi representatives proposed that the RTF
contained previous shortlist of companies presented to the PIAIL
Board in April 2001. This list had been arrived at by a careful
consideration of previous proposals received by the PIAIL and the
Privatisation Commission. The RTF also took under consideration the
cost factor and the time involved in going to the press.

It was decided not to go to the press for advertisement, he said,
adding that 15 top companies were short-listed. These companies
were issued Letters of Invitation (LoIs) for submitting their
technical offers and financial bids separately. Only nine
participated.

He said that the results of the technical analysis and financial
scrutiny were combined and the resultant scores were
calculated/tabulated in accordance with the process laid down in
the LoI. Eastdil Realty Co. LLC was finally selected as the
Investment Adviser for the sale of Roosevelt Hotel, the minister
said.

BAHAWALPUR, March 13: The "world's tallest woman" has expressed
resentment over the publication of her photograph in the Guinness
Book of World Records without her permission and threatened the
Guinness Book management with a law suit if she does not get due
monetary benefits within a month.

Speaking at a press conference in the presence of seven-foot-two
Zainab Bibi who is illiterate, her promoter Asghar Bahawalpuri said
that the photo, which appeared on page 51 of the Guinness Book's
2003 edition, was taken in Jordan about a year ago, from where it
was presumably provided to the book management by the photographer
without Zainab's permission and knowledge.

The photo of 28-year-old Zainab has been published along with that
of Pakistan's tallest man Azad Khan Masood of South Waziristan
Agency who is seven feet eight inches tall.

Mr Asghar regretted that Zainab's introduction had not been carried
by the Guinness Book 2003 along with the photograph.

Ms Zainab claimed that the book management paid around $6,000 to
people whose photographs and introduction were published in the
book.

She told questioners that she had visited a number of countries to
project the country abroad. She used the money she had earned
abroad to build herself a house in Chak 285/GB in Toba Tek Singh

<a name="prov">Provinces seek relief for next fiscal year: formula being drawn</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Sabihuddin Ghausi

KARACHI, March 11: The meeting of the federal and provincial
finance ministers in Islamabad has failed to pacify the provinces
and three provinces - Sindh, Balochistan and NWFP - are all set to
demand a financial compensation from federal government for their
next fiscal year's budgets.

The Sindh government has already placed a compensation demand of
Rs3.4 billion from Islamabad for the current fiscal year and
exercises are being made to work out a demand for next year's
budget.

Aftab Sheikh, Adviser on Finance to Sindh Chief Minister is
briefing his cabinet colleagues next Tuesday in Karachi on the
resources distribution issue. The cabinet is expected to draw up a
strategy to demand a compensation from Islamabad and setting in
place a new NFC formula in which provinces should get more than 50
per cent of the total taxation pool and Islamabad should get less
than 50 per cent.

"Real nation-building task is done by the provinces while Islamabad
is looking after only debt servicing, defence and administrative
expenditure," he told Dawn.

He said all the four provinces including Punjab were unanimous in
their demand of getting more than 50 per cent from the federal
taxation pool and allowing Islamabad to retain less than 50 per
cent.

Aftab Sheikh also wants a fair distribution of over Rs400 billion
non-taxation revenue of Islamabad among the four provinces of the
federal government.

He is expected to visit Quetta, Peshawar and Lahore in his efforts
to strike a consensus among the provinces on ticklish resources
distribution arrangement. Aftab Sheikh had invited the finance
ministers of the three provinces in Karachi last month who had
demanded a new NFC quickly.

In meeting, the federal government has indicated the formation of a
new NFC and has asked the provinces to nominate their non-official
statutory members on the Commission. Going by the experiences of
the previous six NFCs, the next Commission would take more than one
year to finalize award if the political leadership manage to reach
some consensus.

After taking over in October 1999, the military government
constituted NFC in 2000. The NFC remained a painfully slow affair
for more than one and a half year. As many as half a dozen meetings
were held in 2002 and a last meeting was to finalize the award was
scheduled to be held in Lahore on October 25 last year. This
meeting was called off after the then Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz
left this unfinished task to the new elected political leaders.

The last NFC in its unfinished award has retained population as the
basis of resources distribution among the provinces but has hinted
at moving towards multiple denominations including economic
backwardness, size of the province and the revenue generation
capacity in next NFC then scheduled in the year 2007.

An annual subvention pool of Rs20 billion was proposed to be set up
for compensating Sindh, NWFP and Balochistan. In addition Rs32
billion collected from 2.5 per cent additional GST was also to be
distributed among the provinces. However, there was no consensus
among the provinces on distribution of Rs32 billion. Besides, the
Wapda was expected to work out profit distribution with the NWFP.

In the post election development after October 2002, the finance
ministers of three provinces have already demanded new resources
distribution arrangement in which population should not be the only
criterion. On January 31 last, the treasury and opposition benches
in Sindh Assembly joined hands to unanimously pass a very strong
resolution on resources distribution. It stipulates an altogether
new concept of resources distribution which reflects the changing
mood of the people of smaller provinces.

The three provinces Sindh, Balochistan and NWFP are all set to
demand a financial compensation from Islamabad for their next
fiscal year's budget because the validity of the 1997 National
Finance Commission award expired in June 2002 and there is no
possibility of a new resource distribution arrangement being worked
out in next few months.

Sindh has already placed a compensation demand for Rs3.4 billion
for the current fiscal year ending next June and exercise is under
way to work out compensation demand for 2003-04.

The year 2003-04 will be second consecutive year when provinces are
being forced to draw up their budgets on the basis of 1997 NFC
Award, which has lost constitutional validity in June 2002.

<a name="tofa">$ to fall as SBP slows buying from banks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, March 10: The State Bank will allow the US dollar to lose
some of its extra weight this month as keeping the buck
artificially stable has started hurting the exporters - for whose
benefit the SBP has been defending the US currency.

"Ironically the policy of defending the buck too aggressively has
started hurting the same people for whom the policy was put in
place," said a senior banker close to State Bank. He said the
central bank has realized this and indications are that it would
allow the greenback to lose some of its extra weight this month.

Let us see how the SBP policy of keeping the dollar above a certain
level - or defending it in bankers jargon - has started hurting the
exporters. Bankers say lately forward price of the dollar in all
tenure has fallen below its spot price because it has been kept
stable for quite some time giving rise to hopes that it would
surely come down in coming months. So strong are the fears of a
future fall of the buck that importers are not making forward
purchases even at a discounted price.

This being the scenario the exporters who had been the prime
beneficiary of the State Bank policy to defend the dollar have now
become unable to sell future export proceeds to avoid taking the
exchange rate loss. If this situation persists for some time it
would start pinching the exporters. Though not all exporters
realize this those who have enough knowledge of foreign exchange
market say their community should no more insist for keeping the
buck stable through artificial means.

"There is a limit to every thing," said a big textile exporter
well-versed with the nitty-gritty of the foreign exchange market.
"Keeping the dollar stable for too long a period has resulted in
the situation where the forward premiums have turned negative -
threatening to hurt us," he remarked.

Exporters do realize that letting the dollar some extra weight now
is also going to hurt them in a way - that is it would reduce their
current export earnings to some extent besides impacting on their
competitive edge over the rivals. But bankers say since the SBP
would allow the buck shed extra value in phases - and not at once -
the exchange rate loss to the exporters would be limited. On the
other hand if the SBP keeps the dollar still stable by continued
aggressive dollar buying from banks "one day the bubble will burst"
- forcing the dollar to a unmanageable low all of a sudden.

Exporters have been used to selling future export proceeds at a
premium in times when the rupee used to shed value against the buck
as a matter of routine. But even after the things changed for the
better - in the wake of 9/11 they did not stop it though the
premiums started falling as the fears of rupee depreciation were
mitigated by unusually higher inflows of foreign exchange.

Selling future export proceeds or discounting the export bills - in
bankers jargon - enables the exporters to meet their day to day
cash requirements. Hence the continuation of the practice.

According to the State Bank statistics the stock of overdue export
bills was minus $91 million at end-December last year. This means
exporters had made a net export bills discounting of $91 million
between July-December 2002.

Top bankers close to SBP say the central bank's high-ups have
realized this and several other negative aspects of keeping the
dollar in oxygen tent for too long. They say it is in this
background that the central bank has decided to slow down its US
dollar buying from the inter-bank market to let the greenback lose
some of its extra weight.

SBP officials decline to comment on this issue but top bankers say
they have got indications that the central bank would not defend
the dollar as aggressively in March as in the previous months.

The bankers say Adviser to Prime Minister on Finance Shaukat Aziz
has been apprised of the problems facing the banks due to an over-
valued dollar. "The adviser has assured us that while keeping the
dollar stable at a certain level the SBP would not ignore its
fallout on the banks operations," said head of a local bank. Aziz
had met top bankers in Karachi during his weekend visit and asked
them to expedite credit disbursement to avoid booking losses on
their books due to falling yield on government treasury bills.

Aziz could not be reached immediately for his comments. Senior
bankers say SBP high-ups have also passed on a word down the line
that the policy of defending the dollar should be revisited in the
light of emerging inter-bank market situation. This is a reference
to forward premiums turning negative and thus threatening the
exporters as well as to rising level of liquidity partly due to
aggressive dollar buying by the central bank.

"So on both counts there is a case for having a new level to defend
the dollar at," says a senior banker close to SBP. But naturally
nobody knows what this level would be. The SBP has already shown a
shift in its policy by letting the dollar trade below Rs 58 these
days and by minimising its dollar buying from the banking system in
March.

Bankers say the central bank that purchased more than $310 million
in January-February this year has bought only $40 million so far
this month. These bankers say in addition to the factors discussed
above an IMF observation on the State Bank policy of excessive
dollar buying from the system has also led the central bank to
revisit this policy.

The IMF while approving the fifth tranche of poverty reduction and
growth facility early this month observed that the policy was
proving costly "as rupee funds being spent to buy dollars from
banks was but "a non-priority expenditure."

<a name="oman">Oman plans investment in Balochistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Khaleeq Kiani

ISLAMABAD, March 9: Oman is planning significant investment in
Balochistan, including in the expansion of Gwadar airport and
construction of jetties at Gwadar port.

A number of investment projects would come under discussion when
Pakistan-Oman Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) meets here on
Monday.

Adviser to the prime minister on finance Shaukat Aziz would lead
Pakistani side while Sheikh Bin Hilal Bin Ali Al-Khalili, Minister
of Agriculture & Fisheries of the Sultanate of Oman would lead his
eight-member delegation.

The two sides would cover areas of mutual interest and economic
cooperation relating to the improvement of air-traffic between the
national carriers of the two countries.

The fourth session of the JMC would discuss projects relating to
the extension of Gwadar airport, upgraduation of Gwadar hospital,
construction of seven jetties at the Gwadar Port, provision of 100
engines by Oman to the fishermen and augmentation of water supply
schemes in Balochistan.

The JMC would finalise projects for a $7 million grant announced by
Sultan of Oman during his visit to Pakistan in April 2001. The
Omanese government has already provided 43 new generators to the
province.

For the utilization of the grant, Pakistan has already furnished
projects relating to the construction of Gwadar-Hoshab Road, Water
Supply Scheme from Shadi Kaur Dam to Pasni town, construction of
three irrigation dams and replacement of pipes from Akrakaur Dam to
Gwadar and Jiwani towns.

Oman has sought to benefit from Pakistanis' experience in light and
medium industry for the development of Omani industrial sector.

Oman is also keen on having joint projects for investment in the
agricultural, livestock and industrial sectors. The two sides would
also discuss setting up of industrial units in the free trade
zones.

President Gen Pervez Musharraf visited Oman in June, 2000. The
visit was reciprocated by Sultan Qaboos Bin Said in April, 2001.

During the visit, Sultan Qaboos announced a grant of $50 million
for long-term assistance to Balochistan.

As a result, $12.5 million were provided for the setting up of
Pakistan-Oman Investment Company. Additionally, $3.5 million were
provided by Oman to set up two Information Technology (IT) chairs
in the name of Sultan Qaboos Bin Said at the University of
Engineering and Technology, Lahore and at the NED University,
Karachi.

'<a name="blac">Blackened man, blackened woman'</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ardeshir Cowasjee

Amidst the chaos, non-functioning, the shouting, unruly and
unparliamentary behaviour of the majority of the elected
representatives, men and women, in the National Assembly, thirty-
five (out of a total of 139) of the more sensible and realistic
women representatives sitting in our provincial assemblies who wish
to achieve something other than disruption met last week at Karachi
at an orientation workshop organized by the Jinnah Institute
(London-based) and the Westminster Foundation for Democracy.

For most of these women, legislation and representation are a
totally new phase in their lives, unknown ground whereon they have
not trodden. So political orientation is called for if they are to
make any mark in the assemblies. Though it must be said that at the
present moment, with the amazing scenes we are witnessing in
parliament, it is doubtful if it will be possible to even make a
point, let alone legislate.

However, the women have never been such a force with which to
reckon and it is now up to them to make their mark. As pointed out
so rightly by the chairperson of the workshop, MNA Sherry Rahman,
when it comes to women's rights, it must be remembered that they
are not an issue on their own but are very much part of the whole
that is known as human rights. Women are not divorced from
humanity. And until there is a vast improvement in the state of
human rights in this country, it is highly doubtful that the status
of women can be raised.

Education is a human right. According to the latest statistics,
female literacy in Pakistan stands at a pathetic 28 per cent, way
below the Third World average of 66 per cent. Without literacy what
hope have our women of pulling themselves out of the morass dug for
them by the illiterate male population in thrall to uneducated
bigots, the misinterpretation of religion, and outmoded tribal and
feudal customs and traditions?

We will obviously expect our women legislators to lay stress on the
women factor when fighting for human rights and we will expect the
few who can to enforce legislation for the protection of women, for
compulsory female education, for the repeal of the iniquitous
Hadood Ordinances, and particularly for the eradication of one of
the greatest crimes committed against the women of this country -
the condonation of the feudal custom of karo-kari, literally
'blackened man, blackened woman', but in the observance of which
custom the man generally goes away scot free while the woman loses
her life.

With the population explosion and the concurrent reduction in
literacy rates, the instances of karo-kari are reportedly on the
rise. It is a practice translated into English, erroneously, as
'honour killings' in which there is no honour involved at all. It
is a practice that is also widely abused and has been known to be
used to get rid of women unwanted for one reason or another, or
merely suspected of having committed adultery, or even of having
had an innocent conversation with a member of the opposite sex.
Targets of the practice may include a three-year old girl or an
eighty-five-year old woman.

In 1998, 286 such killings were reported in Punjab alone. In 1999,
in a three-month period in Sindh 132 women were done to death in
the name of honour, and in Punjab in eleven months 266 deaths were
reported.

According to a February 2003 press release by Madadgaar, an
organization funded by UNICEF: "....during the last year in Sindh
423 cases of karo-kari were reported; in Punjab 319, in Balochistan
36, while in the NWFP 45 such cases were reported in the print
media. A comparison of data collected in 2002 and 2001 shows that
the trend remains the same and most of the cases were reported from
Sindh. In 2001, the print media reported 453 cases in Sindh, 204 in
Punjab, 69 in Balochistan and 27 in the NWFP. .... The monitoring
of all the reported cases revealed that in 346 cases the
perpetrator was the husband; in 183 cases a brother; in 92 cases
in-laws; in 46 cases the father; and in 32 cases the perpetrator
was a son."

One honour killing that was highlighted internationally was that of
Samia Sarwar in 1999 whose murder at the hands of a relative was
sanctioned by her mother. It was not until the year 2000 following
persistent protests by women activists that karo-kari was finally
declared by the government to be murder. However, apparently
neither the police nor the judiciary have taken any action against
the perpetrators of this particularly barbaric practice.

Advocate Iqbal Haider, the former Senator, who went out on a limb
in 1999 to have the matter discussed and debated in the Senate but
whose attempts were nullified by his fellow Senators and the
honourable chairman of the Senate, Wasim Sajjad, has now come up
with a proposed draft resolution, drafted at the behest of his
former fellow partyman, MPA Nisar Khuhro, for the women
parliamentarians to present in their respective assemblies:

"This house expresses its deep concern over the unchecked and
unabated spate of violence against women and condemns premeditated
murder of women in the name of so-called honour, karo-kari,
siyahkari or on any other pretext. This house calls upon the
government:

"(a) To ensure immediate registration of FIR in all incidents of
such murders and arrest of the culprits, failing which the
concerned police officers must be prosecuted for aiding and
abetting in such crimes and must also be dismissed from service;

"(b) To ensure expeditious trial of such murder cases and severe
exemplary punishment of the culprits;

"(c) To ensure that murder of women in the name of so-called
honour, karo-kari, siyahkari, or any other such pretext is made a
non-compoundable offence, so that no pardon or concession is
granted to the culprit through any family settlement.

"(d) To ensure that women are not treated or used as compensation
or fine for payment in all or any transaction, including honour
killing settlement, which amounts to trafficking in human flesh,
and an offence under the Pakistan Penal Code. The culprits involved
in any such act must be arrested, prosecuted and punished in
accordance with the law.

"(e) To ensure that all organs of the criminal justice system -
police, prosecutors, district magistrates, judges, medico-legal
personnel - be made aware and be expected to have full knowledge of
legislation on domestic violence and honour killings.

"(f) To ensure that all senior officials in the civil
administration and in the police department at the provincial and
district levels take special notice of all reports of honour
killings and that all cases are properly and thoroughly
investigated and the perpetrators brought to trial. The government
should establish an independent body to monitor handling by the
police of honour killing cases as well as cases of violence against
women and the treatment of women who have been victims of violence.

"(g) To ensure that the ever increasing incidence of all sorts of
violence, including domestic violence, against women are checked
and contained in an effective manner and the culprits in all cases
are arrested promptly and punished expeditiously in accordance with
the laws."

It is now up to the 212 women legislators of the five assemblies
and the 17 of the Senate, (a formidable force indeed) to do their
utmost to see that human rights in this country, as guaranteed by
the Constitution, are respected and upheld, and in particular that
the plight of women is relieved, that they are afforded empowerment
through education, that laws are made and enforced to eliminate the
endemic violence to which they too often are subjected.

One of our legislators, MNA Sherry Rahman, has produced a paper on
'Policy Recommendations for Women's Status in Pakistan - A
Parliamentary Charter for 2003' which gives comprehensive coverage
to all that needs to and must be done to usher the women of
Pakistan into the 21st century, free them from discrimination, and
allow them to play their due role in the progress of this country.
Presumably, this paper has been circulated to all our women
graduate parliamentarians.

As a document found in Iqbal Haider's archives indicate, there are
some 70 organizations in the country pushing the rights of women.
What do we say to you:

"Women of Pakistan unite. You have nothing to lose but your
chains". And do what you have to do while the general is batting.
He is on your side.

<a name="voic">France's voice of reason</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Eric S. Margolis

Watching American TV can be a surreal experience. Sandwiched
between ads for instant weight loss products, predigested fast
food, and incontinence panties, cable TV commentators bay like
rabid dogs for war against Iraq, and subject nations daring to
oppose President Bush's crusade to venomous abuse or sneering
disdain.

France, which speaks with the strongest, most logical voice of
those opposing war, has become the special target of vituperation
and hatred in America's leading pro-Israel media - Fox TV, the Wall
Street Journal, New York Post - and the Bush administration's bete
noire. Particularly so, now that France, Germany, and Russia vow to
veto US attempts to ram a war-enabling resolution through the UN
Security Council.

France, many Americans claim, should do whatever Washington orders
out of gratitude for US 'saving' it in two world wars. US TV
features angry veterans standing in American military cemeteries in
Normandy, denouncing France for "stabbing America in the back" - as
if invading Iraq to grab its oil and crushing Israel's enemies had
anything to do with World War II.

Few flag-waving pundits mention America sat out almost 40 per cent
of WWII until attacked by Japan. In 1940, the German armed forces
were the equivalent of the US armed forces today - a full military
generation ahead of other nations. France's entire army was
destroyed in battle by the invincible Germans; had the US fought
Germany in 1940, it too would have been routed. The Soviet Union,
not the US, defeated Germany, destroying over 100 Nazi divisions.

So enough with all the bombast about Word War II. In the eyes of
Europeans and most of the world, George Bush's administration looks
dangerously aggressive, dominated as it is by petrohawks and neo-
conservative ideologues linked to Israel's far right. These little
Mussolinis have no time for diplomacy or multi-nationalism. No
wonder a recent Pew Research poll found that formerly favourable
ratings of the US have plummeted in 19 out of 27 nations surveyed.

It seems at times that President Bush is even more eager to bomb
Paris than Baghdad. In fact, the administration has been treating
France like an enemy, rather than America's oldest ally and
intimate friend. Neo-conservatives even accuse France of anti-
Semitism, a disgusting slander.

Far from being an enemy, France has been doing what a true good
friend should do: telling Washington its policy is wrong and
dangerous, unlike the handkissing leaders of Britain, Spain and
Italy, who crave Bush's political support, or the East European
coalition of the shilling, ex-communist politicians pandering to
Washington for cash. Seventy per cent of British, and 90 per cent
of Italians and Spaniards oppose Bush's crusade.

France's President Jacques Chirac speaks for an overwhelming
majority of Europeans and, indeed, the world's people, in urging
the US to opt for diplomacy and UN inspections over a war that will
not be worth the loss of a single American soldier, not to mention
tens of thousands of Iraqis and chaos across Mesopotamia. So, too,
warns the great and wise Pope, John Paul II.

The contrast between France's reasoned diplomatic response and
Bush's belligerent behaviour could not be more stark. As is the
dignified, logical tone set by President Chirac and Foreign
Minister Dominique de Villepin compared to the bullying, low-brow,
locker-room talk issuing from the White House that has seriously
damaged America's reputation and image around the globe.

This week Turkey's new parliament, chosen in the first truly
democratic election in memory, followed Europe, courageously
rejecting Washington's bribes and demands US ground forces be
allowed to attack Iraq from Turkish territory. Washington's
churlish response - withdrawing its bribes, threatening punishment
- contrasted curiously to Bush's claims his goal in Iraq is
bringing democracy to the Mideast.

Democracy, its seems, is fine so long as it does US bidding.
Inconveniently, Turkey's people and democratic government voted a
resounding no to war. Pakistan would do well to follow Turkey's
brave example, particularly in rejecting any UN vote on war. But
how long the Turks can resist intense pressure from the US and its
friends, Turkey's hard right generals, remains to be seen.

Bush's crusade against Iraq will go on with or without Turkey. The
war will be akin to throwing a grenade into a huge hornet's nest.
France, which lives next to the Arab world and has five million
Muslim citizens, warns an invasion and occupation of Iraq will roil
the entire region, spark more terrorism, and hit Europe with a
dangerous backblast. But Bush couldn't care less, as he would say.

While Bush prepares war against demolished Iraq, he is ducking the
surging nuclear confrontation with North Korea, which, unlike Iraq,
truly threatens North America. His outrageous dereliction of duty
over Korea, obsessive war-mongering against Iraq, crude, aggressive
behaviour worthy of Leonid Brezhnev's Soviet Union, threats against
the UN, $400 billion deficit that will infect the world with
inflation, and damage to America's reputation - such are Bush's
'accomplishments' to date. Who needs enemies with world-class
blunderers like this in charge?America's friends and neighbours,
led by France, the mother of diplomacy, rightly warn the steroidal
Bush administration to halt its rush to war. President Chirac and
Foreign Minister de Villepin deserve the Nobel Peace Prize.
Americans owe France an apology, and a hearty 'merci.'- Copyright

<a name="unvo">UN vote and other things</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ayaz Amir

For once, thank God, Gen Musharraf and his team have got it right
on a crucial issue. After PM Jamali's declaration in the National
Assembly and later over the airwaves, it is fairly certain that
Pakistan will not vote for any war resolution on Iraq.

When push comes to shove Pakistan will probably abstain. Which is
not as good as saying 'no' to the unholy scheme afoot to rain death
and destruction on Iraq. But, in the spirit of being grateful for
small mercies, infinitely better than leaping once again into
America's lap and covering the national banner, tattered as it
already is, with a fresh coat of infamy.

The only thing left to hope, and pray, for is that from its present
pedestal of resolve neither pressure nor blandishments should make
Pakistan slip. About blandishments we can be fairly sure little
will come our way, our American friends considering us fair game
for arm-twisting. Cameroon, Guinea and Angola - -also of the family
of the so-called undecided -- may get a few carrots. But for the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan only the good old stick.

The fact that we allow ourselves to be taken for granted makes it
all the more likely that our American friends will be livid with
us. Of all countries how dare we break lose from their ranks?
Powell is working the telephones and between now and crunch time is
sure to call his good friend Gen Musharraf again. Let us throw up a
collective prayer that Pakistan's defenders don't crack under the
strain. They have cracked so often before as to have made a bad
habit of it. Let's hope it remains different this time.

Britain, America's ever-faithful poodle, has come up with a set of
absurd conditions for Saddam to fulfil in order to avert war. More
likely to save Tony Blair's skin. The simmering ferment in Labour
ranks makes it clear that going to war without UN backing will be
the end of the road for him. At the same time, he has gone so far
out on a limb that not going to war now will finish what remains of
his leadership. And then the knives - but let's not jump to
conclusions.

Let us simply look at how his government panicked when the US
Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggested that if for some reason
(a reference to Blair's domestic troubles) Britain was not on
board, America would have to do the fighting alone. The thought of
being left out sent shock waves through Whitehall. Britain's
predicament is comic. It is behaving like a poodle and a vulture at
the same time, deferential poodleism going hand in hand with a
salivating desire to be in on the kill.

There's no reason for Pakistan to show all its cards prematurely.
It should wait for this latest British absurdity to play itself
out. No point in making stentorian declarations either which will
only get the Americans to come at us like a load of bricks. Even
so, between now and voting time in the Security Council, in all the
mosques and imambargahs of the Republic let us remember the prayer
about our military defenders not cracking under the strain.

Should we not then be grateful for even the partial democracy we
have? Left to themselves, what would our defenders have done? Call
professional politicians what you will but for all their faults, at
times huge, they are more sensitive to public opinion than
defenders on horseback.

Most of the adventurism filling the annals of our foreign policy
has come from military sources. Politicians have been more
cautious. They have been wrong about many things and by their
behaviour have often been their own worst enemies. But wars and
needless foreign entanglements they have largely avoided. In the
stormy days ahead, Pakistan's defenders should be listening hard to
whatever outside advice they can get.

But will the ISI ever learn? For the first time in the
directorate's history it invited foreign correspondents into its
lair in order to show them a video of how the alleged Al Qaeda
operative, Khalid Shaikh Muhammad, was arrested. Why? I have not
the foggiest. In the event, no one believed them, the video looking
too obviously doctored.

If some press reports are to be believed, the ISI was also dining
(sorry, no wining) Q League Senators on the eve of the Senate's
maiden session during which the newly-elected Senators were to take
oath and elect their chairman and deputy chairman.

Granted that the Q League's true godfathers reside in ISI
headquarters. Still, there is such a thing as subtlety. The
election of the chairman and deputy chairman (from the ruling
party, where else) was a foregone conclusion. The ISI need not have
taken the dining pains that it apparently did. The ISI has many
qualities. When can it add subtlety to the list? And when can the
nation expect the ISI to stop playing its political games?

Which brings me to my friend Rana Sanaullah, PML-N MPA from
Faisalabad. Picked up from outside his lawyer's chamber in
Faisalabad by plainclothesmen and beaten up once again. He was
first roughed up in police or military custody soon after the
Musharraf takeover. His sin: saying a few harsh things about the
army at a meeting of PML-N MPAs at the Lahore residence of Pervez
Elahi.

He didn't quite learn his lesson, for after being re-elected (we
were colleagues in 1997) he said some more harsh things about the
army in the Punjab assembly. Obviously, a tough nut. For his pains,
he's been beaten up again and his body lacerated with small cuts to
the skin. An attempt was also made to humiliate him, his hair,
moustache and eyebrows having being shaved. What is to be said?
This is barbarism, and crude at that, pure and simple. As a nation
it doesn't show us in too flattering a light. And then we complain
about our bad image.

The Legal Framework Order, which enshrines Gen Musharraf's attempt
to rewrite the Constitution in his own image, is not helping our
collective image either. The National Assembly is not swallowing it
and unless it does so (with a two-thirds majority, no less) it will
not be the kind of legal tender, or call it indemnification for
unconstitutional acts, which strongmen so strongly desire in their
search for security and legitimacy.

Signs are that the opposition parties, knowing they have Gen
Musharraf on a hook, won't relent unless they succeed in getting
the general to take off his uniform. Or at least announce a date
for doing so. Musharraf is no fool, however. He knows that the day
he sheds his uniform he'll be more naked than the emperor without
his clothes.

Does this have the makings of a classic standoff? Much will depend
on the religious parties. It's hard to be sure where they stand at
all times because some of them have a history of close ties to the
army and ISI. They also must protect their stakes in the Frontier
and Balochistan. This is the first time Pakistan's maulvis are
tasting the halwa of power. They won't give it up lightly.

The PPP reads the wind in its own fashion. After the elections it
wasn't averse to a deal with the military provided the terms were
right. The PML-N, forced by circumstances to be consistent, is
ploughing a lonely field. But the point is that while all three
entities have their differences, on the question of the LFO they
stand together. Or at least are together till now. Given that
consistency and steadiness of purpose are not highly-prized virtues
in the shifting sands of Pakistani politics, what happens tomorrow
is hard to say.

Spare a thought, however, for Musharraf's problem. He must sink or
swim with the present set-up, which after all is his creation. It's
a phenomenon oft-seen in Pakistan than when an artificial structure
such as the one we have at present collapses for whatever reason,
its inventor is hard put to survive the after-shocks.

<a name="deci">Decision on Wasim delayed</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, March 13: The decision on Wasim Akram's request seeks
waiving off the penalties imposed by one-man judicial commission on
him has been delayed. It was learnt that the delay was on technical
grounds.

The PCB General Manager Cricket Operations Zakir Khan, is to hear
the identical requests of Wasim and ex-Test pacer Ata-ur-Rehman,
who was given a life ban.

Justice Malik Qayyum had imposed a fine of Rs 300,000 besides
recommending that the all-rounder not be made captain of Pakistan.

Zakir has written a letter to the International Cricket Council
(ICC) to inquire if its Anti Corruption Unit had any objection
against Wasim or not in this connection. ICC has replied to the PCB
that at the moment it could not pass on such inquiries in this
regard because they were busy in the World Cup.

Wasim will be called by Zakir after getting a reply from the ICC
which is not likely to be received in the next 15 days. In case,
Wasim's hopes of being named captain again are dimmed.

<a name="waqa">Waqar and Inzamam likely to face axe</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, March 12: The Pakistan team for the April 1-10 Sharjah Cup
will be picked after the selectors watch the remaining matches of
the ongoing NBP One-day Patron's Cup.

It was learnt through reliable sources that the Pakistan Cricket
Board has decided to watch the performances of all the seniors and
juniors in the one-day competition before finalising a team for the
Sharjah Cup, which also involves South Africa and Sri Lanka.

The PCB, after Pakistan's dismal performance in the World Cup, has
been passing through a difficult situation of either to consider
the seniors players for the Sharjah Cup or to build up a new look
team, under long term planning for the next World Cup in 2007.

After the World Cup's debacle, no senior player had so far
announced his retirement, which was expected and that has created a
problem for the PCB how to sideline them forthwith.

However, some seniors players including Waqar Younis and Inzamam-
ul-Haq are unlikely to find a place in the Sharjah Cup squad.

The decision of testing the seniors and juniors players in the one-
day cup has been conveyed by PCB Chairman, Lt Gen Tauqir Zia, to
the national selection committee headed by Wasim Bari and Waqar who
met him at the Gaddafi Stadium.

Furthermore, the review committee, appointed by PCB chief after the
debacle, would also have presented its report for which deadline is
March 23.

Former captain Javed Miandad is tipped to replace Richard Pybus as
Pakistan team coach. Pybus' contract was till the end of the
ongoing World Cup.

<a name="refu">Waqar refuses to step down, Inzamam quits vice-captaincy</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Correspondent

LAHORE, March 10: Beleaguered Pakistan skipper Waqar Younis refused
to quit following his side's unceremonious World Cup exit while
seeking the nation's pardon.

However, Inzamam-ul-Haq, after a wretched run with the bat during
the tournament in southern Africa, stepped down as vice-captain.

Waqar, while announcing his decision, told a crowded press
conference at Gaddafi Stadium that he will continue to play on
because he deemed himself quite fit.

The fast bowler is following in the footsteps of Pakistan Cricket
Board chairman Lt Gen Tauqir Zia and chief selector Wasim Bari who
are keen to carry on.

Waqar said, "at the moment I am not opting for retirement, but I
can't say any thing about tomorrow. I want to repair the damage
that has been done to Pakistan cricket in the World Cup by us,"
Waqar said.

Waqar refused to discuss the reasons behind team's debacle. "There
was no mystery and the case is simple we did not play to our
potential."

Waqar did not agree that his captaincy played a part in the
downfall of Pakistan side. "It is not true, but we batted and
bowled badly which led to poor results."

The 31-year-old pacer said changes in the batting order for every
match was done by the tour selection committee, which also included
the team manager Mr Shaharyar Khan.

Waqar negated the impression that the team had not learnt lessons
from the sequence of defeats that started from the Morocco Cup last
August.

"We learnt from the defeats, but could not perform in the World
Cup," he said.

Waqar agreed with manager Mr Shaharyar's point of view that holding
of the send-off ceremony before the team's departure only served to
mount further pressure on the players, who were already fighting
with the pressure of the World Cup.

Waqar admitted that the bowling let down the team in the crunch
match against India. "I dismissed two Indian batsmen in one over,
but overall, the performance of the bowlers at both ends was very
bad."

When asked why he resorted to bowl two beamers at Australian
batsman Andrew Symonds in the opening match, Waqar admitted that he
was unaware of the beamer rules and that's why umpire David
Shepherd prevented him from bowling again.

Inzamam too sounded apologetic about the team's pathetic showing
and like Waqar sought the nation's pardon. The burly batsman, who
made just 19 runs in six matches, conceded the added burden of
vice-captaincy was the reason of his poor form.

Mr Shaharyar, meanwhile, very diplomatically pointed out that the
seniors were not capable of delivering the goods.

"Top players are aging now and they can't deliver the same that
they had been producing in 90s. While the rising stars like Yousuf
Youhana, Younis Khan, Abdul Razzaq and others proved they still
lack in countering pressure of the mega event," the manager noted.

Mr Shaharyar confessed that he had no justification to defend the
regrettable performance of the team. "Neither the team faced any
injury problems nor any decision of the umpires went against them."

The former diplomat also remarked that Pakistan players were not
disciplined enough in terms of cricketing language. "We have learnt
these basics about cricket at school level which is the right
platform to polish cricketers from their teenage years."

Mr Shaharyar dispelled the impression of grouping between Wasim
Akram and Waqar. "It is totally baseless. Both Wasim and Waqar had
been addressing the team's meetings before and after every match
which shows unity between them."

He said that people had great expectations from this team. "The
public during the send-off ceremony were saying with confidence we
can win the World Cup and we will bring the cup home."

Former captain Wasim Akram was also officially called up by the PCB
to attend the press conference, but for some reasons, he failed to
show up.

<a name="shah">Shahid Afridi banned, fined for dissent</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

KARACHI, March 13: All-rounder Shahid Afridi will not be considered
for next month's Sharjah Cup by Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for
bringing the game into disrepute.

According to PCB, Shahid has been found guilty of sledging Virender
Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar as well as respected English umpire
David Shepherd during the high profile World Cup Group 'A'
encounter between Pakistan and India at Centurion (South Africa) on
March 1.

"We received an official complaint from the International Cricket
Council (ICC) supported with evidence," a PCB spokesman said on
Thursday after a two-day meeting of the board with Lt Gen Tauqir
Zia, the PCB chairman, presiding over at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.

Shahid has also been fined 50 per cent of his Indian match fee by
PCB.

"The players were told prior to their departure for South Africa
that no indiscipline will be tolerated," the spokesman said.
"Unfortunately, Shahid Afridi breached the players Code of Conduct
and had to be penalised."

However, Shahid has been allowed to represent his department, Habib
Bank, in the ongoing NBP One-day Patron's Cup.

Meanwhile, Pakistan's squad for the April 1-10 Sharjah Cup is
expected to be announced on March 24.

The national selectors will pick the 15-man team after assessing
form and fitness of the players in the Patron's Cup.

Furthermore, the PCB has not yet decided who will lead the side.
But it is almost certain now that fast bowler Waqar Younis, who led
Pakistan in the World Cup, is unlikely to be retained either as
player or captain.

JOHANNESBURG, March 8: Coach Richard Pybus said he would not be
seeking a new deal with Pakistan after the team's World Cup
failure.

He also suggested the team might need a home-grown coach to fulfil
its potential.

Pybus said in East London: "I'm not down but it was incredibly
frustrating. From a coaching point of view, I was not able to help
improve the team's performance, as I wanted to.

"Whether it was me or the players. I don't know. I didn't feel the
team had moved forward.

"My contract ran out at the end of the World Cup campaign and I'll
now take some time to think things over."

"Maybe the team needs a Pakistani coach," he said.

Pybus is preparing a report for the Pakistan Cricket Board on the
World Cup campaign.

Pybus said the team had not played good cricket "for quite some
time" but that poor form has been masked by exceptional individual
performances. -Reuters

JOHANNESBURG, March 12: Pakistan's Shoaib Akhtar and Brett Lee of
Australia have confirmed their places as the world's fastest
bowlers by sending down the quickest deliveries at the World Cup.

According to official statistics released, they are the only two
bowlers to have broken the 160kmh mark.

Shoaib's fastest delivery took the speed gun up to 161.3kmh in
Pakistan's match against England, while Lee came close to matching
his pace rival, also against England, where his top speed was
clocked at 160.7kmh.

Third fastest bowler is New Zealand's Shane Bond whose quickest
delivery of 153.4kmh was unleashed against Canada with West Indies'
Jermaine Lawson just a fraction behind.

Fastest recorded deliveries by bowlers from each country:

Australia: Brett Lee 160.7kmh v England (Port Elizabeth).

Bangladesh: Mashrafe Mortaza 139.5kmh v Canada (Durban).

Canada: Davis Joseph 140.5kmh v Bangladesh (Durban).

<a name="unhe">Unheralded Kenya score famous win to reach last four</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
BLOEMFONTEIN (South Africa), March 12: Kenya recorded a famous
seven-wicket victory over fellow-Africans Zimbabwe to become the
first non-Test nation to qualify for the World Cup semifinals.

Thomas Odoyo struck a powerful 43 off 60 balls with eight fours as
Kenya easily reached their meagre victory target of 134 from
exactly 26 overs in the Super Six match. He shared an unbeaten
partnership of 73 with Maurice Odumbe (38 not out).

Kenya, who have still to meet the unbeaten defending champions
Australia in the second round, will play India in the semifinals.
Zimbabwe were eliminated.

"Our target was the Super Six but then we reviewed our target,"
said captain Steve Tikolo.

Kenya took 10 points through to the second round after beating
Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. They were awarded four points when New
Zealand refused to play in Nairobi because of security fears.

"We just decided to go out and be positive," Odumbe added.
"Normally low scores are very tricky so we just decided if there
was a ball to hit we would hit it.

"It's a great feeling and I'm sure people back home are happy."

For Zimbabwe only Andy Flower came to terms with the slow pitch and
accurate bowling, scoring 63 as Zimbabwe were dismissed for 133 off
44.1 overs. It was their lowest total in 15 matches against Kenya,
who had never beaten them before.

Opening bowler and Man-of-the-Match Martin Suji dismissed Craig
Wishart (5), Alistair Campbell (7) and Grant Flower (7).

Leg-spinner Collins Obuya then had wicket-keeper Tatenda Taibu
caught behind for three with the fifth ball of his first over, Dion
Ebrahim stumped for 13 and captain Heath Streak caught at slip for
a duck.

Andy Blignaut was run out for four after a horrible mixup with Andy
Flower and Flower was bowled by Odoyo.

"Credit must go to Kenya, they stuck to their disciplines as they
have done all tournament," said Streak. "Unfortunately our batters
got out to some soft shots."

Campbell, who has not played for six weeks and was recruited from
the television commentary box after Mark Vermeulen fractured his
skull, looked rusty before being trapped in front by Suji.

Grant Flower became Suji's third victim when he slashed at a wide
delivery and was caught behind. Zimbabwe slumped to 66 for four in
the 21st over when Taibu edged a leg break from Collins Obuya to
Kennedy Obuya.

The same combination accounted for Ebrahim, who ventured past a
delivery and was easily stumped.

The most avoidable dismissal of the innings followed nine overs
later when Andy Flower and Blignaut sprinted towards the same end.
Kennedy Obuya dashed to the other end and ran Blignaut out for
four.

Streak had yet to score when he edged a ball from Collins Obuya to
Ravindu Shah at slip, and Zimbabwe's hopes of posting a respectable
total ended when Flower was bowled around his legs by seamer Odoyo
to make it 114 for eight in the 36th over.

Tikolo wrapped up the tail with his off-spin by having Henry Olonga
caught by a diving Odumbe at short mid-wicket for three and then
bowling Douglas Marillier for a dogged 21.

Kenya made an uncertain start to their reply when Shah was dropped
twice and survived a confident appeal for caught behind before
being run out for 14 at the non-striker's end in the eighth over.

Fast bowler Blignaut laid a hand on Kennedy Obuya's fierce drive,
and the ball hit the stumps with Shah out of his ground.

Two overs later Tikolo, on two, attempted a pull shot to a delivery
from Blignaut and skied it to Streak in the covers.

Kenya were 62 for three in the 17th over after Obuya was trapped in
front for 19 by Olonga. But any thoughts Zimbabwe had of finding a
back door back into the match were snuffed out by Odoyo and Odumbe.
Odumbe's innings lasted only 20 balls and contained eight fours. -

<a name="champ">Champions come back from dead to bury Kiwis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
PORT ELIZABETH (South Africa), March 11: Australia came back from
the dead on Tuesday to beat trans-Tasman neighbours New Zealand by
96 runs and maintain their unbeaten World Cup record.

After New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond had produced his country's
best One-day International figures of six for 23 to reduce the
world champions to 84 for seven, Michael Bevan (56) and Andy Bichel
(64) led a stirring fightback.

The pair added 97 for the eighth wicket, an Australia World Cup
record, to help their side to a final total of 208 for nine.

Glenn McGrath (three for 29) then knocked the top off the New
Zealand innings and Brett Lee returned for a second spell to remove
top-scorer Stephen Fleming (48) and a shell-shocked lower order as
New Zealand were dismissed for 112.

Lee's second spell was five for 11 in 4.1 overs, including five
wickets for three runs in 15 balls as New Zealand lost their last
five wickets for 10 runs.

Australia captain Ricky Ponting said: "We've got a lot of very,
very good players and we are a very good team. "And we back
ourselves to get out of trouble in any situation as we did today.

"Bevan and Bichel batted beautifully, then the bowling finished the
job."

The win was Australia's eighth in succession in the World Cup and
their 14th in a row in all One-day International cricket, extending
their world record run. It also confirmed they will play their
semifinal at the same venue next Tuesday.

The defeat for New Zealand means they will have to beat India in
their last Super Six match on Friday to secure a semifinal place of
their own. That requirement looked highly unlikely, at least for
much of the first half of the day, as Bond created havoc in the
Australia top order.

The former Christchurch policeman eclipsed the previous best
figures by a New Zealand player in one-day cricket, the six for 25
taken by Scott Styris against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in
2002.

"I thought I bowled pretty well and the luck came my way," Bond
said.

Bond combined pace and accuracy, starting Australia's slide with an
opening spell of three for 20 before he returned midway through the
innings with a second burst of three wickets for four runs in four
overs.

Bond, who was named Man-of-the-Match, bowled a full length and used
helpful conditions expertly after Fleming had won the toss but
Bichel and Bevan took advantage of the end of his spell to launch
the recovery.

The pair, who had steered Australia to victory over England at the
same venue nine days earlier, passed Australia's previous best
eighth-wicket stands both in World Cups and against New Zealand and
played with great common sense.

Bichel's score equalled the highest ever made by a number nine in
One-day Internationals and was his first international 50. It took
83 balls included four fours and a six from a delivery from Andre
Adams that bounced twice.

Bevan was his usual calm, unruffled self as he moved to his second
50 of the tournament in an innings that spanned 94 balls, and also
included four fours and a six.

With Lee clubbing the last two balls of the innings for six to take
the score past 200, Australia appeared to have a total to bowl at,
something was shown all too clearly when they took the field.

McGrath struck first, removing make-shift opener Daniel Vettori
(10), Nathan Astle (0) and Styris (3) in his opening burst.

Ian Harvey and Bichel then shut down the New Zealand run rate but
with Fleming still at the crease the batting side still looked to
be in reasonable shape.

Fleming was especially severe on Lee early on with the fast
bowler's first spell of five overs costing 31 runs, but when the
fast bowler returned he quickly got his revenge as the New Zealand
captain was caught down the leg-side gloving a pull shot.

With Lee finding his range, the tail were quickly blown away and
Chris Harris was left stranded on 15 not out as the innings ended
in just 30.1 overs.

"The ball was coming out well, especially in that last spell," Lee
said.

Fleming said New Zealand had ran out of momentum. "We needed a
partnership," he said. "That didn't happen, we lost wickets
continuously."

Ponting said Australia needed more runs in the top order. "We are
going to have to identify the best way to play in the first 15
overs," he said. -Reuters

<a name="indi">Indians storm into semis with record win over Sri Lanka</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
JOHANNESBURG, March 10: India stormed into the World Cup semifinals
with a 183-run win over Sri Lanka in their Super Six match at The
Wanderers.

Javagal Srinath wrecked the batting with four of the first five
wickets as Sri Lanka tumbled to 109 all out from 23 overs. It was
India's biggest win over the 1996 champions and Sri Lanka's second
lowest World Cup score.

Srinath, 33, captured two wickets in his first over and finished
with four for 35 from nine fierce and disciplined overs. Left-arm
fast bowler Ashish Nehra finished with identical figures from
seven.

Chasing India's formidable 292 for six, built on Sachin Tendulkar's
commanding 97, Sri Lanka were soon in deep trouble.

Srinath removed his first three victims for ducks, claiming Marvan
Atapattu and Jehan Mubarak in his first over before trapping in-
form Aravinda de Silva lbw to make it 15 for four in the fourth
over.

Left-armer Zaheer Khan dismissed Mahela Jayawardene lbw for a duck
and captain Sanath Jayasuriya (12) hit Srinath straight to Mohammad
Kaif at cover.

Srinath's performance followed yet another Tendulkar master class.

The Indian maestro agonisingly missed a record fifth World Cup
century but helped India amass a daunting total after Jayasuriya
put the opposition in to exploit any early life in the pitch after
overnight rain.

Tendulkar was out for 97, edging a sweep against de Silva to
jubilant wicket-keeper Kumar Sangakkara after moving past his
previous World Cup record aggregate of 523 scored at the 1996 World
Cup. He has scored 571 runs so far at the 2003 tournament at an
average of 71.38 with a strike rate of 90.3

The India opener, who was dismissed for 98 in a first round match
against Pakistan, said he was disappointed to miss a century again.

"But I'm very excited to be in the semifinals," he said. "It was a
good track to bat on and Javagnal and Ashish bowled really well. To
be able to extract so much pace and movement was something
extraordinary."

Tendulkar shared an opening partnership of 153 with Virender
Sehwag, who recorded his highest score of the tournament with 66.

Yet another left-arm pace bowler Chaminda Vaas, the tournament's
leading wicket taker, led a bowling fightback with consecutive
maidens to Tendulkar before returning to bowl captain Saurav
Ganguly (48) and Yuvraj Singh (5) in his final spell.

India's seventh consecutive victory ensured them of a semifinal
place along with defending champions Australia. Both teams have 16
points.

"I thought it was the perfect game of cricket for us," said
Ganguly. "We batted brilliantly and then bowled superbly, we have
stuck together as a team and worked hard as a team. Everybody has
fired."

Sri Lanka's semifinal hopes now depend on a Zimbabwe victory over
Kenya followed by a win themselves over the Zimbabweans.

"We didn't bowl in the right areas," said Jayasuriya. "We bowled
all over the place and there were some easy runs. -Reuters

<a name="astl">Astle, Cairns sparkle as New Zealand triumph</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
BLOEMFONTEIN, March 8: Nathan Astle and Chris Cairns combined
forces to take New Zealand to an ultimately comfortable six-wicket
victory over Zimbabwe in their World Cup Super Six match.

Astle, New Zealand's leading scorer in one-day cricket, took his
total past 5,500 with a patient unbeaten 102. Cairns, who took his
first wickets of the tournament with two for 16 from four overs,
was equally restrained with 54, including two huge sixes.

The pair added 121 for the fourth wicket to set up victory for New
Zealand with 16 balls to spare.

"It is nice to be getting the rewards for a lot of hard work,"
Cairns said. "It was nice to be back at the bowling crease."

Cairns said the New Zealanders, who took only four points through
from the first round, believed they needed two wins out of three to
qualify for the semifinals.

"We have got a big game next against the Australians and they're
playing very, very well," he said.

New Zealand were set a competitive target of 253 after Zimbabwe
captain Heath Streak and Sean Ervine produced some of the most
extraordinary late-hitting ever seen in a World Cup.

Steak rebuilt the innings patiently during a 68-run stand with
Tatenda Taibu (53) after his side had slumped to 106 for six, and
then teamed up with Ervine.

A savage assault resulted in 62 runs, almost a quarter of the
team's score, coming off the last 18 balls.

Streak, who ended on 72 not out, and Ervine, who made 31 from 14
balls, hit eight fours and three sixes in those final three overs.

Captain Stephen Fleming led from the front as New Zealand set off
in pursuit of Zimbabwe's 252 for seven. Fleming stroked 10 fours in
his 46 from 42 balls, including three in a row from Streak.

After his dismissal, Astle took responsibility for the innings,
against an attack lacking leg-spinner Brian Murphy who tore a calf
muscle practising in the break between innings.

He refused to take chances, preferring to play straight and take
the singles, a strategy which ultimately paid off handsomely.

His 13th one-day century took 122 balls, contained 11 fours and
kept New Zealand on course to reach the semifinals.

"It was a big one," said Astle, who was named Man-of-the-Match. "We
have to win today, we were probably chasing a few too many at the
end.

"Cairnsy and I got the partnership we needed and it all worked out
well. We had a couple of overs to spare."

Fleming said the game had been in the balance when Cairns joined
Astle. "It was the biggest partnership of the game and the guys did
it well," he said.

Streak said his team had been about 30 runs short. "It could have
been a much tighter game. We lost those wickets and we also lost a
couple of guys through injury," he said. -Reuters

<a name="waug">Waugh yet to decide on Test career</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
BRISBANE, March 13: Australian captain Steve Waugh said he had yet
to make a decision about his Test career ahead of the announcement
of the national team to tour the West Indies.

Waugh said he was thinking only about leading New South Wales into
Friday's five-day Interstate Shield final against Queensland at the
Gabba. But a decision must be made by Sunday because Australian
selectors will conduct a phone hook-up later that night to settle
on a 15-man squad to play in the Caribbean.

Waugh is expected to play on next month, particularly given his
repeated claims to be thoroughly enjoying his cricket.

"I haven't really thought too much about it. There's been a lot of
speculation and people keep asking me," Waugh said at a press
conference here on Thursday.

"It's funny in a way because I feel as if I don't have to make a
decision because right now I'm still playing cricket.

"I don't see it as such a big thing. Retirements are a bit
overstated and the lap of honour and everyone telling you how good
you are. People tend to make it into a bigger deal than what it
is."

"I just want to get out there and play cricket at the moment and
I'll decide when the time comes but I haven't made a decision."

Waugh's Australian teammate Glenn McGrath said from South Africa he
had no idea whether the Test captain would play on.

McGrath and wife Jane are close to Waugh and his wife Lynette.

"Jane has spoken to Lynette and they haven't given anything away,"
McGrath told Australian Associated Press.

"They've got their reasons for that. If Lynette doesn't know,
there's only one person that does know and maybe he's still trying
to work it out. That's Stephen, though."

National selector Trevor Hohns said he had received no indication
from Waugh and insisted the selection panel would not try to
influence the 37-year-old's decision.

"We're really leaving it to him," Hohns said. "We need to find out
what his intentions are."

Hohns plans to speak with Waugh during the final and he may have an
ideal chance on Friday with drizzle expected to delay the start of
the match.-AFP

<a name="sout">South African legend Donald opts to quit</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
BLOEMFONTEIN, March 8: South Africa paceman Allan Donald, the most
successful bowler in his country's history, announced his
retirement from all international cricket.

"I would like to be remembered as someone who gave his all, I was
very passionate about the badge and the country and about every
team I've played for," he told a news conference.

Donald, 36, the only bowler to take more than 300 wickets for South
Africa said he would play for two more seasons for his province
Free State.

"It's been a wonderful time," he said. "I've gone around the world,
playing against the best players. To have achieved what I have
achieved as a professional sportsman and a South African cricketer,
I am very, very proud of it.

"I can walk out of this room today and say I've done my absolute
best. I've got no regrets."

"I've played in four World Cups and we have had a bit of a tough
time of it in this World Cup," he said. "My philosophy about it is
was that it wasn't meant to be." -Reuters

<a name="huss">Hussain calls for separate England captains</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LONDON, March 9: Nasser Hussain has reiterated his desire to stay
on as Test captain despite quitting as skipper of the one-day side.

Speaking in his column in the Sunday Telegraph a weary Hussain also
said it was time that the separate captains were appointed for each
form of the game - citing the increased pressures of the job as the
chief reason.

Hussain stood down as one-day captain after rain washed out
Zimbabwe's match against Pakistan, ending any chance England had of
reaching the World Cup Super Six.

The 34-year-old admitted that the tournament, and his own form, had
been a major disappointment.

"The three main reasons I came to the difficult decision were,
firstly, that I believe a younger core of players should be
selected to take the one-day side on to the next World Cup,"
Hussain said in the report.

"Secondly, I did not warrant a place in the team any more, and
thirdly I want to preserve my enthusiasm for carrying on in Test
cricket, if possible as captain."

"The England captaincy in any form of cricket is something I have
been very proud of and not something I will give away lightly,"
added Hussain, who took over as England captain in 1999.

Hussain believes splitting the captaincy will make both jobs
easier, and allow both men to concentrate more on events on the
field of play.

"On tour you have so many questions about so many thinks apart from
yourself and England's cricket," said Hussain.

"You have to talk about injuries, opposing players, about the
International Cricket Council, the ECB, about political issues like
Zimbabwe.

"Splitting the captaincy would help me if I was asked to stay on as
Test captain and it would also help the new one-day skipper settle
into the job.

"If the whole captaincy is landed on one new individual, something
in him will have to give."

After a gruelling Ashes tour in which his captaincy was called into
question during a 4-1 series defeat, followed by the fruitless
World Cup campaign, Hussain says he is just happy to be home and
able to recharge the batteries.

"All the time we were in Australia we were looking forward to it
(the World Cup), and now none of us will look back on it fondly,"
Hussain said.

"I would like to go back to doing what I wanted to do as a boy: to
play Test cricket for England, not be a national spokesman for
everything cricketing." -Reuters/AFP

<a name="draw">Pakistan draw with India</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LAHORE, March 10: Pakistan drew against India 1-1 in the 5th
Akhbar-el-Youm hockey at Cairo Stadium to earn their second
successive similar result in the event, according to a message
received.

Pakistan had already played a 1-1 draw against Poland in their
opening match.

India dominated from the start and took a deserved lead in the 8th
minute through Gurcharan Singh. Pakistan salvaged pride when
striker Muhammad Ali struck the equaliser in the 24th minute to
keep the issue alive.

Reduced to ten men in the second half following the marching order
for Ali having shown the second yellow card, Pakistan impressed
with some lively moves and attacking game but the inexperienced
forwards missed several chances. Ali will miss the next match.-APP

<a name="asim">Asim and Nomi dropped from team
</a>-------------------------------------------------------------------
Sports Reporter

ISLAMABAD, March 9: In a major move, the Pakistan Tennis Federation
(PTF) dropped Asim Shafik and Nomi Qamar from the Davis Cup team
announced for this April's Asia Oceania Group I tie against Japan.

Replacing them will be Shahzad Samad Khan and Shahzad Khan who were
named along with Aisamul Haq and Aqeel Khan on the squad for the
April 4 to 6 tie in Toyota, Japan.

Both Asim, ranked No 2 and Nomi who is number three on the ranking
ladder, were axed for their "below par" performance in last month's
clash against New Zealand in Hamilton where Pakistan were
whitewashed 5-0.

Meanwhile a training camp in preparation for the match began at the
PTF Complex on Sunday with coach-cum-camp commandant Hameedul Haq
and Mushaf Zia imparting training to the players.

Hameed, who himself played Davis Cup for Pakistan, said that a
hectic training schedule will be followed. "Each day there will be
seven hours of training including physical exercises.

He said that Akhtar Mohiuddin, who was one of the best physical
trainers in the country had arrived to keep the boys in proper
shape.

Hameed was hopeful that the selected team would do well in Japan.
