<a name="wasi">Wasim declines to defend anti-terrorism law</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Aug 30: Senate Chairman Wasim Sajjad, an astute legal expert
himself, on Friday declined to defend the controversial laws introduced
by the Nawaz Sharif government.
   
Mr. Sajjad, who is in US for the last 15 days to speak on 50th
anniversary functions, was asked searching questions by Pakistanis living
in the Washington area at a get-together arranged by the Pakistan
Ambassador at the Embassy. "I welcome the Chairman as we were class mates
in Lahore," Mr. Riaz Khokhar introduced him.
   
After a brief "bird's eye view" of the situation in Pakistan in which Mr.
Sajjad dealt with the economic and political situation and how the Nawaz
Sharif government was tackling it, the floor was opened for questions.

When asked about the controversial anti-terrorism bill, the Senate
Chairman presented "both the viewpoints" before the audience, starting
with the criticism that it gave sweeping powers to a police which "does
not have a good reputation."
   
He said the law had made confessions obtained by the police admissible in
courts and that had generated a lot of criticism. The government, he
said, was arguing that it was not dealing with a normal situation and so
"for an abnormal situation, extra powers were needed."
   
Asked whether as a lawyer and legal expert did he believe that seven days
were enough to investigate a heinous crime and convict a person in a
court and would not the police use the seven days just to "extract"
confessions even from innocent people, Wasim Sajjad said: "You are an
intelligent person. You can draw your own conclusions."

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 1: The Supreme Court on Monday received a writ petition
challenging the federal government's decision of reducing the strength of
judges of the apex court through an executive order.
   
The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) in its writ petition under
Article 184(3), through its secretary Shamim Ahmed Bokhary prayed the
apex court to declare the government's decision as "unconstitutional,
arbitrary, whimsical and malafide." The SCBA also prayed the court to
direct the government through secretary law, justice and parliamentary
affairs to fix the number of judges after consulting the Chief Justice of
Pakistan, and chief justice of the concerned high courts.
   
The petitioner association which made "Pakistan" as respondent stated
that order of the president to reduce the number of judges in the apex
court was violative of the judicial independence which was guaranteed
inter alia under Article 2 A of 1973 Constitution. It submitted that the
executive had caused a blow to the independence of judiciary which
amounted to the denial of fundamental right of getting justice to the
citizens. The SCBA stated that order of urtailing the number of judges of
Supreme Court was contrary to the aspiration and rights of the people of
Pakistan.

<a name="nawi">NA withdraws president, PM privileges</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 1: National Assembly on Monday passed three amendment
bills withdrawing a privilege of the President and the Prime Minister to
import a duty free car and their entitlement of income-tax free salary.
   
The opposition Pakistan People's Party which did not oppose the bills
termed these as 'symbolic gestures' of the government just to pretend
austerity and called for more amendments to withdraw other privileges
available to the president and prime minister.
   
"It is hypocrisy" said Naveed Qamar who had proposed several other
amendments in the same laws for withdrawing the privilege of the
president and the prime minister to import items of personal use
including food stuff and article of furnishing their residences.
   
He pointed out that even the close relatives of the president and the
prime minister were entitled to import the items of personal use. He said
there was no limit on it. Instead of just pretending they should adopt
real austerity measures, he said. "Prime minister still goes to Lahore
twice a day on a chopper," he said. "Prime minister still travels in
large entourage with cavalcade of officials limousines," he said
reminding the treasury benches their claims to do away with the VIP
culture.
   
Waja Karim Dad of the PPP said that the members had been stripped off
their privilege to use the VIP lounges at the airports while other
officials were still enjoying all the perks. He claimed that one day
expenditure of the prime minister house was Rs. 3.5 million.

<a name="prov">Poverty Alleviation Fund Co registered</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------

ISLAMABAD, Sept 2: The Planning Commission has got registered the
Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund Company (PPAFC) as a private limited
company under Sec 42 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, to tackle the
problem through the provision of microcredit to the poor, an official
source told Dawn Tuesday.
   
It will be a non-profit organization with a board of directors at its
apex and comprising three nominees of the Government and nine members
from the private sector. For the present, the deputy chairman of the
Commission, Dr Hafiz A. Pasha is chairman of BoD. Other two officials are
the Finance Secretary, Moin  Afzal and Secretary, Economic Affairs
Division, Javed Burki.
   
Nine non-official members of the BoD are well-known leaders of NGO
movement, namely: M/S Abdul Sattar Edhi, Dr Ayesha Ghous, Dr Mohammad
Tehseen, Dr Zulfikar Jilani, Zubaida Jalal, Suleman Sheikh and Humayun
Murad.
   
The immediate bases of the project are Prime Minister's announcements and
Finance Minister's budget speech in which the Government pledged to stem
the tide of poverty through various measures including, inter alia, the
establishment of village and district support organizations and provision
of micro credit for the poor, promotion of collective savings etc.
  
He had admitted in his budget speech that the percentage of those under
the poverty line had increased in the last ten years from 20 to 25%. The
idea for PPAFC is basically derived from the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh
which has successfully helped reduce population growth rate by providing
microcredit and establish microenterprises in that country. But the main
difference here is that Bangladesh is free of the feudal yoke, while
Pakistan still groans under it, observed a veteran development economist
who did not want to be identified.

<a name="fore">Foreign scholarships being slashed</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Sept 2: The Federal Government has decided to slash the Merit
Scholarship Scheme and to provide funds only for 47 people who are
already studying abroad, according to an official source.
   
The eighth five-year plan had set aside Rs 1.4 billion for scholarships,
out of which an expenditure of Rs 700 million was meant for the Federal
scholarship scheme. Even in the Annual Development Plan, an expenditure
of Rs 20 million was envisaged.
   
According to a revised plan to be considered by the Central Development
Working Party (CDWP), however, the provision has been reduced to a mere
Rs 2.3 million to be consumed over the period 1995-99, i.e. for the
duration of the training course of the individuals already studying
abroad.
   
The objective of the scheme was to make Pakistan self-sufficient in terms
of highly qualified professionals with a view to reducing dependence on
foreign experts.
   
A total of 308 people benefited from the scheme. Out of these, 164
scholars completed Ph.D, and 40 others did M.Sc. Twelve of the
beneficiaries failed to acquire any degree at all.
   
Out of those who completed their course, 14 did not return to Pakistan at
all.

<a name="soft">Software engineers aboard to be lured back</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Our Correspondent
   
ISLAMABAD, Sept 4: The federal government is planning to launch an
ambitious programme to offer employment to the Pakistani software
engineers working abroad.
   
Source said the Information Technology Commission would announce the
programme toward the end of this month.
   
Talking to Dawn, the ITC Chairman, former Senator, Syed Mazhar Ali said
the commission intends to revamp the country's information
technology-related institutions which are presently producing 4000-5000
software engineers, a year.
   
"In India, they produce more than 50,000 such experts every year, and if
we produce them at the present rate, Pakistan would be tragically
deficient in the fields of database development, education and marketing
etc", he said.
   
For this purpose, he added, the relevant institutions presently doing the
systems analyses and other works, would be upgraded to the required
level, with the help of Pakistani software engineers working abroad, to
enable them to be capable of producing better and more exportable
software producers.
   
"These Pakistanis abroad need to be offered better salaries to attract
them homeward, and the government is already working on a programme to
acquire means and resources to allocate the required funds for this
purpose".
