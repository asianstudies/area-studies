<a name="usba">US bars 380 Pakistani, Indian firms from trading</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent
    
WASHINGTON, Nov 13: The US on Friday released a list of over 140 
Pakistani and 240 Indian companies blacklisted by the Commerce 
Department for all trade and business activities with US companies.
    
A senior State Department official told a special briefing for 
South Asian journalists that the lists include government agencies 
and their sub-entities.
    
"It is not a black list or a hit list but a list published to keep 
transparency and to enable US business to carry out other business 
without interruption," the State Department official said.
    
The list has been compiled after a very thorough and the best 
available assessment and if any company disputes our finding, we 
will be prepared to review it, the official said.
    
"There was no choice for us but we had to implement the US law," 
the official said answering questions.
    
He said the publication of the list would not have any adverse 
impact on the on-going talks between the US, Pakistani and Indian 
officials.
    
The official also spoke at length about the Pakistani-IMF talks on 
a bailout package and said Islamabad will have to agree on a 
"credible reform programme" with the IMG before the US could 
implement the decision to lift the sanctions, announced by the 
President recently.
    
"The decision to provide a package of multi-lateral loans is just a 
one time affair and will only apply to the package being discussed 
between the IMF and Pakistan these days," the official said.
    
Asked what would happen if the waiver, which is valid for only nine 
months was not renewed next year and what would happen to the loans 
provided under this waiver, the official said :"We would implement 
these decisions in a very meaningful way."
    
He again dismissed Indian objections that US had discriminated 
against India and favoured Pakistan. "The decision was to stop 
Pakistan from an economic collapse and this is also in the interest 
of India," he said.
    
NEW SANCTIONS: The Commerce Department announced on Friday details 
of the Dual-use Export Control Sanctions imposed on India and 
Pakistan under the Glenn Amendment, as officials of the State 
Department tried to play down the negative impact of the new 
sanctions.
    
A prohibition is imposed on exports and reexports to certain 
government, parastatal, and private entities in India and Pakistan 
determined to be involved in nuclear or missile activities, the 
announcement said.
    
It said the complete list would be released on Nov 19. These 
entities are ineligible to receive exports or reexports of items 
subject to the ban without a license.

<a name="paki">Pakistan's assurance to US experts: No nuclear technology exports</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar
    
ISLAMABAD, Nov 12: US nuclear experts two-day meeting with their 
Pakistani counterparts concluded here on Thursday and Pakistan 
expressed its commitment not to export sensitive materials and 
technologies to third countries.
    
An expected news briefing at the end of the talks here was later 
cancelled instead a brief press release was issued by the Foreign 
Office which stated that the US team offered assistance in training 
customs and export control areas.
    
The US team led by John Baker, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of 
State, had held similar meeting with the Indian Officials concerned 
earlier this week in New Delhi.
    
The US administration has been holding serious talks with the 
governments of India and Pakistan separately since middle of the 
current year at various levels including the top level. Both the 
sub-continental States are seemingly under severe political and 
economic pressures from Washington to formally adhere to all 
aspects of a UN global nuclear regime.
    
The Foreign Office press release stated: The members of the US team 
gave detailed briefings on the US export control systems especially 
relating to sensitive and dual purpose materials and technologies 
and their experience of enforcing these controls.
    
"The Pakistani team also provided briefings regarding Pakistan's 
export control policies and customs procedures. The US side offered 
assistance in training in customs and export control areas. 
Pakistan remains committed not to export sensitive materials and 
technologies to third countries and on this score its record is 
impeccable".
    
The US team comprised officials of the State Department, the Arms 
Control and Disarmament Agency, the Department of defence and Joint 
Chiefs of Staff.
    
The Pakistan side included officials of the Foreign ministry, 
commerce ministry and the ministry of defence, defence production 
the General Headquarters, the CBR and the Pakistan Atomic Energy 
Commission.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is scheduled to visit White House in 
the first week of December in response to President Bill Clinton's 
invitation for talks in which the nuclear issue and economic 
sanctions against Islamabad are going to be the main topics. 
Regional security situation with particular reference to the 
current India-Pakistan secretaries talks on wide range of agenda 
including Kashmir and peace and security are also to come up under 
discussion between the two leaders.

<a name="vote">Pakistan votes against UN resolution on N-tests</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

UNITED NATIONS, Nov 13: India and Pakistan voted against a 
resolution, adopted by a United Nations General Assembly committee 
on Thursday, which strong-ly deplored their nuclear tests in May.
    
The short resolution, adopted by the UN committee responsible for 
disarmament with 98 votes in favour and six delegates against, was 
put forward by Australia, Canada and New Zealand.
    
The six states voting against were Benin, Bhutan, India, Pakistan, 
Zambia and Zimbabwe.
    
A total 31 delegates from mainly non-aligned states abstained in 
the vote which is due to be endorsed by the 185-nation General 
Assembly next month.
    
All five nuclear powers voted in favour of the resolution which 
"expresses grave concern over, and strongly deplores the recent 
nuclear tests conducted in South Asia."
    
It also notes that "the states concerned have said they are willing 
to enter into legal commitments not to conduct any further nuclear 
test."
    
The text also reiterates the need for "such legal commitments to be 
expressed in legal form by signing and ratifying the Comprehensive 
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty."
    
The text refrains from naming India and Pakistan, and uses weaker 
language that a UN Security Council resolution adopted on June 6 
following the tit-for-tat nuclear tests.
    
The five nuclear powers  Britain, France, China, Russia and the 
United States  fought off a series of killer amendments which 
notably called for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons 
within a specific timeframe.AFP

<a name="japa">Japan has realized Pakistan position: PM</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

MIANWALI, DAUDKHEL, Nov 11: Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif 
said here on Wednesday, Japan perhaps had realized the situation, 
under which Pakistan had to test its nuclear devices in response to 
Indian nuclear explosions last May.
    
He was responding to questions by reporters who wanted to have his 
reaction on reports that Japan had also decided to lift economic 
sanctions on Pakistan.
    
US has already decided to ease some of the economic sanctions 
slapped on Pakistan following its tit-for-tat response last May to 
Indian nuclear tests.
    
Nawaz Sharif said: "It was Japan's compulsion to slap economic 
sanctions," on Pakistan and the latter fully understood Japan's 
feelings on the nuclear subject.
    
Expressing his high regard for Japan, he said, Japan had sent a 
special envoy to Pakistan last May who had a meeting with him to 
convey his country's concern on nuclear proliferation.
    
He said Japan had been extending investment facilities to Pakistan 
also.
    
Japan news agency Jiji quoted Japan's Foreign Ministry official on 
Tuesday that Japan had also decided to remove sanctions on 
Pakistan. The formal announcement is expected to be made on eve of 
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz visit to Japan.APP

<a name="gove">Governor dissatisfied with pace of improvement</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter
    
KARACHI, Nov 12: Sindh Governor Moinuddin Haider has expressed 
dissatisfaction over the pace of improvement in the law and order 
situation in the city.
    
He regretted that despite all efforts, the main characters involved 
in the murder of Hakim Said had not been nabbed. Every time the 
hideouts of Naushad and Zulfiqar Haider were raided, they managed 
to escape.
    
However, he expressed the hope that with the changes he had 
initiated in the administration the situation would improve soon.
    
Briefing newsmen at the Governor's House on Thursday, Moinuddin 
Haider said: "We have yet to start work. And during the last week I 
have held meetings with officials of the administration, law 
enforcement personnel and civic agencies. I have given them my 
piece of advice about the expectations of people in the changed 
circumstances. I also have made it clear that any official failing 
to discharge his obligation would have no place in the set-up and 
those delivering the goods would be rewarded."
    
Brimming with confidence, the governor did not agree with a 
questioner that most of the arrests were being made of persons 
belonging to a particular group. "Within a few days the impression, 
if any, will be removed as the operation is being carried out even-
handedly."
    
He denied violation of human rights saying that for the last many 
years wrongs had been committed in the name of protest strikes, 
closing of business, schools and keeping people awake the whole 
night by firing.

<a name="expe">Pakistan expecting $500m shortly from IMF: Dar</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Nov 12: The visiting seven-member IMF mission led by Ms 
Sena Eken here on Thursday again held a marathon meeting with 
minister for finance and commerce Ishaq Dar to provide $500 million 
out of the proposed $5 billion bailout package.
    
"We are shortly expecting a $500 million tranche out of the stalled 
ESAF/EFF being revived now", said the minister for commerce.
    
He told reporters after the press conference on IPPs that the 
government wanted to conclude an understanding with the IMF mission 
as early as possible so that they could go back, prepare their 
report and circulate it to their executive board.
    
"I can not give you an interim progress because we are having a 
continued dialogue", he said.
    
However, Ishaq Dar pointed out that if every thing "goes according 
to the schedule and according to our speed, then a board meeting of 
the IMF could take place in the middle of December to approve 
certain agreement".
    
Responding to a question he pointed out that Pakistan did not 
require any devaluation under these circumstances and, "we will 
make sure that devaluation does not take place".
    
Asked whether the government has sufficient foreign exchange 
reserves for the interim period, the minister for finance and 
commerce said that the government had reached an understanding with 
the IMF in October in Washington on many issues including these 
reserves. But he did not elaborate what kind of an understanding 
had reached there.
    
"There is no extra loading of the tranche", he remarked when asked 
whether the IMF would go beyond the ESAF/EFF. He said the IMF 
assistance was likely to be the same but Paris and London Clubs 
would offer their increased assistance to have $5 billion package 
that also included $3 billion debt rescheduling.
    
"But the prerequisite on order of sequence is the programme with 
the IMF that will lay the basis to acquire funds from the Paris and 
London clubs", he said.
    
Ishaq Dar told a reporter that Pakistan could only get $250 million 
from Kuwait.
    
Asked whether Pakistan could default in case the agreement with the 
IMF delayed he said, " Pakistan can cover its core commitments". 
"We will try that we do not fall back on our commitments", he 
further stated.
    
To a question he said that $ 1.6 billion financing by the Islamic 
Development Bank (IDB) has not so far been materialised as it 
required some issues still to be sorted out.
    
He said that issues related to budgetary programmes, IPPs, GST etc. 
were being discussed with the IMF mission. "Talks are focusing on 
our home grown package and not the one given by any international 
agency", he claimed adding that the government was holding separate 
talks with the officials of the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian 
Development Bank (ADB) on different issues.

<a name="indi">India-Pakistan end 2nd round of talks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

NEW DELHI, Nov 13: India and Pakistan wrapped up on Friday seven 
days of talks which highlighted the bitter divide between the 
world's newest nuclear states and the imposing obstacles to 
compromise.
    
The final session was devoted to promoting "friendly exchanges".
    
No significant progress was made on any of the seven issues 
discussed in New Delhi, the second round of bilateral talks since 
India and Pakistan resumed their bilateral dialogue in Islamabad 
last month after a one-year freeze.
    
"The hopes with which we came here have not been fulfilled, but 
this is only an exploratory round," Pakistan government spokesman 
Tariq Altaf said after Friday's session ended.
    
The Indian side at the discussions was led by R.V.V. Ayyar, culture 
secretary in the ministry of human resources development and the 
Pakistani side by Roshan Zamir, secretary in the Islamabad 
department of culture.
    
The discussions, which began on November 5, also covered the Tulbul 
navigation project, the skirmishes at the Siachen glacier, the Sir 
Creek maritime dispute, trade and economic ties and terrorism and 
drug trafficking.
    
During the talks both the countries fine-tuned contentious 
arrangements for running the first trans-border bus service.
    
Officials said the bus service was one of the few areas where a 
"convergence of views" emerged during week-long bilateral talks.

<a name="haki">Hakim Said was killed to crush MQM, says Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

SUKKUR, Nov 11: The Chairperson of Pakistan Peoples Party, Benazir 
Bhutto, has claimed that the people responsible for the imposition 
of martial law repeatedly had masterminded the murder of Hakim 
Mohammad Said this time with an aim to crush the Muttahida Qaumi 
Movement.
    
Addressing a press conference at Nawabshah Press Club on Wednesday, 
she condemned the release of 2,000 'terrorists' from various 
prisons recently and said Nawaz Sharif had betrayed the 
Constitution. She demanded prosecution of all these criminals.
    
She said that Muttahida Qaumi Movement was not a terrorist 
organisation but it kept a terrorist wing in its fold.
    
Ms Bhutto recalled the assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan, execution 
of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and murder of Mir Murtaza Bhutto and said 
that the enemies of democracy always tried to prevent the people 
from ruling over the country and hatched conspiracies to remove the 
democratically elected governments.
    
She lashed out at the government for the retrenchment of workers 
from various organizations on a massive scale and said the anti-
people policies of the government had turned the life of common man 
miserable.
    
She also criticized the Ehtesab process and claimed that motive for 
such accountability practice was to victimize the PPP.
    
Rejecting the 'one-way' Ehtesab, she questioned: 'Why action is not 
being taken against those who have received 14 billion rupees in 
the name of Qazi Brothers on a forged passport?'
    
Ms Bhutto lamented that her party leader, Pir Mazharul Haq had been 
punished for allotting one plot while Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 
has escaped any action despite having allotted hundreds of plots.
    
She said that the PPP's move to provide jobs to unemployed people 
in PIA had been labelled as illegal but Mr Sharif's orders to 
appoint a lot of people in Habib Bank and pay Rs1.6 million per 
month to certain employee were being ignored.
    
She claimed that the PPP was ousted for its policies aimed at 
stabilizing the country's economy, foiling the Jinnahpur plot and 
containing terrorism.
    
Criticizing the PML government's foreign policy, she said Pakistan 
had been isolated and even neighbouring friendly countries, like 
Iran, were not having good relations with Islamabad.
    
Ms Bhutto termed the imposition of governor's rule on Sindh as 
'drama' and claimed that Nawaz Sharif was contemplating approval 
for the controversial Kalabagh dam by a dummy assembly.

<a name="assu">Assurance to NWFP: Power profits will be adjusted against loans</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

PESHAWAR Nov 11: The federal government has agreed with a 
provincial government's proposal to provide guarantees of continued 
payments from hydel net profits income even after the privatization 
of WAPDA well informed sources said.
    
According to sources, the federal government has also signalled in 
the positive to a provincial proposal for the adjustment of its 
arrears against federal loan amount.
    
Presently, the provincial government owes Rs33 billion to the 
federal government in loans while it has a claim of about Rs18 
billion from net profits income of hydel power which has not been 
paid to it since 1973 as constitutional obligation. The provincial 
government which has to pay around Rs400 million in the debt 
servicing on the federal loans will be alleviated from a big burden 
if the arrears amount from net profits is adjusted against the 
federal loans amount.
    
It may be mentioned that WAPDA is responsible for making payments 
to the province from net profits accounts in accordance with 
A.G.N.Kazi formula which it did till the year 1997 at a lump sum 
rate of six billion per annum against the provincial projections of 
over 9.5 billion rupees. The reason for the down payment has been 
lack of conciliation of WAPDA accounts which the authority has been 
denying on the one pretext or the other.
    
The federal government which has been assuring full payments from 
provincial arrears is already paying the quarterly instalments 
being guarantor as WAPDA has not been able to do so due to its bad 
finances and it has asked the federal government to resume the 
earlier practice of deduction at source of its bills from the 
provinces.

<a name="ctbt">CTBT signing not to affect N-plan: Qadeer</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

RAWALPINDI, Nov 11: The chairman of Khan Research Laboratories, 
Kahuta, Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, said on Wednesday that signing of the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would not affect Pakistan's nuclear 
and missile programmes.
    
Speaking at a function organized by the State Life Insurance 
Corporation at a local hotel, Dr Khan said that after nuclear 
detonations, Pakistan had acquired the ability to defend itself.
    
He said he and his team of scientists and engineers had suggested 
to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif that he should sign the CTBT if big 
powers agreed to lift sanctions imposed on Pakistan.
    
"However, we have thoroughly studied the treaty and told the prime 
minister that there is no harm in signing the CTBT, if it is 
necessary for ridding the country of economic crisis," he added.
    
Dr Khan said that even if Pakistan signed the treaty, the nuclear 
programme of the country would continue at the same pace; there 
would be no inspection of the country's nuclear installations; no 
restriction would be imposed on cold tests and no reduction would 
be made in nuclear resources of the country. Pakistan would be 
restrained from carrying out further nuclear tests, and that would 
be the only restriction under the treaty, he added.
    
Dr Khan agreed that Pakistan could not test a hydrogen bomb after 
signing the CTBT, and said: "We do not want to join a nuclear race 
and a developing country like Pakistan cannot afford to spend a 
heavy amount on making a hydrogen bomb." However, he claimed:" We 
have the ability to make a hydrogen bomb."
    
Dr Khan said Pakistan had no need for further nuclear detonations 
as the recently conducted tests had already demonstrated to the 
world the country's nuclear capability.
    
He expressed gratitude to Almighty Allah for making Pakistan a 
nuclear power, and said the entire world was astonished because a 
country, which could not make even a ball bearing, bicycle chain 
and a needle,had become a nuclear power.
    
"We have missiles which can hit enemy targets within a range of 
1500 kilometres. These missiles can carry heavy warheads," he 
added.
  
He also stressed the need for a strong economy to bring Pakistan at 
par with the developed countries.
    
He urged the people to adopt the tendency of saving and sustainable 
use of resources for agriculture and economic development.

three white tail Boeing 747s and Boeing 777s, the latest in the 
aircraft series.
    
The delay in signing off the deal immediately was due to many 
factors, including the financial arrangements and the negotiations 
for a better package on the whole deal.
    
While no commitment was inked during the PIA chairman, Shahid 
Khaqan Abbasi's recent visit to Seattle, he told Dawn on Thursday 
that "we are getting a great deal on these white tail Boeing-747-
400 series but we are negotiating to get the best deal for PIA."
    
However, Abbasi indicated that the deal to acquire at least four 
Boeing could be signed in December during Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif's visit to Washington if not earlier. "We will get two of 
these Boeings immediately".

The white tail aircraft  which mean that they were built for other 
airlines. But the Boeing company backed off on a deal with 
Philippine Airlines. Asked what he meant by "great deal" and 
discount prices on the Boeing purchase, Abbasi said: "I cannot 
disclose the price to you, suffice to say it's a heavily discounted 
price which we could have not gotten before."
    
He said: "We are working out an arrangement where the configuration 
of these aircraft is changed according to our needs and 
requirements and negotiations are under way to reach such an 
agreement."
    
Asked about the financing arrangements for these aircraft 
purchases, Abbasi said: "Financing is available. What we are aiming 
for is Exim Bank, which is concessional credit, that makes these 
purchases very viable. But these are not open yet to Pakistan, due 
to sanctions imposed on May 28. Hopefully by PM's visit in December 
Exim Bank financing will be available."
    
"The Exim Bank deal is the best", he added, saying "These are other 
options like leasing, lease and purchase, but the Exim Bank option 
which was not available to us until now will work out the best," he 
added.
    
"We have made provisions to get four aircraft and have options to 
buy four more depending on the traffic."
    
When the PIA chairman was asked to comment on reports of grounding 
of several aircraft at PIA's hub in Karachi, he said "these are 
really exaggerated. It so happened that one day ten aircraft came 
in for servicing out of which only two were in fact grounded for 
want of parts."
    
He pointed out that in the last several months Pakistan Airlines 
has had 93 per cent on time operations. "We are undertaking 
measures to computerize all our operations and scheduling which 
until now were being done manually on paper and pencil."
    
TURN AROUND: Abbasi said: "We are making a turn around and holding 
our own despite competition from foreign airlines, who have 
acquired landing rights.
    
"We have cut airlines operating costs by 60 million dollars. We 
have paid off the golden handshakes people, we cut costs by 
outsourcing and by reducing the employees. We will save this year 
alone over one billion rupees in payroll costs alone. "

<a name="none">No new taxes proposed: IMF insists on dues recovery, rise in GST</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report
    
ISLAMABAD, Nov 13: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has asked 
the government to drastically improve its declining revenues by 
recovering Rs57 billion, outstanding against various government 
departments, instead of raising utilities and tax rates.
    
During the third day of the continued talks being held between the 
visiting IMF mission headed by Ms Sena Eken and minister for 
finance and commerce Ishaq Dar, the issue of revenue slippage came 
up for detailed discussion. CBR's unofficial lowering of annual 
collection target from Rs352 billion to Rs298 billion was also 
discussed.
    
Informed sources told Dawn that the seven-member IMF mission drew 
the attention of the government side, which also included the 
Governor State Bank of Pakistan, on Rs57 billion's receipts still 
to be recovered from various organizations.
    
It was said that sale proceeds worth Rs18 billion were struck up 
with the buyers of the state sector enterprises, while Rs 12billion 
were due against WAPDA, Sui Northern and Sui Southern gas 
companies. Moreover, receipts of Rs 27 billion were stuck up in the 
litigation involving the cases related to tax under the heads of 
custom duty, sales tax, income tax and central excise. The 
remaining amount was to be recovered from the defaulters of the 
electricity and gas users.
    
"The mission has not proposed us to levy new taxes but they do ask 
us to recover old dues which are, off course, in billions", said an 
official of the ministry of finance.
    
However, the government side, sources said, assured the IMF mission 
that the rate of general sales tax was being increased from 12.5 
per cent to 15 per cent to be effectively imposed shortly.
    
The IMF team members complained that the GST which was agreed upon 
by the traders community last year was not being recovered in 
letter and spirit.
    
Sources said that the IMF mission was also insisting that Pakistan 
must have a unified exchange rate as the growing disparity between 
the official and kerb rates was not good for the economy. But 
Pakistan told the IMF mission that dual exchange rate could not be 
ended immediately. However assurances were offered to resolve the 
issue within next two months period.
    
Similarly the government side, sources said, expressed its 
inability to devalue rupee vis a vis dollar. "Ishaq Dar is too 
tough on this issue and he may not easily concede", said an 
official of the multilateral agency. When contacted he said that 
donors very strongly felt that Pakistan needed new adjustments in 
its currency. "Perhaps the circumstances are not right for 
devaluation", he said adding that since G- 7 countries have lifted 
partial sanctions, IMF, World Bank and the Asian Development Bank 
did not want to push their conditionalities with a view to help the 
country to overcome its economic difficulties.
    
Sources said although the issue of Independent Power Producers 
(IPPs) has resolved to some extent, the IMF mission asked the 
Pakistani authorities to resolve its differences with HUBCO and 
KAPCO power companies without going into litigation.
    
Pakistan was told that in case both the power companies decided to 
seek the intervention of any international tribunal or the 
International Chamber of Commerce, it may not help the government. 
Moreover, it will not help the government to invite fresh foreign 
investment in Pakistan.

<a name="high">High prices of fertilizer may hit wheat target</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Nov 12: The high target of over 20 million tons of wheat 
production in 1998-99 may be in jeopardy because of the 
malpractices in the distribution of chemical fertilizer.
    
The problem is particularly serious due phosphatic fertilizers as 
the dealers were selling these at black market rates. What is even 
more crucial for fulfilling the target is the persistent complaint 
that some unscrupulous elements were selling fake DAP fertilizer 
and that too at inflated rates.
    
When this matter was broached with a senior official of the 
ministry of food & agriculture he said that the distribution of 
fertilizer was the responsibility of the provincial governments. It 
is at the provincial level that the dealers are appointed without 
any criteria being determined for their selection.
    
According to reliable source, however, dealerships have been 
awarded on the basis of recommendations of the members of 
assemblies belonging to the ruling party. It is, therefore, very 
difficult, if not impossible, for the provincial authorities to 
exercise any discipline on the dealers.
    
The target for the ensuing Rabi crops was fixed in view of the 
expectation of higher off-take of fertilizer, particularly, the 
phosphatic fertilizer. For the 1998-99 Rabi crop, it was 
stipulated, the supply of urea, DAP and SOP would be increased by 5 
per cent, 10 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively.
    
On this basis, the ministry of food & agriculture had decided to 
arrange a line-up of 7,80,000 tons of DAP. The same source said he 
saw no reason for panic so far as the supply position was 
concerned. Arrangements had already been made for the import of six 
lakh tons  of DAP fertilizer; of this, 4 lakh would be imported by 
the government, he pointed out.
    
In this regard, he also pointed out that the phosphatic fertilizer 
would be needed at the time of first sowing or first water. Given 
the fact that the recent rains had forced the delay of sowing of 
Rabi crops, the requirement of phosphatic fertilizer in November 
had been estimated as 2,13,000 tons. The quantity of this 
fertilizer already in government stock was 65,000 tons.
    
This quantity was already available, as two lakh tons had already 
been imported, while 10,000 tons would be supplied before the end 
of November by the fertilizer factory which has been established 
recently at Port Qasim under a joint venture between Fouji 
Fertiliser and M/s Jardin. The same company had committed to supply 
another quantity of one lakhs by the first quarter of 1999, 
according to the source.
    
It was, however, feared that the offtake of fertilizer would 
decline owing to the decision by the State Bank of Pakistan to 
exclude chemical fertilizer from the list of items that could be 
imported under the official exchange rate of Pakistani rupee, 
implying that the country would have to import the item at the 
inter-bank rate which is higher by about Rs6 than the official rate 
of Rs46 per US dollar.
    
Consequently, the ministry has raised the prices of DAP and TSP 
(Triple Super Sulphate) by a big margin to Rs688 and Rs552, 
respectively.
    
According to a market observer, however, the offtake of DAP, which 
had shown some improvement last year, is likely to go down by as 
much as one lakh tons this year. So the actual requirement would be 
much below the target, thus further easing the supply situation. 
This has serious implications for the government's efforts to raise 
the per acre yield of wheat, he further commented.

<a name="fore">Forex reserves down to $424m</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 12: Liquid foreign exchange reserves of Pakistan fell 
by $34 million to $424 million on November 7 - hardly enough to 
foot a two-week import bill - from $458 million on October 31.
    
The State Bank said on Thursday that on November 7 the country had 
$294 million worth of approved forex reserves and $130 million 
worth of cash and short term securities held abroad. The two 
figures stood at $348.36 million and $109.25 million on October 31.
    
Senior bankers link the $34 million fall in the reserves over a 
week to shortfall in export earnings and foreign remittances. 
Pakistan witnessed a 10 per cent fall in its exports in October. 
Imports also declined but reduced export earnings and low foreign 
remittances kept the total supply of foreign exchange below the 
demand axis.
    
On May 19 this year Pakistan had $1.4 billion worth of forex 
reserves that fell to $1.2 billion on May 28 - the day it conducted 
a nuclear blast. 
   
Consequent economic sanctions imposed by the developed countries 
and an overall mess-up in the economy started taking their toll on 
the reserves that dropped to $531 million on July 24. Immediately 
afterwards Pakistan managed to secure a $250 million soft-term loan 
from Kuwait and the reserves rose to $795 million on August 4.
    
But the build-up proved temporary and the reserves again began to 
decline gradually despite the fact that the government stopped 
providing foreign exchange for overseas travelling and education 
etc.
    
It is against this backdrop that Pakistan is striving hard to 
secure a $5 billion rescue package from IMF including a $3 billion 
worth of external loan rescheduling to avoid defaults. 
    
The two sides are currently engaged in the final round of talks in 
Islamabad. The talks may conclude within a week or so.

<a name="$420m">$420 million dollar bonds supplied to banks</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Nov 11: The State Bank has so far supplied $420 million 
worth of fresh dollar bonds to both local and foreign banks but 
bankers say people are yet to show a real interest in these bonds.
    
Stock brokers also say trading in the bonds is yet to take place. 
The bonds were listed on Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) on Tuesday 
but their trading is restricted amongst the members only. KSE said 
on Wednesday that settlement of bonds trading would take place on 
delivery versus payment system. That is delivery of the bonds shall 
take place simultaneously with the payment for the same being made 
by the buying member to the selling member through a pay order.
    
KSE sources say the bonds may soon be put on computerized trading 
system known as Karachi Automated Trading System (KATS) and the 
general public may be allowed to buy and sell these.
    
Changes were made on Friday in the US dollar bonds scheme launched 
on July 22 to make it more attractive by reducing their maturity 
periods and increasing the rates of return.
    
Senior bankers told Dawn that both local and foreign banks got $420 
million worth of 3-year bonds up to November 11 foreseeing them as 
more lucrative than 5-year and 7-year bonds.
    
Both bankers and stock brokers say much about the sale of fresh 
bonds would depend on whether the extension in the November 30 
deadline set for liquidation of foreign currency deposits used as a 
collateral for rupee loans is extended or not. The matter is 
currently under litigation and under the court orders the State 
Bank has extended the deadline up to November 30. Bankers say if 
the deadline is not extended further then the depositors would 
naturally look towards the dollar bonds which can now be used as 
collateral against loans.
    
They say that another reason for the people not showing any 
interest in these bonds is the air of uncertainty in economic 
arena. They say many corporate and big individual clients of the 
banks are waiting for the results of Pakistan-IMF talks on a 
possible $5 billion rescue package for the country. 
    
Now that the State Bank composite exchange rates have reached 
closer to Rs 51.57 and Rs 51.97 per dollar for spot buying and 
selling the holders of foreign currency deposits frozen are finding 
it extremely painful to convert these deposits at a special rate of 
Rs46 per dollar.
    
That is why they are rather waiting for an upfront devaluation of 
the rupee which the government has ruled out but the IMF is 
believed to have been pursuing so that they could get more in 
rupees out of their frozen deposits. Many of them also believe that 
the government might have to phase out the dual exchange rates 
system after concluding a loan package with IMF that may help the 
depositors get a better exchange rate for their frozen deposits.
    
"We will have to wait till the end of talks with the IMF to see the 
people taking a genuine interest in the bonds," said former KSE 
president Arif Habib. He said the rates of return being offered 
through the bonds are much higher than what the banks are offering 
on foreign currency accounts at the moment and as such "the bonds 
may attract reasonable response."
    
Arif Habib and many other stock brokers feel that the move to 
declare the bonds a registered as well a bearer instrument will 
also make them popular among those who want to whiten their ill- 
gotten money. 
     
But both bankers and stock brokers agree that what restricts the 
scope of these bonds is the fact that people are yet to come out of 

the shock the May 28 freezing of their foreign currency deposits 
afforded to them. "Be it a dollar bond scheme or something 
else...if the public confidence remains  shaken it could not take 
off," said a banker.

<a name="expo">Exports fall by 10pc in July-Oct '98</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Nov 10: The exports of Pakistan totalled $2,459 million 
during the first four months (July-October) of current financial 
year denoting a fall of 10 per cent compared to the corresponding 
period of last year, according to the trade figures available from 
an official source.
    
On the positive side, however, due to continued slide of imports, 
which amounted to $2815 million, the trade deficit dropped to $356 
million, a decline of 62 per cent. During the corresponding period 
of last year, the import bill had stood at $3664 million, making 
for a trade deficit of $931 million.
    
The official policy to boost exports has not yielded positive 
results as is evident from the fact that the month of October 
failed even to match the figure for September. Like the downward 
swing of imports, the exports in October plunged to $614 million 
and imports to $713 million in October.
    
When compared with October, 1997, exports decreased from $713 
million by 13.9 per cent and the imports from $1,024 million by 
30.4 per cent. Every month of the current financial year has been 
marked by a marked decline in exports, when compared with the 
corresponding month of previous year, as evident from the 
following:
    
*July, 1998: exports ($585.75 million) were lower than those of 
July, 1997 by 11.54%; and those of June 1998 by 13.32%;
    
*August, 1998: exports ($605.7 million) were higher by 2.3% than 
those of July, 1998, but lower than those of August 1997 by 12.44%;
    
*September, 1998: exports ($630 million), lower than those of 
September 1997 by 7.31% and those of August 1998 by 1.01%; and
    
*October, 1998: exports ($614 million), lower than those October 
1997 by 13.88% and those of September 1998 by 2.53%.
    
The exports performance in October 1998, also finds the country 
lagging way behind the target of $10 billion for the current 
financial year. At the end of the first four months, not even a 
quarter of that target had been achieved. This means that during 
the remaining year, it would be necessary to ensure that the 
exports are not less than $942.7 million every month on average.
    
In view of the dismal performance of exports sector over the past 
couple of years, this seems to be a tall order because the average 
so far has been only $614.75 million.

<a name="busi">Businessmen favour linking rupee to Euro</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 10: Businessmen trading with European countries favour 
linking of the Pakistani rupee to the Euro currency backed by 

eleven European Union (EU) economies.
    
These exporters say that a major share in $20 billion external 
trade is presently with European countries, responsible for 
launching the Euro currency from Jan 1, 1999.
    
"We do not want the government to act in haste but we strongly feel 
that Pakistan is lagging far behind in its preparations to meet the 
emerging development on the world currency markets," a leading 
exporters to EU member countries said.
    
Pakistan's annual exports to EU rank second at an estimated value 
of $2.640 billion and exports to American region including USA is 
estimated at $1.640 billion. Similarly, imports also assume almost 
same position with EU countries.
    
What is more alarming to the exporters of EU countries is that the 
government has not done any homework to face the new challenges on 
the world currency markets with the advent of the Euro. "Hardly any 
government ministry or the State Bank of Pakistan have taken up 
this matter which we are going to face within next 50 days," 
another exporter lamented.
    
Prior to US dollar about 20 years back Pakistani rupee was linked 
to Pound Sterling and once again time has come for taking a bold 
decision in this regard. Pakistan after giving due weightage to all 
the aspects of external trade and currencies should fully or 
partially link up its currency with Euro.
    
Chairman Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association (PBEA) Shabir Ahmed 
suggested that a committee should be formed under the chairmanship 
of the prime minister for taking this decision which will have far 
reaching consequences on the country's economy.
    
He said that even today the European buyers feel more comfortable 
when the payments are made in their home currencies and if we opt 
for Euro, Pakistan would be linking its currency with eleven strong 
economies of the world rather than with single economy which is 
more prone to rapid variation even in case of small local events 
taking place in the US.

<a name="sart">Sartaj for 1/3rd forex reserves in euro</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 7: Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz on Saturday termed the 
emergence of euro as a common currency of Europe from January next 
year a very healthy development and a positive diversification for 
countries like Pakistan to maintain their foreign exchange 
reserves.
    
�No official policy has been framed on this issue,� the foreign 
minister replied to a question from a business executive after he 
had delivered his talk on �International Economic Developments and 
their impact on Pakistan�subject of the seminar organized by the 
Management Association of Pakistan.
    
Sartaj Aziz was asked in the question-answer session to brief 
participants of the seminar on official position of the government 
on launching of euro from January 1999. China, he was informed has 
already announced to maintain a substantial chunk of its foreign 
exchange reserves in Euro.
    
He, however, offered his personal views on the issue and said that 
since one-third of Pakistan�s imports originate from Europe he 
would suggest maintaining at least one-third of foreign exchange 
reserves in Euro. Half of the reserves, he pointed, could be 
maintained in dollars and for the balance there could be a flexible 
decision based on trade and flow of currency trends.
    
The foreign minister expressed the hope that Europe will emerge as 
powerful centre of trade and production with a strong Euro. He said 
the elections in European countries have brought left leaning 
parties. These parties, he expects, would continue the same 
economic policies of course with marginal changes to maintain 
growth in production and trade.
    
He spoke at length on miraculous development of the Asian 
countries, each of them showing average growth rate of 9 to 10 per 
cent for quite a long period and then their sudden collapse some 15 
months ago when all their macro economic indicators showed positive 
signs.
    
�One question that emerges repeatedly is its suddenness. There was 
literally no warning from any responsible quarter about an 
impending crisis,� Sartaj Aziz, who was for a long time the finance 
minister in Nawaz Sharif cabinet pointed out.
    
The roots of the crisis, he said can be traced to the large flow of 
unregulated and inadequately flow of private capitals to the 
affected countries going into imprudent lending to sectors like 
property or services.
    
The foreign minister underlined four major risks that are involved 
in the globalization and was of the view that only developed 
countries have benefited from it while the least developed 
countries have hardly benefited.
    
He said the emerging economies have been wounded by volatile short 
term capital flows, irresponsible speculative trading in currencies 
and unregulated and free movement of vast capital in and out of the 
countries at staggering speed.
    
Globalization has accentuated income disparities amongst and within 
countries with negative implications for the welfare of large 
segments of population.
    
And fourthly, he said that it was beyond the capacity of individual 
countries to manage the process of globalisation.
    
Pakistan, he observed was able to escape the contagion effects of 
this crisis of Asian countries because it has yet not opted for 
capital account convertibility. �It would have to use this option 
very carefully, dovetailed with reforms of banking and financial 
sector,� he stressed.
    
In backdrop of all these international developments, the foreign 
minister said that there were many lessons for Pakistan of which 
first and foremost is to develop competitiveness.
    
Pakistan�s economy, he said was passing through a recessionary 
phase and requires extensive investment, both from domestic and 
foreign sources for a recovery.
    
While pointing out that Pakistan�s economic problems were 
compounded by the sanctions imposed on it after May 28 nuclear 
blast Sartaj Aziz said that with only one year recovery record in 
1997-98 the country was not able to withstand these restrictions.
    
According to him, Pakistan was ahead India in economic development 
and reforms in 1991 but as he contended the setback came in the 
subsequent years up to 1996-97. In 1997-98. 
     
He said some recovery was made in the economic development but not 
strong enough to meet the situation created by the sanctions.
    
He urged the businessmen to rise to the occasion and develop 
competitiveness particularly in exports. Sartaj Aziz was pretty 
harsh on the textile tycoons, who he pointed out are happy on 
earning one billion dollars through export of yarn.
    
If converted into cloth, this yarn can help in fetching 5 billion 
dollars, a better quality cloth 10 billion dollars and quality 
readymade garments perhaps 15 billion dollars a year, he said.
    
In question-answer session, the business executives were quite 
harsh and blamed the government of shaking the confidence of the 
people, investors and savers by freezing foreign currency accounts 
and subsequent measures. 
     
The finance minister was at a loss to answer when asked to explain 
the fiscal measures taken to generate the implementation of 
generous packages announced by the prime minister.

<a name="hubc">Hubco earns net profit at Rs10.8 billion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dilawar Hussain

KARACHI, Nov 12: The Hub Power Company Limited (Hubco) announced 
net profit at Rs 10.8 billion, equivalent to earning per share 
(EPS) at Rs 9.34 for the year ended June 30, 1998.
    
The financial figures were the same as the unaudited numbers 
unveiled by the company in early August.
    
The accounts audited by statutory auditors Ford, Rhodes, Robson, 
Morrow, were approved by the Board of Directors, which met in Dubai 
on Wednesday. The Board also appointed Syed Khurshid Husain, the 
Finance Director and Company Secretary, as the company's Chief 
Executive.
    
The board, however, decided to skip the final dividend, which drew 
mixed reaction from energy stock analysts.
    
Rumours were rife that the directors might recommend final dividend 
in excess of Rs 4 per share or 40 per cent. This, some thought, 
would add to the already robust Rs 7 or 70 per cent interim paid 
earlier.
    
But other analysts said that such expectations did not make sense, 
considering that this largest independent power project was 
embroiled in bitter battle with the government on issues ranging 
from high tariff to alleged bunglings and kick-backs. "The company 
is also facing acute liquidity crunch, which actually ruled out a 
cash payout", said one analyst.
    
He recalled that even Engro had omitted the final dividend in its 
Wednesday announcement, citing government's moratorium on 
remittances of loan instalments due to overseas lenders, as the 
reason.
    
"Hubco would also not have been able to remit to the foreign 
investors their share of the dividend and hence the decision to 
omit", he said.
    
The share gained 80 paisa to close at Rs 13.80 on the regular 

trading on Thursday, but a broker said that the stock had made up 
to Rs 14.20 in the curb trading late in the afternoon.
    
Hubco also posted 40.4 per cent improvement in turnover to Rs 25.7 
billion for the year to end-June 1998 from Rs 18.3 billion a year 
ago.

<a name="stoc">Stocks lose 26.02 points on weakness of base shares</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Nov 13: Stocks on Friday ran into weekend profit-selling 
at the inflated levels despite some good news including tariff cut 
by some of the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and fairly 
encouraging dividend news from Grays of Cambridge, whose management 
came out with a cash dividend of 160 per cent plus bonus shares at 
the rate of 40 per cent.
    
The underlying sentiment remained uppishly inclined thanks to the 
absorption of bulk of the selling at the falling prices.
    
"It is a good sign witnessed after quite sometime as each technical 
correction always leads to a grand rebound," Fasil Abbas, a leading 
stock analyst at AHRA, said.
    
Being slightly in an overbought position owing to sustained run-up 
of the last four sessions, the market needs a correction and that 
came in the form of selling from jobbers and short-term dealers, he 
added.
    
The KSE 100-share index suffered a decline of 26.02 points at 
941.92 as compared to 967.98 a day earlier, reflecting the weakness 
of leading base shares.
    
"News that five IPPs have agreed to cut their power tariff rates by 
8 to 10 per cent, a net saving of Rs 19.5 billion for the 
government, should have buoyed investors as it could lead to 
identical deals with others," Zubair Ellahi said.
    
"But they seem to have some reservations about the deal as leading 
among them including Hub-Power remained out," they added.
    
All the energy shares fell in unison apparently on the perception 
that the cut in rates could lower their annual profits and the 
consequent selling.
    
Analysts said passing over of the final dividend by the management 
of Hub-Power despite a hefty profit of Rs 10.8 billion for the year 
owing perhaps to litigation over the power tariff issue seems to be 
the major factor behind the sell-off. Its management has already 
paid an interim dividend at the rate of 70 per cent for the year 
ended June 30, 1998.
    
"Some of the negative psychological factors are there. The reaction 
is essentially technically-motivated and there are no reasons to be 
that pessimist as the direction of the market is upward," said a 
leading broker.
    
Rumours of possible hostile takeover bid of fertilizer giant, Engro 
Chemical, by a leading local industrial group to grab its floating 
stock are at its peak as was reflected by steep increase in its 
share value and large volume but it is not that easy, he added.
    
"A selling giant with annual sales turnover of over Rs 1.5 billion 
and having an enormous fund and strong reserves base could hardly 
be browbeaten on the trading in that way and that too through 
hostile-takeover bids," observed a member of the KSE.
The most active list was topped by Hub-Power, off 25 paisa at Rs 
13.55 on 40 million shares, followed by PTCL, down Rs 1.35 on 35 
million shares, ICI Pakistan, up 65 paisa at Rs 13.35 on 13 million 
shares, PSO, easy Rs 1.25 on 4 million shares, and Southern 
Electric, lower 20 paisa at Rs 8.55 on 2 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares were led by Japan Power, easy five 
paisa on 1.403 million shares, FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, off 40 paisa 
on 1.340 million shares, Sui Northern, lower 60 paisa on 0.969 
million shares, Dewan Salman, off 55 paisa on 0.894 million shares, 
and KESC, easy 35 paisa on 0.722 million shares.
    
DIVIDEND: Balochistan Wheels, 20 per cent cash, Artisic Denim, cash 
20 per cent, and Askari Leasing, cash 20 per cent, Dilon, cash 35 
per cent, PNSC, nil, aftertax profit Rs 10.18 million, Grays 
Leasing, nil, aftertax profit Rs 16.3 million, Asian Stock Fund, 
nil, aftertax loss Rs 38.5 million.

<a name="thel">The loose cannon</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee

TO call our prime minister a loose cannon would be to do him great 
injustice for one would be underestimating his propensities.
    
Having made a right royal mess and, for reasons that can never be 
justified, sequestered our dollars after he exploded his bomb on 
May 28, on October 12 we read a front-page headline in this 
newspaper informing us that he had declared in Lahore on the 11th 
that he would unfreeze our foreign exchange accounts when the 
situation improves.
    
How can you say that, one asks, we have no dollars, we are heavily 
in debt, home remittances have dwindled, we are earning no foreign 
exchange? Well, says he, I did not say that I would unfreeze 
tomorrow. I will pay back when I have the dollars. Next month? one 
asks. No, says he, when Allah wills it so.
    
Then, on October 16, came the headline: �PM unveils Rs.24 billion 
uplift plan for city.�
    
He had announced that, firstly, the single-track Karachi 68 km 
circular rotting railway project would be renewed and turned into a 
double-track system, with many more stations, at the cost of $ 150 
million (Rs.7.5 billion), so as to ease the city�s transport 
problem. Bids would be invited within a month, and the railway made 
operational in two and a half years.
    
Can this be done? Yes, tracks can be laid but more money would be 
needed for fencing, for automatic signalling and level-crossing 
equipment, for locomotives and carriages. Is the PM aware that the 
country�s existing railway system is in a shambles, that the 
replacement of over 60 per cent of locomotion power and an equal 
percentage of rolling stock, plus the country�s main track renewal, 
are long overdue, that the carriage factory capable of 
manufacturing 270 carriages per annum is now only making 27, and 
all for lack of funds? Has someone told him that the Spezand-
Zahidan line laid in 1943 during WW2 using second-hand rails is 
about to become dysfunctional? No, all had nodded agreement. All 
had applauded.
    
Secondly, a 136-km six-lane motorway between Karachi and Hyderabad 
(M-9) is to be built at a cost of some Rs.7 billion and completed 
also in two and a half years. Is this motorway necessary? Is not 
the four-lane Karachi-Hyderabad super-highway more than sufficient 
for our needs? Can we afford duplication, waste? Irrelevant. The PM 
is programmed to come to unveil the foundation stone at the end of 
this month.
    
Has our PM counted the number of marble plaques that he and Benazir 
Bhutto between them have unveiled in this past decade for various 
hare-brained projects that have not taken off? Can we not encourage 
him to economize by removing all such plaques, having them re-
engraved and used for new impossible projects?
One is reminded of the time Benazir Bhutto laid the foundation 
stone of a children�s hospital to be constructed on a playing 
field. When I complained to the provincial health secretary, he 
assured me I should not worry; the children could be assured that 
they can continue to play their games. The promised aid from Japan 
had yet to come, and even the money needed for the stone and the 
ceremony had been borrowed from some other allocation.
    
Third in the PM�s package was the 63-km six-lane Northern Bypass 
(M-10) at a cost of Rs. 6 billion, again to be completed in two and 
a half years.
    
For these three projects the inauguration dates have optimistically 
been fixed for April 14, 15 and 16 respectively in the year 2001, 
when he intends to be with us in the same capacity together with 
his 2010 minister, Ahsan Iqbal. No disclosures were made as to from 
where the funds would come.
    
That same day that these startling pronouncements were made he laid 
the foundation stone for a 400-bed general hospital and kidney 
centre to be constructed by the Workers� Welfare Board at Landhi at 
a cost of Rs.300 million within three years. Will this, plus the 
existing hospitals in Karachi, suffice for the growing needs of the 
city?
    
Is the PM aware that from 200 to 300 million gallons per day of raw 
sewage comprising untreated industrial and domestic waste water is 
dumped into the sea at Karachi? This is more than massive pollution 
for atmosphere and man. What does this do to the marine creatures 
that feed on it and then what it does it do to us when such 
creatures end up on our table and we ingest intestinal bacterial 
pathogens?
    
Untreated industrial and domestic waste water is also used in 
certain areas of Karachi for the irrigation and growing of 
vegetables and fruit. This ad hoc system causes many diseases 
varying in severity from mild gastroenteritis to often fatal 
dysentery, cholera and typhoid. The waste contains carcinogenous 
and mutagen metals and non-metals which cause loss of energy, 
gastro-intestinal, renal and neurological disturbances. A high 
concentration of chemicals can even cause fatal kidney damage, 
birth defects and damage to the central nervous system.  To give 

the layman some idea of the volume of toxic sewage dumped into our 
sea each day, one day�s outflow would fill to capacity two of the 
largest super-tankers ever built, Globtik London and Globtik Tokyo 
(each of: 213,894 GRT; 184,541 NRT; and 483,933 dead weight Tons).
    
Now for attention to the problem at hand  our dying city. That its 
administration now rests not solely with the corrupt and the 
terrorist-friendly political government has to be an improvement on 
what it was. People have faith in the fairness of the governor, but 
he sadly has little faith in the law enforcement agencies or in the 
chiefs of these agencies thrust upon him by the federal government 
without consulting him. For instance, the newly appointed IGP of 
Sindh and the DIG, Karachi, both selected over the heads of scores 
of their seniors, by the PM himself, report directly to him, thus 
undermining the governor�s authority.
    
Then, under orders from the federal government, those accused of 
having committed grave crimes and granted parole simply for 
political considerations have not been reapprehended. The rounding-
up of alleged criminals has so far been highly selective, depending 
on the exigencies of the PM and his government. The people fear an 
impending kiss-and-make-up scenario.
    
Equally unsettling is the fact that politicians of various hues are 
straining at the leash to be appointed �advisers� to the governor. 
Fatal. If there are to be �advisers� they must be men and women who 
have no political affiliations, are neutral citizens, genuinely 
disturbed by the province�s plight, those with the will and ability 
to advise wisely and, most importantly, fearlessly.
    
Terrorism will not end overnight. Peace, law and order will take at 
least a year to stabilize into some sort of permanency. Thereafter, 
we may have a climate of safety suitable for industrial and 
commercial investment, for development.
    
There are too many guns, too many automatic weapons in the hands of 
those who under no conceivable law should be allowed to handle 
them. There are too many stray bullets flying around, targeted or 
otherwise. As I stood burying my friend Khwaja Rahman on Friday, I 
wondered how many of those standing beside me knew that he was 
going to his grave with a bullet embedded in the muscles between 
his shoulder blades, a bullet that had found its target way back in 
the days of his and my friend Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, when the gun and 
bullet culture was born.
    
Before Bhutto came to power, he and Mana (for that�s how Khwaja 
Rahman was known to his family and friends) had an exchange of 
words at the Sind Club (in the days when it really was a Club and 
qualified as such). Mana was riling Zulfikar for his stupidity, his 
blind ambition, and a high and swinging Zulfi spat at him. �You 
wait, when I become president I will see you.� Mana laughed, � But 
wait, if you do become president, I will not see you.�
The wait was not long. Bhutto became president. One day in the 
early 1970s as Mana was driving home along Queen�s Road, the tyres 
of his car were shot, the car swerved and overturned, but Mana 
emerged unscathed. A second attempt was made another day when Mana 
was in the Boat Club. He was called out on some pretext and 
government gunmen lying in wait outside the Club House fired at 
him.
   
Fortunately, he was so well-padded that the bullet did not get to 
any vital organ, but it was lodged in such an awkward place that 
the doctors decided it would be safer to leave it alone. May Mana�s 
jolly soul rest in peace.
    
For the time being, Karachi remains moribund. The citizens and the 
civil servants must help the governor�s administration.

<a name="noth">Nothing but the best</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain
    
THE 3-0 drubbing Australia just handed Pakistan in the one-day 
cricket competition came on the heels of our early exit from the 
recent competition in Dhaka and the loss of the Test series to 
Australia.
    
Almost concurrently, we were defeated at hockey in the Champions 
Trophy, while Jansher Khan, almost the only world class squash 
player we can now boast of, has sunk out of sight in the world 
rankings. These were the only three sports we were ever any good 
at, and from the look of things, there is no likelihood that we 
will recover our dominance in the near future. It is not just that 
the rest of the world is getting better at these games, standards 
here are falling.
    
In themselves, victory and defeat are an integral part of sports, 
and we should be able to face either without going over the top or 
resorting to national breast-beating. But in Pakistan's case, our 
current decline on the international scene reflects a long-term 
trend that has been visible for some time. The fact that we could 
not defend a total of 315 in a 50-over match speaks volumes for our 
dwindling bowling resources.
    
There is no squash player around who looks remotely capable of 
assuming the mantle of the Great Khans who dominated the sport for 
four decades. In hockey, even South Korea defeated us in one of the 
round-robin games of the Champions Trophy. Basically, there has 
been a sudden dearth of explosive raw talent available for 
selection to the national teams.
    
For years now, victories in cricket, hockey and squash provided the 
people of Pakistan with some solace. We rejoiced when our boys won 
laurels around the world. There was political repression and 
economic deprivation, but despite these grim realities, we got some 
vicarious pleasure and a nationalistic buzz when our players beat 
the best in the world.
    
But over time, other teams began improving techniques and fitness 
while we tended to stagnate. Our coaches continued to drill 
youngsters with outdated methods, and we simply lost our 
competitive edge. In hockey, the advent of Astroturf revolutionized 
the game and handed the advantage to fitter players. Also, for some 
mysterious reason, we have simply never mastered the science of 
penalty-corner conversion. In squash, none of the current crop of 
players seems to have the mental discipline needed to maintain the 
awesome level of fitness required to succeed. In cricket, we have 
self-destructed by subjecting the whole team to an endless witch-
hunt over allegations of betting and match-fixing. Also, poor 
match-fitness resulted in key players being unavailable in the 
recent series against Australia.
    
But more than a column about sports, this should be read as a 
metaphor for the malaise that is eating into every institution and 
field of activity in Pakistan. As a nation, we have become so used 
to the easy way out and the soft option that we are no longer 
prepared to put in the hard slog necessary to get to the top. I am 
not an advocate of endless competition, but without the will to 
win, nations stagnate and fall into a stupor from which few emerge. 
How many of the people reading this piece even bothered to cheer 
our team in the recent cricket series against Australia. I know I 
didn't. In other countries, large crowds turn up to support their 
teams, but progressively, the numbers in Pakistan have fallen.
    
Basically, we have become so used to taking short cuts to get what 
we want that we assume this approach will work in sports as well. 
To some degree, this works at the national level because everybody 
is doing it. But at the international level, forget it. Indeed, 
sports played at the national level have become an embarrassing 
irrelevance. Nobody watches them, and even the competitors seem to 
be going through the motions without any commitment. Sports writers 
tend to blame our organizers for this state of affairs, but the 
problem goes far deeper.
    
The whole makeshift, "chalta hai" outlook has eroded our 
competitive spirit and our will to win. Instead of hard work, we 
tend to rely on "pull" and connections. As in sports, so in other 
walks of life, we enter the arena without the conviction that we 
will win. Without this self-assurance, we are defeated before we 
even begin. The French have an expression "elan vital" that roughly 
translates into a zest, a drive and a will to win. Somewhere along 
the road, we seem to have lost this essential ingredient for 
success.
    
Our entire spectrum of national life can be viewed as a living 
proof of my argument. Students are not willing to put in the work 
needed to shine, resorting to short cuts like "guess papers" and 
cheating to get through. Management in every organization complains 
of interference from unions or from politicians. Pakistan 
International Airlines is a classic example of our decline: in the 
sixties, it was reckoned as one of the best airlines in the world; 
today it is one of the worst. None of this happened overnight. As 
leadership and governance have deteriorated progressively, we have 
lost the motivation to excel. Indeed, a system that does not reward 
excellence is unlikely to be rich in it.
    
We have reached a point where virtually the only Pakistanis who do 
well are expatriates who have shed the Pakistani work ethic and are 
therefore to compete with the best everywhere. Despite their 
initial handicap, it is reassuring to know that some of them have 
risen to the very top. Indeed, even those Pakistani sportsmen who 
have done well are the ones who competed abroad at an early point 
of their careers.
    
So what is it about our environment that saps us of drive, energy 
and the "elan vital"? Basically, our willingness to put up with 
mediocrity acts as a disincentive to aspire to become the best. We 
tolerate laziness, a lack of commitment and fudged results in every 
walk of life, so we should not be dismayed when these attitudes 
become all-pervasive and infect everyone and everything.
    
How and when will this trend be reversed? It won't until we stop 
making excuses for ourselves and live up to our true potential. And 
that, I am afraid, can only happen when we get a dynamic leadership 
that has vision and courage, and will accept nothing but the best. 
But don't hold your breath waiting for it to come along: 
ultimately, we have to decide that we will no longer tolerate the 
clowns, crooks and charlatans who have been taking us all for a 
ride for nearly five decades.

<a name="theg">The governor's challenge</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Eqbal Ahmad

HARD news and mean spirit greeted me in Karachi on October 30. A 
day earlier, the prime minister had accused the MQM of involvement 
in the murder of Hakim Said and, as though Nine Zero was a country, 
demanded that it surrender MPA Zulfiqar Haider and seven others 
suspects in the crime. MQM leaders rejected the chief executive's 
demand for 'extradition' of the alleged criminals. Instead, they 
accused the prime minister of Hakim Sahib's murder. This completed 
the cycle of accusation and counter-accusation, signalled the end 
of a marriage of convenience between the ruling Muslim League party 
and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement.
    
The motives of the one were as suspect as the innocence of the 
other. The official assertion of guilt was just that  an 
assertion. Yet given MQM's attachment to violence, its 
protestations of innocence sounded hollow. The only certainty was 
that the end of the unworthy alliance marked the beginning of 
another round of warfare between a Pakistani government and its 
former ally. The event once again symbolized the sorry state of 
this nation. There was little in it to celebrate except the end of 
an ill-fated alliance, and no cause to take sides. I was shocked, 
therefore, to find that the spirit of partisanship had been so 
aroused that even in the normally responsible section of the press 
there were those who jettisoned the fundamentals of good journalism 
no less than of the rule of law. One example should suffice.
    
In a well known English daily I read, on October 30, a front page 
"News Analysis" which carries assertions like these: " Confronted 
with overwhelming evidence [sic] implicating not just MQM 
activists, nor just an MQM MPA, but placing the scene of conspiracy 
at 90 Azizabad itself, the PM had no option left. ... if the PM was 
to become party to covering for the killers [sic] of Hakim Said, 
then that would have meant giving up the government's writ in 
Karachi." And this: "The MQM theoretically had the option of 
sacrificing the killers [sic] of Hakim Said, dissociating 
themselves from the deed [sic] as an aberration. ...." This is the 
language of prosecutors in dictatorships, not of journalism in a 
democracy. Here, the distance between allegation and conviction is 
traversed without evidence, and with official claims served up as 
proof "beyond reasonable doubt". Here we witness the crossing of a 
not-so-thin line between the rule of law and lawlessness, between 
the presumption of innocence and pronouncement of guilt. I can only 
hope that writers and editors, conservatives and liberals alike, 
shall ponder the price of such slips  for society, for themselves, 
and for their children's future.
    
Governor's rule has been imposed in Sindh. The judiciary shall rule 
on its legality. In Karachi, the prime minister's decision was 
cautiously welcomed by most middle and upper class people. Nearly 
all I spoke with supported Islamabad with caveats: 'provided Nawaz 
Sharif is not engaged in a power grab'; 'provided state terror is 
not substituted for official terror'; 'provided the enforcement of 
law is rational, selective, and evenhanded'. The working class 
folks I queried were less articulate and more cynical. "It's all 
politics", said a construction worker. "Nawaz Sharif wants all the 
power", said a mason. "Good if it brings peace and jobs; bad if it 
does not", was the cryptic comment of an unemployed matriculate. 
The ambivalence suggests that people are fed up with the violence 
and instability in the city, and behind the cynicism and doubts lie 
a deep-seated distrust of the government which is based on past 
experience. The prime minister and the governor will do well to 
take these facts and public attitude into account.
    
The MQM is expressly the prime target of the government's born-
again "principled policy." That is at the same time understandable 
and wrong. Understandable, because Pakistan's first urban, middle 
and lower class party, was born and has remained trapped in an evil 
triangle. A decade ago, two ranking MQM leaders had asked how I 
viewed their party and its future. MQM will have a bright future, I 
had said, if it can rid itself of three cults: the cult of 
personality, the cult of violence, and the cult of victimhood. A 
decade later, it is clear that this party has become so decisively 
ensnared in the deadly triangle that only an outside force can 
disentangle it.
    
But that demands from Pakistan's ruling establishment, which 
invokes Islam so often and opportunistically, the knowledge and 
wisdom of the ahl al-hall wa al-aqd of bygone days. It is wrong to 
make the MQM the sole target because Karachi suffers from other 
sources of violence and crime, including organized mafia, religious 
zealots, the break-away faction of the MQM, and elements even of 
the forces of law and order. It will take evenhanded integrity, 
time, intelligence work, and organization to sort these out.
    
Governor's rule is not a panacea. It can be a first step toward 
cleaning up a city long in the grip of violence, corruption and 
mismanagement provided other steps are taken  more or less 
simultaneously and in telescoped time. Some fundamental principles 
need be followed. Many of these have been identified in this space 
by colleagues and guests. As a reminder, and for the sake of 
reinforcement, I repeat the salients: One, the top echelon of 
administrators and enforcers must be men or women of the highest 
reputation for integrity and competence, and once assigned the 
objectives they should be allowed to function without political 
interference, which means without fear or favour. Ardeshir 
Cowasjee, who knows details which I do not, has written that this 
principle has been violated, and advocated the appointments of 
reputable officers as chief secretary and IG police.
    
Two, the rule of law must be observed. It is tempting to use second 
degree methods as a substitute for intelligence gathering and 
investigation. But they blur the distinction between law and crime, 
brutalize culture, and undermine the foundations of state and 
society. Lastly, in environments steeped in violence, corruption, 
and callous neglect of public services attempts at law enforcement 
do not succeed unless two conditions are fulfilled:
    
First, a link must be established in the public mind between 
government policy and the common good. Second, there ought to be a 
clear commitment to changing Pakistan's totally outdated structure 
of urban governance. During a brief encounter last week, I was 
impressed by Governor Moinuddin Haider's sincerity and open mind. 
He invited my suggestions for better governance. So, in the context 
of these two points, here are a few.
    
Sindh's resources  land, water, and energy  have long been 
appropriated by the few to the detriment of the majority. 
Successive governments have been effectively allied with the former 
against the latter. Given the complexity of urban life, in the city 
a variety of mafia and predators prey on the people. In the 
congested, fish bowl city environment these inequities and 
exploitations grate more than in rural areas, and citizens become 
dependent on false prophets, demagogues, and protection rackets. To 
break the hold of criminal or terrorist organizations, the state 
must demonstrate its will and commitment to serve public good.
    
This is not an easy and quickly deliverable challenge. Hence, it is 
important to begin by taking meaningful steps of lasting 
significance. If the government is genuinely serious, the governor 
ought to take decisions that can signal his government's good 
intent and changed priorities. Three opportunities are readily 
available.
    
Centrally located parcels of land can soon be available in Karachi 
as the Sabzi Mandi and the Central Jail are to be relocated from 
their present sites of some 15 and 25 acres respectively. Land 
grabbers await in great anticipation. The government can opt to 
serve the city's needs instead. To my knowledge, Karachi is the 
only metropolis in the world that has no central bus station. 
Illegal overnight parking of commercial vehicles is a source of 
great corruption in the city's traffic and police departments; in 

day time, it causes great congestion and traffic hazard in the 
city, and much inconvenience to citizens.
    
In 1992, a survey done by Arif Hasan, a well known architect and 
city planner, showed that on a strip of a mere one-and-a-half miles 
on Tariq Road, illegal vehicle parking and hawking yields traffic 
controllers and inspectors some 110 million rupees a month; their 
gain is of course the city's loss. The Sabzi Mandi site is ideal 
size and location for a comprehensively planned central bus 
station. Will the government make a legally binding commitment now 
to use the land, when vacated, for this purpose? If yes, it will 
have earned the right to a significant amount of public confidence. 
Similarly, the Central Jail site ought to be turned into a park. 
Karachi's public and the city's polluted environment beg for one.
    
There is another, easier opportunity to demonstrate a commitment to 
good governance and create some public confidence in government. In 
most cities of the world the ownership of public property is public 
knowledge. For example, New Yorkers can easily obtain information 
on their city's land holdings in Manhattan, Queens or Staten 
Island. Each year lists are published of disposable city 
properties. Transparency ensures, among other things, against 
corruption and mis-utilization of the city's resources. But not in 
Karachi. Citizens are permitted no knowledge of what the city owns. 
By design or not, secrecy aids corruption and underhand dealings. 
To his credit, as minister in the Sindh government Dr. Farooq 
Sattar agreed to make such information available and Rs. 500,000 
was allocated to collect the data on the city's real estate 
holdings. The decision had not been implemented when he recently 
went out of office. I hope this commitment can still be enforced to 
the fullest extent.
    
Terror in Karachi shall end only when the enforcement of law is 
lawfully carried out, and the purveyors of violence are isolated 
from the people by the assurance of the government's genuine 
commitment to restoring the city to health. On the other hand such 
practices as killings in custody, generalized torture, search-and- 
destroy operations, blanket arrests and extortions by the police 
shall reduce the government to the level of a criminal mafia and 
further undermine the legitimacy of the state. But even if the 
government is successful beyond expectation in restoring order, 
peace in Karachi cannot be sustained unless the city is invested 
with a viable new structure of governance that includes a 
meaningfully empowered city government and a metropolitan police 
force.
    
The darkness that threatens to engulf this country may be averted 
after all if we can begin to rebuild Pakistan's cities. Karachi, 
Pakistan's first capital, is still a good place from where to 
begin.

<a name="amja">Amjad is the new Pakistan Open squash champion</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A.Majid Khan

KARACHI, Nov 12: Unseeded world no 24 Amjad Khan crowned himself 
with glory by overpowering sixth seeded world no 16 Graham Ryding 
of Canada for another sensational victory in the thrilling final by 
15-8, 11-15, 15-9, 13-15, 15-9 to maintain Pakistan's unprecedented 
record in the 17th Pakistan Open squash which ended here on 
Thursday afternoon at the DHA Asif Nawaz Squash Complex.
    
It was the first major tournament victory of Peshawar-born 18-year 
old Amjad Khan, the third Pakistani after squash legend Jahangir 
Khan, who had won the championship for a record ten times, and 
record eight time world champion Jansher Khan, who had won six 
times. Struggling to regain his form and fitness after his knees 
surgery, Jansher did not defend the title this year.
    
Air Chief Marshal Pervaiz Qureshi Mehdi, Chief of the Air Staff and 
President of the Pakistan Squash Federation, who was the chief 
guest, presented the cup and winning cash prize of $7,000 of the 
$50,000 tournament to the champion. Air Chief Marshal P.Q.Mehdi 
also announced a cash prize of Rs.100,000 on behalf of the Pakistan 
Air Force for the winner.
    
Younus Dewan of Dewan Mushtaq Group, one of the major sponsors of 
the championship, announced a cash award of $2,000 for new champion 
Amjad Khan and $1,000 for Canadian runnerup Graham Ryding, 
scheduled to return home tomorrow afternoon. Ryding received the 
runnerup cash prize of US dollar 4,600.
    
Earlier, in his address at the prize distribution ceremony, Air 
Chief Marshal Zahid Anis, the PSF senior vice-president and 
chairman of the organising committee, expressed his satisfaction 
over Amjad Khan's magnificent and remarkable performance in winning 
the Pakistan Open. He has joined the two great Khans- Jahangir and 
Jansher - who had won the championship for ten and six times 
respectively. Air Marshal Zahid Anis said we have faith in the 
capabilities of the young Khan to carry the Pakistan flag in every 
part of the world to bring honour and glory for the nation.
    
He congratulated Amjad Khan on his victory and also praised the 
performance of Graham Ryding. He thanked the sponsors and all those 
who worked as a team to make the championship a great success.
    
The breakup of the prize money was - winner $7,000, runnerup - 
$4600 semifinals losers $2800, each quarterfinals losers $1700 
each, second round losers $1000 each and first round losers $500 
each.
    
The final, among others, was watched by former British Open 
champion Roshan Khan, his illustrious son Jahangir Khan, who has 
been recently elected as vice-president of the World Squash 
federation and former British Open winner Qamar Zaman, the vice-
president of the PSF.
    
In the 55-minute thrilling showdown, Amjad Khan gave a 
demonstration of attacking game. In this process he alsocommitted 
several unforced errors. Amjad was more deceptive to control the 
remarkable short rallies of tantalising drop, volley nick, boast 
and crosscourt. Amjad hit to get length but only far and few.

Nevertheless Amjad Khan, a great fighter, played skilfully against 
Graham Ryding, a brilliant stroke player, whose wrist flick and 
magnificent backhand drops often caught the young Khan on the wrong 
foot. Ryding enjoyed an edge on the front court but Amjad too 
turned equally aggressive in hiting perfect backhand drop. Amjad's 
volley to nick off serve often left the 23-year-old Canadian, who 
yesterday upset top seeded Ahmed Barada of Egypt, just guessing.
    
Squash legend Jahangir Khan said victory is good for national 
squash and praised the performance of the young Khan who has to 
work hard for the world challenge. Roshan Khan and Qamar Zaman, 
both former British Open champions, said Amjad Khan put up fine 
performance and his winning of the Pakistan Open showed that we 
have talented youngsters, needing further polishing through hard 
work.

LAHORE, Nov 8: Through tight marking, ball-possession and 
positional-play, Holland outwitted Pakistan by three goals to one 
(3-1) in the final to add the 20th Champions Hockey Trophy to its 
kitty of two big titles at the National Hockey Stadium on Sunday.
     
Holland completed a rare grand slam, having already won the 1996 
Atlanta Olympic hockey and World Cup at Utrecht last May.
     
A near-to-capacity crowd of 45,000 lovers of the game gave a 
standing ovation to the new champions as they ran a lap of honour 
after receiving the beautiful trophy from the President of Pakistan 
Muhammad Rafiq Tarar. The prize distribution among the teams was 
also shared by the former PHF president Air Marshal (retd.) Nur 
Khan (who introduced the Champions Trophy and the World Cup 
competitions), Punjab Governor Shahid Hamid, Chief Minister Shahbaz 
Sharif and the International Hockey Federation (FIH) top brass. 
Prominent among the FIH officials were president Juan Angel 
Calzado, senior vice-president Brig (retd.) Sheikh Manzoor Husain 
Atif and secretary General Else Brada.
     
The Dutch coach Roelant Oltmans rightly took pride in the most 
consistent and brilliant performance of his team during this 
tournament. However, the youthful Pakistan side had the consolation 
of beating the ultimate champions, Holland, by a convincing margin 
of 6-3 in the league match. South Korea who beat Pakistan 4-3 on 
first day received the Fairplay Trophy.  Pakistan's skillful and 
resourceful forward Atif Bashir was  awarded the "Best Player of 
the Champion Trophy amidst wild cheers from the big number of 
spectators.

<a name="aust">Australia clinch series against Pakistan 3-0</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, Nov 10: Displaying excellent planning, strong nerves  and 
team-work, Australia won the third and final One-day International 

against Pakistan by six wickets, making a clean sweep of the 
series 3-0 at the Qadhafi Stadium on Tuesday.
    
Facing a daunting task of overhauling Pakistan's big total of 315 
for eight in the stipulated 50 overs, Australia cantered home to 
score 316 for four with seven balls to spare in a match made 
memorable by a record four centuries.
    
Ricky Ponting, who top-scored with a brave knock of 124 not out, 
pulled Saqlain Mushtaq's fifth delivery of 49th over for a single 
to take Australia to a comfortable win. the sporting crowd gave him 
a standing ovation.
    
Earlier, Ponting had Salim Malik run out with a direct throw from 
point. Ponting was adjudged "Man-of-the-Match". He received the 
award from the Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif.
    
After opener Mark Waugh (13) was claimed leg before wicket by Wasim 
Akram at the total of 25, Australia's fight-back in the match was 
spearheaded by left-hand opener Adam Gilchrist (103) and Ricky 
Ponting, who added 193 runs for the second-wicket partnership off 
177 balls in 123 minutes. At the total of 218, the solid Australian 
wicket-keeper and opener Adam Gilchrist (103) jumped out of his 
crease for a big hit off the left-arm spinner and Pakistani skipper 
Aamir Sohail to be stumped by Moin Khan. By that time, Gilchrist 
had laid a foundation of the Australian innings just as Ijaz Ahmed 
had laid Pakistan's foundation early in the match. Gilchrist hit 12 
boundaries in his very fine knock which lasted 145 minutes. He 
faced 104 deliveries and hit the Pakistani bowlers to almost all 
parts of the ground.
    
Darren Lehmann (8) edged a ball from Salim Malik  to wicket-keeper 
Moin Khan at the total of 237.
    
Ponting found another reliable partner in skipper Steve Waugh (30) 
and both added 69 for the fourth wicket partnership off 59 balls, 
consuming only 38 minutes. Saqlain Mushtaq clean bowled the 
Australian captain on third ball of Pakistan's 47th over. Steve 
Waugh lifted Salim Malik over mid-wicket for an excellent six.
    
But by the time Steve Waugh was out, Australia had reached 306 for 
four and a win looked a foregone conclusion. Ponting and Michael 
Bevan (6) faced no difficulty in hauling the remaining ten runs for 
the victory.
    
Young Ponting occupied the crease for 187 minutes, played 129 balls 
and thrashed the Pakistani pacemen and spinners alike. He hit 10 
exquisitely-timed boundaries in his very fine knock.
    
Earlier, a productive fourth-wicket partnership of 162 off 167 
deliveries between Ijaz Ahmed (111) and Yousuf Yohanna (100) helped 
Pakistan build a respectable total of 315 for eight.
    
When Yousuf joined Ijaz at the crease, Pakistan innings was 
tottering at 73 for three. New opener Asif Mahmood had been out 
without scoring, captain Aamir Sohail could contribute 21 runs 
while the seasoned batsman Salim Malik was out for only two.
    
The partnership was finally broken by the left-arm spinner Darren 
Lehmann on second ball of his very first over as Ijaz tried to pull 
him, missed the delivery completely and got his stumps rattled.

Both Ijaz and Yousuf hit chanceless centuries. They took good 
measure of the Australian pace and spin bowlers and at no stage 
hesitated to punish loose deliveries.
    
Wasim Akram was third Pakistani run out on last ball of the 50th 
over sent down by Julian after contributing 13 runs. Azhar Mahmood 
hit Julian's delivery and after the two batsmen had run two, they 
tried to steal the third one after an overthrow. Wasim Akram failed 
to land his bat well in time in the crease and the TV umpire 
Iftikhar Malik, on second thought, declared him run out.
