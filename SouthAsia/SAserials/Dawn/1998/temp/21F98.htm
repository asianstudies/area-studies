Pakistan opposes attack on Iraq
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hasan Akhtar

ISLAMABAD, Feb 19: Pakistan on Thursday voiced its opposition to a 
possible US-led military strike against Iraq and stressed on 
diplomatic initiative to resolve the crisis.
    
Briefing reporters at a news briefing, a Foreign Office spokesman 
said Pakistan wanted full implementation of all UN resolutions 
without selectivity.
    
"We are very concerned about the suffering of Iraqi people," the 
spokesman said adding diplomatic efforts should be geared up to end 
the row.
    
The spokesman said Pakistan had made contingency plans for the 
safety of its diplomatic staff in Iraq in the event of a military 
strike.
    
He said that the Chinese leaders, in talks with Mr Sharif, had 
firmly opposed a military strike on Baghdad and demanded that the 
problem should be resolved diplomatically. The spokesman said 
Pakistan's position on the Iraq issue was similar to that of China.
    
Referring to Kashmir issue, the spokesman said the Chinese support 
to Pakistan's principled stand on the Kashmir issue had been 
consistent. The Chinese leadership reaffirmed the stand during Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif's recent visit to Beijing, which the Foreign 
Office described as "very significant" and "a landmark" in Sino-
Pakistan relations.
    
He said the Chinese agreement with Pakistan to stay as strong 
partners while entering the 21st century, was the highlight of Mr 
Sharif's meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Prime 
Minister Li Peng.
    
When reminded that the Chinese president (in 1996) had advised 
Pakistan to put the contentious issue, not amenable to settlement in 
the foreseeable future, which was generally taken to mean the 
Kashmir issue, on "back burner" for the present, the spokesman said 
the Chinese obviously implied that the issue be taken up by opening 
a dialogue on it, and that was what Pakistan did earlier last year 
by initiating talks between the foreign secretaries of India and 
Pakistan.

Education policy again deferred 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report 

ISLAMABAD, Feb 18: The federal cabinet on Wednesday once again 
deferred approval of the new education policy in order to seek 
opinion from educationists and other experts.

The prime minister directed authorities concerned to present the new 
education policy for a public debate on Feb 21 at the Convention 
Centre.

He said he would himself listen to recommendations for possible 
incorporation in the new policy. It would be formally launched on 
March 27 to coincide with the death centenary of Sir Syed Ahmad 
Khan.

The education minister presented the draft education policy in the 
light of recommendations made by a cabinet sub-committee.

The cabinet was informed that the policy aimed at improving the 
quality of education, increasing the literacy level and 
universalization of basic education.

Private sector participation will also be encouraged to cater for 
the increasing needs of a burgeoning population.

It has also been proposed that industrialists and agriculturists 
should be encouraged to set up educational institutions at their 
factories and farms to cater for the needs of workers' children.

Recommendations were made in the draft to make the examination 
system credible.

The cabinet was informed that the draft policy had been extensively 
discussed with provincial governments, federal agencies, 
universities, chambers of commerce and industry, the chairman of the 
National Assembly and Senate standing committees on education, 
eminent educationists, journalists and intellectuals.

CHINA VISIT: Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub briefed the cabinet on the 
recent visit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to China. He said there 
was a unanimity of views between the two countries on issues of 
mutual interest. The prime minister also briefed Chinese leaders on 
the Kashmir dispute.

The Chinese leaders stressed the need for solution of the Kashmir 
issue in accordance with UN resolutions. They also appreciated 
Pakistan's efforts for promoting the Kashmir cause and supported its 
stand, Mr Gohar Ayub said.

The cabinet was told that the investment conferences in China and 
Hong Kong were successful and generated a lot of interest among 
Chinese investors to invest in Pakistan, the foreign minister said.

PRIVATIZATION: The ministry of petroleum and natural resources 
presented a report on privatization of different organizations of 
the ministry to improve management efficiency and quality of 
service.

The cabinet was informed that the ministry had been able to contain 
the gas losses of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines and of Sui Southern Gas 
Company during the year.

Benazir to file two more references against Nawaz
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Staff Reporter

LAHORE, Feb 16: Ms Benazir Bhutto's counsel Babar Awan said here on 
Monday that he was going to file two disqualification references 
against Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during the current week on the 
charge of making 60 appointments against various posts in violation 
of the provisions of the constitution dealing with the service of 
Pakistan.

He told a news conference at a local hotel that one reference would 
be filed with the National Assembly speaker under the People's 
Representation Act, which will also be submitted to the chief 
election commissioner. The other reference would be filed with the 
chief ehtesab commissioner.

As many as 11 references have already been filed against the prime 
minister on various charges and another eight are being processed, 
Mr Awan said. He said it was a great achievement that unlike the 
government's references against the PPP chairperson, not a single 
reference had so far been declared unfit for further proceedings. 
Three government references against Ms Bhutto were recently returned 
by the CEC on the plea that he could not take any action on them 
under any law.

Mr Awan alleged that the prime minister had ordered appointment of 
'unskilled' colleagues or people who had already reached the age of 
retirement against some very high positions. As a result, the basic 
structure of the service of Pakistan stood destroyed. He alleged 
that salaries and benefits given to the new appointees had no 
parallel in any Asian country. He said he was ready to hold a debate 
on the point with the federal law minister.

Mr Awan said the new CBR Chairman, Mr Moeenuddin Khan, had been 
appointed at a monthly salary of Rs 1.6 million. Mr Khan, he pointed 
out, had already been given three years' salary in advance. The 
protocol provided to him was higher than that of a provincial 
governor, and the benefits given to him were more than permissible 
for the highest bureaucrat.

Leghari plans to launch political party
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 17: Former president Farooq Leghari, speaking at a 
seminar on 'Pakistan at the cross-roads' organized by the Southasia 
Forum in a local hotel on Tuesday, announced that he was working 
toward forming a new political party .

Replying to a question, he said: "Yes! I think it is important to 
have a new political party to fill in the vacuum and save Pakistan 
from down-slide. I'll 
work hard to form this party."

What initially appeared to be a stock-taking of Pakistan's 
performance during the last 50 years and the options available to it 
at the cross-roads of history, actually turned out to be a kick-off 
speech for Mr Leghari's party in the offing.

As the day marked the completion of one year of the PML government, 
Mr Leghari while enumerating the present government's failures said: 
"The system is fast sinking under the weight of the so-called 
mandated system." Referring to the prevailing conditions in the 

country, he said: "We have the structures of democracy without 
having the spirit of democracy, we have the largest irrigation 
system with the lowest agricultural yield, we have developed the 
nuclear capability but have a very weak education base."

Deriding the PML government, Mr Leghari said nobody including 
himself had expected the kind of mandate the PML received in the 
general election of 1997. He said after receiving such an 
overwhelming mandate, there were no impediments in the way of 
delivering good governance.

The former president criticized Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for 
hungering for more power even after securing his position with the 
passage of the 13th Amendment. Referring to the government plans for 
radically amending the constitution, he said that before such a 
move, the people of the country should be taken into confidence and 
a public debate through the media should precede the amendments.

Continuing in the same vein, Mr Leghari said had the present rulers 
been clear in their aims the present situation in Karachi in the 
aftermath of a kidnapping of a girl and the PML-ANP tussle over 
renaming the NWFP would not have arisen.

"The government is only interested in promoting the interests of a 
family and friends of that family. Cronies and sycophants are being 
rewarded," he said.

On the economic front, he criticized the excessive "dollarization" 
of economy.

Referring to the present government's foreign policy, especially 
vis-a-vis India, he said: "Much more is required than one Punjabi 
prime minister thumping another Punjabi prime minister on the back."

Mr Leghari did not spare the Pakistan Peoples Party, whose 
leadership was thoroughly lambasted in his speech. He flayed the PPP 
for trying to divert the public attention from its wrongdoings and 
corruption by threatening to launch street agitation. The PPP and 
the PML, he said, were like a "mutual aid society". Both parties had 
garnered only 37 per cent of the popular vote in the last elections, 
he added.

After having built up a case against both the leading political 
parties of the country, Mr Leghari said a third alternative force of 
citizens, who are above parochial and other petty considerations was 
the only panacea for the ills afflicting the country.

Replying to a question, he said the most immediate threat to 
Pakistan was in the economic field. In this regard, he said, 
Karachi, the hub of commercial activity had suffered a great deal. 
"I think Karachi is still in trouble," he added.

Answering why after coming to power people assumed the permanent 
leadership of their respective political parties which left no 
opportunity for others to rise from the ranks, Mr Leghari said it 
was exactly this kind of permanent party leadership which gave rise 
to sycophancy resulting in not only damaging the party but hurting 
the country as well. He said it was unfortunate that the two 
successive prime ministers fell under the said category.

Decision on 23rd to defer or retain retail GST

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 18: While the National Assembly Committee on Finance 
says the traders are willing to pay the GST at retail level after 
some improvements in the system, a section of the trading community 
still rejects it in totality.

According to a press release of All Pakistan Organization of Small 
Traders and Cottage Industries, an "all Pakistan convention for GST 
rejection" will be held in Lahore on 20th (Friday), in which plans 
to go for a strike on 26th will be finalized.

However, the Chairman Standing Committee on Finance, Economic 
Affairs and Statistics, Sardar Mansoor Hayat Tamman said that the 
decision whether to defer the 3 per cent GST at retail level or 
maintain it, will be finalized in a meeting on 23rd in Islamabad 
between the traders and the government.

"I think the GST at retail level will be implemented as trade groups 
are willing to pay, provided its modalities and rules are 
simplified," he later told during a press briefing. He said the 
committee will deliberate on simplification of rules in Islamabad.

Meanwhile, in another move the Central Board of Revenue (CBR) has 
shown its inability to accede to the request of Karachi Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry (KCCI) regarding the extension of SRO 675(I) 
97 up to June 1998 for clearance of goods. The KCCI had sent a 
letter to the Finance Minister, Sartaj Aziz regarding abrupt 
withdrawal of SRO of August 1997.

In a meeting at the KCCI, MNA Mian Abdul Manan attributed the move 
as the worst example of the bureaucratic process, assuring the 
traders that the standing committee will take up the issue with the 
concerned authorities.

Sindh getting 20pc less water from Punjab, PA told
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 16: The Sindh is currently getting around 20 per cent 
less water than it usually gets downstream on the Indus River 
because the Taunsa Barrage in Punjab is damaged, the minister for 
irrigation and power told the Sindh Assembly on Monday.

This is also perhaps the first time that the government has publicly 
said that the Taunsa Barrage was damaged and that this was affecting 
the supply of irrigation water to Sindh.

The minister, Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi, in response to an adjournment 
motion by an opposition legislator demanding discussion on the 
shortage of irrigation water in Sindh, said that Sindh, under an 
agreement was to get 32,800 cusecs of water of water downstream on 
the Indus River but was getting only 26,000 cusecs because the 
Taunsa Barrage was damaged.

The adjournment motion of opposition MPA Abdus Sattar Bachani was 
moved in his absence by PPP MPA Syed Nasir Hussain Shah who said 
that the situation in Sindh for irrigation was so bad that there 
wasn't even enough water for the wheat crop which had recently been 
sown.

He said that t1,500 branches, minor branches and water courses had 
dried up, and three canals had closed because there wasn't enough 

water flowing downstream on the Indus.

The minister told the assembly that the Sindh government had 
approached the federal government on this matter and that the water 
would be available by February 22 from the Mangla reservoir via the 
Chashma Link Canal. PPP legislator Jam Saifullah Dharejo stood up at 
this point and said that according to a recent report the federal 
government had slashed Sindh's allocation for the Tameer-i-Sindh 
programme and was now holding back water which was vital for crop 
irrigation. The MPA said that this all seemed to suggest that the 
Punjab province was encroaching on the rights of the Sindh.

SC converts 'chargesheet' against PM into notice
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Feb 17: A supreme court bench headed by Chief Justice 
Ajmal Mian agreed on Tuesday to treat as a mere "show cause notice" 
a "chargesheet" issued to Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif by a 
bench headed by the former chief justice, Justice (retd) Sajjad Ali 
Shah, for alleged contempt of court.

Mr S.M. Zafar, counsel for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, took 90 
minutes to persuade the court that the chargesheet issued to the 
prime minister was not a chargesheet as required under the law, and 
the court was still at the stage of "show cause notice".

When the proceedings started on Tuesday, Chief Justice Ajmal Mian 
observed that the previous bench had chargesheeted the prime 
minister, and the only question for the court to decide was what 
procedure to follow.

Mr S.M. Zafar contended that no charge sheet had been "issued", but 
admitted that a chargesheet had been "drafted". He said unless a 
chargesheet was read out to an accused asking him whether he pleaded 
guilty or not guilty, there was no chargesheet.

He said under rule 7 of the 1976 Contempt of Court Act, the attorney 
general had to act as a prosecutor, and it was his duty to read out 
a charge to an accused. He said no such thing had happened in this 
case, and the so-called chargesheet was handed down to 
representatives of the respondents at the office of the deputy 
registrar.

When the chief justice observed that a mere formality of reading out 
a chargesheet to an alleged contemner was not performed, the counsel 
for the prime minister stated that reading out the chargesheet to 
the accused was not a "mere formality", but an "essential 
formality."

Mr Zafar argued that contempt proceedings against his client were at 
the stage of show cause notice, asking him to explain why contempt 
process should not be initiated. It was still open for the court to 
discharge the notice after getting the response from the respondent, 
he stated.

He read out an identical statement which he had read before the 
previous bench headed by Justice Sajjad Ali Shah on Nov 17.
Responding to newsmen's question was one of the responsibilities of 
the prime minister, and it fell within the right of freedom of 
expression and fair comment as guaranteed by Article 19, he said.


He said suspending the potency of the 14th Amendment through an 
interim order without hearing the Federal Government or the attorney 
general, had upset parliamentarians who raised the issue in the 
parliament and this necessitated an explanation by the respondent.

He contended that by virtue of section 8 of the Contempt of Court 
Act, Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah, after having taken cognizance, 
could not proceed with the case.

Mr S.M. Zafar read out a transcript of the Press talk of the prime 
minister in the parliament building. When he completed the reading, 
the court inquired whether he owned it or not. He owned it by saying 
that it was a transcript from PTV recording, and it was a true copy 
of what the prime minister had stated. He said Press reports were 
not accurate.

When the counsel for the prime minister insisted that it was a duty 
of the attorney general to frame charges, Chief Justice Ajmal Mian 
observed that in criminal matters, charges were always framed by the 
court. Contempt proceedings, he added, were quasi criminal.

The chief justice observed that there were two types of contempt 
proceedings: a) when contempt was brought to the notice of the court 
by an individual; (b) when the court took suo motu notice.

Justice Shaikh Riaz Ahmed observed the only requirement was that the 
alleged contemner should be informed of his alleged crime, and that 
requirement had been fulfilled in the case under consideration.

Kabul told of cut in transit trade list
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, Feb 14: Pakistan has decided to cut the number of items 
being imported under the Afghan Transit Trade Agreement, after the 
government suffered a loss of Rs5 billion in revenue due to 
smuggling of various items under the ATTA cover.

The decision was conveyed to the Afghan delegation members currently 
visiting Pakistan. They were told that the government had no option 
but to increase the number of items on the negative list to curb 
smuggling.

The ATTA, signed in March 1965, had bound Pakistan government to 
clear all imports made under the transit trade accord without 
interception.

It has been exactly two years after subjecting the ATTA-65 to the 
first negative list, that Kabul has been told that in view of 
certain scandalous violations detected recently, more items would be 
added to the negative list.

Dawn learned from the commerce ministry sources that the customs 
intelligence had indicated recently that consignments solely of 
sugar mills and flour mills had come ashore. On confirmation of 
these reports, the federal authorities attempted to intercept the 
consignments before they could be transported upcountry but in vain 
as the ATTA-65 had no provision for interception of such cargoes. 
This and other violations were listed and communicated to the 
relevant Afghan authorities and it was maintained that Pakistan had 
no other way of eliminating smuggling under ATTA but to extend the 

negative list to a number of items already notified.

The 17 items that the ministry of commerce had placed on the 
negative list in its notification No 2 (14)/92-Tr. 1, dated Feb 14, 
1996, include: cigars/cigarettes, tyres/ tubes, dyes and chemicals, 
yarn, PVC and PMC materials, polyester metalized film, black tea, 
refrigerators, televisions and parts thereof, ball-bearings, soaps 
and shampoos, auto parts of all sorts, timers/capacitors, vegetable 
ghee and cooking oil.

It may be pointed out here that for the past two years, not only had 
the Afghan authorities turned down Islamabad's repeated requests to 
put a ban on import of these items, they even termed imposition of 
the negative list as an encroachment on Afghanistan's sovereignty. 
This attitude has forced Pakistan to unilaterally revise the ATTA-65 
authorization, the ministry sources said.

In view of this situation, a commerce ministry communication last 
week to the CBR (now renamed Pakistan Revenue Service) requested re-
examining of the Afghan Transit Trade Agreement of March 2, 1965, 
without altering its fundamentals (as demanded by the Kabul 
government recently).

Reconstitution of PTV, PBC boards of directors urged
--------------------------------------------------------------------
By Our Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Feb 14: A citizens' media commission has urged the 
government to reconstitute the boards of directors and the PTV and 
PBC to end the monopoly of official members and bring in private 
citizens of acknowledged independence of mind and eminence.

These citizens, the commission said in its first seminar on 
"democratic governance and freedom of electronic media", presided 
over by its chairman, Justice Nasim Hasan Shah, here on Saturday, 
should be appointed after the concurrence of the leaders of the 
opposition in the Senate and the National Assembly. "While the 
government can continue to have representation on the boards, the 
majority must reflect a balanced, social presence," it stressed.

The "Citizens' Media Commission of Pakistan" has been established by 
a group of private citizens with the avowed objective of serving as 
an independent forum to conduct analyses from the public interest 
viewpoint of media-related laws, policies and issues, as well as to 
monitor the media content. Its first meeting coincided with the 
first anniversary of the promulgation this day in 1997 of the 
Electronic Media Regulatory Ordinance, 1997. Passed by the last 
caretaker government, the ordinance was allowed to lapse. The 
commission observed the day as "Electronic Media Freedom Day".

The meeting demanded that it should be the reconstituted boards of 
the PTV and PBC, and not the bureaucracy, that should have the power 
to appoint their chief executives on the basis of merit, integrity 
and independence of mind rather than on political considerations.

Other demands made by the commission were:
   
* Appropriate amendments to the PBC Act, 1973 should be initiated 

and discussed in the media before being introduced in the parliament 
to ensure effective autonomy for PBC rather than the present 
ceremonial autonomy.
    
* A draft of a new "PTV Act" should be prepared to create a 
legislative framework for PTV to ensure authentic autonomy for the 
Corporation.
    
* Government should reduce its share-holding in Shalimar Recording & 
Broadcasting Co. Ltd. from its present 56 per cent to a minority 
interest in order to enable SRBC to become a truly private and 
independent corporation.
    
* The ordinance which enables the operation of private radio and TV 
channels should be introduced to the parliament for adoption as an 
act to enable the establishment of an autonomous authority headed by 
a retired judge of the Supreme Court for the award of licences and 
permits for private radio and TV channels.
    
* As provided for in the ordinance, private monopolies in electronic 
media created through a non-transparent process should cease to 
remain monopolies or enjoy exclusivity. Instead, while allowing them 
to continue operation, the executive and monopolistic aspects of the 
licences given to them should be changed to make them competitive 
with new media.

Relief for 1981-95 ad hoc appointees 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent 

ISLAMABAD, Feb 18: The federal government on Wednesday said ad hoc 
employees recruited from 1981 to 1995 would continue getting 
salaries till a decision on their cases by the Federal Public 
Service Commission (FPSC).

The Establishment Division in a Press note on Wednesday stated the 
federal government had recently taken a decision to regularize 
services of ad hoc employees appointed during the aforesaid period.

To ensure that the process of regularization was transparent and 
conformed to a supreme court judgment requiring appointments on 
merit, the cases of ad hoc employees had been placed in two 
categories.

The first category comprised those employees who were fully 
qualified and recruited in accordance with the prescribed procedure, 
including invitation of applications through the Press and 
observance of provincial quotas. The FPSC will process such cases 
for recommendation in accordance with a procedure to be determined 
by it.

To the second category belonged those cases in which appointments 
were made in violation of the prescribed procedure regarding 
qualification, provincial quotas and invitation of applications 
through advertisement. Such appointees will appear along with fresh 
candidates before the FPSC for selection.

To enable those ad hoc appointees who had crossed the age limit to 
appear before the FPSC, the government would issue a notification 
for an amendment in the relevant SRO.

The establishment division stated that the government had conveyed 
its decision to the FPSC.

The division further stated that pending regularization of the ad 
hoc appointees, periodic extensions were being granted after every 

six months. The last extension was granted up to June 6 this year.

The establishment division dismissed reports that salaries of these 
employees had been stopped.

Proposal to raid Bara markets turned down
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ikram Hoti

ISLAMABAD, Feb 17: The interior ministry has expunged a proposal 
from the provincial anti-smuggling committees recently made through 
consensus, for raids on all the smuggled goods (Bara) markets in the 
country.

The proposal came, from the four provincial anti-smuggling 
committees recently formed in all the provincial capitals, for 
proposing ways and means for rooting out smuggling, after an 
exchange of views among themselves, ministry of commerce and the 
Central Board of Revenue.

Having formed the proposal through joint efforts, it was 
communicated to the ministry of interior, for clearance. The 
ministry was also asked for assistance for deputing the law 
enforcement contingents, which were meant to accompany the raiding 
ASC and customs officials, in all the four provinces.

The proposal was based on a thoroughly conducted survey of all the 
Bara markets, the routes used for transporting the smuggled goods, 
the names of owners of the shops, the quantities and nature of the 
goods being sold there.

The CBR examined the ways and means to meet the demand of the 
trading community to root out the scourge and arrived at the 
conclusion that it cannot be done without intermittent raids on the 
Bara markets.

The committees took about two months, first in examining the lists 
of items and the location of the Bara markets, and then of the ways 
and means suggested for taking practical steps. The ministry of 
commerce proposals for lowering the duty rates on the items listed, 
coincided this process.

The CBR responded by pleading that the duty rates had already been 
lowered beyond a sustainable limit, and the national exchequer could 
not afford losing another Rs 2-3 billion by taking the step. 
Referring to the ASC proposal, it suggested that assistance be 
sought from the ministry of interior, to assist the ASC and the 
customs authorities, for conducting raids.

New proposals for improving the performance of the Civil Armed 
Forces, which were reported to have miserably failed in stopping the 
traffic of smuggled goods into Pakistan via Pak-Afghan borders, were 
also made. Most of the goods is transported beyond the Durand Line 
after import through Afghan Transit Trade facility of duty 
exemption, and were re-smuggled into Pakistan.

Sources said the proposal on raids was sent to the ministry of 
interior and the response was awaited for about a month, whereas, 
the ASC and the CBR considered it a matter of priority, and were 
pressing for a positive response. The ministry of interior, at last 
responded in negative to the proposal, with remarks which were least 
expected.

The ministry told the ASC and the CBR that the need of the hour was 
to supervise the performance of the ASC by the four provincial chief 

ministers. The ministry mentioned a number of already applied 
methods for conducting such a supervision, and listed a couple of 
new methods. These relate to bettering the performance of the Civil 
Armed Forces along the Durand Line, and the performance of the 
provincial excise departments.

The proposal for assistance from the law enforcing agencies, to 
conduct raids on the Bara markets, has not been considered by the 
ministry as worth undertaking. The ministry did not even list the 
arguments in favour of its rejection of the proposal.

Private forex deposits within safe limit
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mohiuddin Aazim

KARACHI, Feb 19: The present level of private foreign currency 
deposits is safe enough to withstand any shocks, the National 
Assembly standing committee on finance and economic affairs was told 
by the State Bank on Thursday.
    
The committee was told during a briefing at the SBP that the private 
forex deposits totalled $9.8 billion early this month which posed no 
threats for the economy, said a source privy to the briefing.
    
He said the committee headed by Sardar Mansoor Hayat Tamman had 
shown some signs of concerns regarding dollarisation of the economy. 
"The committee was told that 70 per cent of private forex deposits 
were those against which loans had been issued," the source said. 
"The remaining 30 per cent are covered by the country's liquid and 
gold reserves."

The source said the committee was informed that out of the total 
private forex deposits of $9.8 billion, $2.0 billion related to 
forward cover purchased by the exporters that would keep flowing 
into the country's liquid forex reserves in parts.

Private forex deposits account for roughly 40 per cent of the total 
time and demand liabilities of the banks operating in Pakistan.
    
Another sources privy to the briefing said the committee also 
discussed the creation of excess liquidity in the banking system and 
its utilization. "The committee noted that more than Rs 140 billion 
worth of excess liquidity was available in the monetary system." The 
source said the committee expressed its desire that the excess 
liquidity be directed towards productive use.
    
He said the committee was informed that during the first seven 
months of the current fiscal year ending January lending to the 
private sector had risen to Rs 63.174 billion against Rs 56.701 
billion in 1996-97. "But the committee pointed out that the lending 
to private sector registered a really significant increase during 
the last two months," he said. "The committee noted that had there 
been an increase in private sector lending right from the beginning 
of the fiscal year it should have done more good to the economy. The 
source said the SBP official explained to the committee the reasons 
for uneven increase in lending to the private sector including 

seasonal variations in the demand for bank credit.
    
He said the committee was also explained the reasons for a huge Rs 
5.089 billion rise in credit to the public sector corporations 
during the first seven months of 1997-98 against a Rs 574 million 
contraction during the same period in 1996-97.

Second major gas discovery in Sindh
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Muhammad Ilyas

ISLAMABAD, Feb 14: A second major discovery of high quality gas in 
Sindh in as many weeks was announced here on Saturday.

Described as a breakthrough in efforts to reduce Pakistan's 
dependence on energy imports, the new discovery of oil as well as 
gas has been made by Oil & Gas Development Corporation (OGDC) in 
Tando Allah Yar which contains, according to tentative analysis, 
around two million stock tank barrels of oil and 38 billion cubic 
feet of gas.

It will be recalled that the Australian oil and chemicals group OMV 
had announced last week that its subsidiary, OMV (Pakistan) 
Exploration GmbH had struck gas at Sawan-1, the first exploration 
well drilled in the South West Miano exploration licence, which is 
situated in Khairpur district, Sindh.

At Tando Allah Yar-I, OGDC spudded the well on Nov 15 last over the 
area awarded to it in September, 1997 and drilled down to the depth 
of 1750 metres. The objective, according to the official source, was 
to test hydrocarbon potential of Lower Goru Formation (Upper sands) 
of cretaceous age. The drilling was completed last month.

During the test, the well flowed from two zones at a combined flow 
rate of 380 barrels of oil and 16 million cubic feet of gas per day. 
According to the details, the first zone flowed at 1/2 inch choke 
size, well pressure 1550 (PPSI) 290 barrels of oil and 7.6 (MCF) gas 
per day. In the second zone at 1/2 inch choke size, well pressure 
1700 (PPSI) oil flowed 90 barrels and gas 8.5 (MCF) per day. The 
well has been completed as a dual producer to produce from both 
zones.

The gas found has a calorific heating value of 874 BTU per cubic 
feet and with a composition of Methane and Ethane of 72.8%, Nitrogen 
13.4% and CO2 9.9%. There is no sulphur in the gas. OGDC plans to 
appraise the field through additional drilling in the area.

IMF asks govt to cut spendings
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Feb 20: The IMF has asked the government to cut its 
across the board expenditures to reduce budget deficit, and allow 
Corporations to raise tariffs with a view to improving their 
financial health.
    
Informed sources told Dawn here on Friday that the ongoing two weeks 
long negotiations with the visiting IMF mission headed by Antonio 
Furtado were likely to end by Sunday next after its crucial meeting 
with Minister for Finance Senator Sartaj Aziz.

    
The mission had held talks here on Friday again with the officials 
of the ministry of finance, Planning Division and the State Bank 
during which, it expressed concern as to why different targets 
related to GDP growth, revenue, exports and other fiscal issues were 
not met.
    
Sources said that the major thrust of the mission was that the 
government must reduce its expenditure on all accounts so that its 
budget deficit could be reduced and growing funding difficulties 
removed.
    
"The declining revenues and growing expenditure of the government is 
a matter of concern for the IMF", said a source in the multi-lateral 
agency. He told Dawn that the mission had completed the review of 
the Pakistani economy and would now meet the finance minister on 
Saturday or Sunday to conclude talks.
    
However, sources said that the five-member IMF mission called for 
urgently increasing power and gas charges to make WAPDA, KESC, Sui 
Southern and Sui Northern gas companies financially viable. They 
advised the government to take bold decisions without caring for the 
political consequences so that the economy of the country could be 
improved.
    
Sources said that 10 to 12 per cent increase in the electricity 
charges was very much on the card and would be announced shortly. 
The prime minister, sources said, has finally agreed to revise 
upward power tariffs to save WAPDA from total collapse.
    
Sources said that the visiting IMF mission had sought details about 
broad new budgetary projections for the year 1998-99 specially 
revenues, exports, deficit, growth, inflation and the status of 
various corporations. It wanted to know about those state-owned 
corporations which are likely to be privatized during  the  next 
financial year.  However,  it  expressed disappointment over the 
current pace of privatization and called for its acceleration. The 
sources said that the mission had advised the government to get rid 
of loss making industrial units as quickly as possible and forget 
about pumping money into them.
    
The officials, when contacted, said that talks with the IMF have 
been progressing well despite its reservations on some issues 
specially revenues and the poor performance of the corporations.  
They expressed the hope that Pakistan would qualify for the second 
tranche of 208 million dollars in March, out of 1.6 billion dollar 
ESAF/EFF.

NA body for review of NBP privatization decision
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 20: The chairman of National Assembly's standing 
committee on finance and economic affairs, Sardar Mansoor Hayat 
Tamman indicated on Friday that the committee would recommend to the 
government to review its decision of privatizing National Bank.
    
"If there was a categorical stand on this issue that should be 
rethought," he told a press conference after receiving a briefing by 
the NBP president Mohammedmian Soomro and other senior officials. 

Two of his colleagues Mr Ejaz Shaffi and Rana Tanvir Azhar frankly 
said they would like the NBP not to be privatized as they said it 
was the only well-performing state-run bank implying it should 
remain in the public sector.
    
"A final decision rests with the ECC (Economic Coordination 
Committee)," said Mr Tamman adding "the committee would make its 
recommendations on this issue." Earlier some press reports suggested 
that the government intends to put off the NBP privatization.
    
Mr Taman said the Bank has made a 100 per cent provisioning against 
its classified portfolio of Rs 31.886 billion and despite that has 
achieved what he called worthy financial results.
    
The committee was told that the capital base of NBP rose by 19.8 per 
cent to Rs 8.444 billion in 1997; its total assets grew by 5.5 per 
cent to Rs 390.5 billion; deposits increased by 8 per cent to Rs 
262.505 billion and gross advances swelled by 18.4 per cent to Rs 
131.848 billion.
    
The committee was further told that the gross profit of NBP 
increased by 13.4 per cent to Rs 4.9 billion in 1997 against Rs 
4.322 billion in 1996 adding that cash recoveries soared by 107.4 
per cent to Rs 2.759 billion in 1997 from Rs 1.33 billion in 1996.
    
Mr Tamman said the NBP management had told the committee there was 
not the slightest of window dressing in its balance sheet adding the 
committee warned them if any window dressing is detected later on 
the management would be taken to task.

Participation of local engg industry mandatory
--------------------------------------------------------------------
By Intikhab Hanif

LAHORE, Feb 18: The federal government has advised provinces to 
award turnkey contracts with full participation of local engineering 
industry with foreign manufacturers/contractors. 

According to the new strategy contained in a directive of the Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif seeking immediate and strict compliance, 
turnkey contracts should not be allowed, ordinarily, to the foreign 
manufacturers/contractors. 

Instead, sources said quantified efforts will be made to fully 
associate local engineering industry with the foreign 
manufacturers/contractors for achieving optimal import substitution 
and indigenization. 

The concept of EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) will 
be promoted for award of contracts to local manufacturers/suppliers 
with or without any consortium arrangements with foreign technology 
partners, the directive said. 

Regarding public sector organizations, the directive said, they will 
place orders to meet their requirements of capital goods on local 
manufacturers/suppliers in public sector on negotiation basis in 
case of a single source and if international financing is not 
involved. 

Public sector will ensure that the specifications of all supplies 
and services for major industrial and infrastructure projects be 
designed and tailored in a manner that the use of locally 
manufacturers goods, as per CGO 17/94, is fully ensured. 


The tender conditions in such cases will make provision for 
acceptance of alternate or substitute goods which are produced 
locally of international standards. 

Provisions of SRO 1083(1)83 will be complied with by all public 
sector organizations and the National Council for the Engineering 
and Industrial Coordination will monitor the progress of the 
directive, and intervene, whenever necessary, to ensure 
implementation, the directive said. 

In Punjab, the directive was circulated among all administrative 
secretaries, divisional commissioners and heads of autonomous bodies 
for compliance on Wednesday.

US firm gets patent to market Basmati
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaheen Sehbai

WASHINGTON, Feb 17: While Pakistan produces and exports the best 
basmati rice in the world, an American company has obtained the 
patent to market its product in US and internationally under the 
name of "Basmati Rice".

Surprisingly as Pakistanis are so far silent on the development, 
probably not even aware of it, the Indians are mounting a legal 
challenge to capture the patent, in what could turn out to be a long 
drawn rice war.

"If Pakistanis want to remain in the rice market worldwide, they 
will have to quickly prepare their legal case and start fighting," a 
seasoned businessman said.

India hopes that the US government will withdraw a patent issued to 
a US company for Basmati rice as "there are enough records to prove 
that the rice is typically Indian," the Indian Ambassador said at a 
Press talk with Indian journalists.

While both US and India are either wholly or partially irrelevant to 
the subject, the party which should have been the most active and 
worried, the rice exporters of Pakistan and the official Export 
Promotion Bureau, are intriguingly quiet and doing nothing.

The Indian Ambassador said India was preparing the necessary 
documentation to rebut the company's claim. "It is basically a case 
of going over the legal procedures to correct (a mistake by the US 
patent office)," Ramesh Chandra said. The US firm, Ricetec, which 
currently markets its product under the name 'Texmati,' is claiming 
that its strain of crossed rice is "similar to or even superior to 
good quality Basmati rice."

The Indians are claiming that the US company does not claim that its 
product is "Basmati rice", which they claim is grown in a particular 
area of Dehra Dun district in Uttar Pradesh.

Chandra said the claim advanced by the company was a misuse of the 
process of patenting.

Ricetec has already been trying to stake a claim in the 
international Basmati market with brands like 'Kasmati' and 
'Texmati', which claim to be "basmati-type" rice.

However, Ricetec will now be able to not only call its aromatic rice 
'Basmati' within the US, but also sell all its rice exports under 
the name of Basmati rice.

The Indians say the grant of patent to the US firm will result in 
India losing out on the 45,000-tonne US market, which forms 10 per 

cent of the total basmati exports. Its premium position in vital 
markets like the European Union, the UK and West Asia will also be 
affected.

The Pakistanis are yet to enter the legal or even the public 
relationing battle to stake a claim.

India Press reports say stunned by the development, the commerce 
ministry, the APEDA, the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, and 
the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, and the Basmati 
industry have together decided to immediately challenge the patent 
given to Ricetec by the US government.

PTCL's after tax profit boosts stocks
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Staff Reporter

KARACHI, Feb 20: Stocks on Friday showed firm trend, boosted largely 
by PTCL's above market expectations after tax profit of Rs 7.56 
billion for the half year ended December 31, 1997.
    
Although its board of directors, which met on February 20, did not 
declare any interim dividend, the market perception of an enhanced 
final triggered buystops in its share, currently ruling well below 
its best level.
    
"An increase of about 15 per cent in interim posttax profit is a 
handsome return and investors welcomed it in that spirit," said a 
broker.
    
The market has been ruling directionless for the last several weeks 
but analysts believe investors might not treat it as they did with 
Hub-Power, which came out with a good interim dividend of 70 per 
cent some two weeks back.
    
There are several reasons behind this perception as the market size 
and shareholding of the PTCL is much bigger than Hub-Power and added 
to extensive foreign stake, they added.
    
"The share of PTCL, which has been under pressure for the last 
couple of sessions owing to conflicting reports about its interim 
earning, rebounded after its board meeting announced above market 
expectations profit," analysts said. But the board did not declare 
any interim payout.
    
An interim earnings at Rs 23 billion show an improvement of over 14 
per cent over the last year's comparable figures and there are 
reasons to believe that the final might be much higher. Last year 
its management declared a cash dividend of 17.5 per cent.
    
The market has been expecting an interim aftertax profit of around 
Rs 6 billion to Rs 6.5 billion but it soared to Rs 7.65 billion
    
It was last quoted at Rs 34.20, up Rs 1.45 on a massive activity of 
28 million shares.
    
"Being a highly capitalized share and having a weightage of 32 per 
cent in the KSE 100-share index, the PTCL is capable of taking the 
entire market along with it where it wants to," said a leading floor 
broker.
    
The market has been under tremendous pressure owing partly to 
political twists and partly to adverse comments on the Karachi law 
and order situation and positive news from the PTCL provided the 
much-needed breather to it, he added.

IMF insists on urgent hike in power rates
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Feb 16: The visiting five-member IMF mission, headed by 
Fund's senior director Antonio Furtado, has advised the government 
to immediately increase electricity charges to save WAPDA from total 
collapse.

Informed sources told Dawn that the IMF mission had a detailed 
meeting with Deputy Chairman Planning Commission Dr Hafeez Pasha and 
other senior officials of the ministry of finance here on Monday 
during which the IMF team members advised them to revise upward 
power tariffs to help WAPDA tide over the acute financial straits.

The sources said that the IMF mission endorsed the contention of 
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz and Water and Power Minister Raja Nadir 
Pervaiz that power charges should be increased. Both the ministers 
had proposed to the prime minister to allow an increase of 10 to 12 
per cent in power charges.

Dr Pasha told Dawn that talks held with the IMF mission on Monday 
mainly focussed on WAPDA during which various options to pull the 
organisation out of the financial predicament were discussed.

Dr Pasha said the Fund members were apprised of WAPDA's financial 
position and its deficit and added that the government was examining 
various probabilities for making WAPDA an efficient and profit-
making organisation.

Responding to a question Dr Pasha said that policy-level discussions 
with the IMF team concluded on Monday and discussions on major 
issues covered under the Extended Structural Adjustment Facility 
(ESAF) would begin on Tuesday.

To another question he said revenue shortfalls, GDP growth, budget 
deficit, balance of payment position, inflation etc. would come up 
for discussion during Tuesday's meeting.

The sources said that the IMF mission called for curtailing 
government expenditures. Revenue slippages, decline in exports and 
steps to increase foreign exchange reserves were also discussed.

The IMF mission, however, appreciated government's efforts to reduce 
the current account deficit from $4 billion to $2 billion.

The sources said that the IMF mission also called for accelerating 
the pace of privatisation. It inquired as to why the government was 
unable to disinvest nationalised commercial banks (NCBs) and 
development financial institutions (DFIs) by March 30 this year.

Ardeshir Cowasjee

WHILST flying to Islamabad last November a well-dressed well- 
mannered man sitting besides me greeted me with a 'Salaam alaikum.' 
I responded with an 'Alaikum assalaam' and enquired if he was a 
Pakistani. He answered with a "Thank God, no", and introduced 
himself as Daud Bokhary, a former officer of the British-Indian army 
who had settled in Hong Kong and had been doing business there for 
fifty years.

A successful stockbroker, he had just retired and handed the 
business over to one of his sons. "I hope my son will follow my 
principles," he said, "for, as the old saying goes, 'loss of gold is 
much, loss of time is more, loss of honour is such that nothing can 
restore it'."

Another son, Hong Kong-born Kamal Bokhary, just turned fifty, read 
law in England, was admitted to the Hong Kong Bar in 1971 and in 
1984 became a Queen's Counsel. He was appointed a judge of the court 
of appeal in 1993, and on July 1, 1997, at the Hong Kong hand-over, 
had been elevated to the court of final appeal which on that date 
replaced the British Privy Council.

He was proud of his family's achievements, remarking how it is that 
whenever Pakistanis go abroad to settle and do business they do 
exceedingly well, as he had done. But in their own country they are 
non-achievers for want of good government, honest government, and an 
atmosphere conducive to hard work. They are weighted down by leaders 
unable to set any sort of example, by discriminatory laws, and by 
ever-increasing corruption.

Bokhary was visiting Pakistan to attend an investment conference 
organized by the government. "Are you investing in Pakistan?" I 
enquired. With astonishment bordering on anger he replied, "Having 
conversed with me for an hour, do you really take me to be such a 
damned fool? The Pakistan consul-general in HK, a friend, had to be 
supported."

At the Islamabad airport Bokhary was met by a green-blazered 
government PR man and taken off with two others who were to attend 
the conference and had arrived on the same flight. Waiting to 
collect my baggage, I was accosted by another green-blazer and asked 
whether I was conference-bound Mr McDuff of McGregor & McGregor. I 
was asked the same question in the space of ten minutes by two more 

searching green-blazers who were trying to locate the fourth member 
they were sent to collect. It seemed that Mcduff had just not taken 
off. The dour Scots value money and time.

What the prime minister and his underlings must realize is that they 
totally lack credibility, and merely rounding up a herd of bakras 
can do us no good.

Moving on to the prime minister's nationally televised conference of 
January 20, where some 200 businessmen and chief executives of the 
banking, trade, commerce and industry sectors, both national and 
multi-national, had been summoned to form the private sector 
advisory council (PSAC) for investment. Many of those attending 
were, in the words of a Lahore daily, "in the forefront of the 
outstanding Rs. 140 billion bank loans default." The leading 
defaulters complained that they were not being given further loans 
at low interest rates. Governor Yaqub of the State Bank was asked to 
respond. He did, giving cogent fiscal reasons which the prime 
minister could not comprehend. Playing to the gallery, Nawaz Sharif 
derided him, which compelled him to hand in his resignation, which 
in turn has further destabilized us.

It is a matter of deep regret that there were many Pakistani head 
honchos (some of them kala sahibs) in the audience capable of 
understanding and appreciating the governor's stance, yet not one 
rose to speak up in his defence. When Nawaz Sharif invited Tom 
Higgins, the head of Shell, to rise and speak, he was forthright and 
to the point. He was the only man who had the guts to support 
Governor Yaqub. What does this tell us about our own countrymen who 
held their peace? Frightened and silent, can they do us any good? 
But our press has spoken. Editors and columnists have written loud 
and long. Why is a man capable of standing up against wrong being 
sacrificed for expediency? Why is he not being allowed to complete 
his second term ending in 2001?

Nawaz Sharif would fare well if he were induced to read the February 
10 editorial in The Times (London), 'Honest banker  Eddie George 
should be appointed for a second term', concerning the governor of 
the Bank of England, which Tony Blair has read and understood. "Mr 
George has done a generally good job, contributing as much as 
anybody to the healthy condition of the British economy today. 
Within the framework set by the new Government, Mr George has 
performed competently... The reprehensible arguments against Mr 
George relate to his political independence... When it comes to 
political independence, Mr George stands guilty as charged... The 
questions that the Prime Minister and chancellor must now answer are 
simple. Do they want the Bank run by a man with a good professional 
reputation, a realistic view about EMU and a strong record of 
putting statutory duties above short-term political calculations? 
Were they serious about wanting a non-political monetary policy 
designed to keep inflation permanently under control or was the 
decision to give independence to the Bank of England just a short-
term political wheeze? Do they want a yesman who will turn the Bank 
into an arm of the Government's public relations and re-election 

machine? When the Government announces its decision, the financial 
markets and the voters will be entitled to draw some clear 
conclusions."

A copy of this editorial has been sent to Nawaz Sharif's law 
minister who maintains that he seldom reads our newspapers. This 
being so, he may not be in touch with public opinion.

Reverting to the tall Britisher who stood up and spoke, Tom Higgins 
has been in Pakistan for five years, over which period I have sat 
with him as a fellow director of Pakistan Refinery. There has not 
been one occasion when one could fault his views on business, wonky 
government policies, and investments in his host country. He is a 
trained economist, did his PPE at Oxford, and is willing to meet the 
prime minister, one-to-one, and tell him what he finds to be right 
and wrong. Nawaz Sharif would do well to call and hear him. He can 
tell him how those who have invested in the oil exploration and 
industry, and other investors, have suffered. As the past president 
of the Overseas Chamber of Commerce and Industry he has heard and 
knows enough.

At Davos, to which conference the prime minister was accompanied by 
a plane-load of ballast, he must surely have realized that 
Transparency International is not to be treated as a joke. TI's 
Chairman, Peter Eigen, was invited as a member of the panel that 
discussed "international corruption." During the discussion, Benazir 
Bhutto and Asif Zardari figured prominently, marginally ahead of the 
Marcos clan and the Mobutus. According to TI's 1997 rating, Pakistan 
still ranks amongst the first three most corrupt nations of the 
world. May 1 suggest that the prime minister discuss Davos with 
Ikram Seghal, the only Pakistani private entrepreneur who went to 
Davos this year at his own expense.

>From Davos, the plane-load of ballasts proceeded to London for a 
shopping spree. Whilst the shops were shut, an investment promotion 
conference was held where Nawaz Sharif spoke. Our professional 
conference organizers had arranged for a select group of fifteen 
potential investors to meet Nawaz sharif over lunch. In true 
Pakistani style, it was infiltrated by some 50 gatecrashing hangers-
on, including Nawaz Sharif's son, and no serious discussion took 
place.

On their return to Pakistan, came the 2010 conference held on 
February 10. The cottage-industrialists who were rounded up to fill 
the galleries were party street-strongmen. Nawaz Sharif showed up 75 
minutes late. The speakers were programmed to tow the line in 
approbation of the investment policies, amongst them a defaulter who 
has skimmed the country's banks and financial institutions of over 
Rs. 1 billion, the man who had won Benazir Bhutto's favour in her 
first round by arranging to confer upon her an honorary doctorate 
from a non-existent university.

Editors and columnists, barring those bribed by the government, who 
are inimical to those in power  to their ways, their arrogance, 
their corruption, the manner in which they live and lord it over us 
at our expense  are neither enemies of the state nor of its people. 
They fear spiralling prices, food and water riots, anarchy. 

"Hundreds rioted in an Indonesian town on Thursday as President 
Suharto ordered his military to be prepared to deal with mass unrest 
and moved to shore up control of the armed forces. Mobs enraged by 
soaring prices of basic goods rampaged..." (Dawn, Feb 13).

Nice work if you can get it...
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

IT may seem like sour grapes, but the spate of recent multi- million 
rupee appointments in the public sector has left me wondering 
whether I chose the right time to move into the private sector after 
30 years of government service.
    
On the other hand, it is people from the private sector who are 
hitting the jackpot, so maybe I can do a sort of lateral re- entry 
back to the government on a juicy contract. The sad truth is that 
career civil servants will continue to be paid a pittance while 
their counterparts will command extraordinarily high salaries for 
accepting official appointments.
    
Currently, a joint secretary in the federal secretariat has a 
monthly take-home pay of around Rs 17,000; if he is lucky, he will 
also have government housing, although there is a long waiting list. 
He is not entitled to official transport for private use, and 
although he has a few perks like a free residential telephone 
(subject to a ceiling), he leads a pretty hand-to-mouth existence, 
despite the fact that typically, he has around twenty years of 
service behind him. And contrary to popular perception, most civil 
servants in Islamabad have very few opportunities for bribes.
    
To add to his difficulties, the capital is Pakistan's most expensive 
city, and public transport is virtually non-existent. Given the 
terrible state of public education, he sends his children to private 
schools; and given the nature of his job, he has to dress reasonably 
well. Small wonder that financial worries prey constantly on his 
mind.
    
And this is the reality for the senior echelons of the federal 
bureaucracy; imagine what things are like for section officers and 
office assistants. To expect efficiency and high performance from 
them after underpaying them so grossly is unrealistic. obviously, 
the situation changes in the field: an assistant collector of 
Customs in grade 17 in the field probably makes several times in 
bribes what the member (customs) in the Central Board of Revenue 
draws as salary, despite the fact that he is in grade 21. As a 
consequence, there is a large built-in gap between the incomes of 
secretariat staff and those in the field. Now the government has 
accentuated these distortions and added to the frustration of 
Islamabad-based civil servants by creating a new class of public 
functionaries drawing private sector salaries. Indeed, some of these 
salary packages are positively obscene: apparently, the new chairman 
of the CBR is getting Rs 1.75 million per month plus perks which 
include a hundred-thousand rupee house, medical treatment for him 
and his family abroad, and an annual educational allowance of 

$10,000 each for his children. The total package works out to around 
2 million rupees a month, which translates into over half a million 
dollars a year. Not too many top executives abroad get this kind of 
remuneration.
    
Now, apart from a pang of pure envy, I have no quarrel with somebody 
making this kind of money. But when my taxes are being arbitrarily 
distributed in this fashion, I feel I have the right to raise an 
eyebrow. But more important than objections over this profligacy, 
there is the whole larger question of a class-based civil service. 
What are these huge disparities doing to morale? I know if I were 
still in government service and working in the secretariat, I would 
feel mightily aggrieved if somebody parachuted in from the private 
sector and was given a hundred times what I was getting for 
basically doing the same work.
    
I am quite willing to accept that the new CBR boss is a very 
effective manager; but the point to remember is that he will have to 
work through the same bureaucratic structure that his unsuccessful 
predecessor did. No matter how intelligent and hard working he is, 
he is bound to face resentment and a lack of cooperation from the 
rank and file. In addition to his own expensive presence, he is also 
bringing in six outsiders, again at very generous private sector 
salaries. We will now have these new contract members working side 
by side with career revenue officers who are getting a fraction of 
their new colleagues' salaries, despite the fact that they have 
years of experience.
    
Unfortunately, this new scheme will do nothing to curb the massive 
corruption that has virtually brought our tax-collecting machinery 
to a grinding halt. Quite the contrary: officers may well feel that 
they are justified in ripping off the exchequer because they are so 
underpaid when compared to the CBR chief and his merry men. The 
whole exercise was sardonically depicted by a recent cartoon in a 
Lahore daily: a man is replacing the CBR sign with a PRS (Pakistan 
Revenue Service) sign; the caption reads: "Revolutionary Changes In 
Tax-Collection System."
    
Another appointment to raise eyebrows and hackles is that of the 
federal education secretary. This gentleman, previously a little 
known associate professor at a private business management 
university in Lahore, has suddenly been given a contract and a 
reported salary of Rs 1.6 million. According to various newspapers, 
his true qualification is that he is related to the country's first 
family. But even if he had extraordinary abilities, the fact is that 
he could do very little to rescue our public education from its 
state of collapse. Education is a provincial subject and the federal 
government has a very small role, apart from monitoring the 
situation. True, there are innumerable organizations nobody has 
heard of that are attached to the federal education ministry, but 
its actual role is marginal at best. So how the new secretary will 
make any difference to anything is unclear.
    
In the seventies, there was a lateral entry scheme whereby people 
from the private sector joined government service at higher levels. 

However, they did so on the existing civil service salary structure. 
In the United States, there is a long tradition of top private 
sector executives joining the government at the highest level for 
the tenure of an administration; but here, too, they accept a 
drastic reduction in their salaries. They do so because they 
consider that they are compensated by the status and power their new 
jobs give them. Also, there is a long history of public service in 
America that is sadly lacking here.
    
What we are seeing in Pakistan today is a raid by a bunch of 
carpetbaggers who are in it only for the money. Nawaz Sharif needs 
to realize that there are no quick fixes if he wants to reform the 
system. Basically, state functionaries have to be paid a decent 
salary before we can demand that they perform at a certain level. By 
all means trim the bureaucracy, and close down the vast number of 
departments that have proliferated. But all this takes political 
will, something in short supply with this government.
    
Meanwhile, until somebody with some spine shows up to tackle this 
and other problems, we will just have to muddle along while the few 
lateral entrants will thrive. As the song in the musical "Crazy For 
You" goes: "Nice work if you can get it, and you can get it if you 
try."

Promise and performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Shaikh Manzoor Ahmad

THE golden jubilee year of our independence ended just a few weeks 
ago but its trail of turbulence has left us in anything but a 
celebratory frame of mind. Most intellectually aware Pakistanis 
consider it an eminently forgettable year because of rapid 
deterioration of law and order, coupled with terrorist violence, 
soaring unemployment, severe stagflation, general administrative 
collapse and massive corruption.
    
And, to cap it all, there were open conflicts among some of the 
highest state functionaries, leading to premature exit of President 
Leghari as well as CJ Sajjad Ali Shah amidst an intra- judiciary 
split in the supreme court. On the other hand, for some others like 
PM Nawaz Sharif, President Tarrar, and all their cohorts, things 
could not have turned out any better and it proved to be an 
unforgettably glorious year.
    
The most haunting memories of 1997 we carry with us into the new 
year are those of the TV footage of storming / ransacking of the 
country's apex court by a frenzied mob of ruling party goons. This 
was indeed a new low in our sordid political culture and has, quite 
justifiably, earned us worldwide scorn. After such a traumatic year, 
one felt entitled to hope for a somewhat more placid 1998; but, that 
alas was not to be.
    
We made a spectacularly inauspicious start to the new year with the 
Mominpura (Lahore) massacre of January 11 when about 75 persons, out 
of nearly 1,000 attending a religious majlis at a graveyard, were 
mowed down (25 killed) within a few minutes in broad daylight and 
without any provocation whatsoever by three or four terrorists who 

arrived in a stolen vehicle and departed the same way, after 
completing their heinous sectarian mission.
    
The perpetrators of this carnage, as of innumerable others over the 
past several years, remain untraced even though the usual charade of 
fearsome rhetoric by the PM/CM ordering the police and other 
concerned officials to nab the culprits within three days was duly 
enacted. A follow-up public statement affirming very strongly that  
"terrorists qanoon ke grift se naheen buch saghenge" was also 
routinely issued by the same VVIPS to assuage seething public anger 
immediately after the occurrence of this horrific crime. Of course, 
the ever elusive "qanoon's grift" is nowhere in sight so far, much 
to the comfort of all terrorists who naturally feel greatly 
emboldened to repeat their crimes with great frequency. The rituals 
of tough talk, coupled with the setting up of special investigating 
teams etc., no longer carry any credibility with the long suffering 
people, who have very little faith in the government  any 
government  and its myriad agencies.
    
Pakistan appears to have become a safe international haven for 
terrorists of all hues and colours as so many of them have been able 
to operate in and from our country for several years now, quite 
freely and fearlessly, without ever being caught / punished. Karachi 
was totally at the mercy of terrorists during the Jam Sadiq era and 
it was only after General Babar's highly successful crackdown on 
terrorists that peace was restored to this city. Unfortunately, 
Karachi is once again slipping into unbridled terrorism, which is 
creating an acute sense of insecurity in the general public.
    
The recently enacted anti-terrorist law seems to be proving much 
less effective than expected as the heavily armed terrorist militias 
appear to have succeeded in intimidating both the trial judges and 
the police into avoiding any decisive action against them. The 
police reportedly go to great lengths to submit weak challans while 
the trial judges try to prolong the proceedings inordinately so as 
to delay decisions as long as possible. The entire purpose of 
setting up the anti-terrorist courts will be defeated if the 
government fails to take very strong action to overcome this 
situation.
    
Entrusting the task of eliminating terrorist menace to the armed 
forces appears to be the only viable option in the present 
circumstances. A terrorism-free society is vital not only to our 
socio-economic health but also to our very survival as a nation of 
some consequence. We cannot possibly allow our country to become 
another Afghanistan or Algeria.
    
The country's economy  the most important plank of Mian Sahib's 
manifesto  is another dismal story. It continues, after full one 
year of the incumbent government's rule, to be in a comatose state 
and the much trumpeted seven "revival packages" have flopped badly. 
While the many incentives offered by the 'business friendly' 
government have been greedily grabbed, the beneficiary 
industrialists and businessmen have shown no inclination whatsoever 
to keep their side of the bargain by paying up their taxes and other 

government dues, which every responsible citizen is expected to do 
even without any special incentives.
    
The total revenue collected during the first half of the current 
financial year (CFY 1997-98) fell, as indicated in the State Bank's 
official report for the second quarter, short of the target of Rs 
148 billion by a hefty Rs 13.5 billion. Even more alarmingly, this 
revenue collection is 2.4% less than that for the same period last 
year (July-December '96), which was described by the then government 
itself as the worst ever in the economic history of Pakistan. This, 
then, is the state of affairs in spite of the fact that the windfall 
profits resulting from a steep fall in the international prices of 
oil during the last six months have been retained by the government, 
contrary to the agreement signed with the IMF, instead of passing on 
the benefit to the consumers.

Bilateralism is not the option
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Mushtaq Ahmad

WHILE public opinion in Pakistan will appreciate the wisdom of Mian 
Nawaz Sharif in refraining from the resumption of talks with the 
present government of India in the prevailing state of uncertainty, 
few will subscribe to his optimism about their prospects with the 
successor government.
    
Experience is a great teacher from which Pakistan has a great many 
things to learn. In the field of diplomacy the nastiest things are 
done in the nicest way. Some nations excel in this art. We, on the 
other hand, are too straight forward and outspoken to be adept in a 
technique that demands an extraordinary degree of flexibility of 
conscience and cleverness of mind.
    
Sophistication and hypocrisy which conceal standards behind their 
facade duplicity and double dealing are not in our grain. We call a 
spade a spade and the Indians call a kitchen knife a bread knife. 
There are diplomats naive enough to believe them. That we have not 
yet found out the truth about these lies is our misfortune. The 
essential goodness of human nature reflected in the confession of 
wrongs men commit is invariably missing from the practice of 
statecraft where 'my country  right or wrong' is the golden rule. 
India has unerringly followed that rule. We have yet to comprehend 
that in dealing with Pakistan. India's traditional strategy is to 
buy time in the hope that with its passage the issues that plague 
their relations will die out and become part of forgotten history.
    
India has been nursing this illusion ever since the two countries 
attained their independence totally forgetful of the disastrous 
consequences of the havoc unsettled disputes can cause between 
nations. Nations who are wronged never forgive the wrongdoers. If 
individuals do not forgive the confiscation of their properties even 
by their relations, how can countries be expected to condone the 
forcible occupation of their territory and the enslavement of its 
population. The Saar dispute between France and Germany and the 

Sudetanland between Germany and Czechoslovakia are matters of recent 
memory and we are still living with their aftermath. Going back into 
history, it had taken thirty years of armed conflict between the 
authority of the Universal Empire of the Church and the assertion of 
national sovereignty of the states, to be settled. India and 
Pakistan have been embattled in a cold war for fifty years and 
fought three wars for the dispute over the future of Kashmir.
    
Will the new rulers of India be more responsive to the demands of 
peace in the subcontinent is a question impossible to answer in the 
affirmative. All the preceding governments regardless of their 
political complexions and the personalities who have governed the 
country, have followed a policy of no compromise with Pakistan, 
notwithstanding their secular professions and loudly proclaimed 
peaceful disposition. 
    
Even a leader of Pandit Nehru's humanitarian outlook who had given 
the United Nations an undertaking to abide by its resolutions to 
hold a plebiscite in the state under international supervision had 
gone back on his word to retain his leadership image by the 
appeasement of public opinion in support of the incorporation of the 
state in the Indian Union.
    
Whether urged by the inner compulsions of power or national prestige 
with which it was intimately linked, Nehru had one of his closest 
friends and lieutenants, Sheikh Abdullah, who was by no means 
favourably disposed towards Pakistan, imprisoned and incarcerated in 
jail for several years for demanding the right of the people of 
Kashmir to self-determination, and his son, Farooq Abdullah, has now 
been rewarded with the chief ministership of the state for denying 
them that right and assisting the government of India in suppressing 
the freedom struggle.
    
The prospects of a settlement were never bright then and now seem 
more bleak than ever before. The bellicose mood of the country and 
the intolerant temper of the people symbolized in the upsurge of an 
aggressive nationalism does not augur well for the future of Indo-
Pak relations. The experience of the past has convincingly 
demonstrated the futility of achieving a reasonably acceptable 
solution through negotiations in the future. Their story of unending 
series has no precedent in the annals of diplomacy. A cold war 
punctuated by countless number of talks at the ministerial and 
secretarial level and between the highest functionaries of the state 
has produced no encouraging response, nor is it likely to produce it 
so long as might is allowed to have precedence over right.
    
Ideologue of the Bharatiya Janata Party has made no secret of their 
intentions to annul the partition. That the party's chances at the 
polls are bright even the leaders of the United Front and Congress 
seem to admit. How far and by what margin it will succeed in 
achieving its objective it will not take long to reveal.
    
New Delhi has made it known to the international community that it 
would not let the people of the state exercise their right of self-
determination in defiance of its own commitment to the United 

Nations in the face of the untold sufferings of the people in terms 
of the physical insecurity and economic deprivation. The communal 
carnage had imperilled their constitutionally guaranteed rights to 
life and property throwing their legal sanctity to the winds. For 
the victims of the tragedy that keeps on repeating itself at 
periodic intervals, the courts can provide no remedy even if they 
desire to do so. We have no system of collective fines or collective 
punishment to which only an alien government could resort when 
pressed by the gravity of the situation it was unable to control 
through normal procedures and practices of law. Now that the power 
conscious majority takes law into its own hands the administrative 
machinery and the judicial authorities retire from the scene.

Unlikely comradeship
--------------------------------------------------------------------
M.H. Askari

IT is difficult to visualise any two other parties more unlike each 
other than the Chinese Communist Party and the Pakistan Muslim 
League (Nawaz group), with virtually having nothing in common as 
regards their composition, constitution, leadership style or 
political strategy.

Yet, during the prime minister's visit to Beijing there were reports 
of the two parties having decided to "to learn from each other's 
experiences through the exchange of party workers." The arrangement 
was negotiated from the Pakistani side by the former bureaucrat, 
Sartaj Aziz, now the PML's secretary-general, and Shaikh Rashid 
Ahmad. The Chinese side was represented by the chief of the 
Communist Party's international division, Dai Binguo, and his 
deputy.

What the average Chinese Communist Party worker, who spends a great 
deal of his time in doing party work at grass roots level before 
being assigned any position of responsibility, can possibly learn 
from a Muslim League worker, who tends to regard himself a 
privileged person merely because he generally occupies a prominent 
position in the reception line on the eve of prime minister's 
arrival and departure in a party constituency, is difficult to 
understand.

Quite incredibly, Mr Sartaj Aziz, at the end of his discussions with 
Dai Binguo, reportedly said: "They (the Chinese party workers) will 
learn from our experience of working in a multiparty system and we 
will benefit from their training methods for producing disciplined 
party workers." Surely, the PML secretary-general is aware that 
there is not even the semblance of a multiparty system that can 
function under a Communist setup and that the so-called Muslim 
League worker in Pakistan enjoys the position that he does largely 
because of his connections with the feudal or baradari system.

In Pakistan there is a tendency among the political party workers 
belonging to the rural areas to try to get into urban centres, as 
close as possible to the wielders of state authority. In China, 
particularly as a result of the cultural revolution launched by 

Chairman Mao in 1969-70, party workers are supposed to concentrate 
on the rural areas and involve themselves with party organizational 
work there. In 1971, when the eminent China specialist, Edgar Snow, 
returned to Beijing, he found that about 80 per cent of the party 
cadres from the capital had been sent to rural centres known as 'May 
Seventh schools' described by Snow as "reform schools for 
reformers", where the inmates were required to integrate themselves 
with the masses and learn from the peasants and workers.

As was explained to Snow by the Communist Party leaders, party 
cadres had been extensively purged with the onset of the cultural 
revolution and they were sent down to the rural areas to go through 
a process of "struggle-criticism-transformation" before being 
reabsorbed into the cadres at the grass roots level. Even senior-
level Muslim League workers in Pakistan regard serving their rural 
constituencies as something of a punishment.

In the formative phase, in Communist China there was virtually no 
distinction between the army (which was to fight on two fronts  
against the Kuomintang and against Japan), and the party cadres. It 
was even difficult to make a distinction between a party office-
bearer and a soldier and Mao continued to treat the army as "the 
great training school" for the people. In Pakistan, no political 
party has been able to treat the army in a similar fashion. The army 
has always been a professional service and is treated as such with 
due deference by the political parties office-bearers even at the 
highest level.

Founded in 1921, the Chinese Communist Party at its ninth national 
Congress in April 1969 adopted a new constitution which 
unequivocally declared in its preamble that the party was "the 
political party of the proletariat." The Muslim League has never 
ceased to be a party of the feudal and baradari elite. Founded in 
1906 after a delegation of about 70 prominent Muslims led by the Aga 
Khan called on Viceroy Lord Minto in Simla, the Muslim League has 
remained something of an elitist party and its main strength has 
been the support of the urban middle class. (Maulana Muhammad Ali 
even characterized the delegation as "a command performance").

In his study of the growth of the Muslim League between 1937 and 
1947  years which were crucial to the establishment of Pakistan  
Prof Ian Talbot of the University of Sussex has rightly pointed out 
that even though the League after its establishment claimed to 
represent the Muslims of the whole of India, in essence until the 
end of 1930s, it remained rooted among the Muslim elite of the 
United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh). After the League's dismal 
performance in the elections of 1936-37, Muhammad Ali Jinnah had an 
uphill task in building it into a national party and his task was 
particularly difficult in the provinces which were later to become 
part of Pakistan. Talbot attributes this to the Muslim League's 
"neglect of the major centres of Muslim population, something that 
increasingly became a handicap as the British devolved more powers 
to the provinces."


There is no denying that the North-West Frontier Province, which had 
a higher percentage of Muslims in its population than any other 
province of undivided India, remained a centre of Congress influence 
until almost the final months before partition. Although a Muslim 
League ministry had been inducted in the province after the 
resignation of the Congress ministry, from October 1943 to March 
1945, it fared poorly in the 1946 elections. The Congress-Red Shirts 
were able to form a government in the NWFP with the 'nationalist' 
Muslim, Dr Khan Sahib, as the chief minister. The ministry had to be 
dismissed from office by an executive order of Quaid-i-Azam once 
Pakistan was established.

The Muslim League also did not have a stable position in Sindh even 
though the province was crucial to the demand for Pakistan. The 
party was riven with factionalism and its difficulties arose largely 
from the lack of unity and discipline in the party leadership in the 
province. According to Talbot, the Congress invested much money in 
"cultivating the seamier side of Sindhi politics." The Hindu 
community's wealth also meant that its political leaders were in a 
position to "buy" support in the assembly.

Saleh meet Farhan in Asian snooker final
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Ian Fyfe

KARACHI, Feb 14: Saleh Mohammad qualified for the final round of the 
Asian Tour Snooker tournament to be played in May at Bangkok, 
Thailand, when he upset the reigning Asian champion Anurat Wongjan 
(Thailand) 5-4, on the black tie ball, in an absolute thriller 
played at the Magnolia Mahal, Beach Luxury Hotel on Saturday 
morning.
    
The Pakistan No. 2, who qualified for the knock-out round although 
being overrun by Yasin Merchant (India) 4-0 in his last league 
match, knew he had a battle on his hands when he finished second in 
his Pool and was drawn to meet Aunrat Wongjan.
    
But the brave Pathan never flinched against his awesome opponent and 
potting in great style won the first frame 88/31, before Wongjan 
pulled one back in the next frame to level the scores 1-1 and then 
went ahead 2-1, after pocketing the third frame 70/8.
    
Not to be undone, Saleh with a couple of splendid breaks of 50 and 
60, snatched the next two frames and took over the running once 
again 3-2, which soon increased to 4-2, just a frame away from 
victory.
    
But the Asian champion fought back tooth and nail. Picking up the 
seventh and eighth frames 74/2 and 67/44 he was on level terms once 
again at 4-4.
    
The final frame began in pindrop silence and both cueists began 
rather cautiously trying to cash on each other's mistakes.
    
Saleh managed to break away and was leading 56/43 with just the pink 
and black balls to pot. But it was Wongjan who sunk the two coloured 
balls and the score was tied 56-56, in the final frame. The black 

ball was now to be the decider.
    
As the two fought desperately for the black, it was Saleh with a 
fantastic long shot that potted black and it was all over for the 
Asian champion. Saleh winning the frame 63/56 came through a 5-4 
winner and was lustily cheered to the echo by the knowledgeable 
crowd.
    
Joining Saleh for the trip to Bangkok was young Farhan Mirza, who 
surprised the former world amateur champion Mohammad Yousuf 5-3.
    
Although Yousuf began confidently with a fine break of 40, it was 
Farhan who secured the lead by winning the first frame 62/56. Stung 
into action, Yousuf levelled the frame scores 1-1 only to see Farhan 
take over the lead again by chalking up 45 points on the trot.

Rain-hit Johannesburg Test ends in draw
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Qamar Ahmed

JOHANNESBURG, Feb 18: The first Test between South Africa and 
Pakistan came to its inevitable and predictable conclusion as it 
ended in a draw because of rain and bad light.

After the fourth day's play was abandoned without a ball being 
bowled it was clear then that the game would fizzle out without a 
result. That is exactly what happened on the fifth day when the play 
somehow got going.

South Africa managed to score 44 runs in 10.3 overs in their second 
innings as the match was interrupted three time because of bad light 
could, manage. Umpires Cyril Mitchley and Peter decided to finally 
call off the farcical Test in which 242 overs were lost because of 
poor weather conditions.

Gary Kirsten and Adam Bacher, who had come to o-en their second 
innings on the third evening after Pakistan had recovered and 
reached 329, had to go back in the dressing room without a ball 
faced. Even on the final day as they came in the umpires ruled that 
the floodlight under the light sky had not improved the general 
playing conditions. When play finally resumed at 11.34 a.m. it 
lasted for only 50 minutes more before once again they had to retire 
to the pavilion. The openers scored 44 runs in 0.1 overs. Gary 
Kirsten and Adam Bacher had then made 20 each. In the delayed start 
after lunch only two more balls were bowled and once again the 
players had to leave the field because of the insufficient light.

Both Aamir Sohail and Gary Kirsten agreed later after the match was 
called off that the ICC has got to rethink about the this new rule 
concerning the floodlight used in the Tests. Things are different in 
one day games when the white ball is used and the screens are black.

The dismissal of Mohammad Wasim and Inzamam-ul-Haq in the Test when 
the light was on was due to floodlight, said Aamir Sohail. They did 
not see the ball.

Gary Kirsten also implied that the wicket was not of much help 
either as it had a variable bounce from the start of the first day. 
It could have been an interesting Test match but for the weather and 
floodlight, said Kirsten.


The Pakistan team is now much more confident after having recovered 
from the trauma of the mugging incident and also recovering from an 
early collapse to compile 329 to South Africa's 364. We did well to 
recover with Azhar and Moin Khan playing very important role, said 
Aamir Sohail.

Rashid Latif, the Pakistan captain also appeared to talk to the 
press before the play was finally called off and reassured the media 
that the tour will go ahead and stress and appealed to the media to 
concentrate on cricket rather than rumour-mongering. The allegations 
against the players by the media that they were not telling the 
truth was condemned by the Pakistan captain. We stand by our 
original statement that the boys were mugged outside the hotel, 
there is no other story to it as implied by a certain section of the 
media. We have no reasons to lie. He said.

The disturbing news, however for Rashid Latif is that he may have to 
have an operation to his neck which has two displaced discs. Dr Ali 
Bacher, the Managing Director of the UCBSA, disclosed that Latif 
will go to Bloemfontien with the team but if he feels any discomfort 
he may have to come back to Johannesburg on Monday for a 
consultation and in case of operation he may have to miss the second 
Test as well.

`I may be out for ten days because I am not improving. I will have 
to have an operation then,' a disappointed Pakistan captain told the 
waiting press. Not much later match referee came with his verdict of 
how the match went in and fined Pakistan 60 per cent of the match 
fee for bowling nine overs short in the first innings and south 
Africa, for bowling four overs short, were fined 20 per cent of the 
match fee.
