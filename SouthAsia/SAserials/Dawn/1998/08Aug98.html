<a name="sart">Sartaj new FM: Federal cabinet reshuffled</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Raja Zulfikar

ISLAMABAD, Aug 6: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday re-
allocated portfolios to three federal ministers, dropped one from 
the cabinet and withdrew additional charge from two ministers in 
what appeared to be the first phase of cabinet reshuffle.
    
A notification to the effect said Raja Nadir Pervaiz would now take 
charge of the ministry for communications, Gohar Ayub would look 
after the ministry of water and power while Sartaj Aziz would have 
the portfolio of foreign affairs. These ministers earlier held 
portfolios of water and power, foreign affairs and finance 
respectively.
    
Dr Hafiz Pasha has been made adviser to the prime minister on 
finance with the status of a federal minister. He will continue to 
be the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. His appointment 
as adviser to the prime minister was made by President Rafiq Tarar 
on the advice of the prime minister.
    
Sardar Yaqub Nasir, who was the federal minister for railways, has 
been removed from the cabinet. No one has so far been named for the 
ministry of railways.
    
Minister of State for Water and Power Captain (retd) Haleem 
Siddiqui who held the additional charge of minister of state for 
communications would now cease to hold the portfolio of minister of 
state for communications.
    
Similarly, the notification says that the portfolios of tourism, 
sports and culture which had been entrusted to Sheikh Rashid stand 
withdrawn. He, however, will continue to hold the charge of the 
ministry of labour, manpower and overseas Pakistanis.
    
The long overdue reshuffle in the federal cabinet was officially 
notified late in the evening. It had been approved by the prime 
minister earlier in the day.
    
Sources said that Thursday’s re-allocation of portfolios was the 
first phase of the planned reshuffle which was to be originally 
effected soon after the budget. "More changes are likely to be made 
in the next few days,"  officials said.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The prime minister was talking to a delegation of the ministry of

Reliance Fund (NSRF). The delegation was headed by the Minister of 
State, Capt (retd) Haleem Siddiqui. The secretary to the ministry 
of communications and heads of attached departments were also 
present on the occasion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

MUZAFFARABAD, Aug 6: There was a lull in shelling from the Indian 
side on Thursday after seven days of incessant mortar and artillery 
fire, official sources here said. However, in some sectors Indian 
troops continued to fire with small arms, they added.
    
Indian troops had resorted to mortar, field guns and artillery fire 
in the wee hours of July 30 (Thursday) and continued shelling till 
Aug 5, killing more than 70 people in different villages along the 
Line of Control in Azad Kashmir. More than 130 people suffered 
injuries.
    
On Wednesday, 10 people were killed in Chakothi sector in 
Muzaffarabad and Kahuta and Bagh sectors in district Bagh. One of 
them died in Dhulli, two kilometres from Bagh city. Of the other 
four in Bagh district, two were killed in Phal Ban village and two 
in Chanjal village of Kahuta sector.
    
Four were killed in Kuchha and one in Chamb Doba villages of 
Chakothi sector in the south of Muzaffarabad.
    
Although there was calm along the LoC on Thursday, the people, 
displaced from the firing affected areas, were scared.
    
"We cannot return to our homes as the enemy can resume firing any 
time,"Muzaffar, a resident of Mera Bakot village in Chakothi 
sector who fled the area and was later rehabilitated at Saran with 
at least 1,000 other displaced people, told this correspondent.

<a name="trad">Traders end strike: Demand for fixed tax accepted</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Ihtasham ul Haque

ISLAMABAD, Aug 6: The government here on Thursday acceded to the 
demand of the traders to receive "fixed tax"instead of moving 
towards income based General Sales Tax (GST) regime as was promised 
by the business community last year.
    
A 20-day long strike by the traders and the jewellers came to an 
end on Thursday after traders’ "successful talks"with Minister for 
Commerce Ishaq Dar. The representatives of the traders also decided 
to call off their threatened three day strike.
    
According to the details of the agreement, confirmed officially by 
the ministry of commerce, the government would not insist on the 
registration of those traders whose annual sale was Rs.5 million or 
above to pay Rs.50,000 as part of their GST.
    
"Those with annual turnover of Rs.5 million who have already been 
registered with the department will remain subject to the GST 
regime but there would not be any compulsion for the new assesses 
to join this net,"an official said. In other words, the government 
has decided to give up the idea of recovery of GST from those whose 
sale is Rs.5 million or more per year.
    
Insiders said that the prime minister in fact intervened and 
directed the CBR to stop insisting on income based GST regime to 
avoid political problems for the government. They said the 
government feared that the traders might join hands with the 
Pakistan Peoples Party and Awami National Party and therefore it 
was decided to accept a fixed tax regime, an issue which was likely 
to be opposed by the IMF.
    
Under the agreement, those who are not Income Tax (I.T.) assesses 
would pay only Rs.1,000 per annum as fixed sales tax. Other traders 
who are income tax assesses would pay fixed sales tax (GST) on the 
basis of their sales as follows:
    
-Those whose sale is up to Rs.300,000 per annum would pay Rs.3,000 
annually.
    
-Rs.5,000 as GST by those whose sales are more than Rs.300,000 and 
less than Rs.1 million.

    
-Rs.10,000 as GST by those whose sales is Rs.1 million but does not 
exceeds Rs.2 million.
    
-Rs.15,000 by those whose sale is between Rs.2 million and Rs.3 
million.
    
-Rs.50,000 by those whose sale is between Rs.3 million and Rs.4 
million.
    
According to the agreement those who had been subjected to one per 
cent more sales tax in the budget have been exempted from the fixed 
tax regime.

ISLAMABAD, Aug 3: Two US Senators, Mr Richard Shelby and Mr Tim 
Hutchinson, on Monday called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and

The US senators, who are here on a three-day visit, also met

Ahmed Khan. They also attended a briefing at the GHQ.
    
Officials said the US senators, accompanied by the US ambassador, 
informed the prime minister about steps being taken in the US 
senate to introduce flexibility in the imposition of the Glenn 
amendment.
    
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif appreciated efforts being made in the 
US senate to soften the US law on sanctions.
    
A handout issued after the meeting said the prime minister also 
informed the US senators about his meeting with Indian Prime 
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in Colombo, but regretted that it did 
not produce a positive outcome because of Indian attitude.

States on Monday to play its role in the resolution of Kashmir 
dispute, APP adds.

region and it is important that the international community,

<a name="nawa">Nawaz briefs Tarar on Kashmir situation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 3: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called on President 
Rafiq Tarar here on Monday and discussed with him issues relating 
to security arising out of the continued firing by the Indian army 
on the Line of Control (LoC) which had so far killed more than 70 
people.
    
Informed sources said that the two discussed the preparedness of 
the troops stationed on the LoC and expressed satisfaction over 
their performance. The prime minister told the president that he 
would be meeting the army chief in a day or so to discuss with him 
the unprovoked firing by the Indian army on the LoC. He also hinted 
at the possibility of convening the meeting of the Defence 
Committee of the Cabinet (DCC) on Friday.
    
Sources said that the president and the prime minister also 
discussed a number of other important issues including prime 
minister’s meeting with Indian Prime Minister Mr. Vajpayee at 
Colombo.
    
He told the president that India was not willing to undertake 
meaningful talks with Pakistan to resolve long outstanding issues 
between the countries. Mr Sharif said that he had rejected an 
Indian proposal to first have discussion on other issues, including 
the bilateral trade before the resolution of the Kashmir problem. 
The prime minister said that he had also invited the attention of 
his Indian counterpart of the presence of over half a million 
Indian military troops in Kashmir who were committing human rights 
violations there.
    
He said he has made it amply clear to his Indian counterpart that 
without the resolution of the Kashmir problem, there could not be 
any peace in the region.
    
Sources said both the president and the prime minister discussed 
internal situation with special reference to new PPP-ANP alliance 
against the construction of Kalabagh dam. The prime minister said 
that he had already said that this dam will be built only after 
forging consensus among the provinces. He said he had also directed 
his cabinet colleagues to meet all the political parties and groups 
to have their point of view over the issue.
    
They further discussed reshuffle in the cabinet. The prime minister 
said he may announce the expansion and reshuffle in the cabinet by 
Friday next.
    
They also discussed the economic situation with prime minister 
hoping to conclude soon a new agreement with the IMF. However, 
sources said, he assured the president that there would not be any 
default and that Pakistan’s economic problems were being looked 
after by her friends in the Middle East.

<a name="govt">Govt’s loan recovery campaign stalls</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 4: Government’s loan recovery campaign has been 
stalled owing to the reluctance of banks and development finance 
institutions to provide names of their officers who had been 
involved in extending irregular loans, Dawn reliably learnt.
    
In line with the prime minister’s directive to expedite the 
recovery campaign, a decision to arrest and interrogate bankers was 
taken at a meeting held under the chairmanship of State Bank 
Governor, Dr Yaqoob, in Lahore last week.
    
The banks, as per the decision taken in Lahore, had to provide the 
names of their officers within two days to the FIA but no name had 
been received as yet, said a source.
    
All the nationalized commercial banks and development finance 
institution in the first phase of the recovery campaign had 
referred only 26 cases of loan defaulters to the FIA.
    
The agency, out of the total 26 cases in a countrywide swoop, 
arrested 15 defaulters, including a sitting Senator of the ruling 
party. Some of the defaulters had more than one case against them.
    
In view of the very small number of cases identified by the banks, 
the decision to extend the scope of investigation to the bank 
officers had been taken.

<a name="anti">Anti-dam rally to save federation: Benazir</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 4: Leader of the Opposition Benazir Bhutto has said 
that her party’s decision to participate in the anti-Kalabagh dam 
rally is aimed at saving the federation and not against any one 
province.
    
Ms Bhutto will lead the rally from Ghotki to Obaro on August 10.
    
Addressing the meeting of Sindh Council of the Pakistan People’s 
Party on Monday (partly reported on Tuesday), Ms Bhutto said that 
while the rulers accused the PPP of using the "Sarhad card"by 
forming an alliance with the ANP and the "Sindh card"for anti-dam 
posture, the PPP had called it a "save Pakistan card".
    
She said that the planned rally against the Kalabagh dam would also 
be joined by the people of Punjab despite attempts by the 
government to create obstacles.
    
She asked the government to explain what happened to Ghazi Barotha 
and Ketti Bundar projects, Rohri Hydel project and development 
schemes which were initiated during her government.
    
The PPP chairperson also flayed the census figures, the sacking of 
people, soaring prices and spending the national wealth on the 
development of "personal jagirs"and projects like motorway at the 
cost of other projects.
    
She claimed that Mian Nawaz Sharif was a security risk and 
maintained that despite nuclear explosions Pakistan had become 
weaker as compared to what it was in 1988.
    
It called for the repeal of Ehtesab Act with retrospective effect 
and called for a bipartisan committee with equal representation to 
government and opposition members to conduct a fair accountability.
    
The PPP also demanded that the president and the prime minister 
should resign because it was of the view that they had "pitted 
Pakistan against the United States, West, Japan, India 
simultaneously at a time when Pakistan lacked adequate air cover, 
and its lines of supply were limited due to the foreign exchange 
crisis".
    
The Sindh Council also flayed the increase in petrol price, growing 
unemployment and called upon the regime to "stop sucking the blood"
of shopkeepers, peasants, government servants, workers and 
teachers.
    
"If the people don’t have the money to pay for their bread, then 
from where they will pay the General Sales Tax and utility bills,"
it asked.
    
The council called for postponing the imposition of General Sales 
Tax for one year, writing off the electricity debt of all those who 
were defaulters of Rs50,000 or less, since it was the default of 
WAPDA/KESC for not collecting the bills on time and in monthly 
instalments.

It also demanded arrest of all Nawaz cronies who allegedly withdrew 
million of dollars before the freezing of Foreign Currency 
Accounts, improvement in the law and order situation in Karachi and 
other parts of the country.

<a name="inte">International travel fares to rise by 15 per cent</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Omar Quraishi

LAHORE, Aug 5: Travel fares on all airlines flying out of Pakistan 
including the domestic carrier PIA will rise by 15 per cent. A 
senior PIA official said on Wednesday that the federal government 
had approved the increase which will take effect from September 1 
or a week before that. He also said that fares could go up by 10 
per cent by the end of the year.
    
The official said the last such increase took place on Dec 16, 1996 
and this one is necessitated largely by the two devaluations  the 
first of 8.7 per cent in October 1997 and the second of around 4.4 
per cent last month.
    
The federal government through the Ministry of Defence and the 
Civil Aviation Authority gave approval to the request for the 
increase in international air fares on July 29. PIA and foreign 
airlines flying to Pakistan wanted to implement this from August 1, 
official said, but the approval came too late for that date.
    
The official said PIA had written back to the Ministry of Defence 
asking for the effective date to be advanced by a week from 
September 1. He said the airlines had actually asked for a larger 
increase, of around 25 per cent, but this was not allowed by the 
government.
    
The government did not approve the whole increase that had been 
requested because of adverse public reaction, the official said. It 
is likely that international fares will increase by another 10 per 
cent in another 3 to 4 months, the official said.
    
The published round-trip fare on an economy class seat for travel 
on PIA from Karachi to New York and back is currently Rs 79,860 and 
after the fare hike will rise to Rs 91,840. The discounted fare for 
this journey will rise by around Rs 10,000  from Rs 63,900 to Rs 
73,500. A Lahore travel agent on Tuesday quoted a price of Rs 
58,000 for a round-trip economy ticket to New York and back and 
this should rise to around Rs 66,700 after the fare hike.
    
Similarly, the popular Karachi-London-Karachi and Karachi-Bombay-
Karachi routes which currently cost Rs 43,150 and Rs 8,630 
respectively for a round-trip economy ticket will cost 
approximately Rs 50,000 and Rs 9,920.
    
DOMESTIC FARES: The official said that there was no plan right now 
to increase domestic fares on PIA flights. He said the tariff rates 
might be put under a process of review but any fare hike on 
domestic routes was not on the agenda.
    
FOREIGN AIRLINES LEAVING: After Lufthansa’s recent announcement 
that it was planning to pull out of Pakistan, citing heavy landing 
costs, other charges and other factors (like the availability of 
cheaper and better equipped airports like Dubai), Air Lanka has 
given a notice of its intent to wind up its operations in Pakistan. 
The airline flies twice a week (Monday and Thursday) to Karachi 
from Colombo.

Correspondent

DERA GHAZI KHAN, Aug 5: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif launched the 
second phase of his campaign of land distribution among landless 
tenants by handing over allotment orders among "haris"of Rojhan on 
Wednesday evening.
    
The prime minister awarded ownership rights of 12 acres each among 
100 of the 2,210 haris of Rojhan, Rajanpur district.
    
In his address the PM pledged to carry on his dream of making poor 
haris’ lives respectable by awarding them lands so that they could 
at least make both ends meet.
    
He directed the departments concerned to provide every possible 
facility to the new land owners so that they could cultivate their 
lands.
    
He said he wanted to provide more facilities to farmers, eg 
subsidized power, tubewells, tractors and other farm machinery, at 
reduced prices. He said the government had allocated 40 billion 
rupees for agricultural loans.
    
He expressed a hope that the country would soon become self-
sufficient in food.

<a name="pmof">PM offers to restore ’73 Constitution</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Aug 6: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday offered 
to set up a joint parliamentary committee to look into the issue of 
restoration of the 1973 Constitution if the opposition so desired.
    
Speaking in the Senate on the occasion of the silver jubilee of the 
upper house, Mr Sharif expressed his government’s willingness to 
amend the Constitution with the consent of all political parties 
represented in parliament and said the Constitution should be 
amended with consensus evolved at the joint parliamentary committee 
meeting.
    
NUCLEAR TESTS: Dwelling on the nuclear tests and its consequences, 
he disclosed that a lucrative package had been offered to Pakistan 
to prevent it from carrying out nuclear tests. Had the offer been 
accepted, the country would have been disintegrated, he claimed.
    
In an obvious reference to the United States, he said Islamabad was 
offered restoration of economic and military aid, repeal of 
Symington and Pressler amendments, rectification of disparity in 
conventional weapons with India and writing-off of debts to the 
tune of billions of dollars.
    
Pakistan, Mr Sharif said, was given security guarantees, "but we 
refused to accept those keeping in view the track record of such 
assurances in the past."
    
He said that despite being aware of the economic hardships that 
would follow, his government carried out nuclear tests and made the 
country’s defence impregnable.
    
Pakistan, the prime minister said, was the 7th nuclear power in the 
world today having the capability to defend its borders.    
He pointed out that the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan had 
revived the Kashmir issue at the international level.
    
Justifying the detonation of nuclear devices by Pakistan, the prime 
minister said Pakistan had no option but to go nuclear in view of 
threats to its security after India carried out tests and its 
leaders started issuing provocative statements.
    
Pakistan, he said, had exercised great restraints and had gone for 
the tests after minutely analysing the consequences.
    
Defending the government’s decision to freeze the foreign currency 
accounts, he said, it had been done to prevent the flight of 
capital from the country. He said 80 per cent of those foreign 
currency accounts had been utilized by the successive governments 
in the past.
    
Responding to the criticism by the press over the freezing of 
foreign currency accounts, he said the decision had been taken in 
the larger national interest.
 
The prime minister called upon all political parties to respect the 
massive mandate given by the people to his party.
    
Referring to the debacle of East Pakistan, he said, had the 
political leaders respected each other’s mandate the situation 
would have been different and East and West Pakistan would have 
been intact. It was a great national tragedy but certain elements 
were happy over the dismemberment of the country, he deplored.
    
He regretted that the mandate given to smaller provinces had never 
been respected and no lesson was learnt from the tragedy of East 
Pakistan.
    
Balochs, he said, had been branded as traitors and forced to take 
positions on the mountains. "We respected the mandate of Balochs,"
he said, adding that his government had not repeated the mistake of 
the past.
    
Recalling the dismissal of Muslim League government in the NWFP, he 
said, it had the mandate in 1993 but it had never been respected.
    
TALKS WITH VAJPAYEE: Mr Sharif informed the Senate about his recent 
talks with Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee.
    
He said he had reiterated Pakistan’s stand on the Kashmir issue 
during his talks with Mr Vajpayee in Colombo earlier this month.

<a name="with">Withdrawal of export tax demanded</a>	
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

RAWALPINDI, Aug 6: The Rawalpindi Chambers of Commerce and Industry 
(RCCI) has asked the government of Punjab to immediately withdraw 
the increase in export tax as it would lead to worsening of the law 
and order situation.
    
In a statement on Thursday, the RCCI chief, Sohail Altaf expressed 
dismay over the unilateral increase of the export tax and said it 
would cast a negative impact on inter-district trade and the 
consumer prices.
    
"People are already hard hit by the sky rocketing prices, this 
abrupt increase will make the prices shoot up further and will in 
turn adversely effect the commodities’ sale leading to economic 
stagnation of a higher degree," he said.
    
He suggested that the authorities should take into confidence 
leaders of the business community, before taking such decisions 
that have direct bearing on the trade and business. ‘In this way, 
the fears of businessmen and people at large can be allayed and the 
backlash of consumers in general can be averted, after the 
implementation of such decisions", he concluded.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Dilawar Hussain

KARACHI, Aug 6: The Hub Power Company Limited (Hubco) announced 
better-than-expected financial results for the year to end-June 
1998, which sent the price of its stock up three per cent from 
Rs13.20 to Rs 13.60 by the close of the trading session on 
Thursday.
    
The company unveiled net profit at Rs10.8 billion, equivalent to 
earning per share (EPS) at Rs9.34, reflecting growth of 47.9 per 
cent over the 1996 net profit at Rs7.3 billion and EPS at Rs6.34.
    
The earnings generally turned out to be better by 10 to 15 per cent 
over the projections of most energy stock analysts at major 
brokerage houses. "We had estimated EPS at Rs8.3 and the actual 
outcome has been one of pleasant surprise", admitted Mudassir Malik 
of BMA Capital Management.

<a name="doll">Dollar touches new peak in inter-bank market</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 6: The price of the dollar rose further in inter-bank 
market touching a new peak at Rs 54.20 on Thursday against Rs 53.50 
on Wednesday. Official rates remained intact at Rs 46 and Rs 46.23 
per dollar for buying and selling.
    
This pushed up the State Bank composite rates to Rs 49.67 and Rs 
50.05 for buying and selling from Rs 49.49 and Rs 49.86 on 
Wednesday.
    
The SBP composite rates are based on weighted average of buying and 
selling rates of some 16 banks. The composite rates of individual 
banks also crossed Rs 50 per dollar for selling.
    
Senior bankers said the most immediate reason for the increase in 
dollar rates was about $10 million worth of buying by a state- run 
and a foreign bank. They said after the buying was over the inter-
bank rate fell to Rs 53.80 per dollar.

But they say much would depend on whether the State Bank makes more 
purchases of dollar from the banks. During July 29-August 4 it 
bought some $31.8 million which caused the price of the dollar to 
shoot up.
    
KERB MARKET: The rupee ended 10 paisa lower against the dollar in 
the kerb market on Thursday to close at 56.50 and 56.60 for spot 
buying and selling against the Wednesday close of 56.40 and 56.50. 
    
Money changers said there was a buying pressure on the greenback 
which, they said, might remain intact for some days.

<a name="bank">Banks asked to issue temporary receipts for $-bonds</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 5: The State Bank asked all banks on Wednesday to 
start issuing temporary receipts in place of dollar-bonds to the 
holders of frozen foreign currency deposits.
    
A SBP circular (SD no 06) said issuance of receipts would be a 
stop-gap arrangement "till printing and supply of these bonds."
    
The State Bank announced on July 21 that holders of foreign 
currency accounts frozen on May 28 1998 could either withdraw their 
balance deposits in rupees or invest them in the dollar-bonds. It 
took the SBP a full fortnight to announce the procedure for the 
issuance of the bondstemporary receipts to be precise.
    
The proposed bonds are of 5-year, 7-year and 10-year maturity and 
carry an annual return equal to six-month Libor, six-month Libor 
plus 1 per cent and six-month Libor plus 2 per cent. Libor stands 
for London inter-bank offer rates. At present six-month Libor is 
around 5.75 per cent. The bonds are being issued in the 
denominations of US$100, US$1000, US$10,000 and US$100,000.
    
The circular advises all banks to contact SBP chief managers in 
Karachi and Lahore to procure the required amount of the bonds. It 
further advises them to indicate on each bond the name of the bank 
branch from where it is being sold and the date of issue.
    
The circular says that for issuing the US dollar-bonds the Deutsche 
Mark, Japanese Yen and Pound sterling amount of the foreign 
currency deposits will be converted into US dollar by crossing the 
State Bank’s spot buying rate for the dollar with the rates of 
these currencies published by the foreign exchange rates committee.

The forward cover fee for unexpired period of the contract, if any 
will be refunded to the bank concerned by Karachi and Lahore 
offices of SBP. The circular says the banks will report the issue 
of dollar- bonds to SBP chief managers in Karachi and Lahore on 
daily basis. It says the necessary working procedure regarding 
payment of interest and encashment of the bonds maturity will be 
issued separately.
    
Bankers reached by Dawn said the very fact that the procedure for 
payment of interest and encashment of bonds is yet to be notified 
would dampen the spirit of potential buyers as well as the banks. 
    
"Why on earth a buyer would show any interest in the bond until he 
does not know about how the banks will pay them and how he will 
encash these bonds,"wondered a bank treasurer. He also said that 
the issuance of temporary receipts in place of the bonds would not 
work for "hardly any potential buyer would accept this 
arrangement."

<a name="idbh">IDB hopeful of raising $1.5bn for Pakistan</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Syed Rashid Husain

RIYADH, Aug 5: In an extraordinary meeting of Islamic banks and the 
financial institutions operating in the region, convened by the 
Jeddah-based Islamic Development Bank (IDB) on August 8, a 
consortium of Islamic banks is likely to be set up to bail Pakistan 
out of its current economic and financial imbroglio.
    
Invitations have been sent to some 13 Islamic banks and 
institutions to participate in the meeting whose basic objective is 
to strengthen Pakistan’s balance of payments situation and hence 
its bargaining power with other international multilateral donor 
agencies.
    
The way things are moving, there are indications that up to $1 
billion could be raised in cash as a result of the meeting and 
about another $500 million as rollover of swaps could be agreed 
upon during the meeting.
    
Sources within the IDB is hopeful of raising something between $1 
billion to $1.5 billion during the meeting in Jeddah.
    
In another related move, IDB has increased Pakistan’s drawing 
rights from $250 million to $400 million to overcome the current 
cash crunch. Another $400 million have been earmarked as Pakistan’s 
specific credit limit for other Islamic countries to finance their 
imports from Pakistan, the Pakistani envoy in Riyadh, Khalid 
Mahmood, told Dawn.
    
Ambassador Khalid Mahmood said that Saudi Arabia has encouraged the 
IDB and other Islamic financial institutions to help Pakistan out 
of the current situation. In fact there has been a nod from a 
person no less eminent than the Crown Prince Abdallah for Pakistan 
to organize a fund raising campaign in Saudi Arabia.
    
As a result, steering committees have been established in major 
town and cities of the Kingdom to mobilize funds into the National 
Self Reliance Funds from both expatriate Pakistanis and non-
Pakistanis including the Saudis.
    
The Embassy of Pakistan expects a very encouraging response soon 
after the holidays season is over in mid-September.
    
The Pakistani envoy is of the opinion that despite all the cash 
crunch faced by Saudi Arabia, because of the low oil prices and the 
stress on Saudization of the manpower, the import of Pakistani 
manpower would still be significant and may even increase.
    
"This is one of the ways in which the Saudis can help us and I 
expect it to increase because of the all out support they have 
extended to us during this crisis period."he stated.
    
Meanwhile, in another related development the Organization of 
Islamic Conference (OIC) has already sent out to all its member 
countries the Pakistani request to convene an extraordinary session 
of the OIC to discuss the situation arising out of the nuclear 
blasts of India followed by that of Pakistan.
    
The OIC secretariat is awaiting the response of the member 
countries and as per the procedure if the two-third majority speaks 
in favour of holding the extraordinary session it would be held 
soon.
 
Once a mechanism is set up and the expatriate Pakistani population 
is convinced that their lifelong savings would stay safe, raising 
another $1 billion to $1.5 billion should not be a major problem. 
Would someone back in Pakistan try and evolve a mechanism to 
restore the shattered confidence of the overseas Pakistanis.

<a name="kptg">KPT Golden Handshake Scheme extended up to 31st</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 5: The Karachi Port Trust (KPT) has extended the 
validity of its golden handshake scheme (GHS) up to August 31, 1998 
after having a poor response from its employees on this score, 
sources in the KPT told Dawn on Wednesday.
    
The KPT offered the scheme on June 8, 1998 for more than 12,000 
employees and officers and the last date for the receipt of option 
was August 2, 1998, the sources said.
    
They added that an estimated 200-250 employees, which came to 
hardly 2 to 2.5 per cent of the total staff strength, chose to fill 
the GHS forms.
    
Despite the fact that the Trust has offered a number of incentives 
under the scheme, the employees interviewed by Dawn feel that the 
package is not so attractive as the ones offered by the various 
local banks and development financial institution (DFIs).
    
The sources added that employees were reluctant to go in for GHS 
and they did not particularly like KPT’s decision to deduct the 
income tax as per Income Tax Rules.

<a name="rs1b">Rs1bn expansion plan approved by PTCL board</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ihtashamul Haq

ISLAMABAD, Aug 5: The Board of the Directors of the Pakistan 
Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) approved here on Wednesday 
a new expansion programme including the setting up of its three new 
subsidiaries with an investment of over Rs1 billion.
    
The meeting, which was presided over by the PTCL Chairman, Nasim 
Mirza approved the establishment of Pak Telecom Mobile Co, Pak 
Telecom Pay Phone Service and Pak Internet Limited.
    
"All these three subsidiaries will be 100 per cent owned by the 
PTCL and will open a new chapter for providing a lot more services 
to the people", said PTCL Chairman Nasim Mirza.
    
In an interview to Dawn he said that although the PTCL was 
providing Internet services to its subscribers, a decision has been 
taken to set up a separate company to further facilitate the 
people. Similarly, he said that Pak Telephone Mobile Co, would be 
set up to provide inexpensive mobile services, compared to other 
three foreign companies currently operating in Pakistan.
    
He said Rs1 billion will be spent to set up these three 
subsidiaries, while Rs2 billion was needed for providing 750,000 
new telephone lines during the next 18 months period.
    
Mirza said that new connections will be offered both in urban and 
rural areas. "Then lot of money will be spent for replacing old 
telephone exchanges", he said adding that the PTCL was being made a 
highly competitive organization to facilitate its privatization.
    
Responding to a question he said that the PTCL has been successful 
in reducing additional cost per line. "We are squeezing our 
suppliers inspite of the devaluation of the rupee to provide needed 
items on comparatively less charges".
    
He disclosed that the PTCL was further reducing charges for 
international calls. "Every year we will be reducing 15 per cent 
tariff on international calls", he said.   Mirza regretted that the 
Standard and Poor, a New York-based credit rating agency has 
downgraded the rating of the PTCL without any justification. "Our 
rating has been linked to the country rating and in this behalf we 
were told that since Pakistan went for freezing the Foreign 
Currency Accounts (FCAs), Standard and Poor was forced to down 
grade the credit rating for the PTCL as well", he said adding that 
he had argued with the agency but in vain.
    
He said PTCL needed to borrow Rs2 to 3 billion during the current 
financial year for its expansion programme. "Our equity is more 
than Rs51 billion and as such borrowing this amount both from the 
local and foreign sources is not some thing very big".
    
Asked about the Central Excise Duty (CED) on telephone bills, he 
conceded it was far too high and needed to be reduced. He said this 
CED should be brought down from 25 to 15 per cent which has already 
been reduced from 40 to 25 per cent.

Reporter

LAHORE, Aug 3: Competition in the cellular phone market might 
shrink if Instaphone’s plans to buy out Paktel go through.
    
An informed source told Dawn that talks were in their final stages 
between US-based Millicom which has a controling stake in 
Instaphone and UK-based telecommunications giant Cable and Wireless 
which has majority shares in Paktel.
    
There are an estimated 150,000 cellular phone users in Pakistan out 
of which Paktel has roughly a 50 per cent share. Mobilink has 
around 30 per cent with the rest going to Instaphone.
    
Cable and Wireless wants to disinvest from Paktel because of 
certain strategic changes in its development direction and because 
Pakistan does not figure so prominently in its investment 
programme, the source said.

<a name="stoc">Stocks recover 52 points on positive news</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Aug 7: The KSE 100-share index surged by six per cent, a 
hefty single-session gain, as the strength of leading base shares 
spilled over to the broader market followed by some positive news 
from the economic front and perception of change in the current 
bearish cycle.
    
"There are more good news than the market could digest just in one 
go but the major boost came from the news of economic bail-out plan 
initiated by the Islamic Development Bank,"analysts said.
    
"The fear of a possible default on foreign debt repayments are now 
fading as forex reserves will attain a viable level after IDB 
package,"he added.
    
The KSE 100-share index recovered another 52 points at 972.96 as 
compared to 921.02 a day earlier, lifting market capitalization by 
another Rs 12.376 billion to Rs 282.727 billion.
    
"The index is certainly heading to achieve its base level of 1,000 
points and could stay well above it as the developing economic 
scenario points,"analysts said.
    
The change of the finance minister, whose post-nuclear test 
policies could not get general approval, was also a supporting 
positive factor as the new economic managers are expected to 
initiate fresh salvage plans, they added.
    
Hub-Power again came in for strong support at the lower level as 
the news of a record profit of Rs 11 billion for the financial year 
ended June 30, 1998, could ensure an increased final. The 
management has already paid an interim of 70%.
    
The market advance was, however, led by PTCL, which came in for 
massive short-covering at the current lows and finished with an 
extended gain of Rs 1.95, which in turn boosted the index by about 
6% owing to its 34% weightage in it.
    
Big gainers were again led by PSO and Shell Pakistan, despite 
disruption of supplies to its retail outlets owing to oil tankers 
strike, Engro Chemical, Fauji Fertilizer, Adamjee Insurance and 
Lever Brothers, which showed fresh gains ranging from Rs 1.60 to Rs 
25. Prime Bank and Crescent Bank were leading among the losers, 
falling by one rupee to Rs 2.75.
    
Trading volume fell to 83 million shares owing to a short Friday 
session as compared to 110 million shares a day earlier. 
    
Out of the 112 actives, 57 shares rose, 18 fell with 37 holding on 
to the last levels.
    
PTCL led the list of most actives, up Rs 1.95 at Rs 21.45 on 44.240 
million shares, followed by Hub-Power, higher one rupee at Rs 14.60 
on 28.476 million shares, ICI Pakistan, up 70 paisa at Rs 12.90 on 
4.126 million shares, PSO, sharply higher Rs 3.75 at Rs 87.25 on 
1.077 million shares, and FFC-Jordan Fertilizer, firm 45 paisa at 
Rs 13.65 on 0.818 million shares.
    
Other actively traded shares included Fauji Fertilizer, up Rs 3.60 
on 0.814 million shares, Southern Electric, firm 20 paisa on 0.650 
million shares, Ibrahim Fibre, steady 10 paisa on 0.269 million 
shares, Sui Southern, up 35 paisa on 0.217 million shares, Sui 
Northern, higher 55 paisa on 0.216 million shares, and MCB, up 60

<a name="braz">Brazen-faced corruption</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ardeshir Cowasjee
    
IF THE corruption of our rulers stopped at taking bribes and 
kickbacks, and at merely defaulting on loans, we would not be as 
bankrupt as we are today. Having destroyed every institution in the 
the country the legislature, the executive, the judiciary  they 
have firmly institutionalized corruption in the meanest sense of 
the word.
    
Sindh has been particularly unfortunate. Most of its chief 
ministers have been exceedingly corrupt and to further their 
purposes have appointed corrupt ministers. In the ministry of 
housing & town planning much money is made with great facility, and 
what each minister leaves behind is an increasingly unhealthy and 
decaying environment. Abdullah Shah, chief minister of Sindh in our 
last government, the second Benazir government, went into hiding 
the day she fell in 1996, and chooses to remain a proclaimed 
absconder.
    
Anticipating corruption, Section 4-B of the Sindh Building Control 
Ordinance was inserted as early as 1979 specifically providing for 
the appointment of a Public Committee to oversee the functioning of 
the Karachi Building Control Authority. Despite the legislation, 
and despite the efforts of the citizens, no committee was appointed 
for eighteen years. The reason was patently obvious. Successive 
governments wanted no fetters on their natural propensity to rob. 
The law was brazenly flouted.
    
In 1996, caretaker minister of H&TP Maqbool Habib Ibrahim 
Rahimtoola (obviously not corrupt ) allowed himself to be persuaded 
by the citizens to constitute an eighteen-member watch- dog 
committee. It was composed of architects, engineers, town- 
planners, lawyers, builders and ministry representatives. Barrister 
Faez Isa volunteered to do all the legal work. Engineer Roland de 
Souza represented the NGO, Shehri, and I represented the weakest 
constituency, the voiceless people.
    
All gave freely of their time. During the seventeen months of the 
committee’s life we met seventeen times. Though we were not able to 
control the rot, we managed to stem it. Credit for what we managed 
to achieve is also due in some part to the then director-general of 
the KDA and the chief executive officer of the KBCA, Shah Mohammad 
Misbah, an architect well-versed in his profession.
    
That the committee was effective is manifested by the fact that 
early this July, for no valid reason, Misbah was peremptorily 
transferred and the committee disbanded. All we saw was a 
notification issued on July 4 announcing the supersession of the 
December 1996 notification appointing our committee, and "in 
exercise of the powers conferred....... the Government of Sindh is 
pleased to reconstitute a committee to oversee the functioning of 
KBCA."The reconstituted nine-member committee is to be chaired by 
the secretary of the ministry who will be assisted by six minor, 
obedient and controllable government functionaries; two members of 
the ruling coalition spoilers (one PML and one MQM MPA); and one 
solitary non-governmental man, Citizen Ardeshir Cowasjee (described 
by the insulting adjective ‘notable’).
    
Why, I asked MQM minister Waseem Akhtar, has this been suddenly 
done? We were appointed to function for two years. All he could say 
was that whatever he did was well within his powers, and that since 
I had been made a member why was I complaining? To argue with him 
would have been a waste of time. The secretary of the ministry who 
issued the notification, Syed Faisal Saud, has also since been 
transferred. The new secretary, Mahmud Ali Khan, a former KDA 
official, professed ignorance. Chief secretary Zubair Kidwai 
resisted this bad move but was overridden by the decision taken 
jointly by MQM minister Waseem Akhtar and PML chief minister 
Liaquat Jatoi, each as devious as the other.
 
To those who may ask what did our committee of eighteen do and what 
did we achieve, kindly read the comprehensive report published in 
Dawn, on page 5, on July 31.
    
To those who gleefully and sheepishly ask what I myself have 
achieved after writing so much on the subject, and ask why the two 
monstrous commercial buildings still continue to rise on 
residential plots on the main Clifton Road, my answer is to ask 
them in return what they have done to help matters, in or out of 
the courts, here and in Islamabad. What have they contributed in 
terms of time and money over the years of struggle? Have they any 
idea of the apathy and lethargy that prevails within the ranks of 
the executive and the judiciary? Do they know how far the money and 
the tentacles of the building mafia extend?
    
To those who ask what I and the few that work with me are doing, I 
ask them what they are doing to see that the authorities act as 
they should. I also ask the authorities  the government of Sindh 
and the Clifton Cantonment Board  what exactly it is that stops 
them from doing their duty in terms of the law.
    
On to another equally serious, debilitating (and ludicrous) type of 
fraud, academic fraud. We read in Dawn on July 28 an APP news item 
informing us that the Karachi University wishes to confer upon 
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif the honorary degree of LL.D. It seems 
that a batch of the mass of sycophants that operate in this country 
moved a proposal on July 25 at a meeting of the University 
Syndicate (the joint movers were Professors Pervez Siddiqui, Afzal 
Kazmi, and Dr. Haroon Rashid, Associate Professor Dr Rehana Ifzal, 
Assistant Professor Majid Mumtaz, Lecturer Ruhi Ahmed). They moved 
that the degree be conferred upon Mr Nawaz Sharif "in view of his 
bold decision regarding strategies of the country’s defence."The 
other syndicate members present acquiesced. If it is confirmed at 
the next meeting of the syndicate, the motion will be sent to the 
chancellor for his approval.
    
On Friday afternoon, whilst talking to the chancellor, governor of 
Sindh and a decent human being Lt General Moinuddin Haider, I 
suggested that as the head of this academic institution he should 
protect its dignity and summarily sack the sycophantic movers and 
approvers for trying to make a monkey out of our prime minister.
 
Special Adviser to the prime minister Anwar Zahid, who still seems 
to be a reasonable and well-adjusted man, whose advice Nawaz Sharif 
might still be tempted to take, should advise him correctly. He is 
senior enough to remember what Mohammad Ali Jinnah, a man who knew 
his own worth, wrote to the Vice- Chancellor of Aligarh University, 
Mohammad Ziauddin, on October 4 1942 : "While I appreciate very 
much indeed the spirit which has activated the Court to take this 
decision [conferment of an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws] , I 
have, most reluctantly, to say that I have lived as plain Mr Jinnah 
and I hope to die as plain Mr Jinnah. I am very much averse to any 
title or honours and I will be more happy if there was no prefix to 
my name."
    
Zahid knows that Oxford refused to confer honorary doctorates upon 
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Margaret Thatcher. He may also remember 
how, in 1987, sycophants and fraudsters of another age, without 
asking the court of that university, announced that the Thai 
University of Thammasat would confer upon the then visiting 
President of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq, an honorary doctorate. 
When Thammasat was approached to lay down the red carpet, the 
chancellor flatly refused, as they had refused their Prime Minister 
Prem Tinsulanond. The Thai government was then constrained to bribe 
the relatively small and impoverished Chulalangkorn University to 
agree to confer the required degree. Very sheepishly it did so, in 
camera.
    
In 1989, Benazir Bhutto also humiliated herself by accepting, in 
Karachi, an honorary degree of Doctor of Science Honoris Causa from 
the yet to be formed Zoroastrian University of Bombay. That 
conferment gave the conferrer and cost the nation a cool Rs.100 
crores in bank loans. The caterer-conferrer remains to this day a 
defaulter.  
   
To those who ask whether we can survive as a nation, the answer is 
‘Yes’. Sudan, Ethiopia, Rwanda, all do. Whether we can carry weight 
in the world? Again, ‘Yes’. Fifteen years of sustained hard labour 
may help, but only if we are consistently led by educated men, 
strong enough to know how weak we are. Charlatans and thieves 
cannot deliver.

<a name="perp">Perpetuating the system   </a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Irfan Husain

ONE of the most rewarding things about writing this column is that 
I am often asked to look at projects or problems so that I can 
bring them to public attention.
    
Frankly, I have no illusions about the power of the press to right 
the many wrongs that afflict us, but many of us keep trying anyway, 
probably to salve our own conscience. Recently, Hamid Maker, one of 
the moving spirits behind the Helpline Trust, asked me to see what 
he and his colleagues were doing to try and improve the conditions 
prevailing in government schools.
    
In the last year or so, the Trust has launched an "Adopt a School"
scheme through which individuals or institutions can make donations 
to specific schools in Karachi controlled by the Sindh government. 
The idea is to improve the infrastructure, raise teaching skills, 
and generally make things a little less appalling for students and 
teachers.
   
The Sindh Educational Foundation is playing a similar role in the 
rest of the province. Helpline has got sponsorship to adopt 30 
schools, and its volunteers took me to see what they had done with 
Canadian government assistance at Sharfabad School.
    
What I saw was heartbreaking. Located in the middle of the solidly 
middle class area of Bahadurabad, the school has been transformed 
into a wasteland by Bhutto’s mindless nationalization policy and 
subsequent official neglect. Established in the sixties by the 
Pakistan Bihari Association, the large three-storeyed building is 
open and airy and has substantial playing fields. For non-payment 
of its electricity bills, the school had no power when I went to 
visit it. All payments, including the pitiful salaries, are made 
directly by the education department, and the administration does 
not even control the meagre tuition fees of 55 rupees per year per 
student.
    
The derelict structure speaks of years of malign neglect: many 
windowpanes are broken; there has been no paint applied to the 
walls in a long time; and much of the furniture should have been 
scrapped long ago. The laboratory is a mockery, with a few rusting 
pieces of equipment and a handful of test tubes. No funds have been 
released in years for the most essential repair and maintenance. 
And if any money was allocated, it has certainly not reached the 
school.
    
This institution is a stark indictment of the priority the 
Pakistani state and society have accorded to education. Here is a 
school that started out as a perfectly sound centre for learning, 
with enlightened sponsors who raised a substantial amount of money 
to create a spacious, well-equipped facility. By all accounts, 
standards were high in this English-medium school, and graduates 
went on to excel in various fields. Students were largely drawn 
from the neighbouring areas of Bahadurabad and PECHS, and got 
excellent results.
    
Then came the disastrous nationalization of 1972, and control of 
the school passed into the hands of the Sindh education department. 
Steadily, standards fell and more and more parents moved their 
children to private institutions, until by the early eighties, 
Sharfabad school had been dragged down to the level of other 
government-run schools. Now, local children go to distant private 
schools, while poor, working-class parents send their kids to 
Sharfabad School, where 750 of them study in two shifts. Teachers 
are paid an average of Rs 3,000 per month, and not a penny is spent 
on maintenance.
    
The Helpline initiative, praiseworthy as it is, is only a drop in 
the ocean. Out of the Rs 100,000 donated by the Canadian 
government, 10% was retained by the Trust to pay for a medical 
check-up for students and a refresher course for teachers, and the 
balance was spent on the school. In a building of this size, the 
money was barely enough to repair the bathrooms and some of the 
desks. I was informed that the provincial government was due to 
release some funds that could be spent on the school by the Parent-
Teacher Association.
    
But given the fact that very few of the parents who send their 
children to the school are literate, it is questionable if the PTA 
will be effective in establishing priorities and controlling the 
money. Indeed, there is a genuine concern that this scheme will 
turn into yet another scam.
    
Awful as the conditions at the Sharfabad School are, the sad fact 
is that they pale into insignificance when compared to those 
prevailing at most government schools. The teachers are dedicated 
despite their ridiculous salaries and the miserable working 
conditions, and the students are motivated despite their 
background. So without funding or proper facilities, classes are 
held and against all odds, a semblance of normality prevails. But 
obviously, graduates from this and other government-controlled 
institutions are at a huge disadvantage while competing with the 
products of private schools and colleges.
    
This is the tragedy of education in Pakistan: we have deliberately 
created a two-track system that perpetuates and reinforces the 
class divide. While private schools the world over generally give 
their students an edge, nowhere is it as pronounced as it is here 
because the public sector schools are so terrible.
    
Needless to say, this contrast works to the advantage of the elite 
because it ensures that their children will be able to get the top 
positions in the country, while the educated underclass from the 
government system will have to fight for underpaid clerical and 
mental jobs. Seen in this context, the apathy of successive 
governments towards education is perfectly understandable, if not 
excusable.
    
What Bhutto’s nationalization policy did was to pull private 
schools down to the abysmal level of government schools, and 
education in Pakistan has yet to recover from that devastating 
blow. Indeed, as products of this rotten system teach the next 
generation, there has been steady deterioration. The one thing that 
is keeping us afloat is the private education system.
    
And as the state retreats from its obligation to provide all its 
citizens a decent education, individuals and NGOs are stepping in 
to fill the vacuum with creative initiatives. But the dead hand of 
the provincial and federal education departments ensures that the 
public sector institutions stagnate and deteriorate until they are 
thoroughly discredited and marginalized.
    
So when there is brave talk about the new millennium, the 
information revolution and the tiger economies, rest assured that 
it does not strike a responsive chord in Sharfabad School.

<a name="sena">Senate, democracy and federation</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Nazeer Ahmad Mahar

AUGUST 6, 1973, is a memorable day in the political history of the 
country, when for the first time the second chamber of parliament, 
the Senate, started functioning. Now that the Senate completes its 
25 years, there is a need to assess the relevance and effects of 
Pakistan’s experience with the second chamber. 

The world is undergoing sweeping changes at a galloping rate. It 
has increasingly become a difficult task to comprehend, relate and 
analyze the fast-changing landscape of politics in juxtaposition 
with socio-economic dynamics of a modern state, which has become 
more susceptible to global pressures. These developments have 
brought democratic governance and parliament to the centre of 
debate.
    
The close of this century and that of the millennium has witnessed 
the triumphant march of democracy through the length and breadth of 
the world. Today, 179 out of 193 countries of the world have 
parliaments. According to The New York Times, 3.1 billion people 
live in democracies, 2.66 billion do not. There have also been 
elections galore in recent years. Yet cynicism on account of 
electoral democracy’s failure to deliver abounds.
    
Democracy, with all its concomitants and fruits is, by and large, a 
phenomenon specific to the countries of North Atlantic littoral 
states, whereas most Third World countries and new democracies in 
eastern and central Europe are still far from reaching the level of 
genuine democratic polity and society.
    
However, three developments in the global arena would seem to have 
a positive effect on the democratization process in Third World 
countries. Firstly, the contemporary times are witnessing 
unprecedented globalization which has exposed the malleability of 
nation-states; a sort of transnational government is in the making 
transcending the existing state system. The trimming of enlarged 
state would strengthen civil society and hence democracy itself.
    
Secondly, concurrently with the above trend, emphasis on less 
government and devolution has been accentuated for achieving rapid 
economic development. This augurs well for democracy, because 
decentralization envisages participatory democracy and empowerment 
of the parliament in order to fill the gap left behind by overly 
stretched government.
    
Harvard academic Samuel P. Huntington has recently pointed out that 
a correlationship exists between the level of democracy and that of 
economic development. In his view, all wealthy countries, with the 
exception of oil-rich states, are democratic, and almost all of the 
poor countries in the world are not democratic.
    
Thirdly, with the increasing emphasis on decentralization and 
devolution of power in contemporary times, not only the power 
equations are fast changing and parliament is becoming more 
relevant, but bicameralism and federalism have also moved to the 
centre of political discourse. Devolution of power to the lower 
rungs of authority presupposes the strengthening of the second 
chamber, since it reflects the diversity of the state and gives 
space to the constituent units to ventilate their aspirations and 
grievances.
    
The example of contemporary Britain is very instructive in this 
regard. There with the ascension of Labour Party into power last 
year, the devolution of power to Scotland and Northern Ireland is 
taking place simultaneously with drastic reforms in the House of 
Lords to change the hereditary character of its composition, and 
hence giving it a representative character which, eventually, 
empowers the house.
    
There are 63 second chambers in the parliaments of the world today. 
Though the increasing number of unitary states are also adopting 
bicameral parliament  to have a multiple check on hasty and 
unbridled legislation, and on the government itself. Indeed, there 
is a definite link between bicameralism and federalism, because 
none of the federal states have defied the bicameral legislature, 
hence the federal chamber has become the popular chamber.
    
In a federal state, the parliament should be broadly representative 
of the nation as a whole, and not subject to excessive domination 
by more populous states. This is the reason that the national 
parliament in federal states inevitably needs to have two chambers, 
the first providing proportional representation and the second 
equal representation in the constituent units. Rather, the second 
chamber, and its position in the legislative process is of pivotal 
importance in a federal state. This is imperative for reasons of 
balance and harmony.
    
One of the distinctive features of the US constitution is that it 
also provides for a second chamber, which is equal in powers with 
the first chamber, legislative as well as financial, and even, in 
certain respects, more powerful. Hence, it provides the best 
example of a political system combining federal system with the 
bicameral parliament.
    
The introduction of the second chamber in the 1973 Constitution was 
a new development in the constitutional history of Pakistan. Two 
earlier constitutions, i.e. 1956 and 1962, did not provide for a 
second chamber. The reason for this apparent lapse was patent. 
After the adoption of parity between eastern and western wings of 
the country, and the merger of the western wing into a single 
administrative unit in 1955, a second chamber would have been an 
unnecessary appendage. Because the second chamber generally ensures 
equal representation of the constituent units, that was already 
there in popular chamber.
    
The second chamber was provided in the 1973 Constitution, and 
rightly so, because there were wide differences in the populations 
of the four constituent units after the abolition of the One Unit 
in 1970, and a popular chamber alone would not have provided 
sufficient safeguards to smaller provinces. Though there was an 
interregnum of eight years (1977-85), when the Senate did not 
function because of the suspension of the Constitution, since 1985 
onwards, it has been in place without a break, thus becoming the 
longest surviving political institution in the country. In an 
environment of despair and pessimism that has marked the history of 
this hapless nation, it can be said that the Senate is one of the 
institutions that the country should rightly take pride in.
    
Almost all second chambers are either indirectly elected or 
nominated barring a few exceptions, the US being prominent amongst 
them. Out of sixty-three second chambers existing in the world 
today, thirty made up of unelected members drawn either through 
appointments or having ex-officio membership. Even leading 
bicameral parliaments with the exception of America, Australia and 
France, do not have fully elected upper houses. All the members of 
the Canadian Senate are appointed by the governor- general on 
advice of the prime minister, while the second chambers in India, 
Belgium and Italy are partly elected and partly nominated.
    
Second, the Senate of Pakistan provides for equal representation to 
the provinces. As against this, many second chambers around the 
world do not provide equal representation to all constituent units. 
India stands out amongst them; there the Rajya Sabha membership 
varies according to the population status of various constituent 
states.
    
A comparison of federal structures of India and Pakistan reveals 
the fact that the federal structure of Pakistan is superior, more 
reflective of the diversity of its society than the Indian 
federalism, primarily because of the uneven composition of the 
latter’s second chamber. Hence the parliament in India is 
overwhelmingly dominated by the Hindi-belt provinces because of 
their demographic preponderance, whereas the case in Pakistan is 
one of equality of representation. Another aspect, that cannot be 
glossed over is that of the credentials of the Senators. A 
comparative look into the educational and professional backgrounds 
of the members of the legislative bodies of Pakistan makes it 
abundantly clear that the Senate has got among its members highly 
educated people with good professional backgrounds. The obligatory 
inclusion of 20 seats, reserved for technocrats, has also 
contributed to this. Thus, the Senate is not just a house of 
elders; to an extent, it represents the educated and professional 
cream of society.
    
The Senate in Pakistan has certainly provided a forum to smaller 
provinces to ventilate their grievances and seek accommodation of 
their aspirations. One of the explanations for the secession of the 
eastern wing in 1971 is that the institutional mechanism provided 
in two earlier constitutions was inadequate to provide true 
representation to the constituent units, particularly Bengal. The 
post-1971 Pakistan, through its bicameral system has achieved a 
degree of balance between different provinces.
    
The issues which are contentious between the provinces, or between 
the federation and the provinces, are thoroughly debated in the 
Senate and its committees as well. Many times, the opinion of 
minority provinces has prevailed in the second chamber, which is 
not possible in a popular chamber. And it has been proved that a 
single unit, on the basis of its demographic preponderance, cannot 
influence the legislation to the detriment of the smaller 
constituents. The Senate has also successfully provided the dual 
check on hasty legislation of a controversial nature.

<a name="aliy">Ali Yar Beg regains National badminton title</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
By Muhammad Yaqoob

LAHORE, Aug 6: Using vast experience and better stamina, Ali Yar 
Beg of Allied Bank (ABL) overpowered the spirited team-mate  Wajid 
Ali to win the closely-contested men’s singles final of the 43rd 
National Badminton Championship by two games to one at the Iqbal 
Parks Sports Complex, gymnasium hall on Thursday.
    
Ali Yar won the 80-minute gruelling final 7-15, 15-14, 15-9.
    
Ladies singles champion Asma Butt (PIA) earned the double crown. 
She defeated Aysha Akram (NBP) by two games to one to retain the 
ladies singles title for the consecutive fourth time with a 
scoreline of 9-11, 11-8, 11-3.
    
Earlier, Asma, pairing with her sister Uzma Butt, toppled Aysha 
Akram and Afshan Shakeel (NBP) in the doubles final 18-16, 15-6.
    
Defending champions Haroon Kaleem with Tahir Ishaque (WAPDA) 
retained the men’s doubles title, defeating the pair of Asadullah 
Aleem and Tariq Mahmood of Karachi Port Trust (KPT) 5-15, 15-8, 15-
12.
    
Ali Yar Beg, 28, who won the men’s singles after two years, displayed fine
anticipation and hit sizzling shots after losing the 
opener 7-15. It was 7-all in the first game. But the last 
year junior champion Wajid Ali, 18, grabbed point after point and 
won convincingly 15-7.
    
One-down, Ali Yar Beg built up a 6-1 lead in  the second game. The 
lanky left-hander Wajid Ali showed great potential and it was 7-7. 
With powerful smashing and excellent services Wajid came near to 
victory when he led 11-6. From there onwards,  Ali Yar Beg had well 
read Wajid’s weak back hand. He started to exert pressure and 
neutralised the crunch game at 12-12. Later it was 13-13 and 14-14 
before Ali Yar won.

KARACHI, Aug 6: The Selection Committee of the Pakistan Hockey 
Federation (PHF) on Thursday announced a 16-man revamped Pakistan 
Senior hockey squad for the XVI Commonwealth Games to be staged at 
Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) from Sept 10 to 20.
    
In addition, the selectors also named 12 stand-byes for the team.
    
The names were read out by the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) 
Secretary, Col. Syed Mudassar Asghar, on behalf of the PHF 
President, former Olympian Akhtar Rasool Chowdhry, at a jointly-
held Press conference.
    
The Pakistan squad is as follows:
    
GOALKEEPERS: Mohammad Qasim and Ahmed Alam.
    
BACKS: Danish Kalim, Tariq Imran and Ali Raza.
    
MIDFIELDERS: Mohammad Usman, Irfan Yousaf, Waseem Ahmed and Irfan 
Mahmood.
    
FORWARDS: Haider Hussain, Mohammad Sarwar, Atif Bashir, Mohammad 
Farooq, Anis Ahmed, Mohammad Khalid and Babar Abdullah.
    
The 12 stand-byes are: Hamid Ali, Saleem Aamir, Ziauddin, Sohail 
Abbas, Asad Ali Qureshi, Mubashir Hussain, Fraz Haider, Mohammad 
Irfan, Naveed Asim, Naveed Iqbal, Ejaz Rasul and Ejaz Ahmed.
    
The Pakistan World Cup star sohail Abbas has been dropped from the 
main squad as his utility as a penalty corner specialist after the 
change of the substitution rule has been minimised and the other 
aspects of his game need considerable improvement.
    
The Pakistan squad and reserves were picked after two days of 
trials by a four-member Selection Committee, chaired by Senator Mir 
Zafarullah Khan Jamali. The three other selectors are former 
Olympians Dr.Khawaja Tariq Aziz, Hanif Khan and Col. Mudassar 
Asghar (co-opted).

<a name="comm">Commonwealth Games: Pakistan cricket team announced</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Ilyas Beg

LAHORE, Aug 3: A 14-member Pakistan team, comprising  a handful of 
Test players and mostly youngsters, was announced on Monday for the 
cricket event of the 16th Commonwealth Games to be organised at 
Kuala Lumpur from Sept 11 to 21.
    
Somewhat experienced players include dashing batsman Basit Ali (re-
inducted in the side and made captain of Pakistan team in the Super 
Eight Tournament), good opener Saleem Elahi, a forceful stroke-
player and left-arm spinner Muhammad Husain, Test off-spinner 
Arshad Khan, left-hand batsman Akhtar Sarfaraz and pacemen Shahid 
Nazir and Shoaib Akhtar.
    
Youngsters Muhammad Javed, Kashif Ahmad, Taimur Khan, Salman Huda, 
Asif Mahmood and Azhar Shafiq have been included in the side at the 
expense of many better performers during the domestic cricket 
season. Javed Qadeer is the only wicketkeeper included in the team. 
Incidentally, he had also accompanied Basit Ali’ team to Kuala 
Lumpur like Taimur Khan, Saleem Elahi and Muhammad Husain to play 
in the Super Eight Tournament a few weeks ago.
    
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) public relations director Lt.-Col. 
(retd.) Rafi Nasim announced the names of the boys. However, the 
announcement of captain and manager of the team has been withheld. 
The re-constituted national selection committee had finalised the 
team in its first meeting under  former wicketkeeper Wasim Bari at 
Karachi on July 28 but the names of the players have been made 
public after seeking approval from the PCB council members on 
telephone.

<a name="sele">Selectors include Malik but leave out Younis</a>
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Samiul Hasan

KARACHI, Aug 4: The national selection committee included discarded 
Test batsman Salim Malik but have omitted speedster Waqar Younis 
from the provisional 18-man team for next month’s Sahara Cup, it is 
learnt.
    
According to sources in the PCB secretariat, the selectors would 
finalize the 14-man team for the Canadian series around Aug 22 from 
the tentative team they prepared on July 28  the day they 
finalized the Commonwealth Games side.
    
Informed sources said Malik and Younis received contrasting favours 
from the selectors purely on their performance. Malik, who has 
scored 6,884 runs in 268 one-dayers, proved that he was not a spent 
force yet when he accumulated 395 runs from seven National One-day 
Championship innings. On the first-class scene, he scored 414 runs 
at 34.50 with a top score of 124.
    
On the contrary, Younis received harsh treatment in the one-dayers 
on African safari. He conceded more than run-a-ball in six matches 
which saw him concede 347 runs (from 336 balls) and take seven 
wickets.
    
In the last season, Younis played 15 matches in which he picked up 
16 wickets at 45.87. His economy rate was 5.47.
    
However, he is the second most successful Pakistan bowler in one-
dayers after Wasim Akram. He has taken 281 wickets in 171 matches.
    
Malik’s last Test innings was against Sri Lanka in which he scored 
155 to engineer a draw for Pakistan. Sahara Cup was his last one-
day tournament in which he scored 132 runs but was later dropped 
because of `attitude problem.’
    
Malik’s return to the national team would largely depend on the 
interim report of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) probe committee 
which is investigating the charges of match-fixing and betting. The 
committee is expected to hold a final meeting on Aug 15 to record 
the statements of Salim Malik, Ijaz Ahmad and Inzamamul Haq who 
failed to reach Quetta on Aug 2 after missing the flight.
    
In the light of that report, the cricket board would direct the 
selectors which of the players were not available for selection. As 
the situation stood on July 28, the authorities had told the 
selectors to consider every player.
    
The three-member selection committee have also retained both the 
frontline wicketkeepers Rashid Latif and Moin Khan but have minced 
no words in saying that only one would go to Canada.
    
The selection of a wicketkeeper, nevertheless, would be decided 
before the selection committee meeting on Aug 16 when the executive 
council meets in Lahore to appoint the captain and coach of the 
senior string. If Latif is retained as captain, Moin Khan will have 
to face the anomaly of being relegated as No 2 wicketkeeper. 
However, the status would take a U-turn if the executive council 
decides to replace Rashid Latif as captain.
    
Informed sources said Aamir Sohail was the frontline candidate for 
the job. Moin Khan was being considered as his deputy.
    
There was a strong possibility that the Commonwealth Games team 
might be changed if Wasim Akram is not available. If Akram is 
unfit, Shoaib Akhtar would be pulled out from the Commonwealth 
Games and included in the Sahara Cup side. No replacement would be 
made in the Commonwealth Games side which will be reduced to 13 
players.
    
The selectors have picked two specialist spinners viz Mushtaq Ahmad 
and Saqlain Mushtaq but their availabily remains unconfirmed.
