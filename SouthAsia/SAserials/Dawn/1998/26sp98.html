PM seeks parity with India on CTBT issue
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Masood Haider

NEW YORK, Sept 23: Pakistan will adhere to the CTBT only in 
conditions free from coercion and pressure and will insist on being 
accorded equal treatment with India, in terms of status or 
incentives, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif told the UN General 
Assembly on Wednesday.
    
“There is no reason why India and Pakistan cannot adhere to the 
CTBT. In a nuclearized South Asia, CTBT will have relevance if both 
the countries are party to it,” he said.
    
Mr Sharif, who was expected to make a “positive statement” and 
possibly announce an unequivocal commitment to sign the CTBT, 
stopped short of doing so and couched his words in diplomatic 
phrases which can be interpreted either way  Pakistan is ready to 
sign and Pakistan will not sign until its conditions are met.
    
He also touched on other important issues in his address, including 
Kashmir, Palestine, Afghanistan, Bosnia and North-South dialogue.
    
He said all nuclear-capable states, including India, must adhere to 
the CTBT before it could come into force.
    
Pakistan, he said, would oppose any attempt to change this 
fundamental requirement at the conference of states, parties to the 
treaty, scheduled to be held in Sept 1999. “Such a change can only 
be made by consensus. Pakistan is, therefore, prepared to adhere to 
the CTBT before this conference. However, its adherence will take 
place only in conditions free from coercion or pressure.”
    
He said that on the nuclear issue Pakistan would insist on the 
principle of equal treatment with India, be it in terms of status 
or incentives. It must also be well understood that if India were 
to resume nuclear testing, Pakistan would review its position, and 
“in case we have adhered to the CTBT, invoke the supreme interest 
clause as provided under article 9 of the treaty.”
    
AFGHANISTAN: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Wednesday urged 
reconciliation within Afghanistan through realistic compromise and 
mutual accommodation.

    
“We ask for respect for the country’s sovereignty and territorial 
integrity, and observance of the principles of non- interference 
and non-use of force,” he said.
    
He called for the release of all prisoners held by the parties to 
the Afghan conflict and supported a UN and OIC fact-finding mission 
to Afghanistan.
    
He said that those responsible for the outrageous killing of 
personnel seized from the Iranian Consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif must 
be apprehended and punished.
    
KASHMIR: He said the UN, the major powers and the international 
community had a responsibility to support and facilitate a solution 
of the Jammu and Kashmir issue.
    
He appealed to the UN secretary-general to take appropriate 
initiatives to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir.
    
WORLD ECONOMY: Mr Sharif said the world economy was in recession. 
He said the world community must adopt a coherent approach to the 
current crisis. In the short-term, it was essential to spur 
economic growth in all parts of the world. 
   
The international financial institutions, he said, must relax their 
unrealistic conditionalities to prevent any further contraction of 
the economies of the developing countries. Mechanism needed to be 
devised to direct greater development finance to the underdeveloped 
countries which had the largest latent demand. Meanwhile, markets-
specially those of the industrialized must be kept open. New 
protectionism in the guise of concern for environmental or labour 
standards must be resisted, he added.

NA adopts FCA bill bypassing Senate
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Faraz Hashmi

ISLAMABAD, Sept 24: The freezing of the foreign currency accounts 
following nuclear detonation was given legal cover on Thursday when 
the National Assembly passed Foreign Exchange Temporary Restriction 
Bill 1998, which provides that the right to hold, sell, withdraw, 
transfer, pay or take out foreign exchange held by any person in 
Pakistan as on May 28, 1998, without the prior permission of the 
State Bank, shall remain suspended. 
    
The Senate was by-passed as the bill was treated as a money bill. 
According to Article 73 of the Constitution, a bill declared money 
bill cannot be taken up by the Senate.
    
The bill was passed by the lower house in the absence of PPP 
members who walked out in protest against what they said the 
government’s move to by-pass the Senate.
    
Opposition members contended that the foreign exchange restriction 
bill could not be treated as the money bill, while the treasury 
benches maintained that it comes under the purview of money bill.
    
The house before passing the bill by a voice vote rejected a number 
of amendments moved by the opposition members and a resolution to 
refer the bill to Islamic Ideological Council. The house also 
turned down a motion moved by Syed Naveed Qamar, MNA, calling for 
publicizing the bill to elicit public opinion.
    

Parliamentary Secretary for Finance Kamil Omar, who was piloting 
the bill before putting it to the house for voice vote, read out 
different clauses of Article 73 of the Constitution. He said that 
the bill envisaged conversion of foreign currency accounts into 
dollar bonds. The bill also involved remission of taxes as 
government was giving exemption of income tax and wealth tax on 
these bonds.
    
He claimed that under clause A of Article 73 remission of taxes 
should be treated as money bill.
    
Citing clause C of Article 73, he said any issue or deposit in the 
federal consolidate fund could be treated as money bill. The 
profits and losses of State Bank were covered by the Federal 
Consolidate Fund, therefore the bill could be treated as money 
bill.
    
Earlier, Naveed Qamar of the PPP said that the bill could not be 
treated as money bill as it had no nexus of the taxation policy of 
the government. Moreover, the government was not giving sovereign 
guarantees.
    
The government by by-passing the Senate was doing great injustice 
to the people of smaller provinces, he said.
    
Qaisar Sheikh, an independent MNA, said it was a very important 
bill as it had a direct bearing on the economy of the country.
    
He said the bill would completely shatter the confidence of the 
people in the government.
    
He called upon the government to immediately address to the problem 
of dual exchange rate. He said that a businessman intending to go 
abroad could not get dollars even from the open market, which, he 
said, was adversely affecting commerce and trade.
    
In the open market dollars were not available even at Rs61, he 
claimed.
    
During the last two years, rupees had been devalued by over 50 per 
cent and exports had declined by 15 per cent, he claimed.
    
Syed Khurshid Shah, Fahmida Mirza, Wajha Karim Dad, Bau Ghulam 
Hussain, Mir Hazar Khan Bijrani, Shakeel Baloch and Sana Baloch 
spoke against the bill.
    
They also termed it against Islam saying that the government had 
usurped the foreign currency accounts which had been deposited by 
the people as a trust with the nationalized banks.
    
Earlier, winding up discussion on the first reading of the bill, 
the parliamentary secretary for finance said that the confidence of 
the people was gradually building up. He said only 675,000 people 
which constituted 0.5 per cent of the total population had foreign 
currency accounts.
    
He said the foreign currency accounts had been frozen by the 
government in the wake of a very difficult situation.

Clinton agreed test was vital to Pakistan’s survival, claims PM
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

NEW YORK, Sept 23: President Bill Clinton told Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif in their meeting last Monday that Pakistan’s survival would 
have been at stake had it not carried out the nuclear tests in May, 
Mr Sharif disclosed on Tuesday night.
    

Speaking at a community dinner hosted by Ambassador Riaz Khokhar 
and attended by over 1,000 Pakistanis who paid 100 dollars each, 
the prime minister gave a frank account of his meetings with the US 
president, Secretary-General Kofi Annan, as well as his previous 
meetings with Indian prime ministers, including Mr Vajpayee.
    
As Mr Sharif spoke at the Manhattan Hilton hotel, a group of 
several dozen angry PML workers demonstrated against the PM. They 
carried placards and banners and raised slogans against Mr Sharif 
and his government. In retaliation the PML supporters danced at the 
tune of Bhangra in front of the hotel.
    
The remarks attributed to President Clinton surprised the audience, 
and many journalists and analysts who regularly cover Washington 
did not believe that these words would have been actually uttered 
by Mr Clinton as they would negate all the US policies of punishing 
Pakistan.
    
Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, when asked to explain the context of 
what the US president had said, told Dawn : “The PM had explained 
the situation after the Indian nuclear tests and had referred to 
the Indian threats over Kashmir and their belligerent statements 
against Pakistan.”
    
“Mr Clinton agreed that there was a security threat to Pakistan and 
by carrying out the tests Pakistan had tried to strengthen its 
security,” Mr Aziz said.
    
No immediate White House or State Department reaction was available 
but analysts covering the White House believed that a confirmation 
of Mr Clinton’s words may not be available in the words in which Mr 
Sharif had quoted him.
    
The prime minister said he had argued with President Clinton that 
by conducting the tests Pakistan had actually averted a war and an 
Indian aggression on Pakistan. “Instead of appreciating this fact 
and rewarding Pakistan for maintaining world peace, the US had 
punished Islamabad. There was no justification for the sanctions,” 
he had told the US president.
    
Mr Sharif also disclosed that on the issue of the F-16s, he had 
actually refused to discuss the matter with Mr Clinton. “When I 
reached the point of F-16 on my agenda list, I told Mr Clinton you 
may do whatever you want to do with the issue, I will not take it 
up with you,” Nawaz Sharif said.
    
He said that in 1990, sanctions were imposed against Pakistan and 
F-16s were denied, but the result was that today Pakistan had a 
nuclear bomb which was a far more effective weapon of deterrence 
than F-16 aircraft.
    
He said he had resisted world pressure put on him not to detonate 
the bombs after the Indian blasts in the larger national interest 
of Pakistan and he would do exactly that on the question of CTBT.
    
“If we find that CTBT is in our interest we will sign it, otherwise 
we will do what we think is in our best security interest,” Mr 
Sharif said.
    
About his talks with Indian PM Vajpayee, Mr Sharif said in all his 
previous meetings with Indian prime ministers, he had told them to 
discuss the core issue of Kashmir, if they sincerely wanted peace 
in the region.


On domestic issues, Mr Sharif did not ask the Pakistani community 
to send any money to Pakistan, as he had done last year when a fund 
had been created. But he assured the community that the foreign 
exchange accounts would be unfrozen when the situation stabilised.

Debts stand at Rs2.5 trillion, NA told
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 21: Parliamentary Secretary for Finance Sardar 
Kamil Omar on Monday informed the National Assembly that the total 
external and internal debts of the country on June, 1998 stood at 
Rs. 2.5 trillion.
    
The internal and external debts of the country in the last five 
years rose by Rs. 1.21 trillion, said Mr Kamil Omar while 
responding to a query during the question hour of the House.
    
Mr Omar also gave the figures of Pakistan’s external and internal 
debts in 1970s. He said it was only around Rs. 60 billion in late 
1970s but sharply rose because of wrong financial policies.
    
“We spent more and took wrong decisions,” he said deploring that 
the amount borrowed from internal and external sources was not 
utilised properly by the successive governments over the last two 
decades which landed the country in the present financial crisis.
    
Replying to a question about the impact of devaluation on the debt, 
he said, it registered an increase of Rs. 109 billion in one year 
because of devaluation.
    
He conceded that today the country could not meet its expenditures 
without taking foreign loans, which had become indispensable for 
debt servicing and other expenditures.
    
Mr Omar hoped that the vicious cycle in which the country had been 
trapped could be broken by concerted and sincere efforts over the 
next few years.
    
To a suggestion that the government should impose complete ban on 
dollars, he said, Malaysia had recently closed down their economy. 
Pakistan, he added, was committed to open economy and was not 
considering any such proposal to close down its economy. “There is 
no need to take such a drastic step at least for the time being,” 
he said.
    
He pointed out that the negotiations going on with IMF and World 
Bank had restored some confidence, stock market and currency 
markets had positively responded and things were improving 
gradually.
    
To a question about the bank defaulters, he said, the total default 
of all commercial banks and development financial institutions was 
Rs. 145 billion.

Gas tariff will not be raised, says Nisar
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondent

ISLAMABAD, Sept 24: Minister for petroleum and natural resources 
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan told the National Assembly on Thursday the 
government would carry out development works without raising the 
gas tariff.

    
Responding to question during the question hour, he said the 
present government has refused to increase gas tariffs despite 
pressures while the previous government had increased it three 
times.
    
He said the government was under pressure to enhance gas tariffs by 
30 to 40 per cent. He said there was a caretakers period proposal 
to enhance gas tariffs by 12 and 1/2 per cent but the present 
government did not go for it. He said that because of that 
financial constraints, the development process had to be cut down.
    
While responding to questions about inflated bills being received 
by the gas consumers in Karachi, the minister said the government 
was taking steps for the last several months to improve the 
situation. The concerned department, he said, is trying to send 
bills according to actual readings. He asked the members to let him 
know if the bills were not based on actual readings.
    
Asked by a member from FATA, the gas has not been provided to any 
areas in FATA, he posed question as to who would guarantee that the 
consumers in FATA would pay their bills.
    
Replying to questions about the criteria for provision of gas 
connections, he said that the gas connections/ gas meter is 
provided on first come first served basis on the submission by the 
applicant. He said that gas is supplied to those premises which are 
located on the existing gas distribution network.
    
He said that the Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd have installed from 
1-1-97 to 31-12-97 in all 104394 meters in eight regions of the 
country. But during 1998, the SGPL has installed 57199 new meters, 
he said. In reply to a question about supply of gas to Swat, the 
minister said that Swat has no access to gas. He volunteered 
information that in his own constituency there are not even one 
thousand new connections.
    
Replying to questions about daily local production of oil and gas, 
the minister said that there is average daily production of oil and 
gas to the tune of 61,984 barrels while average daily consumption 
as per budget estimates amounting to 399,750 barrels. He said that 
average daily production of gas is 2428 million cubic feet with 
2386 million cubic feet in winter and 1895 in summer.
    
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said that the budgeted foreign exchange 
requirements for import of deficit POL-products and crude oil is 
approximately dollars 2,136 million for financial year 1998-99.
    
Responding to a question about the number of private engineering 
universities, the House was informed that there is a mushroom 
growth of educational institutions in the private sector including 
engineering colleges. The parliamentary secretary told the House 
that it was very difficult to prepare a conclusive list of private 
engineering colleges in the country which is possible only if 
sufficient time and requisite resources for country-wide survey is 
provided. He provided a list of non-accredited institutions for 
engineering education which is as under:- Al-Hajvery Institute of 
Tech. and Engineering, Lahore; American University of Engg. and 
Tech. Lahore; International Islamic Engineering College, 

Rawalpindi; Islamabad Institute of Engineering and Management 
Sciences, Islamabad; Royal Institute of Engg. and Technology, 
Lahore; University of Computer Engineering/ Computer University, 
Lahore; Textile Institute of Pakistan, Karachi.
    
Responding to measures being adopted to rationalise and streamline 
the institutions, the house was informed that (1) Education Policy 
1998 provides for encouraging establishment of higher education 
institutions in the private sector and UGC provides detailed 
procedure/ guidelines for the establishment of such institutions in 
the private sector. The House was given the salient features of the 
National Education Policy, 1998.

All-time high rise in KESC rates
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Shamim-ur-Rehman
    
KARACHI, Sept 22: Karachiites have been subjected to an 
unprecedented increase in the security deposit for new electricity 
connections. There has been no change for the rest of the country.
    
This unbelievably exorbitant increase is over and above the burden 
of fuel adjustment charges, additional surcharges, and the 
generally manipulated and inflated bills based on arbitrary 
readings.
    
The unannounced increase by the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation 
has been widely condemned and termed the step-motherly attitude of 
the government towards the people of Karachi.
    
Strong criticism was voiced when the minister of state for water 
and power, Haleem Siddiqui, on the floor of the Senate, had 
recently admitted that the security deposit for new connections in 
Karachi had been increased from Rs500 to Rs50,000.
    
The increase has been made effective from 1997 though this is not 
reflected in the annual report for the financial year.
    
Under the new formula, the security deposit has been classified on 
the size of plot whereas previously it was charged on the basis of 
load allocation, as shown in the table.
    
Opinion leaders say the increase is yet another burden on the 
people of Karachi. It is aimed at making it impossible for the poor 
people to get new connections, they say.
    
Under the rules security deposit of up to 10-week consumption is 
required but the new formula does not take that into account and 
the rate has been fixed by the KESC on the basis of the average 
consumption over three months, as reflected in the inflated average 
bills sent out to consumers.
    
The phenomenal increase in electricity charges in recent bills is 
the result of the “unilateral” increase in rates without taking the 
actual consumption into account.
    
A harried KESC consumer said the people would “challenge the KESC’s 
unilateral decision in the court because it is based on fictitious 
average figures fed into the computer for different localities to 
generate revenue.”
    
The issue came to the foreground when PPP senator Iqbal Haider drew 
the attention of the house to the exorbitant increase in security 
deposits from Rs500 to Rs50,000 by the KESC.

    
The minister of state, at first, denied outright that there had 
been any increase and said it was still charged on the basis of 
eight-to-10-week consumption, as spelt out in the electricity law. 
But then he said Rs500 was charged when electricity was very cheap 
and now the KESC had selected an area and calculated its average 
billing following which the tariff was increased.
    
But, he maintained: “We are not increasing it. What we intend to do 
and we may do is not yet decided. It is yet under discussion as to 
whether or not we should keep security deposit of eight-to-10-week 
for every consumer as per the electricity law”.
    
The general secretary of the KESC shareholders association, 
Chaudhry Mazhar, however, said the KESC was charging according to 
the new formula from 1997. He said an objection was raised by him 
in the annual general meeting but the KESC management did not 
listen.
The government had no explanation as to why the KESC had effected 
such an exorbitant increase when the WAPDA had not done so. The 
government’s point of view is that there cannot be any comparison 
since WAPDA operated a the basis of a system different from that of 
Karachi. “Karachi Electric Supply Corporation is an independent 
entity, it has a corporate structure. It is different from WAPDA,” 
Haleem Siddiqui had told the Senate recently in support of the 
increase.
    
He said the government had not increased the charges for small 
consumers but had levied them on big consumers because generally 
they were major defaulters.
    
“We have to take into account the security of the company”, he said 
adding: “We also have to take into account the outstanding and bad 
debts which we have not been able to recover.”

MQM asks govt to withdraw CA-15
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Bureau Report

ISLAMABAD, Sept 25: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement, (MQM), on Friday 
called upon the government to withdraw the proposed 15th Amendment 
Bill and expressed apprehension that it would promote sectarianism 
in the country.
    
The parliamentary group leader of the MQM, Sheikh Liaquat, 
reiterated his party’s resolve to oppose the CA-15 and the signing 
of the CTBT as the house resumed discussion on the proposed 
amendment.
    
Mr Liaquat opposed the bill, particularly the amendment to Article 
193 of the Constitution which sought to vest special powers in the 
office of the prime minister. He said that there was no 
justification of making such amendments to the constitution.
    
The powers being given to the prime minister today could be misused 
by any future government, he feared. “Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif 
is an honest man, but what will happen if somebody else, who is not 
honest, becomes the prime minister tomorrow,” he said.
    
Claiming that the 15th Amendment Bill would change the whole 
complexion of the Constitution, Mr Liaquat urged the legislators to 
protect the constitution.

    
Pir Aftab Shah Gilani of the PPP termed the CA-15 a crude attempt 
of the prime minister to acquire more powers. Nobody can oppose the 
supremacy of Islam and Sunnat, he said.
    
The government in the name of Islam and Sunnat wanted to distort 
the 1973 Constitution which has a number of provisions for the 
enforcement of Islamic laws in the country.

Software park to be set up in Karachi
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Reporter

KARACHI, Sept 21: A meeting of the representatives of local 
software industries and Sindh government on Monday decided to set 
up a software technology park on a 50 acre plot in North Karachi 
industrial area.
    
The idea for setting up this park was sponsored by Sindh 
government, which was discussed in more than three meetings with 
the representatives of the local software companies and the 
relevant bodies and was given final shape on Monday.
    
Designed to be developed on lines of world fame Silicon Valley in 
Southern Indian city Bangalore, the proposed software technology 
park will be given all those facilities which are enjoyed by the 
export processing zones in the country. For this purpose, Sindh 
government is submitting a proposal to Islamabad. It is likely to 
be named Indus Valley Park.
    
Sindh government has offered a 50 acre plot in Karachi where 
businessmen would be invited to develop facilities either built own 
and operate or built, own and transfer basis.
    
Officials in Sindh government indicated of inviting such bids from 
private developers within a month’s time after complying with all 
the formalities.
    
According to these officials, there are about 350 registered 
software companies in the country of which 60 per cent or about 200 
are in Karachi and a large number of these firms have shown their 
interest to set up facilities in the proposed park.
    
Officials look confident of the proposed park attracting at least 
150 companies for setting up their units because of its close 
proximity to Karachi University, other educational centres of 
higher learning in close vicinity and more than half a dozen 
industrial enclaves in and around the city.
    
They said the proposed park has the capacity for expansion in the 
future. Karachi, they contend still remains the hub of commercial 
and industrial activities in the country and will be a ready market 
for the facilities to be developed by the investors in the park.
    
A committee was formed in the meeting held on Monday. It has been 
asked to submit a report within 30 days to the government on the 
development and operation of the park. The committee will also 
quantify the requirement of electricity, water, gas, telephone 
lines and other facilities in the park.
    
The committee is headed by the Managing Director SITE Limited and 
includes a representative of Cresoft, Software Board, Pakistan 
Computer Society, Pakistan Software House and SITE Association of 
Trade and Industry.
